								<div class="inner" id="msg_155099">This is pretty sad. Colin Powell just endorsed Obama on Meet The Press, which isn&#039;t the sad part. I wanted to look around at the news that&#039;s going up about this to see what people&#039;s responses are, mainly in the comments sections because that&#039;s where you get an idea of each party&#039;s talking points. Of course, the Obama supporters are happy that he endorsed Obama, as McCain&#039;s supporters would&#039;ve been if he&#039;d supported McCain. Despite the Iraq war, Powell is still seen as one of the more respectable figures in politics. More of my concern was if the crazier Republicans would start discrediting Powell&#039;s views and opinion immediately. <br /><br />I&#039;m not seeing a whole lot of people saying things like &quot;Well that&#039;s too bad. I generally respect Powell&#039;s opinion, but I disagree with him on this.&quot; What I am seeing is stuff like &quot;Obama and Powell are Black. Is this NEWS,&quot; &quot;Had Powell endorsed McCain he would be accused of being an Uncle Tom by the left wing lunatics, many here assembled,&quot; and &quot;Shame on Colin Powell for endorsing a Chicago thug with ties to Ayers, Pfleger, and Rev Wright--American haters.&quot; Those are exact quotes. This is the stuff that&#039;s destroying the Republican party at this point, and I blame McCain for this with the tone of hate his campaign took on a couple weeks ago. It&#039;s going to be hard for them to shake that. <br /><br />While I admittedly don&#039;t have a whole lot of Republican friends and family members (not on purpose, mind you), the ones I do have are not happy with McCain and especially don&#039;t like Sarah Palin. In their attempts to paint Obama as a Muslim terrorist as well as their going right along with all these bank bailouts and buyouts, the Republican party doesn&#039;t seem to have much of a defined platform anymore aside from this relatively new &quot;family values&quot; thing that lures in the evangelicals, and the idea of small town people being superior to those elitist coastal liberals. How do the Republicans here feel about this? Do you truly like McCain/Palin and the direction the party has taken in recent months/years, or do you feel like the party is losing it?</div>

And who are you to judge what the &quot;mainstream Americans&quot; believe? The belief structure is far too vast to try to lump something in a small box. The same as abortion issues, religion has far too many points of view. What makes Wright&#039;s comments any less divisive than many of the white pastors from these midwestern mega-churches?<br /><br />And calling Ayers Obama&#039;s educational adviser? Come on, that&#039;s a stretch.&nbsp; They served on the same board. That&#039;s a far cry from Ayers being his educational adviser.&nbsp; He&#039;s not in any way associated with Obama&#039;s campaign.<br /><br />And as far as why Powell&#039;s endorsement carries far more weight than Leiberman&#039;s? That&#039;s easy. Lieberman has proven time and again he is a political opportunist and will do anything he can to get elected and push his own agenda, while Powell has consistency of declining to run for public office when he could have, and probably would have been president had he chosen to run.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_155305">While we have differing political perspectives, please billz even you have to see there is something terribly wrong with the Republican party and this campaign.<br /><br />I agree that the McCain campaign proper is not painting Obama as a terrorist. That’s because the McCain campaign proper is essentially over. It’s been taken away from him, not by Barack Obama but the Republican Party itself. What we’re seeing now is the Palin 2012 campaign and based on my initial perceptions, it’s not going to be pretty.<br /><br />What Palin and the Republican party leadership is doing is reprehensible. Labeling Obama as ‘not one of us’ has many implications, at the least that he’s un-American and at worse a terrorist. The man was elected to the United States Senate and deserves a level of respect. To attack him with innuendo because of his name and to stoke the flames of bigotry is indefensible. <br /><br />Palin knows exactly what’s she doing and McCain does too, otherwise he wouldn’t have back-pedalled on some of her statements. Being promptly boo-ed for doing so by the party faithful was very telling for me. You may label them at crazy right-wing wackos but they seem ordinary to me – that’s the frightening part.<br /><br />As far as the ‘coastal elites’ are concerned, they may not have a clue but neither does Middle America. Last time I checked John McCain, a product of middle America had a much larger fortune and lifestyle than Barack Obama, also a product of Middle Amercia and to say either of them knows about the lives of an average Joe from anywhere in this country is a joke. <br /><br />And for all the talk of the bias of the coastal elites, I hope the irony of Sarah’s pallin’ around appearance on SNL, the un-American bastion of media elitism, isn’t lost on American public.<br /><br /></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_155312">Can you be specific in regard to what you consider tyranny? <br /><br />Do you really think an Obama administration will actually be worse than Bush’s ‘miss-steps’?<br /><br />If you consider dismantling the American system of checks and balances, the foundation of our government and what makes our nation great, a miss-step then I don’t know what to think.&nbsp; <br /><br />Yelling out ‘terrorist’ at a McCain rally is not McCain’s fault and to his credit he has tried to rebuke people for doing so. Sarah Palin, darling of the Republican party, has not and seems to be encouraging such behavior. If she is the Republican’s ideal future, then I’m truly fearful.<br /><br />McCain is the problem with McCain. Many people consider him to be a political opportunist as well. His wavering commitment to the Republican party after the 2000 [edit] presidential campaign, the ‘will he’ or ‘won’t he’ defect to the Democrats drama didn’t sit well with many people in either party. I used to have great respect for the man but he’s greatly diminished in my view after his actions during the 2004 campaign. McCain’s kow-towing to and his complete turn-around in support for Bush, especially in light of the smear campaign that Bush waged in 2000 was extremely disappointing and very un-maverick. <br /><br />One thing we can agree on: McCain isn’t an extension of Bush -- he’s worse. McCain sold out his principles to keep his seat at the table.<br /></div>

So much of what he does and has done, imho, has been purely political expedience, and not necessarily true substance.<br /><br />And yeah, there are some questions in my mind about a super majority, but I guess I kind of view the possibility of it as a balance to the last 8 (well, 6.5) years of Republican rule. Bring things back to equilibrium.&nbsp; Hopefully balance out the supreme court again, and as mentioned, checks and balances, which have been shredded by the signing statements Bush has employed so regularly.</div>

His admission to the Navel academy was out of his family background. He had the opportunity to be released as a POW early because of his family (and to his absolute credit passed that chance up, I don&#039;t know I would be able to do the same). And his current wealth, which far exceeds Obama&#039;s.<br /><br />Why is higher education so frowned upon in this country? The fact that Obama went to Harvard being a black flag against him is just crazy to me.<br /><br />&quot;Oh no! Fear the intellectually curious at all costs!!!&quot;</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_155317">This wasn&#039;t meant to be another McCain vs Obama thread. This was meant to be an Individual Republicans vs The Republican Party thread. I don&#039;t expect any true Republicans to be thrilled by Obama. I expect more of them to sooner not vote at all or maybe vote for a third party candidate, the way a lot of Democrats who weren&#039;t thrilled by Al Gore voted for Nader in 2000. I still find it sad that a lot of people are discrediting Powell&#039;s opinion because of his race, and it&#039;s not just random internet wackos; it&#039;s Rush Limbaugh and now some columnist from the Kansas City Star (it popped up on Google News). It&#039;s as if Powell said nothing to explain his reasoning or his line of thought. These idiots just see a black man supporting another black man.<br /><br />Regarding this, Billz: &quot;As far as small town America, the point, or at least the perception, is that the coastal elites don&#039;t have any idea what life is like there.&nbsp; You just said yourself that you know only a handful of Republicans.&quot; You missed my point there. My point was that I don&#039;t like anyone who runs for president that tries to pit these two demographics against each other, because many small town folks also don&#039;t know what life is like where I live, and they don&#039;t have a lot of liberal buddies of the likes that live in a place like New York City - it goes both ways. Powell addressed this in his endorsement on Meet the Press, about how damaging it is to America as a whole to go along campaigning this way, as if the small towns are the ones that really matter, and the suggestion that those people are the true Americans. It&#039;s insulting, not only to the millions of &quot;true Americans&quot; who do not live in small town America, but to the intelligence of the people being spoken to. <br /><br />I also disagree that the McCain campaign proper isn&#039;t trying to paint Obama as a Muslim terrorist. Why do you think they keep pounding this Bill Ayers issue into the ground? It certainly isn&#039;t because of his education policies or because he protested the Vietnam war. It&#039;s because they get to say that Obama pals around with terrorists - and, BECAUSE OF 9/11, the people who are more impressionable by this political attack will automatically think Muslim terrorist, because these same people are afraid that Obama is a Muslim. Like Powell said, it&#039;s demagoguery. </div>

It&#039;s not only foreigners who come to NY, there are many, many people who come here from elsewhere in the US- some to escape, some for opportunity, some just to see what it&#039;s like. Why do all these people get discounted in the small town vs urban elite discussion? and what about the &quot;urban elites&quot; who get sick of the big city and move out to the farm? The world is not black and white, or small town/ big city-lets not forget that.<br /></div>

Between voting in favor of both versions of the bailout bill, proposing that the government buys bad mortgages, and speaking out against big corporate bonuses, McCain has been the anti-Republican during this whole economic crisis. And most other Republicans opposed the bank bailout bill until it was filled with enough pork to suit them. Then you have these pro-America comments from Palin&#039;s speeches, and of course the nearly simultaneous comments from Michele Bachmann about how there should be an investigation to see which members of congress are pro-America and which are anti-America. And the whole party just basically looks like it&#039;s completely lost its direction. Hence this thread.<br /><br />I was really hoping we could have a discussion about this, again, without getting into another McCain vs Obama thing or without the individual Republicans getting really defensive on the matter. Rest assured, Billz, I am not attacking you, and I am not saying Republicanz R Dumb. I was inspired to make this thread after hearing a family member, who is a fiscal conservative and has always voted Republican for that reason, express his unhappiness with McCain&#039;s comments and suggestions regarding the economy; and after a moderately Republican friend said that her very Republican parents didn&#039;t like McCain because they don&#039;t think he&#039;s &quot;a real Republican.&quot; I know another guy who&#039;s a veteran and essentially a libertarian and is voting for McCain/Palin because of McCain&#039;s military support and because he thinks Obama wants to ban guns, which hasn&#039;t even been something they&#039;ve talked much about. But the NRA has been heavily campaigning against Obama and has endorsed McCain, so he has the gun-rights vote pretty well locked up. <br /><br />But aside from that and the pro-life issue, he doesn&#039;t seem to have much of a platform at all at this point, and neither does the party as a whole anymore. I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s only temporary because everyone&#039;s running around like a chicken with its head cut off during this economic situation, or if the family-values/anti-terrorism/pro-America platform has taken over the party to such an extent that they forgot about everything else they supposedly stood for.<br /><br />If you think the Democrats are going through the same identity crisis, that&#039;s fair enough, but I don&#039;t. And I consider myself an Independent, so I&#039;m not afraid to call out Democrats for being idiots the way they were in the 2004 election. This just seems to be a much better year for them, and Obama is running a much more coherent and clearly defined campaign than McCain is, and particularly one that should satisfy Democrats while not totally alienating those who are not Democrats.</div>

Between voting in favor of both versions of the bailout bill, proposing that the government buys bad mortgages, and speaking out against big corporate bonuses, McCain has been the anti-Republican during this whole economic crisis. And most other Republicans opposed the bank bailout bill until it was filled with enough pork to suit them. Then you have these pro-America comments from Palin&#039;s speeches, and of course the nearly simultaneous comments from Michele Bachmann about how there should be an investigation to see which members of congress are pro-America and which are anti-America. And the whole party just basically looks like it&#039;s completely lost its direction. Hence this thread.<br /><br />I was really hoping we could have a discussion about this, again, without getting into another McCain vs Obama thing or without the individual Republicans getting really defensive on the matter. Rest assured, Billz, I am not attacking you, and I am not saying Republicanz R Dumb. I was inspired to make this thread after hearing a family member, who is a fiscal conservative and has always voted Republican for that reason, express his unhappiness with McCain&#039;s comments and suggestions regarding the economy; and after a moderately Republican friend said that her very Republican parents didn&#039;t like McCain because they don&#039;t think he&#039;s &quot;a real Republican.&quot; I know another guy who&#039;s a veteran and essentially a libertarian and is voting for McCain/Palin because of McCain&#039;s military support and because he thinks Obama wants to ban guns, which hasn&#039;t even been something they&#039;ve talked much about. But the NRA has been heavily campaigning against Obama and has endorsed McCain, so he has the gun-rights vote pretty well locked up. <br /><br />But aside from that and the pro-life issue, he doesn&#039;t seem to have much of a platform at all at this point, and neither does the party as a whole anymore. I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s only temporary because everyone&#039;s running around like a chicken with its head cut off during this economic situation, or if the family-values/anti-terrorism/pro-America platform has taken over the party to such an extent that they forgot about everything else they supposedly stood for.<br /><br />If you think the Democrats are going through the same identity crisis, that&#039;s fair enough, but I don&#039;t. And I consider myself an Independent, so I&#039;m not afraid to call out Democrats for being idiots the way they were in the 2004 election. This just seems to be a much better year for them, and Obama is running a much more coherent and clearly defined campaign than McCain is, and particularly one that should satisfy Democrats while not totally alienating those who are not Democrats.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />First off, I&#039;m sorry if I&#039;m about to go deeper into McCain versus Obama than you&#039;d like, but the direction of either party at the moment is typified by the presidential election.<br /><br />I&#039;m a proponent of small government.&nbsp; So I am not thrilled with the big spending of the Bush administration.&nbsp; I do think that the Republicans need a reality check in that regard.&nbsp; I think that reality check began with the last midterm election, in which many Republicans were beaten by blue dog Democrats espousing what were essentially fiscally conservative principles.&nbsp; <br /><br />I was personally against the bailout package, because as a free market capitalist, I believe that the risks and rewards should be borne by the market.&nbsp; Wall Street was happy to make big profits on their risks, and now they should take their lumps.&nbsp; I am also very uncomfortable with what is essentially the nationalization, a la Hugo Chavez, of the bulk of our mortgage industry and many of our banks.&nbsp; I will note, though, that there was not monolithic Republican support for the bailout.&nbsp; Many Republicans (and Democrats for that matter) did the right thing and stood against the plan.&nbsp; I think that the market crash is of such dire importance that most people in congress recognized that something had to be done and done quickly.&nbsp; The divisions were not along the traditional ideological lines.&nbsp; And at the end of the day, many Republicans, as well as Democrats, screwed up.<br /><br />And I can confirm that from my observations, many Republicans don&#039;t view McCain as a &quot;real&quot; Republican, or at least are not excited about his candidacy.&nbsp; There weren&#039;t really any exciting candidates in the pot this cycle.&nbsp; I, myself, was not anywhere near as excited at the prospect of McCain&#039;s candidacy as I was in 2000 when he somehow seemed fresh.&nbsp; This sense of McCain not being a &quot;real&quot; Republican comes largely from social conservatives, as McCain is mostly a social moderate.&nbsp; Also, McCain has stood with the other side on some bipartisan measures that were just awful ideas.&nbsp; I agree with what I think you said earlier, that those people are likely to not vote, rather than vote for McCain.<br /><br />As far as Palin, who I think you called out above, it&#039;s a dubious assertion that she is seen as the future of the Republican party.&nbsp; I think, all kidding aside, that she is more likely to become a TV personality after her term as governor ends.&nbsp; McCain brought her on because he had to do something bold and risky to make his campaign exciting to people, not because she was the most experienced candidate available.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think most Republicans would claim that she is worthy of a solo run in 2012.&nbsp; Personally, I hope they keep open the possibility of Gov. Jindal of Louisiana, who is doing great things there, and is also a young, energetic guy.<br /><br />The Republican party at this point has been hit with a perfect storm.&nbsp; McCain is a less exciting candidate than the charismatic Obama, who is also fortunate to have very little legislative record to have to defend. We&#039;ve hit tough economic times, which I attribute more to the subprime loans encouraged by liberal activists than anything, but McCain has been tied into that. And the current lackluster presidency has been used effectively as a weapon against him.&nbsp; <br /><br />But if the Democratic party has a more cohesive message, what is it?&nbsp; They have simply managed their candidate better.&nbsp; They have wonderful soundbites, and offer up what people really want in troubled times.&nbsp; Paternalistic reassurance.&nbsp; Their brand is &quot;we&#039;re not the other guy,&quot; and that is a good brand to use for this election cycle.&nbsp; The rhetoric is short on specifics, and those that are offered are terrible.&nbsp; Obama wants to give tax cuts to the 40 percent of Americans who don&#039;t earn enough to pay taxes in the first place.&nbsp; So it&#039;s not really a tax cut, per se, but an income redistribution. Foul idea.&nbsp; And to consider raising taxes on anyone else is just nuts at a time like this.&nbsp; The way out of the economic crisis is to encourage growth and entrepreneurship, not to try and tax our way out of it.<br /><br />I don&#039;t see either party coming out with any amazing prescriptive ideas to fix all of our problems.&nbsp; So I will vote for the best worst choice, so to speak.&nbsp; I just hope that the Democrats do not score a super majority in congress.&nbsp; I think most of you will concede that Pelosi and the rest of the leadership are more towards the left of the party.&nbsp; There will be effectively nothing to moderate Obama&#039;s policy wish list.</div>

We seem to have lost the politics of ideas, or ideals, in favor of the politics of personality. I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s because the politicians think we don&#039;t want to hear it in this age of mass media madness, or because they are afraid to say it. Most likely a little of both. <br /><br />That said, I think Obama perhaps has put himself out on the line a little bit more than man other politicians, and said things that go a little beyond the soundbites. I believe in redistributing the wealth, so did Adam Smith. so do most republicans I think, except that they don&#039;t want that redistribution going thru government hands- they would rather give some of their surplus to charity organization and recirculate it that way. And frankly, I would love to be able to tell the government what I want it to do with the money I give it... maybe we need to work a little bit harder towards that.<br /><br />What you said about the financial bailout is telling too. It&#039;s actually nice to see an issue that can split people not along party lines, but along ideological lines that go beyond party. Perhaps this too is due in part to the fact that the party line has lost coherence, but maybe that&#039;s not such a bad thing. This country does need to shake things up, looking at both sides might not be such a bad thing<br /><br />In terms of taxes- how do you give tax cuts to someone who isn&#039;t paying any taxes? that makes absolutely no sense. I think maybe you need to read the fine print on that one.<br /><br />And finally, I think that if the Republican party wants to have a future, people like Sarah Palin and George Bush have to be its past. Somewhere along the line there needs to be a return to the party&#039;s intellectual roots. this habit of lowering yourself to the lowest common denominator only ends up diminishing you and your party AND the country. <br /><br /><br /></div>

The problem with just giving to charity is that certain things would end up just not getting any money, or certain areas would end up overlooked. The idea is that the government <strong>should be</strong> able to look at the larger picture and see what is really needed. I know this is not always the case.<br />As for the bureaucracy, I&#039;m not sure that having a zillion different charity organizations would really end up working better.<br />And there are some things that you do need government oversight for- for example schools?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=12700.msg155787.html#msg155787">Quote from: Billz1981 on October 24, 2008, 06:07:53 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">With regards to taxes, and to clarify, I was making the same point you&#039;re making.&nbsp; It makes no sense to give tax &quot;cuts&quot; to people who are not paying taxes.&nbsp; This just amounts to free money for some at the expense of others.&nbsp; The Obama proposal would give tax credits or cuts to people who don&#039;t earn enough to pay income taxes and are getting the earned income tax credit.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No, my point is that it&#039;s a false accusation- if someone is not paying any taxes, a tax cut or credit makes absolutely no difference to them, because they are not going to be paying anything to begin with. a credit towards taxes you are not paying is meaningless, as is a cut in the taxes you are not paying. Unless I am missing something entirely here? The only way to cut taxes on people who don&#039;t pay any is by eliminating sales taxes- something I haven&#039;t heard anyone propose.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=12700.msg155787.html#msg155787">Quote from: Billz1981 on October 24, 2008, 06:07:53 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Not sure what you mean about Obama putting himself on the line and going beyond the soundbites, but I&#039;m happy to discuss.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />oh things like openly saying that he wants to redistribute the wealth and that there is nothing wrong with that, or I remember in a debate with Hillary where he fired back at someone who had asked a question about immigrants taking away jobs from black by saying that the two things were not related. Things that are not really politically correct I guess<br /><br />but really I am still in Awe of Colin Powell for pointing out that there is nothing wrong with being Muslim.</div>
