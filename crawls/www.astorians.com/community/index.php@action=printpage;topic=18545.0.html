				HI all. Just returned from a rally in support of helping young LGBTQ youth and young adults who are cared for by a number of organizations in the city including Ali Forney.&nbsp; What a wonderful event with so many people.&nbsp; While the event happened in Union Square in Manhattan, there were a number of Astorians there which was so appropriate given that the local center was vandalized the other day.&nbsp; <br /><br />As one of my clergy colleagues said, &quot;The most powerful words of the rally were spoken by the Director of Ali Forney (paraphrased) &#039;We stand in the light of day to say we are proud of our work on behalf of LGBTQ youth and young adults.&nbsp; We don&#039;t need darkness and a magic marker to make our statement.&#039; &quot;<br /><br />The actions of cowardly folks to speak out against the wonderful things that Ali Forney and others are doing to see that LGBTQ youth and young adults have a safe place to call home - when so often they have been thrown OUT of their own &quot;birth homes&quot; is a sad statement about some in our society.&nbsp; <br /><br />As a clergy person in the Astoria/Long Island City area, I stand proud to say that I support the work and ministry of Ali Forney and plan to get more involved to show, not by words, but by actions, that we are caring for ALL God&#039;s children, and especially those who are in a vulnerable state in their lives right now.<br /><br />LGBTQ youth and young adults - we love you - AND GOD DOES TOO!<br /><br />Pastor Paul B Milholland<br />Trinity Lutheran Church<br />The Welcome Place<br />Long Island City NY<br />corner of 31st Avenue and 37th Street

				::: gives Father Paul a big hug ::::::<br /><br />I just watched a documentary on 13 about a gay young man murdered by skinheads in France. It was heart wrenching and beautiful at the same time because of the honesty of the people. <br /><br />Dear god, how I cried.

				So sorry I&#039;ll miss the fundraiser.&nbsp; Have to be out east to do pre-marital counseling with a couple I will marry later in July.<br /><br />Let me know what I can do ahead of time, to help. Or even afterward.<br /><br />Blessings<br />Pastor Paul

				Kick off Gay Pride weekend with Out Astoria by joining us on Friday, June 25 at 8pm at Astoria Brewhouse (2850 31st Street and 30th Ave) for our monthly mixer. We have reserved Astoria Brewhouse&#039;s private upstairs entertainment space for the event!<br /><br />The cover this time will be $10 and here&#039;s why:<br /><br />In honor of Pride 2010, Out Astoria is doing something a little different this mixer. As we celebrate all that is great about the gay experience, it’s important to also remember that, for many younger members of our community, the act of coming out often means rejection from their families. It is estimated that about 40% of homeless youth in New York City are LGBT. Many were thrown out of their homes by their parents when they came out as lesbian, gay, or transgender; they often live on the streets rather than face harassment and abuse in the homeless shelter system.<br /><br />The Ali Forney Center (AFC)—the nation’s largest and most comprehensive organization dedicated to homeless LGBT youth—operates an emergency shelter for homeless LGBT youth in the basement of an Episcopal church here in Astoria. Out Astoria will donate all proceeds from the door to the AFC shelter in Astoria. In addition, we will have a donation box at the door and encourage attendees to bring along items to donate to the shelter—donations such as non-perishable food items for the pantry (e.g., pasta, rice, canned goods) and personal items for the residents themselves (e.g., deodorant, shampoo, laundry detergent). <br /><br />Out Astoria has established an ongoing relationship with the shelter. If you wish to learn how to volunteer your time or to donate food, sundries, clothing, linens (sheets, pillows, etc.), house wares, books, DVDs, or other items, please send a message to vicepresident@outastoria.com with “AFC shelter” in the subject line.<br /><br />So come join us on June 25 as we celebrate Pride in honor of the Stonewall generation and help some members of the next LGBT generation as struggle to blossom into the fabulous gays and lesbians who carry our legacy into the future.
