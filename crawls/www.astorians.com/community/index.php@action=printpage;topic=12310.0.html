				Besides my own apartment?<br /><br />I think the quays on 45th street and 30th avenue is good because the bathrooms are downstairs.<br />If you end up dropping some serious bombs in there and stink it up, no one upstairs will know it was you!<br /><br />Also, Rapture on 34th street and 28th avenue has 2 single person bathrooms. Might as well bring a newspaper with you.<br /><br />And McCaffrey and Burke, just because it already smells, so no one will notice while they are playing pool.<br /><br />&nbsp;:mrgreen:<br /><br />

				I second that, what&#039;s an upper decker?<br /><br />As far as going poopee ... I can&#039;t do it in a public place it has to be home or a private bathroom.&nbsp; The ONLY time I have had to use a public bathroom is when I&#039;ve had diarreah and when it&#039;s like that...it doesn&#039;t matter because the pain is so bad and the worry that you&#039;ll do it on the sidewalk is so bad that by the time you find a bathroom you&#039;re in a cold sweat.....<br /><br />God help the person that goes in after me.

				1. upper decker<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />The act of defecating in the upper tank of the toilet. When the next poor unsuspecting person flushes the toilet they get a bowl of beef stew. the upper decker is a weapon of terror and should only be used on people who deserve it.<br /><br />&quot;My friends x-girl friend had a party and she left with some other dude who looked like the fonz &quot;Heyyy!&quot;. So I took it upon myself to leave her an upper decker&quot;<br /><br /><br />2. upper decker<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Also referred to as &#039;Going Up Top,&#039; the act of taking a s___ in the tank of a toilet. Common courtesy not to flush. Used TP should be placed inside drawers, magazines, or the tank itself. Feel free to throw in any other items you can find in the bathroom during the process.<br />&quot;Man this party sucks... I&#039;ll let &#039;em know how I feel with an Upper Decker&quot;<br /><br />3. upper decker<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />The act of defecating into the upper tank of a domestic toilet.<br />&quot;When they started playing charades, I took an upper decker and made a quick exit.&quot;<br /><br /><br />http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Upper+Decker
