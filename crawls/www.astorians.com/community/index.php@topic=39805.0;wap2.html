			Maybe it&#039;s a tv console. I dunno. It&#039;s going to get sent to a landfill though if no one wants it. Made out of a bunch of reclaimed pieces of other things, this piece is pretty big.<br />It&#039;s around 7-8&#039; long and 4&#039; high and around 2&#039; deep. <br />It&#039;s yours if you and a friend can carry it out of a 2nd floor walkup&nbsp; by Thursday (trash night).<br />Stool and table it&#039;s next to is not included. Probably should&#039;ve been moved before the picture was taken but it wasn&#039;t. <br />Ditmars/33 Street
