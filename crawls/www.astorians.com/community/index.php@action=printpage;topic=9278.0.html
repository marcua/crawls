				So I&#039;m going to LA soon, and unfortunately, we will have to rent a car for all of 6 hours on a Thursday.&nbsp; I never rent cars and love public transit, so of course this is pretty aggrevating.&nbsp; But in LA, you must drive, so we&#039;ll have to deal.&nbsp; We get into LAX round 11:30am, and must busy ourselves til my friend who lives there gets out of work at 6pm, and at that point won&#039;t be needing the car anymore.&nbsp; Does anyone have any recommendations on car rentals?&nbsp; We&#039;re having trouble finding rentals that are affordable either on an hourly or day (bring back Friday) basis, that pick up at LAX, and that don&#039;t charge an exorbitant amount to return to a different location.&nbsp; Alas, there is no zipcar option for the airport.&nbsp; We might just have to suck up the expense and deal, but were just wondering if anyone had any pleasant and positive recommendations/experiences with renting cars in LA...<br /><br />I&#039;m not asking anyone to look up information, just what company they rented from and if they liked them, and it was affordable.&nbsp; Thanks so much!

				I&#039;ve rented cars from LAX several times for several hours when we&#039;ve had something like an 8-hour layover.&nbsp; I&#039;ve always returned them to the airport, though.<br /><br />My experiences were with Fox rental and with National, I think, or possibly Enterprise.&nbsp; The first I rented through the Fox rental website, and I can&#039;t remember exactly how much it was, but it was probably around $30.&nbsp; We drove it to Santa Monica and back.&nbsp; The second time I scored an incredible deal through Orbitz -- a six hour rental cost me all of $12.&nbsp; We drove it to visit friends who couldn&#039;t drive because it was Shabbos, and back.&nbsp; The second time, we drove for a short enough distance that we were able to return the car without refueling or getting charged for a less-than-full gas tank, but I think we put a couple of gallons in the Fox rental.<br /><br />Both rentals were off-site, so that took some time, but it wasn&#039;t terrible.

				Is there a way you can take a car service to a zipcar location? Perhaps that is more acost effective solution than the return of a rental car to a different site?

				This is sorta convoluted, but . . . can your friend drive to LAX on their lunch break and you drive them back to work and then pick them up from work at the end of the work day?<br /><br />The other thought . . . if you have more than one friend in LA can you ask someone else to pick you up until your friend gets off of work?<br /><br />My last thought . . . during the summer of 2006 I flew to LAX with one of my sons&#039; laptops. I wasn&#039;t going to be able to get picked up for 4 hours and I was told that I could go to any of the following places and get wifi: <br />Terminal 1 Gates 3–10 <br />Terminal 2 all gates and the food court <br />Terminal 3 Gate 30 <br />Terminal 4 Gates 40–45 and the food court <br />Terminal 5 Gates 50–52 <br />Terminal 6 Gates 54–64 and Gate 67<br />Terminal 7 Gates 70–71<br /><br />You could sign on to astorians.com and tell us all about the weather!

				I use Enterprise in CA and got decent deals - Airport Car&nbsp; rentals always more expensive though. If you can get a cab to an off airport site might be good but cab will cost. I like the Orbitz idea. Unless your friend can totally chaufeur you - it might be a good idea to keep car a few days if you can get a deal.

				Hey thanks, guys.&nbsp; We&#039;re going with Enterprise, and we&#039;re returning it to the airport the next day.&nbsp; It&#039;s $32, and we&#039;re going to the Getty on Friday, so we&#039;ll be on that side of LA near the airport anyway.&nbsp; My friend will drive us around everywhere else.<br /><br />Unfortunately, contrary to popular belief, LA is not hot all the time.&nbsp; I thought I&#039;d get to wear my bathing suit - that was wishful thinking.&nbsp; It&#039;s going to be in the 60&#039;s, and in the 40&#039;s at night&nbsp; &nbsp;:x&nbsp; Sorry, Momma Mac!!&nbsp; I still have to wear long sleeves and a fall coat.&nbsp; But I guess it&#039;ll be somewhat better than here!
