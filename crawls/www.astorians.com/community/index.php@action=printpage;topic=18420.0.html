				last evening when i daughter was walking her small dog, a man walked up behind her. my daughter heard a terrible growl. she quickly grabbed her dog into her arms.&nbsp; &nbsp;the man didn&#039;t really try to get his dog away he seemed to be enjoying it.&nbsp; than he ran away with his dog very quickly.&nbsp; my daughter does not blame the dog she blames the owner he is making the dog mean. i can only tell you the dog is large white dog.&nbsp; many people have dogs here, and enjoy taking their dogs for a walk in the evening.&nbsp; i suggest be aware that there is that man walking this dog, and seems to want his dog to attack.&nbsp; he likes to sneak up behind you so his dog get close to your dog, to attack.&nbsp; please be careful, and if you see him get away fast.

				I think I know which guy you are talking about- his dog barked and snarled visciously like it wanted to attack my dog. Last time I saw this dog, it was on Ditmars around Crescent. (If we&#039;re talking about the same person)<br /><br />The idiot just stood there and looked at his dog like it was the right thing to do. Next time I see him, I&#039;m calling the cops, because this dog really sounded mean and viscious and the owner didn&#039;t seem to care. If the dog attacks or hurts someone, this jerk is responsible because he didn&#039;t train his dog properly. <br /><br />These are the types of morons who give pit bulls and rotweilers a bad name. These dogs are great and sweet, but some people refuse to raise or train them properly and end up with dangerous animals who don&#039;t know any better.

				I hate to say this but incidents like these are exactly why I cross the street whenever I see a potentially dangerous dog or owner coming my way.&nbsp; Sadly, this includes pitbulls.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been bitten before so my involuntary response is to keep as far away from the dog or owner as possible.&nbsp; Thanks for the warning.&nbsp; Unfortunately too many of these jerks train their dogs the wrong way and innocent lives are hurt or lost because of it.

				Not really on topic, but am the only one who noticed that Astoria seems to be awash in Pitbull and Jack Russel Terriers?<br /><br />I live up by Con-Ed and the river, and all the wannabe hard-cases around here own Pitbulls.&nbsp; Which is a shame, because they are not what you would call apartment dogs.

				We had a similar encounter in Astoria Park.....large white pitbull.&nbsp; Not sure if it&#039;s the same dog/owner, but the owner was a young Latin American/South American boy sporting a moronic grin and not a care in the world that his dog was tugging towards our dog with ill-intent.&nbsp; We quickly moved to the side on the grass and I placed myself between my dog and his - he seemed unconcerned, and as others have noted, almost happy that his dog was lunging towards our dog.&nbsp; It really pissed us off that such an immature schmuck was walking around the Park with such a dangerous dog.&nbsp; We walk our dog everyday in the park and are pretty familiar with dog owners in the neighborhood....this guy is definitely not a regular.&nbsp; I hope someone will be able to report him to the authorities because he should not be allowed to threaten the safetly of responsible dog owners.

				I stated this on the taxi thread yesterday.

				From all the descriptions, this seems to be the same guy we are all talking about here. <br />I haven&#039;t seen him around in a few days, has anyone else? Sadly, I&#039;m not sure there is any recourse unless his dog actually does something, no?

				Just a thought - has anyone been able to see whether the dog has a license sticker on his collar? My guess is no.<br />Most of the people who act this irresponsibly are usually the ones who don&#039;t have a license for their dog.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s reported whether the city would take any action though.

				Just got a call from the annimal cops of the Aspca and this is what they said to do about this situation<br /><br />&nbsp;My neighbor does not keep his dog restrained. His dog attacked my dog while we were out for a walk. Can he be arrested for animal cruelty or assault?<br />A: Under New York State law, the neighbor cannot be arrested for animal cruelty, animal fighting, or assault unless he or she instigated, ordered, or provoked the attack. In cases where this occurs, contact the NYPD to make a report. <br /><br />Nevertheless, it is a violation of the New York City Health Code for an owner to allow his or her dog to be off-leash in a public place. When an unrestrained dog attacks another animal, the owner of the injured animal should contact the New York City Health Department. The Health Department is responsible for enforcing the provisions of the Health Code, which include &quot;leash laws&quot; and the regulation and/or management of &quot;dangerous dogs.&quot; In addition, all animal bites must be reported to the Health Department at 311.<br /><br />

I walk my dog pretty frequently, and make it a point to note the dogs in the area, and I would have to say that the dog I see most often is probably a pomeranian or shih-tzu. This might only be true for the Ditmars area, but just my own observation.

				Pitbulls are a popular breed in many areas, especially in NYC, because they are the predominant breed in animal shelters. I&#039;d like to think that most people are thoughtful enough to get their dogs from animal shelters instead of breeders (though I know that&#039;s not necessarily true), which could very well result in a higher pit population, especially in more socially conscious neighborhoods like ours. Far too often pitbulls are automatically associated with the thug-like, irresponsible pet owner (like the one of the white dog referenced in the title of the thread), but in reality, many pits are owned by people like myself and my partner -- we&#039;re about as far from thuggy as possible (professionals, female, and incredibly responsible when it comes to our pets). <br /><br />Our dog is mixed pit/lab. We&#039;ve taken her to a trainer, she&#039;s been temperment tested to be allowed to board (at Camp Bow Wow), she even gives her vet kisses -- she&#039;s the sweetest, friendliest little princess -- but if she&#039;s on the street and gets scared, she&#039;ll growl, as most dogs would. Our vet was saying that every scar she has on her arms has been from chihuahuas, I&#039;ve had clothing destroyed by our neighbor&#039;s French Bulldogs (along with scratch and bite marks), and there are various dogs on our block that go crazy when they see another dog approaching -- none of them pitbulls. So please, don&#039;t think that all pitbulls and all pitbull owners are like the a$$hole on Ditmars Blvd. -- people like that are the exception, and not necessarily the norm.

				A couple of nights ago another small dog was attacked on 31st.&nbsp; and 25th ave.&nbsp; the dog that attacks seem to be the same white dog.&nbsp; &nbsp;the man that owns the dog travels by car seems to be looking for small dogs to attack.&nbsp; the small dog survived after being treated at the vets, for bite wounds.

All dogs are capable of being viscious. Some dogs are stronger than others and it&#039;s just a given that they have more potential to do damage. Raising a dog requires knowledge, persistence and understanding of your animal. People need to consider what caveats are before taking a dog into their home.

				This might just be the same big white dog that I&#039;m thinking. I have a brown lab, and ran into the owner and his dog twice already. This guy is a real jerk. My dog is really friendly when she see&#039;s other dogs, so she spotted this big white dog across the street, and started to pull to reach it, but I took one look and notice the dog didn&#039;t look so nice, so I continued to walk and the next thing I knew the owner with this big white dog had crossed the street to my side and stood right infront of me staring. I love dogs and grew up with them, and understand when a dog gets excited and jumps a lot when they see other dogs, because mine does this, but this dog did not seem excited at all, more like ready to attack. This was around 10pm at night on Ditmars and Steinway Street. I believe the dog is some type of Pitbull/Masstiff mixed breed about 100 pounds or more. I also remember seeing him tied up on a tree on 33rd &amp; Ditmars, and I didn&#039;t bother walking that direction. It seems like the owner takes pride in scaring other pet owners and their pets. This is not right and it should be stopped.

				Someone should report this guy to NYPD and the ASPCA animal cops. If he&#039;s using his dog to terrorize the neighborhood, imagine what he&#039;s probably doing to that poor dog. It&#039;s not the dog that&#039;s actively seeking out victims, it&#039;s his jacka$$ owner. People like that shouldn&#039;t have pets (or children, for that matter). The dog would be better off away from that guy, and the neighborhood would be better off if the mentally unstable guy didn&#039;t have a dog.

If I am around I will watch for the guy and take a picture (without confronting him directly) in order that some of you in here can better identify him.&nbsp; There is no reason for this guy to be terrorizing other people or dogs in a quiet residential area.&nbsp; The ASPCA would absolutely follow up on a complaint.&nbsp; Prior to a photo, poochies, will you try and describe him as best you can to give us an idea of what he looks like?
