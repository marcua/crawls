				Are there any?&nbsp; Ever since I went to my first race last year in Talladega, AL I&#039;ve been hooked.&nbsp; Just wondering if there were any other race fans in the area, and if there were any bars that showed races, not even Astoria specific, but in NYC in general.&nbsp; Buster&#039;s Garage used to show the races, but they&#039;ve since shut their doors.<br /><br />Also to discuss in this thread (if there is anyone out there who has any clue what I&#039;m talking about):<br /><br />-Will the Hendrick team continue to dominate this season?<br />-COT: thoughts, opinions?<br />-Any planned outings to any area tracks? (Dover or even the LI / NJ local tracks)<br />-Why can&#039;t Tony Stewart catch a break this season, and why is Mark Martin driving so damn well?

				Nice, my girlfriend and I are debating whether or not to go up to Watkins Glen for the race in August, and whether or not we&#039;re going to go back to Alabama for the October race at Talladega (we went to the April race last year which got rained out :( ). <br />There used to be a bar in Manhattan called Buster&#039;s Garage that used to show the races, but they&#039;ve since closed the garage doors.&nbsp; There&#039;s a bar in Greenpoint called The Pit Stop, which one can only assume would show races (I believe I&#039;ve seen budweiser #8 pennants hanging outside, I believe) but I&#039;ve never been inside, as I&#039;m usually riding my bike past it on my way somewhere else when I remember it.&nbsp; <br />I wish there was a place in the neighborhood that showed the races.&nbsp; I guess it&#039;s time to explore...

				There a few of us race fans scattered throughout the city, but I suspect that there is no money to made in showing races; I&#039;ve been to a couple of bars over the past few years that advertised racing, and either the bar closed or they switched to showing something, anything, else.&nbsp; My best luck has been rolling into a bar that is likely to be fairly empty on Sunday afternoon, and ask the bartender nicely if we can watch the race.&nbsp; East Village dives have been amenable to this in the past.&nbsp; But these days I like to watch at home; if one of those follow-the-leader, no-passing stretches comes up in the middle of the race, at, say, an aero-dependent cookie cutter, or if DW starts prattling on about some bull plop, then I can take a nap or at least turn down the TV and read the paper.&nbsp; <br /><br />But, if anyone does figure out a decent place in Astoria to watch the race, do share.&nbsp; It&#039;d be fun to have such a joint around.<br /><br />On a related note, has anyone noticed the proliferation of Nascar gear among the young Latino and African-American demographic in the city?&nbsp; I&#039;d be surprised if they are Dale Jr or Elliot Sadler fans.&nbsp; Is there any other significance to the trend?<br /><br />Odenhal, that sounds a lot like my Daytona parties! ;)&nbsp; <br /><br />
