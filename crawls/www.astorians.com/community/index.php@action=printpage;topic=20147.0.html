It is not a weather balloon, helicopter, plane or any of the such.<br /><br />Full Disclosure is needed by our US Government (the only government not to have already done so)<br />They will de-cloak themselves to the rest of the world within the what is termed FIRST CONTACT.&nbsp; <br /><br />As this video shows, they are already here, hanging in the balance.&nbsp; <br /><br />Another video, not my own, but a channeling explaining who these visitors are. Have an open mind and open heart.&nbsp; LISTEN!<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMazCV92TWk (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMazCV92TWk)<br /><br />Love, Peace, and Joy to the world! :angel:

				I know it makes me sound like a whackjob, but I believe in the existence of life on other planets, and I don&#039;t find it incredibly unlikely that some of them have visited the earth. That said, why is it that the only people that see these visitors are loonies? I actively look for UFO&#039;s when I&#039;m anywhere dark and can see the sky, hell I even went to Roswell in hopes of catching a glimpse of a flying saucer, and I have seen NOTHING. <br />A lifetime of extraterrestrial disappointment is beginning to give way to spite, and anger.

				I am having a hard time following the plot of the story JourneyIntoWellness is telling.&nbsp; The UFOs are labeled as Galactic Federation Light Ships in the YouTube video.&nbsp; Is the Galactic Federation the good guys, like the Rebel Alliance in Star Wars, or are they more like the Empire?
