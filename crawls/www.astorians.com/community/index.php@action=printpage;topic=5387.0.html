				It was really great to see everyone again at Ginza last night.<br /><br />On the way home, my gf &amp; I were discussing:&nbsp; what does everyone want from the OUT Astoria group?&nbsp; A chance to make new friends?&nbsp; Professional networking?&nbsp; Dating?&nbsp; Something else?

				Social networking, professional networking, not looking for a man (I&#039;ve got one!)<br />How&#039;d people like the food at Ginza?

				I, personally, wasn&#039;t impressed with my dish from Ginza.&nbsp; I only ate about half because it tasted like so much grease.&nbsp; I ordered the Chicken Tempura.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=5387.msg59004.html#msg59004">Quote from: angledge on March 01, 2007, 10:58:25 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">On the way home, my gf &amp; I were discussing:&nbsp; what does everyone want from the OUT Astoria group?&nbsp; A chance to make new friends?&nbsp; Professional networking?&nbsp; Dating?&nbsp; Something else? <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I think I would like to see a bit of all that you mentioned, angledge.&nbsp; It is nice just to meet other people in Astoria.<br /><br />I would also like to see a more variety in the geographical locations.&nbsp; It pretty much seems like everything is either Broadway or 30th Ave.&nbsp; I know that, yes, there are more restaurants at those locations, but it would be nice to see them up at Ditmars, too.&nbsp; I was excited when we were originally set at Watawa because it was closer to home.&nbsp; I know it may be further for others.&nbsp; Too bad they canceled on us.&nbsp; Any other Ditmars locations that would be good?

				We&#039;d love more choices for the Ditmars area, suggest some places that can fit 50 folks and let&#039;s go!<br /><br />I had the Chicken Hibachi and it was a lot of food, fairly tasty too, though I wasn&#039;t so impressed with the soup.&nbsp; The chef was a character, I&#039;m surprised the other tables didn&#039;t grab him.

				Does it have to be a restaurant that can hold such a large group?&nbsp; How about smaller groups, more frequently?&nbsp; It&#039;s not like most people really get a chance to talk to more than 6 or 7 people for any length of time.&nbsp;

				We&#039;re trying to find a way to have more interaction - maybe different courses at different tables?&nbsp; but then we&#039;d need a prix-fixe menu.&nbsp; that&#039;s one of the benefits of the bar night after the dinner, more mixing!

				I am totally okay with a prix-fixe menu.&nbsp; We do that for the Astoria EATS and it is a lot of fun!
