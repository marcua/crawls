				The first day of a heatwave and we already power outtages. My TV went off 4 times this evening, I&#39;m taking a chance just going online, I don&#39;t want a power surge to screw up my computer. My mother told me my father&#39;s oxygen concentration machine can&#39;t work in this brownout, and he needs the machine more during this extreme heat. Con Ed won&#39;t even answer their customer service number, all they say is that some areas have no power due to extreme weather conditions. Even my cable company has better customer service than that.<br /><br />Damn, the lights are dimming again, gotta go.&nbsp; :|

				I haven&#39;t had brownouts up here near Ditmars, but definitely there have been regular brief power drops. My cable modem went out for a while, and, whoops, there it goes again! I wonder if the cable people are getting hit by brownouts? I&#39;m glad I&#39;ve got a UPS for my computer, but it does make it difficult to get anything done on the web if my connection keeps going out... Oh, well.<br /><br />Ahah, the &#39;net&#39;s back!

				I have this little do-dad called a Kill-a-Watt ( http://www.thinkgeek.com/gadgets/electronic/7657/ ) that shows me the current measurements of the electric outlets in my house and how much energy my appliances are using. As most of you know, 115-120 volts is normal output, but as of Monday night/Tuesday morning, it&#39;s running about 95-105 volts. Make sure to turn those computers off or put them on a UPS Batter Backup or Power Conditioner if you don&#39;t want to run into trouble.

				We were definitely experiencing this. Totally sucked, too. My computer kept getting shut down, so I finally gave up and decided to read. Thankfully our air conditioner worked all night long, but going out into the rest of the apt. this morning was like walking into a sauna. I most certainly enjoyed my cool shower - quite refreshing!<br /><br />BTW - Husband did get in touch with Con Ed and they sent somebody over after we were able to confirm with other building residents that they were experiencing trouble as well. They saw that we were running on lower voltage than normal, but as of this morning it doesn&#39;t look like they actually did anything. Everything was still running very slowly and poorly...

				just got off the phone with con-ed and they said they hoped to have the problem fixed by this afternoon. fat chance. right when the day is the hottest they will magically restore all the voltage.<br /><br />after being at about 25% voltage all night the power finally stepped up a notch at 930am on upper ditmars. that means i have enough to power my cable modem and router but little else. certainly no air conditioning.<br /><br />working from home is normally a joy but i&#39;d gladly go to an office today.

				I lost almost all my power last night, the computer and cable modem wouldn&#39;t work at all, same with the AC.&nbsp; I managed to blow a fuse trying to operate the fans, cablebox and the tv at the same time.&nbsp; I hope they get this fixed soon, but I suspect it won&#39;t be until tomorrow at the earliest.<br />I think the power levels must vary by where you are in the neighborhood and maybe by how your building is wired - I hope your power stays strong Eblack!&nbsp; I think your wife will need the AC more than the rest of us.

				Of course there are brownouts, there are millions of people in the five boroughs trying to stay cool. It&#39;s summer in New York, it&#39;s to be expected and unfortunately something you will need to get used to if you continue living in NYC. <br /><br />As annoying as the power outages may be, there are some simple things you can do to stay cool and conserve energy:<br /><br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>Set your thermostat at 78 degrees when you are home and 85 degrees or off when you are away.</li><li>Keep drapes closed and shades drawn. The amount of energy required to cool your home will be considerably less.</li><li>Clothes dryers and dishwashers produce a lot of heat. Use them in the early morning or late evening, not in the heat of the day. </li><li>Use only lights and appliances you really need. Even a basic light bulb can add heat to a room.</li><li>Use a microwave oven instead of a conventional range or oven. This will also reduce cooking time.&nbsp; Consider also using other low-heat kitchen tools such as crock-pots, electric skillets, or toaster ovens.</li><li>Wash full loads of clothes in cold water whenever possible and avoid over-drying.</li><li>Relax in rooms that do not receive direct sunlight or stay on the lowest floor of your home.</li><li>Run you dishwasher at night during off peak hours</li></ul>

				All great advice!<br />I still am surprised that Astoria is getting brown-outs, especially considering we are next to all the power plants, I would have thought we would be less likely to have these sorts of power losses.&nbsp; Doesn&#39;t the fact that we have to live near all these plants have any benefits?

				I&#39;m also surprised we still have brownouts.&nbsp; Lets not kid ourselves.&nbsp; The location of the power plants is strictly so they aren&#39;t in the backyards of Manhattanites.&nbsp; There is no benefit to us that the plants are next door.&nbsp; &nbsp;However, I believe that in 2006 there should be enough power in NYC to meet all our demand.&nbsp; &nbsp;City govt and Con Ed know the rise in population.&nbsp; They also know that incomes are generally increasing and that air conditioners are now used by all, not just the well-off.&nbsp; I hope the city takes some serious steps to increase our power supply going forward.&nbsp; I&#39;d like to see Con Ed digging up streets and installing all new cables if need be this fall.&nbsp; This should never happen again in NY.&nbsp; I have a big cat at home that can&#39;t take the heat so he needs a frigid apt all day.&nbsp; As long as I&#39;m willing to pay for it, I say give me the power!&nbsp; (I guess you can tell that I&#39;m very much a consumer and you won&#39;t catch me conserving anything).&nbsp; &nbsp;:-D

				I just ordered a UPS myself last night. www.upsforless.com seems to have pretty good deals on refurbished ones. I&#39;ve bought from them before and haven&#39;t had any troubles. The units are not &quot;new&quot; but the put new batteries in them. Overall it costs about 40% less to get a used one from them. I saw one for like $50 on buy.com though that looked reasonable. Just a small one.<br /><br />I have my router, cable modem, and VOIP on battery backup and it&#39;s funny to watch it. I&#39;d say that the whole setup is running on battery about 20% of the time all throughout the day right now. My A/C&#39;s are doing the same thing, and my computers only run for about 10 minutes before rebooting. It&#39;s like living in the twilight zone.<br /><br />Not sure if anyone saw the news release &nbsp;(http://www.coned.com/newsroom/news/pr20060718_2.asp)that ConEd put out last night and again this morning. They want us to turn off our A/C&#39;s. Yeah right. I did my duty by going to the library all day long and leaving my house turned off. When I get home I&#39;m cranking it up.

				yeah me too...but apparantly only in my room, my satellite went off, my tv too, my computer restarted and my a/c sounded like it had some bad mexican. turned it off immediately and it came back up. usually in our apt everything goes out at once and is a pain, b/c the switch is in the basement and our landlord won&#39;t let us have the key. <br />so wierd about the fire on 30th ave. when i lived on 30th ave and 45th street, the wires (on the corner where the quays and the laundromat are) caught fire and snapped. the fire dept came and doused it, and eventually they let it burn until it fell. then we had a live wire on the street for a few hours before con ed showed up. no power for almost the entire next day. sounds like they need to work on all those lines over there just in case. but i don&#39;t think those would affect so far as near the park. but i&#39;m no expert.<br /><br />on a separate note, i wonder if this has to do with my dsl. i&#39;ve been having problems since last week, but it was fixed yesterday. then, maybe about an hour before my power flucuated(so spelled that wrong huh?) the modem went out. today when i called tech support to follow up on the technician (who was never sent) the dude tells me i need a new modem. apparantly orange light=f*ed up modem, even though the guy last night new about the light and said it could be fixed with a homw visit. totally different rant about verizon, sorry....<br />so i wonder if there&#39;s a connection. <br />i&#39;m running my AC no matter what con ed says. they can bite me.

				Anyone else experience the delay this evening when there were power failures on the Queens subway lines? The N, R, W, and 7 were at a stand-still for about 45 minutes. Major overcrowding when things started running again.<br />And, wouldn&#39;t you know it, *I* happened to be the person stuck standing next to the one guy on the car who had to have a meltdown over it - some shaved-head thirty-something with a chin merkin. Everyone was packed in like sardines but he had to loudly bitch at me for &quot;crowding him&quot; - as if the whole thing were my idea. Something&nbsp; tells me if I looked like Mr. T or Hulk Hogan instead of a 5&#39;2&quot; woman, he&#39;d have kept his big stupid mouth shut. Sheesh!

				Okay I just got home from the madonna concert and it&#39;s 1:49 am.&nbsp; The Eckard at Ditmars had no ac and very little lights on.&nbsp; All the street lights and walk signs are off.&nbsp; It was so dark!!&nbsp; I&#39;m home and it&#39;s so hot and I want to put on the AC but not sure if I should.&nbsp; But I won&#39;t sleep if I don&#39;t.<br /><br />By the way, Madonna rocked this evening.&nbsp; I&#39;m seeing her again tomorrow.&nbsp; The no AC factor wasn&#39;t as bad as I thought - it&#39;s on low, and as long as you don&#39;t where much and drink lots of water, it&#39;s alright.&nbsp; I only got really hot when I danced too much, but of course it&#39;s hard not to.&nbsp; It&#39;s one big dance party!!&nbsp; She puts on such a good show.

				My story:<br /><br />1. Got stuck at QBP on my way to CSA pickup.<br />2. When leaving CSA pickup, Ditmars announcer informed us (after several minutes of waiting and no trains in sight) that the N was experiencing delays and the W was suspended. I started walking and by amazing luck was crossing the bridge at Astoria Blvd at the exact moment that an N pulled in to the station.<br />3. Got home and the lights were dim. Tried running the a/c, tv and internet. Big mistake. Tv kept going off. Finally took a cold shower by candlelight, made vodka lemonade (again with candlelight), caught up on some phone calls under a groaning, barely functioning a/c. <br /><br />I did manage to get cool enough to sleep. And then there was the thunderstorm. It was actually pretty decent when I went outside this a.m.

				My lights were flickering all night- so we just turned everything off. No a/c, no lights, no computer. We were trying to be considerate. But honestly this morning I almost had a melt down. I walked past the manhole that exploded on Broadway and 30th Street on my way to the subway and there were about 5 Con Ed workers sitting down chatting. It was quite infuriating. I understand it is hot and they are exhausted- but it is hot and miserable for us too! Less coffee breaks and more work. :evil:

				So I was home all day yesterday and by afternoon, was experiencing all the same things as others on this board - very low power and the A/C just wasn&#39;t doing any good - it was 88 degrees inside the apartment! The internet wouldn&#39;t work either, didn&#39;t try the TV. By 5:30pm, I just couldn&#39;t take it anymore. I knew if it continued like that (which from reading all your stories, it sounds like it did!), it would just be downright miserable and so I&#39;m afraid to say ...<br /><br />I defected! To an air-conditioned condo in Jersey City for the night. Ahh, sweet central A/C.<br /><br />Since the TV there was working without a problem, I saw that they were running those news taglines during shows, to tell people in Queens (they listed neighborhoods of Sunnyside, Woodside, others and Astoria) to turn off all &quot;non-essential&quot; electrical items until Con-Edison fixed some problem. Of course seeing that info while in NJ certainly didn&#39;t help me, and if none of your TV&#39;s were working, then you didn&#39;t get it. Not that we needed them to tell us that, since it appeared pretty obvious that there were problems with the electricity. <br /><br />My question is - what do they consider &quot;non-essential&quot;??

				Con Ed Continutes to Urge Customers <br />in Northwest Queens to <br />Reduce their Use of Electricity<br /><br />While Con Edison crews worked through the night to stabilize the electric grid in Northwest Queens, the company continues to urge all customers in the Long Island City, Sunnyside, Woodside, Hunters Point and Astoria neighborhoods of Queens to discontinue their use of non-essential electrical appliances and equipment until problems on electrical cables can be resolved. The utility is experiencing difficulties in this area and customer cooperation will help ensure uninterrupted electric service.<br /><br />The affected area is bounded by the East River on the west and north, the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway on the east and Newtown Creek on the south.<br /><br />Company crews continue to rectify the problem. Con Edison has asked customers in the affected areas not to use appliances such as washers, dryers, air conditioners and other energy-intensive equipment and to turn off lights and televisions when not needed until the feeder cable problems are resolved.<br /><br />The cable problems in the northwest Queens have no effect on the rest of the Con Edison system. Con Edison will provide updates to affected customers both directly and through the media as the situation warrants. The company is in constant communication with the New York City Office of Emergency Management.<br />

				So I just got back home from my defection to Jersey City (I would have stayed for the central A/C but have an event in Astoria tonight to attend) and was greeted by my neighbor telling me things have gotten worse, and that there was an explosion up on Ditmars, and that all the stores around there - including the supermarkets - are closed! She was all gloom and doom, saying that the power is going to go out tonight completely and then we&#39;re going to have another black-out like a couple years ago.<br /><br />However, I got home and found my A/C is working, perhaps not at its full capacity but it&#39;s blowing cool air which is better than yesterday. Internet is down again (thank goodness for neighbor&#39;s unsecured WiFi!).<br /><br />But is this true - that stores and supermarkets are closed around Ditmars? And any word on an explosion around there?

				Another bathroom tip:<br /><br />Before god invented air-conditioning, people would put blocks of ice in front of fans to get cool air circulating. So if you&#39;re lucky enough to have a window in your bathroom, leave it open and let the air blow over the water in the tub. Your kitty will thank you.

				I love it. Some posts ago, someone posted an advisory from ConEd asking that we don&#39;t run our ACs so as to help with the speed of recovery. Three or four posts later, someone is posting that they just got home and turned on the AC...and it works!<br /><br />While I&#39;m as mad as the next person at ConEd, I am still planning on following their instructions.<br />While I may be able to eek out a bit of AC, it would be causing extra stress on an already heavily stressed system.<br /><br />I hope the little trickle of air you got from your AC is worth my daughters having no power yet again tonight, you selfish prick.

				On that same note, I remember when I lived in Brooklyn and there was some big snow storm (not THE big snow storm, but one of &#39;em) and everyone went on tv and tooted their horn about how everything was up and running fine, and it was a total mess out where I was living. No train service at all, busses were packed, people were pounding on the doors as we drove past bus stops. It was crazy<br /><br />I think things like this are more agonizing when it&#39;s just one small(ish) pod of people affected and no one else is having to deal with it.

The utility is experiencing equipment problems in this area and customer cooperation will help ensure uninterrupted electric service.

				FYI, I hunted around online and found some battery-powered fans on amazon for $19.99 that seemed to get good reviews (they run on &quot;D&quot; batteries). Ordered two. They might not arrive until after this fiasco is over, but I will be prepared if the AC goes out during a heat spell again.<br /><br />Best of luck out there, everyone.

				Someone just told me that ConEd announced on 101WINS that this situation should be expected to last until Monday. I don&#39;t know how reliable that info is (that station is so headline oriented, I always feel like there are crucial details I&#39;m not getting), but there might be a need for the ice they&#39;re passing out (now they&#39;re saying they&#39;re bringing more ice to hand out on both Ditmars and Steinway). <br /><br />An earlier post included this link to the food reimbursement form, and I think it bears repeating here:<br /><br />https://m020-w5.coned.com/lawclaims/images/Residential.pdf

				We can thank Uncle Ron for this little situation with regards to deregulation.&nbsp; This is a perfect example of deregulation gone wrong.&nbsp; In essence, what has happened is other companies can sell power, but Con Ed still owns and opperates all the infrastructure.&nbsp; How is this possible?&nbsp; So it doesn&#39;t matter who you buy electricity from, some of the dollars you pay for electric still ends up with <span class="bbc_u">CON</span> Ed.

				I agree that it is important to always remember that customer service representatives are there to help you and answer questions (while also towing their company line) but that they are people too - they&#39;re certainly not the policymakers who have allowed these problems to occur.&nbsp; If we could get the head of ConEd or some of their board members on the phone, then I think some anger would be in order.<br />I&#39;ve never understood what people think they are achieving by being mean to customer service reps.&nbsp; It&#39;s just unkind and unnecessary.

				Check out this blurb! So interesting...notice how it came from a publication dated July 11, 2006!! For the whole article go to: http://www.wnyc.org/news/articles/62003 ... These guys KNEW this was going to happen!!<br /><br /><br /><strong>The Astoria Generation Station is facing this exact dilemma. It already has approval to replace its old boilers with new combined-cycle gas turbines like those at Ravenswood. These would increase output while also being more efficient. But the 1 point 5 billion dollar cost is unaffordable says Liam Baker, who manages Regulatory Affairs for the plant’s owner, US Power Generating Company.</strong>

				As usual, all the politicians try to get in the act and put a blame on everything else. &nbsp;Did any one of them drive around the neighborhood and see what was going on. &nbsp;On Northern Blvd and 48 Street (an extremely busy intersection with shopping and a bus makes a turn) the traffic lights were out until last night. &nbsp;Periodically a police car would pull over, drink their coffee (This is the truth) and watch the traffic. &nbsp;Not one got out to direct the traffic. &nbsp;Finally they sent over the auxiliary cops to stand there. Is this pathetic or what. &nbsp;Now all the politicians blame Con Ed for not getting the word out. &nbsp;Not one politician came to my block either to tell people that if they received limited power not to turn on air conditioners. &nbsp;So many folks thought this was it. &nbsp;I would say there was a major breakdown of communication across the board. &nbsp;<br />Just to clarify one thing, the con ed worker did not tell the people to have a cookout. &nbsp;There was a woman earlier on the radio who was interviewed and she said on her block people got together to have &nbsp;a cookout with all their meat and she said it was like a block party. &nbsp;After that, I heard a con ed spokesperson say what positive attitude the woman had and ti keep spirits up more people should do that. &nbsp;I am sure with sound bites, the whole story got clipped to just the con ed worker.<br />

				Also - it&#39;s too simplistic to think that the power outages are directly caused by new construction and illegal conversions (though I&#39;m sure increasing the number of people who need and are using electrical power has further stretched and already overextended system).&nbsp; If new development was directly tied into these power outages, why is it only Astoria and Western Queens that&#39;s being affected?&nbsp; There is a lot more building and illegal conversions going on further East, Flushing and Elmhurst jump to mind immediately, and Manhattan has been haywire with new construction, but doesn&#39;t seem to have had any power outages this go round.

Taking the easy road by attacking the utility is useless. <br /><br />The facts clearly point to booming development. The politicians clearly recieve a lot of money from developers. As to illegal conversions, Queens has 10 times more, thats right, 10 times more than any other borough.<br /><br />They all should share in the blame.<br /><br />Gleason and Gatorboy were right.

				oh jeeeeeeeeeez would you stop with the over-development people. Its seriously like a broken record. Yes, overdevelopment leads to problems, but if Queens West has been booming since the 90s, ConEd has had plenty of time to make the proper upgrades/adjustments. <br /><br />I&#39;m really starting to think that there should just be www.overdevelopedqueenswest.com or something.<br /><br />This board is getting to be not so fun as I have to continuously weed through rants about overdevelopment - especially when at least one of the people ranting lives in one of the high-rises on the waterfront.

				I&#39;m curious about proximate causes, regardless of ultimate causes. The Westchester outages seem to have been the result of the storm that followed the two days of hot weather. Trees knocked into powerlines, that sort of thing, routine for power companies, and yes, it can take a long time to reconstruct a power grid. <br /><br />But down here, it seems like the power problems started before the storm, and that they were due to insufficient supply of power. And then, when usage became more than the system could handle, instead of responsibly setting up rolling blackouts, ConEd just said &quot;please stop running your ACs&quot; and watched as the feeder cables burst into flames.&nbsp; :roll: Has anyone heard whether the storm itself in any way contributed to the problems here in Queens?

				Monday morning I had only 3 dress shirts ironed for work this week, and I ended up going to work Thursday in a wrinkled shirt. My iron wouldn&#39;t heat up in this brownout/powerouttage. MY refrigerator was out since Tuesday, everything but the sodas are garbage now. Event he water heater didn&#39;t work, took a very cold shower yeaterday. The power went out completely 1:00pm Thursday, and didn&#39;t come back on until 9:00pm. Luckily I bought my dinner in the city and ate it by candlelight in my home. Only half the house had electric last night, but this morning it seems to all be back, but I;m not sure if it&#39;s 100% yet, the lights still seem a bit dim. <br /><br />About 4-5 years ago there were electrical fires on 28th Avenue , and several manhole covers exploded. Since then my neighborhood had continous problems with brownouts, not just in summer but all seasons. I&#39;d come home from work and the light would be dim and the refrigeration wouldn&#39;; cool properly. I had called Con Ed several times, and I was told at least twice that I should be happy that I had any power. &nbsp;:x<br /><br />Recently I had an electrician check the power source into my home, and he said it&#39;s lower than what it should be and that it fluctuates from too low to too high. I hope they have changed the feeder cables now, since that may help solve the chronic brownout problems.

				I have to agree that I see this as more than just a supply/demand issue (more units, more development and less infrastructure.) I see this as ConEd not doing their job in keeping infrastructure up to date no matter what the circumstances are.<br /><br />If you for example even look at the electric lines coming to my apartment they are REALLY OLD. One of the cables is actually peeling away from the building.<br /><br />Even if this does boil down to a simple supply/demand issue, as others have pointed out development and unit conversions don&#39;t happen overnight. I&#39;ve been dealing with &quot;brown&quot; power ever since I moved here, it was only a matter of time before something blew up. Anyone with a pocket electric meter can see that infrastructure needs to be upgraded.<br /><br />A key problem I think is that ConEd just doesn&#39;t want to spend the money to put in new infrastructure. They&#39;d rather milk existing assets until they blow up in order to put off the cost of upgrading. Think of it, if you can get a piece of equipment that&#39;s rated for 10 years of use to run for 15-20 you&#39;ve just cut your per-year cost for equipment replacement by 50% easy. I highly doubt though they expected the problem to be this big.<br /><br />So sure, development (demand) could be a part of the picture. But any reasonable person I think could see this coming for the last 5 years, why couldn&#39;t ConEd? This IS the fault of planners - or maybe, as I&#39;m arguing this was the plan all along. Slightly more risky (because it can blow up in your face as this has done), but it&#39;s possible to save a lot of money if failures don&#39;t happen all at once. If indeed this is the case, makes sense why ConEd is so quiet about what went wrong, and when it will be fixed. Chances are they know people may be pretty upset when they find out we&#39;re getting power from 40 year old equipment.<br /><br />Just a thought.

				From the Times-Ledger:<br /><br />&nbsp;Astoria power outage may last through weekend<br />By:Nathan Duke<br />07/20/2006<br />email this storyEmail to a friendpost a commentPost a Commentprinter friendlyPrinter-friendly<br />Elected officials said the power outage that began Monday in Astoria and other parts of western Queens could last through the weekend and slammed Con Edison&#39;s response to the blackouts at a press conference Thursday.<br /><br /><br />State Sen. George Onorato (D-Long Island City), State Assembly Members Michael Gianaris (D-Astoria), Catherine Nolan (D-Ridgewood) and Marge Markey (D-Maspeth) and City Council Members Peter Vallone Jr. (D-Astoria) and Eric Gioia (D-Sunnyside) spoke to a rowdy group of Astoria residents on 31st Street at Ditmars Boulevard and called on Mayor Michael Bloomberg to step in and help the neighborhood. Gianaris said many residents have been without power for three days and that a number of area senior citizens are without adequate air conditioning, groceries and water. Officials slammed Con Edison&#39;s response to the blackout.<br />&quot;Con Edison has been charged with one job and they are doing a bad job of it,&quot; Vallone said. &quot;People in this neighborhood want to storm into Con Edison with pitchforks. This is worse than the blackout a few years ago.&quot;<br />The blackouts began Monday following temperatures reaching over 100 degrees and thunderstorms that evening. Numerous Con Edison trucks lined the streets of Astoria Thursday as Con Ed workers attempted to restore overstressed power cables, many of which had caught on fire and melted. A number of stores along Ditmars Boulevard were closed due to the lack of electricity.<br /><br />Advertisement<br />Reach reporter Nathan Duke by email at news@timesledger.com or by phone at 718-229-0300, Ext. 156.

				how is it possible that things are getting WORSE? <br /><br />for the last couple of days, we&#39;ve had limited power in our bedroom, enough to keep a fan spitting out the faintest breeze, and a little bit of light from a small halogen lamp. Now my partner tells me that we lost that as well. AND one of the workers outside told him that we&#39;ll probably be the last section of the neighborhood to receive power. How much more can ConEd f___ things up? <br /><br />That they&#39;re also putting a cap on how much reimbursement I can receive for spoiled food (no, we don&#39;t keep the receipts laying around the house) is infuriating.

				I just received a call back (finally) from a Con Ed supervisor.&nbsp; He said the Ditmars section should be receiving power by the end of the day as crews are focusing on that area today.<br /><br />The situation occured because a couple feeder cables died on Monday.&nbsp; The system is set up to transfer the power from the broken feeders to the other cables.&nbsp; The load was too much on the additional feeders, causing the situation to escalate.&nbsp; I&#39;m certainly no expert on the situation, but I&#39;m no dummy either.&nbsp; It seems clear that the smart decision would have been, as Harlan suggested, to have rolling blackouts, or shut the system down temporarily to fix the original feeders, thus avoiding the over stressing on the additional lines.&nbsp; Therefore, I put this squarely on the shoulders of Con Ed, and blame their lack on foresite on this situation.

				I&#39;m on Steinway just past Ditmars, and we&#39;ve been without power since Tuesday - and Monday was quasi-power. Now the lights will go on, barely, but nothing else is working - hot water, fridge, etc. I live on the 3rd floor of a 2 family, so that means it&#39;s an oven in there with no circulating air.&nbsp; :x Am I disloyal for staying with a friend in Manhattan with my two cats? <br /><br />I&#39;m not upset about 40-year-old equipment, just that they didn&#39;t update any of it in the interim. We have ConEd trucks at 21st Ave and Steinway all the time, there&#39;s always something wrong. And sometimes, the air is so stank... so clearly, they&#39;ve known what was up for a long time and they&#39;ve done NOTHING. <br /><br />I believe it&#39;s a combination of factors - old, poorly maintained equipment, higher levels of occupancy, and MUCH more usage of high drawing electronics like A/C&#39;s - remember, 50 years ago, hardly anyone had this stuff.

				Our landlord (31st St and 21st Avenue) said he just talked to ConEd for a more precise estimate due to the fact that our (large) building has a number of older tenants in need of medical attention. They told him SUNDAY at the earliest. Why is it we&#39;re getting different information from every person we talk to? Earlier, someone told us Monday, then I was told by a ConEd rep on the phone that it would be sometime today. This is outrageous. And since my partner works freelance, every day costs big bucks. To be given contradictory information at ever turn seems unacceptable. Of course, the press conference was yesterday, so I suppose no one sees a need to supply any further useful information. One way or another it&#39;ll be solved by Monday, and it&#39;s not as if any further media events like that will happen. <br /><br />As for the estimates based on phone calls--I can&#39;t imagine who would think it a good idea to even admit to such stupidity.

				I personally stopped believing anything Con-Edison said when they said only 2500 people didn&#39;t have power, when anyone with half a brain could see it was a lot more than that.&nbsp; They say not to run appliances, when it&#39;s becoming clear that wasn&#39;t the main thing that brought these problems about in the first place (distribution, not supply).&nbsp; They&#39;re currnetly fixing distribution to certain households, and giving full power to others- how is people who already have the power running their appliances disrupting their repair efforts?&nbsp; I doubt it is.&nbsp; So before we all jump all over each other, let&#39;s remember where we should really be directing our anger- Con-Edison.

				Well, I got something loud and long that makes people yell... :mrgreen:<br /><br />I tend to agree with Gleason though here, I don&#39;t think class action suit against ConEd and ConEd only would be terribly successful, and even if (after a long, drawn out process) there was a victory I don&#39;t think it would be terribly significant in terms of a) monetary compensation or b) the power infrastructure being fixed so that this never happens again.<br /><br />Also, I doubt the commitment to fighting this and tracking down the responsible parties once the power goes back on.&nbsp; Speaking for myself, I&#39;m pissed off and will do anything to fight right now - but once I&#39;m fat and happy on electricity and hot water again - my already-limited leisure time will get harder and harder to devote to something as frustrating and wheel-spinning as fighting the man.

				Gleason: This is not about overdevelopment. &nbsp;Ditmars is one of the most underdeveloped areas in the five boroughs. &nbsp;Most houses are running on 60 amps which is really nothing. &nbsp;The demand hasn&#39;t increased significantly over last year. &nbsp;Con Ed itself has admitted that this is not a supply problem (call their spokesman if you don&#39;t believe me), but an equipment problem. &nbsp;Less development wouldn&#39;t have fixed the infrastructure (in fact, new development probably would have required certain upgrades to the infrastructure, and in this case, might have helped.)<br /><br />As to questions about a class action lawsuit -- the hard part here is proving damages. &nbsp;How have Astorians been actually hurt in the pocketbook (apart from rotting food, which ConEd does pay for)? That&#39;s what we&#39;d have to figure out to file a class action suit.

				Its like old wiring. A house built for a load of 1950s electricity needs a new upgrade. Same with a community. <br /><br />Funny how all the politicians focus their attention on the new development. Queens West is ok. Maybe some of that effort could have gone into older parts of our community.<br /><br />Yes Ditmars was hurt because the 10 story buildings next door on 21st Street (thank you HANAC!)<br /><br />The point here is that with this land rush of overdevelopment (unlike 90% of Queens that is down zoning) no one knows how many people live in our community. The politicians themselves admitted this when the census did a mini-recount in 2004. <br /><br />They said the numbers may have been &#39;substantially undercounted&#39; at that time. <br /><br />So what do they do? Of course, being the local talent, they INCREASE the zoning for Queens Plaza, Dutch Kills, DROOL over 20-30-40 towers on the waterfront, and plan to SHOEHORN 10-15 story barracks on low scale blocks. <br /><br />Who wants to run a utility in that kind of envirnment?<br /><br />So, where is the big surprise? People have been posting about overdevelpment on this board and elsewhere for months. <br /><br />And this, good people, is just the beginning...
