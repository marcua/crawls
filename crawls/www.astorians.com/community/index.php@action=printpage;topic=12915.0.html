				This is not an ad.&nbsp; In no way am I affiliated with the rink.&nbsp; I&#039;m just spreading the news.<br /><br />Just got an e-mail from the director of Hockey @ the Ice Pavilion (I&#039;ve known him for a while...really nice guy).&nbsp; Innagural <strong>Adult</strong> hockey tournament is going to start next week (the little leagues will probably start sometime later).&nbsp; If you want in on a team, there will be two &quot;evaluation&quot; (i.e. - tryout) sessions.&nbsp; The first one is this Thursday - Nov 6th - at 8:30.&nbsp; The second is next Tuesday - Nov 11 - at 7 p.m.<br /><br />As you can imagine, you have to supply your own gear.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if they have a pro shop on site, so if you do go, I suggest you get your skates sharpened prior to.&nbsp; Insofar as I can tell, all levels are invited.&nbsp; For those of you who don&#039;t know, they basically make you do drills and assess which level you&#039;re best suited to play.&nbsp; No one wants to see someone get hurt if they&#039;re playing over thier head.<br /><br />I will most likely be there on Thursday between the pipes and protecting the twine...depending on how the knee holds up.<br /><br />I&#039;ll laugh if I show up and anyone tries to go high glove side on me.&nbsp; Unless you have a cannon, good luck with that.<br /><br />http://cityice.pucksystems.com/

				Odd question...never heard of anyone ever paying to watch a non-professional hockey game (unless you&#039;re talking about international junior teams.&nbsp; But to me, those kids are basically semi-pro).&nbsp; That&#039;s like someone paying to see a beer-league softball game.&nbsp; <br /><br />There usually isn&#039;t anyone in the stands at &quot;beer league&quot; games other than family, friends and &quot;significant others&quot;.&nbsp; But if you&#039;re inclined to just check it out, I don&#039;t think there would be any problems.<br /><br />Truth be told though...I&#039;ve never been to the rink.&nbsp; So I don&#039;t even know if there are stands available.&nbsp; But hey, a lot of people stand up and watch little league games.&nbsp; Guess it would be ok to stand behind the glass.&nbsp; Of course, you do so at your own risk.&nbsp; This is new plexi-glass.&nbsp; They haven&#039;t been tested yet.<br /><br />My suggestion...bring a warm jacket and a thermos of hot chocolate.&nbsp; It is a huge sheet of ice out there after all.

				I figured somebody&#039;s gotta pay for ice time, and admission would be charged to help cover that.&nbsp;

				When a team gives up two shorthanded goals in the third period to a couple of third line guys who would probably fourth line guys on any other team, and can&#039;t beat the backup goaltender...yeah, &quot;GO TEAM GO!!!&quot;<br /><br />That makes about as much sense as your avatar.

				this is for a house league or a tournament? you said tournament, but i get the feeling it&#039;s a house league.<br /><br />do they have open hockey times?<br /><br />i&#039;m supposed to stay off the ice until at least December b/c of shoulder surgery. but i&#039;ve got the itch to skate a bit and test it out ;)

				Just got word that the evaluation session for tonight (the 6th) is <strong>cancelled</strong>.&nbsp; Same goes for the session on Monday.&nbsp; No new dates have been provided yet.<br /><br />Construction delays, you gotta love them (NOT).

				Well, they had some open hockey this weekend and I got an invitation, so I checked out the new rink in our neighborhood and broke in a new sheet of ice.<br /><br />The facility is nice, but minimal.&nbsp; I must say, it was also a little unusual to take an elevator from the dressing room to the actual rink.&nbsp; It&#039;s also a little strange playing in what looks like a tiny airplane hanger.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to post pics and other details in a later review, which I&#039;ll post under a seperate thread.&nbsp; If the original tournament comes up again, I&#039;ll post information about that on this thread again.&nbsp;
