				Not take-out, as I&#39;m very happy with Fresca Tortilla. Even the plain tortillas are amazing. <br /><br />But for sit-down, decent atmosphere, any recommendations? I suppose Taco Mexicano is the only game in town? (at least on this side o&#39; town.)

				Joey&#39;s right. Tacos Mexico on 38th just down from Broadway is the best. I&#39;m originally from Southern California and although that usually doesnt make me privy to much around here, it does mean that I know my comidas mexicanas. And this place is the best. They even have a jukebox and telenovelas playing on the tvs in the afternoon. Pool table complete with local sharks in the adjoining room (full service bar too)!!<br />Not only are the tacos authentic (none of that flour tortilla-Taco Bell-style crap) but the salsas are homemade and the guacamole actually has real avocados (revolutionary). The huaraches and the sopes are great to share (big plates!) and the tostadas are so authentic you wouldn&#39;t recognize them as the deep-fried monsters Americans are used to. Order up a Pacific Claro with your torta (what the locals tend to get-- great bread!) and you&#39;re set. If you&#39;re in the know, you&#39;ll also get a traditional horchata (spiced rice milk) for the road!<br />

				Annie, I appreciate your insightful review.&nbsp; I, too, lived in Southern California (Ventura and LA areas) for quite some time, as well as in NorCal in Berkeley.&nbsp; When you say it is authentic, in which way is it authentic:<br /><br />greazy taco truck<br />taqueria in East LA <br />taqueria in Encino <br />food your Mexican friend&#39;s mom makes<br /><br />LOVE THE HORCHATA!&nbsp; Is it sweet and cinnamony?&nbsp; Do they also have aguas frescas?<br />

				Horchata: totally sweet and cinammony! A little nutmeggy too but that might just be in my head. <br />I think Tacos Mexico is authentic in terms of stuff you can find on the Mission in SF, or alternatively at the street festivals off Olivera Street in LA (not the ones actually ON Olivera since they&#39;re no better than La Salsa)<br />But I digress. I reccommend the Tacos Mexico NACHOS. Get the Tejanos style. Its got carne asada and crema and tons and tons of fresh cilantro.<br />And of course you may know this (but many new yorkers do not) but real mexican food doesnt actually include shredded orange &quot;cheddar&quot; cheese on everything... the beloved nachos come with cotijo. If only they roasted corn!!<br />Oh-- and they also have aguas frescas (not a huge selection)... dont forget the tamarindo flavored Jarritos!<br /><br />Incidentally: does anyone know if that place &quot;Locale&quot; on 34th Ave and 33rd Street (near the old Tupelo) is going to be anything??<br /><br />buenas suerte, compadres!<br /><br />

				Can you get a California-style burrito a la Pancho Villa in the Mission?<br /><br />Your description of the food at this place sounds really good, annie!&nbsp; I will check it out soon.<br /><br />Yum, Jarritos!&nbsp; Good news about the aguas frescas and horchata (one of my all time favorite drinks in the world).

				Well, megc, I must say that although the burritos there are kickass they are not necessarily pancho-villa-esque. But kudos for knowing that!! I feel so comforted by a fellow californian&#39;s food references. To talk shop: the Tacos Mexico burritos are on-target because they have the rice and beans on the INSIDE (as opposed to on the side); there is no cheap cheddarella cheese and refried bean junk; and the tortilla is nice and chargrilled on the outside. Ready to eat with hands (not requiring fork and knife nonsense)... BUT its still not the same. There&#39;s not enough pico de gallo oftentimes. And the asado is really not that grilled (maybe more on a griddle than on a BBQ, for example) They give you little containers of guac and crema on the side. <br /><br />Does that help?

				I have to go back to Mexico.&nbsp; Like, now.&nbsp; (regular to Baja.)<br /><br />It&#39;s not a restaurant, but Trade Fair on Ditmars between 37th and 38th sells cotija, as well as queso blanco and crema mexicana.&nbsp; That would give you a start at home, at least. :yum: (&lt;-- we need that smilie)

				megc! coincidentally (and unfortunately for the proposed group event) I&#39;ll be in LA this weekend! I&#39;m returning to my MotherState to see my family and soak in some wintertime sun on the beach... You can be sure that I&#39;ll bring back some authentic fish tacos (they&#39;re only right if they have fresh shredded cabbage, as you know) for you guys-- along with some bunuelos, yeah? <br />Well in an attempt to establish a brief glossary for those who asked:<br /><br />Authentic Mexican Food Items for the New Yorker<br /><br />1) sopes = grilled corn tortillas served open-face with pinto beans, cotijo (crumbly white cheese), lettuce, pico de gallo and grilled meat of your choice piled high.

Garnished with radishes (a oaxaca favorite). <br />3) nopales = cactus leaves (great in the aformentioned pozole!)... often times grilled. Sometimes has the texture of okra. No needles, don&#39;t worry!<br />3) huaraches = thick &quot;cradles&quot; of masa (corn meal dough) filled with the usual suspects, and sometimes freshly shredded cabbage... the shape of the little corn meal cradle resembles the shoe&nbsp; and so the &quot;huarache&quot; sandal. <br />4) tortas = mexican sandwich (the chorizo at Tacos Mexico is the BEST!) with all the usual food groups including mayo or chipotle sauce oftentimes. The bread is key here: they should use a roll that&#39;s not too dense and slightly sweet (like a fluffly pan de leche)<br />5) bunuelos = deep fried tortilla triangles (they puff up) sprinkled with cimmamon and sugar.
