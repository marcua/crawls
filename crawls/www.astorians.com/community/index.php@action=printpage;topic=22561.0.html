				I don&#039;t see why would they open right across the street from Bare Burger. I see lots of these OTB places still empty in prime retail areas. I wonder why, and who owes them anyway, the state?

				Sounds good.&nbsp; There&#039;s another sports bar right across the street.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s called Ditmars Station

				That&#039;s good news.&nbsp; There isn&#039;t really a heck of a lot of basic kind of bars or pubs in the Ditmars area.&nbsp; In fact, there are practically none other than McCann&#039;s and Ditmars Station.&nbsp; And these guys can even play up the old use of the building with some horse racing memorablia.&nbsp; It&#039;s also a good sized space.&nbsp; So it could be roomy like Canz near Steinway.&nbsp; I hope they renovate and open soon.

There&#039;s also a homeless encampment that I&#039;ve seen in the back of that parking lot. I find that odd since there was huge media coverage of how Vallone put up a camera back there. Seems like that was more of a move to look good in the papers as a reaction to a highly publicized bad incident back there. I guess that was just done to make it look as if Vallone saved the day.
