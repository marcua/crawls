			hello Astorians,<br />I am a 25 year old female looking for a studio apartment starting November 1st. My price range is between $800-950. I&#39;m really interested in checking out the Ditmars side of Astoria, or possibly a bit below that. I currently live on the Upper West Side and will have been living in the city for 2 years come November. I have a great relationship with my current landlord and I&#39;d describe myself as a quiet and respectful tenant, who pays rent every month. Anyway, if anyone can help me out or give me ideas (or even better, if you know of any good leads or actual apartments I can look at), then please reply and I&#39;d be very happy to hear from you! Thank you!<br />CM

			That depends. Somethimes with private home owners, someone knows someone and the apartment never goes on the market. That&#39;s how a friend of mine landed a one bedroom apartment on the 2nd floor of a 2 family house in the old Italian part Williamsburg three months before she actually moved in... her aunt knew the landlord.<br />maybe the same thing could happen in some of the 2 or 3 family homes up by the Ditmars area???
