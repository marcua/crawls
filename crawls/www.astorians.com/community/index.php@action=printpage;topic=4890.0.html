				I&#39;m curious as to where in Astoria everyone lives.&nbsp; Are there more people on the board from the Ditmars area, from Central Astoria, from Southern Astoria, are there more from East of the elevated tracks or closer to the river.&nbsp; Just curious!&nbsp; I know people have stated where they&#39;re living in other threads, but I&#39;d be interested in seeing a thread about where we are in our own community.<br /><br />I&#39;m at 34th Street and Broadway myself.

				31st Avenue &amp; 42nd Street. :rock:<br />The day I came to first look at this apartment, I really had no idea where I was. I literally had walked from the Broadway N/W stop all the way around on Northern Blvd. back up to 42nd street and after&nbsp; &nbsp;running out of quarters, two and half hours and finally finding an ATM, I was on the phone giving my partner the correct directions on how to get here from the UWS.

I do feel bad for them as they just have not been pulling them in but as my partner and I were discussing (he may joining the board soon ::yay::) we think it would have been better if it was a different cuisine that had gone in that location. OTOH, it is a wierd spot on the whole for a restaurant, but I am rambling on here as this is not the restaurant thread so in conclusion I wish them the best of luck! AND SCENE!!! :wink:

				My first place was on 31st street and 24th ave ( i lucked up, with the beergarden and the park so close)... i always felt that the north/south border was Astoria Blvd itself. Not that its even distance wise, just because mentally walking over the highway always felt like you in a different area; either direction. Plus the ditmars area (where I am now) does feel very different than Broadway or 30th Ave. <br /><br />31st Ave is lovely though. That was our #1 area to move to but there was nothing we liked available at the time.<br /><br />I will say being in the 40&#39;s is also a very different Astoria experience. Walking down Steinway to the R in the morning was not fun. (garbage).<br /><br />

				A lot of us South of Broadway have Astoria addresses and are definitely a part of Astoria.&nbsp; I think LIC starts down by Northern Boulevard - and would be over closer to the river.&nbsp; Dutch Kills, along 36th Avenue is part of the Astoria Civic Association, so I think Astoria goes further South.

				I agree that the LIC/Astoria border &quot;feels&quot; more like Northern Boulevard.&nbsp; As a 35th Avenue dweller, I can easily walk to Ditmars and never feel like I&#39;m crossing neighborhoods, but crossing Northern Boulevard is just a huge boundary.&nbsp; <br /><br />Not that I&#39;m the authority on this by any means, but I kind of think of the 7 train as &quot;Long Island City&quot; and the N/W train as &quot;Astoria&quot;.&nbsp; Culturally, those areas are just completely different, and 35th/36th Ave are still consistent with the layout and feel of Astoria to me, whereas the stuff off the 7 train isn&#39;t.<br /><br />Oh yeah, I consider myself a &quot;South Astorian&quot;!

				Currently and hopefully for the rest of my life I&#039;m at Crescent Street and 23rd Avenue.&nbsp; I grew up on 24th Street and 21st Avenue and used to live on 28th Street between 33rd and 34th Avenue.&nbsp; While I&#039;ve loved every area I&#039;ve ever lived in, I&#039;d have to say the 28th street location was the best.&nbsp; You couldn&#039;t beat being right around the corner from Broadway.&nbsp;

				ditmars and 28th street for 32 yrs .&nbsp; i saw recently in some queens real estate magazine that they were ranking the top most wanted streets in astoria , and the streets were..............................&nbsp; 42st and ditmars&nbsp; &nbsp;.......46th and ditmars&nbsp; and believe it or not , yup , i kid u not ....28th and ditmars .&nbsp; ill try to find out the name of this magazine hopefully .&nbsp; by the way the rankings were based on most asked for blocks by renters and future home owners&nbsp; as well as strategic&nbsp; areas close to the train ,trees and green,&nbsp; less amount of traffic and noise as well as size of the houses .&nbsp; being on a hill was also a huge plus .&nbsp; &nbsp;by the way 28th and ditmars does have some of the largest homes in astoria .

				In the mid-90s, the USPS tried to do away with neighbourhood names and rezone Queens into four mailing zones -- Long Island City (111-- zips), Flushing (113-- zips), Jamaica (114-- zips) and Far Rockaway (116-- zips).&nbsp; (Full article here (http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9507E3DE113DF930A1575BC0A96E958260).)&nbsp; This is why even the post office by Ditmars says Long Island City (http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=31st+St+%26+Ditmars+Blvd,+astoria,+ny&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=37.546691,67.851563&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=40.775699,-73.912228&amp;spn=0.002194,0.004141&amp;t=h&amp;z=18&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=40.774648,-73.91253&amp;panoid=YYSUdenclOQzX0tb4AO--g&amp;cbp=1,310.85606656018587,,1,-0.06757969974822794).<br /><br />They eventually relented, but I&#039;ve occasionally been informed when I try to order something online that 11105 comes up only as Long Island City.

				when I try to order something online that 11105 comes up only as Long Island City.<br />We actually do live in Long Island City.&nbsp; LIC was an actual city before the consolidation of the five boroughs (as we know them today) into our &quot;New York City&quot; The same way before 1898 ( the year we became NYC) Brooklyn was a city as well. Old habits die hard. When i was younger, you would not use as your return address &quot;Astoria, NY&quot; You would use -&quot;Long Island City, New York&quot;&nbsp; I, to this day sometimes have&nbsp; documents mailed to my house addressed as LIC, NY. People(not the Government) over time have shortened The &quot;L.I.C.&quot; Territory to just the area around Jackson Ave. Which was the &quot;capital&quot; of LIC, not the whole. Calling the whole area &quot;Astoria&quot; is just a result of common slang. LIC was / IS the whole area which is commonly known as &quot;Astoria&quot;. Long Island City included (includes)the &quot;neighborhoods&quot; of Ravenswood, Astoria, Steinway, Ditmars, Etc.. No matter what the people who live here choose to call the neighberhood(Myself included), we are still Long Island City, until the U.S. Post office decides differently!! lol !

				I live on 34th St between 30th and 31st Ave. The area is cool but I used to live at 33rd and Ditmars and preferred it there. Ditmars is not as noisy and still has a lot to do. Running to the park is easier too! Hope to move back soon.

				Please, I would like to kindly ask for some help here. I am moving to the city from Jersey (before that I lived in upstate NY for 4 years but I am originally from Venezuela --go figure) and I am seriously considering Astoria as my best option. First at all, because I really like it and secondly because it&#039;s cheaper than many other places.<br />However, the times I have been in Astoria I have felt a little lost. I never get what street is north which one is south. The fact that they are many streets and avenues with the same numbers crossing each other confuses me. Besides the fact, of course, that I have no sense of orientation at all. Needless to say, I am still trying to figure it out where is each area (south, central, north astoria) while also trying to get an idea of what are the differences between each area, and what it means to live in one or another.<br />That said, I would like to get some word of advise as to which area is best, or more recommendable, which area I should avoid, what area has more restaurants, shops, etc, what area is a little more quiet, etc.<br />Can anyone help me, please? I am falling desperately victim of my own ignorance.<br /><br />Thank you all in advance!<br />Best,<br />Camuri :wink:
