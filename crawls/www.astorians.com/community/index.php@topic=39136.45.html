								<div class="inner" id="msg_255712">I&#039;m not an Astoria original, but have been here for almost 6 years, so feel I can make a statement. <br /><br /><br />I definitely notice a difference; more white young people, baby strollers, hipster beards, and trendy food places. I also still see the diversity of cultures as well, thank god. I also still see a butchers and fish markets too, and hope that stays.<br /><br /><br />I live near 30th Ave., close to 21st. It is upsetting about all the new buildings going-up because that will do nothing but raise rents and taxes, which gives landlords the excuse to raise rents. My rent has gone up $300 in the past 5 years. I guess that&#039;s not horrible compared to others, but it went up $150 last year and I fear what the renewal will be that I&#039;ll be getting at the end of the month. I&#039;m apparently paying $200+ more less than the cheapest rents now. The cheapest 1 BRs I&#039;m seeing appear to start at $1700. Does that seem accurate? What is a non-renovated 1BR going for now? The new buildings I&#039;m sure easily go for $2000+ for a 1BR. I sold a bike to one couple a couple of years ago who paying $2000 for their 1BR is a newer building.<br /><br /><br />Gentrification happens everywhere, but I&#039;ve read that Astoria rents have increased 70%+ in the last 5 years, which is ridiculous. <br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_255722">Rents are ridiculously. I have a rent stabilized apartment and am very glad for it. The one bedroom next door to my apartment just rented for $1750. It&#039;s a full one bedroom with a normal-size bathroom, but no kitchen. It&#039;s a kitchenette in the living room. Sorry, but I&#039;d never pay $1750 to not have a separate kitchen. I&#039;ve said before on this and other threads that I don&#039;t like the changes I&#039;m seeing. Unfortunately though, the people moving in here now have nothing to compare to the way that those who&#039;ve lived here all along do. They seem to think that $3000 rents are the norm. Well, they&#039;re not for the average working person. I don&#039;t know anyone who can afford that. </div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_255724"><br />Yup.&nbsp; More white hipsters all the time.&nbsp; And hipsters with baby-strollers is an even worse sign of the direction we are heading.&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp; Also see more white guy/Asian woman couples.&nbsp; More gay couples.&nbsp; All tip-offs.&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp; <br /><br />I recently saw one of the diners ....was it Last Stop....seemed to be closed up??&nbsp; Ugh!<br /><br />As Ladydi said, the newbies are coming here either from other pricey nabes or else from the Midwest where they believe the stereotypes told by other newbies or else by slimey realtors that &#039;you simply CANNOT get anything decent in NYC for less than $3000 minimum&#039;.&nbsp; So then when these squeaky-clean newbies land in Astoria and a broker shows them a &#039;steal&#039; that &#039;won&#039;t last&#039; for &#039;just $2800/month&#039; AND with &#039;one month free rent&#039;, they see stars!&nbsp; lol<br /><br />QueenBoleyn said &quot;My rent has gone up $300 in the past 5 years. I guess that&#039;s not horrible compared to others, but it went up $150 last year ...&quot;<br /><br />QB, do you realize how sad that statement is?&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp; Seriously though...the fact that you say it&#039;s &#039;not horrible compared to others&#039;?&nbsp; (And I assume when you say your rent went up $300 in the past 5 years, you mean by $300 per month??)&nbsp; <br /><br />We tenants need to start dictating what the new &#039;normal&#039; should be.&nbsp; Not the LLs.&nbsp; Not the sleazy realtors.&nbsp; We have more power than we realize.&nbsp; We need to collectively start saying &#039;no&#039; as in &#039;no, I won&#039;t take this apartment...it&#039;s over-priced&#039;.&nbsp; <br /><br />We also need to be more pro-active with our lease renewals.&nbsp; Don&#039;t just sit and wait to see what the LL presents to you&nbsp; for a new lease.&nbsp; Approach him/her a few months in advance (as I plan to do with my LL) and play dumb (as I also plan to do and since this will only be my second renewal lease I&#039;ll be getting).&nbsp; I plan to say &#039;I&#039;m just curious....just so I can know what to expect....do the rents in this building typically increase automatically each year?&#039;&nbsp; (I live in a small apt bldg. where the LL lives with his family.&nbsp; &nbsp;There are 7 rental units.&nbsp; I have indeed lived in other LL-owned bldgs. - one in Harlem and the other in Ridgewood - where the rents did NOT increase, and for a number of years.&nbsp; So I know that annual rent increases are not necessarily something we should &#039;expect&#039;, without question, each and every year!)<br /><br />You see, by asking that question of the LL, it immediately puts him on the defensive.&nbsp; He/she then realizes that you do NOT just &#039;assume&#039; the rent will go up.&nbsp; Many tenants as we know, DO assume the rent will go up each year, and therein lies the problem.&nbsp; &nbsp;Many LLs and especially professional bldg. managers know this fact, and so they just play their part and raise the rent each year, and most tenants just suck up and comply.&nbsp; But when you approach the LL (esp an LL who simply owns a private home)...when you approach them and ask in advance, it sends a clear message that you don&#039;t &#039;expect&#039; the rent to be raised automatically each and every year, and that you don&#039;t WANT it to go up each and every year, and that you might therefore MOVE out, if you don&#039;t like the response you get.<br /><br />And sure, some LLs may not care either way, since they can simply raise the rent even more, for whomever moves in after you.&nbsp; But yet in other instances your LL may really want you to stay,&nbsp; esp if they are very particular about who lives in the same bldg. with them and their family.&nbsp; They may not want the hassle.&nbsp; <br /><br />For example, I also try to make myself &#039;valuable&#039; to our small building by hosting an annual holiday party where I invite everyone in the bldg.&nbsp; I share various lettuces from my balcony garden with others in the bldg.&nbsp; Basically, I am the one in the bldg. trying to create a little community of sorts....a feeling of goodwill in the building...much moreso than the LL who is mainly focused on his own kids and extended family who often visit him.&nbsp; So I&#039;m not so naïve as to not know that I can be seen as an &#039;asset&#039; by some LL&#039;s, because I help to make the overall building a nicer place to live for all tenants.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, my point is that we should never just &#039;accept&#039; that rents will go up each year.&nbsp; We also need to remember there is really no such thing as a &#039;typical&#039; rent in any given&nbsp; neighborhood, and that rents can vary widely depending on the particular block and on whether the apartment is located in a building owned by a little old Greek couple, or a small management company, or by a larger management company that owns multiple luxury buildings throughout the city.&nbsp; <br /><br />Knowledge is power.&nbsp; Get as much info as you can on&nbsp; your apartment&#039;s rent history.&nbsp; I was able to see that prior to my moving in two years ago, the rent had been stable for quite some time, and then right around 2010 or so (right when the LL knew that the Ditmars part of Astoria would be next to gentrify)....that&#039;s when he started raising the rent considerably from lease to lease.&nbsp; I also saw that indeed, he raised the rent EVERY year, so I know that&#039;s his M.O.&nbsp; That&#039;s why I know when I ask him &#039;do the rents typically increase here each year automatically?&#039;, that it may give him pause.&nbsp; I am also purposefully not going to phrase the question as &#039;do YOU typically raise the rents here each year?&#039; but rather as &#039;are the rents here typically raised each year?&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp;That way it&#039;s less accusatory ...less directed at HIM raising the rents.&nbsp; ;-)<br /><br />The more you know about your building and the LL and the rent history, the better a position you will be in to negotiate.&nbsp; It&#039;s also good to find out from other tenants in the building (if you can) what THEY are paying for rent.&nbsp; Like in my building I know that one person (who moved in before me), but yet doesn&#039;t have the outdoor space that I do, pays $100 MORE than me, which makes no sense.&nbsp; So for whatever reason, the LL must have felt he could get them to pay that much, and clearly the tenants complied.&nbsp; <br /><br />Power to the People!!&nbsp; ;-) </div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_256042">it&#039;s been a while, but i&#039;ll respond. my rent went up $300 total in the past five years. like i said, compared to what others are paying in rent, it&#039;s not &#039;bad.&#039; my apt was $800 before 2009. i&#039;m paying about double that now, so technically i&#039;m below the average for the area now. last year it went up $150. the cost to find a new place that most likely would be higher rent and maybe in an area i wouldn&#039;t want to live, and then pay a finder&#039;s fee, was not worth it. <br /><br /><br />how is my statement &#039;sad&#039;, btw?<br /><br /><br />anyway, i just posted an article about brooklyn where tenants are forming groups to try to combat gentrification. <br /><br /><br />my LL isn&#039;t horrible, but is trying to cash-in on the popularity of astoria. he&#039;s renovated other apartments in the building after tenants move out, then jacking-up the rent. granted, they are nice upgrades, i.e., modern, granite counters, but still. the new tenants are young couples in the 1BR and young in the 2 BR. all white. he&#039;s responsed when i asked about the $150 increase was because of tax increases. eh, how can i prove that&#039;s true? he also claimed that my apt would go for a few hundred more &#039;as is.&#039; <span style="font-family: verdana;" class="bbc_font"><span style="font-size: 2px;" class="bbc_size">i have no dishwasher and the bathroom needs a serious upgrade. i am fine with this if it keeps my rent lower than average. </span></span><span style="font-family: verdana;" class="bbc_font"><span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">overall, he was defensive when i asked, which is BS. my increase this year is $50, which i can live with. it&#039;s still below market. we&#039;ll see where i&#039;m at next year.</span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: verdana;" class="bbc_font"><span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">also, one big issues is rent stablization with leases that have preferential and legal rents noted. i pay preferential. my legal rent is over $2,000. i don&#039;t know how that is calculated. the legal rent of $1,800 5 years ago was not accurate, as back then, i don&#039;t think anyone would pay that for my place. it angers me to see articles in papers, the subway, news about how great it is that there are no rent increases for 1 yr leases on rent stablized apartments. this is very misleading, as LLs can increase up to the legal rent amount, even if you&#039;re paying the preferential. so, my LL could increase my rent +$500 if he wanted.</span></span></div>

I guess that&#039;s not horrible compared to others, but it went up $150 last year ...&quot;<br /><br />QB, do you realize how sad that statement is?&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp; Seriously though...the fact that you say it&#039;s &#039;not horrible compared to others&#039;?&nbsp; (And I assume when you say your rent went up $300 in the past 5 years, you mean by $300 per month??)&nbsp; <br /><br />We tenants need to start dictating what the new &#039;normal&#039; should be.&nbsp; Not the LLs.&nbsp; Not the sleazy realtors.&nbsp; We have more power than we realize.&nbsp; We need to collectively start saying &#039;no&#039; as in &#039;no, I won&#039;t take this apartment...it&#039;s over-priced&#039;.&nbsp; <br /><br />We also need to be more pro-active with our lease renewals.&nbsp; Don&#039;t just sit and wait to see what the LL presents to you&nbsp; for a new lease.&nbsp; Approach him/her a few months in advance (as I plan to do with my LL) and play dumb (as I also plan to do and since this will only be my second renewal lease I&#039;ll be getting).&nbsp; I plan to say &#039;I&#039;m just curious....just so I can know what to expect....do the rents in this building typically increase automatically each year?&#039;&nbsp; (I live in a small apt bldg. where the LL lives with his family.&nbsp; &nbsp;There are 7 rental units.&nbsp; I have indeed lived in other LL-owned bldgs. - one in Harlem and the other in Ridgewood - where the rents did NOT increase, and for a number of years.&nbsp; So I know that annual rent increases are not necessarily something we should &#039;expect&#039;, without question, each and every year!)<br /><br />You see, by asking that question of the LL, it immediately puts him on the defensive.&nbsp; He/she then realizes that you do NOT just &#039;assume&#039; the rent will go up.&nbsp; Many tenants as we know, DO assume the rent will go up each year, and therein lies the problem.&nbsp; &nbsp;Many LLs and especially professional bldg. managers know this fact, and so they just play their part and raise the rent each year, and most tenants just suck up and comply.&nbsp; But when you approach the LL (esp an LL who simply owns a private home)...when you approach them and ask in advance, it sends a clear message that you don&#039;t &#039;expect&#039; the rent to be raised automatically each and every year, and that you don&#039;t WANT it to go up each and every year, and that you might therefore MOVE out, if you don&#039;t like the response you get.<br /><br />And sure, some LLs may not care either way, since they can simply raise the rent even more, for whomever moves in after you.&nbsp; But yet in other instances your LL may really want you to stay,&nbsp; esp if they are very particular about who lives in the same bldg. with them and their family.&nbsp; They may not want the hassle.&nbsp; <br /><br />For example, I also try to make myself &#039;valuable&#039; to our small building by hosting an annual holiday party where I invite everyone in the bldg.&nbsp; I share various lettuces from my balcony garden with others in the bldg.&nbsp; Basically, I am the one in the bldg. trying to create a little community of sorts....a feeling of goodwill in the building...much moreso than the LL who is mainly focused on his own kids and extended family who often visit him.&nbsp; So I&#039;m not so naïve as to not know that I can be seen as an &#039;asset&#039; by some LL&#039;s, because I help to make the overall building a nicer place to live for all tenants.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, my point is that we should never just &#039;accept&#039; that rents will go up each year.&nbsp; We also need to remember there is really no such thing as a &#039;typical&#039; rent in any given&nbsp; neighborhood, and that rents can vary widely depending on the particular block and on whether the apartment is located in a building owned by a little old Greek couple, or a small management company, or by a larger management company that owns multiple luxury buildings throughout the city.&nbsp; <br /><br />Knowledge is power.&nbsp; Get as much info as you can on&nbsp; your apartment&#039;s rent history.&nbsp; I was able to see that prior to my moving in two years ago, the rent had been stable for quite some time, and then right around 2010 or so (right when the LL knew that the Ditmars part of Astoria would be next to gentrify)....that&#039;s when he started raising the rent considerably from lease to lease.&nbsp; I also saw that indeed, he raised the rent EVERY year, so I know that&#039;s his M.O.&nbsp; That&#039;s why I know when I ask him &#039;do the rents typically increase here each year automatically?&#039;, that it may give him pause.&nbsp; I am also purposefully not going to phrase the question as &#039;do YOU typically raise the rents here each year?&#039; but rather as &#039;are the rents here typically raised each year?&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp;That way it&#039;s less accusatory ...less directed at HIM raising the rents.&nbsp; ;-)<br /><br />The more you know about your building and the LL and the rent history, the better a position you will be in to negotiate.&nbsp; It&#039;s also good to find out from other tenants in the building (if you can) what THEY are paying for rent.&nbsp; Like in my building I know that one person (who moved in before me), but yet doesn&#039;t have the outdoor space that I do, pays $100 MORE than me, which makes no sense.&nbsp; So for whatever reason, the LL must have felt he could get them to pay that much, and clearly the tenants complied.&nbsp; <br /><br />Power to the People!!&nbsp; ;-)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />My rent goes up every year.&nbsp; I live in a rent stabilized apartment</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_256045">Queen Boleyn: your last paragraph in your recent post is exactly correct.&nbsp; Many folks don&#039;t understand all the subtleties surrounding a rent-stabilized apartment.&nbsp; Most people think they struck gold if they land an R-S apartment, but as you say, there&#039;s the &#039;legal&#039; rent and sometimes a &#039;preferential rent&#039; than can be offered to tenants.&nbsp; Some tenants aren&#039;t told upfront, or don&#039;t understand, that the rent they are currently paying may only be the (lower) preferential rent, but that any lease renewal could suddenly come with a significant bump up to the maximum allowable (legal) rent.<br /><br />Then there&#039;s the whole issue of how long a particular apartment&#039;s rent-stabilized status is going to last.&nbsp; Some folks may not realize that just because an apartment falls under rent-stabilization today, does not necessarily mean that will be the case the next year.&nbsp; Rent-stabilization status is for a fixed time-period, and when that period ends, the rent-stabilization ends and cannot be &#039;reinstated&#039;.&nbsp; The apartment then becomes a &#039;market rate&#039; apartment.<br /><br />Queen Boleyn, what I meant by saying that it&#039;s &#039;sad&#039; you considered your $300 rent increase over 5 years to be &#039;not bad&#039; is that....for many people, such an increase over 5 years would not only be &#039;bad&#039;, but it could not be met.&nbsp; They&#039;d be forced to move out.&nbsp; As I said, it&#039;s all what we are &#039;taught&#039; by the R.E. industry, to consider &#039;normal&#039;.&nbsp; I lived in one NYC apartment from 2001-2008 and the rent never increased.&nbsp; (Granted it was not a well-maintained building...in fact, it was structurally unsound...)&nbsp; I then lived in another NYC apartment from 2008-2012, and that particular apartment building was impeccably maintained with the apartment itself being top-notch.&nbsp; And there too, the rent never increased.&nbsp; (In this place however, the particular neighborhood was not &#039;desirable&#039; the same way Astoria now is...)<br /><br />But what I&#039;m trying to say is that there are many different realities or norms, even within a nabe like Astoria.&nbsp; There are many sections of Astoria, and within those sections things can vary widely by street, by building, etc.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure many renters in Astoria have not had their rents increase for a while, and/or their rent increases have been very small.&nbsp; For other renters in Astoria, rents are going up each year, some more than others.&nbsp; Each renter has their own rental history, and their own perspective on what is to be expected when they rent...what they consider fair or &#039;normal&#039;.&nbsp; And on the higher end of the rental market (where most people are using brokers), much of this is skewed and shaped by the realtors, who naturally want to create a distorted reality, or a new normal, all to get higher rents, ergo commission.&nbsp; On the lower end of the rental market, you have people who don&#039;t use brokers but find new apartments by directly contacting building Supers (this would be in the smaller, older apt buildings in Astoria) or else they find apartments by working directly with small, older apt buildings&#039; management companies (the contact info for which is usually displayed right in the front entryway of these smaller/older buildings).&nbsp; In such instances, brokers are not involved so they can&#039;t distort the renter&#039;s perception of what is a normal/fair rent.<br /><br />Landlords and building managers are very savvy and know &#039;who&#039; their customers/renters are.&nbsp; They know the type of tenants their buildings attract, and who can afford rent increases every year and who cannot.&nbsp; &nbsp;Certain buildings and/or certain sections of Astoria know that even if a particular tenant moves out due to a rent increase they cannot afford, that they can likely attract a new tenant who WILL pay the other rent.&nbsp; Whereas there are other buildings that have such a &#039;personality&#039;, that their tenants are always on the &#039;poorer&#039; end of the pay scale, and always will be, so these buildings are less likely to try and raise rents significantly every year, because they simply know they will never attract the kinds of tenants who can or will accept that.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_256046">thanks for your explanation on everything! i completely agree with your perspective. for me, i&#039;ve been used to a $50 increase each over the last 15 years or so i&#039;ve been a renter. i guess i see it as a standard of living increase. there&#039;s just no way i can prove that a LL is being greedy or s/he really needs to increase because of taxes, improvements, etc. i&#039;ve been lucky to not get a $300 increase that you hear some people complain about. i think you&#039;ve been quite lucky to not get any increases for the years you mentioned. i wish that was more the norm.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_256047"><br />Thought I&#039;d share a website that can be a handy resource whenever one may be looking for a new apartment...<br /><br />This site (NYbits.com)...link for Astoria-specific info is below.... lists most/all residential apartment buildings.&nbsp; I&#039;ve used this to help me when I was looking for a new apt. in Astoria.&nbsp; The site is great in that you can search by borough, by neighborhood, and then by type of apartment/apartment building.&nbsp; <br /><br />But in looking at the Astoria list of buildings today, it seems that things may have changed a bit on the site.&nbsp; Now the only places showing &#039;available&#039; apartments appear to be luxury buildings, with prices to match.<br /><br />There are lists of what tend to have cheaper apartments (i.e., walkup buildings), but in clicking on a few I see no available apartments.<br /><br />Either way these lists can be a good starting point.&nbsp; These lists sometimes included phone numbers direct to the building management companies (though again today, in clicking on a few, I no longer see that info).&nbsp; But if you DO find phone numbers, you also need to be very dedicated to calling these places, asking if they have any vacancies or are expecting any within the next month or two, and then you need to follow-up in a few weeks.&nbsp; It requires a lot of leg work of course, if you want to find a place without a broker.&nbsp; <br /><br />Another tactic I&#039;d use (either with or without the list of apartment buildings in hand), is canvas the nabe and stand outside any building that interests you, for a few minutes.&nbsp; See if you see anyone going in or out...ask if they know if any apts available...see if you can locate bldg. manager name and tel. # near the front entrance or inside the front hallway.&nbsp; Or sometimes bldgs. have the bldg.
