				I wish to make a proposal!&nbsp; I will personally organize an Astorians.com Meeting with our local representatives this fall.&nbsp; It will be held at Riccardo&#039;s.&nbsp; It will be sponsored by the Astoria Renaissance Committee (a Committee I had formed seven years ago made up of the residents around the park).&nbsp; We would invite Giannaris, Vallone, representatives from the 114th Precinct, Sanitation, representatives from Astoria Park and perhaps the Transit Authority.<br /><br />We should focus on three topics, so that we keep this to one and a half hours the most.&nbsp; In order to decide which subjects to focus on, we will put up a poll to determine what people are really concerned about.&nbsp; &nbsp;These are some suggestions:<br /><br />Noise polution (mainly from motorcycles)<br />Trash and littering<br />Graffiti<br />Dog walkers not picking up after their dogs<br />Astoria Park issues<br />Odd smells on Ditmars<br />Over Development of the area<br />Pistilli and various issues with his buildings<br /><br />Please give me an idea of any other subjects that you would like to see on the poll.&nbsp; If there is more time, we can certainly go to a fourth and fifth topic.<br /><br />Since I do not wish to look like a fool in front of our representatives, I would like to get an idea of who from this forum would participate (obviously, if you are actually in town and do not have an emergency).&nbsp; I just wish to see how much interest there is prior to organizing this.&nbsp; Let&#039;s see exactly how many individuals are willing to make the effort to attend a meeting.&nbsp; Once we post the date and time, l will come to you again for your commitment to attend.&nbsp; We can then take attendance at the meeting and see who actually showed up.&nbsp; <br /><br />The only way I was able to get anything done in the past was to attend meetings, to organize meetings, and to get the local papers involved.&nbsp; Alas, I felt that I was all alone in my efforts and became burnt out.&nbsp; I am willing to give it another try, with your assistance.&nbsp; Who is the first one to commit?<br />

				I second Jtrane on people not obeying traffic signals. I notice this more now in the area of where I live where there are more stop signs and very few traffic lights. I&#039;ve had to stare down people in their cars or aggresively start crossing the street, either because they&#039;re not slowing down or just keep rolling through. <br /><br />Debbie, are you trying to bring attention to the Ditmars area only or greater Astoria? I&#039;m hoping this is a group that would help resolve issues in all of Astoria.<br /><br />Graffitti and littering are big issues for me, as well. I would contend that at the meeting, there would be more important things to talk about first, though.

				Frankly, I would be more in favor of getting detailed questions answered than holding discussions on specific problems. Our invited VIPs will not have enough time to discuss issues, but if they are presented with carefully worded questions, by virtue of their attendance, they will be compelled to answer. <br /><br />[OT]<br />I live on the block where there is an FDNY ambulance portal. They run these trucks 24/7 choking their neighbors with the emissions <em>(in the summer they tell us they need to let them run because they need to keep the medicines cold and in the winter they tell us they leave them running because they need to keep the medicines warm)</em>; they park their private cars up and down the block during alternate side parking and don&#039;t get ticketed because they have their FDNY plaques on their dashboard and the street almost never gets cleaned; the EMTs hang outside at all hours of the night having fun and keeping their neighbors up and they park those damn trucks on the sidewalk 3 deep. This is specific to only 1 block in all of Astoria, and this meeting is not the one where this situation should be brought up.<br />[/OT]<br /><br />Please remember, neighbors, that &quot;I don&#039;t know&quot; *IS* an acceptable answer, BUT not as a stand alone sentence without a parenthetical clause. So it should sound more like, &quot;I don&#039;t know, but I will have someone call you on Tuesday with the answer.&quot;<br /><br />Please invite George Dellis and one of the local newspapers.<br /><br />Also, please bring your friends and neighbors. Numbers really matter.

				I&#039;d like to attend, mainly for the motorcycle problem. I call 911 a few times a week to report them, and while it ocassionally seems to help, often they just get worse. Speed bumps on Hoyt should help.<br /><br />Other noise issues: man I don&#039;t know why the family next door insists on coralling all four little kids in their front walkup area, all they do is SCRREEAAMMM all night long. Why don&#039;t they just take a stroll six blocks to the park??&nbsp; :x Ditto fire engines/police cars that go to town with sirens, even when there&#039;s little other traffic after midnight. *That* much noise is unnecessary.<br /><br />Also, never understood why that ambulance hangs out in Astoria Park at the bottom of the hill near the war memorial. Engine always running.&nbsp; :? Nice to have an ambulance around just in case my heart gives out while jogging, but why not shut off the engine?<br />

				Actually, Town Hall meetings are held all the time in the community. Last year UCCA held one about the same time that you are planning yours: <br />http://timesnewsweekly.com/Archives2006/July-Sept.2006/092806/NewFiles/UCCA.html<br /><br />They are held throughout the year. For example: <br />http://www.qgazette.com/news/2007/0131/features/048.html<br /><br />Instead of wasting a lot of effort with making a new meeting, finding 30 people, etc. why don&#039;t you just go to one that is already being planned and save your energy to actually fight the problem instead of organizing a forum to discuss it? <br /><br />The politicians are all intimately aware of problems in this community (unless some of you are prepared to say they are not, then that is another kettle of fish.) They and their staff add up to decades of community presence. What you have experienced, they have collectively seen 10-fold. They get a steady stream of reports on every aspect of this neighborhood. <br /><br />Instead of going to Ricardos and giving them a photo op,&#160;an opportunity to nod, express a few words of concern, then move on, why don&#039;t you use the energy to join up with the groups that are already at the next level? <br /><br />Noise, graffiti, cell towers, sanitation issues, development problems, are all already well represented by volunteers much like yourselves who are out there pulling shopping carts from the East River, and painting over unsightly tags and who desperately (yes that is the correct word) need your help.<br /><br />For example, why don&#039;t you guys go to a 114 Civ-Op meeting, and report back to astorians.com? Be positive. Encourage those good people by showing up. Encourage an astorians.com volunteer team to go on patrol with the Civ-Op group, perhaps even spend a Saturday or so painting over tags? You can learn a hell of a lot more about graffiti in one afternoon with the Pollacks then a month of Sundays at Ricardos. <br /><br />Encourage others on this blog (or whatever you want to call it) to get engaged instead of simply talking or venting.<br /><br />Comments?

Whether or not the Astoria Renaissance Committee or Debbie personally has had any impact on the Community is not the issue at hand. We have repeatedly asked you what your involvement in our Community has been, and you have repeatedly either ignored us or refused to respond.

				Gleason - why do you assume that I (and probably a lot of us) have not actually attended those meetings?&nbsp; I call them LAME, which is why I have absolutely no interest in wasting my time.&nbsp; I have attended the 114th and with all due respect, I was the youngest person there (and I am not that young) and when I posed a question about issues in the area, it was ignored.&nbsp; The Civic Associations Meetings are the same old, same old.&nbsp; I went for the first time when I was in my 20&#039;s and guess what - 20 years later I saw the same people, not doing very much.&nbsp; I then attended a number of Community Board Meetings and I won&#039;t even go into those experiences.&nbsp; What a total waste of my time!!!<br /><br />That is exactly why seven years ago, I started the Astoria Rennaissance Committee.&nbsp; The majority of the people who came to our meetings were from the Astoria Park area.&nbsp; We were able to:<br /><br />Fix the broken equipment in the kiddie park in Astoria Park.<br />The 114th began conducting sweeps of motorcycle racers the year we held our first meeting.<br />Purchase 20 garbage cans for the Park.<br />Organize clean ups in the Park.<br />Get speed bumps installed on 19th Street (I am proud of that accomplishment as it was something I managed to do on my own.)<br /><br />I do not know what ALWPA stands for but I cannot attend one more useless, waste of time meeting.<br /><br />If you pick up some old copies of the Gazette and the Tribune, you will see so many of the wonderful accomplishments we achieved in this area.&nbsp; I was driving this, but work became much more involved so I slowed down.&nbsp; Astorians.com has inspired me to start up again.<br /><br />If I receive 30 commitments, we will have our meeting and you are free to attend or not to attend!

				Thank you everyone - for your support and interest.&nbsp; These are my thoughts - the folks in Astoria who have been &#039;running the show&#039; have been around for years.&nbsp; Believe me, cronyism is rampant.&nbsp; I do not necessarily mean our representatives, who we can vote out of office if we wish, but the folks who belong to the Associations, Boards etc.<br /><br />There is a new wind blowing in Astoria.&nbsp; People moving in are concerned with environment, health, beautifying the area, clean ups etc.<br /><br />I am an Astorian, here since 1973 so I have been witness to the status quo and I am now experiencing something new and exciting.&nbsp; I am delighted with the folks who are moving into the area, and I do not feel that they are simply &#039;transients&#039;.&nbsp; I believe that if the people moving here were able to invest in the area, they would.&nbsp; It has simply become much more expensive these days to buy a home here.<br /><br />Rather than joining the same old board and civic meetings, I would like our Representatives to meet and chat with the new residents.&nbsp; They&nbsp; need to see what&#039;s happening and what our concerns are.<br /><br />I do not mean to be disrespectful of the older residents, in fact, I consider myself one of them.&nbsp; I feel however, that while remaining respectful of the past, we must embrace change and adapt to new experiences.&nbsp; The old and the new can learn from each other.

				Debbie, I believe that we all feel for your efforts at cleaning Astoria Park. Being responsible myself for some 25 feet of Queens sidewalk I can assure you of my firsthand experience increasing filth and litter that characterizes our formerly tidy community - a trend that our community board and local officials seem to be both powerless to address, or even discuss.<br /><br />I was curious as to what &quot;Astoria Renaissance Committee&quot; was, so my questions. You said its been around for&nbsp; seven years, but it has returned all of three hits in Google (with only your name associated with it). I was hoping you could share with us your experiences as to why it died (you did say you wanted to &#039;revive&#039; it)<br /><br />However, I must confess that your depth of knowledge of the community is suspect. <br /><br />The 114th Civ-Op group (which returns 100s of Google hits) and the 114th Precinct are two totally different groups. Both have been around for years. Both are covered extensively by the Gazette. How could you confuse them?<br /><br />And as to your statement &quot;I do not know what ALWPA stands for but I cannot attend one more useless, waste of time meeting&quot; leaves me feeling cold. For your knowledge, they are the folks who are pulling the shopping carts out of the waterfront from the park that you love so much and you tell us you know so well. Been doing it for years.<br /><br />You rant against cronyism, yet you sidestep any discussion of elected officials (I mean really, you haven&#039;t seen an Astoria Civic or a Tenement meeting?) and urge everyone to meet at Ricardos, a fine place, but also the official meeting place for every person &#039;running the show&#039; that you rant about.<br /><br />The point here people, is that there are groups such as ALWPA out there (average age is what - 30s?) that are bringing new direction to our community.<br /><br />Please, join them. The next time you see a posting on this site for one of these groups, go! Please!<br /><br />Organizing another town hall meeting (when one is scheduled soon where 10 - 20 officials are on the stage) is a waste of time. <br /><br />Going to a town hall meeting that someone else has organized and voicing your concerns is great. <br /><br />Joining a group to do something about those concerns is even better.

				NYCMacuser, there is no need to apologize. I am not offended at all by your remarks. Who hasn’t lost their temper? I have said a hell of a lot worse. When people start to personally attack each other, its time to take a step back. It is usually a signal that passion has trumped discussion, and anger logic.<br /><br />If Debbie’s meeting is successful despite my critique, is it bad? If someone joins one group from this dialogue, and ignores my advice, is it a waste of my time?<br /><br />Not at all. <br /><br />Having a difference of opinion is ok. It may drive those who are ‘running the show’ as Debbie says, nuts. But debate, dialogue, and discussion are what we are all about in this country – and its something we should do a lot more of. Accept it. Hopefully, this forum will have many debates in the future. It is how we all grow and learn from each other. <br /><br />Despite that best efforts of those ‘running the show, ’ trying to muzzle a difference of opinion always fails, however. That is, unfortunately, a lesson that they never seem to learn. <br /><br />We certainly will always have differing visions on how to build this community. But to make Astoria a great place to live is our common goal.<br /><br />And really, now, my friend, isn’t that the only thing that really matters here? <br /><br />Besides, I like the touch of humor on this board. Fire away boys and girls and have fun!<br />

				I think there is enough interest here to organize this meeting as long as Gleason does not try to sabotage it (that did cross my mind).&nbsp; I will be in touch soon with the date and time and then Meg, we would need your assistance to get the word out there wherever you can.&nbsp; Everyone should try to recruit one or two people to attend.<br /><br />The suggestion that we use well formulated questions is a good one - as soon as I have the date set, I will ask all of you to submit questions.&nbsp; We can then post them and vote on the best ones.&nbsp; At the meeting, we can try to get through all of them, from the most popular questions to the least.&nbsp; In the interim, please try to formulate your questions so that they are not too long and get to the point.<br /><br />Obviously, if there are twenty questions regarding Transit Service, we will try to select the most comprehensive one, or we can formulate one from the submissions.<br /><br />I&#039;ll be in touch soon!

				Debbie, time to move on...as I have. Good luck to your meeting. <br /><br />Although you told us to look it up, I am sorry that all your self-touted accomplishments never made it&nbsp; to the web. But I do see that you supported that Pistilli building. Real taste there.<br /><br />BTW, next shore line cleanup, do stop by and say hello to all those tired seniors in ALWPA getting dirty at your waterfront.&nbsp; Perhaps you might even put on a pair of gloves and help them. Perhaps even (gasp) go to one of their meetings.<br />………………….. <br /><br />FZ, I applaud your comments, said as a true son or daughter of Astoria. <br /><br />Although this community is notorious around the city with its exceptional pro-development slant (which is starting to haunt our community big-time) there are groups in this community (as in the rest of the city) fighting this blight. It is a struggle, but they will win.<br /><br />Without too much effort you can find them. They would welcome you.<br /><br />I encourage more of you out there to echo his remarks. Post them. Right here.<br /><br />The negative nods you got add to the suspicions of many in this community about this board....<br /><br />The negative nods I might get on this post bring me a chuckle. ‘Til later folks!<br /><br />

				Debbie, I absolutely applaud your community spirit and dedication to making Astoria a better neighborhood, and firmly believe that community activism is truly the best route to take when trying to effect change. I have to admit, though, that Gleason has a point when he (she?) suggests participating in, or joining one of the already established community groups rather than resurrecting the Astoria Renaissance Committee.<br /><br />Various Astoria community groups have been around for ages and while, as you say, they tend not to change much over the years, the best way to get these groups to change is to breathe new life into them, bring in fresh faces and new perspectives. These groups have spent years building relationships with the government entities who are empowered to actually make the changes and address the concerns that arise in this community -- why not tap into those resources and utilize those relationships?<br /><br />The phrase &quot;too many cooks&quot; comes to mind -- it just seems that if there are X number of smaller groups going to our local representatives with the same complaints/concerns, the message just gets watered down and weakened. If a larger, more organized, well-established and reputable group goes to the Reps with one loud voice, I can&#039;t see how that voice could be ignored. <br /><br />I would imagine that every community group has the same goal in mind -- making Astoria better. Maybe I&#039;m naive, but I don&#039;t see why those groups can&#039;t work <strong>together</strong> as a united front for that single common goal.<br />

				I feel that Debbie is on the right track with reviving an independent organization that is isn&#039;t beholden to current status quo.&nbsp; Most of the &quot;established&quot; groups in Astoria are guided by the very people we are attempting to influence.&nbsp; Unless we took over an organization with numbers, it is very difficult to enact change.&nbsp; <br /><br />As a lifetime resident of Astoria, I have been a member of several of the established organizations and have seen no desire for change.&nbsp; Even when legitimate concerns are voiced, they are often times brushed aside.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to completely trash the existing organizations, they have their purposes.&nbsp; However, independent grassroots have their uses as well.<br /><br />If this panel was organized by individuals not members of Astoria&#039;s usual suspects, or at least in conjunction with some independent voices, we might get the opportunity to really get some answers to our concerns.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just my two cents.

				I&#039;m just brainstorming a bit here so please don&#039;t feel that I think this is the way it has to be.<br /><br />I think part of the reason that groups can&#039;t work together is that many groups have their own agenda and only work on one issue or two (i.e. &quot;too much development&quot;). I like the idea of having &quot;Astorians.com&quot; organized meetings where we choose issues that we as a community want to bring before our representatives (as is happening now) and then send the word out to any other groups that are also interested in presenting on those specific issues for that meeting. i.e. we pick three issues that we would like to address, we invite the representatives we&#039;d like to be there, and then reach out to other groups who may like to join the discussion about those three topics (it could be two topics, or one topic even - doesn&#039;t really matter as long as it&#039;s organized.) Then the next time we meet we may have three different issues (or maybe two old and one new), and again organize it and then invite any other groups that would like to be involved in that discussion. It may be different people and different groups each time, but I imagine that you&#039;ll end up with a core community comprised of many smaller groups that work together on the areas of common interest, and yet each can still have its own role apart from any other groups as well. I see no reason for &quot;Astorians.com&quot; to have its own exclusive group, nor do I (currently) like the idea of one exclusive existing group taking &quot;Astorians.com&quot; under it&#039;s wings. Speaking personally, there are a lot of local politics that I don&#039;t really want to align myself with exclusively - though I may share areas of common interest with one or more of these groups.<br /><br />I think one of the reasons this board does so well in terms of creating dialog is because it&#039;s a kind of &quot;meta&quot; conversation where people from many groups collaborate and discuss. If we can organize community meetings in the same spirit that exists already on the board here I think we may end up with a really dynamic yet effective community voice.

				Debbie is bringing something unique to the table. Something that none of the &#039;other&#039; groups has ever been able to establish. All of those groups are homogeneous. I have been to most of them over the years. I have tried to encourage them to open up to different agendas and different age and ethnic groups. They are established and rooted in their ways. They want to be the top dog and we want action in many areas. Debbie is proposing a heterogeneous group comprised of all Astorians; none with agendas except to get some things accomplished in as short a time frame as is possible. <br /><br />I personally don&#039;t care if the group name is Astoria Poopoo Kaka; I don&#039;t care if the meeting place is Riccardo&#039;s, a local church basement or under the viaduct; I don&#039;t care who takes charge of the organizing; I also don&#039;t care if there are dissenting opinions presented . . . I do care that it is open to everyone who cares about Astoria, who is willing to give a little of themselves over a long period of time, who is willing to participate to show unity. <br /><br />If Debbie can get our local representatives in one place at the same time, we need to help in every way we can to accomplish our goals: a cleaner, safer, healthier, unified Community with mutual long term goals for those of us who plan on making our lives here.<br /><br />I applaud Debbie for her willingness to organize. <br /><br />I also had to withdraw from being as involved as I was due to a physical/medical issue. I spent my lifetime preventing the splintering of this Community, fighting the powers-that-be from the cronyism that is pervasive to this Community. I truly love Astoria, and I very much want to see her continue to be what she has always been. A destination, not a stopover!

				Hello all - I have tried calling around to see when the Civic Association, 114th Precinct and Community Board have their monthly meetings.&nbsp; This is in an effort to schedule our meeting properly.&nbsp; It seems that everyone is on vacation and I am not getting anywhere.&nbsp; Do any of you recall which day of the week and which week in the month they meet?

				As I recall, The Astoria Civic Association meets on the 3rd Thursday of the month, and the 114th Precinct Community Council meets on the 4th Tuesday of the month. I am sure the Pete Jr.&#039;s office will have the information available. Thanks for doing the grunt work, Debbie.

				On behalf of the Long Island City Alliance, which mostly represents Astoria, I will commit to having at least some of our members there, including myself, the secretary/treasurer. Our next meeting is on Sept. 18th, so I would hope to not have it coincide. These are exactly the issues that we discuss at our meetings and we&#039;ve had a lot of success in getting city officials to take notice and even take some action. We&#039;ve also empowered community members to take their own action. I think it would be great to combine forces, so we will be happy to weigh in which issues to focus on and the date of the meeting. If anyone wants to communicate with someone at our group, our number is: 718-595-2052. (By the way, we are NOT connected with any of the Powers That Be - we&#039;re just renters and home owners from all walks of life who want to improve this community.)

				Everyone - As soon as I return from vacation, we will have the date set.&nbsp; I have tried hard to get this done before I leave but everyone is away, including Lucille from Board One who is the best contact.&nbsp; I will get the date set as well as the venue, will send out the invitations and will post the date on Astorians.com.&nbsp; You can help by spreading the word, distributing fliers (I will put one together) and attending the meeting.&nbsp; This will be an Astoria Renaissance Meeting so that Astorians.com can remain a neutral entity.&nbsp; <br /><br />I will be in touch by the second week in September!<br /><br />Astoria is a great place to live and we can make it better!&nbsp; Keep the faith!

				Just an update - I am having trouble finding a location right now.&nbsp; I am tempted to rent out the large space at the Bohemian Hall ($400) and ask for any contribution at the event.&nbsp; I hope to cover at least half the cost with contributions.&nbsp; Any suggestions?<br /><br />Normally, we meet at Riccardos but I have had trouble getting in touch with Tony (the owner).

				Yes, there&#039;s easily room for that many and more. It&#039;s an ideal space. For more information you can call the Greater Astoria Historical Society at 718-278-0700. I&#039;m not with their organization, rather with the Long Island City Alliance. We meet at their space and we love it.
