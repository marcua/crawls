Same-day registration is also available. <br />Why:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Walk4Hearing was created in 2006 by HLAA to raise awareness about hearing loss as a public health concern and to eradicate the stigma associated with it.&nbsp; Hundreds of New Yorkers participate so that people of all ages—from babies to seniors—can get the programs, support and services they need to meet the challenges of hearing loss. Through the annual Walk4Hearing, HLAA has been able to bring together a wide range of groups including parents of children with hearing loss, aging baby boomers, young adults, and returning war veterans. Hundreds of walkers participate, including families, friends, co-workers, educators, physicians, audiologists, students, and business leaders.<br />About HLAA:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Hearing Loss Association of America (HLAA) is the nation’s leading consumer membership and advocacy group for the 36 million Americans challenged by hearing loss. Each year, Walks in major cities around the country support HLAA’s educational programs and services, as well as critical national and local advocacy work.&nbsp; This is the fifth NYC Walk4Hearing presented by HLAA’s Manhattan Chapter. <br />&nbsp;
