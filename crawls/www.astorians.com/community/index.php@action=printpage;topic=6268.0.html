				Spitzer doesn&#039;t even think its going to pass.&nbsp; He&#039;s pushing it as a part of his campaign promises.&nbsp; But you&#039;re not going to see too much strong arming from the gov to get this one going.<br /><br />The good thing is that everyone will have to put their cards on the table.&nbsp;

				It will pass, but not this year.&nbsp; The best we can hope for this year is passage by the New York State Assembly.&nbsp; I think we have a solid 66 Assemblymembers ready to vote for marriage, and we need 76 to pass.&nbsp; There are just over 50 members on the fence.&nbsp; Once we get the numbers of committed yes votes up to 80, we will see a hearing in the Assembly Judiciary Committee, followed by a vote by the full Assembly.&nbsp; In the Senate, the Republican leadership will not allow the bill a vote.&nbsp; <br />As to what you can do, join Marriage Equality New York for the Wedding March over the Brooklyn Bridge on Saturday, May 19, 11 a.m. congregation in Foley Square, followed by a March over the Bridge and a rally/show in Cadman Plaza in Brooklyn.&nbsp; It will be fun and will help raise awareness.&nbsp; Letters to Assemblymember Michael Gianaris and State Senator George Onorato asking them to co-sponsor the bill are also in order!

				Glad to be of service. I&#039;ll be at the Wedding March (hopefully with my boyfriend in tow).&nbsp; I&#039;m the Political Director for MENY, so I&#039;ll be coordinating the elected officials participation.&nbsp; We have a GREAT rally planned (Congressmember Anthony Weiner, Council Member John Liu, State Senator Tom Duane, Assemblymembers Danny O&#039;Donnell, Dick Gottfried and Matt Titone all coming!)&nbsp; (Matt is the newly elected openly gay Assemblymember from Staten Island!&nbsp; Can you believe it!?)<br />I know Joepocky and his boyfriend (who is also on the MENY board) are coming and think we&#039;ll have a good sized Astoria contingent!&nbsp; Maybe we can meet up and go as a group on the train?

				Barring any unforeseen circumstances, the gf and I will be in attendance as well... apparently she&#039;s been telling me about it for ages but I guess I, uh, wasn&#039;t paying attention.&nbsp; :oops:<br /><br />And to think, we&#039;re not even married... yet. :wink:
