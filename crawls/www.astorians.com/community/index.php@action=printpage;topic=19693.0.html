				Hey Guys! What a great forum!&nbsp; I am making the move to Astoria and couldn&#039;t be more excited.&nbsp; Unfortunately it&#039;ll be very quick and I won&#039;t have time to really look around too much besides the internet.&nbsp; Can you guys, who know the areas off the n/q train let me know some of the beautiful luxury building rental names?&nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you so much for your time.&nbsp; Google isn&#039;t really helping me so if you could, that would be so appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks again.

				So you are moving to Astoria but don&#039;t have time to actually look at apartments, and want others to provide names of the &quot;beautiful luxury buildings&quot;? Sorry, but nothing about this seems authentic at all.

				I don&#039;t really understand what the big deal is?&nbsp; I may have to rent without seeing the unit first so if I can look some luxury apartments up online based on their name and see photos, info, etc etc... I&#039;m confused what you think my motive for taking time out of my life to ask that question could possibly be....Anyone else, with some actual answers instead of nonsense?&nbsp; Thanks!

				Well, your screenname includes the name of a brand new &quot;beautiful luxury building&quot; in Astoria, for starters, and every one of your posts has been about that. It just seems a little odd, that&#039;s all.

				It&#039;s true, there are just not many luxury rentals in Astoria - but if you want to buy a condo - for some reason, we have a crapload of those.&nbsp; Personally I think most of these are way too expensive either way, considering most are far from the train and most conveniences, and built way too quickly with poor construction and cheap fixtures and appliances.&nbsp; There are exceptions of course.&nbsp; But you&#039;re better off trying Long Island City or Dumbo or Williamsburg - I think they&#039;re more known for their luxury rentals.

				To find a good rental apartment in Astoria it takes legwork...it is as simple as that.&nbsp; <br /><br />It is highly unlikely (as it seems you have already found) that you will find what you are looking for on your computer.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would also very extremely wary about taking an apartment sight unseen.&nbsp; That is a recipe for disaster.&nbsp; <br /><br />Have you been to Astoria?&nbsp; I ask that b/c looking for a &quot;beautiful luxury building rental&quot; just isn&#039;t a logical question if you are familiar with the neighborhood.&nbsp; That is not commonplace in Astoria.&nbsp; It is a neighborhood that is typically smaller buildings and homes.&nbsp; I find it kind of odd that your heart is set on a building that you have not even seen in person.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				LIC seems more appropriate for what ANWW85 is looking for.&nbsp; Plenty of &quot;luxury&quot; buildings there.

				Okay.... wow... I just came here for some answers... and thank you for those who suggested long island city. <br /><br />First of all- You can absolutely rent a apartment without seeing it first based on floor plans and photos.&nbsp; I have done this 3 times.&nbsp; Fell in love with every single one of them.&nbsp; So, to each his own on that one.<br /><br />Second of all - If you are doing what I am doing and renting without seeing the place first because you CAN&#039;T get there before your move in date, you would have your heart set on a building via the internet.&nbsp; How else would I have my heart set on something ? Via my imagination and the sky?&nbsp; Come on..&nbsp; Everyone has different circumstances and this is mine.&nbsp; So you can call it strange - it&#039;s my reality.<br /><br />THIRD of all - There ARE luxury buildings all over Astoria.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been there, and i&#039;ve seen them.&nbsp; This is before I ever knew I was going to be living there or obviously I wouldn&#039;t be on this board at all.&nbsp; I am not talking about 60 floor high rise luxury buildings.&nbsp; Obviously they exist...Astoria N/W, Astoria 27...I meant buildings like that in that area off the N/Q. That&#039;s all.&nbsp; Sorry my question was SO ridiculous to you guys.&nbsp; And thanks for those helpful responses.

				If there are luxury buildings all over Astoria and you&#039;ve been there and have seen them why are you asking for recommendations? <br /><br />Viral marketing or just vile?

				And with that, I am locking this thread.&nbsp; AstoriaNWannabe85, your anger isn&#039;t welcome here.&nbsp; This is not just an internet discussion forum, this is a neighborhood forum and most of the posters here are -&gt; your neighbors.&nbsp; If you can&#039;t handle ordinary responses in answer to your questions in a mature and respectful manner, then yes, please do take your s___ elsewhere.&nbsp; You don&#039;t get to dictate the kinds of answers you get on a forum, and throwing a temper tantrum isn&#039;t going to win you any supporters either.&nbsp; <br /><br />Good luck to you.<br /><br />- Mod
