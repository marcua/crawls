			Hallo-<br /><br />I&#039;m moving from one place in Astoria to another.&nbsp; Can somebody recommend good movers?&nbsp; As of right now, I&#039;m doing it with the uhaul for money&#039;s sake, but if I get a good, cheap rec, I would reconsider for the ease.&nbsp; Also, it would need to be people who work well on short notice, since I plan on moving this Sat.&nbsp; Any recs are appreciated!&nbsp; Thanks.<br /><br />Also, a public thank you to Handyman, who will be helping me take down a larger item if I decide to stick with the uhaul.&nbsp; He is the man.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)

			i&#039;ve used these guys twice personally, and friends have used them 5-6 more times.<br /><br />moving748@hotmail.com<br />718-569-2089<br /><br />it&#039;s two guys and a 15&quot; foot truck. they bring blankets and pads with them. $60/hour. last move was only like 3 hours, they are pretty quick.

			Are movers usually good about being kinda careful with stuff? I&#039;m debating hiring people, but part of my hesitation is that I&#039;d rather not have to worry about my bed or desk or other things that don&#039;t fit in boxes getting scratched.

			yeah, they are pretty good. i was worried about my TV, it&#039;s big and older. i even inquired about insurance but they didn&#039;t offer it, which only worried me more.<br /><br />but they were real good about it. if you&#039;re worried about something, just let them know. they&#039;ll take their time with it.<br /><br />a short chair leg popped off during one of my friend&#039;s moves. they came back the next day to repair it.
