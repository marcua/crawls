				Many people are unaware that Licensed Massage Therapy &amp; Therapeutic Exercise is covered by No-Fault Insurance. :-o<br /><br />I have been Licensed and practicing in the medical field my entire career, and I accept No-fault as payment for your injury care.<br />Many people have suffered a MVA (motor vehicle accident) usually enter into ongoing treatment with a Chiropractor or Physical Therapist or both. <br />Go for a series of MRI&#039;s, CT scans, X-Rays etc.... in most instances, the main causes of dysfunction and pain are not addressed, Why? :?<br /><br />The Chiropractor focuses on the bony&nbsp; of the spine/nerves.<br />The PT focuses on muscles/joints, exercises, bikes, treadmill, ultrasound, electric stimulation etc...... you go three times per week, perhaps you need medication, or even surgery.&nbsp; :cry:<br /><br />The Licensed Medical Massage Therapist focuses on the Body, Mind, Spirit connection, as well as soft tissue dysfunctions and myofascia. <br />All of the aspects that are causing you discomfort, and others that were there even prior to your accident.<br />Massage is the least invasive modality of treatment, with the most effective and lasting results.&nbsp; <br /><br />The FACT is that you can actually surpass your normal state of health to achieve an OPTIMAL state of health and well-being, on multiple levels.<br />Free of Drugs if you chose, minimize unnecessary surgery, minimize unnecessary visits to practitioners that don&#039;t help much.<br /><br />Medical Massage/PT/Chiropractic have overlapping modalities:<br /><br />Chiropractors adjust the spine and limbs-But no not address the musculature-the muscles pull the bones out of alignment. <br />Massage therapist can not adjust bones; however, during natural movement of joint structures -often this happens naturally and non abruptly.<br />Both PT&#039;s &amp; MT&#039;s perform massage but PT&#039;s are not Massage Therapists.<br />Both perform therapeutic exercise with patients, Massage Therapists are more hands on (no treadmills or Bikes)<br />Both are educated in Anatomy &amp; Physiology, Biology, pathology, Kinesiology,&nbsp; gait training, trauma, etc.......<br />Chiro &amp; PT utilize electrical muscle stimulation - Massage therapist use our hands and heat packs.<br />Chiro &amp; PT utilize Ultrasound - Massage therapists suggest other more natural &amp; less invasive ways to induce new tissue formation, release adhesion, prevent scarring, &amp; increase circulation.&nbsp; <br />Massage Therapist can treat post surgery wounds. <br />Medical Massage therapists are able to understand medical and radiological reports and films.<br />Massage Therapy does not require a doctors referral, however; when dealing with injuries I consult with other health care practitioners involved in my patients care. <br /><br />Call today for your consultation, or refer someone you know that has suffered a Car Accident.<br /><br />Be Well<br />Marlene Rodriguez-Castelluccio, LMMT<br />Journey Into Wellness Integrated Healing<br />Two locations:<br />32-03 Steinway Street, Astoria<br />84-37 Main Street, Briarwood<br />718-717-2111<br /><span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size">[url]www.askjourneyintowellness.blogspot.com]www.askjourneyintowellness.blogspot.com][url]www.askjourneyintowellness.blogspot.com (http://[url=http://www.askjourneyintowellness.blogspot.com)[/url]</span>[/size]<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
