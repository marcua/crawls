				Anyone out there pregnant, loving it or not necessarily loving it? Looking to compare notes on local crib buying, eating, maternity clothes. I don&#039;t want to bore my non-pregant friends with this and don&#039;t have any pregnant local friends (and watching them drink is not as easy as i thought it would be, especially when my bedtime has turned to about 10 or 11.)

				My sister was in the same situation when she was pregnant with my niece, looking for other pregnant women to commiserate with.&nbsp; She found a website that she ended up using a lot.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s called &quot;Pregnancy Weekly&quot;.&nbsp; It has advice about all kinds of things, and it matches you up with women who are in the same trimester so you can share all of your frustrations together.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s exactly what you&#039;re looking for but it really helped my sister.&nbsp; She still keeps in touch with a lot of the women.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)

				Alexa, I know this is going to sound kind of silly, but here goes anyway. First of all congratulations. Be sure to keep a journal. You will find it a treasure in just a few years. <br /><br />My first, almost term, pregnancy was around 4 decades ago. I was already showing by 3 months. I was walking my dog in Astoria Park and I was approached by a girl around my own age who was also pregnant. She told me she knew no-one who was pregnant and that her mother had passed away a few years prior and wondered if I could answer a question for her. I couldn&#039;t. But, she walked me home to drop off the dog, and then we went to the library together to look up the answer to her question. Before we both got back home, we bumped into 4–5 other pregnant girls and we all exchanged phone numbers. Before the end of the week, we all got together for milk shakes, yes, you read that correctly, milk shakes and a gab fest! We remained friends for many years, even as our children grew and families moved, we always exchanged holiday cards and now emails. There must have been something in the water supply that year because there were 4 sets of twins born on my block. It was wonderful to commiserate with other women going through exactly what was happening to me. When we all got together, we puked, passed gas, ran for the potty as our bladders burst, kvetched about our swollen, hurting breasts and laughed at ourselves and each other&#039;s misery. Having shared all those good and rotten memories was a remarkable time for all of us. When I was confined to bed rest (at month 6) up to 10 pregnant women would arrive at my house with pizza and sit on my bed and and we would laugh ourselves silly. <br /><br />No-one is going to think you are nuts if you stop them on the street and congratulate them on being pregnant and ask to be their friend. You might even find women on your own block who are also pregnant; or in your church; or where you work. Start a little local group of your own. It&#039;s also like having built-in friends for your baby. It is also a great baby sitting exchange for weekend dinners out, dentist and doctor appointments and later on even weekend getaways.<br /><br />I can remember the very first time I had 4 port-a-cribs and 2 carriages set up in my living room for a Saturday night. Two of my friends had weddings to go to and one had an out-of-town funeral and I don&#039;t remember the other reasons why I had such a crew—but it was such an experience. I enlisted the help of a couple of single friends . . . perhaps that night was the reason neither of them have had any children! I already had twins, so what&#039;s a few more?<br /><br />Alexa, even if you go on to have another dozen children, this is the one you will always remember, just like the first time you . . . you know! Make it special. Journal it. Take growth pictures. Build memories.

				NYCMacuser, Thanks so much for taking the time to respond. I might just go ahead and do that. I&#039;m not showing yet, which makes it tough for other to approach me, but I&#039;ll keep my eyes open around the block. There was some good advice about web sites some people on this board gave, but really i was looking for a local. all my girlfriends have had their first baby already and have other steps to address now and other topics I can&#039;t relate to as much. I&#039;ll keep looking. Thanks again.

				*waves hello*<br /><br />I&#039;m pregnant, too. :) Early days yet-- barely 12 weeks-- but I have a preschooler already and I&#039;m full of opinions. ;)<br /><br />Moved to Astoria when Young Sam was only 3 months, so I don&#039;t have prior experience Being Pregnant in Astoria... but I&#039;d be happy to meet up for milkshakes. (mmm, Oleput milkshakes...)<br /><br />There&#039;s an Astoria Stay At Home Meetup Group that is incredibly active and hosts regular playgroups for everyone from infants to toddlers. I also spend a lot of time on Babycenter.com, which is useful for generic questions.<br /><br />I&#039;m a stay at home mom, so my schedule is really flexible if you do want to meet up. :)<br /><br />alia

				I&quot;m barely 12 weeks as well. Just heard the heartbeat today and saw he/she waving on the sono...very cool. I would love to meet up. I don&#039;t plan on being a stay-at-home as I&#039;m just getting started on my career, but as a professor, I&#039;m not exactly at the office 40 hours a week either, so I think it will work out well. We should set up a time to enjoy that milkshake (I&#039;m on watermelon right now...yum.)

				Oleput sounded like a good idea to me...now I can&#039;t get the idea of milkshakes out of my head.<br /><br />12 weeks today, saw the baby and heard the heartbeat, and so it feels official. But I need to get out and walk and I have such a heard time getting myself motivated. I&#039;m currently on broadway while my house is being renovated but will be back in the ditmars area soon.

				Hi! I am glad that you are doing OK.<br />Don&#039;t worry about showing that you are pregnant . I&#039;m nearly there and sometime people look at me a bit funny when I say that ,like &quot;she probably doesn&#039;t know when she is due&quot; ,because my belly is small . And I&#039;m tall and slim,so.... I didn&#039;t gain so much weight ,about 20-25ponds.From behind I don&#039;t even look pregnant . I don&#039;t care ! As long as the baby is fine ,I&#039;m fine .<br />I&#039;m only starting now to walk like pregnant women. I have good days and bad days ,but is all so normal .My dog is keeping me fit with the long walks ,so is all good .<br />Good to hear from you .<br />Keep well! :-)

				Hi Preggers ladies,<br />I&#039;m currently on the other side of pregnancy. My son is 15+ months and it&#039;s so much fun!<br />Here are a couple of resources that I wish I&#039;d had when I was preggo...<br /><br />The Yoga Room in Astoria has a PreNatal yoga class. Having done a fair amount of yoga in my time, I opted to do regular yoga to keep fit while pregnant, but found that I had missed out on joining a tight-knit group of women in the area who are a great support system for eachother.<br />Here&#039;s the site: http://www.the-yoga-room.com/yogaroom_astoria/yoga_classes/yoga.html#gentle<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if any of you are planning to breastfeed, but it really worked well for my son and for me. Part of the reason it was successful for us was that we got off to a great start. Our local chapter of La Leche League (a breastfeeding support system that is worldwide AND local!) has a couple of meetings in the area. Check it out while you&#039;re still pregnant so that you&#039;ll already have the resources you need when you need them:<br />http://www.lllusa.org/NYE/Queens/queens.HTM<br />You can also get online and get support from the comfort of your own home computer.<br /><br />Another one that was so helpful was the meetup group here, in astoria for moms. It&#039;s called the &quot;stay at home moms&quot; meetup, but there are lots of part-and full-time working moms in it. There are playgroups and &quot;moms night out&quot; events. No formal mandatory meeting, just fun and social. I remember wandering around Astoria the first few months of my son&#039;s life literally going up and down streets looking for other moms of young babies. How frustrating it was! But getting hooked up with this group will give you lots of moms to get chatty with. Some of them are my best friends now! http://sahm.meetup.com/817/<br /><br />And, incidentally, I have chosen to focus my health counseling practice on moms-to-be and new moms, so check me out if you have questions on which foods are best for you and your baby right now and ways to make your pregnancy a little more comfortable. http://www.angelsonghealth.com/welcome.html<br /><br />Congratulations to all and good luck!

				Congrats!!<br /><br />I&#039;m due April 8th and am starting 35 weeks on Tuesday. Not too uncomfortable yet, with the exception of working at the computer. <br /><br />Jennifer, you are due at a nice time since you can keep active in the spring and summer. Youmight have a big belly all summer long, but one of the things I found really frustrating is how sedentary i&#039;ve become because it is soooo cold outside, that might nightly walks are not fun and then I don&#039;t do them. <br /><br />Good luck with it.

				Ha! I know how you feel. Not only are none of my friends currently pregnant, they aren&#039;t evevn married or dating... so I am really out of the loop with most of my close friends. Watching them drink definitely got easier! I am sure in four weeks and am so ready, yet so not at the same time! I cna&#039;t quite come to terms with the fact that I won&#039;t be pregnant anymore, and that the cause of it will be actually having child! But, DH and I are very excited, just nervous as well since this is our 1st.

				July 3rd! eek! DH and I went to our last birthing class last night! Thank God those are over!<br /><br />I am so excited and scared and just everything all at once. We have NOTHING ready because we are buying a house, but won&#039;t be able to move in until after baby since we haven&#039;t closed yet. so there is no point in setting up a nursery in our apt. now... so i feel so discombobulated because I don&#039;t have thing organized! All the stuff we need for baby coming home, car seat, bassinet, etc. is at my parents in a pile waiting to be brought up!<br /><br />Anyone else almost due?

Sure diapers and air conditioning were needed, but they certainly didn&#039;t feel like they were exclusives. <br /><br />Now let&#039;s see if I remember that joyful period . . . ahh, yes . . . lots of caffeine was also needed. If you&#039;re lucky enough to fall asleep, the baby passing wind in another room sounds like an approaching tornado and will wake you in a NYC second. <br /><br />Moms are needed too; yours, his, anyones who can take a few hours to come over and help a bit. A cook. Yeah, someone who not only likes to cook, but has the time and energy to cook some healthy and tasty food to help sustain your life while you try to make it through the baby&#039;s first 3 months of trying to communicate with the outside world! A part-time secretary would also be a great asset at that time. Someone needs to get those thank you cards written and posted ASAP and you sure as hell won&#039;t have either the time or the inclination. Please, whatever you do, don&#039;t forget to have a supply of chocolate in the house before you go into labor. You&#039;re going to be routinely craving it after every feeding. Don&#039;t be cheap, either. Buy yourself the good quality kind. And, you will also need a good package of flash cards. Yes, that is what I said, flash cards! If you are lucky enough to still have the energy to get out of the house for say, just a walk, you don&#039;t want to waste your energy answering all those dumb questions . . . that&#039;s where the flash cards come in. &quot;Yes, he does have a lot of hair, doesn&#039;t he.&quot; &quot;No, I don&#039;t think he is cold without a hat.&quot; &quot;I actually wasn&#039;t thinking Harvard or Yale, I was kind of imagining Princeton.&quot; &quot;Yes, the (dog(s)/cat(s) really like the baby and no I am not planning on getting rid of either.&quot; Same questions, different annoying people. And if you can arrange it, you will also need a good friend willing to do your mani/pedi so that you can feel almost human again. Try to get yourself one of those Hollywood personal trainers, that come over to your house when you call them, so that you won&#039;t have to deal with feeling lazy about trying to lose the weight that helped the baby be born so healthy. Last thing I vividly remember needing . . . someone to tell you every day how beautiful you look, how perfect you and the baby look together; someone who wants nothing more than to hold you in their strong, masculine arms while you nurse, or simply nap; who will wake you with a snack that you didn&#039;t have the strength to make for yourself; someone who will protect you from all the incoming calls that you would rather not have to answer; someone who will only allow visitors when they are there to be a buffer between you and the things you know are so much more important than company and the same someone who will photographically document every second of the the entire first year of your baby&#039;s life.<br /><br />You know, diapers and air conditioning is not a bad place to start!

				NYCMacUser--so basically, I need a wife:)<br /><br />My DH is actually great in terms of support. A lot of things on that list, he&#039;ll be taking care of. He doesn&#039;t work a normal 9-5 job, so his hours are a little different which is actually good for us. <br /><br />Definitely have the swing and bouncy seat ready to roll:) I managed to rearrange some bookshelves so all the kids clothes aren&#039;t in a plastic bin and I have a little easier access to them. My mom is only a couple of hours away... and will be here frequently (it would be daily if not for my sister being due with the 1st granddaughter 2 weeks after I am due!)<br /><br />Feeling better after doing a lot of organizing this weekend (an excuse to stay inside in the AC), but once I have that closing date, I will feel a million times more organized!

				Hey all - checking in with pregnancy update<br /><br />I&#039;m 35 weeks.&nbsp; Had a sonogram yesterday and the little guy is about 5 lbs 9 oz (I know they&#039;re notoriously inaccurate - but it&#039;s <em>something</em>).&nbsp; His head is currently only 9cm in diameter (which doesn&#039;t sound too painful to me) I know this will change over the next few weeks.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been really healthy since May - yipeee (after months of walking pneumonia)<br /><br />School (work) ended at the end of June - so i spent two weeks sitting on my butt at the beach and now i&#039;m back in town.... just waiting.&nbsp; <br />Made it to the yoga room&#039;s prenatal class last night (it felt great).&nbsp; I&#039;m walking a few miles every day and doing yoga via dvd (or will return to the yoga room for social aspect). <br /><br />Where are you all with your pregnancies and new babies ?&nbsp; <br /><br />How do you feel?<br /><br />any advice?<br /><br />One of my girlfriends said &quot;MOVIES&quot; go see as many movies as you can b/c you won&#039;t be going any more.&nbsp; &nbsp;So I think i&#039;m going to try to hit up all that I can this month.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />

				on movies: netflix will be your friend, post-baby.<br /><br />anything that requires more than 15 minutes of your undivided time (hanging out at a bookstore, going to a museum, doing a craft project, having an adult conversation that doesn&#039;t involve poop, napping)... do it now.<br /><br />also... shopping. buying clothes is really hard (trying clothes on is especially tricky)...<br /><br />i either buy things online (freshdirect for the win!) or only when my mom is visiting.<br /><br />have you hooked up with the astoria stay at home mom&#039;s group? i&#039;m ambivalent about them, but they host a lot of events. some as low key as coffee with other moms, some that are huge extravaganzas. i recommend a trial membership-- they&#039;re on meetup.com.

				Mine is three months now and a doll but I hae soooo much I can share about what got me through those very difficult and nerve-racking first couple of weeks. A lot of it also depends on if you are breastfeeding...message me and we&#039;ll get together. <br /><br />Three months is awesome...they are so responsive and giggle and smile and watch you when you are cleaning up and when you go to get them in the morning, the look at you like the sun rises and sets with you.

				hello,<br /><br />I am new to Astorians and really glad to find this site -- and this thread, since I&#039;m also pregnant in Astoria! I&#039;m 29 weeks, and looking forward to being a parent in this community too. (I&#039;ve lived in Astoria about 8 years, with no idea something like astorians.com existed. I&#039;ve really enjoyed living here, but I guess becoming a parent makes you reach out in different ways.) <br /><br />I&#039;ve been doing prenatal yoga as well, though I haven&#039;t been to the yoga room (I go to a place on 9th ave called Realbirth, they have classes Tuesdays &amp; Thursdays in a good after-work time slot). Do you know if the yoga room has mommy &amp; me yoga? I&#039;d really like to do that in the neighborhood while I&#039;m on maternity leave (hm -- I&#039;ll just check their website :-)<br /><br />I second the movie advice -- I needed a day off today from baby prep (my mind is all tangled up with the 867 kinds of baby everything on the market) and it was GREAT to sit in a cool comfy theater seat &amp; be completely entertained &amp; absorbed for a couple of hours (I think the baby liked it too -- at least he was moving around a lot!). Refreshing &amp; fantastic.<br /><br />The only other piece of advice I can offer right now is that I&#039;ve been really glad I got some Patagonia camping/hiking undies last month. I got them for a trip to Utah where we did some hiking but they are perfect for summer in NYC too -- soft and completely comfortable and best of all moisture-wicking! (sorry if this is too much information. really these things are the best though.)<br /><br />anyway. hello again and glad to be here.<br /><br /><br />

				Congrats!<br /><br />Well I just wanted to say that when I became pregnant I was in the whole club/drinking scene and actually lost a few friends when i couldn&#039;t go out with them anymore. I now realize that they weren&#039;t &quot;friends&quot;. Maybe you can&#039;t do the things that you used to with your friends but that doesn&#039;t mean you can&#039;t spend time with them doing other things.<br /><br />But trust me when I tell you yes it will be hard and yes you will be tired for the next 20 years (ha ha) but no cocktail can compare, nothing in the world can compare, to the love you will feel for your child and having that child love you back. I work full time, have a 9 year old and a 2 year old. I still go out for dinner, drinks with friends at least once a month and still have &quot;date night&quot; with my husband at least once a month. Once a week we do something together as a family or with other friends and their kids.<br /><br />Most important, enjoy your pregnancy and enjoy your baby!<br /><br />Take care,<br />BL30<br /><br />P.S. If possible, try to push the baby out without getting an episiotomy (know I spelled this wrong). I had it with kid #1 and had such a terrible time with the healing afterward. With kid #2, I did without it, took my time pushing and was able to walk around and do things so much easier. Recoup was so much faster, easier to get through.<br /><br /><br />

				Hello all, I wanted to pop in and let everyone know that I am 5 months pregnant with my second BOY. I&#039;m very excited since my last pregnancy was 11 years ago, so I feel like I&#039;m doing this for the very first time. Most of my friends are single girls without children, so I really feel a need to connect with some moms, especially those that live close by. <br /><br />My due date is April 15th, yep, tax day. haha. Everything so far is going smoothly. The most difficult part was getting my Amnio done and the excruciating 2 week wait for the results. But everything came back good, no worries on that. Then yesterday I received my anatomy sonogram. My little one is now 14 ounces (no wonder I feel like I&#039;m going to tip over), and I even got to see his little hands and feet. He doesn&#039;t have cleft lip of palate (which was a huge concern since my husband has someone in the family that does).&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />I haven&#039;t felt him move yet, but I did see him move a lot in the sono. I&#039;m sure any week now I&#039;ll start to feel him nudge and kick. So, now I have to start to look to sign up for a lamaze class, since my husband wants to experience the class for himself. I have to also go register since my friends are pushing me to do so, so I have to schedule that in. <br /><br />I would love to meet up with expecting moms in the neighborhood. I currently live on 24th avenue in front of Astoria Park. Which is great because I am totally looking forward to the spring and pushing the baby around in the stroller on a nice day. Let me know if you have any weekend time, since I&#039;m still a full time working mom. I would love to chat about baby stuff, pregnancy stuff, husband stuff, and the dreaded nanny stuff, but never forgetting the &quot;me&quot; stuff either. <br /><br />Oh, my husband finally settled on a name (hopefully it&#039;ll stick all the way to april). We&#039;re planning on &quot;Cristian Reid&quot; (my son chose Reid). Apparently I&#039;m only birthing the child. hahaha. <br /><br />Hope to hear from anyone here. This is a great site and I love our neighborhood. I can&#039;t wait to raise my kids here. I can&#039;t wait to create memories here, make friends here and look back on the good times here.

				I go to Markouizos on Crescent between I think 27th and 28th. He&#039;s good and attentive, but loves to give referrals. I nurse (and still do at almostk 8 months) and he is receptive and encouraging, but not aggressive like some are with the nursing (i supplement with formula as I work full time). <br /><br />i chose him because my SIL went with her two children and was happy with him. Negatives are that parking is limited if you drive, but it is clean and I like the doctors.

				Seems that Astoria will have quite a few Spring babies coming in March and April. Congrats to all. Thanks Alexa for the pediatrician recommendation. Being new to Astoria, it was difficult deciding what doctor to take my 11 year old to, but I will definitely try out your doctor for my upcoming bundle of joy.<br /><br />Again, for all those that are presently expecting, especially those that are due in March/April, it would be great to get together and it would be nice to be able to have possible baby play dates once our little ones are here.<br /><br />
