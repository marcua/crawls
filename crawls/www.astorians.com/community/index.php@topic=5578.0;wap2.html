			Hello all!<br /><br />It is hard to gauge how many of us have children.<br /><br />I have an 18 month old daughter and while I am a member of a meetup group for astoria parents, this board seems a treasure trove of information about our neighborhood.<br /><br /><br />I would like to suggest we start a &quot;just for kids&quot; or &#039;families&quot; forum where we can discuss things specific to being parents and caretakers.&nbsp; &nbsp; It can also be a place where anyone can post events, organizations etc that would be specific to a groups of parents/caretakers and kids.<br /><br />The moderators have suggested I post this thread so they can see if this type of forum is needed.<br /><br />Thank you in advance for any responses.<br /><br />Have a great day!<br /><br />:) Jenny<br /><br />

			I think it&#039;s a great idea Jenny. If there&#039;s broad interest for it the moderators would be happy to consider the possibility. What does the rest of your Astoria parents Meetup group think about it? Please have them join the discussion.

			Great idea!<br /><br />I have a 3 year old and a 3 month old.&nbsp; Granted the 3 month old is too young but I would love to get my 3 yr old involved in a playgroup.&nbsp;
