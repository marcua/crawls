				So, I expect to be getting a lot of root veggies this winter with my CSA.&nbsp; In the past, they sometimes get dried out or soft sitting in the bottom drawer of my fridge.&nbsp; My understanding is that root vegetables are the kind of things that should last for a while, at least longer than I&#039;m experiencing.&nbsp; Is there anyway to store them so that they last longer?&nbsp; I do not have a root cellar or a potato bin.&nbsp; How do you store your root vegetables in a way to extend their life?

				I have the same issue, and I&#039;ve started to do some research on it.&nbsp; Unfortunately, most root vegetable storage information is geared for people who have things like basements, back yards and extra bedrooms.<br /><br />Here (http://www.backwoodshome.com/articles2/gist82.html)&#039;s an article that discusses ideal temperatures and locations for various root and winter vegetables - I think this is a good place to start because you might know of places in your apartment that can be adapted.<br /><br />This thread (http://www.city-data.com/forum/maine/195909-vegetable-storage.html) says to make sure to remove tops from things like carrots, as they will pull nutrients from the roots.<br /><br />Here (http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/06/garden/06root.html?pagewanted=all) is an article from the NY Times in November about people reinventing the root cellar in various spots around the city.&nbsp; Do you have any basement access?&nbsp; A box or Rubbermaid container down there might be an option if you do.<br /><br />We haven&#039;t really come up with a good option ourselves yet.&nbsp; We have a little cubby set in the wall below the window in the kitchen, but it&#039;s not big enough to store everything we will be getting.

				I put my carrots and beets if I won&#039;t be using them right away into the fridge veg. bin. They&#039;ve lasted without going soft for &#039;bout 3-4 weeks. And now, I know better than to keep onions and potatoes together as they will interact badly with one another, potatoes will soften, grow roots, etc... I now just keep the potatoes in a plastic bag and they&#039;re still with the onions, but at least not completely on top of one another. I know this doesn&#039;t help you, but as I have little space for a quantity of root vegetables nor the ability to try to use them up before they do go bad, I avoid getting the big bags of anything. While it might be cheaper (if you&#039;r&#039;e not doing the CSA) to get the bigger bags of potatoes, etc... in the end, it&#039;s far less wasteful (and less expensive after all) when I only buy the amount I&#039;m actually going to cook with and that might be 2-3 onions or potatoes every 2-3 weeks.

				Alton Brown says to keep those vegetable bins full of sand and plunge stuff like carrots into it. Seems drastic if the bins work fine on their own!

				Root veg -- beets, carrots, rutabega, parsnip, etc -- I store in large plastic bags with holes in them (just a few holes) in the fridge with the top twist tied.&nbsp; These guys need to keep some moisture content to avoid rubbery trapped in grossness.<br /><br />Potato and onion and garlic -- brown paper bags but separate brown paper bags for each sort.&nbsp; Potato likes it cold and dark.&nbsp; If exposed to light they will turn green and/or begin to sprout.&nbsp; Don&#039;t eat the green ones.&nbsp; If they do begin to grow eyes, you can snap the eyes out in the early stages and potato is still more or less edible.&nbsp; Find the coolest spot you&#039;ve got in your apartments and tuck the bulk away there (onion, potato, garlic).<br /><br />Onion needs to be warmer than potato but again, not overly warm.&nbsp; If they&#039;re going soft, dice and freeze.<br /><br />Cabbage can be kept much the same as root veg in fridge.&nbsp; Outer leaves will get gross but inner will be fine.<br /><br />Winter squash that&#039;s been properly cured will keep at room temp.&nbsp; Watch out for bruising and try to rest on soft surfaces.&nbsp; Eat the bruised ones first.<br /><br />Apples store in the fridge but separate the varieties as they off gas and may affect one another in flavor/time to decay.&nbsp; You can also cut up and freeze slices for later use in baked goods.<br /><br />And if your root veg isn&#039;t keeping well -- ferment it.&nbsp; Lacto fermented veggies are good.&nbsp; Kimchi is easy and there aren&#039;t rules so don&#039;t stick to standard cabbage ferments.&nbsp; Or roast and freeze if ferments are your thing.<br /><br />

				This has been a concern of mine also, because my apt is like a sauna.&nbsp; The house I grew up in had a crawl space, which was where my mom still keeps hers.&nbsp; (My grandmother, who lived with us, grew up in Ireland in the 1910s...if there&#039;s anything we know, it&#039;s potatoes.)<br /><br />I poked around the cabinets and closets to find the coolest spot, and realized that the cabinet under the kitchen sink is quite a bit cooler than the rest of the apt.&nbsp; We cleared all the cleaning products out, so that can be our mini root cellar.&nbsp; Earlier today, I checked on my sweet potatoes (stored in brown bags) from November, and they still look perfect!<br /><br />So basically, I&#039;m saying that Jayme&#039;s instructions are spot on.&nbsp; Good luck!<br /><br />

				Oh watch out on storing sweet potato.&nbsp; They aren&#039;t the best storage wise though I think their tolerance for storage may be partly varietal.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had a few batches rot on me fairly quickly and a few last months.&nbsp; Anyhow I just get a little heart broken when my sweet potatoes give up the ghost.<br /><br />-j

				Thanks for all this stuff! I&#039;ve got a load of roots coming this Thursday. I&#039;ll make sure to separate my potatoes from my onions, I never knew that before.
