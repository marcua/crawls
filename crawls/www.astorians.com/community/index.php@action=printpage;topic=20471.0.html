				ok I know this is old, but I have to chime in here. After being on the hunt for a burger close to In n Out in California for YEARS, Petey&#039;s nails it. For those not familiar with In N Out, this isnt huge thick juicy type of burger. Its a delicious different style all together. No, no one can actually duplicate In n Out in NYC despite how much we try because In n Out only opens restauraunts within a certain proximity to where they get their beef. BUT this is the closest I have tried. I had one yesterday and am craving again today. <br /><br />Yeay Petey&#039;s!

				Love Petey&#039;s.&nbsp; Just curious, do they have any off the menu options like animal style? Because that would ause me to schlep over there a lot more frequently.

				I will have to give Petey&#039;s a second try as I love In N Out. I went there once with the wife and we both thought the burgers were extraordinarily oily. Maybe it was a bad day.

				haa Im not sure if they have Animal style, but that would be really cool. I wonder what would happen if you walked up to the register at Petey&#039;s and was like &quot;Ill have a number 2. Animal style&quot; LMFAO. <br /><br />In N Out is sort of oily. I mean as fresh as they are they are considered drive through fast food.&nbsp;

				I enjoy Petey&#039;s and completely agree on the In-N-Out comparison.&nbsp; I was skeptical after hearing similar things about Five Guys, Blue9, etc.&nbsp; ,but Petey&#039;s is definitely In-N-Outs oily little brother.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Had a double cheeseburger at Petey&#039;s on Sunday...it was delicious. Frankly, I like it more than In-N-Out, which I know is blasphemy to West Coasters, but hey. Every time I go to Petey&#039;s I remark about how they give you way too many fries, and then I eat them all. :)

				Hello All,<br />&nbsp;<br />First let me start by saying thank you for all your support, love, and kind words of PETEY&#039;S BURGER.<br />I love checking in every now and then on Astorians.com just to make sure if there is any feedback that I may have missed.<br />Being born and raised an Astorian, this web site provides a great community service and proud to take part in anything we may be able to help the community with, just let me know.<br />&nbsp;<br />It’s because of the comments on this board, some 8 months ago I added the option of adding bacon to PETEY’S BURGER and I’m glad I Listened. As you know, my model of PETEY’S was in n out inspired, and in n out served no bacon, so PETEY’S is that much better<br />Thank you Astorians J .<br />&nbsp;<br />I also see where people have talked about Veggie burgers, we have three choices of homemade Veggie burgers Garden, Southwestern and Greek. Also people ask about delivery, we deliver pretty much to all of Astoria, you can call or order online at peteysburger.com it’s is the fastest way too order.<br />For the people who ask it would be great to get an animal style burger ala in n out, try our PETEY MELT, our quality beef with grilled onions, grilled bun, two slices of cheese ,our thousand island like sauce is perfectly melted together, just great.<br />Anyway, thanks for your time, any feedback,&nbsp; I will always be checking in on Astorians or just e-mail comment@peteysburger.com <br />Again, anything we can do to help with the community, Please just ask us.<br />Thank You<br />Peter “ PETEY HIMSELF”<br />&nbsp;

				I wish I could get a burger medium-rare instead of the standard medium. I really don&#039;t eat fast-food burgers much, but Petey&#039;s is quite good, and it&#039;s right near my girlfriend&#039;s place, so we&#039;d both definitely eat there once in a while ... but we just don&#039;t like burgers cooked to medium.<br /><br />Any chance of getting some pink in there?<br /><br />(Yes, I realize cook-to-order is uncommon in fast-food places, but Petey&#039;s strikes me as uncommon.)
