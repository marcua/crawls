				Sorry - I don&#39;t actually have a direct link to a clip, but rather to the article I read on CNN (http://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/TV/09/27/musharraf.dailyshow.ap/index.html) this morning. I&#39;m sure that this will (if not already) wind up on YouTube or Digg. The article was a great read, though, and made me audibly laugh in my cubicle. :)

My Pakistani friend from HS who lives in Pakistan/Canada actually likes him. She&#39;s quite an intelligent person and is quite even keeled. She mentioned to me once that Pakistan has grown considerably during his administration. Yes, as for D. Pearl, it was so tragic, and my feelings go out to Mirki2. But, we can&#39;t blame the sins of the few to one man. Afterall, he tried his very best to find D. Pearl.<br /><br />Also, in a way, overthrowing a government isn&#39;t bad all the time. Look at Marcos and the Philippines. He was overthrown by a coup/revoution and now the Philippines is much freer than it was under 12 years of martial law.<br /><br />I mean, the USA overthrew its colonial masters as wel, no?

				I am posting what one of my closest friends had to say about Musharraf. Following the start of this thread, I thought it would be worth it to add a Pakistani voice into the mix. Lost Moon, I know your friend actually likes the PM, but mine is very critical of him. Here&#39;s what he had to say:<br /><br />He&#39;s not a legitimate ruler. He came to power through a military coup. He has NO BALLS. He needs to repeal the Hudood and Zina ordinances. He wants to maintain his position of power. He has to placate the religious right in order to do this. Which sucks b/c he is actually moderate and centrist. I basically hate the man. I think he&#39;s such a redneck.<br />----- <br />Taimur Khan<br />Degree Candidate for Master of International Affairs, M.I.A.<br />&amp; Master of Science in Social Work, M.S.S.W.<br />Columbia University<br />School of Social Work<br />School of International and Public Affairs<br />Class of 2007

				Thanks Mirki for that. It&#39;s nice to hear another side of the story. <br /><br />Just as it is inevitable that the sun will rise tomorrow, it also bears true that some people will dislike Musharraf for sure. What I do know is good is his dedication to helping the U.S. fight terror. Ostensibly, that&#39;s his position anyway. <br /><br />As for coups, like I said, some people won&#39;t be happy, and some will be ecstatic. Personally, I&#39;ve been in four coups and one revolution. I can assure you that I would have been very unhappy if the four coups in the Philippines took place. We&#39;d all be commies by now. However, the revolution that started as a coup in 1986 was the best thing that came about for the Philippines. Ferdinand Marcos was ousted after 12 years of vicious martial law.<br /><br />And the coup that overthrew Joe Estrada a few years ago, was also a very good thing. However, it really shows how weak other Asian governments are as compared to the Western world. Mob-rule, rules. It&#39;s not a good exercise of the democratic process, but when the that itself is so heavily stained with graft and corruption, sometimes coups, revolutions, and stone throwing is all that people have.

Both countries have nuclear capability so you do want a moderate leader in place rather than a religious one. But Pakistan suffers from lack of progress in regard to government services. Just look at how Pakistan was ill-prepared for the devestating earthquake last year... and how dependent they were on foreign assistance on the one hand and how hesitant they were to accept that help initially.<br />It&#39;s good from a US perspective that Pakistan is cooperating with the US but it wasn&#39;t always so clear that that is where Pakistan is headed either. Nor is the US really doing such a good job in Afghanistan. Fact is, Bush diverted needed troops from Afghanistan to Iraq and you are now seeing a resurgence of Taliban in Afghanistan.

				Let&#39;s consider a hypothetical conversation going on in a cafe in Baghdad between two Iraqis who are members of the 65% of Baghdad residents who, according to the most recent polls, want the US out immediately.&nbsp; What has happened is that the US has withdrawn.&nbsp; The final troops have just flown out of the airport in Baghdad and Iraq is officially free of a US presence.&nbsp; How has this happened you ask?&nbsp; Well there has been a military coup.&nbsp; A group of US Generals had finally had enough of W sending troops wherever he wanted and they were putting an end to it.&nbsp; One of the Generals then declared himself President, for the good of the nation and to protect said nation from neo-con extremists of course.&nbsp; The new General/President then declared that there would be free elections.&nbsp; What he didn&#39;t say was that most of his opponents would be suppressed or arrested and that popular protest would be &quot;highly discouraged.&quot;&nbsp; Then surprise surprise he wins the next election with over 90% of the vote.<br /><br />Now our friends in the Baghdad cafe are good democrats and say that they definitely don&#39;t agree with a dictatorship, but they must admit that any semblance of a functioning democracy being crushed in the US is good for the Middle East.&nbsp; How would we feel about this?&nbsp; And if we wouldn&#39;t want a dictatorship here to prevent our extremist president from doing anything else crazy, then how can we just shrug and say, &quot;well, it&#39;s better than the alternative&quot; when it comes to another people&#39;s country?
