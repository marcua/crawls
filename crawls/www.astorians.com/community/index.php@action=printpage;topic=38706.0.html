				&quot;Space Available&quot;... Surprised it took THAT long. Been hanging around forever, and I have NEVER seen more than 3 tables in use at any one time. I can&#039;t believe that it couldn&#039;t even pick up the Kyclades overflow. Only ate there once right after it opened, and found it okay if a bit pricey at the time. Who knows, a ready made environment for another Artisanal branded organic gluten-free Hummus Tapas bar and bookstore

				Back, back in the day it was a Video Store.. then various different Meditteranean/French Seafood-esque restaurants owned by the same guy.&nbsp; I was surprised this one lasted as long as it did.. I always told people I thought it was a &#039;front&#039; for something.

				Yes!&nbsp; I lived in that video store as a child.&nbsp; Being that the same owner as the video store, Thanassis owned all the failed restaurants I&#039;m thinking he probably owns the building and doesn&#039;t have to worry about rent.&nbsp; Who knows!?

				The &#039;sad block&#039; reference...do you mean how that space next to Kyclades is it...?&nbsp; and maybe between that Co-op apt. bldg...how the street level storefront has been empty for a few years now?&nbsp; Yeah, it is really crappy looking...don&#039;t know what they could do to make it look better but some serious redesign seems to be in order...<br /><br />Anyway, I know it&#039;s no big loss with Okeanos, but what I fear is that it will be another new yuppie/hipster place.&nbsp; Granted, many of the new places that have opened are pretty good quality for the most part, but with each place closing, that&#039;s a little bit more of the old-school Astoria disappearing, and likely the LL will increase the rent for whomever the next tenant might be.<br /><br />There really needs to be a place in people&#039;s hearts and minds, for the old school diners (like on Steinway near 30th Ave) and on 31st Street near the Ditmars subway....for such places to remain...Oh...and Tasty&#039;s on Ditmars.&nbsp; I love the mix of the old and new in Astoria and would hate for it to continue at its current pace of gentrification.<br /><br />This is why it&#039;s so important to patronize the old school places!&nbsp; For e.g., the Bagel House&#039;s bagels are JUST as good as Brooklyn Bagel, yet all the hipsters go there instead.&nbsp; Why??

				Yippee, I&#039;m in agreement with a lot of this. But in answer to your last question (and I&#039;m not necessarily a fan of Brooklyn Bagel) -- having lived in Astoria for several years, I am grateful for some of the newer, albeit &#039;hipster-y&#039; places like 60 Beans or NY Bagel and Coffee. Mostly this is speaking as a freelancer who works from home and enjoys being able to grab a coffee, snack and sit somewhere for an hour for a change of pace. Before these places came along, I would often feel at odds trying to carve out a little (unobtrusive, not douche-baggy!) spot for myself amid the the gregarious European seniors (bless them) who frequent all the &#039;old-school&#039; places during the weekdays.<br /><br /><br />At times I feel very conflicted. The fancy-pantsness of all this new Astoria stuff is kinda out of control and I feel like it doesn&#039;t really target me as a normal person who&#039;s lived/worked hard in this city for so many years. Yet as much as I always admired the look/vibe of places like Lefkos Pirgos, never felt like I&#039;d be welcomed there. Still bummed to see that place leave and turn into a Time-Warner (?!!) store...

				Except that &quot;free&quot; wifi you&#039;re using in your hour isn&#039;t &quot;free&quot;. It&#039;s in the price of the $5 12oz coffee and $8 waffle or whatever.

				<br />Hey TJT...not sure if you were being facetious re: if they bring in Edison bulbs, etc., people (i.e,&nbsp; hipsters) might then start to go to The Bagel House?&nbsp; To me, the lack of nice, tasteful atmosphere IS the atmosphere.&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp; I mean, you gotta love that clearly old-school 40-something Italian guy who&#039;s sometimes behind the counter...I suspect he&#039;s part of the family who perhaps has owned that place for a while now?&nbsp; And I love the fact that their coffee isn&#039;t described as being &#039;free trade&#039; or &#039;roasted in small batches&#039; or anything.&nbsp; It&#039;s just ......&#039;kawrfee&#039;.&nbsp; ;-)

				Was totally joking.&nbsp; I sit there and eat my bagel and am as happy as can be.&nbsp; The bagels and their spreads are delicious - so that part was no joke.&nbsp; Actually, I also feel the same about the other old-school bagel shop on the other end of Ditmars.&nbsp; I&#039;d choose either over Brooklyn bagel.
