				I&#39;ve mentioned elsewhere that at Freeze Peach there used to be a box whether you could drop your stories off. You&#39;d sit down with a cup of tea, read everyone else&#39;s stuff, mark it up, and leave your own for someone else to mark up.

				I used to lead a writing group which the members are resuscitate. I kind of let die b\c people weren&#039;t really committed and just the differences in opinion and taste sort of drove people away. Ugh.<br /><br />That being said, I for one would definitely be interested in joining a new group, with new voices.

				You may indeed have to turn in your camp card if *that&#039;s* not clear...in this workshop, we have a great time chatting about everything in addition to sharing our stories composed on the spot, and the coffee table is jammed with delectable snacks, including fruit and cocktail weenies, a combo that always struck me as uniquely gay!

				I think 2-5 pages is really too short for any kind of workshop. I also think that limiting a group to memoir writing would probably mean missing out on some great works!<br /><br />The last workshop I ran met twice a month. We were limited to 3 mid-length poems/1 long poem or no more than 15 pages of prose. We would start off with a 10 minute free write before taking turns editing. the group had 8 people, including me, and it worked pretty well. We were all serious writers intent on publishing and it worked well. We talked about editing, but also about where to send work, what magazines fit other&#039;s styles, things like that. If anyone would be interested in a format like this, I could easily be persuaded to organize.

				I&#039;m not completely opposed to your ideas but I think a lot of us, myself included, are not professional writers.&nbsp; I have a full time career and work on my material in my spare time.&nbsp; And 15 pages is a lot to commit to.&nbsp; Also, I&#039;m personally looking for people concentrating in confidential memoir workshops in particular.&nbsp; So, I guess I actually would rather not be in the type of group your describing.&nbsp; But more power to you if anybody wants in on the super aggressive workshop you&#039;re suggesting.&nbsp; Otherwise, if anyone reading this post is working on memoir material and needs others for support, critique, and deadlines, you should PM me.

				I second silvermandj&#039;s suggestion for a group that focuses strictly on memoir related. As I understand it, this is what can also be described as &quot;creative non-fiction&quot; (or at least that&#039;s how the essay class I once took described it) and focuses on writing relatively short essays based on memory/experience and capturing your personal voice. <br /><br />I am also no where near a professional writer, but looking to get a group together to kick my ass into all the essays I&#039;ve started and not quite finished in the past few years.

				So ... is there a group anywhere?&nbsp; :-) I write nonfiction for a living (medical papers, newsletters) and fiction every other time. Not really ready to write my memoirs yet, but I&#039;d love to compare notes with other short story writers.<br /><br />I&#039;m not in Astoria yet! Next week though.

				Hey, all. I&#039;m a writer, publisher and editor of The Whiskey Dregs: Unplugged. We&#039;re doing a release party at Sparrow on Friday 5/2 at 9PM. I invite all writers and all creative types. We&#039;re providing a space for people to commune, have a beer, get a little wild and ultimately have some fun. <br /><br />I wrote a post earlier about this with more details.<br /><br />Sorry. Don&#039;t want to hijack this post but I think it&#039;s more or less what you guys might be looking for.
