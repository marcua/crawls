			Hello Astorians! I live in the Steinway Broadway area. I&#039;m temporarily getting a car for a week and would like to know the side street parking rules. The plate of the car is from NJ. I have parked outside of my house for a weekend with my dad&#039;s car from NJ and have not had any problem but I&#039;m not sure if I was just lucky. I don&#039;t want to be towed or ticketed overnight because the car is out of state? I do understand the cleaning street hours. I just want to know overnight rules?! If any? I would appreciate your help thanks!

			In state or out of state plates won&#039;t matter if the vehicle is parked illegally according to the alternate side parking signs. Overnight regulations are scarce in Astoria with the only one I know of to be on Shore Blvd. at Astoria Park.<br /><br /><br />If you still have any doubt feel free to check out the NYC 311 website linked below:<br /><br /><br />http://www1.nyc.gov/nyc-resources/service/2178/parking-signs-and-locator

			Yah, out of state doesn&#039;t matter. I had a car with Florida plates for a few years, parked curbside for part of that time. Never had trouble on account of the out of state plates (you see them all over the place, btw) though I got a couple of tickets for whatever parking sins I committed. <br /><br /><br />Just heed hours posted on the street-cleaning signs and don&#039;t block someone&#039;s driveway or park near a parking meter (unless you intend to feed it).<br /><br /><br />I think over your way there is at least one street with no side-of-street parking rules. 46th St.? I&#039;ve seen cars parked there for months, maybe years.<br /><br /><br /><br />I think the only plates that come with any immunity are Diplomatic Consular U.N. types.
