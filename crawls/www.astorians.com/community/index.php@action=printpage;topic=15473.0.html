				I haven&#039;t done much research on the candidates yet, but is there a reason why you&#039;re supporting Bill Thompson over Tony Avella, mcdirk? In the little I&#039;ve read about both of them so far, the worst thing about Avella seems to be his Julia Roberts lips (courtesy of Richard Simmons). Bill Thompson strikes me as more of a run-of-the-mill Democratic politician than Avella.

				I do agree that it&#039;s a hairline POV, but consider the other two candidates. Bloomberg, from their perspective, has been seen as presiding over the overdevelopment of the city, so he&#039;s automatically out. And between Thompson and Avella, Avella seems to be the only one actually concerned about irresponsible development and misuse of eminent domain. By default, Queens Crapper endorses him. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s fair to use that against him. It&#039;s not like he&#039;s going around saying &quot;Hey! Vote for me because I won the endorsement of the Queens Crap blog!&quot;

				I feel the same way, which is why I was wondering why mcdirk is already so comfortable with Thompson. It&#039;s too early for me to endorse anyone, but I&#039;m not going to write Avella (or anyone) off just because an angry Queens real estate blog supports him. You can&#039;t always choose your fans, and at this point he needs all the free publicity he can get since the others have millions/billions more dollars to spend.

				I know both Tony Avella and Bill Thompson very well personally and like them both as people. &nbsp;I&#039;ve actually given them both money in their bids for Mayor. &nbsp;I&#039;m backing Bill for a number of reasons. &nbsp;First, he&#039;s already a citywide elected official with the experience in managing city agencies - someone who could actually do the job of Mayor from day one. &nbsp;Tony has managed an 8 person city council staff, and while a smart man, and someone who is against development, has actually been one of the least effective members of the city council - he tends to take the right positions, but &nbsp;not play well with others, which while acceptable in an Executive position (for which he is running and for which he is much better suited than a legislative position, in which he currently serves), has made him pretty ineffective. &nbsp;I worry that Tony can not raise the money to get his message out, I don&#039;t think he has a citywide base to win either the primary or the election. &nbsp;Second, I trust Bill Thompson more than I do Tony or Mike - he&#039;s honest and he always works to do the right thing and achieve good results. &nbsp;He works with the Mayor when he has to in order to get results &nbsp;and with Speaker Quinn when he needs her help - he doesn&#039;t make his political opponents into enemies. &nbsp;Hope that helps.

				I know plenty of people who live in areas of Queens, the Bronx, and Brooklyn who do not live anywhere near public transportation and who are by no means wealthy.&nbsp; To imply that everyone that drives into the city is wealthy implies a lack of understanding of working class issues and I&#039;m surprised to hear this view at all.&nbsp; What a nonsensical statement.&nbsp; &nbsp;Having a car by no means means you&#039;re wealthy.&nbsp; Lots of time it is out of pure necessity.&nbsp; <br /><br />I do not know who I&#039;m voting for.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have much against Bloomberg but I don&#039;t have much for him either.&nbsp; I&#039;ll have to do some more research.&nbsp; I will say Bloomberg&#039;s constant flyer mailings are very annoying and a complete waste of trees and money.&nbsp; It&#039;s having the opposite effect on me than its intention.&nbsp; If he&#039;s so into Green, he wouldn&#039;t send these flyers out.&nbsp; I&#039;m not even a Republican and I&#039;m getting them!

				What neo11 said. <br /><br />Mayor&#039;s &quot;green&quot; initiatives = the color of money.<br /><br />And not everybody who owns a car is filthy-stinkin&#039; rich. The car I drive is considered &quot;totalled&quot; by the insurance company- after Mom got hit while driving it, she no longer wanted it. Runs just fine despite its crumpled exterior. I do a lot of out-of-town driving, and am a lowly city employee earning nearly half what I did when in the private sector. I avoid driving into NYC for the most part- no reason to do so (too much aggrivation.)<br /><br />While I endorse bicyclist and pedestrian rights, I can&#039;t agree with the East River tolls. Just more &quot;green&quot; for the Mayor&#039;s pockets. His desperation to make this happen makes me highly suspicious of his true interest. <br /><br />I heard that the Naked Cowboy is running for mayor {{{{sigh}}}} I should hope more alternatives throw their hats in the ring.<br /><br />

Or let someone else pick. Or maybe govt. management is fine enough that you are comfortable to simply let others vote.<br /><br />As one Libertarian/independent/city voter, I am looking at this primary as a referendum on the city Democratic party. If you care about your nominees, then I might too. If you dont, why should I?<br /><br />I ask members of major parties to consider all the candidates available on the ballot. So, I also consider the major party candidates as well.<br />Soon enough, we will see who are the nominees for the general election. <br /><br />Voters have choices.

				I watched the debates leading up to this, and most of the candidates seemed like your typical politician. The ones that didn&#039;t clearly had no chance of winning. I voted for the ones who didn&#039;t have a chance, mostly because they were different, not because I thought they were awesome.

				I think the results yesterday were very interesting.&nbsp; Queens now will have two openly gay Councilmembers - Daniel Dromm and Jimmy Van Bramer.&nbsp; My candidate, Mark Weprin, won with over 50% of the vote.&nbsp; Turnout was very low - we had expected at least 10,000 and only got around 9,000 voters.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thompson is a good man and the Mayoral race will tighten as people get to know him. Can his honesty, hard work and message overcome Bloomberg&#039;s billions?&nbsp; I don&#039;t know - but we&#039;ll find out soon enough.<br /><br />I backed David Weprin, but I am a huge John Liu fan.&nbsp; I know John very well and he is a good friend.&nbsp; While the Daily News has attacked him on the sweatshop story, I believe him and think that he will make an outstanding Comptroller.&nbsp; I look forward to voting for him in the run-off.<br /><br />While our own Eric Gioia did make the run-off, he ran a strong campaign and organized a lot of new voices for the Democratic party.&nbsp; He&#039;ll be back - Congrats to him for his new baby!&nbsp; I did not expect Bill DeBlasio to do better than Gioia, but he ran an amazing campaign.&nbsp; I was incredibly impressed - Bill is what everyone hopes to find in an elected official.&nbsp; He is smart, creative, personable and just one dedicated public servant.&nbsp; Mark Green, who also made the run-off is also very smart - he achieved a lot and did provocative reports when he was previously Public Advocate.&nbsp; While I still do not get why he would ever want to come back, if elected, he would also be a good choice.&nbsp;

				When known, Id like to know what are the runoff races. And what are the recommendations for the candidates.<br />Saw some of the debates for Advocate and all the candidates came off pretty well to me. <br />The Controller race is a bit more interesting.<br /><br />Are there any runoffs for any Council districts?<br /><br />I was glad to see some Council incumbents will be finding new work.<br /><br />It has been some time since NY has had a Democratic mayor. Do you believe Thompson would do a fine job, or one as well as the mayor?<br />I like Thompson&#039;s resume. I&#039;d like to see if he has any meaningful private sector experience.<br />Is it silly to hope for any taxpayer relief? Better budget management?<br /><br /><br />http://www.thompson2009.com/<br /><br /><br />___<br />ps sorry to see Siegal and Gioia could not make it further<br /><br /><br />

				I hope voters vote, and vote their best hopes. I would love to have renewed faith in our voters and our election system.<br /><br />As one wanting to see less govt, less spending/debt/taxes, integrity and transparency, it seems ever appropriate that election day comes so soon after Halloween.<br /><br />If I were voting the straight LBT ticket, it would be<br /><br />- Dobrian for mayor<br />- Lesczynski for advocate<br />- Clifton for comptroller<br /><br />All have been on the balllot before. All have supported LBT principles for many years. I am thankful to have the option to vote for them this election.<br /><br />I have noted, for me, the best match of office/agenda/person is Lesczynski.<br /><br />I dont often take an interest in the primaries of other parties. But I am comfortable still with Liu for the office of comptroller.<br /><br />There are thankfully many possibilities on the ballot. I find choosing a candidate for mayor is difficult, but I will have peace in voting for Thompson. <br />I hope voters take their choice and what it means seriously.<br /><br />Whatever the results on election night, we all should hope the next 4 years bring wide prosperity, better schooling, safe and peaceful streets, vibrant communities, and more.<br /><br />Peace.<br />&nbsp;:-)

A federal court sentenced his father for his embezzlements of bank deposits from ethnic Chinese customers right after John Liu was elected as the councilman of New York City.&nbsp; Liu was very upset and discontent toward the American political and social systems. He developed hatred towards American government and people since then.&nbsp; In contrast, the Communist regime from China has not give him any help during his growing up, why did he actively collude with the communist regime from China and say all good words about the regime? That is because the communist regime has always taken the United States as its main enemy in the last 60 years, the regime’s military developments has also targeted on the United States, the oversea website of the regime even openly threatened to bomb four million New Yorkers by PLA (the People’s Liberation Army) bombers.&nbsp; The reason why John Liu supports the communist regime is to hope that the regime become stronger and stronger and one day it will bring destructive blow out onto American people.&nbsp; Because of this, John Liu did not give any praises towards the American systems but praised the communist dictatorship in China; because of this, he refused to offer help to a mother of two American soldiers fighting for the country in Iraq, yet he went to the communist consulate three times to&nbsp; convey the congratulatory plaques for the launches of communist military satellites; and because of this he never condemned the terrorist attacks on this country yet he called American government terrorism (on local Chinese language media) when a pregnant illegal Chinese immigrant had a miscarriage while being deported by the US government.<br /><br />If we can’t stop him, his actions of this hatred will become intensified.&nbsp; For the sake of our families, our parents and children and all American people, we must united and say NO to John Liu.<br /><br />The Communist regime, with which John Liu has been colluding, has never been lenient.&nbsp; It has caused at least 80 million unnatural death among Chinese people during its ruling in Mainland China.&nbsp; Now it has established heavy infiltration in the United States.&nbsp; It has invested a huge amount of money in developing its organizations in this country. According to the reliable resource, there are 360 all different pro-communist organizations in New York alone.&nbsp; The number of Chinese people that are controlled or manipulated by the communist consulates has reach 300,000.&nbsp; Two out of three Chinese you see in New York.&nbsp; What’s the reason behind their endless effort in incorporating, organizing and controlling the oversea Chinese? According to reliable information source, these oversea Chinese will be used by the communist regime to strike on this country in for situations: <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;1. When the CCP gives the command to strike against the United States<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;2. When a war breaks out between Communist China and the US,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;3. When the States encounters strikes from outside and the whole states becomes weak and<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;4. When the Communist regime is collapsing via Chinese people’s overthrowing effects.&nbsp; <br /><br />The more terrifying situation is that these oversea Chinese are required by the regime to take actions to strike against the States voluntarily when there cannot get instructions at all.&nbsp; &nbsp;Because of the huge number of them, even one percent of them start the striking actions onto the States, that would be 3000 people in them and then the destructions would be enormous (comparing to only 22 terrorist involved in 911 attacks). <br /><br />John Liu knows these things and would like to get hold of more power and use it to cover up the communist regime’s intentions and in the mean time to entice more Chinese in this country become anti-American.&nbsp; Next time the real terrorist attacks will be from those Chinese living in this country and controlled by the communist regime if we want life continue in the way we want, we must stop John Liu and the Communist regime from infiltrating this country. <br /><br />Please tell this message to as many people as you can.<br /><br />Thank you. <br /><br />October 13, 2009<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Who knew!&nbsp; :lol:

[?]<br /><br />In related news, the Aspen (Colorado) Times has this editorial in favor of retaining Instant Runoff Voting in that city.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=15473.msg181979.html#msg181979">Quote from: TRX on October 01, 2009, 05:25:24 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Instant<br />Runoff<br />Voting<br /><br />http://www.fairvote.org/irv/<br /><br />A great piece:<br /><br /><br />Read more: <br />http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/<br /><br />http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2009/09/29/2009-09-29_serpe_scrap_the_runoff_system_.html<br /><br /><br /><br />Serpe is former deputy director of the Political Reform Program of the <br />New America Foundation and was a senior analyst for FairVote. <br />She is currently running for City Council in Queens&#039; District 22.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				So much closer in the Mayoral race than expected.&nbsp; If only Thompson had won - he is such a good man and would have been an amazing Mayor.&nbsp; I was shocked by all the negative ads by Bloomberg trashing Bill Thompson - shocked and offended.&nbsp; He could have just run positive ads touting his record, which has a number of accomplishments - he did not need to slander someone.<br /><br />I am sad to see the loss by the two Democratic Asian council candidates, Yen Chou and Kevin Kim.&nbsp; I know them both well and was looking forward to seeing them in the Council.&nbsp;
