				Surf Astoria is a new Internet Cafe right off of the Ditmars N/W stop in Queens. If you&#039;re looking for a great place to use the internet by renting one of our PCs or using our free WiFi, get some work done away from home, print/scan/copy/fax, hold group meet ups, hold an event, or just try some awesome teas, then come on over. We&#039;re open 10 to 10 everyday! <br /><br />We need your support and we&#039;re really interested in improving your community with this establishment, so come in with ideas for us too!<br /><br />www.surfastoria.com<br /><br />Hope to see you soon!<br /><br />Brad<br />Assistant Managet

				Do you have anything to do with the old Freeze Peach cafe? Some of the stuff on your website seems like it was lifted from theirs.

Do you serve regular drip coffee as well as flavored espresso-based drinks? Your menu only lists teas. (I&#039;ll check out the place myself sometime, but I&#039;m not near Ditmars anymore so it would be cool to know ahead of time.)

				do you have air conditioning yet? And is the music still&nbsp; horribly loud? Because it was the least pleasant place when I was there a few weeks ago. <br /><br />

Not sure what day you were in, but I think you&#039;ll find the music is a pretty reasonable volume as well. (We&#039;re also neighbors to an amazing yoga studio - The Giving Tree so we make sure to be quiet enough for them to meditate and all that good stuff.) Always feel free to let us know if you think we should turn it up or down, we&#039;re always happy to accomodate our neighbors (and we have headphones at all our computers if you&#039;d like to listen to something else).<br /><br />best,<br />Matt
