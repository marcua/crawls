				I can&#039;t remember ever not voting in an election since I became eligible to vote, but I just don&#039;t know anything about today&#039;s election.&nbsp; Where can I read anything about our local ballot, and about our choices?&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t look like there&#039;s been any discussion of it here on this website.

				2006 is an off year for NYC and NY State.&nbsp; In Queens, elections are being held for the following positions:<br /><br />Justice of the Supreme Court (court of general jurisdiction, not the high court of the state)<br />Judge of Civil Court - County<br />Judge of Civil Court - District<br />District Attorney<br /><br />As is true throughout NYC, candidates for these positions are heavily controlled by the party machinery, and many candidates are running on most or all party lines.&nbsp; The District Attorney candidate is Richard Brown, the long-time (since 1991) and current DA for Queens, and he is running unopposed and on three party lines -- Democrat, Republican and Conservative.<br /><br />There is one ballot proposal for an amendment to the NY State Constitution - something about providing an acre of forest preserve land for drinking water for a town in exchange for 12 acres somewhere else.<br /><br />There is more information here (http://vote.nyc.ny.us/candidateslist.html), from the NYC Board of Elections.

				We have contested elections today for three Supreme Court seats for Queens County.&nbsp; The Republicans nominated three candidates, all non-judges and the Democrats are putting up three sitting Civil Court judges.&nbsp; It is important to get out and vote today.&nbsp; Polls are open until 9 p.m.

				I really don&#039;t think they do a go a good job at showing the proposal in the voting machine.&nbsp; With only a few things to vote for, and a hugely blank slate, I do not think people will see things down at the bottom.&nbsp; They should say something or have something up around saying don&#039;t forget to mark a vote for/against &quot;Proposal ____&quot;.

				Thanks everyone - this is a great site.<br /><br />Wow, that was kind of kooky fun, at , my polling place at PS 85.&nbsp; Boy did they get confused about what to do with us when we showed up.&nbsp; Very sweet, but a littled befuddled.&nbsp; <br /><br />And that antique voting apparatus.&nbsp; Fascinating.

All you need to do is serve 3â€“4 terms in either the State Senate, State Assembly or City Council from Astoria. It&#039;s been a ritual since Thomas LaFauci retired from the Assembly as our elected official in the late 1950s.

				This is actually the son of the former Assemblymember, another NYC ritual, dynastic politics (though sometimes you get good results - i.e. the Vallones, the Weprins)
