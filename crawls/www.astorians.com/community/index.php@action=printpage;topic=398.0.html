				We just went to El Boqueron. It was a bit formal, but very tasty. What do you all think about it?

				We went to El Boqueron a couple of years ago and quite enjoyed it. &nbsp;I'm pretty sure we had the octopus and found it very good, but time has blurred my memory as to the other dishes. &nbsp;Keep meaning to go back but havne't got around to it somehow.<br /><br />ok - here's what I wrote for another website back when we went in Dec. 2002 (a little longer than I remembered):<br /><br /><em>We started with serrano and manchego cheese tapas - both good. However, the best by far was the &quot;baby squid in a mildly spicy garlic sauce.&quot; The squid was cooked just right - just chewy enough, and the sauce was wonderful, slightly spicy, with lots of lightly caramelized garlic slices. Medallions of lamb were also very good, very tender, with a nice sauce. Sweetbreads were cooked really nicely, crispy and sweet on the outside and soft inside, although the dish was a little too salty for my taste. The only real disappointment was the scallops in asparagus sauce. The scallops were not very fresh, and my husband likened the sauce to Campbell's cream of chicken soup.<br />&nbsp;<br />Service was attentive, although they pushed the Pellegrino a little too much - 3 times. Unfortunately, we had no room whatsoever for dessert.</em>

				I absolutely love El Boqueron. Definitly one of my all-time Astoria favorites. The atmosphere there can seem a bit formal, but they are very friendly. I've popped in for a casual bite many times. I brought a group of 10 there for my birthday and the service was wonderful.<br /><br />I've tried many (if not most) of the tapas by now, and the baby squid in garlic sauce and lamb are among my favorites. And should you still have room for dessert, they have a very nice mocha flan--very silky &amp; creamy.<br /><br />Don't forget the sangria! :-)

				I'm a frequent visitor to Astoria, posting here for the first time, and before I say anything else, I just gotta say ... <br /><br />... I LOVE El Boqueron, and so do most people I know who have ever been there.<br /><br />And it's not just because it starts with &quot;El&quot; or serves awesome squid (in garlic sauce)!<br /><br />My sister, who has traveled and dined extensively in Iberia and South America, and who lives 2,000 miles from here, says it's her favorite restaurant IN THE WORLD, and insists on eating there every time she is in New York.<br /><br />My friends and I -- including artgirl, whom I always seem to sit next to there, for some reason :) -- love the squid, the quail with fruit sauce, the scallop and asparagus dish, the gazpacho with a hint of cream, the chorizo, the sangria, the mocha flan ... I've never had anything less than very good, and most things are great. And the staff treats us like Castillian royalty.<br /><br />Drop what you are doing and hie thee thither.

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">is it pricey?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It depends... it can be pricey if you go all out with pitchers of sangria and coffee &amp; dessert, but I sometimes go just for a simple meal, when I really need an El Boqueron fix and don't have a lot of dough. That's the great thing about tapas... you can order as much or as little as you want, without feeling like you have to commit to an extravagent meal.<br /><br />The tapas run an average of $8-9 each, and one can make a meal out of 2 of them. (I find it to be just the right amount for me-- and even when I go with other people and share, we end up ordering 2 per person)<br /><br />I've had a meal of 2 tapas and a glass of wine, and the check came out around $25. Which, I think given the quality of food there is a great deal.<br /><br />If nothing else, go sit at the bar &amp; have a drink and order the squid in garlic sauce. You won't be disappointed!
