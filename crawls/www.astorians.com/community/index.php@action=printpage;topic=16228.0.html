				{{{sigh}}} yeah saw that too. Just means same thing, more money.<br /><br />The new gourmet produce market stand (whatever it is) on Ditmars is pretty annoying, as it reflects the trendiness now taking over. <br /><br />Seems like there&#039;s no middle ground: It&#039;s either a 99 cent store, crappy bodega, or Whole Foods-wanna-be or sushi restaurant.

				I will continue to buy my produce at Best Yet and only occasionally at the Korean owned vegetable stand on 31 St. <br /><br />Someone mentioned they were hoping for a Trader Joe&#039;s to open in the TT space. Last weekend we discovered a Trader Joe&#039;s in Cobble Hill on Atlantic Avenue. The place was awesome. I said &quot;This building is huge! Must&#039;ve been a bank at one time!&quot; Well, duh... <br />&quot;The 14,000-square-food trail mix peddler occupies an old bank built in 1923—a time when banks were constructed like ornate fortresses, proven by the structure’s dramatic arched windows and 30-foot ceiling.&quot;<br /><br />http://newyork.metromix.com/restaurants/restaurant/trader-joes-cobble-hill/265707/content<br />

				Hopefully this place will be good, I&#039;ll wait and see what it&#039;s like before I make any judgements. <br /><br />I don&#039;t see what&#039;s so wrong about that market on 31st street. They do have the best prices for organic milk and eggs in the hood, which is a huge plus for me.

				I hope the &quot;Farmers&quot; in Astoria Farmers Market has more basis in reality than &quot;Organic&quot; does in Greenline Organic.&nbsp; Greenline&#039;s organic produce selection is quite small (although they do carry a lot of organic processed products).&nbsp; It would be great if the new place sells produce and products from actual farmers (and hey, local, while they&#039;re at it), rather than agribusiness.

				I&#039;ll be happy with a regular old fruit and vegetable stand with regular FRESH fruits and vegetables. It would be nice just to buy romaine lettuce and cilantro that&#039;s not old and yellow, chestnuts not from last year, and not overpriced peaches in the summer that are mealy and tasteless. I&#039;ll gladly buy baking potatoes grown in Idaho and oranges from Florida. I&#039;d rather buy U.S. grown garlic-not from China (God knows what those bulbs absorbed 9 months in the ground over there), although the Chinatowns in Manhattan and Flushing have good produce.<br /><br />I&#039;m a bit skeptical about a &quot;Farmer&#039;s Market&quot; in Astoria. Maybe it&#039;s just a gimmick. A ruse to over-charge the naïve (new) Astorians? We&#039;ll see.

				I suppose you could call me one. A micro-farmer I suppose. I&#039;ve been blessed to have access to a backyard. I grow garlic (hardneck variety-close to a hundred this year), tomatoes, Japanese eggplant, mustard greens, swiss chard, parsley, cilantro, Japanese sweet peppers, orange bell peppers, serrano peppers, Japanese cucumbers, 2 fig trees (white and purple), a handful of blueberries from my dwarf blueberry bush, and lots of flowers. All organic by the way. Unfortunately, I don&#039;t grow enough to actually sell, but continually harvested enough to keep the family healthy and happy this summer.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure there are many &quot;farmers&quot; in Astoria.

				Local farmers meaning farmers in Jersey and southern NY State with small farms rather than giant industrial farms. There is also an urban farming movement afoot in NYC. There is rooftop farms in Brooklyn that grows all kinds of produce on rooftops in Greenpoint and sells them at farmers markets and to local restaurants. The local farms are mainly organic and don&#039;t use pesticides in their growing much of the time and grow fresh, seasonal ingredients that don&#039;t get shipped for thousands of miles and use fossil fuels to ship them. It&#039;s called the slow food movement or ethical consumerism.

				I am sceptical that &quot;Astoria Farmer&#039;s Market&quot; will be anything like the Greenmarkets around the city. Sounds like another fruit and veg market, not organic and not locally grown by all the Astoria&nbsp; micro-farms, Brooklyn rooftop farms and small farms in Jersey and southern NY.

				In light of the news story- I find it EXTREMELY odd that Top Tomato was chased out for &#039;rent&#039; issues. Obviously something else was involved. Even the owners of the Acropolis can&#039;t be THAT stupid. By now, The Acropolis should have been paying HIM to keep the store there.

				The farmer&#039;s market will open this Wednesday (12/02). I heard the owner say it. And no, not the same owners as Greenline. These people are Pakistani, Greenline is owned by Turks. This place looks much better than TT. TT was a place to pick up the cucarachas with your bananas. I never got a fresh piece of produce from TT EVER....and that&#039;s why they went out of business. No way to pay the rent when you&#039;re not making any money coz no one will go to your rotten tomato store!

				Funny, all these years and I never had a problem with TT. Bananas were among the &quot;cleanest&quot; (not sticky like in Key Food, that came with gnats); and the occasional old-looking produce was at a minimum. Whereas at markets like Berry Fresh, I&#039;m amazed anybody goes in there for produce at all.<br /><br />Shame that it was mafia-owned. Surprising that they couldn&#039;t keep it open- since when does the mob have to relocate due to high rent?! If mob revenue is down, however, I suppose THAT is a GOOD thing!! :mrgreen:

				I rarely, if ever, had a problem with Top Tomato produce over the years.&nbsp; It&#039;s a moot point, though, and I doubt the quality of their produce had anything to do with why they closed.<br /><br />I saw boxes of vegetables being delivered to the new space this morning.&nbsp; Most of the boxes on the pallet were labelled &quot;organic&quot;; however, the ones I could identify as I walked by were from California, Oregon or Washington (and a few labelled &quot;Pacific&quot;).&nbsp; I hope to see that they will carry at least some local produce as well, but I didn&#039;t see any this morning.

				A little bit off topic, but this week&#039;s This American Life (http://www.thisamericanlife.org)&nbsp; had a story about the North East&#039;s main produce market - where all buying and selling of produce for this region&#039;s restaurants, markets, grocery stores happens.&nbsp; It was pretty fascinating.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the description:<br /><br />Act One.

The local farms are mainly organic and don&#039;t use pesticides in their growing much of the time and grow fresh, seasonal ingredients that don&#039;t get shipped for thousands of miles and use fossil fuels to ship them.

				I just came from there.&nbsp; If you&#039;re looking for organic, local produce, go to Union Square.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t exist in Astoria.&nbsp; The produce is ok, nothing special.&nbsp; Similar to what was there before.&nbsp; The prices are average, and some are not a bargain at all.&nbsp; $2.25 for tomatoes on the vine, and $1.99 for grapes, yet $.49 for red onions, .79 for brown potatoes.&nbsp; 5 for a dollar lemons.&nbsp; The lettuce was all droopy though.&nbsp; Does anyone ever have nice lettuce around here???&nbsp; It&#039;s nice to have another option though, and they have a lot of space now.&nbsp; They&#039;ve made better use of it, and the place looks really nice.&nbsp; They&#039;re not finished stocking up or setting up yet, but they were doing a brisk business when I stopped by.&nbsp; <br /><br />I took a picture and will upload it in a little bit.&nbsp;

				Thanks, gals. Yeah, that&#039;s what the sign says, but it&#039;s not set up yet.&nbsp; There&#039;s a lot of unused space in there, I assume because things haven&#039;t arrived yet.&nbsp; Perhaps it will go over to the right side.&nbsp; They redid the whole place.&nbsp; Much nicer.

				This afternoon, I stopped by Astoria &quot;Farmers&quot; Market with the intention to buy some vegetables for the first time, since sadly the CSA season has ended until next spring.&nbsp; I was so disheartened by what I found.&nbsp; I was specifically looking for seasonal veggies, although I didn&#039;t expect to find local or organic necessarily.&nbsp; I wanted root vegetables, winter squash, cabbages - that sort of thing.<br /><br />In the refrigerated case near the entrance closest to 35th St., where I had noticed some organic items being displayed when they first opened, I saw only a random assortment of non-organic fruit and vegetables, including slimy-looking mushrooms, brussels sprouts, and California strawberries.&nbsp; In another section, all of their herb bunches were wrapped in plastic - so not only could I not check the quality, but plastic spurs spoilage for sensitive leaves like that.&nbsp; Aside from generic green cabbage, they had Napa cabbage that was also wrapped in plastic.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t find any parsnips or rutabaga.&nbsp; The cauliflower was gross - they had both white and purple, but all of the heads were turning black, and on closer inspection, nearly all of the heads had already been scraped - which means that the store had already scraped off one layer of spoilage and put them back out for sale.&nbsp; At that point I turned and walked out - and went to Trade Fair and got everything I was looking for, all of it fresh looking.&nbsp; I never thought I&#039;d prefer Trade Fair to a vegetable stand, but today it was sure better.<br /><br />Has anyone else shopped there, and if so, did you have a better experience?&nbsp; I&#039;d like to think it can and will be better than this, even if it isn&#039;t ever a true farmers market, but today was a very poor shopping experience there.

				I bought a couple things there the other day (potatoes, carrots, and garlic). The cashiers were very nice, and they take debit! (Not sure about credit, I didn&#039;t ask.) This is good for me, since I would usually have to go to the ATM if I wanted to go to Top Tomato - they were cash only. If you do need to get cash, AFM has a 99c ATM, better than all the delis &amp; other banks in the area. (I bank with a small credit union in CT, so I&#039;m always looking for the cheapest ATMs, or I get cash back at the drugstore.)<br /><br />As Daisy said, the prices were ok, and they didn&#039;t seem to have a ton of stuff yet. They do have a bigger grocery/non produce area than TT had, which I liked.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t notice any *really* gross stuff like lanseaux, but I wasn&#039;t looking terribly hard. I was looking for parsnips, which they didn&#039;t have. (Anyone know where I can get them around here?)
