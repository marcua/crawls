				Jonathan knocks on the neighbor&#039;s door.&nbsp; He can hear them inside whispering and shuffling around.&nbsp; He knocks again.&nbsp; They say &quot;who is it?&#039;&nbsp; He says - &quot;Jonathan from downstairs.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;No response.&nbsp; Still whispering and they turn off the music.&nbsp; But they don&#039;t open the door.&nbsp; <br /><br />Jonathan comes back in - he&#039;s baffled.&nbsp; The neighbors won&#039;t open the door.&nbsp; <br /><br />15 min later - there&#039;s cop cars out front - cops jumping the fence - cops coming in the front door.&nbsp; &quot;do you have a roof?&quot;&nbsp; &quot;how do we get to your roof?&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />Apparently - unused to friendly neighbors bearing home baked goods - the upstairs folk called the cops b/c there was a man at their door (or was he on the fire escape?&nbsp; as they reported).&nbsp; <br />

				Another reason not to bring your neighbor a pie is he may be diabetic and drop dead from the sugar and then you&#039;d be doing 10-20 for manslaughter. But, it&#039;s the thought that counts.&nbsp; &nbsp;:killme:

				OK, Yes I still brought them the dessert.&nbsp; They were mortified and embarrassed.&nbsp; New to the neighborhood and had heard about the break-ins in the neighborhood.&nbsp; Also a bit stupid.&nbsp; They couldn&#039;t figure out if it was a guy at the door or a guy on the fire escape.<br /><br />About 8 cops showed up.&nbsp; When they found out what was up they wanted dessert too. <br /><br />Next time I practice my baking skills I will bring my results elsewhere. Definitely one of the oddest moments in my life.

				When I moved into my house I was alone and nobody brought me a pie, but one of my neighbors came over drunk and told me he could get into my house if he wanted to.

				When I first met Jim, his neighbours would often give him tasty homecooked Sicilian dishes.&nbsp; After some months, I hesitantly began occasionally offering them some things in return (once I gave them sticky buns.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; I don&#039;t know - I had never made sticky buns before, and haven&#039;t made them since).<br /><br />Years later we discovered that they had told all the neighbours that Jim refused to buy food or cook for himself and had &quot;forced&quot; them to give him food so he wouldn&#039;t go hungry.<br /><br />C&#039;mon, if you&#039;re going to make up a story, at least make it good.
