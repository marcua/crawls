				Maybe there&#039;s a better message board to ask these questions - there don&#039;t seem to be too many parents here but I&#039;ll give it a shot - please let me know where else I can ask around.<br /><br />Questions:<br /><br />How did you handle child care?&nbsp; Who stayed home?&nbsp; For how long?&nbsp; How did you find someone to take care of your baby?&nbsp; How far in advance did you line up child care?&nbsp; Can you recommend anyone in Astoria - specifically near 30th ave/Steinway corridors?&nbsp; <br /><br />We&#039;re due in Aug.&nbsp; The plan is that I will take off a semester from work (school) in the fall/winter.&nbsp; After that... we&#039;re not sure.&nbsp; My husband is self employed and doesn&#039;t have regular work hours.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure if you can arrange day care on a &quot;by need&quot; basis.&nbsp; There could be days where we don&#039;t need any help - but others where we need 8-10 hours.&nbsp; The problem is we often don&#039;t know his schedule until the day before.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I think it is hard to do this without knowing what kind of schedule you will have. I will be working it out with my husband as we are both professors and have some flexibility in our work schedules, but I know that the day cares around here have notoriously had wait lists and limited availability. You should definitely start looking now. <br /><br />Sorry I can&#039;t be of more help.

				What about finding a family to share a nanny with, maybe dropping off the kid with a nanny who&#039;s already taking care of someone&#039;s child, or another family who&#039;s got a nanny coming to them?&nbsp;

				that&#039;s the age old question, isn&#039;t it?&nbsp; if you hire a sitter to cover YOUR schedule, you will have to hire her for hours that your husband may be able to cover instead- and then you might feel like you are &quot;wasting&quot; money.&nbsp; Though, if you do- then your husband could take some of those hours to clean the house, shop, cook, etc without a baby to watch- and that might be really nice.<br /><br />You might find a family that would be willing to &quot;share&quot; the sitter with you- especially good if they have a full time sitter and you would share on an &quot;as needed&quot; basis (maybe agreeing to &quot;sharing&quot; for a set number of hours per week- and if they are very flexilble, maybe per month so that during busy weeks for your husband, you could use your surplus hours, and in less busy weeks, you could rack up hours as your husband would be home).&nbsp; <br /><br />If you are hiring a sitter, regardless, they are counting on your money, too.&nbsp; So, even if you are on vacation, you still pay them- if you stay home because you are sick (or your kid is sick- more often), you still pay, etc.&nbsp; At least- that was how it was when i had a full time sitter.&nbsp; And in a share, the sitter will agree to do it because they will make more money during the &quot;share&quot; part- and will probably count on that money, too.<br /><br />I have done a share, and it can be great!&nbsp; I have also had my own sitter who came to my house, and that was great too!&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Sitters in astoria usually charge 10-14, and a share is usually 16-20 per hour.&nbsp; some sitters prefer a &quot;per week&quot; minimum.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now I use daycare- I have a soon to be 4 year old and a soon to be 1 year old.&nbsp; It ended up being cheaper for us (and now that my older kid needs the school/socialization it makes more sense for us).&nbsp; Day care is 1000-1600 for an infant (some daycare centers start at 6 months).&nbsp; 18months and up is 800+.<br /><br />here&#039;s some of the daycare places in astoria (a bunch of moms gave info about their daycare choices- taken from the Astoria mom meetup site) <br /><br />All Children&#039;s Child Care- Bright Beginnings Preschool<br />(718) 707-0501 <br />3501 24th St<br />Long Island City, NY 11106<br />other locations in Astoria and Woodside- they are building a new site on 31st ave/32nd st)<br /><br />Odyssey Learning Daycare<br />http://www.astoriaday... <br />Phone: (718) 956-5390<br /><br />Carolyn&#039;s Playhouse<br />10-42 Jackson Avenue<br />LIC, NY<br />917-324-2862<br />http://www.carolynspl...<br /><br />Diki Daycare<br />31-24 38th Street<br />Astoria, NY 11103<br />(718) 278-1033<br /><br />&quot;Perfect Angels&quot; day care.&nbsp; They are open from 8 to 6pm.<br />Their website is www.perfectangelscc.net<br /><br />i agonized over what to do- what made the most financial sense, etc. can you tell?<br /><br />best of luck to you.....<br />sarah <br />
