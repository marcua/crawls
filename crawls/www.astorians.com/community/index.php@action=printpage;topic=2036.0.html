I still can&#39;t quite figure it out, but I think they use two pieces of thread tightly wound or something. If feels like it is only cutting it, but it takes all the hair out. Much less painful than waxing which also peels off some of your skin and is pretty traumatic to the eye area - especially for those who don&#39;t already have wrinkles. For those of us who do, I think it just makes the wrinkles and lines worse! I think they are able to control the shape better with threading and be very precise.

				threading is actually plucking the hairs with string.<br /><br />try this.<br />get some thread 10 inches long, tie the two ends together.&nbsp; hold out your thumb and fore fingerand twist the loop around 10 times. so now you have your thumb and fore finger on each side with 10 twists in the middle...now open and close either hand... you got a zipper going on in the middle.<br /><br />now bring that zipper to some hair... (sorry to gross you out people) do this to my belly button area... the hairs get stuck in the zipper and pluck them out. that&#39;s my ghetto way of threading. i only do this on areas i can reach. i cannot do it on my face. but that&#39;s the basic idea of threading.<br /><br />in most salons the women instead of tying the ends together, put one end in their teeth. one loop with their thumb and forefinger, and the other end with their other hand. helps to aim and be more accurate.&nbsp; <br /><br />does that make sense...?<br /><br />

				It is incredibly painful but other ladies I&#39;ve seen there appear to bear it with no problems. Maybe I am more sensitive. That said, there are some nice ladies on 23rd Av (on the block southeast of 31st St) in a little shop next to a barbershop. If I go again, I will use toner immediately after because the cream on the new skin helped some little oil blemishes to grow where the hairs were just pulled. Maybe it is just my skin type. Maybe it was because this was a hot month. But it sort of defeated the purpose of a beauty treatment.&nbsp; :|

				I got the sides of my face threaded once and got a horrible rash afterwards.&nbsp; Definitely have that toner and hydrocortisone ready at home!&nbsp; I will never get threaded again.
