				I went last night and liked it.&nbsp; Burgers are Angus, so that&#039;s a plus.&nbsp; Fries were steak cut and crispy, another plus.&nbsp; Hot Dog was your average split type, like Shake Shacks, decent but nothing extraordinary.&nbsp; <br /><br />Love the layout of the place too.&nbsp; And once they get their liquor license, they&#039;ll serve beer.&nbsp; All in all, a nice addition to Long Island City!

				My friend works in the area and went there for lunch. He tried to order a burger medium and was told by the server that they were only offering burgers &quot;well done.&quot;<br /><br />I don&#039;t understand why someone would open a place and buy Pat LaFrieda beef only to serve the burgers cooked well done.<br /><br />Seems like a huge waste...might as well just use the same beef McDonald&#039;s is using then.

				I was excited to see this place open.&nbsp; However, I was disappointed when I went there this past Friday afternoon.&nbsp; It was around 2PM and they were out of ground beef.&nbsp; I know that new places usually have service problems...but running out of ground beef when you&#039;re a burger joint?&nbsp; I commented, why not just go to Costco to get some ground beef?&nbsp; This apparently is not an option.&nbsp; I like supporting local restaurants, so I ordered a hotdog.&nbsp; Nothing spectacular...for a $3+ hotdog.&nbsp; What&#039;s odd also is that they grill the hotdog as they are ordered...while I was eating, I noticed another customer ordering a hotdog...it took almost 10 minutes for this hotdog to get done...I like that they have root beer on tap...that&#039;s a nice touch.&nbsp; They also serve sweet potato fries.&nbsp; I had them...they were OK...kinda soggy.&nbsp; The regular french fries were also OK.&nbsp; IMHO, this place will probably survive just because of Citibank and other businesses in the area.&nbsp; They also what way too many people working behind the counter.&nbsp; I really want to try their burger to compare it with the ones serve up by Five Guys or Jackson Hole.
