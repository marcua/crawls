				Yeah, this is pretty horrible. Thinking about that magnitude of pollutants being introduced into the environment is saddening. It&#039;s devastating on so many levels- from the wildlife, to the fishing industry, to the direct affect on humans. <br /><br />Since this is in politics, I&#039;ll just chime in with - I don&#039;t begrudge the people yelling &quot;Drill, Baby, Drill&quot;. I think reducing foreign dependence on oil is important. This horrible incident doesn&#039;t indicate to me that we don&#039;t need to be doing offshore drilling, but rather the oil companies and whoever is running the rigs need to exercise stricter safety regulations and contingency plans so things like this don&#039;t happen again.

				They say it&#039;s possible the oil spilling can go on for anywhere from 2- 5 months before they can properly cap it. The damage to the water, the marine life, the birds and the hundreds of thousands of people who based their livelihood on fishing and tourism will be devastating. This is already eclipsing the damage of the Exxon-Valdez spill from 20 years ago, so what will the repercussion be months from now?

They are a huge moneymaker, and obviously they want to keep perpetuating that. <br />I don&#039;t think that oil companies are really to blame on this one- they are guilty to the same extent that any of us who drive cars, take cabs, buses or power our houses with electricity produced from fossil fuels.

				Nothing is cut and dry with the energy situation.&nbsp; Drilling for more oil is not a panacea, nor is &quot;green&quot; technology.&nbsp; Here is a worthwhile article on several reasons why green energy is not the miracle cure that it seems to be: http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/miarticle.htm?id=6160&nbsp; Chief among those reasons is the inefficiency of so called green energy.<br /><br />One key piece of the article: &quot;solar and wind technologies require huge amounts of land to deliver relatively small amounts of energy, disrupting natural habitats. Even an aging natural gas well producing 60,000 cubic feet per day generates more than 20 times the watts per square meter of a wind turbine. A nuclear power plant cranks out about 56 watts per square meter, eight times as much as is derived from solar photovoltaic installations.&quot; <br /><br />I personally believe that we need to investigate all potential energy solutions, especially nuclear.

Even an aging natural gas well producing 60,000 cubic feet per day generates more than 20 times the watts per square meter of a wind turbine. A nuclear power plant cranks out about 56 watts per square meter, eight times as much as is derived from solar photovoltaic installations.&quot;<br /><br />I find it ironic that the reflexive anti-drilling mentality is similar to the line of thinking which has also held back the nuclear industry in this country.&nbsp; Nuclear power is safe, reliable, and the impact on the environment is deceptively low.&nbsp; These are not the days of The China Syndrome anymore.&nbsp; I agree that we have to move beyond oil, but until &quot;green&quot; technology matures, we need a proven technology to bridge the gap.<br /><br />Another thing I&#039;d like to point out is that while consumer products from cars to household electronics are moving to &quot;green&quot; battery technology, what do you think is used to generate the electricity that fuels those batteries?

				With offshore rigs dropping into the sea, oil taps gushing crude into our waters, and coal mines collapsing on our workers, I think it&#039;s high-time our nation started investing in new energy solutions. Since the market continues to incentivize dangerous and dirty sources of power, public investment is needed to spur innovation. Wind and solar, definitely, but let&#039;s see some real funding for &nbsp;fusion power &nbsp;(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_power) too. Most of the research in this area is being done in Europe (notably the &nbsp;ITER project, &nbsp;(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITER) in which the US reluctantly participates). If the federal government put as much subsidy into new energy solutions as it has for fossil fuels, we&#039;d see results much faster. Needless to say, this would also create demand for skilled labor.

				Carter was pushing for cleaner alternative energies to the oil, and even installed solar panels on the roof of the White House. Then Reagan became president, took the solar panels off the White House roof, said government involvement is a bad thing, and handed the reins to the big corporations. In the meantime countries like Norway, Finland, France, even Brazil began investing into cleaner alternative. Here we are in 2010 and the US is hardly any better off than we were in 1980. We could have taken big strides by now in technological advances, instead we have only made a couple of baby steps.

Back when this started, people didn&#039;t realize how bad it really was. It&#039;s taken a while for it to sink in. It&#039;s not so much an &quot;oil spill&quot; as it is an oil flow. The perceived lack of urgency you&#039;re seeing might be because no one&#039;s really sure what to do about it. It is kind of overwhelming to think about; the depth of the leak makes this very difficult to deal with. The Ixtoc blowout in 1979 was only 50 meters under water, and this one is almost a mile down. <br /><br />There&#039;ve been a couple stories taking the angle that people are angry at Obama for not acting faster, but what&#039;s he supposed to do aside from making sure those who can handle it are dealing with it as best they can? The only people qualified to handle this are those in the oil drilling industry. It&#039;s not like Katrina, where the primary concern at first was getting thousands of people out of a flooded area, and the more resources that were immediately dealing with it the better the rescue effort would be. This is about stopping millions of gallons of oil from coming out of an extremely deep underwater hole. There aren&#039;t too many people qualified in dealing with this sort of thing, not much stuff exists for dealing with this sort of thing, and even those who are qualified in dealing with it don&#039;t seem to know the best course of action for 1) stopping the flow and 2) cleaning up all the oil. And cleaning up the oil is of course very important, but you don&#039;t want to do that in a way that destroys even more of the environment and wildlife than this already will.<br /><br />Clearly we&#039;re going to need oil for a long time, though hopefully a time comes soon where we don&#039;t need to rely on oil nearly as much because we have a variety of other energy resources as well as much more efficient energy-using devices. But as for the criticism that green energy is simply not as efficient as energy from fossil fuels, while I&#039;m no expert on the matter, I have to think that is at least partially because the technology hasn&#039;t been developed yet to its fullest potential. We&#039;ve been working with oil and natural gas a hell of a lot longer than we&#039;ve been working with solar panels and wind turbines, and more energy-efficient devices are being developed all the time.

				Thought you might find this interesting.&nbsp; It&#039;s an article on a site intended for public relations people: http://paulseaman.eu/2010/05/risk-free-energy-boycott-bp-no-way/<br />It basically starts from the standpoint that there is no such thing as risk free energy, despite the reaction from the uninformed public, which seems to think otherwise.&nbsp; The article then goes on to discuss what PR strategy BP should take, if any.<br /><br />As far as Hailburton&#039;s involvement with BP, I&#039;m not sure how Cheney could possibly relate to this accident.&nbsp; He hasn&#039;t been involved with Haliburton for over ten years, so at some point things have to stop being his &quot;fault,&quot; real or perceived.&nbsp; I&#039;m not opining as to whether Haliburton bears any of the responsibility because I simply don&#039;t know enough about the situation, but I highly doubt this has anything to do with Cheney as Debbie suggested it might.&nbsp; Even if Cheney was involved in negotiating some deal or subcontract between Haliburton and BP (and I have seen nothing that suggests that he did), that would have nothing to do with this accident.

				Well it only seems to be getting worse. BP seems more concerned with covering s___ up and siphoning oil to sell than actually stopping the flow.

Just as in our most recent economic recession, the fact is that the regulation these industries do face often don&#039;t do s___. Like kempster mentioned, the regulators are just as bad as the corporations they&#039;re supposed to regulate. And that&#039;s because they&#039;re largely made up of individuals who seem to be incapable of caring about the larger implications of their actions. Those who do care, the whistleblowers out there, are generally ignored and alienated. It is a human problem, not just a problem with large corporations. And who&#039;s to say BP would listen to regulators in the first place? They kept using the toxic dispersants even after the EPA clearly and publicly told them to stop. <br /><br />This is a large reason why conservatives tend to be against government regulation - it often doesn&#039;t help, and sometimes it makes things worse. Average citizens get comfortable with the idea that things are fine because the government is looking out for their best interests. No one knows there&#039;s a problem until something inevitably goes terribly wrong. <br /><br />It&#039;s easy to blame a corporation or industry like health insurance companies, investment bankers, and Big Oil for screwing up our lives, but the fact is these industries already have government regulators who are supposed to be keeping them in line. But it seems all they do is make more and more laws that the companies find ways to ignore or work around. And in the end they don&#039;t do anything about it until, again, something goes terribly wrong and people like us get really angry, a few executives get fired, and then the same thing happens again later on. <br /><br />And no, I do not have a reasonable solution to this problem. I figure we&#039;re screwed either way, until more people who have consciences and common decency start craving power. Yes, we do have massive energy needs, but most people aren&#039;t interested in trying to use less energy until it becomes unaffordable for them to do anything else. We won&#039;t see a real push towards safer, cleaner, renewable energy sources until oil becomes so distasteful to people that there are true pushes towards innovation and large-scale implementation (the latter of which is the hardest part).

				Just got this email:<br /><br /><strong>Libertarians say government shares blame with BP for oil spill</strong><br /><br />WASHINGTON - Wes Benedict, executive director of the Libertarian Party, issued the following statement today:<br /><br />&quot;The federal government and BP share the blame for the large oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.<br /><br />&quot;When the CEO of BP appeared at a Congressional hearing yesterday, Republicans and Democrats predictably engaged in finger-pointing and blame-ducking, trying to score political points. Their fingers should have been pointed at themselves.<br /><br />&quot;When President Obama gave his Oval Office speech on Tuesday, there was one important word missing: the word &#039;liability.&#039; The president never mentioned that, thanks to liability caps provided by the federal government, BP was able to engage in riskier activities than it would have otherwise. If BP had known in advance that it would be fully liable for all damages related to an oil spill, it probably would have taken greater safeguards. When you know that your liability will be strictly limited, cutting corners becomes a lot more attractive.<br /><br />&quot;The spill will cause a lot of damage to the property and livelihood of people living along the Gulf. We have a well-developed system of civil courts to help people obtain compensation. Unfortunately, the legislative and executive branches have inappropriately trampled on this territory, and they seem to be trying to take the place of the courts.<br /><br />&quot;The president has apparently convinced BP to put $20 billion in some kind of compensation account. He said in his speech that it will be &#039;administered by an independent third party.&#039; Will this third party be able to decide what &#039;legitimate claims&#039; are, and how much they should receive? Assessing damages should be done by courts, not by political bureaucrats appointed in backroom deals between the president and a large corporation.<br /><br />&quot;The president could have taken the opportunity to talk about getting government out of the energy industry, and allowing the free market to guide the future of energy production. Unfortunately, he instead blamed the free market for government failures, and discussed his hopes of increasing government interference in the energy industry.<br /><br />&quot;For decades, Libertarians have warned against putting trust in government regulatory bureaucracies like the Minerals Management Service (MMS). While costing the taxpayers a lot of money, these agencies generally fail to deliver the kind of protections they promise, they tend to become corrupt, and they discourage vigilance on the part of citizens by lulling them into a false sense of security.<br /><br />&quot;When large companies and the government start working together, the results can be disastrous. Congressional liability caps, the MMS bureaucracy, and BP have all cooperated to create a costly disaster that should never have happened.&quot;

It seems that there are skimmers in other parts of the world doing nothing that should have been brought to the gulf......that&#039;s just one example.

				Tropical storm headed to the main spill site. I wonder if this will push the oil faster towards the shoreline?<br /><br />
