				I read many of the posts in &quot;Where&#039;s my Demographic&quot; and I wondered the same thing about mine.&nbsp; How many of you are 40+ and where do you like to go?&nbsp; I like the Beer Garden but that is seasonal.

				I&#039;m 43 and I like a lot of the restaurants around here--not a big bar fan but I get out a little bit, Irish Rover, Dillinger&#039;s, beer garden, Sparrow a couple times.&nbsp; The main thing is I&#039;m usually heading home by the time of the evening that the 20-somethings are heading out.<br /><br />I wish I had a lawn so I could yell &quot;get off my lawn, you rotten kids!!!&quot;&nbsp; I am missing out on that cherished perquisite of aging.

				I am usually huffing and puffing while jogging around the track in the park or huffing and puffing and chasing a tennis ball at the tennis court in the park during the summer. Ah, yes! I have had the pleasure of chasing neighborhood weisenheimers out of my backyard during balmy summer evenings!

Then I can post here instead of starting my own 60+ Astorians! (Which, BTW, would probably consist of only 1 poster.)<br /><br />Back to topic.<br /><br />I really hate crowded restaurants, so I tend to go at odd hours. I also find that I am much more willing to travel out of the neighborhood for some stuff not available here. My 2 best friends (another 2 old bags) and I love to find things to do on weekdays to avoid the crowds. I used to love the Beer Garden, but I won&#039;t stand in line for anything. Sometimes we go at off hours, and believe it or not, none of us drink. We like the food, and the outdoors. In the warm weather, I love to sit outside at one of the 30th Avenue cafés (I prefer Athens) and enjoy an iced coffee or a frappé. I sometimes bring the dogs for the outing, and they just lay down under my chair.

				I&#039;m 56. I like to go most places that get mentioned here, so long as euro-techno-beat music is not involved. Haven&#039;t been eating out often as I used to, (which was every night at one time.)<br /><br />I like places where I can read as I eat.<br /><br />Don&#039;t hang out in bars much, thought I go to the Rover, and to.. i forget what it&#039;s called, used to be the Pulpit (30th ave &amp; 45th ish.) Dillingers looks promising - I will get around to trying the food there soon. I like the Jackson Ave. Steakhouse once a week, and Manetta&#039;s almost that often. Thai Pavilion since it&#039;s nearby, good, and because I&#039;ve been acquainted with the owner and her daughter since they first opened.<br /><br />Food at Stove is very good; I would go there often except the three times I have gone, there has been a sewer odor, probably from a bad trap in the bar service sink or something, that bothers me. The waiter doesn&#039;t seem to notice the odor, so I am giving them a while before I try again.<br /><br />I am starting to digress like Grampa Simpson; I guess that will be a hazard of this topic.<br /><br />Bruce

				I&#039;m 43, my boyfriend is 42. When we stay around the neighborhood, we like<br />Brick for drinks on the weekends. The crowd there is pretty mixed, relaxed and<br />never any trouble. We also go to Indigo once in awhile after work and the Rover too - <br />great crowd there and they had a fun band last year on St. Patty&#039;s day.<br /><br />We don&#039;t eat out a lot, but when we do we&#039;ll go to Mezo Mezo on<br />32nd St. &amp; Ditmars, L&#039;Incontro, 718, Grand Cafe (30th &amp; 37th St.). Sunday afternoons<br />we like this Mexican place called Gonzalez y Gonzales on Broadway near Prince Street.<br />Decent food and drinks, good service and always very laid back on a Sunday. <br /><br />I&#039;ve never gone to the Beer Garden -&nbsp; I think I&#039;ve always had the impression that it<br />was really crowded in nice weather and we thought the crowd might be too young. <br />But we&#039;ll try it out one day. We also go to a lot of movies, either at the Kaufmann or<br />in the city, plus theatre and concerts. <br /><br />We&#039;ve been planning to try Mojave - maybe this weekend!

				Hi there,<br /><br />Not much of a poster on this board (am a bit shy), but I am an avid reader.&nbsp; Since this thread speaks to me personally, I think I&#039;ll venture out there a bit.&nbsp; I&#039;m 41 and my boyfriend is 48.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been living in Astoria for over 20 years, and in recent years, I&#039;ve watched the clientèle at the local restaurants get younger and younger, so am happy to see there are still plenty of 40+ year olds in the neighborhood.&nbsp; Since I&#039;m in the Ditmars area, I also frequent Mezo Mezo, 718, L&#039;Incontro (as does ladydi), and I would add Wave Thai and Watawa to my local list.&nbsp; But I also go to many of the restaurants on the &quot;other side,&quot; particularly when it&#039;s movie night.&nbsp; I get all of my restaurant recommendations from this board, so thank you all for the information everyone contributes about the local eateries.<br />

				Hey - I&#039;m glad someone started this - I&#039;ve been wondering what the 40+ contingent looks like<br /><br />Full disclosure... i&#039;m 39.... but it&#039;s close enough.&nbsp; My husband is 41 - so our average is 40. <br /><br />I&#039;m pregnant now - and haven&#039;t really spent much time in bars in a while... but i do like pub quiz at the Rover... or just hanging out at the Rover.&nbsp; I like the beer garden - to play games and eat - but I won&#039;t wait in line either.&nbsp; I like the idea of Sparrow... though I&#039;m happier there for brunch than at night... <br /><br />I feel like we go out to eat all the time - though there isn&#039;t any one place where we end up more than others - except maybe at our dining room table and in the back yard in good weather. <br /><br />Places that I avoid - definitely the restaurants that blast music at ridiculous levels.&nbsp; I can&#039;t quite figure out what the restaurant owners are thinking ... actually... no... I can&#039;t figure out what the patrons of those places are thinking.&nbsp;

				Astoria...let me tell you something about being 38...YOU&#039;RE NOT 40.<br /><br />When you hit 40 you&#039;ll be OK for a couple more years then by 43 your vision starts to go (reading glasses).<br /><br />Then your skin starts getting a bit dryer and you have to moisterize it and you can&#039;t get away with not remembering anymore or skipping a day...no day skipping!<br /><br />Then you notice that there&#039;s a bit more hair on your brush when you brush your done brushing it.<br /><br />Things start to sag...you may be fit but things still sag, whether male or female gravity takes it&#039;s toll on certain ahum &quot;extremities&quot;.<br /><br />Chin hairs for women...<br />Ear/nose hair for men...<br /><br />Hair in other places for some people ....<br /><br />Silver strands of hair in your head AND...other places!!!<br /><br />Old High School, athletic injuries start hurting again...<br /><br />You look at stairs and say...ugh<br /><br />Even if you&#039;re fit, the waistline starts to disappear.......<br /><br />Enjoy being 38, 39, 40, 41, and most of 42........after that enjoy the ride towards Senior Citizenship :-)

				I had mentioned never waiting in line for anything ever again, and a friend reminded me that when we were younger we would sleep overnight outside Lincoln Center to get Mostly Mozart tickets. Or the time we got up at 2:00 AM to get in to the City to stand in line for 8 hours for the Tutankhamen exhibit tickets. We must have been high! Now, I see a line and I know I don&#039;t want to go anywhere near it!<br /><br />I am also not as adventurous about food as I used to be. I used to travel a lot, and I always ate the local food. Now, I ask what it is, and if it makes me gag, I don&#039;t want any part of it, thank you.<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard that getting older is not for sissies. It&#039;s not, but the complacency of it is really quite enjoyable.<br /><br />Hey, lizluv43, I am living proof of gravity. On really cold nights, when we get no heat, I simply have to wrap my sagging mammary glands around my neck and I feel nice and warm. I swear that some morning I am going to wake up and my butt is gonna be brushing the against my calves!

				Hi.....<br />If you&#039;re looking for a local bar with &quot;old man flavor&quot;, The Hell Gate Bar on Ditmars off 21st Street is a great neighborhood pub.&nbsp; Athen Cafe on 30th Ave (or Grand Ave as we used to call it) is also good and has huge hot chocolates!<br /><br />And, as corny as it may sound, my favorite place to &quot;still&quot; hang out is Astoria Park.&nbsp; Even in the cold weather, I&#039;ll grab the NY Daily News or my favorite magazine and drive down to the shore to read and enjoy the view. I&#039;ve always considered it my own backyard.<br /><br />But that&#039;s just me!&nbsp; &nbsp;:roll:

				All day I&#039;ve been thinking about the Beer Garden.&nbsp; Why don&#039;t we have a get together one weeknight in late May early June.&nbsp; I agree we should expand the group to 35+.&nbsp; We could get two or 3 tables.&nbsp; If Astorians less than 35 want to come they would be welcome also.

				I&#039;ll be joining the 40+ crowd in July.&nbsp; For a little while I was feeling apprehensive about turning 40, but some very wise 40+ women friends of mine convinced me that there was nothing to worry about, and that the 40s are even better than the 30s. Now I&#039;m looking forward to it!&nbsp;

				My husband and I are in our 40&#039;s. In the &#039;hood we like Stamatis, Sanford, L&#039;Incontro, Brick, Fatty&#039;s, Manducati&#039;s, Waterfront Crab House, Cup was good once but the food is very sketchy lately, in summer we have gone to Water Taxi Beach where everyone is 12, LIC bar,and some other assorted LIC bars...As all the cool bars i liked in the city have either closed or completely changed clientele, (like 7b - one of my old haunts currently ruined by NYU students in the evenings) I&#039;m tending to hang more locally or just hit random city places but not with alot of frequency.&nbsp; Went to that new Thai place on Broadway, Leng, very nice, but Thai Pavillion staff is great -remembers who you are and always welcomes you back. Would love to hear more about diff bars and places in the area that aren&#039;t full of &#039;uptalking&#039; trendsters. sorry if that sounds mean.<br /><br />
