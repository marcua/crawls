				of the new construction condos these are the nicest I&#039;ve seen for size of bathrooms/closets, layout, finishes, etc.&nbsp; but they come with a half-size at best electric oven/stove top and I just don&#039;t understand that at all.&nbsp; I realize lots of people use their ovens for storage, but spending that much money and not being able to cook, say, a chicken -- seems insane.&nbsp; Perhaps an odd deal-breaker but I swear that thing was not much bigger than my toaster oven.&nbsp; <br />The noise didn&#039;t actually seem that bad (though of course the open house is on the top floor).&nbsp; I opened the balcony door as a train came by just to hear the difference and it is significant.&nbsp; Though I sure wouldn&#039;t want to be on the 3rd floor.&nbsp; train windows zipping right by your living room window.&nbsp; just too weird! <br />

				I&#039;ve been noticing the electric heaters more and more.&nbsp; I don&#039;t like the air they make, nor do I like the bills.&nbsp; The heat doesn&#039;t last either.&nbsp; It just seems like construction is so cheap these days, from cheap razor thin walls, shoddy construction, small kitchens and bathrooms, to electric heat - and then they still call it luxury.&nbsp; BS is what I call it.

				Then they should stop trying to fool anybody and say, &quot;Great places for people who don&#039;t cook much!&quot; and call it a &quot;kitchenette,&quot; maybe even take away some of the space and add a big closet.

				Only 4 places under contract? I would be VERY wary of buying something there. It screams foreclosure...or even better -- it is likely to get converted to rentals. Would you want to purchase and then realize you could rent at half the cost...free of maintenance and taxes?

				One good thing is that once Astoria buildings become known for their lousy value, our neighborhood will regain its reputation as uncool and dorky. Prices should be lowered accordingly.<br /><br />Meanwhile, magazines ought to stop running &quot;Astoria is Great!!&quot; articles and replace them with &quot;Astoria Alternatives.&quot; There have got to be other halfway-decent neighborhoods with better real estate options.

				I think my favorite part of the website is how the artist&#039;s renderings don&#039;t include the EL tracks in front of the building.<br /><br />I looked again at the gallery - that cheap tiny kitchenette has me cracking up...and I also looked at the available units page.&nbsp; I can&#039;t believe someone would pay $534,240 for something doesn&#039;t even have a full kitchen.&nbsp; The building doesn&#039;t even have a doorman or any amenities. I guess &quot;imported European doors&quot; cost a lot of money.&nbsp; I suppose everyone has a different opinion of &quot;value&quot;.<br /><br />Am I the only person that would rather just have a slightly larger apartment instead of a terrace?&nbsp; Here is your lovely view of...nothing.

				I really wanted to go see these apts but after all the bad comments here i figuered whats the point /.&nbsp; &nbsp;Tiny kitchen in all these apts&nbsp; prob add up to a couple of extra apts in total , so the builder im sure had that in mind .&nbsp; &nbsp;As far as electric heat goes , it totally sucks . They prob hope you wont know the difference and you wont see an electric bill till after you buy it .&nbsp; <br />Well since sales are terrible maybe they will start renting them out as apts like pistilli did in upper ditmars near the shopping center . He way overpriced them and in the end had no choice . <br />I did see some really nice condo in upper ditmars , very nice quiet and safe block . Great to raise a family and PS 2 is right there , one of the best elementary schools in the area /

				Thanks Lanseaux.&nbsp; That definitely helps!&nbsp; I think I might have seen them in many hotels.&nbsp; It seems they are marketed to those and senior citizen homes.&nbsp; I wonder how many new condos are using this unit, and if people find them better than regular radiator gas heating systems.&nbsp; They look like they save a good amount of money.<br /><br />Sorry to derail the thread.&nbsp; Back to those other condos.....&nbsp; <br /><br />

				My friend lives in a new apartment building on 30th avenue and has some kind of metered heating in his apartment.&nbsp; His utility bill is almost $300 a month despite keeping the heat at 65 and lower all night.&nbsp; 85% of his utility bill is for gas (heating).&nbsp; So you get a double whammy of high rent AND no utilities included.&nbsp; &nbsp;I should ask him if he has these units in his apartment.&nbsp; It&#039;s very new, the first one to live in the apartment--so now I am curious.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=16790.msg189380.html#msg189380">Quote from: daisy on February 17, 2010, 08:07:51 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">There are some really nice (from the outside) condos on 21 Ave and 24th St:&nbsp; http://www.plaza21condos.com/apartments.&nbsp; <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That that building does look nice on the outside.&nbsp; I just looked at the floor plan of the most expensive two bedroom ($620,000).&nbsp; The bedrooms are small and the living/dining area isn&#039;t that spacious either, but the kitchen seems nice.&nbsp; No linen/utility closet....who designs these places?&nbsp; It&#039;s a good walk from the subway and there isn&#039;t much in the general area of this building.

				$300 for heating an apt ?&nbsp; Thats pretty crazy . I pay around 80-100 dollars a month tops to heat 2 floors in a brick house attached . I could understand if the boiler was running alll day long cranked to 85 degrees like some people prob do , but 65 degrees and lower&nbsp; no way it should run you that much .

				2 huge bedrooms , large enough to both fit king size beds and 2 baths&nbsp; .All wooden floors with large living rooms . Everything is brand new as it is brand new construction . Granite kitchen as well . As for being lucky , not at all&nbsp; since the rent prices are reflected to what every single owner on the block rents out for . Some are over 2k a month . Im in the upper ditmars area and its not even close to the train but people love the area cuz its so quiet and peacfull . Not alot of traffic or noise at night unlike 30th ave and broadway . Crappy small&nbsp; 2 bedroom on Ditmars by the train with terrible kitchens and old appliances from the 80&#039;s&nbsp; are going for $1500-$1700 easy , so y would 2 grand be too much for something brandnew and high end .

				It all depends on how you wanna live . Some people wouldnt be able to stay in&nbsp; a place thats &quot;falling apart&quot; , others can . Not saying you didnt do the right thing , cuz like you said , its only renting and you wont be there forever so why not pocket the additional 6k you wouldve spent yearly on a higher end place . But at the same time&nbsp; , there are some couple who only want those higher end apts . We all have seen those posts asking for what they seek an apt to look like and alot of times it sounds crazy but they are willing to pay .&nbsp; &nbsp;Hey some people lease cars and add option after option and&nbsp; they wont hardly use them , but just to know they have them is good enough&nbsp; . Might sound dumb to some , but the person leasing , or in this case renting is the one paying . <br />My mom had two 2 bedroom apts&nbsp; on 28st and Ditmars , my mother inlaw the same . My cousin and 2 aunts have one 2-bedroom apt each they rent out as well all on the same block .None are new or really updated much . All are in private houses .&nbsp; &nbsp;All 7 apts go for 1500-1700 each .

				First time posting in this site(excellent site btw!) :-)&nbsp; I checked that condo website and notice a 600 sq.ft 1bedroom is priced 348k. If that is overprice, how much should those be? Keeping in mind of course it is a brand-new building and it is near to everything. <br />&nbsp; I&#039;m a first time buyer looking to for a 1bedroom that is near either the 36th train or the Broadway station and this astor condo looks promising. I also checked out the ones near 37th (Astoriana?) and the least priced 1bedroom there was 575 i think priced 315k. Anyone have any suggestions? Thanks&nbsp;

I don&#039;t know but 270K for a third floor studio facing the tracks seems insane to me.

				Article says that 24/80 units are under signed contract.<br /><br />Which does mean that some could still back out of contract, depending on its terms, and lose only a minor deposit. I don&#039;t think that they will fill up anytime soon, and prices are certain to drop, or convert to rentals. It would be nice to see some sanity back in the market here...
