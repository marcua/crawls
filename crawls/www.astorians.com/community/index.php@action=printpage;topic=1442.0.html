				Last night I had the mucnchies. My husband eager to please went out to the local deli to grab something for me. It was 1 am and normally Astoria is a safe place to walk at night. 3 young guys 18ish to 22ish jumped my husband and started beating on him in an attemt to rob him on 27th street between 23rd and 24th. If you are walking late at night be carefull.&nbsp; :x

				Oh, that sucks. I&#39;m sorry to hear that. I hope he&#39;s OK.<br /><br />I&#39;ve been noticing a knot of suspicious-looking guys hanging out around there for some time now, usually in front of the deli on the corner of 28th St. and 24th Avenue and around that old man&#39;s bar up the block on 23rd Ave, and I&#39;ve seen drugs dealt at night right in front of Betty&#39;s Bagles.<br /><br />I&#39;ve also been seeing more police presence, especially on Ditmars and 23rd Ave.<br /><br />Then there&#39;s that notice in the Ditmars subway station alerting people to the fact that there have been daytime break-ins in the area.<br /><br />I think we&#39;re experiencing an up-tick in crime. Check out the latest stats from 114th precinct (PDF doc): <br /><br />http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/pdf/chfdept/cs114pct.pdf<br /><br />Granted, the 114th covers a much larger area including Ravenswood and Queensbridge Houses, and their homicide stats include Rikers (&nbsp; :-o !!), but that isn&#39;t to say that this particular area is becoming more attractive to muggers, thieves and dealers...

				I also had a friend that got mugged recently near the park by Astoria Blvd.<br /><br />This concerns me a lot and makes me want to do something about it.

				I was mugged at knifepoint this summer, right outside my apartment. It was a pain in the ass, but it could have beena lot worse. Not to be trie but I guess that&#39;s life in the big city. It would have been no big deal but circumstances too boring to explain caused the ordeal to drag on for weeks. We never got the kids that did it but I&#39;m pretty sure I know who they are. I think I saw them a few weeks ago smashing bottles on 36th avenue at 2:30am.<br /><br />Anyway, a few nights after I got mugged I was having dinner somewhere on a quiet Sunday night when suddenly a massive swarm of cop cars screamed in to the intersection outside -- they cornered a guy who had just held up someone at gunpoint on Steinway Street near 35th Ave. <br /><br />It started to feel like the neighborhood <em>must</em> be going to hell -- and at the time there was definitely something going on in terms of a spike in number of incidents in a small area. It mostly revolved around the Kaufmann-Astoria Studio buildings, and I had heard about several things happening around there even before my little incident. Much of this activity goes unreported, of course.<br /><br />Not sure what the point of this posting is... Oh, I know: <span class="bbc_u">Hide those Ipods and $600 smartphones</span>. I would not have gotten mugged myself that night if I followed that obvious advice.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

It was only about midnight, at about which time I dumbassedly stopped for a few minutes on 35th Avenue, whipped out my Treo and shot off a bunch of text messages and IMs to whoever. Several minutes of me standing there on an inexplicably vacant street with a $600 cell phone. Couple of d00dz saw me, followed me all the way back here, then when the normally busy 29th street magically emptied of all humans the d00dz went to work with their Turkish sword-esque blade thing and what was either a gun or a bag of celery hearts in the pants of the backup kid. They were pretty well rehearsed.<br /><br />It seemed like a big deal type of thing for a while. Now I&#39;d like to take those kids aside and thank them for being so professional about it.<br /><br />An eyewitness saw the whole thing from about 12 feet away. She and I wound up spending one of the weirdest nights together of any I can remember with anybody anywhere, going all the way back to those bewildering wtf junior high school days. <br /><br />Maybe it wasn&#39;t that weird, but it seemed so at the time.<br />

				Well, really, it&#39;s in the phone book. Not exactly confidential information. If it makes you nervous then CLOSE YOUR EYES AND MAKE IT GO AWAY!!&nbsp; :evil:<br /><br />There was a happy ending to the mugging story. They got away with my drivers license, which of course contained my address and phone information (which they could have otherwise just scarfed from a phone book, or eventually from this BBS). <br /><br />I was worried they&#39;d make use of this information and show up on my fire escape one night to, y&#39;know, close the deal. <br /><br />Well, a week or so after the mugging I checked my mail and guess what? The muggers mailed my drivers license back to me! How professional of them was that? I felt a group hug coming on then realized it was just me standing there...<br />

				Wow, thoughtful criminals!&nbsp; It is a real pain in the butt to get your lisence renewed.<br /><br />A friend of mine was walking home from the 46th Street R/V/G (does the G actually run, BTW?) last July when two guys started running after her.&nbsp; They spanish speaking men and about 5&#39;4&quot; in height.&nbsp; Luckily my friend was about 10 paces from her door and got in just in time.&nbsp; My boyfriend and I were in her apartment already and by the time he went out to chase them off they were gone.&nbsp; <br /><br />That&#39;s the only strange incident I&#39;ve ever heard of personnally.&nbsp; I used to waitress until all hours of the night.&nbsp; I never once had an incident of my own in Astoria.&nbsp; <br /><br />Hope everyone keeps safe.&nbsp;

				I have a friend who was recently mugged at gunpoint on 30th Ave. near the train on Wednesday night- the police told her someone had been mugged near the same location the night before and at the Dunkin&#39; Donuts earlier that evening.

				I realize this is a rants page but there is support out there for crime victims. If anyone who has been a victim of a mugging or other violent crime and has been feeling anxious, worried, had been suffering from sleep disruptions or otherwise been having a hard time ever since the incident, please don&#39;t hesitate to contact HANAC&#39;s crime victim support group at (718) 728-3811<br />If you prefer to just walk in, they&#39;re located at&nbsp; 23-16 30th Avenue...<br /><br />One of my clients was robbed in her own apartment three months ago right when I first started working. She has been traumatized so deeply and I&#39;ve finally won her trust enough to get her to go seek help for her anxiety and PTSD symptoms. It&#39;s a real shame that crimes like this appear to be on the rise.

				My car was stolen last week. I got a call Sat night from the 111 PCT telling me my&nbsp; car was found in Douglaston totally trashed. I have to get a new car as I need it for work. Not that I can afford it. I/m worried now I;ll be charged towing and storage fees for a car that was stolen. I find out tomorrow.<br />Kids joy riding -- wonder if it&#39;s the same lads people been reporting on 23 24th Aves..<br />Gotta go car shopping and I&#39;ll have to finance something now<br />
