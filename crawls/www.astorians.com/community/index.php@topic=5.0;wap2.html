			Great place, but it's 21st St, not 31st St.<br /><br />there's a newer branch further down 21st St, just south of Broadway on the west side.<br /><br /><br />JIM

			whoopsee.<br /><br /><br /><br />hope i didn't throw anyone off. or p anyone off who was looking for the restaurant. it is indeed on 21st st. i used to get 21st St. and 31st St. mixed up when i first moved to astoria.<br /><br /><br /><br />as if that is interesting information to anyone but myself.<br /><br /><br /><br />the original post was quite a while back. i'm glad someone still picked up on it. ROTI BOTI is definitely worth a detour to the fringe of the 'neighborhood.' it's just within walking distance of astoria park - and a nice place to drop in after a couple of hours of reading or walking the track...<br /><br /><br /><br />in newer restaurant picks news:<br /><br /><br /><br />word on the ave is Michelangelo's<br /><br /><br /><br />23rd ave, that is. great GREAT thin crust pizza. but that's not all they do. i ordered from them by phone once- asked if they could do a ravioli puttanesca (anchovies, olives, capers, onions) it wasn't even on the menu and twenty minutes later barabing-baraboom. there it was. even if it did come in a tin-foil to go tray it tasted like it had been prepared with... i hate to say it. love.<br /><br /><br /><br />i have heard evenings are best. good luck. and good eating.<br /><br /><br /><br />ff
