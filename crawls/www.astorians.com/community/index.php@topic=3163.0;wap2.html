			I did not post this on &quot;Finding _____ in Astoria&quot; because it&#39;s not necessarily Astoria-oriented, but I need some input.&nbsp; My new Dell Inspiron E1505&#39;s hard drive is kaput.&nbsp; Crash and burn - &quot;unmountable boot volume&quot;&nbsp; is all I get across a blue screen.&nbsp; So, the company is sending along a new hard drive, but I need to return the old drive to them.&nbsp; So, my question is: does anyone know how to completely erase a laptop hard drive that cannot be accessed?&nbsp; It does contain passwords and credit card and personal info, so I would feel much more secure sending it to the strangers at Dell if it was wiped of all data.&nbsp; I can change a hard drive, but I&#39;m not computer whiz, so any suggestions are welcome.&nbsp; Many thanks in advance.<br /><br />-Craig.

			I would do a google search for &quot;hard drive cleanser.&quot;&nbsp; I had such a thing done to my computer at my school&#39;s computer help desk.&nbsp; The cleanser seemed to be a software program, and I think there are some that are available online.&nbsp; Good luck!

			Hit it repeatedly with a sledgehammer. Oh, that might void the warranty...<br /><br />The trick is that you need to get the old hard drive running in order to erase it. If the drive had a head crash (did it make really scary sounds before it stopped working?), then your work is done for you. If not, and if you just have some corrupted sectors where the operating system is, then anyone who plugs the machine into another computer can read the data. <br /><br />It&#39;s trickier that it&#39;s a laptop, since you can&#39;t just plug the old drive in alongside the new drive. You should be able to boot off of a Windows CD in recovery mode and examine the old drive. If you can see the files then you didn&#39;t have a head crash, and you will need to delete everything. In that case, I&#39;d suggest (a) copying your important data to a USB key or to CDs or something, then (b) using a free disk-wipe utility. Here&#39;s a list of those utilities. Different ones work different ways, but one thing you could do would be to install Darik&#39;s Boot and Nuke, which is a CD that securely wipes the drive of whatever computer you boot it on. (!) Create the CD, label it &quot;DEATH&quot; in big red letters, then boot your PC with that CD. <br /><br />Oh, and this should be obvious, but whatever you do, before the new drive comes in the mail, use a sharpie to write the word BAD on your old drive so you don&#39;t do anything bad by mistake...<br /><br />Hope this helps...<br />

			Thanks for the info and suggestions.&nbsp; The drive cannot be accessed - at all.&nbsp; Well, not by me.&nbsp; I power on and the result is a static blue screen reading &quot;unmountable boot volume&quot; and some other jargon.&nbsp; Will not start&nbsp; in safe mode or any option under F8 or F12.&nbsp; BUT -- I am certain all of my info is still on there.&nbsp; The OS is rreparable, but that doesn&#39;t mean that my data and personal info has been destroyed.&nbsp; And I don&#39;t want to discover the hard way that some goon has managed to tap into the hard drive and extract passwords (PayPal, eBay, e-mail, etc) or credit card info...<br /><br />Someone finally replied to me on the Dell forums and suggested:<br /><br />http://www.killdisk.com/<br /><br />

			There&#39;s a very important distinction between &quot;the drive cannot be accessed at all&quot; and &quot;the drive cannot be booted at all&quot;. As you say, it&#39;s entirely possible that other parts of the drive (aside from the boot sector and where the OS lives) are fine. It&#39;s also entirely possible that your entire drive is toast. Until you boot off of some other medium (like a CD) and try to access the drive, there&#39;s no way to know. Safe mode only deals with minor misconfigurations of the OS, not with actual damage to the disk.<br /><br />Note that killdisk or any other solution for erasing data will only work if you can boot from another medium and access the disk. If you can&#39;t access the disk at all, even booting from CD or whatever, then you&#39;re out of luck. Or maybe you&#39;re in luck, since it&#39;s pretty hard to access data from a dead drive if you can&#39;t even use it as a secondary drive. Nobody&#39;s going to bother with your disk if it&#39;s not accessable...
