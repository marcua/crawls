				Hi all, my first post will be a LOUD one&nbsp; :-). Has anyone noticed lately (and especially this weekend) the seemingly incredible amount of helicopter traffic above this area (I&#039;m just below the beer garden on 24th ave.)? One after another (or is it always the same one?) circling, and flying really low. Some neighbors and I couldn&#039;t believe last night how low they were flying. <br /><br />I hear some once in a while but this past week or two has been ridiculous. Is homeland security that bored? <br /><br />

				That area of Astoria is in/near the flight path of helicopters traveling from LaGuardia to Manhattan. When it is overcast, or hazy like it has been this weekend, they will fly exceptionally low, like they have been this weekend.

				I always assume low flying helicopters mean someone&#039;s been firing a gun and the police are after them.&nbsp; You have to check what kind of markings the helicoptor has (NYPD, for instance) and if it&#039;s circling.&nbsp; Of course a searchlight is a dead givaway - that the criminal out to give up and give themselves away!&nbsp; If the helicopters are going in a straight line between Manhattan and LaGuardia, then it&#039;s probably a commuter craft.&nbsp; If they stay mainly over the river it could be a sightseeing helicopter.&nbsp; If they&#039;re hoving over a bridge it could be a movie being shot.&nbsp; 3 helicopters at about the same height, hovering or moving around in a small area - I used to assume baaad traffic tie up, then I saw this scene over the area near Target in College Point and figured out long later this was the first report of West Nile and they were filming the insecticide spraying, and now when I see 3 helicopters, sadly I would assume crane collapse.&nbsp; One big dark helicopter with two sets of blades on top - either we&#039;re at war, or hopefully, it&#039;s just an arial demonstration.<br /><br />

				I have helicopter awareness!&nbsp; I should actually know a lot more than what I listed.&nbsp; Basically, if they are flying low and in circles I would assume it&#039;s police, and be careful.&nbsp; If they really want people off the street they&#039;ll announce it over a bull horn - you&#039;re being careful not to run into someone with a gun.&nbsp; By the way, they could also just be looking for a lost child.

				No - think about it - it&#039;s very expensive to operate a helicopter.&nbsp; The police are not going to bring one out for every occasion.&nbsp; Something serious had to have happened.&nbsp; If they&#039;re flying, you want them there.&nbsp; <br /><br />Consider a 3 year old that wanders away quietly in Astoria Park.&nbsp; Is this kid expressing his or her rights to explore the universe?&nbsp; Or should we take steps to make sure our happy wanderer doesn&#039;t fall in the river or get swept up by someone evil?

				I think we also see an increase in helicopter traffic in the summertime when the rich and fabulous copter out of Manhattan en route to their Hamptons getaways. Y&#039;know, those people who are too rich and fabulous for that Hamptons bus or LIRR, but don&#039;t want to get stuck in traffic.<br /><br />But yeah, we&#039;re also right on the flightpath of LGA/Marine Air terminal so if they&#039;re in a holding pattern, they hold over Astoria (unlike planes which circle, the copters can just kind of hover or circle smaller areas).<br /><br />One thing I like about summer -- no more waking up at 6 a.m. to helicopter traffic because the bedroom air conditioner drowns out the noise.

				It could just be that since it&#039;s warm out, we&#039;re all spending more time outdoors and noticing them more.<br /><br />There&#039;s 3 categories of &#039;copter in my mind, in this order of frequency:<br /><br />1)Those going to and from laguardia<br />2)News helicopters, often around when there&#039;s some fire, huge traffic, etc. <br />3)The police... which I can&#039;t say I&#039;ve noticed around much. &#039;Aviation&#039; usually goes buzzing around if they are looking for some violent perp in the area that just commited a crime. <br /><br />

				Friends,<br />&nbsp; Is it me or does there seem to be a lot a police activity in the skies over Astoria lately.<br />&nbsp; I agree that we&#039;re in the flight path for &#039;copters ferrying the rich into Manhattan.&nbsp; But, this is not what I&#039;m talking about.<br />&nbsp; There seems to have been a lot police helicopters in sky trying to track down an offender lately.&nbsp; I&#039;m not saying that this is inappropriate, but I&#039;ve been noticing this more and more lately.<br />&nbsp; Is crime increasing in Astoria?&nbsp; Just a few weeks ago, I witnessed the NYPD SWAT Team deployed to a building a few blocks from me (42nd St. and 25th Ave.)<br />&nbsp;What&#039;s going on?

				I live near the Triboro and have often been awakened by the traffic &#039;copters doing their morning reports. Fun&nbsp; :-P <br /><br />Lately, been staying @ the BF&#039;s in Flushing, where he lives directly beneath the landing path of LGA. Last night, was awoken by a jet that seemed especially close- like, you can hear the mechanics of the landing gear close. Waited for the other jets to start approaching (1min 45sec apart) but it was completely silent. Couldn&#039;t get back to sleep after that.

				I hear what you guys are saying about the police, the news, the rich guys... but it really seems to me that the traffic above has increased a great deal. Today, relaxing (or trying to) at home, there was a constant blare of spinning blades above. No one else sees (hears) this cacophonous maelstrom? Pay attention the next few days.

				As for the helicopters over 30th ave festival; National Geographic has a booth up for geneology and there is a big line for it.&nbsp; There is also a small film crew plus a camera up on a jib to shoot from different heights. That&#039;s when we saw a black helicopter with camera pod coming down to swoop the avenue from the 40&#039;s aiming down to 31st street.&nbsp; Very very cool.

				I&#039;m glad someone posted about the helicopter noise this morning!&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t believe how loud they were - I live on 30th Ave. and Crescent - and I was convinced that war had broken out!&nbsp; Something about the noise of these helicopters was different...they sounded more like what I imagine military helicopters would sound like.&nbsp; Although maybe it was just that they&#039;ve never been so close before.<br /><br />Does anyone know if something was happening in the area this morning?&nbsp;

				Come to think of it, we heard them too- I peeked out the window but didn&#039;t see them as close to us (we&#039;re near the Triboro). Figured it was morning traffic reports and went back to sleep. Sounds like they were closer to you guys.......for a change!

				A couple of observations:<br /><br />Whenever I hear the helicopters I can look out of my window and see them - they are usually above the RFK Bridge going towards The Bronx or hovering over the Grand Central / BQE.&nbsp; My front windows face the RFK and my back windows face the GCP etc.&nbsp; They sound a lot closer than they actually are.&nbsp; They do not move around too much.&nbsp; A few times, I was able to correlate this with traffic reports and noticed that whenever there was an accident reported on 1010 WINS on the GCP, BQE or RFK, the helicopters would be hovering right above.<br /><br />Secondly, although I am not sure whether we are still using the color coded terrorist alerts, at work we have been told by the FBI who visited recently that they are being extra vigilant.<br /><br />
