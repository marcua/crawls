				I was surprised, too.&nbsp; Other people have been convicted of crimes on circumstantial evidence.&nbsp; But I guess the jury chose not to base a guilty on &quot;<em>she probably</em> did it&quot;.<br /><br /><br />I wonder about two things: 1. Should she have been tried for something else - a different charge.&nbsp; 2. Should penalties always be assessed separately from trials of guilt - if a death penalty not been involved, would she have been found guilty.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Starwind, I think you bring up two strong points, and both have been commented on only occasionally in the media. First I agree that the prosecutor pressed charges that were too much to be able to prove, without a reasonable doubt. I think that is the part that 99% of the outraged Nancy Grace types have missed.&nbsp; Had she been charged with something like criminally negligent homicide and tampering with evidence, I think she&#039;d be behind bars right now. Murder 1 is a very difficult thing to prove, but I never followed the case close enough to be able to point out the missing links. <br />Secondly, I think that the death penalty is also something that certainly played a part. Personally, I would rather have a guilty person walk free, than have an innocent person killed (I don&#039;t want to see the guilty killed either, but that&#039;s beside the point). As a juror, knowing that a case that seemed to have its fair share of holes would end a persons life, I can&#039;t say I&#039;d vote to convict. <br />I think that Casey Anthony probably did it, hot or not, but this is how the legal system works.

				Seemed like many were rooting against her side like it was a sports contest, and they were rabid fans for prosecutors.&nbsp; Now some are going after&nbsp; jury, and protesting verdict.&nbsp; &nbsp;Nancy Grace wants to shoot everyone with out a trial.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They also now want to go after her when released.&nbsp; Take her money, fine her, and so on.&nbsp; 12 jurors found her not guilty, obviously we were only hearing one side of trial.
