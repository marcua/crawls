Some cultures have their own types of foods. Why would someone make fun of someone else&#039;s cuisine?&nbsp; Even America has it&#039;s own wacky foods which people in other countries would find appalling to eat( fat rich).<br />&nbsp; <br /><br />BTW oxtail soup is also eaten in the middle east.( Israel by way of Iraq, and Lebanon by way of Syria)

				I suspect the frozen guinea pig is an Ecuadoran delicacy, unless they eat it elsewhere.&nbsp; I remember being rather surprised when offered gui (I think that&#039;s the spelling) when I was in Quito.

				oh, i&#039;m half ecuadorian / half peruvian.<br /><br />the first time i had guinea pig ( in spanish it&#039;s pronounced &#039;coo-eee&#039; ) i had it in Peru, Pascasmayo to be exact. my aunt has a little farm and raises guinea pigs and they eat it and sell some. ( i suppose this can be kinda lucrative... those things have babies all the time!) tastes just like chicken. seriously! a little dry tho.&nbsp; <br /><br />iguana soup. i dont know if i&#039;d enjoy that... i find it interesting that trader joe&#039;s has it....
