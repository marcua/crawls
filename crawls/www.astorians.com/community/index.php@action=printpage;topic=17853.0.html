				Do I like long shots. You know I do. I also like folks who proudly exercise their Rights.<br /><br /><br />http://randycredico2010.org/?p=469<br /><br />This is a long piece. Some of it is actually a funny read. Not sure how many ballot lines this Randy is seeking but I do hope he makes statewide later this year. Unless you are giving to another candidate, hope you may spare a signature or benjamins for RC.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Asked why he isn’t running against Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, who is considered more vulnerable than Schumer, Credico said it’s because his friend Jonathan Tasini is challenging her — and also, Credico quipped, because if he ran against Gillibrand and beat her, then he’d “have to be in the Senate for six years with Chuck Schumer.”<br /><br />Credico said he’s eager to debate Schumer, but suspects the senator will duck his offer. So he’s working on his Chuck Schumer impersonation — and, if necessary, will debate himself.<br /><br />Ballot hurdle<br />Credico says he has raised $20,000 in campaign funds, which obviously pales compared to the millions in Schumer’s war chest. However, Credico’s more immediate challenge is getting his name on the Democratic primary ballot in September. He needs to collect 15,000 petition signatures statewide. But he’s confident he’ll do it.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />&quot;I’m considered a lefty Libertarian.”<br /><br /><br />http://randycredico2010.org/

				<br />No. It was a late notice and not possible to attend everything that I would like to.<br />Have been to a few like events, and expect to cross his paths later this year.<br /><br />Very curious about the cafe though. Eating pizza never gets old for me.<br /><br />It may be quite hard for candidates like him to achieve every ballot plan. It depends on how satisfied party members are with incumbents and if they want primaries. I think it would be good for the Senators to be challenged. But with appreciation that some may want to focus more on the general election.<br /><br />
