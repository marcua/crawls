				I have this *thing* about plastic bags. Drives me nuts the more I obtain. <br /><br />Like everybody else, I hoard them and use them for small wastebaskets in the house. But I&#39;m also a little obsessed about avoiding them whenever possible.<br /><br />For example, when I know I&#39;m going to Fairway or for a bunch of groceries, I bring the granny bag (you know, that big plastic monstrosity w/the zipper that fits in the granny cart.) That thing is amazing- like ten little bags&#39; worth of space, at least. I love seeing how much I can cram in there.&nbsp; :evil:<br /><br />But like everybody else, I don&#39;t always plan ahead and often find myself at the store sans granny bag. If I&#39;m getting a couple of small items that fit in the purse, I have to practically jump up and down and yell, &quot;NO BAG! NO BAG!&quot; Some cashiers think I&#39;m nuts, guess they don&#39;t understand how I could walk out of a store with a naked item in hand. Won&#39;t people think I stole it??&nbsp; :roll: That&#39;s what the receipt is for.<br /><br />Today I got stuck without a bag and bought a loaf of bread. Figured I had more stuff to buy anyway so I took it out in a bag. Turns out she had <em>double-bagged it</em>......one stupid loaf of bread!&nbsp; :-o<br /><br />Anyway. How many paragraphs is that about bags?&nbsp; :-P Needed to rant about this, tired of feeling like a freak just b/c I <em>DON&#39;T WANT </em> TEN THOUSAND PLASTIC BAGS PER ITEM!!!! <br /><br />Oh yeah, to add insult to injury: I see that my roommate has a box of small trash bags&nbsp; :| For the love of all that is good and holy, <span class="bbc_u">WHY?!</span><br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />

				Haha, I hear ya on the bags - they do tend to annoyingly build up, and they&#39;re such a waste, especially with the double bagging (unless you&#39;re walking a long way with heavy stuff, you don&#39;t need it double bagged).<br /><br />If you want, the supermarket near my parents house has a bin out front for recycling them, I can bring them back and dump them all in there :) I&#39;ve been going back quite a bit lately for this school project thing I&#39;ve been working on.

				Oh that&#39;s so sweet of you! But it&#39;s not necessary: When we have a LOT of bags, I become that much more motivated; as they run out, then I slack off a bit.<br /><br />I&#39;m hoping that I&#39;m not the only one that feels this way (of course I&#39;m not.) I just like to bring it up from time to time so that we can all feel a little less like freaks while out shopping. The more we do it, the more likely cashiers will understand and make it a little easier.

I often times bring my cart or a backpack and start packing things in so they don&#39;t waste my time with bags (I mean if it&#39;s something that might rip and spill, one bag is ok but the amount of bags wasted is ridiculous... Yes, I do get weird looks sometimes but whatever.

				Hellgate CSA - www.hellgatecsa.com<br /><br />Members are encouraged to bring their own bags to vegetable distribution every week, but there are usually *some* bags on hand in the event that people forget. So any donation of bags is always greatly appreciated!! :)
