				Oh, lordy. Male orange tabby approx. 3 months old&nbsp; :-(<br /><br />Just brought him inside and put him in a spare office. He&#039;s got a white bib and paws, very sweet disposition. We were able to cradle him in our arms like the baby boy that he is, no biting or skittishness......although he is hiding under the desks in the office at the moment.<br /><br />This one might already have a home, but just in case......!

				Co-worker who thought she could take kitten now says she can&#039;t. I am dying to take him b/c he&#039;s so cool and sweet, but I have an ornery one and my roommate has a sick one. And since we rent, that makes it even harder.<br /><br />If you want to take him for a &quot;test drive,&quot; at least a place to stay for the night. Don&#039;t know why it&#039;s such a big deal to keep a kitten in the office overnight.

				That&#039;s okay! You guys have your hands full.<br /><br />A co-worker took him home for the night. Somebody else e-mailed some photos of him but I couldn&#039;t post them online or even copy/paste them anywhere. Tomorrow he&#039;s back at work. <br /><br />When I last checked, he was curled up on a desk, sleeping VERY soundly (doing the whisker-twitching kitty dream state thing.) A couple of us were petting him for a while before he even stirred.....then started purring like a motorboat.<br /><br />The problem seems to be a bunch of kittens over at the garage next door to the building. Must be an abandoned litter? I&#039;m not sure.

				A co-worker took the cat home for the evening, and here&#039;s the latest report:<br /><br /><em>Our cat finally found a home someone from here actually took him He and his new family are very happy. <br /><br />They have a little girl of 5yr old so he definitely have someone to play with.</em><br /><br />While I&#039;m happy, I hope they neuter him ASAP and are a good family. When people take kittens home for the entertainment of their kids, I worry!<br />

				<em>Our daughter was in Awe, and totally loves her new friend.&nbsp; She has named him Zing.&nbsp; We took him to the pet shop on College Point Blvd, and they took care of his eyes and helped us to pick a flea treatment...just in case.&nbsp; Zing seemed very happy in his new home.&nbsp; He went to the pet potty right away, and ate a lot of the free samples of food that we were given in the pet shop.&nbsp; Then he disappeared for about 4 hours...came out...and proceeded to try to eat our feet!&nbsp; LOL! Such fun...He will go for his distemper on sat...Thank you for caring about the little kitten. And thanks for letting me have him for our daughter.&nbsp; We will send you a pic soon...</em> <br /><br />That&#039;s the orange tabby update, but I won&#039;t rest until he&#039;s been fixed. I&#039;m used to interviewing people at the shelter, so letting one go to a home sight unseen is frustrating.......

				Okay, I&#039;m told that Zing is going to be neutered at some point, hopefully sooner than later.&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />And yes, I realize I&#039;m pretty much talking to myself in this thread&nbsp; :idiot: :crazy:

				No you&#039;re not. People are listening/reading. There is just no reason to comment, until now! I understand your concern. You&#039;re good people, Christine.

				NYCMac -- do you know anything about low cost spay/neuter clinics in queens?&nbsp; one of the requirements of the new kitten homes are spay/neuter, shots -- but my vet is not low cost so would be nice to know of something more budget friendly to recommend.<br /><br />cheers,<br />jayme

				Word on the street is that the ASPCA does it for free. My guess is that they would like some kind of donation, though. Still a good deal!

The only free one I know of is on Staten Island. I believe, that 2 or 3 of the larger Manhattan hospitals do offer low cost spay.neuter, but it usualy is done on a sliding (income/assets) scale. I personally would not look for inexpensive. I would look for good and less expensive. The new formula for spay/neuter is 2 months or 2 pounds, whichever comes first. My vet of 30+ years refused to spay my Affen because she was only 2.3 pounds and it would require a microscopic surgical procedure. He referred me to a Manhattan vet who wanted $850 to do it. I found out that he donated his service at the ASPCA Hospital 1 day a week, arranged to have her done there, and the same $850 vet did her for $345. I would only have wished he would have done one of *my* surgeries. There is no evidence of a scar. <br /><br />Good luck on finding someone you trust. Be sure to build a relationship with your vet. It always pays off in the end.
