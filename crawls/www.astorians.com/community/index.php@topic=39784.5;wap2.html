			Didn&#039;t some Pet place open down around 33rd/35th Street or something?

			That&#039;s Disco Paws. It didn&#039;t open yet

			I think Disco Paws opened about a week ago, on Ditmars near 34th or so.<br /><br />I hope to god the &#039;Voodoo&#039; place doesn&#039;t also become a pet-centric place, as that just signals the further gentrification of the nabe.&nbsp; <br /><br />The person who told me it would be an Irish pub sounded quite sure of her sources...&nbsp; ;-)
