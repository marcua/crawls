				Hi,<br /><br />My friend&#039;s oldest child, an 11-year old boy, may be attending IS 126 in September. He was supposed to have had a choice<br />between 122 and 204, but because his mother didn&#039;t bother following up on paperwork, this was his only choice.<br /><br />126 always had a bad reputation when I was growing up in the late 70&#039;s, early 80&#039;s. My mom actually went back to work<br />to pay for me to go to private school, but that&#039;s another story. Since then, I&#039;ve heard mixed things, but never anything positive. <br /><br />Does anyone have a child there now or had one attend there recently? My friend is worried about his son going there<br />but neither of us knows anyone who might be able to alleviate or confirm his concerns.<br /><br />Thanks very much.<br /><br />

				To be honest, we applied to other schools to avoid having our son having to go to 126, which is also our zoned school.&nbsp; (Fortunately he was accepted to a citywide school in Manhattan and will be starting there in September for 6th grade.)&nbsp; I&#039;m sorry to tell you that I.S. 126 still has a bad reputation but several of my son&#039;s classmates are going there in September and they are good kids who just didn&#039;t get any of their choices on the middle school application process.&nbsp; We also know some parents who are putting their kids in Catholic school to avoid 126.<br /><br />The good news is that 126 has a new principal who came last year and he is really trying to turn things around.&nbsp; He visited my son&#039;s school and talked to the kids and then also came and spoke to the parents and he seemed sincere about wanting to improve the school and change its reputation.&nbsp; Maybe your friend can contact the principal and see if what he has to say eases his concerns.&nbsp; Also, if the child has good grades, there are several 7-12 public schools that he can apply to if he can stick it out at 126 for one year.<br /><br />Hope this helps!&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I can&#039;t speak to the academics, but I can tell you that the school has a reputation for not being especially safe. <br /><br />Things have changed A LOT since I went there 25+ years ago.

				I went to school there in the late 80s and did well I was in one of those SP classes and skipped 7th. Its all in the teachers and how you well you teach them at home to stay on course.&nbsp; speak to the teachers find out who&#039;s there if thats your only choice and yes getting jumped then was a weekly affair along with ..........&nbsp; well we were all quite tortured there. :crazy:

				Thanks everyone for your replies and input. I&#039;ve also spoken to a few people and&nbsp; no one is<br />very enthusiastic about the school. Supposedly the new principal is already not as enthusiastic<br />to implement the changes he talked about when he took over.<br /><br />My friend is exploring other options to see what&#039;s possible.<br /><br />Thanks again!
