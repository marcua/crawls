				Anyone have any recommendations for post 11pm dining in the W. or E. 50&#39;s or low 60&#39;s?&nbsp; We&#39;re going to Carnegie Hall tonight and will want to eat afterward, but not stray too far off the path that leads back to A-town.<br />thx<br />bt

				Never been to HK but it does look interesting.&nbsp; I&#39;ve never actually eaten on 7th ave in that area except for that one Thai place right by the subway entrance (I thought it was bland).&nbsp; I guess the Redeye diner would work in a pinch.&nbsp; Where did you guys wind up going?

				The Brooklyn Diner on 57th St is okay but not cheap in a pinch.&nbsp; What did you end up trying?

				I really like Hell&#39;s Kitchen, too.&nbsp; First place I ever had huitlacoche (that would be corn smut); now I look for it anyplace I can.&nbsp; (Tacos Mexico does a decent huitlacoche quesadilla).<br /><br />But yes, where did you go?&nbsp; That late there&#39;s not much that&#39;s decent immediately around Carnegie Hall that I can think of.&nbsp;
