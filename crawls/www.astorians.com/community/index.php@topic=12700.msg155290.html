								<div class="inner" id="msg_155099">This is pretty sad. Colin Powell just endorsed Obama on Meet The Press, which isn&#039;t the sad part. I wanted to look around at the news that&#039;s going up about this to see what people&#039;s responses are, mainly in the comments sections because that&#039;s where you get an idea of each party&#039;s talking points. Of course, the Obama supporters are happy that he endorsed Obama, as McCain&#039;s supporters would&#039;ve been if he&#039;d supported McCain. Despite the Iraq war, Powell is still seen as one of the more respectable figures in politics. More of my concern was if the crazier Republicans would start discrediting Powell&#039;s views and opinion immediately. <br /><br />I&#039;m not seeing a whole lot of people saying things like &quot;Well that&#039;s too bad. I generally respect Powell&#039;s opinion, but I disagree with him on this.&quot; What I am seeing is stuff like &quot;Obama and Powell are Black. Is this NEWS,&quot; &quot;Had Powell endorsed McCain he would be accused of being an Uncle Tom by the left wing lunatics, many here assembled,&quot; and &quot;Shame on Colin Powell for endorsing a Chicago thug with ties to Ayers, Pfleger, and Rev Wright--American haters.&quot; Those are exact quotes. This is the stuff that&#039;s destroying the Republican party at this point, and I blame McCain for this with the tone of hate his campaign took on a couple weeks ago. It&#039;s going to be hard for them to shake that. <br /><br />While I admittedly don&#039;t have a whole lot of Republican friends and family members (not on purpose, mind you), the ones I do have are not happy with McCain and especially don&#039;t like Sarah Palin. In their attempts to paint Obama as a Muslim terrorist as well as their going right along with all these bank bailouts and buyouts, the Republican party doesn&#039;t seem to have much of a defined platform anymore aside from this relatively new &quot;family values&quot; thing that lures in the evangelicals, and the idea of small town people being superior to those elitist coastal liberals. How do the Republicans here feel about this? Do you truly like McCain/Palin and the direction the party has taken in recent months/years, or do you feel like the party is losing it?</div>

And who are you to judge what the &quot;mainstream Americans&quot; believe? The belief structure is far too vast to try to lump something in a small box. The same as abortion issues, religion has far too many points of view. What makes Wright&#039;s comments any less divisive than many of the white pastors from these midwestern mega-churches?<br /><br />And calling Ayers Obama&#039;s educational adviser? Come on, that&#039;s a stretch.&nbsp; They served on the same board. That&#039;s a far cry from Ayers being his educational adviser.&nbsp; He&#039;s not in any way associated with Obama&#039;s campaign.<br /><br />And as far as why Powell&#039;s endorsement carries far more weight than Leiberman&#039;s? That&#039;s easy. Lieberman has proven time and again he is a political opportunist and will do anything he can to get elected and push his own agenda, while Powell has consistency of declining to run for public office when he could have, and probably would have been president had he chosen to run.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_155305">While we have differing political perspectives, please billz even you have to see there is something terribly wrong with the Republican party and this campaign.<br /><br />I agree that the McCain campaign proper is not painting Obama as a terrorist. That’s because the McCain campaign proper is essentially over. It’s been taken away from him, not by Barack Obama but the Republican Party itself. What we’re seeing now is the Palin 2012 campaign and based on my initial perceptions, it’s not going to be pretty.<br /><br />What Palin and the Republican party leadership is doing is reprehensible. Labeling Obama as ‘not one of us’ has many implications, at the least that he’s un-American and at worse a terrorist. The man was elected to the United States Senate and deserves a level of respect. To attack him with innuendo because of his name and to stoke the flames of bigotry is indefensible. <br /><br />Palin knows exactly what’s she doing and McCain does too, otherwise he wouldn’t have back-pedalled on some of her statements. Being promptly boo-ed for doing so by the party faithful was very telling for me. You may label them at crazy right-wing wackos but they seem ordinary to me – that’s the frightening part.<br /><br />As far as the ‘coastal elites’ are concerned, they may not have a clue but neither does Middle America. Last time I checked John McCain, a product of middle America had a much larger fortune and lifestyle than Barack Obama, also a product of Middle Amercia and to say either of them knows about the lives of an average Joe from anywhere in this country is a joke. <br /><br />And for all the talk of the bias of the coastal elites, I hope the irony of Sarah’s pallin’ around appearance on SNL, the un-American bastion of media elitism, isn’t lost on American public.<br /><br /></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_155312">Can you be specific in regard to what you consider tyranny? <br /><br />Do you really think an Obama administration will actually be worse than Bush’s ‘miss-steps’?<br /><br />If you consider dismantling the American system of checks and balances, the foundation of our government and what makes our nation great, a miss-step then I don’t know what to think.&nbsp; <br /><br />Yelling out ‘terrorist’ at a McCain rally is not McCain’s fault and to his credit he has tried to rebuke people for doing so. Sarah Palin, darling of the Republican party, has not and seems to be encouraging such behavior. If she is the Republican’s ideal future, then I’m truly fearful.<br /><br />McCain is the problem with McCain. Many people consider him to be a political opportunist as well. His wavering commitment to the Republican party after the 2000 [edit] presidential campaign, the ‘will he’ or ‘won’t he’ defect to the Democrats drama didn’t sit well with many people in either party. I used to have great respect for the man but he’s greatly diminished in my view after his actions during the 2004 campaign. McCain’s kow-towing to and his complete turn-around in support for Bush, especially in light of the smear campaign that Bush waged in 2000 was extremely disappointing and very un-maverick. <br /><br />One thing we can agree on: McCain isn’t an extension of Bush -- he’s worse. McCain sold out his principles to keep his seat at the table.<br /></div>

So much of what he does and has done, imho, has been purely political expedience, and not necessarily true substance.<br /><br />And yeah, there are some questions in my mind about a super majority, but I guess I kind of view the possibility of it as a balance to the last 8 (well, 6.5) years of Republican rule. Bring things back to equilibrium.&nbsp; Hopefully balance out the supreme court again, and as mentioned, checks and balances, which have been shredded by the signing statements Bush has employed so regularly.</div>

His admission to the Navel academy was out of his family background. He had the opportunity to be released as a POW early because of his family (and to his absolute credit passed that chance up, I don&#039;t know I would be able to do the same). And his current wealth, which far exceeds Obama&#039;s.<br /><br />Why is higher education so frowned upon in this country? The fact that Obama went to Harvard being a black flag against him is just crazy to me.<br /><br />&quot;Oh no! Fear the intellectually curious at all costs!!!&quot;</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_155317">This wasn&#039;t meant to be another McCain vs Obama thread. This was meant to be an Individual Republicans vs The Republican Party thread. I don&#039;t expect any true Republicans to be thrilled by Obama. I expect more of them to sooner not vote at all or maybe vote for a third party candidate, the way a lot of Democrats who weren&#039;t thrilled by Al Gore voted for Nader in 2000. I still find it sad that a lot of people are discrediting Powell&#039;s opinion because of his race, and it&#039;s not just random internet wackos; it&#039;s Rush Limbaugh and now some columnist from the Kansas City Star (it popped up on Google News). It&#039;s as if Powell said nothing to explain his reasoning or his line of thought. These idiots just see a black man supporting another black man.<br /><br />Regarding this, Billz: &quot;As far as small town America, the point, or at least the perception, is that the coastal elites don&#039;t have any idea what life is like there.&nbsp; You just said yourself that you know only a handful of Republicans.&quot; You missed my point there. My point was that I don&#039;t like anyone who runs for president that tries to pit these two demographics against each other, because many small town folks also don&#039;t know what life is like where I live, and they don&#039;t have a lot of liberal buddies of the likes that live in a place like New York City - it goes both ways. Powell addressed this in his endorsement on Meet the Press, about how damaging it is to America as a whole to go along campaigning this way, as if the small towns are the ones that really matter, and the suggestion that those people are the true Americans. It&#039;s insulting, not only to the millions of &quot;true Americans&quot; who do not live in small town America, but to the intelligence of the people being spoken to. <br /><br />I also disagree that the McCain campaign proper isn&#039;t trying to paint Obama as a Muslim terrorist. Why do you think they keep pounding this Bill Ayers issue into the ground? It certainly isn&#039;t because of his education policies or because he protested the Vietnam war. It&#039;s because they get to say that Obama pals around with terrorists - and, BECAUSE OF 9/11, the people who are more impressionable by this political attack will automatically think Muslim terrorist, because these same people are afraid that Obama is a Muslim. Like Powell said, it&#039;s demagoguery. </div>
