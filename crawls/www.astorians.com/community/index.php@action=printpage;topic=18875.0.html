				I think about ready to agree with just about anything anyone says about the nuts in the neighborhood.<br /><br />I arrived at La Guardia this morning with a suitcase, a stuffed backpack, another bag, and my two canes.&nbsp; I took the 33 around to the start of the Q69 run (Astoria Blvd at 82nd St).&nbsp; A man was already at the stop and he commented to me about what a hot day it was already.&nbsp; This was a perfectly normal conversation because it <em>was</em> a hot day.&nbsp; It was also the end of the conversation because there was nothing else to say.&nbsp; He walked around trying to get through to someone on his cell phone, and I went around to the other side of the bus stop so I would be in the shade.&nbsp; A moment later a bummy looking guy comes up to me and comments that I have a lot of bags.&nbsp; If someone said this outside of Associated (21st St and Broadway) the comment would have been followed up with an offer to help me with my bags, for money.&nbsp; Not this guy.&nbsp; He keeps talking to me as if trying to make friendly conversation (where are you going?&nbsp; are you coming back from a trip?) but he keeps eyeing the other man who&#039;s walking around, as if tryng to assess whether or not the man can see him, which makes me think this bummy looking guy is going to try to steal my bags or do something else to rob me.&nbsp; I moved away - better to wait in the hot sun than take a chance on this guy.&nbsp; But really, 8:30 on a Sunday morning, I just got back, and I have to deal with a nut already?&nbsp; But he wasn&#039;t the only one.&nbsp; The start of the Q69 run is always fairly empty of passengers, and often stays that way till 31st Street.&nbsp; And as you might guess, that was true of this early Sunday morning.&nbsp; So I got on the bus (the cell phone guy spontaneously helped me with my bags) and I sat on the first sideways bench seat (diagonally opposite the driver) with my roller suitcase secured between my knees, my two canes in my hand, my fully stuffed backpack on the seat next to me, and my other bag on the seat after that.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t ordinarily spread my stuff out like that, but as I said, this was early Sunday morning and bus was nearly empty.&nbsp; When we arrived at 31st Street the 3 bench seats opposite me were empty, and pretty much the rest of the bus was empty, but this nut gets on and she HAS to sit in that third bench seat where my third bag is.&nbsp; I point to the 3 empty seats opposite and tell her how empty the rest of the bus is.&nbsp; But no, this nut has to have <em>that</em> seat and keeps raving on about it.&nbsp; I know she has the legal right to sit in that seat as it wasn&#039;t being occupied by a person, but I think only a nut would insist upon it.&nbsp; And encountering 2 nuts in the space of 5 minutes when I&#039;ve just traveled a few thousand miles without meeting one makes this an excessive amount of nuts in the neighborhood.

				We encountered a nut in the store the other day-some bummy guy who was trying to drum up a conversation with my 5 year old and basically encouraging my son to shoplift whatever it was that he wanted since I wouldn&#039;t buy it for him. They are everywhere. They look for people like us-people with lots of baggage, kids, etc. because we are easier to prey on than someone who can just walk away easily. Be careful out there.

				Maybe you&#039;re just paranoid.&nbsp; And someone who insists on sitting at a particular section of the bus shouldn&#039;t be called a &quot;nut&quot;.&nbsp; It may just be a simple OCD or something.&nbsp; We all have our little quirks, don&#039;t we, StarWind?&nbsp; Oh, and some people who see a person with &quot;a suitcase, a stuffed backpack, another bag, and two canes&quot; on an empty bus might think of that person as homeless and possibly a &quot;nut&quot;.<br /><br />And with your history, StarWind, would they be too far off?&nbsp; You&#039;re the one who takes cold medicine then &quot;sees&quot; leaf-colored dogs in piles of leaves, right???<br /><br />http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=16778.0<br /><br />!

				If you cannot afford to save yourself the trouble of lugging all that luggage on a bus, and cannot instead afford an inexpensive cab ride between LaGuardia and Astoria, be prepared to interact with undesireables.

				Seriously, a $7 cab ride is worth my sanity to lug all that crap on the bus so early in the morning.

				I&#039;ve lived here all my life, I was coming home from vacation.&nbsp; This is the same bus route I travel every day going to work, so I know the convenience, and $2.25 is an excellent price for just about door-to-door service.&nbsp; Since I travel this route all the time I&#039;ve witnessed this woman before, and she&#039;s been a nut on other occasions.&nbsp; Glad that you&#039;re a fan and &quot;follow me&quot;, Queenzbwai, you make me feel like a &quot;Star&quot;!
