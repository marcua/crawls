				My class had our big pastry buffet last week at the Art Institute and if you ask me, our stuff came out pretty darn great.&nbsp; I&#39;m a terrible photographer, but the food still looks quite delectable.&nbsp; I put the pictures on Snapfish, so please feel free to view, and then post compliments here.&nbsp; &nbsp;:wink:<br /><br />http://www2.snapfish.com/thumbnailshare/AlbumID=44409899/a=53262918_53262918/fromupload=true/t_=53262918

				Haha!&nbsp; You crack me up, flooz!&nbsp; <br /><br />To answer your question, it&#39;s a thin layer of genoise-type spong cake on the outside and underneath, and the filling is a raspberry bavarian cream (raspberry puree, creme anglaise, whipped cream, gelatin).&nbsp; &quot;The mirroir&quot; is a glaze made from more raspberry puree, sugar syrup, and gelatin.&nbsp; Sanesha (a lady in my class) made it and she did an amazing job.&nbsp; It was delicious.<br /><br />Thanks, flooz!

Which ones did you work on?<br /><br />Oh, and it&#39;s easy to rotate photos in Snapfish. Viewing the album, there should be an option to rotate photos on the right side of the screen. It lets you do them all at once, so it&#39;s fast...

				Thanks, Harlan.<br /><br />I did the Danish and the coconut macaroons.&nbsp; And, if I may brag for just a second, when asked by a buffet attendee which of the items presented actually took the most effort, the chef replied, &quot;the Danish.&nbsp; It takes a good three days to do it right.&quot; So I was right proud of myself.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				I am never gonna cook like that again. No ambition or motivation. But, I do like to eat. I am, however, terribly jealous of your photography. I can&#39;t get picture like that. Great job, Michelle. A cook who can photograph food. You&#39;ve got a real future. <br /><br />I guess I can start practicing on takeout! <br />&nbsp;:?

				Wow JD, those look great!<br /><br />We talked about jeans but not your cooking classes on Saturday. I meant to ask you about them -- what&#39;s the story? Where are you taking them? Are you working toward some sort of certification/degree? What do you hope to do with it? I am completely dumb (and very curious) about this stuff...<br /><br />Meanwhile, seeing that pretty pecan pie reminded me that I make a decent pie too. Maybe THAT&#39;S what I&#39;ll bring to the baking party!&nbsp; :-D

				Thanks for all the nice compliments, folks!&nbsp; They are greatly appreciated (so keep &#39;em coming)! :wink:<br /><br />I&#39;ll be done with classes in December, and will hopefully be hired on full time by whatever establishment at which I will have done my externship . . . unless I hate it, of course.&nbsp; It&#39;s a certificate program in Pastry Arts, so it&#39;s just a 4-quarter program, but I&#39;ll only be taking 3 quarters to complete it since I have a lot of credits that transfer from my old school, The Art Institute of California - Orange County.&nbsp; The school here, The Art Institute of New York City (formerly the New York Restaurant School) is in a big building at Canal and Varick Streets.&nbsp; Eventually, I&#39;d like to own a little patisserie, but that is years down the line.&nbsp; For now, I&#39;d just be really happy to earn a decent living (i.e. being able to at least pay rent) by working in a bakery or doing desserts for a hotel or restaurant.&nbsp; That will be my big task for when I get back here from my trip home - employment!!&nbsp; <br /><br />MandaT, I hope you do bring a pecan pie to our Bakers Anonymous meeting.&nbsp; It&#39;s my very favorite kind of pie!!<br /><br />Thanks again, you guys!!
