			<br />
			Boundless Tales, the longest-running reading series in the borough of Queens, is celebrating its five-year anniversary at Queens Council on the Arts. Founder and curator Aida Zilelian began the series with the goal of providing a venue for writers who are passionate about their writing, and who would like to share their work in a public forum. Alongside Aida, Audrey Dimola and Devin Doyle are hosts of the series, whose help and support in many other areas have helped Boundless grow into what it has now become. <br /><br />On Friday, September 9th, celebrate writers who have been featured at Boundless and who represent a strong diversity of writing. The participating writers are Jennifer Baker, Susana Case, Shakira Croce, Tim Fredrick, Leona Godin, Stephanie Laterza, Matthew Thorburn. Attendees will have the opportunity to pose questions to the writers and network with artists and community from across Queens. Admission is free to QCA members and $10 non-members.<br /><br /><br /><br />Friday, September 9, 2016, 6:30pm – 8:30pm<br /><br />Queens Council on the Arts<br />37-11 35th Ave, Entrance on 37th St<br />Astoria, NY 11101<br /><br />RSVP here: http://www.queenscouncilarts.org/calendar/2016/9/9/boundless-tales
