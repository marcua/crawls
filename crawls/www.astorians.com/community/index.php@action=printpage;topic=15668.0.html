				I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE JUMPING BULLDOG.&nbsp; My significant other did the work for the store and knows her personally.&nbsp; They are extremely caring, excellent.&nbsp; My cat got sick not too long ago, he got into a bag of catnip and they knew exactly what to do and kitty was fine by the evening.&nbsp; They have a lot of natural treats and always very helpful.&nbsp; You should stop by and check out the store and owners, you will be going back over and over again.<br />&nbsp;:-)<br /><br />
