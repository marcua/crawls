				I&#039;ve voted by absentee ballot every other time that I&#039;ve voted. This is the first time that I have ever gotten up early, walked to a poling place, waited in line, stepped through the curtains and pulled the levers of my choice.<br /><br />It was a very awe-inspiring experience. As I stood in line, awaiting my chance to vote, I was overcome with how happy I was to see so many people up and out so early to perform what I consider one of the most patriotic acts that an American citizen can perform. <br /><br />I am so happy to have went to an actual polling place to watch and be a part of this process. I am incredibly anxious and hopeful for the results, but I feel like I have a renewed faith in the people who live in my country. I sincerely believe that the turnout this year will be incredible and I am glad to see so many people voting.<br /><br />I want to know if you&#039;ve voted and where you went. Terrible lines? Friendly staff? How was your voting experience this election?

				It was crowded at the polling place and it took about an hour for me to vote. There were some annoying things - one of the coordinators doubled up our line b/c it was so long and there was only one booth for our district - but instead of having people who had been standing there for 45 minutes move up one to stand beside each other, she sent the newcomers down towards the front. No one was happy about that, but another polling worker sorted it out and said that those of us who had been standing longer would get to vote first. She was pretty awesome. <br /><br />I did get a little teary, to my surprise, to see all the people who came out to vote. It was, as you say, awe-inspiring. And I started thinking that, gee, I should vote more often (as in, for other elections). I know that we are expecting record turnout for this election, but I wonder if there will be an after-effect, if people will start voting more and being more involved after this is all over with?

				I voted. This is the third election I&#039;ve voted in Astoria, but the first Presidential election. I&#039;ve never seen that polling place so crowded - PS 85. But the wait wasn&#039;t as bad as I was mentally preparing myself for, and I was there for 30-45 minutes. I thought they managed the crowd pretty well. It definitely makes things easier if you bring that voter card in that people got in the mail.<br /><br />Is the Ditmars Starbucks doing the &quot;free coffee on election day&quot; thing? Because I want a free coffee, but I didn&#039;t see any signs there and felt weird about asking.

				I voted at PS 84 about half an hour ago.&nbsp; There were about 8 people on line for my district, which is more than I&#039;ve ever seen.&nbsp; There were two booths, though, so I waited probably less than 5 minutes overall.<br /><br />The eeriest part was that there&#039;s scaffolding all over the school, and the usual entrance - walking through the playground to the left of the building if you enter from 41st St. - was closed.&nbsp; You had to follow a construction tunnel around the school to the right, and it dredged up a shockingly clear memory of walking through the maze of Checkpoint Charlie when I crossed from West Berlin to East Berlin several times in the summer of 1989.&nbsp; It was a very odd feeling, especially as I was on my way to vote.<br /><br />It&#039;s easier to enter directly from the 42nd St. entrance.<br /><br />Essen - yup, it&#039;s free post-vote coffee day at Starbucks.&nbsp; I just went up to the counter and said, &quot;I just voted and I heard you&#039;re offering coffee.&quot;&nbsp; She smiled and poured me a&nbsp; coffee.&nbsp; &nbsp;:)

				I got to my polling site a bit after 6 a.m. and there was already a line almost to the end of the block (ending at 35th Avenue).&nbsp; It moved quickly and folks were very friendly, everyone was talking with folks around them and being excited.&nbsp; It was a moving experience.&nbsp; The poll workers were efficient, and even though there were lines inside, they did not take too long.&nbsp; A few people in my line had to get provisional ballots, but that did not delay us much.&nbsp; I saw two people I knew in the polling site and everyone was smiling, despite the throng of people - it&#039;s really how all elections should be, in my opinion.&nbsp; <br /><br />I got in and out quickly.&nbsp; I think the confusion with how to operate the voting machine slows people down - pulling the handle, then voting, then pulling it back. <br /><br />It was a nice morning and I can&#039;t wait to see the results tonight!

				I am not that religious, but I made the sign of the cross and then I voted.&nbsp; For someone who believes in the separation of Church and State, I felt so strongly about this election, that I have been praying!<br /><br />We waited 45 minutes this morning.&nbsp; District 23 seems to have the longest lines for some reason.&nbsp; Mom went later on (District 1) and the machine broke.&nbsp; She had to fill out a form.&nbsp; It took her two hours to get out of there.<br /><br />I hope to make it to Bohemian Hall later on.<br /><br />Keep the faith!

				Without getting into a huge debate about ID&#039;s, I believe the problem has been between the Democratic, often liberal side who argue that many poor voters (read: lower income African American and some Latino Democratic voters) do not have proper government identifications for any number of reasons (e.g. permament residence difficult to establish; cost of the ids; and for many poor rural voters, both white and black, but especially in the Delta, difficulty in getting to government offices); and conservative, mainly Republicans, who argue that the lack of ids have contributed to voter fraud in predominately poor areas.<br /><br />Is anybody advocating for a federal ID card?&nbsp; Is that what we need?&nbsp; As BStewart wrote, if someone will forge a signature, I&#039;m sure they would find some way to make a fake ID.&nbsp;

				I waited a little bit over an hour to vote early this morning, 40-50 people on my line. I had never waited more than 20 minutes in all the years I voted, so I was surprised to see only 1 voting machine for my election district, since they usually have 2 on presidential elections. Other districts with zero people waiting on line had 2 booths. I hope they added a second machine later on. I was happy to vote though, it was worth the wait.
