				I went through 4 years of college without ever hitting snooze, and I took a ton of 8:30 classes. However, having shown up for maybe the 100th time in a row late for work, I need some pointers. I have moved my alarm clock to the other side of the room, but it doesn&#039;t matter. I sleep walk over, turn it off, and get back into bed. Tonight I plan on setting my blackberry, cell, and clock all to go off at the same time and place them strategically throughout the room. Hopefully I will be wide awake at that point, otherwise I will have to make one of those elaborate clocks using an egg, pan, bowling ball, oscillating fan, and bucket of water, but that is last resort.

				One thing that helps me not be late in the morning (though I still hit snooze!) is setting my alarm clock 10-15 minutes fast. I forget- get up and leave the house earlier that I normally would. <br /><br />Do you stay up too late?

				Here&#039;s what I do--and I have to be out of the house by 6:10 every morning.<br /><br />I figure out the ideal time and the absolute latest time that I need to be up and then set three alarms. One for fifteen minutes before the ideal time, one at the ideal time and one for five minutes before absolute latest. I find that staggered alarms mean I&#039;m less likely to shut them all off.

				Another vote for setting multiple alarms - I purposefully set my alarm 20-30 minutes before I&#039;d actually like to get up so I can snooze a couple times. It&#039;s just physically impossible for my alarm to go off and wake up and get out of bed. I need that 20ish minutes (even if I fall back asleep, it&#039;s not a deep sleep) to ease myself into the day.<br /><br />Also, setting your clock fast works too. Even though you know it&#039;s 15 (or whatever) minutes ahead, it still helps. I have no idea why, but it works for me.

				Yeah.&nbsp; I just got a new mattress, and getting out of bed is even harder now.&nbsp; I only use 1 alarm and set it to go off about 20 minutes earlier than when I actually get up.

				I started having a lot of trouble getting up once I moved here, since I work from home full-time now. I started leaving my computer on and set it to play a few MP3s VERY LOUD. If it doesn&#039;t wake me up, it&#039;ll wake my roommates up and they&#039;ll kick me in the head. :-D

				Are you sure you&#039;re getting enough sleep?&nbsp; Maybe you suffer from sleep apnea or something that prevents your body from getting the rest it needs.&nbsp; Do you feel rested when you get out of bed?&nbsp; What about on weekends?&nbsp; Does your insurance cover doing a sleep study?&nbsp; It might tell you why you&#039;re not getting up.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m so not a morning person and need at least 20 minutes of psychological snooze time.&nbsp; When I&#039;m afraid of missing a flight, I set two alarms, stagger the times and out one across the room.&nbsp; One clock is set 10 minutes early but I find that it just makes me do early morning math in my head.&nbsp; I think if you set one across the room, once you are up, just force yourself to do anything else besides get back in bed.&nbsp; Go pee, make coffee, turn on a bunch of lights, splash water on your face -- anything besides getting back in bed.&nbsp; <br /><br />Have you looked into one of those services that calls you on the phone?

				We stagger our alarm time each day depending on meetings, gym etc.&nbsp; I find that by doing this - even by just a few minutes the chance of oversleeping decrease.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, if you get a lot of morning light opening the blinds just slightly before going to bed help you to wake up a little more easily and naturally.&nbsp; I am a really deep sleeper as well but these methods have worked for me.

				I set my alarm for 5:50, with the expectation that I&#039;ll get up at 6:30; usually I am up between 6:30 and 6:45.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been training myself to wake up early (I used to get up at 8!) since I started my job in December, and it&#039;s gotten easier as time has progressed.&nbsp; I also put on the radio as my alarm, fairly loudly, on a news channel (CBS news - sometimes NPR), so that the news engages my mind and I listen to the headlines, weather, sports.&nbsp; &nbsp;I like the radio better than an alarm, too.&nbsp; The alarm sound just pisses me off and gives me no incentive to stay awake.<br /><br />My goal is to be able to get up by 6am so that I can get more exercise.<br /><br />It&#039;s hard, though.&nbsp; But setting my alarm close to an hour before I need to be up has worked for me over the years.&nbsp; Good luck!

				Setting the clock funny never fooled me. In fact, it gives me a false sense of having lots of time.<br /><br />It is my understanding that Genghis Kahn, the night before a battle, required his men to drink an unusually large amount of water before going to sleep, so there would be some urgency to waking up in the morning.&nbsp; I have tried this on occasion with success.<br /><br />Alternately, neglect to feed the cat in the evening.

				I try to get up by 6:30 so that I can eat breakfast and either jog or ride my bike for 30 minutes before work.&nbsp; <br />The only effective method I&#039;ve found for getting out of bed is to set my clock 20 minutes ahead and force myself to get up when the first alarm goes off, otherwise I&#039;ll hit the snooze button for hours.

				I set my phone alarm and put it completely in the other room. It is loud enough, and irritating enough to get me out of bed...the cold floor usually wakes me up more, then I decide I have to go to the bathroom, by the time I&#039;m done with the distractions, I&quot;m awake...<br /><br />Also, getting pregnant is a surefire way to ensure that you are up...i sleep like s___.

				So last night i left my blackberry in my living room, my phone on my bureau, and my alarm clock on my desk, all set for 6. Another big difference, I no longer have my alarm clock set to radio, but rather that annoying beeping. The blackberry went off first, and in my urgency to get into the other room, i smashed my toe on the doorway. That woke me up for sure. The other 2 demon devices went off seconds later....

				Steve Pavlina&#039;s personal development blog has an article on training your subconscious mind to get you up when the alarm goes off: How to get up right away when your alarm goes off (http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2006/04/how-to-get-up-right-away-when-your-alarm-goes-off/)<br /><br />I haven&#039;t tried it myself, but you might find it interesting. Also related is this article: How to become an early riser (http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/05/how-to-become-an-early-riser/)<br /><br />Snooze is dangerous. I will almost always wake up when the initial alarm goes off but oddly I may not wake up for snooze alarms, or I may reset the clock or turn it off instead. It all depends on where in my sleep cycle the alarm comes... <br /><br />I also heard about a woman who got up early by promising herself that if she was still sleepy after her shower, she could go back to bed. The shower almost always gets my butt in gear.

				When I was in college, I worked in a bakery.&nbsp; A friggin&#039; bakery.&nbsp; I had to be there at 5:30am, which meant I had to wake up no later than 4:45am.&nbsp; That was insanely hard for me but the job was so entertaining, I got used to it and it didn&#039;t seem so hard after a while.&nbsp; Sure, I would have <em>rather</em> been sleeping but the thought of being at work didn&#039;t make me ignore three alarm clocks and stay in bed until I was late for work.&nbsp; Just my two cents.&nbsp; You&#039;ve pinpointed the reason you stay in bed as hating your job.&nbsp; Do you think it would be that way with a different job?&nbsp;

				Yeah, I find getting up to be a mind-game, myself. I&#039;ll tell myself before I go to bed that I WILL get up earlier than I have been, but then when the time comes I&#039;m totally convinced that I need to sleep more and I&#039;m really tired and I have nothing to do anyway until I go to work (which isn&#039;t true - there&#039;s plenty I could do before work that I can&#039;t do after work because of the night shift thing). It&#039;s something you just have to make yourself do, and don&#039;t be tricked by your brain making you feel like you need more sleep, because you probably don&#039;t and you&#039;ll realize that once you get out of bed and start doing stuff. It might help to come up with something to do before work, maybe go to the gym or something, that you commit to doing every day.

				I&#039;m the anti-thesis of a morning person.&nbsp; I set the alarm over an hour before I need to get going in the morning and still keep hitting the snooze and find myself running late.&nbsp; I suspect some folks are just not morning people.&nbsp; I function well late at night, but morning always seems to be when I sleep best.&nbsp; I know in my case it&#039;s not that I don&#039;t like my job, I love my job and am usually very eager to get in and get to work.

				Sadly I have no choice but to get up when my alarm goes off (or at least within 10 minutes) because I have a Metro North train I have to catch at a specific time. I wish that I could sleep in and be more lazy like when I was at my last job when I wasn&#039;t tied to the train schedule.<br /><br />I&#039;ve noticed that I have a tendency to fall back to sleep more easily, and thus make it more difficult to force myself out of bed, when I go back to my &quot;go to sleep&quot; position. It is a position I&#039;ve always gone to sleep in virtually my whole life (and it makes me fall to sleep faster), and if I revert to that when I hit the snooze button it&#039;s torture in a few minutes when I really absolutely have to get up. If you have that sort of position, maybe try to lie there in a position that makes it easier for you to stay awake.<br /><br />I have to say as well that it seems like you should probably find a more enjoyable job or find a way to tolerate your job more. I have a decent job, too - good pay, most of my coworkers are very nice and easy to get along with, good benefits - but I would much rather be at home. Mondays are nearly always frustrating to me because I&#039;ve spent the last two days staying exactly where I&#039;d rather be which is at home and with my husband (and my cat - can&#039;t forget about him). Of course, my objectives in life require me to be in the situation I am, otherwise I would most certainly be in a different occupation (likely lower paying, part time, and less stressful).<br /><br />Anyway, I wish you luck. You should probably also try to get to bed earlier. Maybe 9:30ish. That could help you too.

				OMG<br />I am so happy I found this thread. OK it&#039;s 1am and I&#039;ve already posted in two previous threads that I need to wake up in 6 hours, yet here I am! I have this same problem, although I have all of you people beat with the alarms. I have my cell phone alarm (REALLY obnoxious) right next to my face, a clock radio on the night stand, another clock radio on the dresser next to the night stand (about three steps from bed) a buzzer alarm clock on the opposite wall from the bed, another buzzer directly across the room from the clock radio on the dresser, AND my TV goes off to NY1 blaring. and yes I still wake up late everyday. I hated my job, and I was going in over an hour late every single day. At first my boss made me take vacation cuz she was working me 50odd hours a week (6 days) and I hadn&#039;t taken any vacation in over a year, but it didn&#039;t help. The second time I got talked to my &#039;supervisor&#039; was so shocked at the number of missed calls on my cell phone from my boyfriend (for a while he called me repeatedly every day until I got out of bed, it worked until I learned to fake him into thinking I was awake) he realized he was in over his head and suggested I get professional help. I figured it was my job. So I quit and got a new one. And that actually did help. For like a month. And now I&#039;m back to the same old issue. But now I&#039;m working a $8 10 minute cab ride from home. So when I get out of bed at 810 when I have to be at work at 830 (even though my alarms are staggered from 630am-800am) its not that big a deal. I don&#039;t eat late, I can&#039;t sleep before 1am, and on weekends, even if I magically woke up at 7am on friday, I&#039;m up until 4am on Saturday!!!! and no, I&#039;m not out partying, I&#039;m home online, or watching tv, or reading! ALONE! and then I sleep until sunset on Saturday. I&#039;ve figured by now that I&#039;m just incurable. No I have not seen any shrink or sleep study, as I mentioned I started a new job and I can&#039;t have insurance yet, and either way I can&#039;t take time off yet. And I&#039;m not comfy participating in a &#039;study&#039; I don&#039;t wanna be a guinea pig. But I will read some of the suggested material, and I have posted the link to &#039;clocky&#039; in my away message instructing anyone and everyone who reads it to buy it for me. Cuz I can&#039;t spend $50 on an alarm clock. at least not until I get my tax refund check ...... *contemplates*
