				So, what are people doing this year?&nbsp; I&#39;m here in Astoria this time around, making a few things to eat that day, maybe watch the Macy&#39;s parade and a few DVDs, and basically doing not much more than that.&nbsp; Nice time to simply relax and eat tasty food.

				Some Manhattan foodie friends of mine (even crazier foodies than me) are hosting about 15 friends and relatives for turducken and all the trimmings. (I&#39;m contributing a caesar salad (http://harrissmithrecipes.xwiki.com/xwiki/bin/view/Main/JudesCaesarSalad).) I&#39;ll be sure to take pictures of the turducken and have a report for y&#39;all on Friday!

				I&#39;ve been tossing around the idea of a Leftovers Party. You know-- informal and silly, perhaps a good way to see friends who are local and also trade some of those 5 metric tons of mashed potatoes you have for a bit someone else&#39;s prized pie leftovers or something...

				Rye with someone else&#39;s family. I met them when I was living overseas and they&#39;ve been kind enough to invite me and some other Tokyo people over for last Thanksgiving and this one. God, I love travellers.

				A half dozen (building) neighbors and I have organized an Orphans Traditional Thanksgiving Potluck (OTTP) dinner. So far we have shrimp cocktails, a cheese and cracker platter, crudit√©s, marinated tomatoes, onions and mozzarella, matzoh ball soup, a roasted turkey, sausage and cornbread stuffing, turnips, a candied sweet potato casserole, a classic string bean and French fried onion casserole, garlic mashed potatoes, brown sugar and ginger baby carrots, Brussels sprouts, cranberry-orange compote, 1 pumpkin pie, 1 apple pie, 1 chocolate cream pie, 4 dogs, 2 cats, 2 cockatiels, 1 parakeet and, probably, a couple additional people, 2 more dogs and maybe even a partridge in a pear tree.<br /><br />It&#39;s gonna be a lot of fun cooking and preparing in a communal kitchen with a group of nice people. Unfortunately there won&#39;t be any children running around this year.

				I <em>will</em> be working at the Freeze Peach 4-8 for those stragglers, bored folks, and people that have been kicked out of the kitchen until dinnertime.<br /><br />Hot chocolate, loud music, and things will be served up on request.<br /><br />The cafe will be open normal hours (noon-midnight) for those operating on a different schedule (ie, not 4-8).<br /><br />Come say hi.<br /><br />cheers,<br />jayme<br /><br />

				Huh, I didn&#39;t know there was such a thing as a traditional presidential pardon.&nbsp; That&#39;s nice.<br /><br />I&#39;m not eating turkey, but chicken.&nbsp; Bought it at International Meats, which is fabulous.&nbsp; In that one transaction, in a busy customer-packed store the day before Thanksgiving, I felt paid attention to and taken care of well.&nbsp; Fabulous!&nbsp; I&#39;ll be back for sure.<br /><br />Oh yeah, they have plenty of D&#39;Artagnan products (someone was asking in another thread).&nbsp; Yummy looking sausages, too.

				30th Ave next to (or a door down from) Marino Fish, so between 36th and 37th Streets.<br /><br />That block totally rules.&nbsp; Marino Fish, International Meats, Tony &amp; Daves, and Sai Organics, plus Sabor Tropical!&nbsp; :D

				Somewhat unrelated, but I just wanted to wish all you fine Astoria folks a very Happy Thanksgiving!&nbsp; Eat lots of turkey, or tofurkey, or turducken, or whatever, and enjoy your families and friends.&nbsp; You&#39;ve all made my time in New York very happy and I can&#39;t thank you enough for it!&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)

				Not sure what my mom (who&#39;s coming into town tonight) and I will do - I may just whip up something since I have a fridge to clear out ... or we&#39;ll see if Michael&#39;s or S&#39;agapo aren&#39;t filled to the brim.<br /><br />GFB, hope your cheescake survives the travel<br />JD, enjoy your time with your dad<br />NYCMacuser, dinner with friends?<br /><br />anyways, Happy Thanksgiving Astorians!
