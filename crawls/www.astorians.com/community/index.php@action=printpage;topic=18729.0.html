				Just found out I am preggers. Crazy!<br /><br />I cannot go back to my old gyn as she no longer takes my insurance. It was Dr. Renuka Paka which I have read mixed things about anyways. I am looking for a good midwife (preferable to a gyn, although I will take either at this point) in Manhattan. <br /><br />I have Aetna insurance.<br /><br />Any help much appreciated!

				My gyn is also an OB and takes Aetna. He&#039;s in Manhattan at 240 East 33rd, between 2nd &amp; 3rd Avenues.<br />He&#039;s with NYU. <br /><br />Andrew Scheinfeld<br />212-683-0600<br /><br />I&#039;ve been his patient for about 2 years now. Never been preggers, but he&#039;s a very good doctor. <br />And his staff is super nice and helpful.

				Congratulations!!!!<br /><br />I had a baby in December and wanted initially to switch to a midwife. In the end I stuck with my OB/GYN, Dr. Jeffrey Mazlin, simply because I felt such a good rapport with him and just really didn&#039;t want to leave his practice.<br /><br />I had a great birth at Lenox Hill (with his partner, in the end) -- they supported my desire to have few interventions, so I didn&#039;t have an induction, epidural, IV, etc. I did have to be pretty emphatic about these things ahead of time both with them and with the staff.<br /><br />If your search for a midwife comes up dry (and I know it&#039;s much harder to connect with midwives now that St. Vincent&#039;s has closed, sadly), I would give my unequivocal recommendation for him:<br /><br />Dr. Jeffrey Mazlin / Dr. Howard Shaw<br />212.517.9048<br /><br />His office is at the corner of 67th and Park, so it&#039;s also really easy to get to from Astoria, even when you&#039;re 9 months pregnant ;) Oh, and he definitely takes Aetna.

				Congratulations!<br /><br />My midwives were fantastic, Barbara Sellars and Elizabeth Boyce<br />http://www.nycmidwives.com/<br /><br />I don&#039;t think they take insurance, but my insurance paid the claim out-of-network and it was all covered.&nbsp; <br /><br />I used them for both of my kids, and it was a really good experience. <br /><br />Rachel

				I am so happy to hear that there are now midwives practicing at Lenox Hill! I will keep your recommendation in mind, MomMT, when I&#039;m in the market for a midwife/ob again ;)<br /><br />I had a great experience at Lenox Hill, even though I had a lot of anxiety about being in a hospital. The nurses were wonderful (both delivery and postpartum), they have a great lactation consultant, and the classes they offer every day were extremely helpful.
