				Is anyone following the three statewide Democratic primaries this year, or the Republican US Senate Primary?&nbsp; Our Attorney General, Eliot Spitzer, is facing off against Nassau County Executive, in the Democratic Primary for Governor.&nbsp; We have a four way fight for the Democratic nomination for Attorney General with former HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo, former Public Advocate Mark Green, former Clinton Administration staffer Sean Patrick Maloney and Charlie King all seeking the nod.&nbsp; Senator Hillary Clinton is facing a challenge from Jonathan Tasini, predominately on the basis of her position on the situation in Iraq.&nbsp; The Republicans get to chose between former Yonkers Mayor John Spencer and former Reagan Administration staffer KT McFarland.<br />Is anyone following the races and up for discussing them?&nbsp; They&#39;re all pretty interesting and will have real impacts on our state.

				yes, I would love to start a discussion.&nbsp; I had been following the elections prior to our power outage.&nbsp; It appears that Eliot Spitzer is the favorite.&nbsp; I would love to hear more about the issues that the politicians stand for.&nbsp; Yes, I was dismayed that Hillary Clinton voted for the war, with the understanding that there were &quot;the weapons of mass distruction.&quot;&nbsp; However, within the past month or so, there was a vote before I believe the Senate, which said that that the U.S. would pull out within a year, which she did not vote for.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have always been very impressed with Mark Green.&nbsp; His speeches make sense and he appears to be passionate about what he believes in.<br /><br />I love politics, but it is so hard for me to follow the news.&nbsp; I start reading the news and I get down.&nbsp; Especially with the war between Lebanon or the Hezbollah and Israel.&nbsp; So, I forced myself to read to at least find out how and why it got started.&nbsp;

				Eliot is the definite favorite.&nbsp; As a disclosure, I&#39;m actively supporting him, though I don&#39;t work for his campaign.&nbsp; I think he&#39;s one of the smartest people (and most impressive) I&#39;ve met in a long time.&nbsp; He is fearless and goes after wrong-doers, which I found very inspiring.&nbsp; He&#39;s also in favor of gay marriage, which is a big deal for me.<br />I&#39;ve been following Hillary&#39;s evolving position on the war and it&#39;s been interesting.&nbsp; I still don&#39;t know exactly where she stands - it&#39;s blurry.&nbsp; I&#39;m not sure that Tasini is the right person to pull her over to opposing the war more vigorously, but maybe he&#39;s having an effect. <br />I like all of the AG candidates.&nbsp; Mark is very articulate and a good person.&nbsp; He was a very good Public Advocate and I think he would have been an outstanding Mayor.&nbsp; Andrew learned a lot from his last race (for Governor) and I think he was one of the better Secretaries in the Clinton Administration (and probably the best HUD secretary ever).&nbsp; Sean Patrick Maloney is probably the best on the stump, but I don&#39;t know if he can get well known enough to win.&nbsp; He certainly has energy and a dedicated following, but he&#39;s in single digits in the early polls.&nbsp; Charlie King is a nice man.&nbsp; I don&#39;t understand why he is in the race.

				Tasini came out saying Hilary Clinton is &quot;personally&quot; responsible for all the deaths in Iraq.&nbsp; While I&#39;m not really a fan of her position and voting on the war, and by approving funding for it there is a level of responsibility there, but I found that statement to be over the top, and out of control (OOC) and really put me off to him.&nbsp; <br /><br />Suozzi intrigues me with his turn around of Nassau County.<br /><br />Gubernatorial Debates tomorrow (Tuesday) 7/25 at 7pm on NY1.

				Did anyone watch the debate?&nbsp; <br /><br />Well, I did.&nbsp; One issue that mattered to me, via NY1:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The two also weighed in on the power outage in Queens, and whether they agreed with Mayor Michael Bloomberg&#39;s praise of Con Edison CEO Kevin Burke.<br /><br />&quot;Absolutely not. I was stunned that he said it. I was stunned that he said it,” said Spitzer. “Now, I think we need to dig very deeply and develop the record, figure out where the breakdowns were and make sure people are held accountable.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I am in no position whatsoever to second guess Mayor Bloomberg - who is on the ground, who is dealing with the people at Con Ed to find out what&#39;s going on - because I trust his judgment as a chief executive,&quot; countered Suozzi. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				straight off the bat... i&#39;m a spitzer girl... anyway i was happy with the response to the question, &quot;Do you intend to run for President?&#39; Suozzi said yes, Spitzer said no. I understand that people aiming for the White House must get there thur a series of steps up, but for now I&#39;m all about the mayor who doesn&#39;t want to be governor, and the soon-to-be governor who doesn&#39;t want to be president. keeps them more focused on the task at hand, new york.

				I caught a good chunk of the debate and remain a strong Spitzer supporter.&nbsp; His answer on ConEd and Gay Marriage would have sealed the deal, but I think he was better on every single issue.&nbsp; Suozzi is a smart man, but I don&#39;t care for a lot of his positions and I think he&#39;s trying to position himself to the right of Spitzer on most every issue.

				(I would be curious what are the financial requirements in other &quot;democracies&quot;)<br /><br />***<br />(1)&nbsp; NY1 bars Tasini from US Senate Debate, claiming he has not raised enough money<br /><br /><br />As you may have heard, New York 1 Cable News, &quot;NY1&quot; has refused to schedule a debate between Hillary Clinton and Jonathan Tasini.&nbsp; They claim the reason is financial.&nbsp; Tasini has collected 40,000 signatures and will be on the ballot. He is tracking in the polls at 13%.&nbsp; In the past, NY1&#39;s threshold for a debate has been that the candidate had to be polling at at least 5%. Now, it seems that they are changing the rules and adding the proviso that the candidate must have also raised $500,000.&nbsp; This is outrageous and calls for action.<br /><br />The Tasini campaign held a press conference about this yesterday.&nbsp; The following is an excerpt from a letter sent by the Tasini campaign today: <br /><br />&nbsp;<br />We are asking you to immediately call Robert Hardt, NY1&#39;s Director of Politics, who was one of a few media power-brokers who made this decision that is closing off discussion and censoring debate. We are calling for a simple criteria for participation: any candidate who has qualified for the ballot should be allowed into the debate. Call or e-mail him TODAY: 212-379-3330 or Robert.Hardt@ny1news.com and demand that NY1 revise its criteria. <br /><br />Democracy for NYC believes in fair participation and accountability in our political system, and we urge our members to contact NY1 today. <br /><br />http://www.dfnyc.org/cms/<br /><br /><br />

				TRX - I understand why Tasini wants to be included, but I doubt he gets included (he&#39;s lucky to have qualified for the ballot).&nbsp; If he was a credible candidate and had a chance of pulling an upset or having a strong showing, I think he would have been able to have had more debates.&nbsp; I was impressed that Suozzi was included and a debate was held, considering how poorly he&#39;s polling (and after spending all that money!).&nbsp; <br />I think that regardless of who the Democrats nominate, they will beat Pirro and all Statewide offices will be held by the Democrats, though I fear the State Senate may stay in Republican hands.

				McD,<br /><br />I understand that incumbents are often in a position to avoid debates.<br />But to do so to me seems to cheapen the election process.<br /><br />Spitzer did not have to debate Suozzi but did the correct thing.<br />If in only the slightest, voters have a better understanding of the candidates and it can add meaning to their selection as Party representatives.<br /><br />What are the chances that Hillary would lose this year?<br />Does that mean she should not debate at all?<br />In what way are her challengers credible?<br /><br />I think Tasini has important questions for the incumbent and thousands of voters in NY would like to see such a debate.<br /><br />Is there any room for idealism in our process of politics or is that like trying to mix oil and mud?<br />http://opendebates.org/<br /><br />If the State Senate and all the major offices would be held by Democrats, what improvements might you expect to see?<br />Do you think Democrats will spend and tax even more than Pataki; Silver; Bruno have?<br />And if they do so, would they still reduce debt?<br /><br />Cheers, back in a few.<br />(After the CT primaries)<br /><br />Given these years, I would love to see the Senate and Assembly change hands. Or at least have Representatives that could select a more consultative Speaker.

				Debates are always a good thing, I just think the process works against them in some cases.&nbsp; Candidates who have no chance of winning usually can&#39;t get candidates (especially incumbents) to appear with them - and the rules for televised debates seem to vary from election to election.&nbsp; I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s right, just that we have to be realists.&nbsp; The League of Women Voters and some of the other good government groups usually try to put debates together, but usually they want candidates to demonstrate viability, and I am not personally convinced that they would view Tasini as a credible candidate.&nbsp; A debate between Clinton and Tasini could be interesting, but aside from Iraq, I haven&#39;t seen him raise many issues.<br />If the Democrats take the State Senate, I think that Governor Spitzer could push through a reform agenda and make some progress instead of having the usual gridlock that has paralyzed the state for years.
