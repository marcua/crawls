			<br /><br /><br />On Sunday, 10/28 at 6:30pm, I&#039;m hosting a storytelling home concert in Jackson Heights, Queens and hope you&#039;ll come. If you&#039;ve never been to a storytelling home concert, I invite 4 master storytellers into my cozy living room and invite neighbors to listen to them tell true stories from their personal lives. We have a sofa, chairs, meditation cushions, and pillows and some beverages and refreshments. I created this event so that neighbors could meet. As you plan your weekend and are thinking about ways to keep warm, this will be a friendly and toasty evening. I&#039;m asking for $15 donations to pay the performers but it&#039;s just a suggestion. Please let me know if you plan on coming since seating is limited.&nbsp; Email me at heightshub@gmail.com for reservations and our address.<br /><br />Also, thanks for any help you can provide spreading the word.<br /><br />Nancy <br /><br /><br /><br />
