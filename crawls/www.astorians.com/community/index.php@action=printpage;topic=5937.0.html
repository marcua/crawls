				I guess it depends on location, but I would start by reading the thread that I attached below.<br /><br />http://www.astorians.com/index.php?topic=5069.0<br /><br />If you click on search right under the banner, you can enter the key word diner and read other threads (there are at least three pages re diners!)<br /><br />Good luck!

I went to Uno&#039;s when a young 21 yr oldwho had no cultural ideals. Now i wouldn&#039;t eat there if it was the last eatery on earth. Besides which, haven&#039;t you ever heard of the Jackson Hole Diner??

				Even though Pizza is supposed to be their specialty, I will say that I dislike their pizza very much.&nbsp; Everything else is pretty good.

				Uno&#039;s is what it is.&nbsp; The drinks are ok, and some of the food is tasty.&nbsp; It wouldn&#039;t be my first choice, but it&#039;s better than some places and it&#039;s not a bad place if you have a group and just want a decent night out, especially if you&#039;re going to the movies.
