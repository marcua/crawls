				this is a great idea, bookbinder. i cannot wait for the first tour (hopefully you can get something together before it gets cold.)<br /><br /><br /><br />on a related tangent - there is a rad bikelane that runs on 34th, or 35th st., i think, all the way down to 36th ave near the Kaufmann Astoria studios... its an actual marked lane on the road - ive ridden it several times and it actually stays clear of parked cars!<br /><br /><br /><br />cheers for the great idea bookbinder - and good luck putting it together<br /><br /><br /><br />ff

				Awwww! &nbsp;That's thoughtful.<br /><br />I just got back from my &quot;tour of the Southwest&quot; - a trip to Los Angeles and Las Vegas. &nbsp;I used to live in L.A. and hadn't been back for awhile. &nbsp;I hung out with my dear friends, and also went to a reunion party of these other friends I used to hang with 8-15 years ago and we had all lost touch. &nbsp;It was amazing!!! &nbsp;It was like no time had passed at all. &nbsp;So much love.<br /><br />If you hardy souls are biking this week, I'll be there!<br /><br />Here's a pic of me at the show I went to on Friday (in L.A.).<br /><br />http://snipurl.com/a3ra<br /><br />I'm on the left, just above the white shirted dude.
