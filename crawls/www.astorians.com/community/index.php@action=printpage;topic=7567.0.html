				So, one of my roommates shared with me a very, very true (and disgusting) story about her experience the other night with Chinese food from Sun-Wah (corner of 36th Avenue and 31st Street) and I thought I&#039;d share this story with my fellow Astorians just in case you ever decide to eat from this place...<br /><br />She ordered her usual - steamed broccoli and brown rice. As she was eating it, something told her look down.... lo and behold, she saw big, green, caterpillar looking worms in her broccoli!!!! <br /><br />This totally repulsed me!! Isn&#039;t there something that you can do?? Isn&#039;t there someone that you can complain to?? I feel like she let this go way too easily and I can use any 411 to take this a step higher. This is unhealthy, gross, unsanitary and plain and simple - DISGUSTING!!!!!!<br /><br />&nbsp;:yuck:

				Your roommate should definitely have reported this. &nbsp;But, isn&#039;t it a bit extreme to say that you&#039;ll never eat Chinese food anywhere? &nbsp;For all the negative comments you&#039;ve made regarding Chinese restaurants, have you ever tried eating at a real Chinese restaurant, not a fast food place? &nbsp;If you head out to Flushing or Manhattan, you&#039;d be surprised at the world of difference between the local fast food places which are probably staffed by non-professional cooks and more formal and authentic Chinese dining.<br /><br />You get what you pay for (literally), I think.

				I&#039;ve had one too many bad experiences with Chinese food. I can only speak for myself, no one else. If I don&#039;t ever want to eat it again, so be it. I&#039;m only sending out a warning for anyone who orders from that place. That&#039;s all.

				I should say that I don&#039;t do take out Chinese for health reasons (I&#039;m talking about salt, calories, fat, etc).&nbsp; I&#039;m honestly not sure about restaurant Chinese food, but at the very least it has to be more sanitary.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure there are wonderful Chinese restaurants all around, I&#039;ve eaten at some in the past.&nbsp; Either way, I&#039;m trying to stay away from certain things in my diet, no offense to Chinese, Mexican, Spanish, or any other type of food.&nbsp; Moderation is key too.

				As a kid, my parents steamed some frozen broccoli, and my portion had a caterpillar! I didn&#039;t eat frozen broccoli for years after that. Bleah. :yuck: This said, the caterpillars that eat broccoli are well camouflaged, make it through processing fairly often, and are very hard to see if you&#039;re prepping enough for a restaurant. Any restaurant could have overlooked one. <br /><br />Anyway, isn&#039;t it reassuring that the growers aren&#039;t saturating your food with enough pesticides to kill <strong>all</strong> the bugs? I&#039;d be a lot more upset about finding a roach in my food. Roaches come from the dirty basements of restaurants, and carry disease. Caterpillars come from nature, and won&#039;t hurt you at all if you eat one. (Except perhaps mentally! :) )

				All of those fast-food Chinese places disturb me.&nbsp; But what disturbs me far more is that people think Pat&#039;s, Geno&#039;s or Jim&#039;s makes a good cheesesteak.<br /><br />Please, if you&#039;re in Philly and you want a decent steak, go to Tony Luke&#039;s or Tony Jr.&#039;s.&nbsp; Or at least, if you&#039;re hungry on South Street, breathe in the admittedly alluring aroma of Jim&#039;s then promptly cross the street and get your steak at Ishkabibble&#039;s.<br /><br />Jeez.<br /><br />I count myself lucky that I grew up where there were real* Chinese restaurants, not these NYC fast-food places.&nbsp; Otherwise I would probably be afraid of Chinese food.<br /><br />*real as in real restaurants, not real as in real Chinese cuisine.

				Finding a caterpillar in my food in my plate would freak me out, but I wouldn&#039;t swear off the food for the next four to five decades.&nbsp; That&#039;s like me not going to the movies ever again because I got railroaded into going to see Runaway Bride (shudder!)&nbsp; It is an extremely rare restaurant that does not have little critters and loads of bacteria.&nbsp; Go look at the hands of the guy who puts together your salad.&nbsp; That&#039;s alot worse then any caterpillar.<br /><br />But the difference between chinese food for americans and chinese food for chinese is immense.&nbsp; As different as Irish and French cuisines, no kidding.&nbsp; So if you&#039;re thinking of giving the &quot;cuisine&quot; another go, go on over to Flushing.&nbsp; There is a pretty clean place called Sweet-n-Tart Cafe, on 38th Avenue just off of Main Street.&nbsp; The entire kitchen is exposed and can be seen by all the customers from the dining area.&nbsp; Its not the best real chinese out there (because the best is from the dirty little hole in the walls where most americans wouldnt want to eat at) but is good stuff.&nbsp; Alot healthier than american chinese food.&nbsp; Their congee is excellent, noodles so-so.

				Well, I for one shall not stray from my bi-monthly indulgence of greasy chopstick at my favorite take out, Wing Lok, on 30th Ave near 27th St. I <em>will</em>, however, closely inspect my broccoli to make sure I pick out any critters before munching. Funny, I was in Thailand last year and I would have had to pay extra for the caterpillars!

				Doubtful of maggots -- maggots generally eat rotting things not live, healthy veggies.&nbsp; Caterpillars are much more common.<br /><br />Vegetables, particularly fresh organic ones, often come with a friend or two.&nbsp; It&#039;s a good reminder to wash.&nbsp; I like to add a bit of salt to lukewarm water and agitate if I&#039;m uncertain.&nbsp; The added grit will help to remove any extra dirt (or extra).<br />

				But it wouldn&#039;t have much to do with the style of the cuisine, would it?&nbsp; Whether the Hunan Whatever down the street is authentically Chinese is an entirely different question than whether maggots get in the veggies.

				One of my recent CSA apples had a worm in it.&nbsp; I&#039;m not swearing off apples or CSA food.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you&#039;re not eating Chinese food ANYWHERE you have issues beyond critters in your food and probably don&#039;t really like Chinese food anyway.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m reminded of one of my students who when I suggested we go out for Chinese the other day insisted that all Chinese places serve rats and she&#039;d &quot;Never go to another Chinese place again!&quot;&nbsp; My student it 14 years old. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				This happened to me but all I did was change Chinese take-out places:<br /><br />I&#039;m waiting to pick up my order and a women comes back into the joint complaining there was a bug in her food (she had walked out with it and started eating it somewhere else I guess).<br /><br />The women behind the counter gives her the money for that meal back...<br /><br />I see all this, but I figure stuff happens...<br /><br />Then the guy sitting down in the place eating his meal, gets up and shows them a bug in his food too! This is all within like 5 minutes.<br /><br />He gets his money back too, I apologize and leave but not before the lady behind the counter says something in Chinese with a really distraught look on her face that made me sad. (It was an order for 6 with hardly any combination plates, i feel its all rice)<br /><br />My friends were thoroughly upset it took two bug incidents for me to finally decide to stop waiting for our food but this place was just so good all the time that I was willing to let one bug incident go. I draw the line at two and maybe NtrainGrl24, you should too.

				This rivals the live roach that was crawling in my friend&#039;s order of chile at Panchitos Mexican Restaurant in Greenwich Village. There were six of us in agroup, and we were already well into eating our meals when the little critter made his appearance. Needless to say we were all grossed out. My friend made a scene, and we all collected ourselves and left without paying and went to an Italian place instead. Two other tables that had just been seated also got up and left without ordering. I haven&#039;t been back there since.

				I&#039;ve worked in several restaurants in different cities and they ALL had roach problems... Sadly, it&#039;s pretty much inevitable that any restaurant you eat at does have them crawling around in the back.&nbsp; You can disagree based on hopes of cleaner establishments or maybe you yourself worked somewhere that seemed free of the critters, but I&#039;ve seen them everytime. They&#039;re impossible to get rid of forever, they always come back eventually.&nbsp; And what&#039;s worse is you can be so on top of cleanliness and keeping things refridgerated and having the exterminator come once every two weeks, they STILL come.&nbsp; There&#039;s a reason they&#039;ve been around since before the dinosaurs...&nbsp; :yuck:<br /><br />When I worked at Bertucci&#039;s in Boston, they were LIVING in the soda machine. They loved the sugary syrup.... barf.

				you will NOT find a restaurant (fast food or not) anywhere in the world where there isn&#039;t something going on.<br /><br />if you see a regular problem then that is one thing, but if the food is tasty to you (or everything else is right), don&#039;t judge a place on a single incident.&nbsp; these things happen.<br /><br />

				A live roach crawling out of my food would be pretty hard to get over, even if I liked the food.&nbsp; My appetite would be over, and I&#039;d never be able to look at the food or taste&nbsp; it without getting nausea.&nbsp; Caterpillars may be a natural occurrence in greenery and I&#039;ll give you that one, but roaches crawling in my food?&nbsp; Alive?&nbsp; That would turn my stomach forever.

				I found a piece of what looked like human scalp with hair attached in my food from a Chinese restaurant in Newark (I think it was the <em>only</em> restaurant that delivered at night in downtown Newark when I worked there in the &#039;90s - the Ironbound was too far).&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t rat hide.&nbsp; I sure never ordered from that Chinese restaurant again, but it didn&#039;t stop me from eating food from other Chinese restaurants.

				daisy, i think if you&#039;re finding LIVE roaches (or any living thing) crawling out of your food, it&#039;s a good bet that they didn&#039;t come from the restaurant itself.&nbsp; wouldn&#039;t they be dead if they were cooked in the food, or trapped somehow in the packaging when the hot food was being poured into the container?<br /><br />yes, bugs definitely happen in restaurants, and that certainly doesn&#039;t excuse them, but c&#039;mon, let&#039;s be fair?!<br /><br />i think the worst restaurant faux paux i&#039;ve EVER seen was in a thai restaurant in the village.&nbsp; my friend pulled a used bandaid out of her pad thai.&nbsp; now that is pretty freakin&#039; gross!

				I have a pretty strong stomach and I&#039;m very forgiving of occasional bugs on greens (hey, it&#039;s natural) but if I saw a live roach on something I was eating, I think that would put me over the edge, regardless of how it got there.&nbsp; (Or at least give me $50K to happily eat it, a la Fear Factor.)

				never said it wasn&#039;t gross, or that a roach (or any bug, for that matter) in my food wasn&#039;t a deal-breaker on the meal in front of me.<br /><br />sure, if you&#039;re sitting in the restaurant and a live bug comes crawling out of it, then yeah of course it came from the restaurant.&nbsp; but i have never seen a LIVE bug crawl out of a HOT take-out food container (dead ones maybe, and that&#039;s just as gross).<br /><br />i guess all i am saying is that this stuff can happen ANYWHERE regardless of the restaurant.&nbsp; it doesn&#039;t have to be a take-out place.&nbsp; dirty, nasty stuff (in all varieties: bugs, dirty hands, rotten food, any foreign matter) also happens in the very best of restaurants too...don&#039;t kid yourself otherwise.<br /><br /><br />
