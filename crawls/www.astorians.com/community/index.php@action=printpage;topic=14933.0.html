				The Thrilllist piece mentions a Thursday opening, but a friend of mine was speaking to an Astoria bar owner this weekend, who had heard tomorrow as the opening date---either way, it sounds like it will be open by the weekend...maybe they&#039;re planning a soft weeknight opening based on the weather?

				I went tonight and it is an *amazing* place!&nbsp; Really really great.&nbsp; <br /><br />An almost equal amount of indoor and outdoor space, so when it&#039;s cold or rainy, this is still going to be a &#039;go to&#039; destination.&nbsp; Not just a seasonal, sunny day, thing.<br /><br />I liked their beer selection and their angus burgers are perfect.<br /><br />Forget the Astoria Beer Garden, this is the place to be for Astorians if you don&#039;t like lines and massive crowds.

				I think a 1/2 liter was 7 or 8 bucks...a liter was $13.&nbsp; Tons of beer choices...at least 20, I think.&nbsp; Same prices for whatever kind you like.<br /><br />I had an angus burger...$8.&nbsp; 2 hot dogs were the same, 8 bucks.&nbsp; Didn&#039;t notice the other things on the food menu, I was set on my burger.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; Awesome rolls too...potato rolls I think.<br /><br />Such a great addition to LIC/Astoria!!!

				I&#039;m really excited to check this place out.&nbsp; It looks and sounds real nice so far.&nbsp; The Bohemian Hall Beer Garden has lost it&#039;s magic to me.&nbsp; But I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll continue to thrive.&nbsp; I hope this place does well.&nbsp; Thanks for the review, Kyle.

				I&#039;m so glad that there&#039;s a thread about this.&nbsp; I was just talkign to my better half about how it&#039;s opening soon, and we&#039;re both excited to have a less crowded outdoor space for drinking, dominoes and hangout sessions.&nbsp; <br />Two questions: How is the size compared to the bohemian hall, and do they serve pitchers?&nbsp; Other than those questions, I am hoping to make it over there this weekend.&nbsp; So excited.

				They do serve pitchers...I forget the price.&nbsp; And 1/2 liters and liters.&nbsp; Liters were $13 and they serve them in those huge, thick glass mugs like at the Williamsburg beer garden.<br /><br />I&#039;d say it is about the same size outdoors wise and about 4x bigger indoors as the Astoria garden.&nbsp; Amazing space, really, you guys have to check this place out!&nbsp; Words and pictures don&#039;t do this place justice!&nbsp; They have an outdoor fire pit/fireplace-type thing going on too.&nbsp; It sounds corny but the place has good feng shui, very well laid out and it makes you want to explore and walk around.<br /><br />This is so huge for Queens!

				nice positive review here too from the Q-note<br /><br />The Other Beer Garden<br /><br />Good Brews Poured at LIC&#039;s New Studio Square<br />May 14, 2009<br />QUAFF &amp; CONSUME<br /><br />Nothing beats a swig of beer in the great outdoors at Studio Square<br /><br /><br />Those familiar with the sprawling terrace and waterfall-laden garden at Astoria’s Mediterranean lounge and restaurant, Cavo, might not be surprised by owner Steve Tallides’ newest project, 50,000 square foot beer garden and event space, Studio Square.&nbsp; Opening today in Long Island City, down the street from Kaufman Astoria Studios and a few subway stops from the all-day ruckus over at beloved Bohemian Hall &amp; Beer Garden, Studio Square manages to give the low-key pastime of beer sipping an edge of sophistication.&nbsp; “We wanted to create something urban but with an old-world feel,” says Tallides, &quot;and a chill atmosphere for people to let loose.” <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Along with partners Tommy Demaras, Larry Cerullo and Taso Pavlou, Tallides has transformed a multi-level factory building (the airy digs upstairs are devoted to private soirees) into a modern space heavy on industrial charm. Inside, floors are polished concrete, bars are topped with exotic African Wenge wood and vintage-inspired murals are a nod to nostalgic &quot;Blackwell&quot; and &quot;Pomeroy&quot;, the names 36th and 37th Streets were once called.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Like any true biergarten, the real joy lies in enjoying a few cold ones out in the balmy open air.&nbsp; Sitting down below in the cobblestone courtyard at one of the communal tables made by hand (thanks to a Bob Vila-like Tallides and team), surrounded by bourbon barrels, River Birch trees and a seductive fire pit that blows away camp memories is magical. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Over 20 different beers hold court at Studio Square, from Belgian Hoegaarden Original White Ale to the goods from Westchester’s only microbrewery, Captain Lawrence Brewing Company.&nbsp; For summer palates craving something a little more tropical, luckily Studio Square has a soft spot for sangria.&nbsp; Like the beer, it&#039;s available on tap, pumped upstairs from high school chem-like vats in the basement.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Instead of the usual run-of-the-mill bar grub to soak up all the beer, look for Black Angus burgers, Greek sausage and pulled pork sandwiches, with meat from Astoria-based Schaller &amp; Weber. And, once you become a regular, no need to fret about packing on the extra pounds; as incentive, Tallides just so happens to also own Astoria’s popular gym, The Rock Health &amp; Fitness Club.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />www.studiosquarenyc.com, 35-33 36th Street, Long Island City, 718-383-1001; N,W to 36th Avenue and G,R,V to Steinway Street<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

				I swung by last night to peek in the windows and was delighted to find it open.&nbsp; My first impression was, &quot;this place gets it right!&quot; from the moment I stepped in.&nbsp; Not only are the front doors also garage doors that will be raised during the summer, but the space, staff, menu and beer selection have all been painstakingly well-thought out.&nbsp; They have an equal amount of domestic and European drafts. A half-liter is $7, a liter $13 and a pitcher $18.&nbsp; &nbsp;Off the top of my head I can recall Abita Light, Blue Moon &quot;Honeymoon Summer Ale,&quot; Sam Adams: Cherry Wheat and Pale Ale, Stone Ruination IPA, Dogfish 60-second IPA, Capt. Lawrence Freshchester, Radeberger, Hoegaarden, Pilsner-Urquell, and a few more European ones. I am a craft beer-drinker so I was paying attention to those more than anything. <br />This beer garden is HUGE! You could drive a 1972 Cadillac through it, although I wouldn&#039;t recommend that.&nbsp; There are Two bars indoors and two or three outside.&nbsp; What I thought was genius is the long and wide metal awning-covered area that surrounds the picnic tabled garden outside.&nbsp; You could sit there during a downpour, not get wet, and still be outside.&nbsp; The firepit is also cool.&nbsp; I would sell marshmallows and let people roast them there.&nbsp; I also really, really like the staff here.&nbsp; They are happy to let you taste new beers, are good at making recommendations, and know their stuff.&nbsp; When I say they get it right I mean you can go up to the counter to get your beer and food to take back to your table.&nbsp; When the old beer garden discontinued this policy, and went to table service, they lost a lot of the cachet that endeared it to their customers.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t order any food, just a giant pretzel for $3, but will definitely do so next time I visit.&nbsp; I like that everything is $8 and that they keep it simple.&nbsp; The interior looks like an old factory and gives the place a rustic charm.&nbsp; They told me that there are plans for live music.&nbsp; I can&#039;t wait to return when it is filled with people, rather than the 1:30am visit I paid to see it in its full splendor.&nbsp; So go, you won&#039;t be disappointed!

				From Gothamist.&nbsp; Click link for pics.<br /><br />http://gothamist.com/2009/05/14/studio_square_mother_of_all_beer_ga.php?gallery0Pic=6#gallery (http://gothamist.com/2009/05/14/studio_square_mother_of_all_beer_ga.php?gallery0Pic=6#gallery)<br /><br /><br /><br />Of course it&#039;s not literally the mother, for several obvious reasons—for one thing, there&#039;s the well-established predecessor Bohemian Hall, to the north in Astoria. But at least in terms of size, Studio Square in Long Island City is now king of New York, boasting a colossal 18,000 square feet beer garden that officially opens today at 4 p.m. The full beer and food menu is below.<br /><br />Unlike Radegast Hall in Williamsburg, another relatively recent beer garden which affects an old world attitude with waitresses dressed in dirndls, the ambiance at Studio Square hews contemporary. (Leave your lederhosen home.) Live music is promised, and the site also boasts a massive event space for weddings. The cobblestone courtyard is made from Belgium Blocks and dotted with River Birch trees; around the perimeter, a covered patio accommodates rainy day imbibing, and the indoor bar features vibrant murals by graffiti artist Louie “KR One” Gasparro.<br /><br />Studio Square&#039;s menu includes German Bratwurst, Certified Black Angus Hamburgers, Beef and Chicken Kababs, and Pulled Pork Sandwiches. There are over 15 imported, domestic, and craft beers on draft (see below), plus a range of wines and spirits and housemade Sangria. Coming as this does on the heels of Dutch Kills opening, it looks like all Long Island City needs now is a fancy absinthe bar!<br /><br />Studio Square // 35-33 36th Street (between 35th &amp; 36th Avenues), Long Island City, Queens // 718-383-1001 // Open Monday-Friday 4:00 p.m. - 4:00 a.m. and Saturday &amp; Sunday 12:00 p.m. - 4:00 a.m.<br /><br />BEER LIST <br /><br />Spaten Oktoberfest<br /><br />Sam Adams Lager<br /><br />Sam Adams Seasonal: Cherry Wheat<br /><br />Hoegaarden Original White Ale<br /><br />Carlsberg<br /><br />Franziskaner Hefe Weiss<br /><br />Stella Artois<br /><br />Pilsner Urquell<br /><br />Blue Moon: Honeymoon Summer Ale<br /><br />Captain Lawrence - Freshchester Pale Ale<br /><br />Stone Levitation Ale<br /><br />Stone Pale Ale<br /><br />Abita Light<br /><br />Hoffbrau Dunkel<br /><br />Radeberger<br /><br />Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA<br /><br />Weihenstephan Hefe-Weiss bier<br /><br />GRILL MENU<br /><br />Hamburger (8oz cert Black Angus) - $8 <br /><br />Cheese Burger (8oz cert Black Angus) - $8 <br /><br />Barbecued chicken breast sandwich - $8 <br /><br />Pulled pork sandwich - $8 <br /><br />Portobello mushroom “burger” - $8 <br /><br />2 Schaller &amp; Weber Hotdogs - $8 <br /><br />Bratwurst - $8<br /><br />Weisswurst - $8 <br /><br />Greek sausage - $8 <br /><br />Kielbasa - $8 <br /><br />Chicken souvlaki (2) - $8 <br /><br />Pork souvlaki (2) - $8 <br /><br />Jumbo pretzel - $3 <br /><br />Side of fries - $3<br /><br />Side of bacon - $3 <br /><br />Side of sauerkraut - $3<br />

				I know this is blasphemy in a thread like this, but I don&#039;t like beer. At all. Sorry, I&#039;ve given it tons of chances, just not my thing.<br /><br />But! I love drinking outside with people who like beer...who is pretty much everyone but me. And I&#039;m super excited to check this place out. Does anyone know if they have specialty cocktails, or is it standard bar stuff? And about what do they charge for a drink (say...rum &amp; coke, my standard). Just curious. I don&#039;t mind paying a little more for a drink as opposed to beer, as long as it isn&#039;t in one of those teeny cups filled to the brim with ice.

				I have a new favorite spot in Astoria!!!!&nbsp; Goodbye Beer Garden, hello Studio Square!!!&nbsp; Of course, I&#039;m sure this place will be overrun in a few weeks, but at least there are more choices in Astoria for good old outdoor fun.&nbsp; This place is huge.&nbsp; I love it, from the decor to the service, top notch.&nbsp; &nbsp;Yeah, it&#039;s a little pricier, but honestly, when you compare it to what you get at the other beer garden, this place is worth it.&nbsp; I don&#039;t drink beer but they do make Sangria, so we got two pitchers and I&#039;m very tipsy as I write this..... Woohoo!!! hahahha Sangria&#039;s 25 dollars a pitcher, very strong and lots of fruit, and beer pitchers are 18.&nbsp; All the food is 8 dollars I think.&nbsp; No table service but lines weren&#039;t long and they have plenty of friendly staff on hand.&nbsp; There&#039;s a big fire pit which is really cool but all these young lovers were getting all romantic over there.&nbsp; The indoors is nice too, but everyone was outside, it was crowded but there were still seats available and not nearly as crowded as the other beer garden.&nbsp; I&#039;m a big fan of Cavo and these guys definitely know how to run a successful business.&nbsp; There was a lot of thought that went into this space and it&#039;s just beautiful.&nbsp;

				I was there the other night and thought it was fabulous.&nbsp; They have done a really good job with the space, both inside and out.&nbsp; Love all the wood (they built those picnic tables up on the 5th floor of the building), the fire pit, all the indoor and courtyard space, the beer selection, the option of sangria.&nbsp; The number of tap areas is a plus, too.<br /><br />I love their french fries!&nbsp; And the sausages.&nbsp; I expect this will give the Bohemian beer garden some competition, which can only be a good thing; this place is closer to the city and Brooklyn on the N, which I am sure would be appealing to those coming into town (and those of us coming home from work in the city).&nbsp; I hope that Studio Square&#039;s success is enough to wake up the management at Bohemian so they understand that they are no longer the only game in town, and that is will encourage them to improve some the things that they do not do very well (like table service and how they get the food/drink to patrons).<br /><br />I am looking forward to spending some time there with my fellow Astorians this summer!

				So, my guy and I checked this place out on Saturday night. Actually, enigmacat and I tried to check it out on Friday night while we were out on a walk, but I didn&#039;t have my ID on me so they wouldn&#039;t let me in.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Anyway, we were only there for 45 minutes or so, as we came just to get a beer each and dinner, but it was quite a pleasant experience.&nbsp; As others have said, it&#039;s a very nice place.&nbsp; I love the layout, the decor, ambiance, etc. were all exactly what I hope for.&nbsp; We both got hamburgers and fries ($10 each) and damn, those are some tasty hamburgers.&nbsp; Also, they have two kinds of mustard.&nbsp; I&#039;m not usually a mustard fan, but they had a spicy sweet brown mustard that I tried and it&#039;s AWESOME.&nbsp; Seriously, this stuff would go so well with those $3 pretzels. <br /><br />So, we didn&#039;t stick around long since we only decided to have a beer each, but we comment that we look forward to bringing our friends here as it&#039;s a natural environment for group outings.&nbsp; <br /><br />Lastly, as we walked out I decided to locate a manager and ask if we could have a look at their event space.&nbsp; I&#039;m still at a loss of what to do for my wedding and it&#039;d be nice to keep it in Astoria if it were at all affordable.&nbsp; The space upstairs is HUGE and could easily accommodate a party of a few hundred.&nbsp; My party will hopefully be under 100, but they said could rearrange the space with partitions to break it up.&nbsp; The space has its own bar, a coat room, a bridal room, and it opens door open up to it&#039;s own private wrap-around deck that overlooks the garden.&nbsp; They&#039;re still working on the space, but it looks promising.&nbsp; The only downside for me is that they don&#039;t have their own built-in stereo system, so you&#039;re forced to bring in your own DJ or band.&nbsp; Oh, and one more thing, the space is very much sound proof.&nbsp; I could hardly hear the music and chattering from below.

				I was there Saturday afternoon and a bit later that night.&nbsp; Very nice place, really fun.&nbsp; I believe the outdoor part (with benches) is a tad smaller than the &quot;old&quot; Beer Garden, but the inside part is massive.&nbsp; They also have a huge deck outside which got packed when the benches were full.&nbsp; There was more than enough space.<br /><br />I think the price are a bit higher ($18 pitcher of Spaten apart from B.G.&#039;s $15) but it was such a fun time, I didn&#039;t care.&nbsp; Food looked great, too (I didn&#039;t have any since I had lunch beforehand).&nbsp; The bathrooms are a trip.&nbsp; Eight bathrooms for men and eight for women, but no stalls - each is their own room.&nbsp; Although I never endorse it, one could take a #2 if they had an emergency.&nbsp; Very private.&nbsp; Choosing the bathroom is like a game, checking to see which door is locked before you find an open one.&nbsp; My record is one locked before I found an open one, my worst is four.

				I approached S<sup>2</sup> on Sunday about 7pm when a guy stumbled out of the place and vomited onto the street. It looked too much like the Bohemian Beer Garden for me so I took a pass, but everyone I know who has been in there says it&#039;s glorious. Overpriced but glorious. I&#039;ll try it on a weekday afternoon when the amateurs are still in their offices. :roll:<br />

But, whatever.<br /><br />The only thing that was a little annoying was that if you sit at the bar in the evening, the sun shines right in your eyes if you&#039;re facing the door. This will change as the months go on, but maybe some sort of shades or something in the front windows would help. A minor complaint, and I could have moved or faced the other way, but then I wouldn&#039;t be facing my friends that I was with, so I just dealt with it :)

				i agree with what everyone said. the space is great, there are so many options/different seating areas. i suggest getting the pulled pork and fries, the bbq sauce is classic and delicious. <br />like other people mentioned, they need to work on their music selection. there was an hour of really bad soft-techno with no words, then they played a bob marley greatest hits cd in its entirety. i was often left confused.<br />i will definitely be going back!

				Went there tonight on this lovely Friday evening. It&#039;s nice, but the place was absolutely mobbed and really loud. The three of us were able to find space at a table, but we had to yell just to hold a conversation. The music was too loud and really unnecessary, considering it&#039;s a beer garden and people go there to chat and not to dance. Didn&#039;t try any food, but the beer was good. But due to the loudness we left after the one beer. Now I&#039;m wondering if the other beer garden will be a little more sensible to go back to. Maybe they can back off on the security guards walking around.<br /><br />Oh, and the bathrooms. You might think it&#039;s nice that everyone gets their own private restroom with a door that locks, complete with sink and mirror. However, when you have tons of girls who wish to fix their hair and makeup in the bathroom, therefore taking up an entire stall much longer than necessary, waiting to use the bathroom gets to be bad. Even the men&#039;s line was long.

				I just got home from this place.&nbsp; It was as Essen said: mobbed and loud.&nbsp; The loudness didn&#039;t bother our group of 5 and we were able to find seats outside pretty easily.&nbsp; &nbsp;We ate (a portobello mushroom burger with fries for me, a pretzel for my sis, and bratwurst &amp; fries for a friend), drink (seriously yummy sangria for me, beer for everyone else), and enjoyed the evening.&nbsp; I should mention that I felt a bit old for the place (I&#039;m in my 40s) and felt like things were starting to get a bit rowdy as we were leaving (fellas were friendly jostling, etc.).&nbsp; But overall I really liked it and am glad to have it right around the corner, though I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll be going on a weekend night anymore.&nbsp;

				Stopped in after work on yesterday.&nbsp; We got there at 4, right when it opened, so we basically got our pick of any table in the joint. My first impression of the place, that was better verbalized by another member of the group I was with that this was TGI Beergarden&#039;s.&nbsp; It&#039;s obvious that it&#039;s still very new, and that both a lot of money and attention to detail have been put into this place.&nbsp; We settled into our drinking, I started with a personal pitcher (a liter) of beer while I waited for more people to show up, and tried to take in the space a little more.&nbsp; I loved that there are more places to buy booze, and from the computerized registers, I incorrectly assumed that they took cards, which my girlfriend later found out was not the case, which is weird.&nbsp; Why bother with crazy computerized registers and receipts if you&#039;re not going to take cards?&nbsp; There are enough bars that they could easily have a dedicated charge only line.&nbsp; But I digress.&nbsp; I was really enjoying it, until about 9 or so.&nbsp; It got to the point where it was really crowded, and between the ambient noise of the crowd, the music (which was tolerable, but not great) and my poor hearing, I was having a really hard time carrying on a conversation. I was also not totally sold on the restrooms.&nbsp; The private stalls can and likely will become an issue.&nbsp; It was a great idea, but in practice, there&#039;s pretty much always going to be a line when you&#039;re expelling all that delicious beer. <br />All in all, it&#039;s nice having another large outdoor space where I can drink and smoke and conversate (if I&#039;m there early enough).&nbsp; I just think that this place will be utilized in the same way as Bohemian Hall for me, early Sunday drinking, as I&#039;m too tired to put up with a lot of the antics (beer pong, flip cup, push up contests, dancing on tables) that seem like are on their way.&nbsp; <br />My list of pros and cons: <br /><br />Pros: <br />+ Closer to home.<br />+ More beer selection and a wider range of non-beer drinks (the sangria on tap was a hit with my group).<br />+ Enough space, it seems both inside and outside. <br />+ Lots of space<br />+ It may shrink the crowd at Bohemian Hall<br />+ Outdoor, walk up grill<br />+ Nice, new everything, for now<br /><br />Cons: <br />- Nice, new everything (I like a little dinginess)<br />- Separate bathrooms<br />- Slightly more expensive - although the liter option seems like the more economical way to go vs pitchers<br />- The music was a little loud<br />- Too much Ed Hardy / bro dawg for my tastes

				Went with a group on Saturday- I am a fan. I like the layout, it seems more open. I didn&#039;t try any food, but it looked good as people were walking by with it. <br />I think the one thing I particularly liked about it over the Bohemian Hall is that there seemed to be less of a &quot;Meathead&quot; crowd. I didn&#039;t see as many fratboy types at Studio Square, but I suppose that&#039;s all just a matter of preference as far as the ambiance. <br />Overall, I give Studio Square the nod of approval.

				I think it&#039;s great to have options.&nbsp; I plan to spend time in a variety of places, though the Beer Garden is certainly closer to me, so I&#039;m more apt to go there (though for a drink I enjoy nearby Sparrow and 24, too).&nbsp; I am looking forward to checking out the Wunderbar beer garden and also the Ravel rooftop bar space, too.&nbsp; Fun in the sun!&nbsp; :D

				We went tonight and I&#039;m fairly impressed. The food was okay, prices were decent though a bit higher than Bohemian Hall, and I like both the interior and exterior (had to sit inside because of the weather). They&#039;ve probably won me over from Bohemian Hall&#039;s lackadaisical service, although I hope they expand their menu soon. Not many choices for the vegetarian crowd. <br /><br />Overall, a nice addition to the neighborhood.

				We had a get-together for about 15 last night at Studio Square, and they were very accommodating. Even though they are cash-only, the owner allowed us to set up a tab so we could just pay at the end of our night. We stayed indoors because it was a bit cold last night, but as has been said, it is very spacious inside with both small tables for 4-6 or large elevated bench tables seating over 15. The beer selection is excellent. The fries were very good (I like when you don&#039;t need to add salt), and the portions of food were reasonable. Staff were very attentive and polite.<br /><br />I have to reserve judgment on direct comparisons to Bohemian Hall because the weather didn&#039;t allow us the outdoor beer garden experience, but I hope to go back soon. In any event, it was great in its own right.

				No, Dewey you&#039;re right. My partner and I were in the back lounge at Brick one weekend evening and<br />this couple next to us had their baby with them. The little one started crying and fussing and they didn&#039;t want to<br />take her outside. Finally our waitress&nbsp; - who sensed that I was ready to lose it - spoke to them and they<br />moved to an outside table. <br /><br />My partner has two children, but we would never bring them there nor to a beer garden. There&#039;s a time<br />and place for kids and I think everyone ends up a lot happier when that&#039;s taken into consideration.<br /><br />

				What about a <em>Root Beer Garden</em> that is really an ice cream parlor?

				My wife and I just went there with our kids and a group of friends and their kids and everyone had a great time. It was 5 pm on Saturday and the place we amazingly packed, but the kids entertained themselves by the emergency exit and the parents were able to relax (a bit). The only thing that annoyed me were the people playing beer die right behind us, taking up a ton of space and always going off looking for their ball under our table. Seems a bit inconsiderate to me to be taking up so much space in a crowded spot.

				I&#039;m not weighing in on the question of kids at the beer garden (I could care less either way), but I do have a question:&nbsp; at Studio Square they card upon entry.&nbsp; Obviously with small children, it is clear that they wouldn&#039;t be drinking.&nbsp; But what about teenagers coming with adults?&nbsp; How does/should the beer garden deal with this?&nbsp; Do they decide by the age differential between teenager and &quot;adult&quot;?&nbsp; A 45 year old with a 17 year old, okay.&nbsp; A 22 year old with a 17 year old, not okay.&nbsp; Or no teenagers only small children.&nbsp; Or what?&nbsp; I am seriously asking this not because I have concerns (again, I could care less either way) but because I find the question interesting.

My bf and I walked through the other week to take a look. I did not like it and probably wouldn&#039;t go back by choice. I found it very sterile-- the smell of ammonia didn&#039;t help, the bathrooms are like corrals and I thought the beer was overpriced (a 1/2 liter, which is basically 1 pint was $7 to $9). The outdoor area is totally bizarre and dark b/c it&#039;s surrounded by buildings-- are those offices or apartments that overlook the sunken garden area? If apartments, I cannot imagine anyone wanting to live or work directly above/overlooking a beer garden (unless maybe if I was in a frat/sorority and even then I doubt it).<br /><br />Pluses was the large (overpriced) beer selection and the outdoor fireplace bar area (which of course was the most packed area of the outdoors).<br /><br />The owners obviously put a lot of money/work into it, so it&#039;s a shame, but overall me thinks it lacks personality.

				I keep forgetting to write about this.&nbsp; Studio Square now has a no baseball cap and do-rag policy.&nbsp; EVEN if you have the baseball cap in your bag!&nbsp; It&#039;s got to be the most stupid policy I&#039;ve ever heard, and they only seem to enforce it on the weekends.&nbsp; I went a couple saturdays ago with my boyfriend, and there was a long line to check IDs on their license checking machine, and they were checking bags.&nbsp; That&#039;s fine, I&#039;m used to that.&nbsp; But then the bouncer checks my boyfriend&#039;s bag and pulls out his baseball cap and holds it in front of him with this huge attitude face and doesn&#039;t say anything.&nbsp; Like we&#039;re supposed to know what&#039;s so bad about the hat.&nbsp; So I say what&#039;s wrong?&nbsp; He says you&#039;re not allowed in with a hat.&nbsp; I get upset and say &quot;It&#039;s a hat!!!&quot;&nbsp; I could not understand what was possibly so wrong with a hat being in his bag!!!&nbsp; Even if he was not wearing it!!!&nbsp; It was so ridiculous.&nbsp; Then he said &quot;I know it&#039;s a hat.&quot;&nbsp; We ask what&#039;s wrong with a hat, he says it&#039;s establishment policy and it&#039;s on the door.&nbsp; And sure enough, there is a sign on the door saying no baseball caps or do-rags.&nbsp; Here it is, a casual beer garden, and you can&#039;t even go in with a baseball cap.&nbsp; Then of course, someone walks out with a cap on right in front of us.&nbsp; When we point this out to him, he concedes that we can &quot;check it in&quot;.&nbsp; Well, why didn&#039;t you tell us this earlier?&nbsp; Instead of copping a whole attitude?&nbsp; Turns out the check in room is just a rack to the side, where they will put your hat, but no one mans it and no tickets are given out.&nbsp; So it&#039;s not like it&#039;s a real check in room.&nbsp; <br /><br />Regardless, I still think it&#039;s the stupidest policy I&#039;ve heard of, and I&#039;m writing this as a warning to all you guys to watch what you wear there.&nbsp; Last night, they did not enforce the policy, so it must be only on the weekends.&nbsp; So ridiculous.&nbsp; Cuz we know all baseball caps are inherently dangerous.&nbsp; :roll:

				Yeah, honestly, it leaves a bad taste in your mouth when that happens to you, and I&#039;m not sure my boyfriend wants to go back either.&nbsp; Funny how some places are so anxious to turn away good business.&nbsp; I know the owners probably have more money than they know what to do with, so why should they care.&nbsp; It&#039;s a real shame because I really do like the place, but after that happened, it was a huge turnoff.

				We went kinda early last night, and it wasn&#039;t so bad. Of course, we did manage to beat the crowds.&nbsp; :mrgreen: It&#039;s like a scrubbed-up, trendy Bohemian, with none of the soul. A pitcher was $18, not too bad as it got the two of us borderline drunk (third person didn&#039;t show up in time.) <br />If you&#039;re over 30, or just not into the frat scene, or are dragging some hipster spawn along, best to go off-hours IMO.<br /><br />As for the party room, that seems typical for places around here. When we sought a venue, the rates were astronomical for what was offered. We thought it would be the opposite- rent a space for cheap, get catering- but you&#039;re better off price-wise going to a place that specializes in weddings. Prices include food, parking, service, etc. etc. if you can get out to LawnGyland.

				The scanners record your name, license#, dob and expiration date.&nbsp; I have yet to be put on any mailing lists for studio square or any of the 100&#039;s of different places I&#039;ve been to from here to Vegas.&nbsp; I also check my credit every year and no misshaps yet.&nbsp; paraniod...?&nbsp; Try using your passport, they don&#039;t scan those.&nbsp; However, if someone really really wanted your info on your license they wouldn&#039;t need to go and obtain an illegal piece of hardware that records your license address.&nbsp; Simple &quot;shoulder surfing&quot; would do the trick and be a lot cheaper.<br /><br />As for the no hat policy.&nbsp; My sympathy goes to all of you that have to deal with this hardship :cry:.&nbsp; Awful people at S2.&nbsp; Fraternity&#039;s and sororities go to both beer gardens and the no hat policy does little to deter.

				I find the practice of scanning licenses at bars outrageous and would never, ever go there. I think everybody should boycott establishments that did this on principle.

It&#039;s not like the bar is using the info to spam me. I&#039;m not getting postcards in the mail. Bartenders aren&#039;t knocking on my door asking where I&#039;ve been lately. No harm, no foul. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll be boycotting bars that use these anytime soon. Bars that have silly hat rules however...
