				My apartment is always cold even when the heat is &quot;on.&quot;<br /><br />Where in Astoria can I find an inexpensive space heater, preferably somewhere pretty near the Astoria Blvd subway station?<br />

				Don&#039;t get a cheap space heater, especially for your bedroom. They&#039;re noisy (they use a fan to blow air over a heating element) and probably less safe. Spend the money to get an oil-filed electric radiator type of space heater. Amazon has a bunch (http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mozilla-20&amp;index=blended&amp;link_code=qs&amp;field-keywords=oil%20space%20heater&amp;sourceid=Mozilla-search) for $50-70, it looks like... I&#039;d be very surprised if you could find one closer than the Home Depot...<br /><br />Also, if you have windows you can plastic up, that makes a huge difference. And it&#039;s a lot cheaper than using 18 cent/kWh electricity to heat your space...!

				Well i have a/c cut outs in the walls and even with the covers on , they seemed to be allowing &nbsp;a draft . I went to home depot to see if i could find some insulation of some type but they told me they didnt have any but the kind with fiberglass in it and that would be no good unless it was in a wall . so i did my own insulation along with thick black plastic bags (in the wall cutout ) along with plastic tape . &nbsp;Then i used quilted a/c vent covers on the inside part of the house &nbsp;of the unit to lock up any leaking air coming in &nbsp;since it also &nbsp;sucks out any heat coming out of the base boards . &nbsp;Windows on the other hand unless they are old and not double paned (less than one piece of glass thick ) might not be the problem . &nbsp;It might be the actually seals where they connect as they close . &nbsp;For that u can easily buy some insulation tape/foam which is sticky on one side and padded foam on the other . &nbsp;Then the connecting part of the on the window once it meets the frame of the window the seal will be much better .This also goes for doors &nbsp;all around the frame . Drafts can come in and set your apt degrees lower which make a big difference . Dollar store on ditmars and 31st has really good cheap priced insulation tape . &nbsp; A great way to tell if or where any draft is coming in &nbsp;is to use a candle , blow it out and then &nbsp;as the smoke rises &nbsp;place it near a door or window and u will see any draft &nbsp;blowing in . &nbsp;

				Costco also had some heaters for under 100 dollars .&nbsp; One looked like a fan u would place on a desk or table and it glows orange red&nbsp; and gives out heat .&nbsp; U can stand infront of it at costco and u&nbsp; feel how powerfull it is .&nbsp; Only thing is it seems u have to be infront of it to feel it . Maybe in a smaller room , its different .&nbsp; They also have some other types that look like radiators&nbsp; &nbsp;and they all pretty much tell u how much power they consume .

If you apply it correct and tightly, it will be like it&#039;s not even there. It will prevent you from being able to open the windows at all on nice days, however, but I don&#039;t find that too much of an inconvenience. Light will definitely still get through.

				I once had a Vornado brand space heater and it worked great.&nbsp; &nbsp;Was nice and quiet and had temperature settings that kicked it on and off as needed.<br /><br />http://www.vornado.com/CategoryDetail.aspx?ISC_Category=Heaters
