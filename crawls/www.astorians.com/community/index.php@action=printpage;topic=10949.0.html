				Specifically, for me, there&#039;s a 50% chance at any given moment that ESPN HD, SNY HD, and ESPN2 HD will not come in at all, or come in extremely garbled/stuttering/messed up.<br /><br />Anyone else in Astoria getting poor TWC cable TV service or is it just me?<br /><br />Thanks.

				someone tried to steal my cable last week and opened up my cable box, tried to hook up their own cable into my box, then when they couldnt&#039; get it to work (with digital cable now the cable company has to send a signal to the box to activate) they left the box all tore up and unhooked.

				I&#039;ve been getting that stuttering, frozen picture on Lifetime. I rarely watch it, but <br />since Army Wives started up again, I&#039;ve been taping it and it happens at least 2x <br />in one hour. <br /><br />TWC always says to reboot the box, but I get tired of doing that for one channel.<br />I have the digital cable box, but not the hi-def one.

				The Audio on YES for me has gone out twice lately.&nbsp; Yesterday and the last time they broadcast on chanel 9.<br /><br />Everyonce in a while, my picture freezes and the only way I can clear it up is by getting off that chanel and getting back.&nbsp; This does not make me happy when it&#039;s a program I may want to rewind, etc.<br /><br />I had NO, NONE, ZIP problems before I upgraded to my HD box.&nbsp; &nbsp;I was told it&#039;s a newer style box and that NOBODY likes it. (by someone who works for time warner)<br /><br />My advice is to call and complain about it as much as you can as they will likely give you free HBO for 30 days or whatever for your inconvienience.&nbsp; :-)

				I have ESPN on right now, no problems. Regular non-HD DVR box (it says Explorer 8300 on it). Granted, I don&#039;t watch sports too often, so I don&#039;t know if I would have had problems on this channel recently, but its been fine this afternoon.<br /><br />I have a friend who has an HD box from Time Warner and has had nothing but problems.

				Is it constant?<br /><br />By the way, the problem I detailed in my original post was fixed by a TW technician.&nbsp; Apparently some of the cables in the roof of the building needed to be replaced.&nbsp; <br /><br />Maybe you have a similar problem.&nbsp; I guess you may have to deal with the crappy customer service and get a tech out to your place.

				Last night my Time Warner box reset itself while I was surfing the OnDemand channels, and at the moment I have nothing but a black screen on all current channels.<br /><br />I guess after I finish breakfast I&#039;ll try to find tech support.&nbsp; I wonder if there are systemwide problems?<br /><br />UPDATE:&nbsp; I called and got right through to a very helpful rep who reset my signal and walked me through the process to get it working.&nbsp; In the meantime I discovered that there is in fact a service outage in Woodside this morning, though whether or not that killed my box is unclear.&nbsp; Either way, I&#039;m now sitting back down to watch what&#039;s left of the Sunday morning pundits.

				I almost always have problems with the HD channels. Usually the picture gets stuck for a couple of seconds or the audio dies out for a few seconds.. doesn&#039;t seem like a big deal, but when you&#039;re watching a show and it happens a few times, you really miss what&#039;s going on, lol.<br /><br />I always DVR shows on the non-HD channels because I&#039;m afraid it&#039;ll be frozen when I watch it later on.

				I know this is a little off topic, but check to see if RCN Cable is in your area. I just got it, the service is great - the installation person was really cool (we have a problem with the phone being set up and the guy gave us his cell number and then he called me Saturday to update me), plus I was able to lock in a two year rate of $129 for cable (with all premium channels), phone, and internet service! I didn&#039;t have many problems with TWC, but the rates were a lot lower for more service on RCN, so I decided to go with them.

				Thank goodness I wasn&#039;t the only one.<br />&nbsp;I splurged for a humongoid flat screen last night and was trying to watch the Yankee game in HD today and it was stuttering a ton. I almost convinced myself it was related to me buying a lemon. But it seems to have eased up as the game ended around 5. But the first few innings were so maddening I was forced to go out for a walk and EEEEEK!!! listen to Bob and Suzyn.

				We have RCN and it&#039;s been great, until Sci Fi channel started sputtering. And sputtering to the point of missing chunks of the show both live and recorded shows, and it happened during Dr Who (the episode before the last one that just aired) and i was waiting for that episode! It ruined it for me and I can&#039;t watch it, and itunes only has the BBCA seasons, so they are a season behind. Bollocks. Naturally after we called and they said they would send out a tech, it stopped. But on the whole we haven&#039;t complained nearly as much as you TW folks. That being said, the rates for the full package have gone up and we&#039;re thinking of shopping around. You TW customers, once the into package (i think it&#039;s $99/mo for the cable internet and phone at first) what did your rate go up to? We may be able to get RCN to drop the price (I really don&#039;t want TW, I&#039;ve had it before and the only saving grace was my best friend worked CS and I would just call her directly for help..she&#039;s no longer in CS though) but John is seriously considering switching providers to save some $$.<br />Would saving money be worth the aggravation most of you have experienced with TW? <br />What are your thoughts?

According to the customer service representative, they are raising the rates in September, so it was best for me to just lock in a price right now.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t want to go through the hassle of changing my e-mail address and I have sort of got used to TW.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=10949.msg144260.html#msg144260">Quote from: firelight79 on August 05, 2008, 01:14:56 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">and it happened during Dr Who (the episode before the last one that just aired) and i was waiting for that episode! <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I was a huge fan of the old Doctor Who.&nbsp; I started watching the new series, but I haven&#039;t really followed it like I did with the original.

				Two of us in our building have the same fairly new Panasonic plasma and we have TWC.&nbsp; We also experience the stuttering.&nbsp; Also a 2 second lag when going from regular to HD channels.&nbsp; And we upgraded to Monster HDMI cables and more.&nbsp; Anyway, we called both Panasonic and TWC.&nbsp; Of course, it&#039;s not the TV.&nbsp; TWC said they have &quot;signal strength issues&quot; with their HD channels.&nbsp; That they&#039;re working on it.&nbsp; And that rebooting the box might help. I&#039;m convinced that the reboot is only a psychological exercise and it does pretty much nothing.&nbsp; We know people in our building that went with RCN.&nbsp; They hate it.&nbsp; They say that the they took a teaser rate and then the prices jump very high.&nbsp; (I think they should have read the fine print but whatever).&nbsp; And that RCN customer service is in India and very bad.&nbsp; Something about describing a phenomenon happening in Astoria to someone in Mombai.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know.&nbsp; Well - I think Fios may save us all.&nbsp; But there is a wait.&nbsp; Dishes aren&#039;t an option for us.

Their offices are in Woodside, we speak to people in Woodside. John has actually said the CS at RCN is better than most CS he deals with.<br /><br />It sounds like the HD channel issues are universal no matter which provider you have. We have the lag between them as well. and occasionally a few burps when recording HD.<br />Right now my big issue is Sci Fi channel coming in screwy when I want to watch my shows! I swear if it happens whenever Battlestar comes back I will go apeshit! But considering I work out to Stargate reruns, I need my Sci Fi....never mind that it does exist in HD, just not in RCNs world. That&#039;s another big issue with RCN, they have a very poor selection of HD. I think they are gradually adding them to not have the signal strength issues that TW has, but I am just speculating on that. I&#039;d like to think they aren&#039;t cheaping out on us.

				I spent an hour on the phone with Time Warner today arguing over administrative stuff: name changes, account numbers, etc.&nbsp; Everyone there keeps telling me something different, and I can&#039;t take them.&nbsp; I know it&#039;s not the exact topic of this posting, but it is a relief to see that there are other options; I thought it was Time Warner or nothing.&nbsp; I am intrigued by RCN.&nbsp; I want to switch!&nbsp; Or else I am going to get itnernet some other way and just cancel cable.&nbsp; That&#039;s how aggravated they made me.

				i tried to get internet from a company other than twc. so i signed up for earthlink. but guess who my bill comes from - twc. i don&#039;t think you can really get away from it. however, i&#039;m okay with no cable since i can watch tv on the internet. plus, netflix is cheaper...

It is also possible that the digital and conventional signals arrive at the cable by different routes. Thus viewing a stations digital and conventional broadcasts side-by-side, it&#039;s likely that the digital one will be delayed.<br /><br />If, on the other hand, you mean that there is a pause between when you select the channel and when the picture finally appears, that is inherent in the process too.&nbsp; One technique employed to reduce the amount of data is that, most of the time, the encoded signal carries the difference between the previous frame and the current one. Then every so often, a full &quot;key&quot; frame is sent.&nbsp; When you first tune to a digital station, the picture generally won&#039;t appear until the next &quot;key&quot; frame comes along.<br /><br />If the signal is weak, the decoder will detect errors that it cannot &quot;paint over&quot;. Typically, it will freeze the display until it can resynchronize on the next key frame.<br /><br />I have read that some cable systems are decoding then reëncoding some HD signals at higher compression ratios (or lower picture quality) in order to cram more channels through their infrastructure.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know which are said to do this though. The recoding would add delay to the signal chain.&nbsp; And generally, decoding a more highly compressed signal involves more latency.<br /><br />That about exhausts my knowledge on the subject.

We rarely have any internet problems. I think the last time was last year when we had that rain storm that shut down the trains, and I then sprained my ankle on my 5th walk to the train stop on 46th. Other than that it&#039;s fine.<br />Honestly the only issue we are having now is that we are paying a lot for the bundled package, the rate keeps going up. And the times the signal comes in screwy is when there is something we want to watch. Also John wants more HD channels. Does TW have BBCA-HD? That and Sci Fi HD are the ones we really want. So far it seems like the best bet for HD channels is satellite, but I&#039;m never going back to it unless it is the only game in town. Every time it got really cloudy I would lose tv. Annoying! I&#039;d like to think it&#039;s just working out the kinks in this whole HD thing but at this point they should really have their acts together-and that goes for RCN as well as TW.<br /><br />BTW-can anyone tell me, if they have the full bundled package, what their rate went up to after the intial introductory offer expired? I don&#039;t want to switch over (and learn all new channels again) only to have the bill go right up to what we are currently paying after a few months. If you don&#039;t want to post it publicly, could you pm me? Thanks! Anyone who wants to know RCN pricing-i&#039;d be happy to fish out a bill and tell you our current rates. This could help us all choose between the lesser of two evils.&nbsp; :evil:

				I finally broke down and called TWC regarding my cable problems over the past 2 weeks (freezing blocks on the screen, audio problems). They told me they had no reports of any problems in my neighborhood (Broadway/Steinway). So, perhaps as we&#039;re discussing it, we should all call to report it, so they can get on it.
