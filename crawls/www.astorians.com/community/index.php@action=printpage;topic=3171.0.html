				Duluoz cats inspired me and i&#39;ve seen some other kid pics in here. <br /><br />How about for the month of September we all put in a pic of ourselves from the early years.<br /><br />Just a thought and probably worth hours of fun and commentary.&nbsp; Maybe this could be the start of themed months? <br />&nbsp;<br /><div>You can always change the pic throughout the month but it must be a kid pic.</div><br />

				So I was definitely noticing more &quot;kid pics&quot; while I was trying to catch up on the boards.&nbsp; It did cross my mind and I became very curious because I first noticed Alison changed hers, and then JustDesserts... and I was like.. .what&#39;s going on?!!?!<br /><br />THEN.... I find this thread!&nbsp; What a relief that it wasn&#39;t some kind of conspiracy!<br /><br />I think I will need to call home and have them scan a pic for me.&nbsp; It&#39;s been a bit since I&#39;ve seen one.&nbsp; My earliest is my HS senior pic.&nbsp; For now, it&#39;ll be that until I get a &quot;younger&quot; pic.

I wish there were a way we could see them enlarged.<br /><br />MegC&#39;s the only person I&#39;ve met on here (yet! but hope to make it to Taco Crawl!) who&#39;s put up a pic that I can see, and I have to agree - it looks just like you!
