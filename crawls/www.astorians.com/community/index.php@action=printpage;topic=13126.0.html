				Hey all, back after a hiatus.<br /><br />Anyway, it&#039;s Holiday Shopping Season, everyone&#039;s broke, and nobody wants to go near department stores.&nbsp; So, how about everyone tagging up links/info for local craft/artisan fairs?<br /><br />I&#039;ll get the ball rolling:<br /><br />Union Square--their usual holiday thing is going on as of Dec. 1 IIRC.<br /><br />Brooklyn--3rd Ward Holiday Craft Fair http://www.3rdward.com/handmadeholiday<br /><br />Manhattan -- BUST Holiday Craftacular http://www.bust.com/Craftacular/BUST-Holiday-Craftacular-2008.html&nbsp; (btw this is a REALLY good one)<br /><br />Manhattan--the Knitting Factory Handmade Cavalcade&nbsp; http://www.thenewnewny.com/handmadecavalcade/&nbsp; (note this is a new one IIRC).<br /><br />Please add!<br /><br />

				Waltz-Astoria on Ditmars will be having one for the next 3 Sundays.<br />There will be both handmade items and gently used/vintage clothing-for the frugal Astorian.<br /><br />I&#039;ll be participating with my jewelry collection. Hope you all can pop by one of the Sundays and say hi! Look for Firelight Jewelry (should be easy to remember given my screen name).

				<br />Hi there,<br /><br />I run a handmade kid t-shirt biz from my home in Astoria.&nbsp; I sell them at a market in Brooklyn every weekend, along with several other designers and their handmade goods. I thought I should add this to your list:<br /><br />Brooklyn Indie Market in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn.<br />http://brooklynindiemarket.com/<br /><br />It&#039;s open every weekend until the end of December, and there is a special event on Dec. 20 and 21:<br />http://brooklynindiemarket.com/events.php<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Final one at Waltz is this Sunday 10-6pm. Come on out and get in your last minute holiday shopping!<br />FWIW I have handmade jewelry with all sorts of fun new styles. and in addition I have 2 bins of Calvin Klein and Izod men&#039;s dress shrits, all with matching ties. The shirts are 34/35 and 15 or 15 1/2&quot; neck. The ties are all Calvin Klein and Izod (or a prototype of them with no label).<br />So come and get a present for mom and dad!<br />I only know that there are 2 other jewelry vendors and I am not sure what the other 7 spots will be. I think one will be original artwork. Anyhoo, it&#039;ll be fun! <br />Please come by and say hi...i don&#039;t know how I will survive all those hours of christmas without some human contact!<br /><br />btw-the markets at union square, bryant park and columbus circle are really fun and y&#039;all should check them out before they are gone! great interesting last minute gifts.

				Hey everyone.......I have a venue here in Astoria that is willing to let me organize a local craft fair/flea market type of thing.&nbsp; It wouldn&#039;t be until after the holidays, but I&#039;m thinking the 1st sat in February and possibly once a month following that, depending on turnout.&nbsp; Space would be approximately $40-$50 for a table and 2 chairs.&nbsp; How many people are interested?&nbsp; I usually sell my jewelry at the Hudson St market in the city, but I think Astoria could use something like this.

				I&#039;d be interested as well but could the price come down if you don&#039;t need the table and chairs? It seems like an awful lot of money for a space especially in Astoria. How big would the space be?<br />I usually pay $25-30 for a 4&#039;x4&#039; space. I have a 3x3 table and my own comfy chair. Thanks for the info and for trying to organize something like this, it&#039;s really cool.
