				Anyone else watching?<br />What do you think of the final four? (three - how do we really count it?)<br />What&#039;d folks think of the fan favorite?&nbsp; I know I was pleased, but surprised.<br />Anyone have a favorite designer from this season?<br />Predictions as to the final winner?

				Christian was one of my faves, so I&#039;m not surprised. I get a kick out of him b/c he&#039;s such a little beotchy brat and he knows it. :) I really like his pieces too... I think he&#039;s only 21, so its cool to see someone so young have so much promise. &quot;Sewww FIERCE!&quot;<br /><br />As for the final 3/4<br />I wish Victorya would have made it a little farther, I liked her work. Jillian has grown on me. The jacket and gold lame dress from the last challenge was so cool. I guess I like Rami&#039;s work better than Chris... I&#039;m just so sick of all the draping.<br /><br />

				I think I like Jillian the most. Personality-wise she&#039;s a little too aloof, but I like her style. The collars are interesting and I like how the clothes fit and look.. most of the time.

				I agree with the fan favorite being &quot;Ferocia Couteura (too funny)&quot; aka Christian. He&#039;s can be a little bitch, but I think he gets the joke and he&#039;s a fantastic designer.<br /><br />I personally am not blown away by one designer over the next, but I think Jillian has staying power. Rami&#039;s stuff is great, but it kind of reminds me of Laura from Season 3 - often the same thing over and over again.

				I am all for Jillian.&nbsp; I love the fact that she tries new things.&nbsp; As for Christian, I am a bit over the fierceness.<br /><br />However, as with most reality shows, the winner, ends up being more limited contractually than the one in second place.&nbsp; So for that reason, I think I would rather have Jillian come in second.

				I am at peace with the winner.<br /><br />Just before they announced the winner I decided that I&#039;d be okay with any of them winning, but that Jillian was the only one who annoyed me as a person. I was secretly happy, though surprised that she was out first.<br /><br />Christian looked like he was SURE he was out. I believe he was genuinely surprised. He&#039;s good. He deserves it. Rami and Jillian will have careers, I&#039;m sure.

				I want to see Chris March&#039;s collection!!!<br /><br />I liked all of the collections shown in the finals.&nbsp; I thought Christians was the most dramatic.&nbsp; I wonder what makes Christians work haute couture yet Chris&#039; is costumey??&nbsp; <br /><br />Christian&#039;s work didn&#039;t suprise me - I expected him to do amazing work.&nbsp; Rami and Jillian did surprise b/c they were both SOOO good.&nbsp; But I agree with the judges on Rami&#039;s - what is up with his color choices???<br /><br />For once I loved the outfit that Jillian was wearing - aka fishermans sweater turned into strapless dress.&nbsp; Cute.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />
