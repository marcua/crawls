			This show is the best thing about radio today (especailly considering how lame the NY commerical radio market is). I encourage every human being on the planet to listen to KCRW. Nic Harcourt is cool, but Jason Bentley is AWESOME! He does a show called Metropolis every weeknight on KCRW. Also podcasted. Liza Richardson used to do a show called The Drop that is also really really good for discovering the best of new indie music. And of course, the immortal Garth Trinidad is iconic LA soul with Chocolate City. Viva La KCRW!
