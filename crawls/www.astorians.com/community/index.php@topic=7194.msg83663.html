								<div class="inner" id="msg_83651">Debbie, since I think some comments I made in the thread regarding the service at Pita Pan prompted you to start this thread, let me say this.<br /><br />First of all, I am Greek myself.&nbsp; So there&#039;s no anti-Greek bias coming from me.&nbsp; But at the same time, I&#039;m not going to favor one place over another just because it is Greek or Cypriot owned if I don&#039;t like the service or the product there.<br /><br />Second, I was referring more to the type of service, prices and ambiance that you get at these places.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been to every single one on 30th avenue, starting from Plaza Lounge and going all the way up to Flo.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also been to Omonia, Kolonaki, Tre, and Lefkos Pirgos.&nbsp; I&#039;m quite familiar with all of them, though I am not someone that you&#039;ll see at the cafes every day or even every weekend.<br /><br />What I find obnoxious about them, and which prevents me from going more often, as I mentioned, is the service and the overall attitude of some who are there (both employed and as patrons).&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ll use Athens Cafe for one example.&nbsp; I find their prices to be obnoxiously high, the highest of any of the establishments on 30th.&nbsp; A souvlaki sandwich, for instance, without any fries or chips or anything else, costs $8.25 there.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t seen it anywhere else for less than $6 and usually less than $5.&nbsp; Combine that with the fact that I&#039;ve found the service there to often be very slow and subpar, and it&#039;s really not worth it.&nbsp; If I want to people-watch, there&#039;s many other places I can do so.<br /><br />As far as the loud music/vibe and so forth....it is true that you see a lot of people who really are there to &quot;impress&quot;, with their fast cars which they make a point of revving up in front of the cafes to impress everyone sitting outside, guys in muscle tees and so on just being loud and obnoxious.&nbsp; Some places more than others blast the music as well, though nothing as loud as I heard yesterday at Pita Pan.&nbsp; And yes, some music is nice and you don&#039;t expect these places to be a library, but when it gets to the point where you can&#039;t hear anything anyone with you is telling you, when you can&#039;t have a conversation and are reduced to just sitting there and staring at other people, including people who seem to be there exclusively to be stared at, then it&#039;s just not an enjoyable experience anymore.&nbsp; One of the reasons people go out is to socialize, but under those circumstances, I find it hard to do so.<br /><br />Astoria is full of wonderful places.&nbsp; As someone else pointed out, the cafes on 30th serve a specific niche.&nbsp; But, Debbie, as someone who is also of Greek descent and indeed who has traveled to Greece many, many times and will be going again in a week, I can say also that the cafes on 30th give a certain impression of Greek people and establishments that is not wholly accurate.&nbsp; Just because I&#039;m Greek, doesn&#039;t mean that I will follow the herd and go to these places just because other Greeks do.&nbsp; And having experienced Greece, including living there for up to a few months at a time, I know that there&#039;s many other types of Greek establishments that can exist.&nbsp; Sometimes I like to go to a place where yes, I can enjoy a frappe or a baklava or a freddo but without the showoffs in flashy clothes and flashy cars, the loud music, the high prices, and the slow service.&nbsp; And while it hasn&#039;t been reflected so much in this thread, I&#039;ve seen many tongue-in-cheek comments made about the places on 30th by other posters on this site, so I know I&#039;m not alone.&nbsp; Ultimately, people will go to the places they enjoy, and fortunately, Astoria has plenty of establishments for all tastes.&nbsp; If I am not crazy about the 30th Avenue cafe scene, I&#039;m entitled to that feeling and it shouldn&#039;t be construed as some sort of bias or anger.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure that everyone here has places they enjoy and places that they typically avoid for whatever reason.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_83654">I live on 33rd Street between 30th and 31st Avenues. While I can appreciate the safety that Athens Cafe has brought to the area -- it&#039;s presence has made 30th Avenue alive late at night, making a walk down the avenue from the train seem less dark and scary -- it, along with the other cafes along 30th Avenue, have also increased traffic and made parking in the area more difficult for those of us who live there. Last night (Saturday night) for example, I spent 45 minutes trying to park my car. It&#039;s worse during the summer, and worse on the weekends. Cars go zooming down the block and careen around the corner, making crossing the street at Newtown/30th Avenue very dangerous. <br /><br />The foot traffic is pretty bad too. People walk down the street late at night, talking really loudly, inconsiderate of the fact that they&#039;re walking down a residential street where there are people trying to sleep at 2 a.m. <br /><br />I have nothing against the cafes, but it would be great if they could or would send the message to their patrons to be considerate of the folks who live in the neighborhood. Or it would be great if the 114th Precinct could maintain more of a presence in the area on weekend nights to address the traffic and noise concerns -- it seems bizarre to me that there are NEVER any cops around 30th Avenue on the weekend nights when throngs of people flock to the area. <br /><br />I was born in Astoria, and live in the apartment I was raised in, so believe me when I say that it wasn&#039;t always like this -- the increase in both pedestrian and vehicular traffic has come along with the influx of cafes in the area. Coincidence? I think not. <br /><br /></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_83658">Lots of interesting replies.<br /><br />Some comments:<br /><br />Neo - I do not care for the term &#039;Euro-trash&#039; and I do not care about any comments regarding Pita Pan.&nbsp; I have never been there and will probably never go.&nbsp; Also, what restaurant would allow you to sit there for a couple of hours sipping coffee, hence the high prices.&nbsp; And, you know as well as I do that these days a Frappe in a suburb of Athens would set you as back as one in Astoria.&nbsp; <br /><br />Flinxt - Since we moved here in 1973, there has actually been an INCREASE in Greek owned businesses, vs a decrease!&nbsp; Some examples:<br /><br />Christos Steakhouse (used to be something else)<br />Demetris<br />Anna&#039;s Corner<br />Stamatis on Broadway<br />Kyclades (I think the owner is an Albanian Greek)<br />Mezzo Mezzo (I think they are Greeks)<br />Mediterranean in the little mall<br />Artopolis<br />Titan<br />Martha&#039;s (George is a Greek American)<br />Astoria Fish Market<br />Zenon<br />Zodiac<br />Athens Restaurant<br /><br />Just add to the list folks.&nbsp; Greeks may have moved out, but they come here to shop, eat and party.<br /><br />Alexa - What prompted this thread are the deragatory comments regarding the cafes and those who frequent them.&nbsp; Anyone can write whatever they wish, however, I am feeling a hint of disdain and perhaps a bit of bias.&nbsp; Cafes have been around for years - remember Hilton, Edelweiss on Broadway, and the ever lasting Lefkos Pirgos?&nbsp; Athens has also been around for years.&nbsp; There are new ones like Grand, Flo, and semi new ones like Avenue.&nbsp; I think they are part of the fabric of the area and are here to stay.&nbsp; If they were not successful, they would close down; obviously, they are doing well.&nbsp; <br /><br />My eighty year old mother and I visit a cafe every Saturday.&nbsp; We sit there, chat, have an expensive frappe, get smoke blown in our faces, languish in the sun, make friends with the people at the table next to us, listen to too loud obnoxious music and have a good time.&nbsp; We are not Euro-trash and love our Saturday afternoons at Astoria cafes!<br /><br /><br /></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_83662">Debbie, I honestly don&#039;t feel that any bias or disdain was ever intended.&nbsp; Clearly, &quot;euro-trash&quot; is not a nice term to use and I personally hope it won&#039;t be used anymore but the bottom line is that people seem to be reacting to real issues like pricing, noise, parking issues, etc. rather than against Greeks as an ethnic group which is what you seem to be saying - maybe I am wrong.&nbsp; The great thing about Astoria is that there are so many different types of restaurants and cafes that appeal to different tastes and it&#039;s OK for people to like some and not like others.&nbsp; Also, if people do not like a type of ethnic restaurant or business I don&#039;t necessarily see it as a slight against the particular ethnic group.&nbsp; I guess I just don&#039;t see the comments about cafes as being an ethnic issue.</div>

The pig is going to come from Gianni the butcher, the bread from Maria the mother in law and the mozzarella from the giant water buffalo that lives in the backyard! It&#039;s not going to come from a bag and it is going to reflect the class of the residents that live there, the working class farmers &amp; laborers.&nbsp; That&#039;s what I don&#039;t understand. Why is Astoria European in tone and community, but lacks the religion of the daily European, the food that they eat and the wine that they drink.<br /><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color"><em>Ahh, let me discuss this for a moment.&nbsp; The new cafes are set up and run by the offspring of the old school community.&nbsp; The young owners obviously put the importance on socializing and drinks rather than the food.&nbsp; I&#039;d agree with you that if we were in Greece the food would most likely be top notch and reflect the local fare.&nbsp; Hate to say this but even one of the newer restaurants may be slacking off on the food and focusing on the drinks meeting place idea instead.&nbsp; What a waste.</em></span><br /><br />The Spanish cafes will serve Spanish food, not Velveeta cheese on Wonderbread. And that&#039;s exactly the difference.&nbsp; <br /><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color"><em>It was the music that I was referring to not the food.</em></span><br /><br />In 5 years Astoria will be called Little Greece and consist of one block where Greek maitre d&#039;s stand outside restaurants waving you in. Tourists in shorts and flip flops will walk around in packs and exclaim to each other, &quot;This is exactly like that tour we took in Athens, Eilene!&quot;&nbsp; We&#039;ll be paying $2000 for a studio on 21st street and count ourselves lucky that we don&#039;t have to live on 215th street and the turnpike. <br /><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color"><em>Please don&#039;t ever say this again as it may become reality.</em></span><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_83687">What I don&#039;t like about these cafés are the things that have been mentioned in other threads - <br />they&#039;re overpriced, service is often border-line snotty, if not outright rude and the food is mediocre<br />most of the time.<br /><br />I also resent the fact that the ones with outdoor spaces take up so much of the sidewalk that <br />we, the neighborhood residents who live on these blocks, have so little space to walk. That may<br />sound petty to some, but why should I have to walk in the gutter so that someone sipping a <br />coffee for two hours at Athens cafe can sit in the middle of the sidewalk? It&#039;s often impossible to have<br />two-way pedestrian traffic on 29th St., especially from 5:30 on when people are getting home from<br />work/school, etc. <br /><br />I make a point of not patronizing these places because they often serve cheap liquor in top-shelf bottles - <br />and that comes straight from a bartender I knew who worked at Athens for a while - and food that&#039;s not<br />even fresh - that from a cashier at Tradefair who told me how cafe personnel were coming in to buy old<br />bread, cheap produce, etc.<br /><br />These are not the same cafes you find in the Piazza Venezia or the Champs Elysee&nbsp; -- please.<br /><br /></div>

I never did and I sincerely apologize if you have taken offense. It wasn&#039;t my intent.<br /><br />But unless I&#039;m mistaken, in your previous posting you point out that you feel it&#039;s only a matter of what you consider &#039;real issues&#039;, i.e., prices, parking and noise, that people are reacting to in criticizing so-called &#039;euro-cafes&#039;.<br /><br />All I was trying to point is that, no, to me it doesn&#039;t seem to be just that. It&#039;s more than the impact they may or may not have, it seems to be their very existence that annoys some people and their (not yours) choice of words leaves much to be desired.<br /><br /></div>
