								<div class="inner" id="msg_109757">I suppose my reasoning for posting the above article is related to an apex of financial events that I know I&#039;m not alone in experiencing.&nbsp; I&#039;ve lived in Astoria for 7 years now.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had some career advances, and in some ways life has become more comfortable.&nbsp; But at in the last couple of years, despite those career advances, everything is getting more expensive.&nbsp; I&#039;m getting my annual raise at work in Feb, but it is already all accounted for because of the things I list below.&nbsp; So my standard of living is staying level at best.&nbsp; My health insurance premium is going up significantly, my co-pay has just gone up to $25/visit so I can&#039;t afford to go to physical therapy, my lease renews in April, and despite what is still a very good deal on my apartment, it&#039;s still a $100 increase for a 2 year renewal.&nbsp; Food is more expensive. Etc...&nbsp; And let&#039;s not forget living the American dream of credit card debt (which, yes, is my own doing).<br /><br />I guess I am frustrated because just about everyone I know is feeling like we&#039;re all getting squeezed despite working hard, and doing what we&#039;re &quot;supposed&quot; to be doing to improve our lives and better our standard of living.&nbsp; &nbsp; But it&#039;s only getting harder every year.&nbsp; If things keep going in this direction, I just don&#039;t see how staying in New York is feasible unless I were to live in somewhere like East New York, which I&#039;m just not willing to do because of the commute.&nbsp; I&#039;ve lived in Astoria for 7 years, and feel like I&#039;ve contributed something.&nbsp; But I&#039;m getting squeezed, and pretty much feel a good bit helpless in the situation.&nbsp; I don&#039;t get the impression the Mayor or the city gov&#039;t really cares about making it easier for people to maintain a residence in a city they help support and pay taxes to.<br /><br />Something as seemingly harmless as section 82 really can have a disastrous effect on people for the benefit of landlords.&nbsp; But I haven&#039;t heard of anything being done to change that.<br /><br />Ok, that&#039;s all for now.&nbsp; That&#039;s my rant.&nbsp; Thanks for listening.&nbsp; But I&#039;d like to hear other stories.&nbsp; I find it interesting, and I take solice in knowing I&#039;m not alone.<br /><br />And for reference, here&#039;s Chapter 82:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Chapter 82 of the Law of 2003 amended the Emergency Tenant Protection Act and the NYC Rent Stabilization Code to provide that:<br /><br />where the amount of rent charged to and paid by<br />the tenant is less than the legal regulated rent for<br />the housing accommodation, the amount of rent<br />for such housing accommodation which may be<br />charged upon renewal or upon vacancy thereof<br />may, at the option of the owner, be based upon<br />such previously established legal regulated rent,<br />as adjusted by the most recent applicable guidelines<br />increases and other increases authorized by law...<br />Chapter 82 of the Laws of 2003, §§ 3, 6.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></div>

I still would not want to trade places there. <br /><br />One suggestion in links that was interesting is that the high compensation in bonuses is a sign of economic weakness.

What is the argument against bonuses?<br /><br /><br />Perhaps a tangent, I also would hope that NYC would become less reliant on Wall Street as a dominant engine. May it do very well. But I would like to see other areas of NYC expand too.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_109911">Excellent articles Lanseaux, however, judging from the content of the articles, aside from the specialty real estate markets, I do not think much of a case was made for a causation between bonuses and real estate.&nbsp; I am inclined to agree with Sweeper on this one.&nbsp; As the OP&#039;s original article noted, the lion&#039;s share of bonuses went to a small minority and their bonuses would not all of a sudden put them in the Astorian housing market.&nbsp; And the couple of hundred dollar bonuses that went to the foot soldiers would not put anyone into a higher housing class.&nbsp; The free hand of the housing market is just too big to be affected by such bonuses.&nbsp; Its the millions of little economic transactions that make the difference, not the few sexy media ones.<br /><br />I did not see the OP&#039;s post as neither a hope that some would be less fortunate nor specifically for an appeal for affordable, quality housing (though I&#039;m sure the OP, like all of us, are interested in such).&nbsp; It seemed to me a like a bit of envy on those who who are getting the bonuses and frustration with the paradox that these companies are losing money, yet bonuses are still being handed out.&nbsp; I&#039;m not in the Wall Street crowd, but I do know that the bonus system can be complicated at times.<br /><br />Over the past seven years, New York and Astoria in specific has become a hot place to live.&nbsp; It would make sense that housing costs would outpace inflation.&nbsp; I&#039;m not quite sure what can be done about it other then just facing the reality that living in Astoria is becoming a luxury.&nbsp; That&#039;s not the fault of the fat cats.</div>

One third of the City’s homeowners earn more than $100,000 per year, compared to only 22 percent at the national level. This does not reflect the income distribution for all New York households, since only 17 percent of all households earn more than $100,000 a year. The data suggest that homeownership in New York City is less of a middle-class reality than in the rest of the country.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Housing Price Appreciation and Income Trends<br />Home prices in New York City have escalated rapidly in recent years, with the average real annual appreciation rate between 2000 and 2005 exceeding 10 percent, more than three times the City’s annual average of 3 percent in the 25 years prior to 2000. Today, home prices for all housing types in New York City have reached record highs, with a median sale price of $480,000 citywide in 2005, up from $285,805 in 2000; after adjusting for inflation, this represents a 68 percent increase in only five years.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So how does this fit with income and bonuses?&nbsp; This is really going beyond what I have the time to look into, but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s out of line to draw <em><strong>a</strong></em> connection between the huge bonuses and soaring real estate prices in NYC.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.economicmobility.org/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">The Economic Mobility Project</a>, a &quot;nonpartisan collaboration of The Pew Charitable Trusts and respected thinkers from four leading policy institutes — The American Enterprise Institute, The Brookings Institution, The Heritage Foundation and The Urban Institute&quot; has extensive information on income and economic mobility.&nbsp; Median family (numbers taken from people in their 30&#039;s) income grew by 9% between 1974 and 2004, only because women&#039;s wages increased, although they still make less than men.&nbsp; Men&#039;s wages fell 12% over the same period.<br /><br />That is across the board.&nbsp; But according to the <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">Congressional Budget office</a>, the after-tax income of the top 1 percent rose 228 percent from 1979 through 2005 (see <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/22/opinion/22herbert.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">this Bob Herbert column</a>).&nbsp; After-tax income of the top 3% was $369,800, and the top 1% was $1,071,500 in 2005 (from <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/88xx/doc8885/12-11-HistoricalTaxRates.pdf" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">this CBO report</a> [PDF].&nbsp; According to the <a href="http://www.osc.state.ny.us/osdc/rpt5-2008.pdf" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">New York State Comptroller&#039;s Office</a> [PDF], &quot;The average salary on Wall Street surged by 17 percent in 2006 to a record $339,910. The average salary in the rest of the City’s economy grew by only 5 percent to $59,530.&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;ve also found indications of some tantalizing indirect links that focus not on the direct impact of such bonuses, but rather on the bonuses as a symptom of the risky investing and lending structures that led the large financial institutions to post record-breaking profits that were spurred in part by the hot housing market and what has become the subprime lending debacle.&nbsp; See <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120053371948296235.html?mod=googlenews_wsj" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">this recent article</a> from the Wall Street Journal.&nbsp; I&#039;m finding this very interesting, but I just don&#039;t have the time right now to investigate further.</div>

I think part of the reason home prices here have gone up is because many homeowners have renovated/remodeled their homes. This causes the values to increase, along with property taxes - not only for the improved homes, but also of neighboring homes!</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_110300">I think the OP was right, though.&nbsp; This explosive growth in RE has happened EVERYWHERE.&nbsp; I can&#039;t find it now, but I remember running across a NYT article about a co-op complex near 51st street of the E (I think) that was written back in 1997.&nbsp; They were talking about how you the area was becoming more popular, yet you could still get a studio co-op for $20,000.&nbsp; So, curious, I went looking for craigslist ads for something similar and, lo and behold, I saw a studio for sale in the same building.&nbsp; Except, in 2007, they wanted $130k for a studio that needed a renovation.<br /><br />Now, I understand that RE is going to go up.&nbsp; But, seriously, have salaries gone up 6+ times in the last 10 years?&nbsp; For most, they definitely haven&#039;t.&nbsp; It used to be possible for the average person to live in this city, even in Manhattan.&nbsp; <br /><br />There was a similar article in the Queens Gazette from 2000 talking about Pistilli Riverview.&nbsp; Here is a direct quote from the article: &quot;Apartments will range from studios to three-bedroom units. Prices for the co-ops would range from about $90,000 to $275,000. Pistilli said he hoped monthly maintenance fees would&quot; be kept low.&quot;&quot;&nbsp; The prices are nowhere near that and, well, the maintenance fees aren&#039;t low.<br /><a href="http://www.qgazette.com/News/2000/0927/Front_page.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.qgazette.com/News/2000/0927/Front_page.html</a> (the article, for your pleasure)<br /><br />What&#039;s driven these exploding RE prices?&nbsp; People buying homes they can&#039;t afford, far-too-easy loans for everyone, predatory lending practices, and record Wall Street profits that were, oddly enough, made in a large part of selling and packaging these same shoddy loans.<br /><br />This scramble to turn every American into a homebuyer and to make record profits blew most real estate values up astronomically.&nbsp; However, more than that is blowing up.&nbsp; It&#039;s time to pay the piper.<br /><br />As someone else already posted here; everything is in a cycle.&nbsp; Now is the downturn.&nbsp; Easy loans have dried up; big Wall Street banks, all banks, pretty much are posting huge losses; housing values are declining (how many bidding wars and homes selling above asking price have you seen lately?); people are starting to feel the strain of increased prices in food, fuel, and utilities; and layoffs are starting to increase.&nbsp; <br /><br />IMHO, we&#039;re up for a downturn over the next year or two; possibly a very serious one.&nbsp; It&#039;s just my inexpert opinion, of course, but we could very well be setting up for a serious contraction that could bring things back to rational levels.&nbsp; It won&#039;t be pretty; jobs will be lost, and people will be struggling.<br /><br />SOMETHING has to change.&nbsp; The fact that housing has become all but unaffordable for a generation that&#039;s just entering or has only been in the workforce for a few years is unprecedented.&nbsp; But, we&#039;re such a debt-laden society, we&#039;ve been able to survive...barely.<br /><br />I think an entire shift in the way that people look at debt and spending has to change.&nbsp; Never before have we, as a society in general, been so materialistic or irrational about costs.&nbsp; <br /><br />In my opinion, we&#039;re about to be humbled and tested.&nbsp; It&#039;s just my opinion and, hey, I could just be very pessimistic about it.&nbsp; But, that pessimism has helped me reign in my spending and learn to live better within my (pretty meager) means, as well as put away what money I can.&nbsp; If we hit a serious recession; look out.&nbsp; It&#039;ll be rough.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_110320">Incomes based on market competition are inherently moral. People should be paid no more and no less than what other people are willing to pay them. No coercion, no minimums, no maximums. A person has skills or knowledge or something to offer that an employer values at $2 an hour or $20,000 an hour, they consent to work together, everybody wins.&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />Problems arise when incomes are derived independently of a market process. One obvious example, of course, is the income of a dictator. Castro&#039;s net worth is estimated conservatively at one billion dollars. Did he acquire this wealth through a voluntary exchange of values where the other parties had the right NOT to be obliged to compensate him? Ummm, no. He&#039;s able to capture wealth by paying a gang of thugs to systematically oppress people and expropriate their wealth at will. Disgusting. :-P&nbsp; <br /><br />Minimum wage laws distort labor markets by creating an arbitrary floor for wages. The opportunity cost of minimum wage laws are the jobs that are not legally allowed to exist. Which really sucks for extremely low-skilled workers. On the flipside, since the 1980s, there has been a proliferation of anti-hostile takeover legislation at the state legislature level. States are basically competing to offer legal structures that are enticing to businesses. One tragic effect of creating artificial legal barriers to takeover challenges is that corporations become artificially insulated from the competitive culture that is supposed to drive them to innovate, be more productive, more cost-conscious. When there are no repercussions for running a business badly, you get corporate executive boards giving themselves raises/compensation packages that are truly inappropriate. Of course, the problem here is not the amount of any given CEO&#039;s compensation, it&#039;s the incentives created by anti-competitive legislation to &quot;protect&quot; businesses from competition. You can google &quot;regulatory capture&quot; for an other phenomenon that has unintended consequences along the lines of enriching some businesses by creating artificial barriers to entry in different markets.&nbsp; :x<br /><br />A less obvious example comes in the form of government &quot;protecting&quot; industries by imposing tariffs, for example.&nbsp; This means that a domestic producer is going to be able to charge consumers more than would be possible if foreign producers were able to price their goods/services without paying a government fee. Consumers, in effect, are taxed to subsidize businesses. The tax isn&#039;t obvious because it is embedded in the prices of the limited selection of goods available to people in markets that are &quot;protected&quot; by tariffs.&nbsp; <img src="http://www.astorians.com/community/Smileys/SoLoSMiLeYS1/cry.gif" alt="&#58;cry&#58;" title="cry" class="smiley" /><br /><br />*******<br /><br />Give me a government that enforces laws against coercion and fraud vigorously, but otherwise leaves you and me alone. I have no problem with enormous income gaps. Super wealthy people are able to capitalize the kinds of discoveries and radical breakthroughs in technology that eventually make it possible, for example, for people of all income levels to live longer, healthier, more productive, more enjoyable lives. Would you rather be a 25-year-old king in the 15th century Europe or a 25-year-old making $35,000 a year living in NYC in 2008? Who has a better quality of life and whose future is brighter?<br /><br />Relative to people at the same income level in prior centuries and even decades, people at every income level enjoy a higher quality of life over time in a society that has a vital, free market economy. The problems we&#039;re facing now are proportional to the severity of the increasing role of government in our economy.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_110336">Adam, I agree with most of your post in principle.&nbsp; There are times our free market system will produce seemingly obscene inequities, yet for the most part, it results in a higher general prosperity.&nbsp; Cyclical economic trends are an undenable part of the system, yet its a much better option IMO than command economies.&nbsp; There is a danger, however, of the development of a severe inequity of wealth distribution.&nbsp; This pulls the entire system down and results in economic retardation.&nbsp; The Gracchii brothers recognized this and were killed by the moneyed senate, which was in turn done in by the landless citizens who clamoured for an emperor (aways intrigued by the paralels between Rome and America).<br /><br />So I think there do have to be some safeguards against this.&nbsp; I think the rant against bonuses is just populist frustration and its been going on for quite some time.&nbsp; But its just a rant and the middle classes wouldn&#039;t advoate going any farther than just that, for they are too wrapped up in the system to push for any real changes.&nbsp; On the other hand, the lower classes cannot simply be left to the wiles of a free market.&nbsp; Unlike the middle class, they are always in danger of rejecting the system.&nbsp; Minimum wage laws are not economic ones, but social ones like welfare, free medical insurance and the gross imbalance between the taxes acquired from them and the cost of the government services vouchsafed to them.&nbsp; Really just modern day bread and circuses to prevent them from rioting.&nbsp; <br /><br />I also agree with you on the coercion comments, but we do have this in this country.&nbsp; Its a bit more subtle then Castro-like coercion, but its just as prevelant.&nbsp; Wage slavery, or the institution whereby the poor are left with no other option then working for near sustanence wages, is very strong in this country.&nbsp; The middle and upper classes benefit from this immensly, and its much more economical than straight out slavery.<br /><br />Finally, I agree with the comments on tariffs, however, I do see them as a useful tool in allowing a nascent industry to mature to the point where it can compete on its own.&nbsp; As a permanent policy they are destructive, and the English Corn Laws are examples of the worst of the worst.<br /><br />What I am more curious on is how the development of the two family income over the one family income has affected real estate.&nbsp; It seems that today a two income family finds it just as hard to buy a house than a one income family did 30 years ago.&nbsp; How much has the two family income driven up prices?&nbsp; I have no idea but I&#039;d love to see any study which might touch on it.&nbsp; </div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_110371">Hi Frappe. A few thoughts on your response. <br /><br />I&#039;m not sure what to make of your stated agreement with me &quot;on principle&quot; in light of all of your assertions that contradict my basic principle.<br /><br />I wrote: &quot;Incomes based on market competition are inherently moral. People should be paid no more and no less than what other people are willing to pay them. No coercion, no minimums, no maximums. A person has skills or knowledge or something to offer that an employer values at $2 an hour or $20,000 an hour, they consent to work together, everybody wins.&quot;<br /><br />You have asserted that severe inequality of wealth distribution is dangerous. I disagree, profoundly and on principle, because such an assertion is based on an obsolete understanding of wealth. <br /><br />Wealth is not static. There is not a fixed amount of wealth in the world whereby the only way person A is extraordinarily wealthy is by other persons being poorer. Wealth is created by trade, by exchanges of value that profit both parties. You and I sit down together. I trade you a pen I don&#039;t need in exchange for your magazine that you&#039;ve already read. Instantly, we are both wealthier. Wealth creation is a win-win scenario.<br /><br />Rules and regulations that create artificial obstacles to people trading with other people create problems. The people with the least amount to trade are, generally speaking, people with fewer or undeveloped skills, less marketable knowledge, basically, poor people. What they most frequently do have to trade is their willingness to engage in straightforward manual labor. And many such people strive to come to the U.S. because there is a market for their labor here that doesn&#039;t exist in their home countries.<br /><br />Now, I believe fervently that is evil (truly and unforgiveably evil) to interfere with the ability of these people to trade their labor at market rates. People who are not inclined to think seriously about minimum wage laws in terms of their economic impact will insist that they have the moral high ground when they insist that a price floor for labor be legally enforced. But it shouldn&#039;t take anybody long to figure out what happens when a business is told that it is ILLEGAL to hire people below a certain price. Generally speaking, many jobs that would otherwise be offered never get to exist. Of course, some jobs are offered extralegally, in the form of a black market in labor, but these come with the obvious pitfall that some employers gain leverage/power over such employees that does not exist in the &quot;legal&quot; private sector.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Looking at the history of minimum wage laws reveals some interesting things. Who has incentives to pass laws that make it illegal for people to work below a certain price? Think about it. Who gains an advantage by preventing competition for existing jobs? That&#039;s right, people who are already employed. Like, for example, white men in South Africa during Apartheid, or, men in general in the United States during the so-called progressive era who wanted to forestall competition with women. <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~tleonard/papers/Womenswork.pdf" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.princeton.edu/~tleonard/papers/Womenswork.pdf</a> How ironic that (assuming well-intentioned advocates/legislators) the unintended consequence of minimum wage laws is, in essence, unemployment! Of course, when you think about it, the biggest advocates of minimum wage laws are Democrats, who are also the most influenced by Unions. Hmmm.<br /><br />And yet, while less than 10% of the U.S. labor force is unionized, over 96% of the country is paid more than the minimum wage. How to account for the fact that so many businesses who are not FORCED by government legislation end up paying more than the minimum? It&#039;s simple. There are market rates for labor and, generally speaking, employers have to pay what the market demands to attract qualified workers. Would I pay $2 an hour instead of $20 an hour if I could for my freelance help? Of course. But that&#039;s just not possible because of competition. I can&#039;t attract qualified help for less.<br /><br />&quot;Wage slavery.&quot; To describe paying somebody for the value of their labor so derisively is just difficult for me to process. The implication that a person running a business should pay laborers more than the market will bear strikes me as the worst kind of hypocrisy, since at the other end of the spectrum, high wage earners are regularly disparaged for being paid &quot;too much.&quot;&nbsp; And if paying eighty laborers slightly more leads to the unemployment of 20 laborers, is that worth it? By whose standards? And, by the way, who the hell has any right to make this call other than the person whose capital is creating these jobs? A politician? Really? Because his incentives, we&#039;re to believe, will be pure and just?&nbsp; :roll:<br /><br />***<br /><br />Frappe, I appreciate your thoughtful comments, as usual. Though I&#039;m not convinced that we agree on principle at this point, I have hope!&nbsp; :mrgreen:</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_110524">Lol, I can see the paradox in my post, but I do agree with you in principle.&nbsp; I also find no inherent moral dilemma with incomes based solely on market competition.&nbsp; Where we differ, however, is in the worlds which are operating within.<br /><br />The strict market economic model which you espouse is steeped in a theoretical world, rather similar to the theoretical world in which a strict command economic model would also be sucessful in.&nbsp; Both ignore social realities.&nbsp; So while I concurr with your views on the strict economic ramifications of minimum wage laws (I&#039;m sorry I did not communicate myself well on this, as I saw that four-fifths of your post dealt specifically with such), I can&#039;t agree with your opinion that they are harmful on the balance.&nbsp; Social unrest, labor unrest, crime and physical coercion must not be excluded from the equation.<br /><br />I&#039;m interested to see how my concept of wealth is obsolete.&nbsp; The pen/magazine story has been going on since the Eygptians sent their excess gold down to Canaan for lumber.&nbsp; While I do appreciate the absolutes noted in your previous post (a 15th century king v. 20th century $35,000 salary) and I attempt to personally live my life thankful of such a prosperity we enjoy today, that again ignores the social realities.&nbsp; Wealth is not an absolute, it is a relative and to treat it as an absolute disregards the human condition.&nbsp; How exactly is assertion that a severe inequity in wealth distribution is dangerous is obsolete?<br /><br />I can tell you that throughout history, such thinking has not been oboslete.&nbsp; Severe inequities of wealth distributions are almost always one of the chief components of the downfall of most civilizations.&nbsp; The Greeks in the 3rd century BC, Roman Republic in 2nd century BC, Roman Empire in the 5th AD, Bryzantines (nearly!) in the 7th century, Franks in the 10th Century, Croats in the 11th century, Spanish in 17th, French in 18th, Russians in 20th.&nbsp; The Chinese made something of a sport of it, with a new change in dynasty every two or three hundred years or so.&nbsp; The interesting times are when the moneyed elite become cognizant of this and they redistributed the wealth (without a revolution from below).&nbsp; The Athenians of Solon and the Bzyantine reforms of the 9th century come to mind.&nbsp; In both situations, everyone became more properious, <span class="bbc_u">including</span> the wealthy who redistirbuted their wealth.&nbsp; <br /><br />Finally on wage slavery.&nbsp; Your response to it was again attached to the minumum wage.&nbsp; Wage slavery is based on the premise that money is not simply a tool, it is a form of power and it in itself can be coercive (more so than a Castro-henchman).&nbsp; I&#039;m not saying its upto the individual business owner to solve it, nor that it is even a concious policy which is being pursued, but it exists nonetheless and it represents a danger, as well as a moral stain, to the republic.&nbsp; </div>

Both ignore social realities.<br /><br />Absurd, right? But why? They&#039;re both &quot;just theories,&quot; right?&nbsp; :roll:<br /><br />Economics as a science focuses on studying human action: It is concerned with *what human beings really do*.<br /><br />Economics investigates and examines the costs, motivations, and consequences of human action (including human rules/social structures) given the nature of humans as valuing and acting individuals with certain abilities and limits operating in the context of the natural world and human society. <br /><br />Economics as a science does not tell us what humans should or should not do. The role of an economist vis-a-vis public policy set by politicians is to discover the impact of those policies on people&#039;s lives. <br /><br />There is a centuries old research project (broadly speaking, it&#039;s called classical liberalism) that has developed and continues to refine our economic understandings. It is now understood that prosperity (people living longer lives with more choices and more wealth), not the theory of prosperity, but the real lived phenomenon, arises consistently when individuals are free to seek their own ends, according to their own individuality and awareness of the specifics of their time and place. <br /><br />The failure of central planning to produce prosperity has been observed, its problems perceived, documented, studied, and explained. Your haphazard support of minimum wage laws is, to be blunt, mystical. The real world effect (&quot;social reality&quot;) of minimum wages is that people are fired, jobs that would be created in one place are pushed underground or overseas or simply never get to exist. You speculate about all hell breaking loose (see your next quote) if people are hired at market rates instead of rates set by the government. Your speculation does not correspond to what happens when people contract to work jobs at rates the market will bear.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=9267.msg110524#msg110524">Quote from: Frappe on January 28, 2008, 09:31:16 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">So while I concurr with your views on the strict economic ramifications of minimum wage laws (I&#039;m sorry I did not communicate myself well on this, as I saw that four-fifths of your post dealt specifically with such), I can&#039;t agree with your opinion that they are harmful on the balance.&nbsp; Social unrest, labor unrest, crime and physical coercion must not be excluded from the equation.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So, one question that occurs to me is: By what right does a person tell another person what price he or she can exchange his or her labor for? If you attempted to explain to an unemployed person your speculation that &quot;social unrest, labor unrest, crime, and physical coercion&quot; might be the result of allowing her to contract with an employer for $2.45 an hour, she might wonder aloud about how you know this will happen (news flash, you have no basis for knowing this will happen) before asking you how the hell what she does is any of your business (it really isn&#039;t).&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />You would say that her unemployment helps us to live in a better society. What is her next best option, in your opinion? To leave our society? To take jobs off the books and hope she doesn&#039;t get caught and fined/imprisoned? Maybe you&#039;ll propose that there should be organizations, perhaps the government, that will offer job training so that she qualifies for better paying jobs? That would not change the underlying reality: there are producers who need certain jobs filled that do not require higher levels of knowledge or skill, and there will always be people qualified to take on those jobs who will be denied access to those opportunities because of minimum wage laws.<br /><br />Advocating for a minimum wage is morally and practically untenable. Morally, because no person should have the right to interfere in the relationships other adults form with one another based on mutual consent. And practically because the existence of minimum wage laws only has the effect of driving low-paying jobs underground or overseas, not eliminating them. Like what results from all forms of prohibition, law-abiders are screwed, decent people are made into law-breakers for engaging in behavior that is peaceful and productive, and, of course, a black market will thrive. <br /><br />Minimum wage laws are one of many misguided attempts by a coalition of well-intentioned, arrogant, and manipulative people to design human society. Prosperity is not the outcome of design, no matter how well-intentioned or intelligent. Prosperity is not the point of these laws. Politicians propose minimum wages and then propose raising them for a variety of reasons that all point in the direction of their being re-elected. </div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_110954">But, Communism did not succeed.&nbsp; In the end, people need something to strive for, a reason to excel and achieve above the average/expected level, and that &quot;carrot in front of their noses&quot; to truly be happy.&nbsp; The capitalist system, while flawed in the distribution of wealth, provides a &quot;reason&quot; for the average citizen to strive to better themselves and a goal (wealth) for them to work to achieve.<br /><br />The fatal flaw in capitalism is greed.&nbsp; This flaw is broad and covers quite a bit.&nbsp; First, it hits people in becoming crazed in their push for wealth.&nbsp; Examples of this are Tulip Mania, The South Sea Bubble, the Florida Land Bust, the dot.com, and, now, the real estate bubble.&nbsp; People saw easy money and ignored rational thinking and the inevitable changing of cycles.&nbsp; They figured RE values would continue up and they, armed with easy credit, bid homes to astronomical values.&nbsp; Look at a chart of the Case/Shiller home index (On the 2nd page of this great article: <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/real-estate/article/104341/Housing-Meltdown" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://finance.yahoo.com/real-estate/article/104341/Housing-Meltdown</a>).&nbsp; Starting in 2000, home prices skyrocketed and were only carried further by the average greedy citizen that had NO CLUE about home values; but they were armed with all sorts of stories and 767,865,786 TV shows and books telling and showing them the path to easy millions.<br /><br />The second part of the fatal greed flaw in capitalist society is the reluctance of many of the wealthy to &quot;share&quot; their wealth with those that are less fortunate.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t have to be in the literal sense of handing off their money; but it can also be in the sense of donating to clinics, schools, and youth programs.&nbsp; We don&#039;t place enough importance on this in our society.&nbsp; Perhaps it is greed; perhaps it&#039;s because many wealthy believe that the government should take care of those things with their tax dollars.<br /><br />IMHO, we have to work to find a happy medium.&nbsp; We need capitalism to provide the spark and drive to achieve greatness for so many people.&nbsp; However, we need a little communism to be instilled on the ones that succeed in becoming wealthy.&nbsp; It could be done by giving better tax breaks for donating large portions of money.&nbsp; Or, it could be done by overhauling the current tax code to a fair tax system so those that spend more, truly pay more.<br /><br />In the end though, I don&#039;t think it is a good thing that our government is meddling so much in the stock market.&nbsp; This decline is very needed and, with any hope, will help bring reality and sanity back to the housing markets.&nbsp; If we have a particularly bad recession, sustained flat market (like the 1970s), or even a depression, it could really help to reign in this massive debt and re-instill the importance of SAVING in they younger generations of our society.<br /><br />If the Fed keeps meddling and debt keeps increasing, it will eventually collapse and, if it continues to grow unimpeded, that collapse could be very catastrophic.<br /><br />(P.S. Sorry if this gets a bit rambling; I&#039;m doing 5 things at once and my thoughts are jumping everywhere).</div>

Socialism is (an outrageously well-received) speculative hypothesis. <br /><br />Why is socialism a widely accepted idea? Probably as a result of its free lunch promises (so enticing), its deep reliance on the popular morality of sacrifice (thank you major world religions), its emphasis on nonmaterialistic virtues (starving as transcendence, thanks again religions), its hypocritical but insistent emphasis on the power of reason (central planning is possible, if we treat people like disposable machine parts!), and its play on the psychology of envy and wish-fulfillment (feel taller by kicking wealth people in the shins). <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=9267.msg110926#msg110926">Quote from: Frappe on February 05, 2008, 11:28:44 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">2.&nbsp; Agreed on comments about economics being a science, however, since you are taking it past simple economics and you are clearly advocating a policy change, you are undertaking the role as a politician.&nbsp; So what&#039;s the point of that statement with regards to the discussion?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />One of the rules I&#039;m following is &quot;first do no harm.&quot;&nbsp; My policy change advocacy is based on a harm reduction strategy. Presumably, people don&#039;t elect government officials to create problems, make people&#039;s lives more difficult, increase costs of living, cut off opportunities, cause deprivation or shortages of goods and services, etc.&nbsp; But government officials, through faulty economic policies given the force of law and harsh noncompliance penalties, are hurting people. Let&#039;s make them stop!<br />&nbsp; <br />Coercive wealth transfer laws, like tariffs and minimum wages, harm people. The harm is direct (jobs disappear) and indirect (opportunity costs, the wealth and/or options that would have been created, but now won&#039;t be).&nbsp; Now pointing that out and calling for the repeal of those laws is the next logical step. Politicians created these problems, and prodded by an (eventually, sooner-rather-than-later please!) educated and infuriated electorate, they have to clean them up. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=9267.msg110926#msg110926">Quote from: Frappe on February 05, 2008, 11:28:44 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">3.&nbsp; Classical Liberalism stems from humanism, which is the thought that humans are rational beings and that they shall make good, rational decisions if given the opportunity and access to information.&nbsp; From this, two distinct strains of though developed:&nbsp; The first is very similar to your opinion:&nbsp; Leave people alone as much as possible and on the <span class="bbc_u">macro</span> level, people will make the right choices (Classical Liberalism).&nbsp; The second strain sees humanity as an interacting unit rather than dispersed individuals:&nbsp; It is within the power of humans to conjure a world in which they can use their rational and intellegence to benefit their society on a <span class="bbc_u">macro</span> level (i.e. social welfare laws). </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>&nbsp; <br /><br />In the U.S., a strange propaganda war against socialism targeted the word liberalism, which is now a word cut off from its actual, derived meaning, which led partly to the birth of the unwieldy word &#039;libertarianism.&#039; I prefer liberalism, but it&#039;s only by qualifying it as &quot;classical&quot; that people clearly understand that one doesn&#039;t mean socialism, which, again, is ridiculous, but c&#039;est la vie. <br /><br />There&#039;s liberalism, which recognizes the individual and his/her liberty as the moral basis for human society, and there&#039;s socialism, which subordinates individual liberty to the so-called good of society. Liberalism versus Socialism, liberty versus society. Does society exist to serve the individual or do individuals exist to serve society? <br /><br />Classical liberalism does not view individuals as &quot;dispersed.&quot; Pure bullpoop. It recognizes individuals as what they are: acting, valuing, unique egos, with their own particulars of space and time, their own perspectives based on their individuality, experiences, culture, environment.&nbsp; Liberalism recognizes the fundamental right of every individual to operate according to his or her own goals, thoughts, preferences, and priorities. This means that when individuals interact with one another, there must be mutual respect for this basic right. Ergo, all relationships are based on mutual consent. But there are relationships, Frappe. Dispersed? What a silly notion. Have you ever read Adam Smith&#039;s scientific observations of people of all different cultures interacting? Liberalism recognizes the right a person to live outside of society, but it is based on the proper basis for relationships between people as they naturally emerge.&nbsp; <br /><br />Liberal relationships are voluntary; socialist relationships are involuntary. It&#039;s that simple. Liberal societies require governments that uphold each individual&#039;s liberty. Socialist societies require that each individual serve the needs of every other individual.<br /><br />The U.S. is swinging hard in the direction of socialism. For example, Hillary isn&#039;t inhibited by the notion that voluntary consent is the core value of a free society. She&#039;s psyched about mandating... that&#039;s her b.s. word, but really, she&#039;s brazenly motivated to FORCE people to behave the way she needs them to for her health care system to work. She has a vision for a new America, she&#039;s stated over and over, explicitly, that her vision is going to require sacrifice, that her changes won&#039;t be easy or popular, but she believes we&#039;re all up to the challenge.... of being FORCED by her.... to make America better.&nbsp; This is no different from the &quot;change&quot; that Obama promises, by the way. But I still prefer him to her.&nbsp; <br /><br />Wasn&#039;t America founded on the idea that governments must be subordinate to individual liberty? Isn&#039;t that what makes our country so different from the rest of the world? Isn&#039;t that why they come here? <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=9267.msg110926#msg110926">Quote from: Frappe on February 05, 2008, 11:28:44 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> This is called New Liberalism.&nbsp; The superiority of one over the other is not &quot;understood&quot; nor self-evident.&nbsp; But thanks for the cute tip on the centuries old research project.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />&quot;New Liberalism?&quot; That&#039;s ridiculous.

But if this isn&#039;t self-evident to you, that&#039;s okay.

How exactly is assertion that a severe inequity in wealth distribution is dangerous is obsolete?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> <br /><br />One night, a comedian makes ten people laugh at a price of $10 a head. A few months later, she makes 1000 people laugh at a price of $30. A few years later she makes an advertising deal that compensates her $500,000 to promote soap, and is netting $50,000 a month from live performances. She starts selling recordings of her performances and her monthly income skyrockets to $300,000. She starts a chain of restaurants and makes even more money. Say she&#039;s making $10 million a year. $100 million a year. $1 billion a year. $1000 billion a year. When exactly does this every become a problem for anyone? As long as all of the transactions are based on mutual consent between adults, I don&#039;t sense a problem. Do you? <br /><br />If instead of money, she were simply having an ever greater amount of great sex, would you have a problem with that?<br /><br />How much profit is too much profit is a question that assumes if person A is making big bucks, it&#039;s somehow got to be at the involuntary expense of many other people. Well, there surely are examples of this. Castro&#039;s wealth is blood-drenched. But what about the comedian above? She&#039;s laughing all the way to the bank because people value her product. No harm, no foul. Right? <br /><br />It&#039;s okay to agree with this, despite your intuition that there&#039;s something amiss. Just because something is counterintuitive doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s not the case. The evolution of the human mind over the course of about one hundred thousand years living as hunters-gatherers certainly increases the likelihood that some of us will naturally feel averse to wealth inequality. Hunters-gatherers were used to living in what game theorists call a zero-sum gain context. There were only so many berries collected, only so much meat. When George the hunter ate more meat than usual, it almost certainly meant that somebody else was eating less meat than usual. But that all changed with our transition to an economy based on producers-consumers. If you plot the progress that human beings have made in the last millennium against the progress made during the first 99,000 years of human civilization, you&#039;ll find that human beings AT EVERY INCOME LEVEL are benefiting tremendously from startling improvements in health, longevity, technology, and quality of life made possible by the emergence of ever more sophisticated and inclusive markets for more advanced and more accessible goods and services. <br /><br />***<br /><br />Wealth inequality is a boon to human society. Why? <br /><br />Scientific discovery, technological innovation, the development of advanced manufacturing/distribution/transportation techniques... developing all of this progress involves a continuum of highly risky, speculative, costly endeavors.&nbsp; The existence of super wealthy people represents a target market for novel inventions, for prototypes of goods and services that are, at least initially, extremely expensive to produce. The absence of such people would represent (1) the absence of an incentive for people to risk capital on the development of cutting edge breakthroughs and (2) the absence of a market-based PROFIT AND LOSS feedback loop for these highly risky projects. Profit and Loss are the ways in which capitalists learn when to launch/discontinue one project or how to make products more useful and appealing to potential investors/customers/consumers.&nbsp; &nbsp;:mrgreen:<br /><br />(Actually, all of us make profit/loss decisions every day. You put less energy/time/wealth into relationships, professional endeavors, career choices, romantic involvements&nbsp; (etc.) with lower rates of return than alternatives. You put more energy/time/wealth into relationships with higher rates of return, so on and so forth. There is no way to operate outside of a profit and loss context. We are always using finite resources in finite contexts with results that can be measured against better or worse possible outcomes. Generally, we try to make the most of what we&#039;ve got, or, in other words, to use what we have as profitably as possible.) <br /><br />Automobile, electric power, medical (therapeutic and diagnostic), home theater, and computer technologies are all examples of innovations that were first enjoyed only by a precious few wealthy people. Plasma tvs that now cost under $1000 once cost a minimum of $70,000. Cell phones used to be huge and cost tens of thousands of dollars, now they&#039;re tiny and included with sub $30/month subscription plans. It must be noted that although wealth made it possible for a first wave of entrepreneurs to offer products based on these technologies, terrific levels of wealth only accrued to the subset of these entrepreneurs who were able to produce and sell products/services profitably to the masses, not merely to niche markets.&nbsp; <img src="http://www.astorians.com/community/Smileys/SoLoSMiLeYS1/wink.gif" alt="&#58;wink&#58;" title="wink" class="smiley" />&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />Think about that for a moment. <br /><br />It is a comforting thought to imagine a world filled with people who are trying to develop products and services that you and I would benefit from using at a price you and I can afford. If those people become phenomenally wealthy, it means that a huge number of people valued their products MORE than what they paid for them. We all benefit from entrepreneurs&#039; risk-taking, intelligence, insights, and competence, and they benefit from our choice to use their product instead of their competitors&#039;. Raise your hand if you have a complaint about this. No hands? Great!&nbsp; :D<br /><br />I will offer only this qualification: From each according to his/her freely made decision to pay a price, to each according to his/her ability to create/offer things that people value is the moral formulation of wealth creation. Tragically, there are people in this world who have captured wealth by force, by actually stealing it physically or through systematic expropriation, or through profane alliances of corporations with governments (fascism).&nbsp; There are also people who attempt to bribe politicians to pass laws that create artificial advantages for some at the expense of others. That&#039;s horrible, too. All of this coercive b.s. is obviously horrific and not at all what I&#039;m describing when I celebrate wealth inequality. :x<br /><br />The best part of wealth inequality, by far, is that it speeds up the discovery and deployment of life-extending and life-enhancing goods and services. :mrgreen:</div>

While this recent book &quot;Who Really Cares,&quot; focuses on religious and nonreligious, it also finds an interesting distinction. To quote from a report 20/20 did (<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=2682730" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=2682730</a>):<br /><br />Arthur Brooks, the author of &quot;Who Really Cares,&quot; says that &quot;when you look at the data, it turns out the conservatives give about 30 percent more.&quot; He adds, &quot;And incidentally, conservative-headed families make slightly less money.&quot; And he says the differences in giving goes beyond money, pointing out that conservatives are 18 percent more likely to donate blood. He says this difference is not about politics, but about the different way conservatives and liberals view government. <br /><br />&quot;You find that people who believe it&#039;s the government&#039;s job to make incomes more equal, <span class="bbc_u">are far less likely to give</span> their money away,&quot; Brooks says. In fact, people who <span class="bbc_u">disagree</span> with the statement, &quot;The government has a basic responsibility to take care of the people who can&#039;t take care of themselves,&quot; are <span class="bbc_u">27 percent more likely</span> to give to charity.<br /></div>

Wealth inequality itself isn&#039;t problematic. It&#039;s not a cause, it&#039;s a consequence. A consequence of what? Human action of one sort or another. <br /><br />Wealth inequality that results from voluntary, peaceful human action, principally trade based on mutual consent, is a great thing. There is no moral justification for a violent response to this kind of wealth creation. There is no moral justification for legally or otherwise outflanking the consent of a property owner in an attempt to acquire his or her wealth. <br /><br />On the other hand, wealth inequality that results from stealing, or from a government&#039;s coercive expropriation, or from legal systems that make it impossible for people to benefit from trading (slavery), or from no-bid contracts awarded based on political pull... basically, any wealth transfer that involves the use or threat of coercion or fraudulent acts... is morally unjustifiable. <br /><br />The French didn&#039;t rebel against Louis XIV because of his wealth. They rebelled because his wealth WAS THEIRS. He didn&#039;t earn it. He took it from them, by force, arbitrarily. France was basically lawless. Local politicians didn&#039;t protect people&#039;s property rights, they abused them! That was the problem. If Louis the XIV had gained his wealth by selling people recordings of his stand-up routine, they wouldn&#039;t have stormed the castle.&nbsp; <br /><br />So, when Apple creates the iPod, it&#039;s a win-win deal for Apple and everybody who buys one.<br />But when Bill Clinton facilitates business deals that enrich brutal dictators and himself on the backs of oppressed people, there are reasons to object. Not because of the wealth inequality itself but because what is happening is not mutually beneficial trade but rather an involuntary wealth transfer. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/31/us/politics/31donor.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/31/us/politics/31donor.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin</a><br />Same goes for Bush&#039;s no-bid contracts to Blackstone to reconstruct Iraq/cater the troop bases, etc. <br /><br />I hope my position is now clear.<br /><br />Love always,<br />Adam<br /></div>

What exactly would you like me to clarify? <br /><br />For the record, I simply never said that New Liberalism was an invention of Clinton or Roosevelt. I don&#039;t think anything I said even suggests that.<br /><br />Yes, the ideas underlying the Progressive Era in the U.S (typically considered to be from about 1890 through the 1920s, though many agree that Roosevelt&#039;s New Deal represented a climactic expression of Progressive Era thinking) took shape during the Enlightenment Period, which itself was ignited by a re-discovery of the ideas of Aristotle and Plato and other philosophers of antiquity. Certainly Rousseau would be considered an intellectual forefather of the progressive era. His views on the important of state-controlled education certainly influenced Dewey. And his notions of freeing individuals from their own self-interests by teaching them from an early age to adopt as their own the general will of society certainly were part of the intellectual assault on liberalism that characterized the Progressive Era. <br /><br />The Enlightenment&#039;s extreme reaction against mysticism would also lead, ironically, to an exaggerated sense of the power of human reason. That was great insofar as it inspired many to seek ever deeper and more sophisticated understandings of human nature and the natural world, and also tragically misguided insofar as it would inspire some to believe that societies might be improved by expert thinkers from above. <br /><br />New Liberalism is ridiculous to me because the &quot;new&quot; stuff is all about undermining the &quot;liberal&quot; stuff. What exactly is so new about that? Most of the history of humanity is about some human beings holding power over others for no other reason than their own enrichment. Frankly, the warlords who sacked and pillaged never told the people they were plundering that it was for their own good. That was a socialist innovation.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I know that many of the Progressive Era proponents of &quot;positive rights&quot; did not believe that their proposals posed problems to individual liberty. But they were wrong. Liberty rights are logically incompatible with rights that impose obligations on some at the involuntary expense of others. Once that contradiction is overlooked and laws begin to encroach on liberty, the results are ultimately dismal. <br /><br />I know that intellectuals inspired by scientific breakthroughs were probably quite well-intentioned when they recommended putting experts in charge of the economy. But they were wrong, too. They mistakenly believed that their successful mastering of the mechanism of nature would translate into improving human society. Hence, during the Progressive Era, there&#039;s a great deal of jabber about &quot;fine-tuning&quot; human values, about individuals as &quot;instruments&quot; through which society improves, et cetera. Some people objected that human beings were not &quot;means to ends&quot;, but the whole &quot;individuals as ends in themselves&quot; crowd was written off as regurgitating &quot;old-school&quot; thinking. Classical liberalism was on its way out.<br /><br />So socialist ideas were increasingly in vogue at the beginning of the 20th century. I will grant that many (possibly most) advocates of positive rights and central planning back then were well-intentioned. If they could have known what the consequences of their ideas would end up being, I bet they would not have pursued their agenda of diminishing individual liberty and increasing the role of government in the economy.<br /><br />But a great deal has happened since then. <a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/</a>&nbsp; We simply no longer have any excuse to trust government to serve our interests better than we can. There&#039;s no longer a reasonable basis for believing that idea.<br /><br />We&#039;ve learned from experience that central planning fails, that its unintended consequences are profoundly harmful and even lethal. Intellectuals have developed theories that accurately describe the problems with central planning. Public choice theorists, Austrian economists, experimental economists (see Vernon Smith). There is an overwhelming data set bolstering the case for more individual freedom and less government interference. <br /><br />The tragedy of the commons (how the absence of prices leads to shortages, abuse, and violence). The knowledge problem (the impossibility of central planners accounting for human individuality and contextual dynamics in a complex society). Unintended Consequences (there are costs and opportunity costs and unexpected costs with government interventions). Greed in the Public Sector (the keen observation that government employees are human beings just like the rest of us, but that the incentive structures at work within public institutions cause inefficiency and vice). Spontaneous Order (like Evolution, how social complexity arises from simplicity over time, not by design but as a result of human action).&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />So, to all Democrats and Republicans excited about intelligently designing human society, I say this:<br /><br />GIVEN what we&#039;ve learned about what happens when the most well-intentioned government interferes coercively with the freedom of individuals to make choices, respond to incentives, adapt to their conditions, trade with one another, relocate themselves and pursue their own goals; <br /><br />IF you care about poverty, if you care about starvation, if you care about the quality of education and health care, if you care about longevity and quality of life, if you care about discovery and innovation, if you care about prosperity; <br /><br />THEN you have to become a bleeding heart advocate for human liberty and against state power. <br /><br />You think there is something &quot;extremely debatable&quot; about this position? Bring it on. :mrgreen:<br /><br />Love always,<br />Adam&nbsp; :-)</div>

Based on the few historical precedents you mentioned earlier, you are ascribing to the quite narrow view of economic determinism:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I can tell you that throughout history, such thinking has not been oboslete.&nbsp; <strong>Severe inequities of wealth distributions are almost always one of the chief components of the downfall of most civilizations.</strong>&nbsp; The Greeks in the 3rd century BC, Roman Republic in 2nd century BC, Roman Empire in the 5th AD, Bryzantines (nearly!) in the 7th century, Franks in the 10th Century, Croats in the 11th century, Spanish in 17th, French in 18th, Russians in 20th. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />And even in that statement I emphasized, you&#039;re being equivocal. But let&#039;s look briefly at the facts:<br /><br />- In Greece and Rome, wealth inequality existed long before other conditions arose (namely warfare, population shifts and political upheaval) that precipitated their respective downfalls. Especially in Rome, massive influx of non-Romans, whether refugees or invaders, simply overwhelmed the state&#039;s ability to maintain civil order.<br /><br />- Byzantium found itself in a religious war with Muslim Arabs, and among themselves over doctrinal Christianity.<br /><br />- The Frankish kingdom did not die out in the 10th century. What they had was the equivalent of a regime change, replacing one leading clan (the Carolingians) with another (the Capetians), leading to the creation of France. Even so, Hugh Capet was elected ruler of France -- he didn&#039;t take the throne by force.<br /><br />- Croatia essentially got its assed kicked by a stronger, more aggressive and expansionist Hungarian kingdom.<br /><br />- Spain was also embroiled in conflict: Protestant reformation, nascent nationalism in the Low Countries, ongoing wars with England and Ottoman Turkey in the Mediterranean. Even so, you can&#039;t say that Spain &quot;fell&quot; at this time -- its Empire lasted for another 200 years.<br /><br />- In Russia, wealth inequality was actually <em>mitigated</em> by the end of the 19th century. War exhaustion, made worse by increased repression and a homegrown militant insurgency killed the Tsar and his ministers.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_111569">Little spurts on each one and we can go into greater detail of any one of them.<br /><br />The democracy and power of the greek cities rested on its citizens.&nbsp; These citizens had enough wealth to purchase their own arms and their want to defend their state.&nbsp; Greek cities become impotent as they lost their relative wealth distributions, and less and less citizens were able to be in the army.&nbsp; Sparta was never really conquered, it just faded away as it found itself unable to defend itself anymore, as there were fewer citizens able to fight.&nbsp; <br /><br />The roman republic also fielded armies made up of citizens who purchased their own arms.&nbsp; As the wealth inequities grew, less Roman citizens were able to (or wanted to) defend the state.&nbsp; This necessitated the Marian reforms.&nbsp; Armies were now professional armies loyal to generals and the republic fell soon thereafter (The whole of Roman history upto the reforms were based on this).&nbsp; The Roman Empire continued on of course, but the republic was done.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire both had huge populations but could not fill those armies with citizen recruits.&nbsp; They increasingly had to rely on barbarian, mercendaries and conscripts, none of whom particularly cared about the state as a whole.&nbsp; This is especially true with the arabs being able to conquer the severely demoralized Egyptian garrisons.&nbsp; In the 10th century, the Byzantines recognized this and specifically redistributed wealth to recreate the citizen army.&nbsp; And it worked for a couple of centuries until Manizkert.<br /><br />The armies of Charlemagne shrunk in size as the frankish nobility kept taking advantage of the warring between the states created after Verdun to increase their own power.&nbsp; The disparity in wealth distribution caused the clannish army which originally gave strength to the franks (and goths, vandals, et cetera).&nbsp; They were replaced by a smaller army of nobles, who could not keep the empire together nor fight off the Vikings.<br /><br />The Croats also lost its citizen armies as the nobility pushed feudalism on the nation.&nbsp; The citizen became a serf and no longer had the means or inclination to fight and they got their butts kicked by the hungarians.<br /><br />Spain didn&#039;t fall, but it was well in decline by the 1600&#039;s.&nbsp; The gold they brought in from the Americas was a retardant on their industry and towns, which are two things which bring about a middle class.&nbsp; These did develop in their competitors, which brought strength and prosperity to eclipse the Spanish.&nbsp; A poor peasantry existed here (and in Portugal) longer than anywhere else in Western Europe.<br /><br />There was income mitigation in Russia, but it was far too late and moved way too slowly for Russia to keep up.&nbsp; It had appalling wealth inequities in 1917 (this has to be looked at in a relative manner).&nbsp; Industry did not develop nor did a middle class, especially in comparison to the rest of Europe.&nbsp; The homegrown military insurgency was in part because of the wealth inequities and the lack of a stake people had in the government.<br /><br />I am a big fan of economic determinism.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure how that is unobjective view of history.<br /><br /></div>
