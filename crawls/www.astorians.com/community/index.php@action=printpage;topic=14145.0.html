				“3Penny Youth”&nbsp; &quot;Mias Pentaras Neiata&quot;<br />is one of the best Modern Greek comedies ever written. Funny dialogue, hysterical transformations, unexpected situations and innocent truth are some of the brilliant and unique components of this great play, that has been a wild success as much on stage as on film and during the Golden Era of the Greek Cinema.<br /><br />Summary of the play:<br />A poor, newly wed, couple, Irene and George, are struggling to build their own house with a loan. George’s salary is not enough, but he’s so jealous and “traditional” in some respect, that he does not let his wife work and help him financially. Under totally unforeseen circumstances, Irene finds herself hired as a secretary to the owner of the business her husband works in, as she is presumed single; the flirtatious young boss has a special preference to single women. From that point on, Irene stands in the middle of a “Don Juan” boss, an “Othello” husband and a constructor that threatens to take their house if they do not pay their installments. A series of hilarious misunderstandings and unexpected developments take place until, in the end, everything clears and all characters get their own lesson in life.<br /><br />The characters are easily recognizable among the Greeks. They work hard to provide for their families, in pursue of a happy life, while under the pressure of responsibilities and needs like that of housing, employment, family and love they step onto each other’s toes, releasing an incredible humor and a kindness of heart.<br /><br />The production of “3Penny Youth” is a result of a strong, collaborative ensemble of ten professional actors. The music is a vital part of the show and is composed by the virtuoso bouzouki player and composer, George Zampetas. There will be a surprising combination of live performances and projected black and white footage with music. Where there are no more words, music takes over and music is part of the Greek tradition and particularly the Greek soul.<br />The actors in order of appearance are:<br />Manos Pantelidis<br />as<br />George Stratakis,<br />Anthoula Katsimatides<br />as<br />Irene Stratakis<br />Martha Tompoulidou<br />as<br />Marika<br />Diodoros Pagoudis<br />as<br />Antreas Alafouzos<br />John Kallianiotis<br />as<br />Paraskevas Tegoulas<br />Stephanos Stephanou<br />as<br />Pashalis Avramidis<br />Antonis Armeftis<br />as<br />Savas,<br />Sokratis Kermetzis<br />&amp; Doctor<br />Eva Galani<br />as<br />Poly Damaskou<br />Theodora Loukas<br />as<br />Sophie Hristaki<br />&amp; Rika<br />Alkis Sarantinos<br />as<br />Dimitris Damaskos<br /><br /><br />Host:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Archdiocesan Hellenic Center<br />Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Music/Arts - Performance<br /><br />Start Time:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friday, February 13, 2009 at 8:00pm<br />End Time:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunday, March 22, 2009 at 8:00pm<br />Fridays &amp; Saturdays at 8:00pm<br />Sundays at 7pm<br /><br />Location:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Astoria, NY<br />Street:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;27-09 Cresent Str<br />City/Town:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Astoria, NY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Phone:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />7186265111<br />
