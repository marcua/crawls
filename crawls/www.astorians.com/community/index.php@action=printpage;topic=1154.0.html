				We are not only marching to commemorate Rosa Parks as she existed in the past but also for the very same issues that still exist in the present (which have never been satisfactorily resolved). We are marching to try and promote change Now. I am sure that it is no one's intention to co-opt a day in the calendar that rightlfully belongs to the victims of AIDS. If I remember correctly one of the points of the protest is to promote healthcare as opposed to yet more military spending. What about the ignorance and fear surrounding the victims of AIDS. What about the prejudice surrounding gay/lesbian/transgender individuals? Are you afraid that people cannot think of two or even five issues at the same time?<br /><br />I see no conflict.<br /><br />&nbsp;I don't mean to be acerbic but I am very disheartened at the schismatism of the Left when we would be better off joining together instead of bickering over semantics when the &quot;collective rug&quot; is being swept from under our feet.

				this sounds like more of a political protest <br /><br />rather than a remembrance of Rosa Parks. <br />that's why i posted up. <br /><br />it's one thing to protest the injustices happening in our country. it's another thing to say it's in remembrance of Rosa Parks. be mindful of this. <br /><br />and i'd rather there be protests with a more concrete purpose, with more effectiveness than a march down on wall street.

				Do you really think that Rosa Parks would mind? Was Rosa in fact apolitical?<br /><br />To demand:<br />1. Justice for Katrina evacuees (iow the elderly and for the most part African Americans) --Poll Would R.P. Agree/Disagree?<br />2. Jobs at a living wage (How political is this? &amp; Poll Would R.P. Agree/Disagree?)<br />3. Military recruiters out of our schools (iow mostly poor kids looking for away out of poverty... iow mostly &quot;depressed neighborhoods&quot; Poll Would R.P. Agree/Disagree?<br />4. Cut the war budget-NOT healthcare, education, housing, and public transportation (Again, (besides the Warrr) How political is this? &amp; again do you think Rosa would agree or disagree having her name attached to such an event?<br /><br />&quot;sunnysidewoodsidepeace&quot; Is this group actively endorsing any party or candidate? And if they were do you think Rosa would vote Republican? I frankly do not know... but I can guess.<br /><br />http://www.troopsoutnow.org/ Now, I can't really speak for this organization but I do know quite a few members from Veterans for Peace, and I can assure you that they are quite non-partisan when it comes to &quot;politics&quot;. They simply do not like <strong>anyone</strong> that sends men and women (young and old) to unjust wars... which I believe most of them are.<br /><br />Rosa Parks devoted her life to change, both in the social and political/legal spheres. Do you think that people who are going out there and risking their necks... iow actually Doing something, standing up, rather than talk talk talking about things... do you Really believe that they are dishonoring her memory? Perhaps we should just erect a statue to her in the park and maybe even give flowers to a relic or piece of her body and then just forget about the <em>spirit</em> which moved her to do the things she did as well as the same injustices that still exist today. Yes, that sounds far more comfortable and nostalgiac. Or we could go to church and worship the cross rather than the tiresome task of actually imitating Jesus's example as we walk through Life. <br /><br />As I said again, we are continuing her work which remains unfinished (through no fault of her own) and we are following her example. I really fail to see why you are having a problem with this. Wouldn't it be more productive to criticze the real culprits? Act against Draconian laws and deregulatory policies that contribute to global warming... or how about the African nations that are on the verge of another possible genocide, or David Duke? Why all this criticism of activists that are excercising their right to protest? Do you want me to tell them to go home because they are defaming Rosa Parks good name? I will if you ask me to... but I doubt they will listen. Some of these people that you are criticizing have actually worked with Rosa in the past, but I'm sure you know her mind better than they do. Sorry again for sounding bitter, but it seems that every time I post an event on the calendar having to do with politics I get into some tiresome debate, while the topics on astorians.net like PATRIOT Act; Power versus Authority; Political Discussion are left untouched or unexplored.<br /><br />On a personal note I am actually trying to distance myself from political activism because I am feeling pretty hopeless about it... not that I think that what I've been doing is a negative thing. It just seems that our cries are falling on deaf ears. I would rather be making money and devoting myself to my innocuous passions &amp; hobbies. Let's imagine a United States... nay World, where there were no protests for fear of offending someones sensibilties. Is this the kind of world we want; where there is no dissent?<br /><br />And what's so bad about being political anyway? Being political is more than a fashion... it is a way of life; a way of life that is irrestisible to those who hunger for power as well as those for justice (who sometimes cannot sleep at night) and like it or not, we are in the thick of it. Do you know that in some circles &quot;liberal&quot; is considered a dirty word? Did you also realize that in other circles so is the word &quot;conservative&quot;? Labels, labels, labels, pc, not pc, afraid of doing this, afraid of doing that, all of this stifling action and proactive change... political change. And to make a long story short, that is why we're at war and killing people by the thousands; that is why nothing happens when engineers cry out &quot;Fix the dikes before the next category 3 hurricane!&quot;<br />No one is to blame for these atrocities but ourselves who thought it too hard or imrudent to take a stand for fear of offending somebody or being arrested.<br /><br />I see by your profile that you are a social worker and you believe in social justice... so I am tempted to believe that you are just baiting me so that you'll ellicit another one of my entertaining rants.<br /><br />Cabanird's sig.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The penalty good people pay for not being interested in politics is to be governed by people worse than themselves. --Plato<br />Social Workers for Social Justice-- Because Peace is the BEST Shelter!</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Now I Know you are pulling my leg!<br />Is this the case? If it is then I am more flattered than annoyed &nbsp;:P &nbsp;.But if this is not the case, then I must confess that I am a bit puzzled :?:<br /><br />In any case (even though I am Agnostic) God (or Goddess) go with you and keep up the good work.<br /><br />Your puzzled friend,<br />-Zero

It just seems that our cries are falling on deaf ears.&quot;<br /><br />i must confess, this is the reason why i have stopped protesting as well.<br /><br />all these protests make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside, but what do they really accomplish? you are all preaching to the choir when you go out and do these things. everyone i talk to is tired of the protests. <br /><br />i just want to see more concrete action, more concrete activism that produces <strong>results. </strong><br /><br />i'm not saying that Rosa would/would not agree with the things that you will be addressing during the protest. but Rosa's motivation in life was to do what was <strong>right.</strong> not because it was the politically &quot;hip&quot; thing to do. <br /><br />i'm not telling you to stop your protest. i'm just saying how i feel about Rosa's name in the protest, and also how i feel about protests. <br /><br />so go ahead and march down wall street, talk about the things that make you angry. it will be cathartic. <br /><br />yes. i am a social worker. i actually DO many things in my work to benefit low-income, at-risk adults and children. and although there are VERY little steps being taken, i believe that what i am doing is changing the way that my clients are treated. by my actions. by my <strong>direct</strong> work with clients, legal officials, and others that are in power.

				I still believe in protest. And it <em>doesn't</em> make me feel all &quot;warm and fuzzy&quot; inside, in fact quite the opposite. Whenever I go to one I am &quot;risking&quot; arrest and have No desire whatsoever to go through the system...yet again.<br /><br />The right to assemble and voice grievances is a right that imo needs to be excercised or it will atrophy. And no, we are <em>not</em> only preaching to the choir...we are Protesting, making our voices known (risking arrest) to those that <em>don't</em> share our opinions that war is &quot;wrong&quot; etc.<br /><br />So please, continue your good work but please don't begrudge us for the Work that <em>we</em> are doing. This is like someone that is fixing a security hole in open-source software criticizing someone who has devoted her life to curing cancer...a case of Apples and oranges and quite, quite pointless. We are a community and we <em>do</em> do direct outreach ourselves (many, many social workers among us), though we don't need to brag about it.<br /><br />I still believe in protest.<br /><br />One example of a successful &quot;protester&quot; ...Mahatma Ghandi, Can you honestly say he was ineffectual? How about Tianneman Square? Was that pointless? I believe you do us a a diservice based on your own negative experience and I can honestly say that I am a little offended... though not that much, because I believe I can understand where you are coming from, no disrespect intended.<br /><br />This conversation grows wearisome and it is obvious that you have won and are right. I concede to your superior experience and knowledge... and keep up the good work.<br /><br />Very tired and too busy for this pointless sparring.<br />Off to the Anime Topic :-)<br />---Zeno<br /><br />ps: It is really ironic that I am defending something that I'm trying to get away from; but there it is. Cheers.

				i would like to see some evidence that these protests, particularly the ones you have posted just this week, are actually changing the views of others, and making change. <br /><br />these protests are very rarely publicized anymore, except for the 'liberal' and 'left wing' groups that are interested in this.<br /><br />and i never said that protesting was a bad thing. it's a good thing. and all the examples that you just posted were EFFECTIVE. &nbsp;<br /><br />i dont think many people are going to take off school, work, and join the protest. <br /><br />sadly, i feel that those who do get arrested, go unnoticed. these protests are very common. <br /><br />and please. do not concede to my 'superior' knowlege. i wouldnt classify myself as that. i always thought that this forum was an open forum for us to voice our opinions. <br /><br />i was also hoping that you'd be able to convince me about the importance of these protests. but. nothing yet. <br /><br />but thanks for the back and forth. i enjoyed it. be safe.

				Didn't mean to snap at you like that.... I've been very exhausted lately and am actually trying to get away from politics. I must of misinterpreted your intentions and you are right for reminding me of the open discussion like nature which sustains these forums.<br /><br />As far as convincing you of the importance of non-violent protest and civil disobedience I really don't know what else to say. My point being that even if they are ineffective (which is difficult to measure) it is at least an attempt to makes one's voice known and is far preferable than silence. In other words, I look at protest not only as one of the many tools of social change but also as an end in itself, an excercise of one's constitutional rights. I can only imagine the day in which there are no protests to be a very grim day indeed. If you want to know the importance of protests let's examine a state in their absence. Not the kind of world that I prefer to live in.<br /><br />As far as who gets to see the protests themselves, you are right in that they don't get adequate coverage. Bush's inaugural address comes to mind... how little we saw on national t.v. Fortunately we do still have an alternative media that shows other angles of the events, although how long that lasts is anyone's guess.<br /><br />I'm sorry again if I seemed irritable and I am even more sorry that I have failed to convince you of the importance of something &nbsp;the importance of which I take for granted. Please keep in mind that I don't think that protesting alone is enough...but it gives me hope (one of the choir) that there is still such a thing as dissent.<br /><br />Keep well and thank you for being so patient with me. I'm still looking for my sense of humor and mirth which got lost somewhere along the wayside.<br />Blessed Be,<br />Zeno ;-)<br /><br />[Later]: Was just reminded of one effects of these protest, actually the vigils that some of the Veterans for Peace perform on a <em>daily</em> basis in particular. Although I am already on the Left I have found the dedication of these people personally inspiring and it gives me incentive to try and do more. It is comforting for me to know that I am not alone in perceiving the injustices that many take for granted as being normal. Events such as these also provide opportunities to connect with other organizations and individuals, which I think is important because it is moving closer to some form of unity, which I think is desperately needed right now. A thousand people all working independently of each other (to my mind) could go a long way if they worked together.<br /><br />Also... even though network news cameras are not watching, anyone walking by on the street can see with their own eyes these large gatherings of people. Let's say that a passerby disagrees with any or all of the views being presented; at least he or she will know that we are there, that there are alternative views differeing from the &quot;satus quo&quot;. For us to remain invisible will only encourage people to make decisions as if we weren't even there. This is not to say that the decision makers will not go ahead anyway with their original plan, but if there is even one small chance that such a show of numbers will influence policy then I believe that it is a small task that requires little effort. It has also been said before that public opinion does carry some weight, and a million people in Washington or even twelve people in front of some corporate headquarters must count for something.<br /><br />Ciao.
