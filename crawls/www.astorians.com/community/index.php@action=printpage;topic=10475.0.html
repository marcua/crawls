				The only justification I have ever heard against it is that &quot;It&#039;s not natural&quot;. Neither is single parenting, divorce or adoption, but I don&#039;t see religious folks trying to make any of those things an issue. <br /><br />If those religious zealots want to protest against gay marriage, do it within your church. &quot;Marriage&quot; is a religious institution and how you want to practice it within your belief system is your business.

				Perhaps it would have been a better argument if I brought up the Jim Crow laws and bans against interracial marriage.&nbsp; Forms of discrimination which were not justifiable in any way.&nbsp; From the NYTimes article which says it better than I can:&nbsp; http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/16/us/16marriage.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=1<br /><br />The Supreme Court was the first state high court to strike down a law barring interracial marriage, in a 1948 decision called Perez v. Sharp. The vote in Perez, like the one in Thursday’s decision, was 4 to 3. The United States Supreme Court did not follow suit until 1967.<br /><br />At present, six of the seven justices on the California court, including all the dissenters, were appointed by Republican governors.<br /><br />The decision was rooted in two rationales, and both drew on the Perez case.<br /><br />The first was that marriage is a fundamental constitutional right.<br /><br />“The right to marry,” Chief Justice George wrote, “represents the right of an individual to establish a legally recognized family with a person of one’s choice and, as such, is of fundamental significance both to society and to the individual.”<br /><br />Chief Justice George conceded that “as an historical matter in this state marriage has always been restricted to a union between a man and a woman.” But “tradition alone,” he continued, does not justify the denial of a fundamental constitutional right. Bans on interracial marriage were, he wrote, sanctioned by the state for many years.<br /><br />In a second rationale from the interracial case, the court struck down the laws banning same-sex marriage on equal protection grounds, also adopting a new standard of review in the process.<br /><br />When courts weigh whether distinctions among people or groups violate the right to equal protection they generally require just a rational basis for the distinction, a relatively easy standard to meet. But when the discrimination is based on race, sex or religion, the courts generally require a more substantial justification.<br /><br />Discrimination based on sexual orientation, the majority ruled on Thursday, also requires that sort of more rigorous justification. The court acknowledged that it was the first state high court to adopt the standard, strict scrutiny, in sexual orientation cases.<br /><br />Lawyers for the state identified two interests to justify reserving the term marriage for heterosexual unions — tradition and the will of the majority. Chief Justice George said neither was sufficient.<br /><br />Still, Chief Justice George took pains to emphasize the limits of the ruling. It does not require ministers, priests or rabbis to perform same-sex marriages, he said.<br /><br />He added that the decision did “not affect the constitutional validity of the existing prohibitions against polygamy and the marriage of close relatives.”<br /><br />

				Lambda Legal&#039;s website has a great FAQ about getting married in California:<br /><br />http://www.lambdalegal.org/publications/factsheets/fs_marriage-for-same-sex-couples-in-california.html (http://www.lambdalegal.org/publications/factsheets/fs_marriage-for-same-sex-couples-in-california.html)<br /><br />Coincidentally, my partner and I were doing the research on this last night -- after two years of a being enGAYged, we finally decided to take the plunge. I finally got my passport (seriously, it took me 2 years to go get it, but only 12 days for it to come in the mail!), so we&#039;ve got Canada or California as options. <br /><br />Up until now, our concern was what would be most likely to be recognized by NYS. Experts in the area believed that Canada was the way to go, believing that NY would be more likely to recognize an international marriage rather than one from another state. <br /><br />Now, though, thanks to Governor Paterson, it seems like both Canadian and California gay marriages would be viewed the same way. <br /><br />I&#039;m wondering though, if NY&#039;s recognition of gay marriages performed in other states will now fill in that Massachusetts loophole, prohibiting out of state couples from marrying there if their home state doesn&#039;t recognize the marriage. It would be really nice (and convenient) if it would.
