				Places I like in LA are:<br /><br />Santa Monica, including the Pier, Farmer&#39;s Market, and 3rd Street Promenade, and the Pacific Ocean (which is more beautiful than the Atlantic Ocean)<br />Take a drive along Pacific Coast Highway<br />Venice Beach<br />Santa Monica Mountains<br />Griffith Park<br />Pasadena&#39;s Old Town<br />Westwood/UCLA area<br />Olvera Street?&nbsp; EAT SOME MEXICAN FOOD WHATEVER YOU DO!<br />

				I only know of a few places in West Hollywood:<br /><br />The Abbey (coffee shoppe by day, lounge by night)<br />Rage - great gay club<br />Basa Nova (one of the most amazing latin restaurants I have ever eaten at).<br /><br />Also, if you like Sushi check out one of the Todai (I prefer the one in the Beverly Center) as it&#39;s a sushi buffet that&#39;s pretty nice

				I&#39;ve never been to LA, nor do I intend ever to go there, but I heard there&#39;s a chain of hamburger places where you tell them how many burger patties and how many pieces of cheese to stack up in one of those things and they&#39;ll do it, even if it&#39;s like 16 of each.&nbsp; That&#39;s where I would go if I ever went to LA.

				Here&#39;s my cultural plug- the Getty Museum, or the Getty Villa in Malibu (which I believe just reopened recently... and we should all get there fast before the remaining curators are arrested and the museum has to send all its objects back to Italy.)

				I&#39;ve only been to the one in San Francisco, but you should go to The Stinking Rose (http://www.thestinkingrose.com/photos.htm#bh) in Beverly Hills.<br /><br />The majority of my time spent in California has been in northern CA, so I can&#39;t tell you really where else to go to in LA. I would definitely recommend checking out the beach, though. We have some friends that live right on the beach in Oceanside (near San Diego), and it is amazing to go to sleep at night with the sound of the ocean. Of course, it is also just amazing to walk along the beach in February and not be absolutely freezing (yes, a little cold, but not like NYC cold ;)).

				I&#39;m digging this thread ... it&#39;s totally a California love-fest.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)<br /><br />The Getty is wonderful!&nbsp; I agree with anzubird.&nbsp; Though, to be perfectly honest, I didn&#39;t really care too much about the art inside.&nbsp; I love the building itself and all the beautiful travertine marble, the gardens, and especially the view!&nbsp; <br /><br />California is so unique in that you get the beach, desert, and mountains pretty much in one place.&nbsp; They&#39;re only very short drives away from each other.&nbsp; Everybody needs to check out the central coast, too ... Santa Barbara, Monterrey, San Luis Obispo ... Beachy like San Diego (which I adore), but there&#39;s a different vibe.&nbsp; Amazing what a four-hour drive can do.&nbsp; Just get on that 101 and head north and prepare to be dazzled.&nbsp;

				Among architectural icons, you should see the new Gehry-designed Disney Concert Hall downtown. There&#39;s one spot where, walking by on the sidewalk, the sun is reflected toward you because of the parabolic shape of the shiny metal. If you find the exact spot, the focused sunlight makes it intensely hot. You might even be able to cook some hotdogs there!<br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_Concert_Hall<br /><br />I second the suggestions to visit downtown Pasadena, the Farmer&#39;s Market, and Griffith Park. Also, drop me an email and I&#39;ll put you in touch with some local friends/tour guides!<br /><br />

				Ohhhhh drive up PCH!! <br /><br />From where your hotel is at drive south on La Brea, then take the 10 highway west to Santa Monica, stop there in Santa Monica (Adjecent to the freeway which turns into Pacific Coast Highway and go to the Third Street Promenade for breakfast, hop back in your car drive back to the freeway to PCH and cruise to Malibu (Sunglasses must be involved ;). Stop at the Getty and stroll the beautiful gardens and see the amazing antiquities they have (FYI you might need reservations to park your car) then hop back in your car continue driving to Gladstones on the beach (a hop, skip and a jump from the Getty) and watch the sunset go down over a nice cool beer ahhh make a wish.<br /><br />Universal Studio&#39;s and City Walk are a close ride from your hotel. I believe if, you don&#39;t want to drive or save on parking you can take the &quot;Red Line Metro&quot; (on the corner of Hollywood and Highland)directly there. It let&#39;s you off on the other side of the pass so, you just walk up the hill to the City Walk... They might still have Ice Skating right now if, the sun hasn&#39;t melted it.<br /><br />Also, the sunset strip if, your looking for that. I would take a bus or a cab because parking there (though close to you) can cost anywhere from 25-40 bucks... they have theme bars like saddle ranch, dublins, The Argyle, The Standard and Chateau Marmont.<br /><br />I also like Venice. You not really a tourist unless you check that out. If, you take Washinton Boulevarde west to the beach (you can actually park your car right next to the sand) there&#39;s a couple fun places there and a really yummy resturant called C&amp;O. (there&#39;s two of them make sure you go to the one all the way down by the beach) C&amp;O is an Itailian themed resturant with Chianti running ammuck in glass barrells that is on the honour system. You can get an enourmous plate of pasta that two people can share for about 12 bucks and chianti at 5 a glass you can&#39;t beat it. There are a couple bars on the same street. One is the Baja Cantina where Margarita&#39;s and Nachos are the specialty oooo&#39; I almost forgot..... tequila, lot&#39;s of it (the Cadillac Margarita&#39;s make me forget my name) Then there&#39;s The Townhouse where all the locals go and the Whaler that usually has Karaoke on the Balcony (kinda fun).<br /><br />Main Street Santa Monica is fun at night too.... But, it can be like a frat party sometimes.<br /><br />My favorite Resturant is on the south end of Main Street Santa Monica called Chaya. A little pricey but, it&#39;s an absolute treat, and across the street is the Firehouse which has a pretty good selection of wines and beers to finish the night off.<br /><br />I would avoid Downtown at NIGHT unless you know exactly where your going. It can be desolate at night and no help from cops if, you get lost.... If, you must go to downtown at night I would go to the Standard Downtown (there&#39;s two, one&#39;s on the strip and the other on is downtown). That place has an amazing view of downtown at night and usually has a DJ spinning.<br /><br />For something you can walk to from your hotel, you can go to the Roosevelt Hotel, they have a couple Bars and a DJ spinning at night.<br /><br />If, you go flat broke you can stop at my mom&#39;s house. She&#39;ll make you Gnocchi to die for.<br /><br />Good Luck on the show, have fun and don&#39;t come back saying &quot;Dude&quot; and/or &quot;Awesome&quot;

				Aqua, my sister keeps a blog of places to go and things to do in LA (http://www.carolineoncrack.com/). Check out the category list in the right column if you&#39;re looking for a specific type of place. She seems to be particularly good about finding fun bars and great restaurants. I&#39;m always adding stuff to my to-do list for my next visit.

				aquaecny, the place I mentioned to you a couple of weeks ago is the Pico Kosher Deli (http://losangeles.citysearch.com/profile/62534/los_angeles_ca/pico_kosher_deli.html):&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />8826 W. Pico Blvd. (Robertson Blvd.)<br />Los Angeles, CA 90035<br />310-273-9381<br /><br />Since it&#39;s strictly kosher, it&#39;s not open on Saturdays (and probably closes early on Fridays), and don&#39;t look for cheese on your steak sandwich.&nbsp; But their steak sandwich with sauteed onions on garlic bread is one of the best sandwiches I&#39;ve ever had anywhere.&nbsp; *swoon*

				2 things:<br /><br />Find a Marukai - it&#39;s a Japanese &quot;supermarket&quot; that sells EVERYTHING and it&#39;s awesome - their English website is difficult to read because of the unfortunate font they chose but you might be able to get a glimpse of the wonderfulness that is Marukai<br /><br />and<br /><br />splurge and go to dinner at Crustacean - I think it&#39;s in Beverly Hills and it&#39;s a RELIGIOUS experience.&nbsp; It started out as a little Vietnamese crab joint called Thang Long in SF and then expanded into Crustacean in SF and BH.&nbsp; Order the crab and the garlic noodles (also known as crack in my book).&nbsp; VERY expensive but worth every penny.&nbsp; Probably have to make reservations - gorgeous restaurant, too.
