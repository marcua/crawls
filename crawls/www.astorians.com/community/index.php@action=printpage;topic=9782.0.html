Also, it has not been over turned totally, by any court. Sounds patriotic to me. It&#039;s infinately more patriotic than making baseless accusations&nbsp; against&nbsp; the President and coddling terrorists. Whether one supports terrorists,intentionally or not, the result is&nbsp; the same. Truth is Obama&nbsp; is&nbsp; a Rolling Stone/Media&nbsp; Hype, in any other&nbsp; time this guy wouldn&#039;t be a Senator, let alone the frontrunner&nbsp; for President. I don&#039;t believe he is a &#039;bad&#039; person, he seems like&nbsp; a&nbsp; real nice guy, but, so are alot of people&nbsp; who shouldn&#039;t be President during a war.

				Not to put too fine a point on it , but doesn&#039;t that link point out that these were &quot;violations of the Patriot Act&quot;? <br />BTW, I totally agree with the original post that Couch is a tool and what he is proposing violates the Constitution.<br />On the other hand I fail to see how the actual Patriot Act is violating citizens rights.

Although I do believe those are the kinds of doors the Patriot act opens up. <br />The violation of citizen rights is the provisions allowing roving wiretaps without court approval, and other such wiretaps that do not require search warrants. I believe it is a violation of citizen rights to circumvent warrants, because they exist so that the judicial system can protect citizens by judging whether or not reasonable cause for search and surveillance exists. <br />There is also the immigration provision that allows detainment of any alien, legal or illegal, without due process or trial. Granted, they are not American citizens, but if they are subject to our laws, they should be subject to our trial process as well.
