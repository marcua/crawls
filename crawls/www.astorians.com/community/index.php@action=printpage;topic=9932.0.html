				Some friends suggested trying the new hibachi place on 23rd ave.&nbsp; I&#039;m immediately wary of this place (How long did we see this coming in and rant about not needing another sushi place? - about 10 months), but figured I&#039;d at least give it a try.&nbsp; Anyone already been the guinea pig before I offer myself up?<br /><br />Thanks!

				I went there last night with a couple of friends and was not very impressed.&nbsp; Mind you, I&#039;m not really a foodie, but even I noticed it wasn&#039;t so great.<br /><br />We had hibachi, not sushi, and it was sort of &quot;un-traditional&quot; if you&#039;re used to the typical Benihana-type hibachi.&nbsp; It was served with fried rice, which was good, but their idea of vegetables was some shredded lettuce, scallions, and onions.&nbsp; The meat was cooked fine and quite tasty, but it was cut in long strips and not &quot;bite size&quot;, chopstick-friendly morsels.&nbsp; It was also served in some kind of teriyaki sauce and not with a side of ginger sauce, which is what&#039;s usually given.&nbsp; The place that used to be open on Steinway Street (right next to Victoria&#039;s Secret) was MUCH better.<br /><br />They have a traditional hibachi table in the back that can seat a large group, but it wasn&#039;t being used last night so we just had it served from the kitchen.&nbsp; The worst part was that it was EXPENSIVE.&nbsp; The bill was about $100 for 3 people.&nbsp; Granted, we had an appetizer, 3 drinks, and 3 entrees, but that seems like a little much, especially for mediocre food in Astoria.

				Thanks for the review, YaFace!<br /><br />I noticed yesterday that there&#039;s a sign out front that says &quot;Now Serving Chinese Food&quot;. That&#039;s a sure sign of death for a new restaurant -- changing the type of cuisine just a month after opening!<br /><br />I&#039;m guessing this place is gone by Labor Day. Drat. I was hoping it would actually be good...

				I think it may be a goner - every time I pass by there are so few people in there.&nbsp; At one time, we complained that there were not enough Japanese places in Astoria and now there are too many, all competing for the same piece of the pie.

				I wish one of the restauranteurs who was looking to open another chinese, thai or japanese restaurant would instead open a vietnamese restaurant, something that Astoria doesn&#039;t have (I&#039;m too lazy to go to Elmhurst every time I get a craving).

				Over priced and under impressive - to say the atmosphere is better than Dragon&#039;s Gate is like comparing it to the atmosphere in hell&nbsp; - although the food was probably better&nbsp; :evil:

				We tried it last night, and I don&#039;t see how it is over priced.<br /><br />We had:<br /><br />2 glasses of wine<br />Veg. Tempura<br />Shrimp Pad Tai<br />Veg. Habachi<br /><br />$35 including the tip.&nbsp; The food was overall good, not the best habachi I&#039;ve ever had, but certainly above medicore.&nbsp; <br />

				That place was a huge disappointment. We absolutely love teppanyaki (what everyone calls hibachi). And I mean things like Gasho upstate, not wannabe&#039;s like Benihana.<br /><br />Anyway, we just moved to Astoria in August 2007 and saw the signs for Kitaku coming for 6 months. We were so excited seeing that on the way to the train each day. When it finally opened they had just one &quot;hibachi&quot; table and never used it as far as I can tell.<br /><br />We&#039;ve been for hibachi and sushi and both were huge letdowns. The only thing we really liked was the lobster cream soup and when we went back for it the recipe was completely different and kind of nasty.<br /><br />As for the prices, they seem to change every time we walk past. Like someone else wrote, the &quot;we now serve chinese food&quot; is a death sentence.<br /><br />We&#039;ll stick with Watawa for our Japanese, thanks...

				The original Gasho is the one upstate near Woodbury Commons. Its a japanese farmhouse deconstructed, shipped here and rebuilt. It&#039;s really amazing. They have since franchised out a bit including the ones you mentioned. I haven&#039;t tried those yet, but I make sure to stop at the original in Harriman every time I pass through.

				first of all... it sucks cause its not japanese. remember dragon gate next door? the chinese food. yea well same owners they just decided japanese is more trendy and profitable. so they closed down chinese and opened up jap. DONT YOU PEOPLE KNOW?Huh?<br />NEVER EAT AT A PLACE THAT HAVE 3 DIFFERENT MENUS! ONE CHINESE ONE JAPANESE ONE THAI ARE YOU KIDDING ME?? JACK OF ALL TRADES MASTER OF NONE!<br /><br />I guess you have to be an astoria born and raised and still resident to know everything .<br /><br />the best place for sushi in all of astoria and possibly all of nyc is called sushi kin. its across from trade fair on ditmars blvd. i think its 36 or 37 street could be 38th, i dont even know, but im there all the time. see kids the difference is IT IS REALLY JAPANESE. its not chinese-watawa korean- sakura kumo-korean go wasabi- korean. its japanese and japanese people eat there. the quality will blow your face off. take it from someone who has had sushi in japan. mr. tanaka knows whats good. and he&#039;ll tell you what&#039;s the best on that day, and thats what you are suppost to order, authentic thats how they do it in japan.

				I live a few blocks away, and would eat there more regularly if it wasn&#039;t so damn expensive.&nbsp; The prices are NOT right for the &#039;hood, and the rolls weren&#039;t anything extraordinary.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t try the other menu items.&nbsp; The place is perpetually empty-looking.&nbsp; The food was marginally better than Go Wasabi, but that place had gone so far downhill in the past few years I&#039;m shocked that it held on that long.&nbsp; Bottom line:&nbsp; WAY overpriced.&nbsp; I could just as soon eat in Manhattan for that money and get better food (which wouldn&#039;t be hard to do).<br /><br />I miss Dragon Gate--they were the only OK Chinese takeout in the area.&nbsp; They had AMAZING spare ribs, but I digress.<br /><br />OTOH there&#039;s a new cheapie Brazillian riodizio place next to them, next door to Omega Wines and Spirits, that looks amazing.&nbsp; It&#039;s also just ramping up crowdwise but I am friendly with the family that owns Omega and they all say it&#039;s delicious.&nbsp; <br />

				Do you guys have any suggestions on how Kitaku can improve though? I&#039;d like to get more feedback for this restaurant because I believe they do have good potential to be better if they know ways in which they can improve their business. I mean I&#039;ve tried a few things from their menu and I do agree that this place needs improvement but going once there doesn&#039;t quite give me a sense of what they were really good at so I have gone to their restaurant quite a few times to know.
