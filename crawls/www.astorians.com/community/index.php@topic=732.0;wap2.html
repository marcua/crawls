			From 9/11/01 on, people have called the terrorist hijackers cowardly. &nbsp;A very odd word IMO for people who completely cast aside their instinct for self-preservation. &nbsp;But to think that the word fits is a kind of orthodoxy. &nbsp;Bill Maher paid for challenging the word; William Safire didn't, but his conservative credentials were impeccable.<br /><br />Today I worshipped at a church in Manhattan, and the pastor spoke of the &quot;cowardly attack.&quot; &nbsp;I told her I thought &quot;cowardly&quot; was the wrong word for people who act in the face of certain death, and she said that maybe in that sense they weren't cowardly. &nbsp;But I didn't have the presence of mind to ask her in what sense they were cowardly.<br /><br />Now we sometimes say of people who kill themselves out of despair that they are cowards because they won't face life, but Islamist suicide bombers are not like that. &nbsp;Terrorist organizations reject depressed people who are trying to end an unbearable life.<br /><br />Furthermore, &quot;cowardly&quot; seems to be a term reserved for the criminal rabble; we never hear a gangland murder called a cowardly attack.<br /><br />So what do you think? &nbsp;In what sense were the 9/11 attackers cowards?

			I agree with you in the sense that &quot;coward&quot; is probably not the best word to use to describe a terrorist.<br /><br />I think the closest way you could relate the word &quot;cowardly&quot; to what happened on 9/11 was simply the fact that they chose to kill innocent people who were defensless against them.<br /><br />According to western concepts of fighting, warriors are supposed to abide by certain rules (even &quot;respect&quot; each other). So in this sense, the idea that these people have a beef with the United States Government, and choose to take out their anger on &quot;innocent&quot; people could be seen as cowardly. The &quot;rules&quot; say that you have to fight someone your own size - this mentality is widespread.<br /><br />Of course it totally depends on your mindset. I personally know people who, if an angel of light appeared in their bedroom and told them to kill someone would do it without quesitoning. I even know a few Christians that seem to think it's ok to do a certain amount of killing if the result is an increase of the spreading of the &quot;Gospel&quot;. I also know a few capitalists, liberals, conservatives, environmentalists who feel the same way. These people could also be labeled as cowards, however I'm sure there's a solid argument out there that would label these people as honorable, or even heroes (depending on the paradigm you argue from). <br /><br />It seems to me that extremism is not something that's limited to Islam or Christianity (or religion at all), but sadly pervades every aspect of our culture. <br /><br />I think that calling someone a &quot;coward&quot; maybe is just a way for people to &quot;retaliate&quot; without trying to understand their enemy. I also think that if one could really see all this from &quot;God's&quot; perspective, one might find that we're all not that different from each other (globally speaking) after all.

			i'd call it criminal, vicious, brutal, cruel, inhumane, and completely f---ed up, but i wouldn't call it cowardly. &nbsp;<br /><br />i can see what merm means about attacking the helpless, but i probably wouldn't use the word cowardly.

			If the church bulletin listed a Website or e-mail address I would e-mail the pastor and ask her in what sense she thought the word was appropriate. &nbsp;As it is, I'm trying to fathom why those who do think the word is appropriate think it's appropriate.<br /><br />Right now, I can think only of two reasons:<br /><br />1. The word is undergoing a semantic drift akin to &quot;dastardly&quot; before it. &nbsp;&quot;Dastardly&quot; once meant &quot;cowardly&quot; but now means contemptible, as well as &quot;criminal, vicious, brutal, cruel, inhumane, and completely f---ed up.&quot; &nbsp;But people have forgotten what &quot;dastardly&quot; once meant because no one is called a dastard anymore. &nbsp;The only place I ever saw that word was in Scott's poem &quot;Lochinvar,&quot; in which Ellen was about to marry &quot;a dastard in war.&quot; &nbsp;OTOH everyone knows what a coward is, and I've never heard the hijackers referred to as cowards.<br /><br />2. Other crimes, such as the embassy bombings in Africa, were called cowardly, so it seems consistent to apply the word to an even more heinous act of terrorism.<br /><br />But this pastor is very thoughtful and very precise in her choice of words. &nbsp;She never uses a word in her preaching that she doesn't mean.<br /><br />The &quot;pick on somebody your own size&quot; argument is very plausible. &nbsp;In _The Wonderful Wizard of Oz_ the Cowardly Lion was called a coward precisely because he picked on Toto. &nbsp;OTOH it seems that only acts of terrorism are called cowardly. &nbsp;Child abuse is not called cowardly, nor is union-busting violence. &nbsp;Even rabid prolifers don't call abortion cowardly. &nbsp;Further back in history, the massacre at My Lai was roundly condemned but it wasn't called cowardly.<br /><br />And so, back to bed.[/i]

			I just Googled the names of the church and the pastor and found out that the church does indeed have a Website and an e-mail address. &nbsp;But I'd still be interested in anything any of you have to say.
