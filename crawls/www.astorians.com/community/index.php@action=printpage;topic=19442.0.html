				I&#039;m not sure if they even have a website yet because they&#039;re so new, but there&#039;s a place above Moonstruck on the corner of Broadway and 33rd St that teaches yoga all day every day, and the classes are only $5. Not free, but pretty damn close, and they&#039;re great hour-plus long workout/relaxation sessions!

				Just wanted to add to this thread. I took a class last night at Yoga Agora and it was wonderful. <br />Friendly atmosphere, good instructor, great space. I felt guilty only paying $5. The class was <br />vinyasa, but geared to all levels. It was hard for me, but in a good way. I usually do pilates and<br />very little yoga so some of the moves/poses were just unfamiliar to me/my body. But the instructor<br />was great. She really emphasized going at your own pace, listening to your body and just doing what<br />you can do.<br /><br />I&#039;m pretty fit and healthy, but I was dripping with sweat at the end and felt great. This is a great addition<br />to the neighborhood and I hope they&#039;re around for a long time.

				The class I went to on Monday night was a bit crowded. I think there were 18 people, maybe 20. But there was enough room for everyone. <br /><br />I&#039;m not that great at yoga either. I&#039;m very fit and normally do pilates 3x/week, so I have good core strength. But yoga poses don&#039;t come easily for me since my muscles are often tight and I&#039;m not flexible. <br /><br />That said, I didn&#039;t find it too hard to keep up. And the instructor was very emphatic about telling us to listen to the body, give it what it needs. &quot;If you need to come out of a pose, just take a stretch or go into child&#039;s pose,&quot; was something she said several times. Also, she tried doing some advanced variations on some things, but immediately said not to try them if you weren&#039;t up for it or didn&#039;t feel comfortable doing it.<br /><br />If you&#039;re up for it, I&#039;d give it a try. They do have a beginners class which I think is on Thursday in the afternoon&nbsp; - check their schedule. But if you show up early, just speak to the instructor and let them know you&#039;re a beginner. I found the atmosphere very friendly and welcoming. <br /><br />And I plan to go back tomorrow night and give it another go. <br /><br />Finally, if you find you don&#039;t care for it, you&#039;ve only spent $5.<br /><br />Good luck.<br />

				I stopped into Yoga Agora last night, and it was kind of a mixed bag (for me at least). I&#039;m definitely new to the Yoga thing, but I&#039;m enjoying it so far. Prior to my class at Yoga Agora I had taken two beginner classes at the Yoga Room to get a feel for whether or not I&#039;d even like yoga.&nbsp; <br />So I got to the studio last night, and it&#039;s literally a one room operation, a few cubbies for your baggage and a couple small changing rooms. By the time the class started I think there were about 25 people ready to practice.&nbsp; The class itself was, for me, somewhat fast paced, and I didn&#039;t really get a chance to concentrate on my form.&nbsp; I think that, from a beginner&#039;s standpoint (and I am probably the epitome of a beginner) I appreciate a little more guidance, but with 25 people in a class, that gets understandably difficult. <br />All that said, I got through the whole class without too much trouble, the instructor wasn&#039;t one to really push you to do anything that you couldn&#039;t or weren&#039;t comfortable doing.&nbsp; All in all, for a $5 class, I can see myself going back once or twice a week, because it&#039;s really easy for me to stop in after work. If it&#039;s your first time trying yoga, I would definitely recommend trying a beginner&#039;s class (Agora offers one during the day) before jumping into Yoga Agora&#039;s $5 classes.

				I was there last night too - for the 7 p.m. class. It definitely has been more crowded since the new year began. <br />A friend of mine has taken the beginner&#039;s class on Saturday afternoon and he really likes it.<br /><br />I&#039;m technically a beginner - I&#039;m very fit, but had been doing pilates for several years and wanted a change.<br />I started going to Yoga Agora in the fall and now I go 2 or 3 times a week.<br /><br />Each instructor has their own style of teaching, but none push you beyond what your abilities are or what you&#039;re <br />comfortable with. My favorite instructors there are Nick, Anna, Rebecca and Rikki (she taught last night&#039;s class.)<br /><br />I just like the atmosphere there - very casual, not uptight and I don&#039;t feel uncomfortable when I&#039;m next to someone<br />who&#039;s more advanced. <br />

				Well, if you noticed a tall, fattish fellow who, about halfway through the class looked like someone had opened a sweat spigot in the middle of his face (aka the fourth guy, the one who clearly isn&#039;t in shapre), that was me. Again, I am the epitome of a beginner.&nbsp; Prior to my first beginner&#039;s class 3 weeks ago, I literally didn&#039;t know a single yoga pose. I had never done pilates.&nbsp; I ran and cycled and lifted weights, but that&#039;s nothing like yoga. <br />So while it&#039;s definitely a casual environment, and I really enjoyed my class, I feel like I still have more to learn about the individual poses and execution before I will really feel comfortable with the pace last night.<br />That said, I&#039;ll probably head back one or two nights again next week.

				You&#039;re funny! I&#039;m wondering if you were the guy in front of me along the windows - I was the last in that row in the back. But I sweat a lot too there, which is why I like it. The poses are hard for me because I&#039;m still getting used to them. <br />That&#039;s what I&#039;m liking about it though - for me it&#039;s challenging but not overwhelming. <br /><br />If you make it a habit and go at least 2 nights a week for a few weeks, you&#039;ll feel more comfortable.<br />If you are who I think you are and I think I see you again (god that reads just awful!) I&#039;ll say hi!<br />

				I went to Yoga Agora&#039;s 3:30pm beginner&#039;s class yesterday.&nbsp; I wonder if any other Astorians posters were there.&nbsp; I have to say, I enjoyed myself.&nbsp; While this wasn&#039;t too foreign to me (I&#039;ve attended 2 or 3 yoga classes over the past ten years), this was just my speed.&nbsp; Juan went slow and was very encouraging.&nbsp; I found most of it doable, but a little challenging and it definitely got me sweaty.&nbsp; And I&#039;m a little sore, but it&#039;s a good sore...not the kind of sore that makes it difficult to walk for a few days.

				That was me. I missed last night thanks to an absolutely insane work week, but I&#039;m planning on hitting the wednesday classes on a regular basis. This week, though, it looks like it&#039;s just beginner&#039;s class at the yoga room on Saturday.

				OK, I think I remember who you were! I was there last night - Rikki&#039;s class. It was tough - a lot of <br />balancing and a bit of wobbling on my part. But a good class. Even when I&#039;m feeling tired/stiff, I do<br />feel better after I leave there. Good luck w/the beginner class - I&#039;m hoping to take it one Saturday<br />when I have some free time. I think it would do me some good!<br />

				I think they&#039;re a bit crowded too. I arrived one night just after a 5:00 class ended - about 6:25. And a lot<br />of people were coming out. I also took a Saturday 5:00 class a few weeks ago that was packed. <br /><br />If you&#039;re particular about the kind of spot you want - say up front or whatever - you need to get there at<br />least 15 or 20 minutes before class time. <br /><br />But, on the flip side, if you get there right before start time, the instructors are very accommodating about<br />making space for you wherever they can. I&#039;ve never seen anyone turned away. <br />
