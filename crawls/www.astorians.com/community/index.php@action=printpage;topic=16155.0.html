				I have two tickets to The Decemberists at Terminal 5 this Saturday the 19th at 7PM. $37.50 per ticket.<br />It should be a fun show and I am bummed that I can&#039;t go.&nbsp; For those who know them, they are taking a break from performing their &quot;Hazards of Love&quot; album to do a night of requests- whatever that means.&nbsp; <br />If interested please let me know, thanks.

				I am willing to negotiate a bit on the price.&nbsp; I would rather someone go to the show and enjoy it, than the tickets stay stuck to the side of my fridge.&nbsp; Let me know.

				I&#039;ve been to six Decemberists shows now (and will be going to this one) and, for those considering going, their concerts are a hoot.&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve also caught the Decemberists live and they are fun - great story-telling songs.&nbsp; Wish I could change my Saturday plans - someone should grab these tickets fast!

				First, Im gonna say thanks.<br /><br />A little about the concert in a bit.<br />This was my first time checking out Terminal 5. (Not the one at JFK.)<br />I was prepared for the worst, and it turns out to me to be only slightly less of a venue than most general admission others. Isolated on the far west side of midtown.<br />I would rather bands play elsewhere, but if I want to see a band, I would go back to T5.<br />The sound was better than expected. Did not see much of the band though.<br /><br />For the music, I think I have underestimated the <span class="bbc_u">Decemberists</span>. I love U2. This band may be having a grand career like them.<br />A band has to be pretty good to have a concert based on random pickings from their list of songs. <br />Their song list is broad and strong.<br /><br />I do wonder though whether the song choices were manipulated in some ways.<br />The MC picked from a lottery wheel 3 songs at a time. An evening of several sets of 3 songs.<br />I think once or twice the band did change the order of songs played. The element of surprise did add to the evening, so I hope they would do something like this again. <br />Almost forgot one fun silliness, was hearing a song improvised about playing in NY near the Miracle on the Hudson.<br /><br />Some songs were in the middle when they more likely would have been played at the end of a concert. And I think by luck the song choices early on were more interesting than later. Quite a few during the concert were from Crane&#039;s Wife. (My they have a lot of song titles starting with the word The)<br />New songs sounded great. The band was great with wonderful versatility of instruments.<br /><br />Very early picks included Raincoat Song and July July.<br />I did not notice if they did any cover songs. Rake&#039;s song is a live standout.<br /><br />Another superb concert in a year of quite a few very good ones.<br />Hope to see them again another year. <br />

				I had a great time at the concert!&nbsp; <br /><br />This was my 6th Decemberists concert and they are by far my favorite band. My favorite concert was their Hollywood Bowl performance with the LA Philharmonic.&nbsp; It&#039;s too bad they didn&#039;t cut a live album of that or any other of their orchestral concerts because their music really lends itself well with a symphony.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Saturday night they did play one cover, one of my favorite covers: Bridges and Balloons by Joanna Newsom.&nbsp; Her lyrics are very Decemberists-like in that they are all rich, lyrical and slightly tongue-twisty.<br /><br /><div align="center">The sight of bridges and balloons<br />Makes calm canaries irritable<br />And they caw and claw all afternoon<br />Catenaries and derigibles<br />Brace and buoy the living room<br />A loom of metals warp woof wimble<br />And a thimble&#039;s worth of milky moon<br />Can touch hearts larger than a thimble</div><br />I was very happy with the picks:&nbsp; I Was Meant For the Stage, The Raincoat, The Rake and The Cranewife #3.&nbsp; Good stuff.&nbsp; I could have done without The Tain.&nbsp; It&#039;s a great piece, but at 20 mins at length, I&#039;d prefer a few more sing-a-long type songs.&nbsp; But they, that&#039;s apparently what fate (or the MC) has in store for us.
