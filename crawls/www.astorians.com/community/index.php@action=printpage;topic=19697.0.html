				With the holidays coming up, many of you may be making plans for family visiting Astoria. There aren&#039;t a lot of hotels in the area, and you may be looking for something more convenient than the ones near La Guardia or LIC.<br /><br />My husband and I have just furnished a two-bedroom apartment on the 3rd floor of our house that&#039;s now available for short-term rental. It&#039;s small, but it sleeps four people and is sunny, private, and pleasantly furnished. We&#039;re less than a 10-minute walk from the Ditmars stop (the house is visible in the banner at the top of this page, in fact!), so it&#039;s probably quite convenient to many of you and to getting into Manhattan.<br /><br />Pictures and detailed information available here: http://www.astoriaguesthouse.com. Please get in touch if you have any questions!<br /><br /><br />

				It&#039;s on 32nd Street in the block just north of 21st Ave. I&#039;m glad you pointed that out -- I&#039;ve added the coordinates and a location map to the site.<br /><br />Thanks so much for the positive feedback!

				Thanks for the positive feedback -- I can see that a lot of you have been checking out our site!<br /><br />I&#039;ve just had a last-minute cancellation and the space is available now during November and much of December -- in case anyone was looking for lodging for family during Thanksgiving or the lead-up to Christmas, it&#039;s available again!

				Hello,<br /><br />I am looking for a place to sublet/rent near us (we are on Crescent and 24th Ave.) for 10 days in mid April for family (professional, retired couple) that are coming to visit.<br />I saw this post, while searching online and it looks like something we may be interested in, BUT I have no way of contacting the owner as I do not see any contact info. on the website (www.astoriaguesthouse.com). Can anyone help with this?<br /><br />Kinds Regards,<br />Sue

				Hi Sue,<br /><br />I&#039;ve taken down the contact form for the time being because we&#039;ve had long-term tenants staying with us, and I didn&#039;t know when we&#039;ll be able to have new bookings again (there&#039;s a notification to that effect on the home page, but it&#039;s not very prominent!)<br /><br />It now turns out that we will be vacant starting in late April or early May, but it doesn&#039;t sound like that&#039;s going to work for your timing! Please keep us in mind if you need a place to stay in the future, though!
