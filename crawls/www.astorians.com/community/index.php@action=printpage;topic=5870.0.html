				So, I don&#039;t watch American Idol, but I&#039;ve noted some chatter around the internets and television lately about the contestant Sanjaya, and how some people love him and some people hate him.&nbsp; I&#039;ve gathered that he&#039;s not that good a singer, but hasn&#039;t been voted off, which, based on some cursory watching of late-stage American Idol in seasons past, I have to say, what else is new?&nbsp; It seems like usually it&#039;s white girls who get stay on the show despite sucking, whereas he is South Asian.&nbsp; Is this perhaps what has some people so worked up?<br />Thoughts?

				Well, the person voted off this last week just so happened to be a crappy no-talent white girl.&nbsp; And Sanjaya does suck, but not much worse than all but 2, maybe 3 of the final remaining &quot;singers.&quot;

				I actually like Sanjaya. &nbsp;I think he has a nice voice, however, they don&#039;t see him being of &quot;idol&quot; stature. &nbsp;There are strong singers on the show and some have already been voted off that were, if only a tad, better than Sanjaya. &nbsp;<br /><br />The whole controversy is that he&#039;s generating votes for being &quot;the worst&quot; singer, per votefortheworst.com, as well as, Howard Sterns following. &nbsp;He&#039;d (Howard) like to see an end to &quot;American Idol&quot; so they&#039;re completely throwing off, or trying to anyway, the voting so that the worst wins thus rendering the show a complete farce. &nbsp;<br /><br />Regardless, I feel for Sanjaya. &nbsp;I&#039;d hate to think I was still on the show because people thought I was the worst. &nbsp; :|

				Sanjaya a wonderful entertainer.&nbsp; No really.&nbsp; He&#039;s got a certain charm that draws people to him.&nbsp; He performs well, and every week it&#039;s something new with him, mostly his hair.&nbsp; The little girls seem to adore him.&nbsp; He cannot sing very well at all, but then again, that doesn&#039;t always matter.&nbsp; There are plenty of so-so singers out there, who are amazing performers on stage.&nbsp; And plenty of amazing singers who have no stage presence.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think people are upset that he is South Asian.&nbsp; I think they are upset that he can&#039;t sing, and every week he stays on.&nbsp; It ruins the credibility of the show.&nbsp; Not that it has much to begin with.&nbsp; But there are some great singers in the contest right now, so the show isn&#039;t all bad.&nbsp;

				Lol, I just assumed that voting on American Idol was as real as the wrestling in pro wrestling and people were &quot;voted&quot; on and off based on what the network executives think shall generate the most interest/advertising revenues?

				www.votefortheworst.com<br /><br />I know what ya mean jentastico. &nbsp;I think people are keeping him along just because of his race and entertainment ability. &nbsp;But as Simon has always pointed out, American Idol is a singing competition. &nbsp;People need to start voting because of the singing, not ethnicity, popularity, cuteness, what have you. &nbsp;I uesd to watch the show regularly, but have dropped out this season.<br /><br /><br />FYI:<br />In my opinion, and many others, the front runners happen to be three black women and a white guy. &nbsp;So it is not just white women. &nbsp;Only twice has a white female won the competition

				But wait - isn&#039;t this show called &quot;American Idol&quot;?&nbsp; Since when did pure talent enter the picture?&nbsp; Does Britney Spears have real singing ability?&nbsp; A resounding NO.&nbsp; Does Madonna?&nbsp; Not really.&nbsp; This show is absolutely about popularity, cuteness and entertainment value.&nbsp; Producers and engineers have the job of making these people into adequate singers.

				It&#039;s the Miracle of Sanjaya!!<br />No - Seriously - it&#039;s a combination of a heavy Indian - desi - vote - they never had an Indian American Idol contestant before - and an unusally high vote for the worst vote this year - advocated by Howard Stern, Opie and Anthony and many other radio hosts across the country. At best he is mediocre (night he did Diana Ross and looked like her) most times he&#039;s abysmal.<br /><br />The week with the fauz Mohawk - it seemed like he was deliberately trying to get himself booted. The way he sang - it was like he wasn&#039;t even trying.&nbsp; &nbsp;That was the week I declared it to be the Miracle of Sanjaya :mrgreen:

				You mean he&#039;s not?<br /><br />Maybe these guys are all successful in certain markets.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure they&#039;re all making more money than I am.<br /><br />I think what I was trying to say is that the show is called &quot;American Idol,&quot; which would mean that the winner is supposed to represent who the majority of America wants, but with the two exceptions - Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood - I don&#039;t really think the winners have reflected America&#039;s taste in music.&nbsp; At the time, America may have thought that singer was who they&#039;d want to listen to down the line, but as time has gone on, most of the winners have lost their popularity.&nbsp; Clay may be popular to a select audience, but I&#039;m guessing that most of the people who fanatically voted for him are no longer interested in him at all, whereas Kelly Clarkson has maintained a steady following to the present, even though she won the thing a while ago.&nbsp; The reason for this being that Kelly Clarkson sings the type of music that America really buys.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think that Reuben and Clay had specific fan followings - similar to, as someone mentioned, Sanjaya being popular with Indians, - who devoted themselves to one or the other winning, whereas Kelly Clarkson had more mass appeal.<br /><br />Now, I really hope someone closes or deletes this thread, so that I can stop talking about American Idol and feel good about myself again.

				i think american idol even though a reality show is a great platform for its artists that are lucky enough to end up in the top 5. Elliott Yamin from last season is in my opinion extremely talented and wouldn&#039;t have ever had a shot to make his own album without idol. The same for Kelly Clarkson, who is a bonafide superstar that would still be waiting tables in Texas if not for idol.<br /><br />I blame the idol execs for Sanjaya. They did it to themselves. They should have picked his sister over him (much more talented vocally, and a better &quot;look&quot;). This whole sanjaya thing has bit them back, there is no way he deserved the top 20, NO WAY. they kid has no stage presence and his voice is AVERAGE, at best.<br /><br />I hope he gets voted off this week, but more importantly... i hope Idol wises up for next year. True talent always rises up past hype.
