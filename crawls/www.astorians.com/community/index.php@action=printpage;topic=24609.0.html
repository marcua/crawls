				There is a Yoga studio on 31st street but most of the better known places are between 36th avenue and Broadway. The Yoga Room is the reigning queen of yoga and pilates in Astoria and LIC but the smaller schools around the B&#039;way area may be less costly.

				Yoga Agora - 33rd Street &amp; Broadway - has a few &#039;basics&#039; classes for beginners. Their regular classes are <br />open level, but tend toward the intermediate. Website is yogaagora.com<br />Their classes are excellent&nbsp; - the instructors really know what they&#039;re doing and the atmosphere is warm, friendly<br />and everyone is very encouraging. <br /><br /><br />With pilates, the best classes I ever took were at Power Pilates in Manhattan - powerpilates.com <br />I go to the studio on 23rd Street between 5th &amp; 6th Avenues - Chelsea studio on their site if you want<br />to check the schedule. <br /><br /><br />There is also the Yoga Room, but I think they&#039;re pricey for Astoria. I don&#039;t mind paying city prices in the city,<br />but not in Astoria. <br /><br />

				Well, TYR has some of the best teachers from all over the city, including some of my personal favorites from multiple disciplines. The sheer variety of classes offered there, ranging from Iyengar to Yin to Brakan style hot Vinyasa, could help you figure out what works best for you. If you are completely new to yoga, I strongly recommend trying a beginners&#039; Iyengar class to learn the physics and mechanics of basic postures. I see to many people, including myself when I started out, jumping into physically intensive vinyasa classes without really learning to how to support their joints, spine and neck. <br /><br />I&#039;ve heard great things about Yoga Agora as an alternative to Yoga for the People but can&#039;t personally vouch for it. Tone Pilates may be your cup of tea as well, so check them out. This small schools run by well liked ex-TYR instructors and is right off B&#039;way and 38th st. <br /><br />Good luck! Regardless of where you choose to go, even if it&#039;s a class at the NYSC, you&#039;re not too far from the many choices available here.<br />

				Yoga Agora, hands down. I&#039;ve tried a few places, and they are worth the short train trip.
