				Leaving out of Newark Airport for a 11:30am flight on a Friday morning.&nbsp; How would you guys get there from Astoria/LIC?&nbsp; I&#039;m thinking subway to WTC, then the PATH to Newark/Penn Station (not NY&#039;s Penn Station/33rd Street) and get the NJ AirTrain from there to the airport.<br /><br />Basically I&#039;m asking if anyone has tried this before and any advice they&#039;d have.&nbsp; I was also thinking car service, which would be pricier, for sure, but maybe easier.&nbsp; Your thoughts?<br /><br /><br />

				I use Newark Airport a lot for international flights.&nbsp; Mostly because I hate the ordeal it is to get to JFK, and the fact that flights are cheaper to Newark - and heck so is the transportation.&nbsp; Besides the New Jersey transit train right to the airport which is really easy, there is also a bus that will take you from Port Authority on a 20 minute ride to the airport as well.&nbsp; I would recommend both options.&nbsp; http://www.coachusa.com/olympia/ss.newarkairport.asp

				I&#039;ve taken both the train and the bus. The bus has been faster in my experience, and I like having to only make one transfer.

				Thanks Mckenna, I had checked that link and was thinking about that way too, but I&#039;m going to go with the bus route that daisy and 60decibels mentioned.&nbsp; <br /><br />I especially like the one transfer option.&nbsp; I&#039;m one stop out of Grand Central in LIC and then to just hop on the bus there to get to Newark Airport is ideal.<br /><br />Of course, if anyone else wants to chime in, they&#039;re more than welcome, but the bus seems to be the kind of deal I was looking for when I posted my question.<br /><br />Thanks all.<br />

				I agree - I need to go to Newark to fly out next week - suggestions would indeed be appreciated, but so far I was just planning on taking the subway and then that Airtran thing, does that seem right?&nbsp; But how long will all that take?

				Simplest way is the bus from grand central. I think it&#039;s 15, 20 bucks - leaves from park ave just across 42nd street. all those train transfers, stairs etc can&#039;t be much fun with bags... i believe they also go to jfk from there...

				Yes, I agree.&nbsp; That same bus leaves from Port Authority as well - quick and painless shot out of Manhattan to Newark.&nbsp; http://www.coachusa.com/olympia/ss.newarkairport.asp (http://www.coachusa.com/olympia/ss.newarkairport.asp)

				Make that three agreed -- take the bus. It&#039;s much easier than the NJ transit/PATH/Air train

				FYI, the Newark Airport Airtrain closes from 2:00 AM - 6:00 AM, if you&#039;re planning on traveling late at night. I forget how we got out of there that night, I just remember the cabs wanting too much and it being a drag.
