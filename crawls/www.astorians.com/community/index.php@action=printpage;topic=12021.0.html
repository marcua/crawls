				QUEENS–An Astoria landlord has been charged with stealing the identity of one of his tenants in order to obtain a $32,000 car loan and to open a credit card account that incurred more than $20,000 in debts, including bills for his telephone and EZ Pass.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Phivos C. Ioannou, 47, of 79-19 21st Avenue, in Astoria, Queens, was arraigned Wednesday night before Queens Criminal Court Judge William M. Harrington on a complaint charging him with one count of second-degree grand larceny and three counts of first-degree identity theft. Ioannou, who faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted, was released without bail and ordered to return to court on Sept. 30.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />An investigation was commenced by detectives from the New York City Police Department’s 114th Precinct Detective Squad following a complaint from the victim, Jorgji Glekas, 48, after she received bills in the mail that did not correspond to any accounts that she was aware of having opened. Glekas also told police that Ioannou, her landlord, subsequently began asking her if she had received any mail that did not belong to her.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />District Attorney Richard Brown said that, according to the complaint, Ioannou is accused of taking a $32,450 loan from Capitol One Auto Finance last year. He allegedly used the funds to purchase a 2004 BMW X5. The loan was issued in the name of Jorgji Glekas, using the victim’s Social Security number and date of birth. Capitol One records show that a payment on the loan was made last July with a check signed by “Ioannou Phivos.”<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Furthermore, according to the complaint, a Bank of America Visa credit card account was opened last May in the name of Jorgji Glekas. Records indicate that $20,310 in charges were made on the account, including more than $4,000 at Queenie Boutique, located at 37-18 31st Avenue, in Astoria.&nbsp; Ioannou, according to the complaint, admitted he is the owner of the boutique.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Other charges were allegedly made to pay for Ioannou’s EZ Pass and Verizon service. It is also alleged that payments were made to Zen Realty, Inc., where Ioannou admitted he is employed. Ioannou, according to the complaint, admitted that he used Jorgji Glekas’ name and personal information to open the various accounts.&nbsp; &nbsp; 8-29-08<br /><br />

				Thanks for sharing, hayleyree. What publication is that from? <br /><br />Now would be a good time to remind everyone to check their credit activity, not just their score. When my identity was stolen and used to start a small business in the Bronx, it took a lot of phone calls, letter writing, Internet research, and just waiting, to get the bad credit off.&nbsp; <br /><br />We&#039;ve had discussions in the past about where to get the free credit scores and a more detailed report, for a fee, but I just posted the link, again.<br /><br />https://www.annualcreditreport.com/cra/index.jsp<br /><br />

				Not that this applies to this particular situation, but there are a lot of people that are feeling a pinch right now and might do things that they never thought that they were capable of....that said, you really can never be too careful or too aware of who has access to your personal info.

				The worst part about this guy is that he is lucky enough to own a business and has a building and a job and still feels the need to steal.

				Thanks for providing that link, Astoria Luv.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t find any accounts open that weren&#039;t mine, but found it odd that one of my former addresses was incorrect.&nbsp; It says I lived at an address in a town I never lived in.&nbsp; I&#039;ll definitely be calling tomorrow.
