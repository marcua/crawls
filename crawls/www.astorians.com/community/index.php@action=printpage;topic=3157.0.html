				The rain is bad, and I&#39;ve been cooped up in my apartment for most of the last week with bronchitis.&nbsp; :| I&#39;ve done half of the little projects I&#39;ve been wanting to do for a long time (cleaned and re-organized my kitchen drawers, yay!), and am fairly well dreading the other half of the projects... Yeah, yucky week(end)... Hopefully everything will be sunnier next week.

				Yeah it&#39;s kind of nice to have a weekend where I can stay in and get some things done (cleaning, organizing) which I&#39;ve needed to do and haven&#39;t. However, I have yet to get to any of those things! If I could just get myself offline...<br /><br />I do like that it&#39;s getting cooler, makes me look forward to fall. But I&#39;m not really quite ready for summer to be over - I&#39;d like to get in several more sunny warm summer days in yet! Even though school starts soon, summer isn&#39;t officially over til September 22!

				Maybe I&#39;m in the minority but I really do like the rain. It&#39;s amazing to have a house that&#39;s 70 degrees after all the heat/brownouts we&#39;ve had this summer. It feels great to me!<br /><br />Oh wait, I know the real reason I&#39;m so content and happy. The Harley&#39;s aren&#39;t out riding!!&nbsp; :lol:

				I already miss summer actually. &nbsp;It&#39;s going by so fast. &nbsp;I don&#39;t like fall because it only reminds me winter is coming. &nbsp;And I hate winter. &nbsp;Brrr!!!&nbsp; I like 80 degrees all year round.&nbsp; Would move, but I love nyc too much....<br /><br />I&#39;m finally done with my test, can relax now! &nbsp;The birdies have taken refuge from the rain in my balcony! &nbsp;It&#39;s so cute!

				I spent the whole yucky weekend camping on Fire Island.&nbsp; It was neat that the weather was cool and there weren&#39;t many people around.&nbsp; Not so neat was the bottom of my sleeping bag getting wet when I forgot the close a vent before taking a nap.&nbsp; :-P<br /><br />I would have liked to have gone swimming but it was really nice to just look at the ocean and walk through the nature trails.&nbsp; Plus I saw lots of adorable pygmy deer.&nbsp; <br />:smitten:

				I actually went out and did a little shopping. It&#39;s perfect for shopping if you can stand going out, because the stores are pretty uncrowded. <br /><br />but, yeah, it&#39;s miserable out there. Bleh. I&#39;m watching &quot;you&#39;ve got mail&quot; on TBS for the millionth time.

				I heard the news saying that it wasn&#39;t as bad as they expected, saw a little light rain, and decided to venture out for some Papa&#39;s Empanadas and a bank-and-errands run.<br /><br />I got as far as Steinway waiting to catch the Steinway bus, and the skies decided to open up as Mother Nature smote me.&nbsp; I finally wound up clutching my mega-strong umbrella and dashing for the bus going the other way to take me home.<br /><br />Delivery sounds good right about now, though it&#39;d have to be a good tip in this weather...<br /><br />I want a cat to pet!!!!

				I am up in CT this weekend - a friend was supposed to have a big party on the beach today, but it got canned because of the weather, so now I&#39;m hanging out feeding and walking my sisters dog (she and my parents are out of town). I&#39;m gonna have some friends over tomorrow for burgers on the grill and whatnot, although we might end up just hanging out inside and playing board games, which is fine with me. Yay scrabble!

				I&#39;ve been cooped up in the Bronx, cat-sitting for my sister and her husband. Not so bad- they&#39;ve got a HUGE apartment and a fully-stocked bar&nbsp; 8-) unfortunately I&#39;ve gotta feed my own kitty cat.<br /><br />The wind gusts are making me nervous, though. Maybe my roommate is still around and won&#39;t mind putting some food out....then I can hunker down, order take-out and make a nice margarita&nbsp; :crazy:
