				I don&#039;t know if any of you fellow CSA members have noticed, but we get a lot of green beans. As much as I like green beans, I am just completely out of ideas for them.<br /><br />I have dressed them up with lemon and rosemary, sauteed them with mustard seeds, made salade nicoise, and tossed them with butter and toasted almonds. Mostly I just eat them plain, steamed, on the side of whatever else I&#039;m eating.<br /><br />What do you do with your green beans?

				You can always blanch and freeze them, and delay your quandry until January...!<br /><br />Yes, the crop has been ridiculously productive this year! Here&#039;s a really tasty dish I made recently:<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">Roasted Green Beans with Cherry Tomatoes<br /><br />From Fineliving.com.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * 1 lb. green beans, tipped and tailed<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * 1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * 1/4 c pumpkin seeds<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * 1/2 c basil leaves, cut into thin strips<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * 1/4 c XV olive oil<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * 1 T sherry wine vinegar<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * salt and pepper<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;1. Preheat oven (or for a half recipe, a toaster oven) to 375 degrees. In a dry skillet on low, toast pumpkin seeds until puffing up and browning, then remove from heat.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;2. Toss green beans in olive oil and some salt and pepper and spread them out on a baking sheet. Roast in oven for 30-35 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;3. Transfer to a large mixing bowl and toss with cherry tomatoes, basil and pumpkin seeds.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;4. Season to taste with vinegar, salt and pepper. Serve warm or room temperature.<br /><br />Serves 6.</code><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=7972.msg93262.html#msg93262">Quote from: melon on September 19, 2007, 10:39:02 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I don&#039;t know if any of you fellow CSA members have noticed, but we get a lot of green beans.

				Beans with pesto!&#160; With last week&#039;s batch, I cooked them with scallions, minced poblano (both from the share), and pesto made from the basil share.&#160; I sauteed the sliced scallions and poblano first in a little olive oil, then added the beans to heat them through (I boil them for 7 minutes and then shock them - they are cooked through but still a little al dente at that point, which works nicely for quick sauteeing).&#160; I added enough pesto to coat a minute or so before the end.

				That pesto sounds good.&nbsp; I also blanch and freeze - I did it last year and was sooooo glad that I did!&nbsp; Nice to have good, organic green beans in the middle of winter.

				I posted this to Astoria CSA&#039;s website. It&#039;s a dipping sauce that is *so* good (with any of the veggies). I adapted the recipe from Gourmet:<br /><br />1 cup plain yogurt<br />juice of 1/2 a lemon<br />1 clove garlic<br />5-6 anchovy fillet<br />pepper to taste<br /><br />Blanch green beans for 30 seconds in boiling water (or even eat them raw theyâ€™re so tender!). In a small skillet on medium heat warm anchovy with garlic. Sautee and break down anchovy fillet for about 1 minute, until garlic begins to brown and a paste forms. While anchovy-garlic is warming put yogurt and lemon juice in a bowl, mix. Add anchovy-garlic and pepper, mix to incorporate.<br /><br />(The version in Gourmet used sour cream and mayo instead of yogurt. I think the yogurt was fine and tasted great.)<br /><br /><br />Also, I made gnocchi in a mushroom cream sauce with green beans. Was delicious... (but used milk instead of cream!)

				I made green bean casserole a few weeks ago and it was pretty good.<br /><br />I love beans, too, but I find that they are time-consuming to make (all the washing, etc.). Perhaps I&#039;m just lazy.
