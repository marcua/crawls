				My phone has been ringing everyday now for a week. When I pick it&#039;s an automated caller talking about alternative energy and something about having only a limited time to apply for stimulus package. I then hang up. I have Con Ed but these calls are so annoying. I even registered my number on the Do Not Call list. What can I do to stop these calls?

				Report them to the better business bureau.&nbsp; &nbsp;Its illegal for them to call you once you say you dont want call anymore .&nbsp; &nbsp; People used to leave flyers on my doorstep and i put a sign up that said no flyers . They continued&nbsp; , so i reported the business and they were finded $250.&nbsp; Never got another flyer again .

				In general these types of phone calls mirror spam or phishing on the internet.&nbsp; There is apparently a way of hacking into a phone<br />line telephone number, etc.&nbsp; The local telephone companies that check would sometimes show the number as being one that is currently out of service.<br /><br />For the most part these are rogue or scam enterprises, and following the do not call act is the least of their misconduct<br /><br />Talking to them just verifies that your phone number is viable and they can use that information<br /><br />And if you talk to them, you have established a relationship so they can call you again under the law.&nbsp; (I had one that claimed that by answering the phone I established a relationship, another that claimed that they don&#039;t know that I am under the do not call act unless they call.<br /><br />They are one of the myriad foul stenches of our modern life, they won&#039;t go away, so just don&#039;t breath heavily &lt;grin&gt;<br /><br />
