				&nbsp;:rolleyes:&nbsp; &nbsp;beware the buzz word &quot;swanky&quot;. In Astoria? I mean, no issues with the project if that&#039;s your cup of tea- but as the commenter in the article says, people going to a &#039;Sports Bar&quot; aren&#039;t exactly looking for high end Greek food... If you can&#039;t provide wings, beer and burgers you will limit your clientele. And then trying to make it a triple threat with a sports bar in front, restaurant in back, AND a swanky VIP in the basement?

				Wow, this place sounds insane. I can&#039;t imagine how much money they&#039;re sinking in to this place and it sounds like it&#039;s going to miss the mark of the neighborhood&#039;s demographics by quite a bit. I get it that they&#039;re trying to go after the 20 and 30 somethings who have just moved here but they should have skewed a little less Long Island if that&#039;s the case. As a business move, somewhere like Sparrow, Sweet Afton, the Strand, or Bareburger would have done better than somewhere like Canz or Cavo which don&#039;t really cater towards the way the nightlife in Astoria is headed. They&#039;ll have a bunch of people driving in from Long Island to go here and it&#039;ll be cabs and craziness outside of it every night the way that Don Coqui is with people coming in from everywhere but the local neighborhood to go there and party.

				If you dont like the sports type bar&nbsp; then just dont go . Plenty of other places around that dont have TVs or sports showing . And i do believe Cavo is making a killing and has done so for plenty of years so they must be catering to a wanting crowd .&nbsp; &nbsp;The reason Don Coquis is all people coming in from other places(bronx) is cuz its all Puerto Ricans .&nbsp; &nbsp;The music and scene isnt gonna appeal to alot of people here but they did make the place really nice&nbsp; so people from other places come in .<br />&nbsp;<br />I still dont get why the world crumbling would stop anyone from watching sports if they want &gt;?&nbsp; &nbsp;What does one have to do with the other ?&nbsp; and like someone else said ,&nbsp; maybe sports is a peacefull medium ....unless you are a Mets fan ofcourse , then its always pain in the end .

				I definitely would have preferred the books store/coffee shop or sweet afton-esq kind of place there, but I&#039;m just glad OTB is gone and the space is being used. And hey, if it ends up being a good place to dance, that&#039;s one more reason not to have to go into Manhattan.

				There is another Don Coqui in New Rochelle so I&#039;m not sure the customers in Astoria are mostly from the Bronx.&nbsp; I don&#039;t hang out at Don Coqui for the music or dancing, but I definitely think the food is quite good.&nbsp; And they&#039;re very good with take-out orders if you&#039;re right off the train and pass them on the way home.&nbsp; Very good latin style steaks and fish dishes.&nbsp; And nice people.&nbsp; I personally think it&#039;s a step up from the old Zodiac which was a bit more exclusive, in the not-so-good way.&nbsp; And it&#039;s funny about the sports bars.&nbsp; I can remember people complaining that Astoria had so few regular bars that showed American sports.&nbsp; And not we are on the verge of having too many.&nbsp; Funny how things change over the course of a few years.

				Their Facebook page indicates they like to throw private parties. So maybe that&#039;s what&#039;s been going on. I hope they open to the public soon and don&#039;t remain a pseudo private club for much longer.

				I pretty much agree with smiddlem.&nbsp; We stopped in yesterday just to see what it was like inside.&nbsp; Granted, HUGE crowd for Sunday Football, so it was very busy and noisy.&nbsp; I agree that the atmosphere is clubby and Vegas-like.&nbsp; And I&#039;d agree that I may not go in very often at all, BUT...I was very impressed and very glad to see people enjoying it.&nbsp; I asked a very down-to-earth guy smoking out front what he thought and he was beaming and said he was having the greatest time.&nbsp; There was a steady stream of people going in.&nbsp; From the looks of it, it&#039;s wildly popular already!&nbsp; I&#039;m happy to see it and thrilled that OTB is gone for good.&nbsp; I consider this a great addition to the Ditmars area.&nbsp; I&#039;m not a die-hard sports fan to start with, but Katch is a bit more my speed and less with the club/mirrors vibe.&nbsp; I think Sweet Spot could seem less welcoming to some people, but it will not hurt their business in the least.&nbsp; I might add that I looked across the street and both Ditmars Station and O&#039;Hanlons were also crowded for Sunday football, so it goes to show that Sweet Spot is meeting a demand and not killing business for others.

				I love to dance and am wondering if they have dancing at this place, since people have said the music is very loud.&nbsp; From what people have said, it doesn&#039;t make sense to me that they play the music so loud that people can&#039;t hear the sound on the tvs?&nbsp; Isn&#039;t this supposed to be a sports &quot;lounge&quot;?&nbsp; From what I read it seems they are catering more to the people who like to listen to music, but then again, if the music is too loud, it might even be too loud for the people who like listening to it.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think I would feel comfortable walking in this place by myself.&nbsp; It sounds very intimidating to me.&nbsp; So far I have read more negative things about it than positive.

				You can dance where u stand or sit , but there is no dance floor . Almost no one in Astoria other than a couple of places i know have a cabaret license where you can actually dance legally . Yea it sounds stupid , but the place needs a special license to allow its patrons to dance and say it has a dance area . MAny clubs years ago were raided by the club police&nbsp; , which has recently been phased out due to budget cuts&nbsp; and have gotten tickets for people dancing in their bars , lounges cafes .&nbsp; They actually had to put up signs that read &quot;please refrain from dancing &quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;It was like something out of FootLoose .&nbsp; &nbsp;I guess after some time , the club owners took down their stupid signs and now dancing isnt a big deal .&nbsp; Still no dance floors though in any places like Cavo , Central&nbsp; ,Caprice&nbsp; &nbsp;etc etc

				I&#039;m not into sports, but I have gone to Ditmars Station, which is right across the street from Sweet Spot and I have found this place to be very pleasant.&nbsp; You could sit at the bar and have a drink and the music that&#039;s playing is at a comfortable sound level.&nbsp; The people who work there are very friendly and make me feel comfortable when I go there.&nbsp; I&#039;ll probably stick with this place if I want a drink.&nbsp; But I still would like to check out Sweet Spot for myself to see how loud the music really is.&nbsp; When I go out I like to hear music but if I&#039;m with someone and want to have a conversation and feel that I have to yell so they could hear me, then in my opinion, the music is too loud.&nbsp; Music should only be loud if you&#039;re in a club dancing.

				I&#039;m not all that much into watching sports in a bar either.&nbsp; The music was really too loud and there were several football games going on, even if they were college games and there was no break in the music at all.&nbsp; &nbsp;Had to raise my voice and the peeps I was with had to turn their heads so I was directly speaking into their ears.&nbsp; <br /><br />And too &quot;hip-hoppy&quot; was the nicest way I could think of to describe the type of music it was.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t laced with profanity or the &quot;the N word,&quot; but it had that thug feel/sound to it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Katch is closer anyways and they have a better music AND beer selection.&nbsp;

				We tried it out on a Friday evening around 7/8.&nbsp; It was not that loud or playing hip hop music at that point but I have no doubt it would later on.&nbsp; I saw the outfits on the waitresses.&nbsp; Definitely going for a sexy look but I actually didn&#039;t think they were trashy.&nbsp; I was impressed with the bourbon and whiskey selection.&nbsp; My buddy thought the beer menu was pretty interesting and balanced.&nbsp; I really like what they did with the space.&nbsp; The bridge to the rear dining area is cool and I like that they retained the Off Track Betting lettering.&nbsp; They use lighting and textures very well.&nbsp; Whoever designed the space shows skill and talent.&nbsp; The restrooms are spacious and clean.&nbsp; I would go back for sure, but I would not go late night, nor would I go in the height of a big game.&nbsp; More like a happy hour and try a burger or sandwich plate and just relax.&nbsp; I completely agree about the differences between Katch and Sweet Spot.&nbsp; I like Katch and I think their food is quite delicious.&nbsp; But I think Sweet Spot can be cool if you&#039;re in the mood for something a little darker and more loungy.&nbsp; Both seem very popular and that&#039;s good news for Astoria in general.

				I was at Mosaic a couple weeks ago, and was surprised to see a giant screen playing a football game. The volume was off, but it was sort of strange and imposing -- that place is otherwise so elegant and velvet couchy and... I dunno. Girly? In a good way. Just the last place I&#039;d expect to have football playing with my fancypants wine.<br /><br /><br />The giant multiple TVs thing in non sportsbar places (especially upscale-seeming restaurants) really baffles me, but seems like such a &#039;thing&#039; in Astoria! Really a huge turnoff, but maybe I am not the target audience anyway.

				Hm, I was in Mosaic less than a week ago and didn&#039;t notice any screens. I know they do screen TV shows (Breaking Bad, Mad Men), so I&#039;m guessing they just turn it on for special events? It doesn&#039;t seem like the right venue for football, but at least it&#039;s not on all the time. I agree, Mosaic has a great atmosphere.

				I cant see any man being offended by women wearing little clothing . These girls seem to be in great shape and take care of themselves , at the same time they need to make money and its pretty much proven , the less they wear , the more they will make in those types of jobs . Thats why they do it .

				There&#039;s an interesting conversation going on on their facebook page. Apparently they posted that they would now be requiring a strict dress code, with no hats or hoodies or oversized jackets, etc. People are upset. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s a move to keep the troublemakers out. If they wanted to do that, they could start by turning down the music.

				Its there Braun. Saw it late last night. Like 47 comments mostly negative.&nbsp; The owner replied a couple of times abt why they play hip hop and how&#039;s its a stereotype&nbsp; to think everyone who listens to it is a thug yet he won&#039;t allow sports caps&nbsp; cuz clearly he thinks the look looks thuggish&lt;&lt;&lt;&nbsp; smh &gt;&gt;&gt;

				Here was the original posting about the dress code.&nbsp; &nbsp;Unfortunately I did not save any of the comments, just capped this to send to a friend. <br /><br />I definitely got the &quot;if you don&#039;t like it, you can f...requent another establishment&quot; vibe from the owners posts. <br />

				It seems to me that the owner is trying to do another version of Cavo, but with sports as the central theme (while the &quot;bar&quot; is really meant to be a club).&nbsp; The thing is that the Ditmars area has a greater mix of families that the south side of Astoria, so I&#039;m not sure how popular such a place will be.&nbsp; It&#039;s a fairly large space, so they&#039;re going to need a steady and large regular crowd to fill it and make it pay.&nbsp; From what I&#039;ve seen thus far, I&#039;m not sure they are getting that kind of traffic.
