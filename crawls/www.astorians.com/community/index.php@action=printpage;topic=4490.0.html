				Has anyone on this board spent any time in Mexico City?&nbsp; We&#39;re going there.&nbsp; Would love to hear some recommendations (musuems, art galleries, food, side trips, etc.), or any other advice people might have for this amazing and chaotic place...

				I really recommend taking a day trip to Teotihuacan, the pre-Aztec city. I think it&#39;s about a 40 min-1hr drive. It was totally amazing.<br /><br />The Zocalo is cool. Though I would be careful going there, especially at night. The Aztec temple ruins next to the cathedral is a must-see. I heard good things about the archeological museum, too.<br /><br />There&#39;s a hip neighborhood that has boutiques and cafes, even a Starbucks, but I wish I could remember the name. Condessa, maybe but dont&#39; quote me on htat.<br /><br />The food was great just about anywhere and my favorite was chilequiles which are made in tons of different wasys. Careful of eating raw greens because of the water they get wahsed in , thougn most upper-scale restaurants wash their vegetables in purified water.<br /><br />You&#39;re right in saying MC is a chaotic place. Getting around is nothing like New York or any other major city I&#39;ve been to. It took me 4 hours to go 2.5 kilometers by bus because of a mass protest/riot. The pollution was a probelm for me when I was there, giving me sore throats and stuff. Crime is a big problem there too.
