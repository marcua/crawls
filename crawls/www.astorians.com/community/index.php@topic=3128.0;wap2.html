			<strong>gemron77</strong>:
			<br />
			I&#39;m trying to find an apartment in Astoria, but&nbsp; A. don&#39;t want to pay a broker fee and B. am not entirely sure I&#39;m going to find a 1 BR or large studio in my price range in the area I want to stay in.&nbsp; <br /><br />My current lease runs out October 15, so I&#39;d prefer something that starts on that date so I&#39;m not overlapping on rent, but I could probably manage to do October 1 if there&#39;s no broker fee.<br /><br />Do you know of any place between Astoria Blvd &amp; Broadway (28th St to Steinway) that&#39;s $1,100 or less?&nbsp; I also have two very well-behaved cats, so they have to allow small pets. <br /><br />Are you or any of your friends moving?<br /><br />Feel free to forward this request to anyone in the neighborhood.&nbsp; I can be reached either via e-mail through the message board.<br /><br />Thanks!
