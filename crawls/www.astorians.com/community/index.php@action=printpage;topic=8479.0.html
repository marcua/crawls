				My website is up and running and you can order coffee online.<br /><br />http://www.organic-cup-a-joe.com/OrGaniCJoE.html<br /><br />I&#039;m starting off with two coffees, one is decaf, both organic.<br /><br />I have a couple of organic stores that are selling them but it&#039;s cheaper if you buy them directly from me on the internet.<br /><br />This coffee really is good.&nbsp; If you buy it and don&#039;t like it, I&#039;ll refund your money.

				I am BUT before I can afford to buy more variety I have to make some money.<br /><br />The other Blends that I will have will be:<br /><br />Costa Rica<br />Mexico<br />Africa<br /><br />To name a few<br /><br />I&#039;m also planning to add organic tea and organic snacks. <br /><br />Right now I&#039;m a baby in diapers (cloth diapers!).<br /><br />NOTE:&nbsp; It&#039;s better if you order it directly through me and avoid the shipping charges.&nbsp; I will deliver it to you myself if you&#039;re in Astoria or close.<br />

				Ooh, very interested!&nbsp; I was going to ask this in a PM, but I thought others might be interested as well:&nbsp; who does the roasting, and where?&nbsp; How often is it roasted?

				Thanks for the link - that&#039;s really interesting, and good to know.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t really answer my question, though.&nbsp; I&#039;ll try to rephrase -- do you by the beans green and do the roasting yourselves, or do you buy it already roasted?&nbsp; If you buy it roasted, is it roasted at your request and to your specifications, and do you know how long it&#039;s roasted before you get it?&nbsp; In other words, do you have any control over the roasting process?<br /><br />My questions don&#039;t mean I won&#039;t give it a try -- I&#039;ll probably be contacting you soon to do just that.&nbsp; I am curious, though, to learn more about how your coffee is roasted.

				I do not buy the beans green and roast them myself, my supplier does that.&nbsp; <br /><br />I did a lot of research before picking them and tasted a lot of samples from different distributors.&nbsp; Below is an excerpt of how they explain their roasting process:<br /><br />&quot;As one of the original Micro-Roasters on the Internet, We have earned a reputation of offering the freshest, highest quality coffee in the world. Our coffee is made from the top 1% of Class 1 specialty coffee beans and are carefully hand-roasted in small &#039;micro&#039; batches and shipping the same day we roast it to all our customers. The difference in taste and quality between micro-roasting and other methods is like comparing fine gourmet food to cafeteria food. The quality, the preparation and the personal attention to the finest details is crucial is preparing great coffee.<br /><br />We only roast in small batches. By roasting in small batches, every batch is roasted to perfection and there is nothing left over to the following day. Freshness is everything. <br /><br /><br />We know that coffee tastes best right after roasting, so we are committed to delivering or shipping our freshly roasted coffees immediately after the order has been completed. We often ship our coffees by next day Air all over the world. That is fresh and our customer do not mind paying a premium for great coffee.&quot;<br /><br />I hope this answers your questions, if you have more please feel free to ask!!!&nbsp; <br /><br />...and thank you for your interest.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)<br />

				Thanks.&nbsp; Just keep in mind that what I have now is from East Timor.&nbsp; I want to sell some before I order more and I will be buying Costa Rican Organic Coffee.<br /><br />As a matter of fact why doesn&#039;t everyone let me know their preference and whichever one is the most requested, I&#039;ll order that one and name it &quot;Astorians Blend&quot;.<br /><br />How&#039;s that?

				&quot;Costa Rica coffee comes from central Costa Rica with coffee grown between 4,000 and 7,000 feet above sea level. The plantation enjoys a unique microclimate with the ideal growing combination of soil, temperature, sunlight intensity and wet season. The use of herbicides and pesticides is eliminated through the manual removal of weeds and the use of natural processes. <br /><br />The plantation also maintains a 200 acre tropical reserve forest furthering the delicate environment. . <br /><br />The coffee produced is referred to as a &quot;classically complete&quot; coffee -- a sweet aroma, full body, pleasant acidity and a delicate clean aftertaste with rich chocolate and nutty undertones.&quot;<br /><br />This is what my distributor writes, but I tasted their sample and it was really good, it has a very strong aroma, sort of a sweet nutty aroma.<br /><br />
