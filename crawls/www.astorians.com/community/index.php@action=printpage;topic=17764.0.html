				I want to take some time to answer this because Billz1981 and I touched on this in another thread and I want to explain myself in a better way here because I think it is important. <br /><br />I am very upset regarding the irrational attacks, verbal and otherwise, that I see occurring across the nation. And it&#039;s not just the signs of Obama with a Hitler mustache or the ones calling for an armed insurrection that would, I can only imagine, require an attack on Washington DC that will result in the destruction of the government. <br /><br />Yeah, some can consider that bombastic silliness that will never evolve into an actual revolution. And I can understand the feeling there. <br /><br />What upsets me is the reaction of GOP leaders that egg on the teabaggers. One example that jumps out is Sen Grassley talking about how Grandma isn&#039;t ready to die. How in all that is holy can a leading Senator make that statement? This is acceptable conduct? We have seen situations where GOP politicians are forced to apologize to Rush.....WTF? And we also had a GOP leader state that he understood the guy who flew a plane into a building that had IRS employees. Again....WTF. that action by that guy was an act of terrorism. How is it possible to excuse that action? I&#039;m sorry but I don&#039;t effing get it. How is this acceptable.<br /><br />What it seems to me is this. GOP politicians are fanning the flames to suit there own goals such as winning elections. But also, it seems to me that the GOP leadership is afraid to stand up to this insanity and say ENOUGH! <br /><br />But it is more than that. <br /><br />Last night, I watched the news with the examples of death threats, rocks thrown threw windows. And I cried. This is really scaring me. <br /><br />And it really hurts. I support health care reform because I want my fellow citizens to be safe from fear of being denied care. I don&#039;t want to see a single person die because an HMO decided that the operation was to expensive. I&#039;m not trying to destroy the Constitution. And neither is Obama or Pelosi or Reid. <br /><br />Let me end this way and ask this question. What if we don&#039;t survive this? What if someone finally takes the next logical step. What if someone assassinates a politician. I&#039;m sorry, but based on what I am seeing, I can&#039;t help but think that is what is next. How can I not?<br /><br />I&#039;m not writing this as an angry man. I&#039;m writing this as a fearful man. Fearful of the path we seem to be going down at this moment. <br /><br />

				Kemper, I have a modest suggestion. Leave the echo chamber. On a different thread you stated that you couldn&#039;t watch something because it was on Fox News. OK that&#039;s great. I trust very little that I see on talk shows. But by listening to the irrational rantings of Olberman or Maddow, or even worse, the Ed show you are just getting the other side of the marketing coin.<br />There are irrational people on both sides of the political aisle. Both sides threaten violence if they don&#039;t get their way. But, when you reflectively use the term &quot;teabagger&quot; you are contributing to the problem. You are mocking a legitimate concern (the government has too much say in free citizen&#039;s live) by throwing in a psuedo-sexual image to mock them. <br />So how about we address the issue. How much control should the federal government exert over free citizens? If I say that &quot;a government has no authority to mandate that I purchase a product from a third party&quot;, can you refrain from suggesting that I suck balls?<br />

				My sources tell me that &quot;tea party&quot; was originally &quot;TEA Party&quot; - &quot;Taxed Enough Already&quot;.&nbsp; I think it was an unfortunate convergence of ignorance and opportunity that &quot;teabagger&quot; was first used.&nbsp; I shake my head when thinking about it, for both sides.&nbsp; Anyway, I agree that when one tries to argue against ridicule and worse, using &quot;teabagger&quot; sort of defeats that.&nbsp; I also expect that some people do not use &quot;teabagger&quot; to mock or hurt anyone, as MSM has used that term enough throughout this whole thing to somewhat legitimize it.&nbsp; kempster comes off to me as a thoughtful guy and I&#039;m sure he didn&#039;t use the term as a dig.&nbsp; Anyway, those are my (off-topicish) thoughts, coming from a progressive even. :-o<br />&nbsp;:wink:

				For the record, there is a difference between the Tea Party and Teabaggers. The Tea Party is mostly comprised of Libertarians. The &quot;don&#039;t interfere with the way I want to live my life&quot; type people. Which, as a gay man, I understand. Teabaggers are the people that hold up misspelled signs comparing Obama to Hitler. <br /><br />Trust me, I know the difference. <br /><br />As far as the echo chamber goes, I watched all 11 hours of the House debate on Sunday on C-SPAN.....not MSNBC. Because I don&#039;t like to be told who I should think or see a political event by the MSM. I am someone that has a poliSci Degree. Hell, I explained to one professor what a legislative tree was (Bonus points to anyone who knows what I am talking about).<br /><br />I eat politics up like it is candy. I can still recall, vividly, an hour long speech by Sen Byrd comparing the US Senate to the Roman Republic Senate. So please don&#039;t say I am living in an echo chamber. This is s___ I passionately care about.

				I appreciate your thoughtful posting, kempsternyc. &nbsp;I&#039;m truly sorry that you feel as though you have to live in fear because of your political preferences. &nbsp;The people who use violence or the threat of violence to promote their cause are bullies, and when you fear them you give in to them. &nbsp;This is true of the small fringe of the Tea Party movement just as it is true of the fringe element of any protest group, be they anti-war, anti-globalization, environmentalists, etc. &nbsp;I honestly do not believe you should live in fear. &nbsp;Don&#039;t give them the satisfaction. &nbsp;If you are convinced that the health care reform package is the way to go, then proudly stand firm in that conviction, just as I stand in staunch opposition. &nbsp;The genius of America is that we are free to have those differences without mortal fear.<br /><br />That said, I do think it&#039;s a bit disingenuous of Democratic politicians to feign surprise and outrage at the response they are facing. &nbsp;While it is completely inappropriate to shout slurs at congresspeople as is allegedly happening, this represents but a tiny fraction when compared to the legitimate protest movement. &nbsp;There are going to be some bad apples in any batch of thousands of (understandably!) angry people. &nbsp;The Democratic politicians are grownups, they believe they are doing the right thing, and they should have the courage to stand by their vote. &nbsp;When you say that the stakes have been quietly and quickly raised, it&#039;s as though you are surprised that such a large and momentous legislative package would cause people to take notice. &nbsp;I worry that such an attitude comes from the well meaning failure to take a look at the other side. &nbsp;In other words, &quot;How could these guys be so pissed at this bill? &nbsp;It&#039;s empirically a good idea!&quot; &nbsp;Anyhow, regarding the threats against members of congress, I think the situation is being overstated. &nbsp;The cynic in me thinks that this is the old tactic (which both parties are guilty of) where you over sell something negative the opposition is doing for political gain. &nbsp;(http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0310/Embracing_the_freakshow.html) &nbsp;I think the real threat these guys face is in November.<br /><br />And although Debbie has already preempted me from using this example because apparently not enough minorities participate in the Tea Party movement, there are plenty of examples of other groups using violent imagery or even making the totally unjustified comparison between ANY U.S. leader of ANY party with the Nazis. (http://www.zombietime.com/hall_of_shame/) &nbsp;When the violent fringe of your own movement has engaged in the same tactics, you don&#039;t get to call out the other movement on their fringe.<br /><br />If, God forbid, some politician gets assassinated tomorrow, the country will move on just as it has in the past. &nbsp;It would be a horrible tragedy, but we have weathered such things before. &nbsp;Personally, I believe that is highly unlikely. &nbsp;You act as if all of this blind hatred towards our leaders is a dangerous new thing. &nbsp;But look at what Bush and his Republican colleagues contended with for years. &nbsp;None of them were assassinated. &nbsp;Weren&#039;t those who hated them just as vehement?<br /><br />And while I am speaking only for myself, I don&#039;t believe that President Obama and his colleagues are evil or deliberately attempting to undermine the constitution, I do believe that this reform package is of questionable constitutionally. &nbsp;And probably antithetical to the beliefs of the Founding Fathers. &nbsp;But I get that they are acting in what they think is in the best interests of the country.

				I think that only time will tell as to how violent this movement gets.&nbsp; It is my belief that there are many more of this fringe group who own guns vs. the masses that protested the Iraq war, although I may be wrong.&nbsp; And if a politician is assassinated yes, we will move on but I would certainly not be so blase about it as some seem to be.<br /><br />What makes me cringe are the slurs shouted at African American members of our government, some of whom have been through this before.&nbsp; Is it necessary to show the world our ugly rascist past (is it in the past?)?&nbsp; Even if someone is against this bill, why bring rascism into it?&nbsp; It does not matter that this is just one person out of hundreds, I have a feeling that the sentiment is still there - just been to the South and felt it myself.<br /><br />Is it unlikely that someone who is already angry at the world, has hatred in his / her heart, and hears &#039;messages&#039; from the far right picks up his / her gun and uses it?

Mary Jo Kilroy&#039;s district office last week.<br /><br />&quot;He&#039;s got every right to do what he did and some may say I did too, but what I did was shameful,&quot; Reichert said. &quot;I haven&#039;t slept since that day.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I made a donation (to a local Parkinson&#039;s disease group) and that starts the healing process.&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2010/03/24/dollar-bill-throw.html?sid=101 (http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2010/03/24/dollar-bill-throw.html?sid=101)<br /><br />ps.....that catching ones breath thing includes me too.

				Also in the Times this morning, an article (http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/28/weekinreview/28carey.html?ref=weekinreview) noting that anger against political events is pretty common, historically, but violence coming out of those protests is fairly sporadic and uncommon.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Even those who see an underlying racial element in today’s political anger don’t suggest that these extreme conditions apply.<br /><br />Furthermore, the psychological distance between talk and action — between fantasizing about even so much as brick heaving and actually doing it — is far larger for a typical, peaceable citizen than many assume. In the aftermath of the July 2007 London subway bombings, for instance, polls found that about 5 percent of Muslims living in England said that they believed violence was justified in defense of Islam. “That projects to about 50,000 Muslims in the U.K.,” Dr. McCauley said, “but very, very few of them are acting violently.”<br /><br />Kathleen Blee, a sociologist at the University of Pittsburgh, said the same was true even for groups that consider violence a central tenet. “In the white power groups I study, people can have all kind of crazy racist ideas, spend their evenings reading Hitler online, all of it,” she said, “but many of them never do anything at all about it.” </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				What I can add to all this, is that there is a right way and a wrong way to everything.<br /><br />The politicians opposing this reform are OBVIOUSLY spreading the fire.<br />There was just as much hate for Bush and his administration, with existing reasons to hate.<br />But never was there assassination threats, Bush posters with Hitler features, or even racism.<br /><br />What&#039;s scary is that of course there are always going to be two sides in any situation, but for it to get to this point, is beyond belief.<br /><br />We opposed Bush, and sadly could not stop him, and it was easy to receive our opposition.<br />How do you ask us to do the same when you&#039;re calling in threats, and holding bricks in your hands?<br /><br />How do politicians stay firmly to what the believe in, what they&#039;re only doing because they honestly believe it&#039;s to help the American people, when there families lives are at risk?<br /><br />The nonsense Team R has done in the last decade hasn&#039;t worked.

First, I don&#039;t know&nbsp; who threw bricks through windows, unlike say the WTO&nbsp; protests where the masked &#039;demonstrators&#039;&nbsp; take&nbsp; responsibility. I do know anti-Obama care bill signers were threatened , one being wished her accident last year had resulted in her death. I do know former&nbsp; President Bush, VP Cheney were&nbsp; threatened and so were&nbsp; Congress folks&nbsp; for years, who were&nbsp; following essentially the same&nbsp; strategy President Obama is&nbsp; in Afghanistan, difference&nbsp; is they didn’t publicize it or use it to&nbsp; go after the demonstrators. There was even an assassination film made about Bush and when anyone complained it was called ’guilt by association’ and ’McCarthyism’ to even question such vitriol’ and hatred, including attacks on Bush’s daughters in the press. These incidents&nbsp; have been happening for years, coming from the so-called ’anti-war’ side, but, most are not publicized in order to not further inflame the situation.&nbsp; I had my car vandalized&nbsp; twice in between 2003-2008, once a sticker&nbsp; with words ‘Pray For’ was scratched over with ‘F…‘ The&nbsp; Troops, and my tire slashed, shortly after the war began. After, the 2008 election my car sticker, McCain 2008, was ripped and Obama stickers were all over my car when I came out said&nbsp; ’Irish For Obama’, I was working the election and this happened near a polling station, which, if caught is a&nbsp; federal crime. I didn’t call the cops, make a media scene, but, for days after the election, the press focused on incidents that claimed&nbsp; people getting vandalized&nbsp; even beaten who were pro-Obama in NYC. There is&nbsp; no question there is&nbsp; a&nbsp; different&nbsp; feel presented by a&nbsp; press&nbsp; that hates&nbsp; people&nbsp; like me and more traditional folks,&nbsp; by focusing on&nbsp; what they are trying to present. Gun toting ‘whites’&nbsp; ready for a&nbsp; ‘race’&nbsp; war is an old tactic of&nbsp; all too many on the Left&nbsp; since the 1960’s&nbsp; to force through a radical left-wing agenda that gets&nbsp; the seal of&nbsp; approval of&nbsp; Fidel Castro, like our new health care plan just got this week.&nbsp; I attended a rally with ’tea bag’&nbsp; representation, and the veterans I attended with were of all colors, we couldn’t hold weapons within the city limits, only cops and criminals can do that in NYC, which is another story, but, several of the folks those who I know well, happen to be ’African’ American. When the media showed a rally of one gun toting, as they love to put it, ’tea bag’ demonstrator, they purposed edited out the fact that several others there were also African American. But, even if there were few people who the press has not called the approved ’minority’, why is it automatically ’racist?’&nbsp; Why isn’t say, something called the Congressional ’Black’ Caucus&nbsp; also deemed&nbsp; ’racist?’ These are questions I never get an answer to except some&nbsp; comment of the long racist history of the US, as if&nbsp; the USA, which did not exist and was a colony somehow&nbsp; invented&nbsp; it? I still have not seen, in this age of&nbsp; cell photos and 24/7 news,&nbsp; any conclusive evidence any of these so-called&nbsp; ‘racist’&nbsp; or&nbsp; ‘homophobic’ incidents&nbsp; took place.&nbsp; What I&nbsp; know about politics&nbsp; I know from both Left and Right, sadly, in my youth I was a Leftist. I guess it’s why like a former&nbsp; drinker, I am so&nbsp; vehemently opposed to their&nbsp; tactics and know that&nbsp; the many calls for ‘peace’&nbsp; and ‘justice’&nbsp; disguise an agenda of war&nbsp; and&nbsp; injustice. The left is&nbsp; now the establishment&nbsp; and like&nbsp; establishment, will present the other side as uneducated&nbsp; at best and&nbsp; dangerous&nbsp; at worst.&nbsp; In the end there already is violence&nbsp; to the truth and there has been vitriol and violence in the past&nbsp; from the side&nbsp; now claiming to be fearful&nbsp; of their&nbsp; fellow&nbsp; Americans. I wish those&nbsp; same folks were just as&nbsp; fearful and alert&nbsp; to what may soon be happening here, suicide&nbsp; bombers and&nbsp; folks with a real dangerous,&nbsp; agenda&nbsp; based on a&nbsp; perversion of a&nbsp; great religion. <br />

				I found this article in the NYTs this weekend that I think illustrates what I have been trying to say.<br />http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/28/weekinreview/28carey.html?ref=weekinreview (http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/28/weekinreview/28carey.html?ref=weekinreview)<br /><br />First off, This part highlights why I feel the way I do.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The risk that angry words themselves will incite violence is higher when they are aimed at a despised minority, or a feuding enemy, if history is any guide. The local press in many towns in the American South in the late 1800s and early 1900s played a role in inciting lynch mobs, for example. Inflammatory, racist propaganda on the radio station RTLM reportedly played a central role in the genocide in Rwanda in 1994, in which extremist Hutus slaughtered rival Tutsis.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />However, to illustrate what I believe highlights what Bill is trying to say.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">“As long as there is some possibility of getting results by political means, the chances that any group will turn truly radical are small, and maybe vanishingly small,” said Clark McCauley, a professor of psychology at Bryn Mawr College. But if those efforts to engage are thwarted, he said, the equation changes.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I encourage everyone to read this article fully.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Interesting<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Imagine that hundreds of black protesters were to descend upon Washington DC and Northern Virginia, just a few miles from the Capitol and White House, armed with AK-47s, assorted handguns, and ammunition. And imagine that some of these protesters —the black protesters — spoke of the need for political revolution, and possibly even armed conflict in the event that laws they didn’t like were enforced by the government? Would these protester — these black protesters with guns — be seen as brave defenders of the Second Amendment, or would they be viewed by most whites as a danger to the republic? What if they were Arab-Americans? Because, after all, that’s what happened recently when white gun enthusiasts descended upon the nation’s capital, arms in hand, and verbally announced their readiness to make war on the country’s political leaders if the need arose.<br /><br />Imagine that white members of Congress, while walking to work, were surrounded by thousands of angry black people, one of whom proceeded to spit on one of those congressmen for not voting the way the black demonstrators desired. Would the protesters be seen as merely patriotic Americans voicing their opinions, or as an angry, potentially violent, and even insurrectionary mob? After all, this is what white Tea Party protesters did recently in Washington.<br /><br />Imagine that a rap artist were to say, in reference to a white president: “He’s a piece of s___ and I told him to suck on my machine gun.” Because that’s what rocker Ted Nugent said recently about President Obama.<br /><br />Imagine that a prominent mainstream black political commentator had long employed an overt bigot as Executive Director of his organization, and that this bigot regularly participated in black separatist conferences, and once assaulted a white person while calling them by a racial slur. When that prominent black commentator and his sister — who also works for the organization — defended the bigot as a good guy who was misunderstood and “going through a tough time in his life” would anyone accept their excuse-making? Would that commentator still have a place on a mainstream network? Because that’s what happened in the real world, when Pat Buchanan employed as Executive Director of his group, America’s Cause, a blatant racist who did all these things, or at least their white equivalents: attending white separatist conferences and attacking a black woman while calling her the n-word.<br /><br />Imagine that a black radio host were to suggest that the only way to get promoted in the administration of a white president is by “hating black people,” or that a prominent white person had only endorsed a white presidential candidate as an act of racial bonding, or blamed a white president for a fight on a school bus in which a black kid was jumped by two white kids, or said that he wouldn’t want to kill all conservatives, but rather, would like to leave just enough—“living fossils” as he called them—“so we will never forget what these people stood for.” After all, these are things that Rush Limbaugh has said, about Barack Obama’s administration, Colin Powell’s endorsement of Barack Obama, a fight on a school bus in Belleville, Illinois in which two black kids beat up a white kid, and about liberals, generally.<br /><br />Imagine that a black pastor, formerly a member of the U.S. military, were to declare, as part of his opposition to a white president’s policies, that he was ready to “suit up, get my gun, go to Washington, and do what they trained me to do.” This is, after all, what Pastor Stan Craig said recently at a Tea Party rally in Greenville, South Carolina.<br /><br />Imagine a black radio talk show host gleefully predicting a revolution by people of color if the government continues to be dominated by the rich white men who have been “destroying” the country, or if said radio personality were to call Christians or Jews non-humans, or say that when it came to conservatives, the best solution would be to “hang ‘em high.” And what would happen to any congressional representative who praised that commentator for “speaking common sense” and likened his hate talk to “American values?” After all, those are among the things said by radio host and best-selling author Michael Savage, predicting white revolution in the face of multiculturalism, or said by Savage about Muslims and liberals, respectively. And it was Congressman Culbertson, from Texas, who praised Savage in that way, despite his hateful rhetoric.<br /><br />Imagine a black political commentator suggesting that the only thing the guy who flew his plane into the Austin, Texas IRS building did wrong was not blowing up Fox News instead. This is, after all, what Anne Coulter said about Tim McVeigh, when she noted that his only mistake was not blowing up the New York Times.<br /><br />Imagine that a popular black liberal website posted comments about the daughter of a white president, calling her “typical redneck trash,” or a “whore” whose mother entertains her by “making monkey sounds.” After all that’s comparable to what conservatives posted about Malia Obama on freerepublic.com last year, when they referred to her as “ghetto trash.”<br /><br />Imagine that black protesters at a large political rally were walking around with signs calling for the lynching of their congressional enemies. Because that’s what white conservatives did last year, in reference to Democratic party leaders in Congress.<br /><br />In other words, imagine that even one-third of the anger and vitriol currently being hurled at President Obama, by folks who are almost exclusively white, were being aimed, instead, at a white president, by people of color. How many whites viewing the anger, the hatred, the contempt for that white president would then wax eloquent about free speech, and the glories of democracy? And how many would be calling for further crackdowns on thuggish behavior, and investigations into the radical agendas of those same people of color?<br /><br />To ask any of these questions is to answer them. Protest is only seen as fundamentally American when those who have long had the luxury of seeing themselves as prototypically American engage in it. When the dangerous and dark “other” does so, however, it isn’t viewed as normal or natural, let alone patriotic. Which is why Rush Limbaugh could say, this past week, that the Tea Parties are the first time since the Civil War that ordinary, common Americans stood up for their rights: a statement that erases the normalcy and “American-ness” of blacks in the civil rights struggle, not to mention women in the fight for suffrage and equality, working people in the fight for better working conditions, and LGBT folks as they struggle to be treated as full and equal human beings.<br /><br />And this, my friends, is what white privilege is all about. The ability to threaten others, to engage in violent and incendiary rhetoric without consequence, to be viewed as patriotic and normal no matter what you do, and never to be feared and despised as people of color would be, if they tried to get away with half the s___ we do, on a daily basis.<br /><br />Game Over.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />

				That Tim Weiss piece has been sweeping the internet for a few weeks now.&nbsp; I can&#039;t count how many times I have seen it linked on Facebook and Twitter.&nbsp; It has certainly boosted his stature within his industry.&nbsp; Some of his &quot;facts&quot; are rather dubious, though.&nbsp; For example, there apparently exists no video or other proof that those members of congress actually were the target of racial epithets.&nbsp; Still his essay is a good exercise in singing to the choir.

I believe in a strong defense and even offense in some cases to prevent a&nbsp; wider problem later. I think abortion should be legal and adults should be able to marry anyone they want at the same time I think prayer should be allowed in schools and on and on. <br /><br />I think some of &#039;same terminology&#039; has been adopted by anti-govt leftist, so-called &#039;peace protesters,(http://libertyworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/bush_hitler.jpg) who supported/support huge violent communist regimes in the past century and now, but, all this has nothing to do with this guy. The people doing the most finger pointing about hate speech and bringing up 5 guys on radio and FOX News should look at their own glass house and wonder about their own contribution to &#039;hate&#039; and violence. <br /><br />I do recall, in this forum,&nbsp; how some of my threads pointing out real global dangerous violent&nbsp; militas and armies was met with derision and even calls of &#039;racism&#039;? But,&nbsp; pointing at people like me or others who happen to listen or watch more conservative progarmming as being responsible for a lone ill person is considered AOK and rational? It&#039;s not, it&#039;s wrong, and in my view UnAmerican. It would be just as bad as calling someone who believes in social justice as being in alliance with Stalin, Mao and Castro cause they use some of the same terminology.<br /><br />

				Ha Ha! Me too. &quot;It&#039;s not a gun! It&#039;s a weapon! A gun is what&#039;s in your pants!&quot; So said sergeant Smith to the male recruits at Fort Leonardwood--I&#039;ll never forget that statement. Really cracked me up. We learned to respect a firearm, how to take it apart and clean it piece by piece and put it back together again. We learned the importance of pointing it down range and not to wave it around possibly blowing someone&#039;s head off by accidentally pulling the trigger when it was loaded. Yeah, discipline is boring, but that&#039;s what a a gun owner/user needs to understand if he/she is allowed to have possession of a gun--- I mean firearm! Brings to mind &quot;The Deerhunter&quot;. There were 3 types of gunowners in that movie. One was the puny macho clown who liked to wave his pistol around and scare people with it, the other was a quiet, self disciplined hunter who&#039;s mantra was &quot;one shot&quot; to kill a deer, and the last was a self destructive type who definitely needed to be rescued from his inner demons and the handgun he used to eventually kill himself with. I think gun ownership shouldn&#039;t be anything but boring, aside from fun at the firing range or shooting competition or hunting.&nbsp; It&#039;s not a macho ego trip or an instrument to fulfill a desire to blow everyone away. Perhaps in Switzerland a Jared Loughner (if he was even allowed to walk on the streets) wouldn&#039;t have such easy access to guns. Maybe there&#039;s too laid back an attitude towards mentally unstable, dangerous individuals in our country.

				Ya know if you read the NY Times, you would think that the Texas Board of Education wants to remove Thomas Jefferson from the high school curriculum. Actually:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">According to Texas Freedom Network, a group that opposes many of the changes put in place by the Board of Education, the original curriculum asked students to &quot;explain the impact of Enlightenment ideas from John Locke, Thomas Hobbes, Voltaire, Charles de Montesquieu, Jean Jacques Rousseau and Thomas Jefferson on political revolutions from 1750 to the present.&quot;<br /><br />That emphasis did not sit well with board member Cynthia Dunbar, who, during Friday&#039;s meeting, explained the rationale for changing it. &quot;The Enlightenment was not the only philosophy on which these revolutions were based,&quot; Dunbar said. <br /><br />The new standard, passed at the meeting in a 10-5 vote, now reads, &quot;Explain the impact of the writings of John Locke, Thomas Hobbes, Voltaire, Charles de Montesquieu, Jean Jacques Rousseau, Thomas Aquinas, John Calvin and Sir William Blackstone.&quot;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I prefer the former, but if a Texas high school student could answer either, I think we&#039;ll be alright.<br /><br />I agree that politics should be kept out of school curriculum.

				The original exam question was not about the causes of “revolutions from 1750” it concerned the ideas of The Enlightenment and their influence, not specifically Jefferson so it’s a bit misleading to single out him out when the State of Texas in actuality would prefer the whole Enlightenment period, which emphasized science and reason, be dismissed.<br /><br />Cynthia Dunbar is correct in that The Enlightenment was not the only philosophy on which these revolutions (which one exactly?) were based but then she missed the point of the question, which looks to be deliberate. By her reasoning if the subject was “revolutions” and not “The Enlightenment” why not include the teachings of Marx, Hitler, or Mao? <br /><br />It’s not about heroes left or right, it’s about the dumbing down of ideas and promotion of a religious agenda.<br /><br />The reason why this matters is that the State of Texas buys textbooks on a state level and their curriculum dominates the subject material of books that are sold nationally.<br />

				James Taranto at the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> has a great column today about the violent rhetoric surrounding the labor siege in Wisconsin: http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703408604576164391424480436.html?mod=djemBestOfTheWeb_h<br /><br />He notes that SEIU has endorsed a new Dropkick Murphy&#039;s song written in support of Wisconsin labor, the lyrics of which include:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; When the boss comes callin&#039; we gotta organize<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Let em know<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; We gotta take the bastards down<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Let them know<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; We gotta smash them to the ground<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Let em know<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; We gotta take the bastards down<br /><br />Taranto also wryly cites Andy McCarthy who wrote in the National Review Online today &quot;public-sector employees work for us--they are not beaten down by &#039;the man,&#039;...&quot;
