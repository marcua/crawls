				i went to cafe bar yesterday for the first time.&nbsp; food was delicious and healthy, and not terribly expensive.&nbsp; the strange thing was.... i ate a decent sized meal (homemade chicken burger with side of mixed greens) and then said to my two girlfirends i was with, &quot;you know, i kind of feel like i&#039;m still hungry...&quot;&nbsp; they both said, &quot;yea, me too!&quot; and then one friend who goes regularly admitted that, &quot;i always kinda feel like that when i eat here.&quot;<br /><br />i feel like i&#039;d like to back for a coffee and a dessert, and dit outside and smoke and people watch, but probably not for a meal.&nbsp; except maybe brunch.&nbsp; i don&#039;t know... what does everyone else think of cafe bar?&nbsp; :roll:

				I had the Cypriot breakfast there yesterday - it was delicious, and I thought it was relatively healthy. $11. However, it took about 45 minutes and repeated requests to get our check. So don&#039;t go if you&#039;re in a rush.

				Yeah, us too.&nbsp; Practically everywhere I go now, even in Manhattan, it takes forever to get your check.&nbsp; Strange, these waiters have no rush to get paid.

				I&#039;ve had the appetizers and some smaller entrees there, but never the brunch.&nbsp; What&#039;s their brunch menu like?&nbsp; How large a selection and what type of items?

				I love Cafe Bar.&nbsp; I have brunch there all the time.&nbsp; The granola, yogurt, and fruit mix is the best!&nbsp; It can sometimes be a bit dirty inside, especially when you sit on the couches, but I still find myself going back for some reason! :-)

				I have to laugh at this post. As long as Cafe Bar has been open- maybe 8 or 9 years now (maybe longer??)- the one complaint that I have heard over and over is how ridiculously long it takes to get your check! I have just learned that if I am ever in a rush- Cafe Bar is NOT the place to go. Otherwise it is awesome. Very laid back vibe- great for people watching.

				I second what people&#039;ve said about the laid-back brunches and long wait time to get your check.&nbsp; If you&#039;re looking for filling, I also recommend the Cypriot breakfast.&nbsp; I think it cured a hangover of mine once too, although your mileage may vary.&nbsp; And if I remember correctly they have crepes too.&nbsp; It&#039;s a very decent place to lounge on a Sunday.

				As a matter of clarification, Cafe/Bar has been there ten years now.&nbsp; They&#039;ve done a wonderful job of making the place a community center, hosting local artists&#039; work, organizing a Community Supported Agriculture Co-op, introducing an organic menu to the neighborhood, and many other Progressively pro-active initiatives.&nbsp; The food has always been good and the service has always been slow.&nbsp; Always.&nbsp; Since Day One.&nbsp; One simply has to shift one&#039;s mental clock to &quot;Island Time&quot; before walking through their door.&nbsp; If you do that, you&#039;ll enjoy it much more.

				I think the brunch is great but, I agree, the service is really slow.&nbsp; Also, I think the coffee there sucks.&nbsp; I thought they had one bad day so I tried again and again, as I can&#039;t have brunch without coffee.&nbsp; It&#039;s just plain bad coffee.&nbsp; Anyone else find this?&nbsp; Still, that Brunch keeps bringing me back.&nbsp;

They agreed to let the CSA have the drop off there. BUT IN NOW WAY DID CAFE BAR ORGANIZE THE CSA. <br /><br />(as someone who did help start the CSA, I really had to make that clear). I love Cafe Bar, esp the Lebanese salad, but they were not part of the starting of the astoria csa.

We ordered drinks, hung out, tryed to look as mature as we could for 15 year olds. It hits maybe 10:15 and I had to be home by 11, so we ask for the check. Okay, 10 minutes later, still no check, so we ask again. By 10:50 we had asked about four times and still hadn&#039;t gotten the check, so I got fed up and walked out. I did leave the waitress a little note though, something like &quot;Since you didn&#039;t want to give us the check I guess that means our drinks are free, thanks&quot;. I haven&#039;t been back since.

				It really is the strangest thing.&nbsp; If I was making waiter pay, I&#039;d want my money and tips, and table turnover.&nbsp; It&#039;s like they just don&#039;t want the money.&nbsp; I&#039;ve contemplated leaving many times.&nbsp; But usually after my last adamant demand for the check, they finally bring it.&nbsp; But it doesn&#039;t make me want to leave a big tip for service.
