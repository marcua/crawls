				Astorians,<br />&nbsp; How about a new thread here to share recipes, for those of us that can actually cook and don&#039;t have to visit the great restaurants in NWQNZ to put together a great meal?<br />&nbsp; I know that I&#039;m always amazed at the wonderful aromas that I encounter in my building after coming home from work--I hope that I contribute to them. :-)<br />&nbsp; Tonight, I have a pork shoulder, trimmed of fat, that has been marinating in Mojo Criollo for three days and generously treated with a spice rub of my own device, roasting in my oven along with carrots, onions, and potatoes that have been brushed with olive oil and dusted with my own blend of Thai &quot;herbs and spices&quot;.<br />&nbsp; Does anyone else on this board, actually cook at home? <br />&nbsp; Please share your recipes.<br /><br />-= Astoristani :=-

				Vegetable soup, using a can of Progresso Cream of Mushroom + 1-1/2 cans of water, then maybe 1/2 cup half&amp;half and another 1/2 cup vegetable stock (wasn&#039;t really measuring anything.)<br /><br />Then some fresh broccolli, carrots, mushrooms (button and some shittake), and 1/2 can of corn. Added mustard/chili/onion powder and salt, and some curly pasta (not too much.) Quite good.<br /><br />Roasted the rest of the vegetables for an hour or so w/olive oil for later use.

				What&#039;s difficult is that I&#039;m mostly a vegetarian (except for fish) and the BF is a carnivore. He&#039;s a really good sport about my cooking, since he doesn&#039;t usually eat much dinner anyway, but I could use some recipes that mimic the taste of meat.

				Tonight&#039;s Special (and Tomorrow&#039;s Leftovers Special):<br />Mexican Black Bean Soup<br />Quick and easy to prepare. I make it with turkey kielbasa, but I&#039;m sure with Andouille sausage it&#039;s even better. I don&#039;t have canned chipotle, so I just dice some pickled jalapeños instead. Even with a little less beans it&#039;s still hearty.<br />http://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/mexican-black-bean-soup-with-sausage<br />

				I really love to make progresso lentil soup (vegetarian) and add pasta, I use ditalini, and in a small frying pan roast some garlic with olive oil, mix all together and you have an Italian lentils and macaroni dinner... as good as homemade but in much less time.

				Astorians,<br />&nbsp; It good to see that there are a lot of &quot;recombiners&quot; (my word :wink:) here--people that take pre-prepared products and recombine them into a totally different dish.&nbsp; I do this myself, since it&#039;s really time and cost efficient.<br />&nbsp; I&#039;m always reminds of the time when I was unemployed a few year back and when I lived on &quot;99 cent store&quot; chicken parmigiana and other delicacies. <br /><br />Recipe (serves six)<br /><br />1 99 cent store package of six frozen breaded chicken patties divided into individual portions<br />1 pkg 99 cent store imitation mozzarella cheese product divided into individual portions<br />1 jar 99 cent store spaghetti sauce <br />1 box 99 cent store spaghetti<br /><br />Boil the spaghetti<br />Cover the chicken patties with the imitation mozzarella cheese product and nuke until the faux cheese is melted<br />Plate the spaghetti, chicken patties, and sauce<br />Re-nuke until everything bubbles and smells delicious<br />Serve and enjoy!<br /><br />Total cost: $3.96&nbsp; Price per portion: $0.66 <br /><br />You can serve a great dish for six for the price of McDonald&#039;s &quot;Value Meal&quot;!&nbsp; :lol:<br /><br />But I digress...<br />To keep this on topic and Astoriacentric:<br />&nbsp;Tomorrow&#039;s lunch, made this evening--Roasted Cherry Peppers stuffed with double smoked bacon, goat cheese feta, and onion and garlic.<br /><br />&nbsp; Yesterday, I bought eight largish cherry peppers from Berry Farms and the rest of the ingredients came from&nbsp; either C Town and EuroMarket.<br /><br />Recipe: <br />Roasted Cherry Peppers stuffed with double smoked bacon, goat cheese feta, and onion and garlic.<br /><br />Cut off the top and stem of the cherry peppers (or any medium sized pepper of your choice)<br />Deseed and devein the pepper creating a hollow cavity<br />Line the inner wall of the pepper with Euromarket&#039;s double smoked bacon--one slice goes a long way<br />Insert goat cheese feta (also available at EuroMarket) into the cavity of the pepper<br />Press minced garlic and onion into the feta cheese<br />Place stuffed peppers on a cookie sheet and brush them with olive oil<br />Pop then into a pre-heated oven at 425F<br />Roast until the peppers are fork tender<br />Serve with Ajvar to taste and enjoy<br /><br />&nbsp; While, I&#039;m sure that this isn&#039;t an original recipe--it is a recipe that I developed by using ingredients that are locally available in Astoria.<br /><br />-=: Astoristani :=-<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				Great topic. This has been a busy time for home cooking.<br /><br />Eye round rubbed with paste (rosemary, garlic, lemon zest. salt, olive oil) sit overnight. Sear on all sides then low roast till 130F.&nbsp; Squeeze over 1 lemon and some more of the paste and olive oil. Let sit 15 min before carving. I like to add small chunks of onion and potatoes to pan while cooking.<br /><br />Flank steak with green rice and Peruvian green sauce.&nbsp; Oil and salt/pepper steaks overnight. Sear hard and finish in oven till rare. <br />For rice, puree some 1/2 onion, 4 clovegarlic, 1 bunch spinach, 1/2 bunch cilantro, oil. <br />Sautee till cook off water. Add 1 package Sazon or similar.&nbsp; Add more oil if needed. <br />Add rice and saute to coat with oil and color.&nbsp; Add water or chix stock. <br />Add 1cup green olives stuffed with pimento and 1 can pigeon peas.&nbsp; <br />Bring to boil uncovered then cover and reduce flame to simmer.<br /><br />PERUVIAN GREEN SAUCE (approx recipe)<br />2 cups iceberg lettuce<br />1/2 bunch cilantro<br />2 jalapenos. Seeded and deribbed<br />1/4 cup white vinegar<br />&nbsp;2 tablespoon mayonnaise<br />1/2 cup or less oil<br />1/2 medium onion<br />2 clove garlic<br />Juice of 1/2 lime<br />salt<br />a little bit of water (not a lot of water)<br />Combine ingredients in a blender. Adjust ingredients to taste.&nbsp; Surprisingly it is usually more lettuce that makes the taste work so well. Should be a bright lite green. Let sit for an hour and check heat. The jalapenos heat will build a bit over time.<br />Do not use food processor, will not give you correct smooth consistency.<br />Serve with steaks, roast chicken, anything.<br /><br />Rice onto platter, sliced steak over top with lime garnish. Serve sauce on side to spoon over every everything. It&#039;s freakin&#039; fantastic.

				A quick and simple soup<br /><br />1-14 1/2 oz. can of stewed or diced tomatoes(juice included)<br />1-15 1/2 oz. can of red kidney or cannellini beans,drained and rinsed well<br />1/2 of an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce<br />3 cups of water<br />1 cup of frozen mixed vegetables<br />1 cup of uncooked elbow or other small pasta<br />Salt,pepper,and basil to taste<br />Grated cheese(I prefer locatelli) for sprinkling on soup<br /><br />Put tomatoes(if they&#039;re too big,you can cut them smaller),beans,tomato sauce,and water in a 3 quart pot and bring to a boil.Season with salt,pepper,and basil.Lower heat to medium and stir in frozen vegetables.cook about 10 to 15 minutes.Lower to a simmer and stir in pasta.Soup is done when the pasta is done.Top with grated cheese if desired..<br /><br />If you have leftovers,the pasta and beans will most likely soak up the liquid.Add the remaining tomato sauce and enough water to cover.Heat up.<br /><br />

Kettle has now become my favorite potato chip brand after Cape Cods and Ruffles Ridges. The spicy Thai is awesome! If you want an interesting party snack, mix that with dried apple chips, and the sweet, salty, spice thing is mmmmhhmmm. Westerly in Midtown was having a Kettle Chip sale a few weeks ago, with lots of different flavors for sale, and I wimped out and got none.

				If you&#039;re looking for everyday food inspiration, I have a blog that I do just for fun, called &quot;Food Porn&quot;. I started it because I love to take pictures of food (as well as cook and make my food pretty, even if it&#039;s not fancy). For the dishes that I make, I usually post recipes too.<br /><br />http://emilysfoodporn.blogspot.com/ (http://emilysfoodporn.blogspot.com/)<br /><br />(hopefully the link will come through, even though it has the word &quot;porn&quot; in it) :)<br />

I went off the recipe from here: http://www.thaitable.com/Thai/recipes/Ginger_and_Chicken_Stir_Fry.htm<br />Except instead of wood ear mushrooms I used sliced shiitake mushrooms, and I also had a bag of frozen &quot;thai stir fry&quot; vegetables from Whole Foods that I threw in when I added the mushrooms.

				My husband had requested meatloaf and instead of going out and buying stuff for my mother&#039;s rather complicated (but yummy) meatloaf, I searched for something simpler to make the most of what I had in my kitchen. I found this basic easy meatloaf recipe that was credited to Katie Lee Joel and made it tonight.....<br /><br />And it actually was very very good!!! So I am passing it on to the meateaters out there. I halved everything and it turned out fine.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;* 1 Tbsp. olive oil<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;* 1/2 medium yellow onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;* 1 garlic clove, minced<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;* 1 medium red pepper, finely diced (about 1 cup)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;* 1 bay leaf<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;* 2 Tbsp. chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;* 2 tsp. chopped fresh thyme<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;* 2 pounds lean ground beef<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;* 2 large eggs, lightly beaten<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;* 3/4 cup dry bread crumbs<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;* 1 cup ketchup<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;* 1 Tbsp. Worcestershire sauce<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;* 2 tsp. kosher salt<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;* 1 tsp. freshly ground black pepper<br /><br />&nbsp;Preheat the oven to 350°. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Spray lightly with oil. Heat the olive oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Sauté the onions, garlic and bay leaf until the onions are tender, about 3 minutes. Add the red pepper and cook until the red pepper is tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in the parsley and thyme and cook for another 2 minutes. Remove pan from the heat and let the onion mixture cool. Discard the bay leaf.<br />In a large bowl, combine the beef, eggs, bread crumbs, 1/2 cup of ketchup, the Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper and the cooled vegetables. Use your hands to mix everything together.<br /><br />Transfer the mixture to the center of the baking sheet and form into a loaf. Coat the meat loaf with the remaining 1/2 cup ketchup.<br /><br />Bake for 1 to 1 1/2 hours (depending on the shape of your loaf), until the meat loaf is firm. Let set for about 5 minutes before slicing.<br /><br /><br />I served it to my hubby with string beans and a baked tater. &nbsp;:mrgreen:

				Tuscan menu for mom and family tonight.<br /><br />Pork roast<br />with 2 day marinade of the following paste: rosemary, garlic, lemon zest, olive oil and salt. Roasted with potatoes and onions, 4hrs at 250f. Pull pork from oven when it hits 160f. Leave in veggies to finish at 400 for 15 minutes.&nbsp; Pour 1/2 cup olive oil and juice 1 lemon over the meat as it rests.&nbsp; Slice and put over veggies.<br /><br />Tuscan white beans with Swiss chard.&nbsp; <br />Simmer 1 bag dry beans for 1.5hrs with 4 cloves garlic, 2 bay leaves and 1/4cup olive oil. Beans should be just soft.<br />Boil chard in salted water till softened, drain. In pan saute lots of garlic with olive oil. Add chard to saute then add in beans with 1 cup bean water or more. Stir and simmer with 1 branch fresh rosemary and some salt.<br />Added bonus: Render some pork belly fat or proscuitti fat before adding in garlic. This will give a more authentic richer flavor.&nbsp; <br /><br />Apple and fennel salad<br />Thin slice 2 apples and 2 fennel bulbs. Toss with olive oil, red vinegar, salt, touch of fig jam (or similar sweet), black pepper. Toss together and let sit. Onto platter with crumbled baked and dried proscuitto (or pancetta).

				Yesterday, did some shopping @ Trader Joe&#039;s in Merrick. Cooked up their soy chorizo last night, added it to my usual pasta primavera w/TJ&#039;s linguini noodles. <br /><br />The noodles were a little on the dry (healthy) side, but otherwise the carnivorous BF was rather pleased with the results. Next time I&#039;ll butter the noodles. The chori-soy comes out crumbly, like ground meat- not sliceable like a real sausage. I&#039;ll save the remaining &quot;soysage&quot; for the vegetarian chili.

				We caught some blackfish (http://www.yankee3.com/Fish/blackfish.html) over the weekend.&nbsp; It&#039;s a traditional chowder fish, but we didn&#039;t have enough for it to be the only main ingredient.&nbsp; So we bought half a dozen large sea scallops (bay scallops would be excellent but they&#039;re more expensive) and a few chowder clams to bulk it up.<br /><br />I used Jasper White&#039;s fish chowder recipe (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/New-England-Fish-Chowder-105200) as a starting point, and came up with:<br /><br />4 slices bacon, diced<br />2 T unsalted butter<br />1 leek, cleaned and slivered<br />1 medium onion, chopped<br />2 bay leaves<br />1 1/4 tsp Old Bay seasoning<br />salt/pepper<br />1 quart chicken broth (or good fish stock)<br />3 smallish red potatoes, cut into small dice (~ 1 cm cubes)<br />3 chowder clams, rough chopped, with their liquid<br />2 fillets blackfish, cut into ~ 1&quot; chunks<br />6 sea scallops, quartered<br />1 1/2 - 1 3/4 cups half and half<br /><br />I browned the diced bacon and removed the pieces, leaving the rendered fat in the pan.&nbsp; Added butter, leeks, onion, bay leaves, and seasoning.&nbsp; Lowered the heat to medium-low and cooked until onions were soft and translucent but not browned, 5-10 minutes.&nbsp; Added chicken broth, clam liquor and potato cubes, raised heat, and cooked until potatoes were soft, about 10 minutes.&nbsp; Lowered heat to low.&nbsp; Added the clam pieces, simmered for 3-4 minutes, and added fish and scallop pieces.&nbsp; Simmered for 5 minutes, turned heat off and let sit for 10 minutes, covered.&nbsp; Added half and half and adjusted seasoning (it took a surprising amount of salt for my taste, but I&#039;m a salt fiend).&nbsp; <br /><br />All of the seafood was *just* cooked - the fish was tender and plump, just barely flaking in big chunks, and the scallops were just past translucent.&nbsp; The proper chowder flavour was there, but it&#039;s not a strong-flavoured recipe.&nbsp; It was more subtle than I expected, but it was still very satisfying.&nbsp; Heavy cream would definitely add richness, but it&#039;s not necessary.<br /><br />This works best with fresh fish.&nbsp; One of the fillets we used was frozen from a fishing trip a couple of weeks ago, and the texture difference was obvious.&nbsp; The pieces that were frozen were much drier and flakier, although they didn&#039;t taste more done.

				Any seafood chowder is good chowder in my book! Lanseaux you said the taste was more subtle than expected- what would you do to ramp up the flavor? Add more clams?

				I&#039;m not sure - it may just be that I&#039;m more accustomed to clam chowder rather than fish or seafood chowder.&nbsp; But more clams might help, as might using a good fish stock or additional clam juice, as opposed to chicken stock (which I used because it&#039;s what I had and I was being lazy).&nbsp; The three chowder clams provided a surprising amount of liquor, so a few more would help in that regard, too.<br /><br />But it&#039;s still delicious - and I&#039;m looking forward to having it for dinner tonight, too.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)

				Astorians,<br />&nbsp; With a hint of snow in the air yesterday, I made a roast pork stew with root vegetables.<br />&nbsp; Basically, I took what was left of last week&#039;s callas (pork shoulder)--little more than a little meat and the marrow bones and threw it into a pot of boiling water.<br />&nbsp; I added several diced cloves of garlic (to taste), a couple of onions--coarsely sliced, a couple of thinly sliced carrots, a parsnip--cut into cubes, a diced stalk of celery, a turnip--cut into cubes, and diced curly (Italian?) parsley.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; As this simmered away, I added six Thai bird peppers--cut into tiny pieces--for heat (I am a dyed in the wool aji fanatic), a bit of crushed red pepper, &quot;Italian Seasoning&quot; from the &quot;spice rack&quot;, and salt and fresh-ground black pepper (to taste).<br />&nbsp; Finally, I added several &quot;handfuls&quot; of dried pearl barley to absorb the liquid and turn a soup into a stew.<br />&nbsp; The result of this experiment was delicious!&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; Isn&#039;t cooking fun? :lol:<br /><br />-=: Astoristani :=-

				trying to decide between tomato soup and black bean soup. <br /><br />tomato soup- saute two minced cloves of garlic in olive oil until golden.<br />Add 1 28 oz can chopped tomatoes and simmer 20-30 minutes. Add 1 tbsp choped fresh rosemary or perhaps dried basil and oregano. I&#039;m still playing around with the seasoning.<br />Add 1 15 oz can drained and rinsed garbanzo beans and cook for about 5 minutes more to warm the beans. <br />Puree in a blender or with a hand blender. <br />Salt and pepper to taste. Serve with crusty bread.<br />oh, and top with parmesan cheese.<br />very yummy. (good with grilled cheese- I think I did pesto and mozzarella last time.)<br />**ah, and you should really try this as well. Add a small spoonful of fresh pesto to each bowl. Delicious!<br /><br />I think I&#039;m leaning towards the black bean soup since I haven&#039;t had it in awhile. <br />recipe to follow when I find it...

In small bowl, stir remaining ingredients until crumbly. Sprinkle over apples. Microwave uncovered on high 7 to 10 minutes, until apples are tender. Serve warm with a scoop of vanilla or cinnamon ice cream! Fresh, sweetened whipped cream will also do!<br /><br />YUMMY! Tomorrow I will just have to reheat and eat!

				Anybody have a pressure cooker and use it a lot? We just got one. So far I&#039;ve used it twice. Once to pressure-steam some beets for pickles, which worked well. And once to make BBQ brisket (last night). The brisket almost worked, but it seemed there wasn&#039;t enough liquid in the pot, and the sauce got a little too carmelized. The meat was great, though! Definitely going to try it again! Suggestions? Recipes? Tips?

				French onion soup stuffing:<br />-I love hearty dishes and wanted the great taste of this soup but with more in it to make it a side dish.<br /><br />6 lg onions sliced thin<br />2 tbs butter plus more for dish<br />1 tbs sugar<br />2 qts liquid (1qt chix stock and 1 1qt water. Or all chix stock)<br />1/2 cup cheap brandy or similar<br />Peasant bread (crusty with hearty interior) cut into inch cubes. enough to fill standard casserole pan.<br />Gruyere or swiss, sliced. Enough to cover top of casserole with at least 1 layer. More if you like.<br />Salt and pepper to taste.<br /><br />In heavy bottom pan on high heat melt 2 tbs butter then add onions, stir in sugar and some salt.&nbsp; <br />Keep stirring onions over high heat till some water releases. Lower heat to medium high and occasionally stir onions. <br />You are looking to wilt down and then lightly caramelize the onions.&nbsp; This will take 20 minutes plus. Do not let them burn.&nbsp; <br />When light browned and softened turn up the heat and add brandy. Stir up and cook till dry.<br />Add 2qts liquid, bring to boil, stir up and lower to simmer. Cover and simmer 30 - 60 minutes or until it smells great.<br />Adjust for seasonings.<br /><br />Butter the casserole dish. Push in cubes and mound them like an apple pie. <br />Ladle over soup to fill, put lid on to squish down cubes of bread. Let sit 5 minutes to soak in. <br />Repeat process with soup till bread is soaked but not broken down.<br />Bake in 350F oven uncovered for 30 minutes. This step will puff up the bread and make it light and fluffy.<br />Bake in oven till cheese gets bubbly and browned on edges.<br /><br />This is a great, cheap and filling side dish. I served it with breaded chicken breast topped with butter tomato sauce.

				I made two things today that turned out well. Particularly good was a carrot soup using leftover chickpea broth. If you cook your own chickpeas (I used a pressure cooker and the recipe from Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone), you can strain and freeze the broth for soups later. I made a simple carrot soup with that broth, onion, celery, parsley, a bit of rice, and just a bit of cumin and cayenne and it turned out great. Looking forward to leftovers tomorrow! I also made a swiss chard frittata with provolone, parmesan, and toasted bread crumbs, which was good too.<br />

It&#039;s Mexican-ish and my fallback for dinner when I don&#039;t have much time.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />2 tbsp olive oil<br />1 pound ground beef<br />salt and pepper to taste<br />1 can diced tomatoes (I like the garlic and onion one) - I don&#039;t drain it.<br />1 can Campbell&#039;s condensed tomato soup<br />1/2 cup salsa<br />6 soft tortillas, cut into 1-inch pieces<br />I&#039;ll also throw in mushrooms or spinach for some extra veggies.<br />1/2 cup (or more, if desired) shredded cheese (I use the Kraft Mexican shredded cheese pack)<br /><br />1. In a skillet over high heat, heat olive oil and cook the ground beef until not pink. Drain fat and return to stove.<br />2. Stir in extra veggies if you want. Season with salt and pepper.<br />3. Stir in diced tomatoes, tomato soup, salsa and tortilla pieces.<br />4. Bring to a boil, then turn heat down to low and simmer for five minutes.<br />5. Stir in cheese. Serve.<br /><br />Enjoy!

				Yesterday I made us a classic Steak Diane, which is a pan-broiled steak (T-Bone) with a pan sauce of shallots, brandy, and mustard. I always overcook steak, but this time only by a little...! And on the side I sauteed up some chard with red onions and garlic, and topped it with fried chickpeas, minced picked beets, and feta. That was good, particularly with a little of the sweet-and-sour pickling liquid drizzled over the top! Fried chickpeas have a great crunch...<br />

				I just made an early dinner of hamburgers from the grass-fed ground beef I got this month in my CSA share.&nbsp; I sauteed some red onions in olive oil til they were a little caramelized, and then added them to the meat.&nbsp; It added just the right amount of moisture (and some extra flavor), but the burgers were perfectly juicy, but not overly messy.&nbsp; Topped them with thinly sliced red onion, chopped cornichons, and ate it all on a toasted challah bun.&nbsp; Delicious!&nbsp; I&#039;m going to have some leftover rice pudding now.

But before baking them, loosen the skin from the meat, and slip a pat of butter and a little sprig of rosemary (fresh or dried) under the skin. Then salt and pepper over the top and 45 minutes in the oven!<br /><br />PG: My favorite dish with condensed tomato soup is a family hot dog casserole (http://sites.google.com/site/harrissmithrecipes/Home/Entrees/hot-dog-casserole) recipe...

				I was looking for something to do with my quinoa, so I made this recipe from allrecipes.com: http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Quinoa-and-Black-Beans/Detail.aspx<br /><br />&nbsp;INGREDIENTS (Nutrition)<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * 1 teaspoon vegetable oil<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * 1 onion, chopped<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * 3 cloves garlic, peeled and chopped<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * 3/4 cup uncooked quinoa<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * 1 1/2 cups vegetable broth<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * 1 teaspoon ground cumin<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * salt and pepper to taste<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * 1 cup frozen corn kernels<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * 2 (15 ounce) cans black beans, rinsed and drained<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * 1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro<br /><br />DIRECTIONS<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;1. Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the onion and garlic, and saute until lightly browned.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;2. Mix quinoa into the saucepan and cover with vegetable broth. Season with cumin, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper. Bring the mixture to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer 20 minutes,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;3. Stir frozen corn into the saucepan, and continue to simmer about 5 minutes until heated through. Mix in the black beans and cilantro.<br /><br /><strong>**** I made the following amendments to this recipe: sauteed part of a red pepper along with the garlic and onion, added a kaffir lime leaf while the quinoa was simmering, and added some chopped zucchini a couple minutes before putting in the corn. Oh, and I only used 1 can of beans (2 would be a lot of beans!) I also served it with salsa and sour cream. Very tasty. </strong>

				Thanks Christine. I&#039;ll check out the health food store closest to me on 23rd Ave near the station and at Trader Joe&#039;s next time I&#039;m downtown. Gotta put it on my list. If Trader Joe&#039;s has it I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll be cheaper than at the local health food store, but I&#039;ll be sure to buy atleast one bag to help support our local Mom&amp; Pop shops. :wink:<br /><br />Your Quinoa dish looks like a nice alternative to oatmeal in the AM.

				After asking what he&#039;d like for dinner tonight, my fiance requested corned beef.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never made it before, but I think I&#039;ll be able to find a good recipe online for a slow cooker (probably will have to adjust it because I have the smaller 4qt version).&nbsp; Anyway, I was wondering if anyone knew if any of the area stores carries corned beef brisket with spices?&nbsp; I&#039;m wondering if it&#039;s only a seasonal thing.

				Sure, it&#039;s pretty simple.&nbsp; The foundation of this steak recipe comes from the Korean BBQ short rib called &quot;Kalbi.&quot;<br /><br />Skirt or flank steaks work just as well for this recipe if only because they have similar meat texture and marble but without the bone.&nbsp; Please note that I don&#039;t have any set recipes and that everything is done by look, feel, smell, and taste, so the exact measurements could be off.<br /><br />In a large, flat container, add honey (or sugar), light soy sauce (as opposed to dark soy sauce, which is used primarily for stewing in Chinese cuisine, not to be confused with low sodium soy sauce), lots of fresh garlic, and a slight drizzle of sesame oil.&nbsp; The smell should be a pungent sweet, salty, garlicky aroma with an obvious douse of sesame.&nbsp; Variations of this recipe often use fresh squeezed orange juice, zest, green onion, ginger, but all of it is unnecessary since most of these flavors are overwhelmed by the garlic and sesame oil anyway.<br /><br />Take some healthy slabs of steak, remove all silver skin, and place in marinade.&nbsp; Marinate for 30 minutes to an hour, occasionally switching sides to make sure both sides are flavored (no more or else the meat will get too salty from the soy sauce.&nbsp; It also depends on how thick your meat is, it&#039;s up to your discretion).&nbsp; The marinade acts as a flavor enhancer but also brines the meat to ensure tenderness.&nbsp; If the steaks are cold and just coming out of the refrigerator, it&#039;s best to marinate them at room temperature so that the meat can come to room temperature while soaking up the flavors, thereby killing two birds with one stone.&nbsp; It&#039;s not a good idea to cook cold steak at high heat anyway because the center always turns out to be undercooked.<br /><br />Heat a hot skillet as scorching hot as it can get (usually 3~5 minutes on high flame).&nbsp; Open a window because the searing will cause smoke and smell up the place.&nbsp; Remove meat from marinade, pat as dry as possible with paper towel.&nbsp; Place meat on skillet presentation side down (that side will get the best sear).&nbsp; Sear for 3~5 minutes.&nbsp; For the first couple of minutes, place the meat on the pan and don&#039;t touch or check on them.&nbsp; After a couple of minutes, the meat will naturally loosen from the pan, meaning it is well-seared.&nbsp; Check to make sure it&#039;s the color you like (usually a dark dark brown with some bits of black char both from heat on the meat and the caramelization of the sugar in the marinade).&nbsp; Turn meat over and sear other side.&nbsp; Usually a couple of minutes as well.&nbsp; Liquid will juice out of the meat, don&#039;t worry.&nbsp; Just let the meat cook till it forms a nice, dark brown crust.&nbsp; At this point the meat will be a nice medium rare-ish.&nbsp; Prod the meat and feel for texture (soft as a pillow = rare, some firmness = medium rare, hard as a rock = well done).<br /><br />Remove meat from skillet, place foil over and let rest for 5~10 minutes.&nbsp; <br /><br />Remove fat from the pan.&nbsp; Reduce flame to medium/low and place marinade liquid into skillet.&nbsp; There will be a lot of sizzling.&nbsp; Reduce liquid till a thin syrup consistency.&nbsp; Turn off heat.&nbsp; Add unsalted butter to finish.<br /><br />As for okra, it&#039;s even simpler.<br /><br />Wash and cut okra into small, cross-section slices (the smaller you make them the faster it will cook).&nbsp; Julien a healthy amount of fresh ginger.&nbsp; Split green or red chili in half (leave seeds for extra spicy, take out seeds for light spicy).<br /><br />In a pan, add oil, then okra and chilis.&nbsp; Season with salt.&nbsp; When the okra starts to soften, add ginger.&nbsp; If the okra starts eating up all of the oil, add a little bit more oil.&nbsp; If the okra you have is older and less tender, add a splash of water, just enough to have some liquid in the bottom of the pan and let simmer while covered for a couple of minutes.&nbsp; If the okra is nice and tender, you can omit this last step.&nbsp; Serve immediately.

				Yeah, don&#039;t heat nonstick skillets over high heat. The teflon (or whatever) will break down and go into your food. If you manage to burn it, the fumes will kill your pet parrot (if you have one) dead. A cast-iron pan is best for searing meat.

				Also, any kind of stainless steel pan will work as well.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t have to be cast iron.<br /><br />And a tip for cleaning pans used for searing:<br /><br />When the pan is still hot, add room temperature/lukewarm water.&nbsp; It&#039;s very important that you do NOT add cold water or else it could ruin and deform the pan.&nbsp; As the water sizzles, use a spoon to scrape along the bottom of the pan.&nbsp; If you were using wine or vinegar, this process would be considered deglazing.&nbsp; Once you collect all the bits along the bottom into your water concoction, dispose (usually in the sink).&nbsp; Your pan should be pretty darn clean only requiring a little soap and a light scrub.

				The potato-broccoli, cheddar soup sounds great.&nbsp; It definitely sounds like a hearty soup.&nbsp; I suppose if you add bacon bits on top it&#039;d be the perfect baked potato blended and ladled into a bowl =).<br /><br />Your soup reminds me of two soups I love to make.<br /><br />My broccoli soup is a little bit different.<br /><br />Broccoli<br />Chicken stock<br />Lemon<br /><br />I like to blanch broccoli in homemade, strained chicken stock although boxed chicken stock works fine as well.&nbsp; Once slightly tender and bright green, put broccoli into blender along with some of the blanching stock and blend.&nbsp; Add salt and pepper to taste.&nbsp; Pour into pot.&nbsp; If too thick, add more stock to thin out.&nbsp; If you like, add cream or milk to smooth out taste (I prefer no cream).&nbsp; Before serving, squeeze a wedge of lemon to brighten the flavor.&nbsp; If you want to be fancy, drizzle a bit of lemon oil (made from warming canola and lemon zest over low heat in a pan).<br /><br />The other soup I&#039;m reminded of is my kabocha pumpkin soup.&nbsp; This is actually a joint recipe by my wife and me.&nbsp; This soup definitely impresses guests because of its rich color and unique taste.&nbsp; It looks and tastes like the &quot;exotic&quot; version of butternut squash soup.<br /><br />Onion<br />Dashi Powder (Japanese kelp and fish based flavoring)<br />Kabocha (Japanese/Asian) pumpkin<br />Garlic (1 or 2 cloves max)<br /><br />After prepping the pumpkin by removing the skin and cutting into large chunks, saute onion with olive oil in a pot.&nbsp; When onions are tender, add pumpkin.&nbsp; Sautee for a minute or two with garlic.&nbsp; Add water to cover pumpkin, add a healthy amount of dashi to taste.&nbsp; After cooking till pumpkin is fork tender (an hour), blend.&nbsp; If you want to be fancy, serve with toasted pumpkin seeds on top and a drizzle of truffle oil or dollop of creme fraiche.<br /><br />Also, Harlan, how did you make Pho stock?&nbsp; Everytime I&#039;ve attempted it using fresh, natural ingredients, it never turns out exactly like the soup in restaurants.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried quite a few times and have even asked my Vietnamese friends to share their recipes.&nbsp; My friend&#039;s mom has even given me a homemade spice packet for Pho before, and it still wasn&#039;t quite right.&nbsp; This leads me to the conclusion that Pho soup at restaurants must use MSG or some sort of pre-made, processed bullion.&nbsp; When I&#039;ve used these bullion cubes, the taste is usually pretty spot on.&nbsp; That being said, I try hard not to use MSG when cooking, so I&#039;m definitely looking for a natural alternative.

				Yeah, I try to eat vegetarian as much as possible, but even I thought about how good some crispy bits o&#039;bacon would&#039;ve tasted with the soup!<br /><br />The pumpkin soup sounds wonderful. I&#039;m not familiar with the Asian spices, though.<br /><br />As for MSG, I think it&#039;s reputation is similar to HFCS: Not exactly dangerous in moderation, unless you&#039;re allergic or otherwise highly-sensitive.

				Gotta resurrect this thread, since I nailed dinner tonight. (For a change... I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve been fully happy with dinner since the last time I posted on this thread!) I wanted to use up stuff in the house without shopping, so I thawed some pork loin, used up some sprouting potatoes (CSA), made a dent on a container of sun-dried tomatoes (Rosario&#039;s) and finished off half a bunch of mustard greens.<br /><br />Pork loin, salt and peppered, seared on a cast-iron pan in a bit of oil, then roasted at 400 until 140 degrees, then sliced. Served over sliced onions that were cooked very slowly in butter and chopped sun-dried tomatoes until soft and golden.<br /><br />Potatoes were coarsely chopped, then boiled. Served with a mustard green sauce. Sauce was made by boiling the greens (not the stems) for 10 minutes, then removing the greens. 1 cup of boiling liquid was seasoned with salt and a bit of sugar, then reduced to 1/4 c and put in a blender. Cooked the greens some more in plenty of butter, until very soft, then threw that into the blender too. Pureed, seasoned with salt, pepper, and white wine vinegar. A really brilliant color and flavor.<br /><br />It was good. The sauces were the key. (Inspired by some somewhat similar recipes in Peterson (http://www.amazon.com/Sauces-Classical-Contemporary-Sauce-Making/dp/0471292753)...)<br /><br />

				I actually make Rachael Ray&#039;s (sigh) ancho chicken tortilla soup, which came out really good.&nbsp; I dislike her so much, but some of her recipes are decent.<br /><br />I *think* the Associated on B&#039;way/21st has sour oranges in the produce section along with the other Latin produce (like yuca and chayote).&nbsp; The sour orange/lime soup sounds pretty good so I may have to try that if this cold keeps up!

				I got a pretty good recipe for vegetable tian out of a French cookbook. Basically you saute in olive oil some sliced onion, eggplant, red pepper, and garlic (to your preference - this time I made it there&#039;s way too much onion and eggplant for me) until the eggplant is golden, then pour it all into a shallow baking dish. <br /><br />On top of that, put down thin slices of raw zucchini and plum tomatoes in alternating rows until the whole thing is covered. Sprinkle salt, pepper, rosemary, and thyme to taste. Bake at 375 for 25 minutes. Then, sprinkle on 3 TBSP of bread crumbs and some parmesan cheese (I used feta this last time and it worked well). Drizzle olive oil over the top. Bake for about 10 more minutes or until sufficiently browned. Then you eat it with rice or pasta. <br /><br />Aside from all the chopping, it&#039;s pretty easy, cheap, tasty, and healthy. It can probably be cooked at a higher temperature. I think I&#039;ll try that next time.

				Rachel Ray.......uhh......yeah......haha, j/k.<br /><br />Give credit where credit&#039;s due, I guess.&nbsp; I never watch her: 1) her cooking/food doesn&#039;t appeal to me, 2) I can&#039;t understand a word she&#039;s saying with that raspy voice.<br /><br />But I&#039;m sure the soup is good.<br /><br />By the way, I have been planning on making the sour orange tortilla soup for some time.&nbsp; I have a chicken breast to shred saved up for it and I&#039;ll be making stock pretty soon anyway.&nbsp; So as soon as I get some sour oranges, I&#039;ll let you know how it turns out.<br /><br />As for the vegetable tian, it sounds kind of like a ratatouille or a caponata of sorts.&nbsp; It does sound good.&nbsp; I&#039;d imagine any sharp, salty cheese and/or oozy melted cheese (or both) would go well with it.&nbsp; Me thinks parmesan, pecorino, feta, or even cotija would be a nice contrast.&nbsp; Heck, dollops of ricota or macarpone sound good as well.<br /><br />I love this kind of dish.&nbsp; It&#039;s so wholly satisfying even without meat.<br /><br />Oh, I&#039;d like to make one correction to an earlier post - I meant yuzu, not yuzo.&nbsp; When I re-read it, I kept thinking to myself <em>something looks off, but I&#039;m not sure what it is...</em>.&nbsp; Anyway, not that it matters...

				Oh, an important part I left out that will be useful knowledge for anyone who hasn&#039;t cooked with eggplant: salt the slices ahead of time and let them sit in a colander for a half hour. Then rinse them off. This draws out some of the bitter juices.

				Astorians,<br />&nbsp; It&#039;s been a long time since I&#039;ve posted here but I thought that I&#039;d give this thread a bump and try to revive it.<br />So, what are you making for dinner tonight? <br />&nbsp; A few weeks ago I spent, as the Manitobans say, a fair bit (actually a large bit) of time down on Mott and Mullberry Street in Chinatown taking in the sights and tastes along Grand Avenue, and the environs north or Canal Street.&nbsp; Alligator hooves in a food court/market between Mott and Mulberry, Beef Pen**s available by the pound on Elizabeth Street, and indescribable seafood on every corner, G-d, don&#039;t you love NYC?<br />&nbsp; Anyway, I took home an amazing Chinese soup from a stall that I don&#039;t remember how to find again and this is my version of an amazing mushroom soup.<br />&nbsp; While I have been trying to recreate it, I&#039;ve added my own touches.&nbsp; For most Astorians, this soup might be cost-prohibitive, since they do not have the ingredients in their pantry.<br />&nbsp; None the less enjoy<br /><br />Mott Street Chinese Mushroom Soup<br /><br />Ingredients (in proportion)<br />5 dried Shiitake Mushrooms (buy the more expensive variety they have more flavor)<br />5 cups Water<br />1 bunch green onions (finely minced)<br />2 cloves of garlic (finely minced)<br />1 bouillon cube (I use Bao Long Vi Bo Kho cubes from Viet Nam)<br />1 tsp black pepper<br />1 tsp sea (or kosher) salt<br />1 Tbsp Soy Sauce<br />1 Tbsp Sesame Oil (I prefer Sesame Chile Oil)<br />2 Tbsp Black Bean/Garlic Sauce<br />1 Tbsp of coarse ground Chile Powder (I use either Korean of Vietnamese--piment miett or Korean--Gochutgaru)<br />20 Raw peanuts (goober peas), shelled no need to discard the husks<br />2 oz Tofu of choice (I tend to use flavored pressed tofu such as su ji or spiced pressed tofu with soy sauce, but any tofu will be a welcome addition) cubed into small pieces<br />2 Handfulls of Bean Sprouts<br />1 handfull of Bamboo shoots, sliced into short threads <br /><br />Directions<br />(add water as needed to maintain a soup)<br /><br />1. Add green onions, garlic, black pepper, and salt to 5 cups water. Bring to a partial boil. Allow to cool to the <br /><br />temperature of warm tap water<br /><br />2. Add 5 Shiitake Mushroom to warm water and allow to soak for 30 minutes (or until rehydrated) to create a basic broth<br /><br />3. Remove Mushrooms, stem as needed, and return to basic broth<br /><br />4. Add Soy Sauce, Sesame Oil, Chile Powder, Black Bean Sauce, and peanuts to broth and simmer for 30 minutes<br /><br />5. Add Tofu to the broth, continue simmerring<br /><br />6. Add Bean Sprouts and bamboo shoots, continue simmering until the peanuts have the texture of a frozen pea.<br />

				Cypriot Sour Trahanas Soup<br /><br />Bought a package of sour trahanas from Mediterranean Foods out of pure curiosity &amp; did some experimenting - good results if you like a tangy, yogurt-like sour-ish flavor to a very hearty soup.&nbsp; <br /><br />Dump bag of trahanas into bowl &amp; covered with tap water &amp; set aside.&nbsp; In large stock pot, boil a dozen chicken legs in salted water with shallots, celery &amp; carrots for about 1 1/2 hours until broth is rich &amp; meat was falling off the bones (skim as needed).&nbsp; Remove chix legs from stock and add in trahanas (which by now should have absorbed water &amp; become like an oatmeal consistency).&nbsp; Stir to combine &amp; heat on low stirring often to prevent sticking to bottom of pot.&nbsp; Shred meat &amp; add back into soup.&nbsp; Add salt/pepper to taste &amp; ladle into bowls.&nbsp; I like to top the bowl with a small pat of butter &amp; sprinkle with dried mint - really wakes up the flavor.&nbsp; <br /><br />My guess is this will be even better tomorrow!

				I am currently making kotopoulo kokkinisto. I&#039;ve never had it before, but I came across the dish while looking for an easy way to use up some red wine that I have opened. I was pretty excited that all I had to buy to make it was chicken and an onion.

				I run several meet up groups and we hold our meetings at Bella Napoli on Madison in Midtown--an excellent and relatively cheap Italian Restaurant that serves up great Italian fare at a very low price.&nbsp; <br />I&#039;m a huge fan of their Straiatella alla Romana soup and thought that I would try to recreate on the cheap (it&#039;s the economy you know...) this evening with a little help from the W3.&nbsp; <br />I can&#039;t wait for lunch tomorrow, because I think that I nailed it.<br /><br />So, Here goes:<br /><br /><strong>Stratiatella Soup for one or two:</strong><br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Ingredients</span><br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>2 cups chicken broth (you can also use 2 cups of water and a Maggi bouillon cube)</li><li>Half a box of frozen <strong>chopped</strong> spinach</li><li>1 egg--<strong><em>preferably not laid in an Astoria apartment</em></strong></li><li>A few generous pinches of grated peccorino romano cheese (I substituted Asagio)</li></ul><span class="bbc_u">Spices</span><br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>A couple of pinches of custom Italian seasoning blend (basil, thyme, oregano, marjoram, parsley)</li><li>A shake of of garlic powder</li><li>A bit of crushed dried red pepper to taste</li><li>Salt and Black Pepper to taste</li></ul><span class="bbc_u">Method</span><br /><br />In a sauce pan:<br /><ul class="bbc_list" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li>Raise the chicken stock and spices to rapid boil</li><li>Reduce heat to a medium boil and add the chopped frozen spinach</li><li>Once the Spinach is thawed out and cooked reduce the heat to a medium simmer</li><li>Add a cracked egg and stir vigorously to create boiled egg threads in the broth</li><li>Add the cheese and thicken the broth </li><li>Serve or reserve</li></ul><span class="bbc_u">Time to prepare:</span><br />About 10 minutes<br /><br />Enjoy Manhattan Restaurants on the cheap!<br /><br />-=+Astorian+i=-<br /><br />
