				I know I&#39;m a newbie, so let me know if this post is in the wrong place. But browsing around, I&#39;ve seen a lot of wistful talking about &quot;wouldn&#39;t it be great if Astoria had a real bookstore&quot; and &quot;could we set up a book-swap&quot; and &quot;is anyone interested in a book club&quot;. <br /><br />Now, I think these are all great ideas. If I were really brave (or really rich), I&#39;d give up my job with health benefits and open up a little used bookstore and be really happy. Or I could start a petition to get Barnes &amp; Ignoble to bring the chain to Astoria. (After all, we have 3 Starbuxom here now, and they are thriving...)<br /><br />I visited a great place in Baltimore called &quot;The Book Thing&quot;. It&#39;s like a book-swap. It gives away thousands of books every weekend, operating out of a basement. It survives on donations and grants. See http://www.bookthing.org (http://www.bookthing.org).<br /><br />Brother, can you spare a basement?<br /><br />Of course, if there were an existing location (Freeze Peach, anyone?) with space or interests in expanding, that would be ideal, but somehow I doubt this is feasible.

				Maybe someone could host a bookswapping party, invite everybody out to a handy location, and have everyone bring a book or two to trade. I did it for my bday and it was a lot of fun. If enough people are interested, it could become a monthly community event.<br /><br />

				I have a hard time parting with most of my books, but I do keep a special pile that usually ends up getting donated to thrift shops... I&#39;d love to be able to swap them with fellow bibliophiles instead!&nbsp; :-D<br /><br />A weekend or weekday evening will be best for me. Next Thursday evening would be fine. <br /><br />Locations: <br />I suggested Freeze Peach -- comfortable and friendly -- but I don&#39;t know if they&#39;d be available to host.

				I personally love the suggestions of Cafe Bar/Cup/Sunswick... mostly because it means no trekking out to Ditmars!&nbsp; (Sorry, Ditmars neighbors.)&nbsp; Any one of those would be good for me, and I&#39;m good with Thursday night.<br /><br />If we&#39;re getting the books back after the swap I can probably swap out something a little better... but I do have a few I could trade otherwise...

				So you guys have to tell me what you like to read - I won&#39;t bring War and Peace if no one is into Russians :)<br /><br />I like just about everything. I&#39;m always willing to try new sci-fi and fantasy writers.<br />I like trashy romance novels, classics, mysteries. Not too big on spy lit, chic lit, or horror. Nonfiction favorites include psychology and religion.<br /><br />Some of my favorites include Angela Carter, who writes sort of fairy stories only with very dark and psychologically intelligent underpinnings, Terry Pratchett, who is satirically brilliant, and Sparkle Hayter, who writes funny mysteries centering around Robin Hudson, minion of a tv news station. <br />

				The way I explain &quot;South Midtown Astoria&quot; to other Astorians is that there&#39;s less &quot;stuff&quot;, but the stuff we do have is all pretty consistently good (as opposed to the commercial strips on Broadway or 30th Ave that are certainly busier, but I think they tend to vary in quality... YMMV.)&nbsp; <br /><br />Beyond Cup, Sunswick, Cafe Bar, Pizzeria Uno&#39;s, S&#39;Agapo, and Locale (and I haven&#39;t tried the latter two), we don&#39;t really have too many other restaurants.&nbsp; But I&#39;m a big fan of the menus and environment at Cup and Cafe Bar, and the beer selection at Sunswick.&nbsp; We also have the Starbucks, the Museum of the Moving Image, and I hear Little Bistro is good, though I haven&#39;t been there myself.<br /><br />Back to books... I read just about any genre, I&#39;m kind of predisposed to strong character writing and strong storytelling.&nbsp; I do have a love of fantasy/sci fi too, but it has to be done well.&nbsp; There&#39;s plenty of sci fi that I would chuck out the window.&nbsp; I think it comes from taking writing classes in a southern university fiction department!&nbsp; Although my teachers there hated sci fi/fantasy... <br /><br />I devoured all of Diana Gabaldon a few years ago, I need to sit down and reread all of her stuff so I can check her newest out of the library, but it&#39;s so daunting.&nbsp; Those novels are huge!&nbsp; Also Orson Scott Card (going many many years back), J. K. Rowling (a given?), E. L. Doctorow (love some of his stuff, can leave some of his stuff), and lately I&#39;ve been indulging and reliving some older childhood favorites like Susan Cooper, S. E. Hinton and Zilpha Keatley Snyder.&nbsp; <br /><br />Phew!

				One of the best books I have ever read was The Jungle by Upton Sinclair.&nbsp; It really makes you think about the foods we eat.&nbsp; It also gives a good insight as to how our country use to be.&nbsp; Many people would say that the book isn&#39;t true and that the stuff talked about never really happened but it did bring about changes in the food industry so it really makes you think.<br /><br />

				I&#39;m really glad that so many people are interested in a bookswap. Although I don&#39;t know a lot of the places that were suggested, let me try to sum up the requirements. <br /><br />We need to meet someplace that can handle:<br /><br />-a largish group of people (Starbuxom are too crowded) <br />-a block of 1-2 hours (most cafés/restaurants don&#39;t like a group to monopolize a table over such a long period)<br />-moving around to exchange books (tables in cafés/restaurants are usually too tightly packed for free movement)<br />-talking (most bars I know are too loud) <br />-reading or at least skimming (<em>all</em> bars I know are too dark)<br />-near to public transportation preferred<br /><br />...Which is why I suggested Freeze Peach... if they&#39;re busy this Thursday evening (has this been confirmed?) maybe we could do a weekend afternoon/evening instead. Let me know if the other locations are vastly different from the bars/cafés/restaurants of my experience, and we&#39;ll go from there.

				Freeze Peach is a fantastic venue, but it is indeed booked for this Thursday (per calendar).<br /><br />Cafe bar would be fine for a group of this size in terms of space, sound, lighting, etc. Since we&#39;ve already settled on Thursday, why don&#39;t we just go to Cafe Bar this time. I know that a lot of us have tight schedules, and I personally find it stressful to change something this close to time - and I know I&#39;m not nearly as busy as some of the other folks signed up for this! :)<br /><br />I see this as something that we will probably want to do on a monthly basis (to return old books and bring fresh books) so maybe at this meeting we can talk about a day of the week that meshes better with the FP schedule, and I can clear it with That Dude.

				Instructions for a book swap:<br /><br />1. Bring books that either you want to give away or really want to share. You can request that a book be returned, but it&#39;s best not to swap the signed first edition of &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; which is a family heirloom. If you can&#39;t replace it, or buying a new one would be a hardship, better not swap it. OTOH, if you want to share a great book and want to get it back, exchange phone numbers and email addresses with the swappee and make sure they know you want it back. Mark it clearly with your name and contact info. <br /><br />My personal preference is to bring books prepared to release them into the great unknown and request only that the swappee enjoy them and pass them along when finished. However, sometimes there&#39;s a book so great you just have to share it and so great you just don&#39;t want to give it up forever. That&#39;s understandable :)<br /><br />2. Bring 2 or 3 books (or more, if you want). <br /><br />3. Unwanted books can be donated to Seaburn books. (if no one takes them and the owner doesn&#39;t want to take them home again).<br /><br />That&#39;s all I can think of. I think there will just be a few of us, so this can be relaxed and informal.

				I hope this posts in the proper place...<br /><br />I&#39;m a newbie here as well, I passed by the Freeze Peach lastnight for the first time and felt like I stumbled across a place with a similar feel to something I also would like to have on my own someday. Just as one of you mentioned--I too would drop my well paying, health insurance providing job to open up a cafe&#39; conataining books, good company that can be peacefull, thoughtful and social---wrap it up with good books and discussion, writing perhaps etc etc----a warm/homey feel....<br />anyway, on the book thing--I also would be interested in book swapping/discussion/writing groups/etc...as I love to read write and talk with those who enjoy the same. If anything, suggestions on where I could meet up with any of you that collaborate for things of this nature---please advise&nbsp; :-D<br />thank you kindly<br />

				I am stuck at work&nbsp; :-( and cannot make it to the book swap. But I did post a list of my free books back in May. Only one person claimed two of my books and I haven&#39;t given away the rest yet. Here was my posting:<br /><br />http://astorians.com/index.php?topic=2163.msg14452#msg14452<br /><br />Send me a message if you are interested in any. I will try to arrange a drop off/pick up if you are interested.

				I thought the folks on this thread might find this link interesting: www.librarything.com<br /><br />LibraryThing is basically a site where people post catalogues of the books they own. You can review your books and look at other users&#39; catalogues for similar interests. Be forewarned: This site is oddly addictive.<br /><br />If you care, my catalogue (which is still a work in progress) is filed under username Orange44.

				Meeting notes and plans:<br />The bookswap of last Thursday was a lot of fun. We ate, drank, shared books, and talked about british comedy. We decided that we&#39;d like to meet again on a monthly basis, and that if possible we&#39;d like to meet at freeze peach, perhaps on Sunday afternoons, hopefully at the end of July. <br /><br />I contacted meesh of fp and he is cool with us meeting there on Sundays around 2.00ish. So our next meeting will be July 30 at 2.00. <br /><br />Our agreement with FP is to take out all the books we bring in. Also, to take any brawls over which translation of &quot;Remembrance of Things Past&quot; is the best outside.<br /><br />Are we cool with calling ourselves the Book Swap? Does anyone have any brilliant funky name ideas? Speak now or you know the rest.

				<em>from today&#39;s Writer&#39;s Almanac:</em><br /><br />It was on this day in 1954 that the first part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy was published—The Fellowship of the Ring. Seventeen years had passed since the publication of The Hobbit (1937), to which The Fellowship of the Ring was a sequel. The Hobbit had gotten a great review in The Times Literary Supplement, and it went on to become a best-seller. So J.R.R. Tolkien (books by this author) began working on a sequel, about the nephew of the hobbit Bilbo, the nephew being named Frodo. He decided that the story would center on the magical ring, which hadn&#39;t been an important part of The Hobbit.<br /><br />Tolkien spent the next seventeen years working on The Lord of the Rings. He was well into his first draft by the time World War II broke out in 1939. The book became more complicated as Tolkien went along, and it was taking much longer to finish than he had planned. He went through long stretches where he didn&#39;t write anything and considered giving the project up altogether. He wanted to make sure all of the details about the geography, language, and mythology of Middle Earth were consistent. He made elaborate charts to keep track of the events of his story, showing dates, days of the week, the direction of the wind, and the phases of the moon.<br /><br />Finally, in the fall of 1949, Tolkien finished writing The Lord of the Rings. He typed the final copy out himself, sitting on a bed in his attic, balancing the typewriter on his lap, and tapping it out with two fingers.<br /><br />The Lord of the Rings turned out to be more than half a million words long. Tolkien wanted to publish it in one volume, his publisher wanted to divide it into three volumes and so the first volume, The Fellowship of the Ring, came out on this day in 1954.<br /><br />Only about three and a half thousand copies were printed, but it turned out to be incredibly popular, and it went through a second printing in just six weeks.<br />

				That&#39;s what I suspected, Rachel!&nbsp; :-)<br />Did you hear that joke about the flooding that destroyed the Bush Presidential Library?&nbsp; Both coloring books were ruined and he hadn&#39;t finished coloring either of them.

				We&#39;ve been cordially asked by FP to make sure that we do take all books that come in with us, out with us.<br /><br />I wonder if anyone would be willing to hang around until the very end and just make double-sure that no straggler tomes are left behind? It can be someone different every time, maybe. Or maybe the last person to leave can take a quick look-round. This is the only thing they have asked of us and I&#39;d like to show our gratitude for their hospitality by leaving things as we found them.

				The New Orleans Public Library is asking for any and all hardcover and paperback books in an effort to restock the shelves after Katrina. The library staff will assess which titles will be designated for its collections. The rest will be distributed to destitute families or sold for library fundraising.<br />Please send all book donations to:<br /><br />Rica A. Trigs, Public Relations<br />New Orleans Public Library<br />219 Loyola Avenue<br />New Orleans, LA 70112<br /><br />If you tell the post office that they are for the library in New Orleans, they will give you the library rate, which is slightly less than the book rate

				I&#39;m glad you caught that, erpo. I think it&#39;s funny that people were donating Russian grammar books. It sounds like they were just trying to use the charity as a dumping ground ... that&#39;s not very charitable!!<br /><br />I wonder, though, if we could incorporate donations to one of the worthy/suitable efforts listed on the ALA page into our bookswaps? I mean, we could go ahead and share books with each other and also set aside a few to be mailed off. <br /><br />Of course, someone would probably have to do a bit of legwork - contacting the orgs, finding out what they want, etc. I&#39;d be willing to help out with that, is anyone else interested? We all love reading and the pursuit and of knowledge, why not share that with people who don&#39;t have the deliciously obscene glut of books that we enjoy?<br /><br />Please - everyone let me know what you think - is this something that we can incorporate into our bookswaps?
