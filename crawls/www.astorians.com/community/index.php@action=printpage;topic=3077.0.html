				Greetings,<br /><br />We&#39;re proud to announce that a major update to Astorians is in the works! We&#39;re calling this Astorians 3.0. The new look we&#39;ve been working on is now the default theme on Astorians for all users and guests.<br /><br />There&#39;s a few things you should know about Astorians 3.0:<br /><br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li> Astorians 3.0 is now the official theme for Astorians.</li><li> If you prefer the Astorians 2.0 interface (the old one), you are welcome to use it (the same goes for those that use the SMF Default Theme). You are under no obligation to utilize the new features and theme. Just simply select &quot;Astorians 2.0&quot; per the instructions below. You should note however that Astorians 2.0 will no longer be upgraded or supported.</li><li> We&#39;ve also added a couple new categories</li><li> Feedback - We welcome your feedback and impressions.</li></ul><br />INSTRUCTIONS for changing your theme:<br /><br />1. Click on the button on the top of the scren that says &quot;PROFILE&quot;<br />2. On the left menu bar select &quot;Look and Layout Preferences&quot;<br />3. Where it says &quot;Current Theme&quot; select the highlighted text that says &quot;Change&quot;<br />4. You will now see a list of available themes. Select the one you like best.<br /><br />* Special thanks to our very own <strong><em>wasabisam</em></strong> for the great work she&#39;s done making both Astorians 2.0, and the new theme as well *

				Astorians 3.0 is totally the wave of the future. Its like the new Tab energy drink (pink for girls) but not crappy. So nothing like that. But familiar and user-friendly, while still being exciting and new. Honestly, my only gripe is that its a bit slow... but that could be resultant of a variety of factors, including my own mental retardation.<br /><br />Cheers to all you developers behind the scenes!<br />&nbsp;

				Well, the latest seems to be that the ChatBox is indeed using a bit more processor power than I&#39;d like. So I&#39;m going to try and contact the person who made the program to find a solution. I&#39;ll update as soon as I get any more information.

				I really like the chatbox and hope it comes back.&nbsp; It&#39;s an aspect of online boards that seems to be missing...immediate response to a question/thought/hello.&nbsp; Especially with a major goal of this board being to foster community, I think the chat angle is fun.

				Out of curiousity, who&#39;s hosting the server that this site is on, and who&#39;s paying for the space and the bandwidth? SMF is reporting that&#39;s it&#39;s sometimes taking more than 4 seconds to build a &quot;show unread posts since last visit&quot; page for me, a mere 22 database queries. Are we overloading the server? Would donations to the Astorians.com server fund allow an upgrade that would make things go faster? (http://www.radioparadise.com/graphics/smiles/propeller.gif)

				Hi Harlan,<br /><br />Currently the site is funded solely by me and I&#39;m on a shared host. Just this weekend I&#39;ve purchased my own server and will be migrating the site over the next few days. But yes, this server is too overcrowded and isn&#39;t performing well.<br /><br />I&#39;m currently with www.site5.com<br />For a small site they are fine, but you can outgrow their services pretty fast in my opinion. I may add a &quot;donate&quot; button to the site soon. I&#39;d rather not go the advertising route if it&#39;s not necessary (which I don&#39;t think it is at the moment).<br /><br />Site5 is also responsible for the recent server instability. All this has prompted me to start looking for another provider within the last couple weeks.

				Great job with the new layout! &nbsp;I&#39;ve got lots to say on the makin&#39; money topic, &#39;cause I think about this kind of thing lots...<br /><br />1) T-shirts - http://www.spreadshirt.com/ (http://www.spreadshirt.com/) - you submit your design and name your price above what they charge and you get the profit. &nbsp;It&#39;s probably way cheaper to have them made in bulk somewhere, but this is easier.<br /><br />2) When I was a kid I used to rent a button maker and work craft fairs. &nbsp;They were big and clunky, though. &nbsp;I bet you could get better these days. &nbsp;If you rented one for a weekend, you could probably get volunteers to make the buttons no prob.<br /><br />3) Advertising doesn&#39;t have to be annoying pop-ups or google searches. &nbsp;It would take a little work, but you could easily add a guide book or listing of places in Astoria to the site and charge places to be added. &nbsp;Hmmm.... maybe I should do that on my website....<br /><br />4) this isn&#39;t really about you making money, but about me, me, me.... y&#39;all should come to the Magic of Astoria Craft Fair at United Methodist Church<br />30-44 30th Road Corner of Crescent Street on Sept. 4th (that&#39;s Labor Day). &nbsp;my wife and I will have a table there.

				I really appreciate all the input on this.<br /><br />I&#39;m not completely against eventually looking at the option of advertsing for the site, but if we can avoid it I think it would be cool.<br /><br />For now I think I&#39;m just going to add a &quot;donate&quot; button to the site so that anyone who is inclined to support the site can do so. But I&#39;d like to keep it as simple and unobtrusive as possible.<br /><br />We&#39;re not talking about substantial equipment costs to operate the site. It&#39;s somewhere around $600/year. There is a significant time investment for wasabisam and I, but it&#39;s something I enjoy doing (though I&#39;d love to do it for a living, but that&#39;s just a dream). The other mods also really contribute a lot in keeping things organized and I&#39;m really thankful for that.<br /><br />Donate button will appear in the next few days.<br /><br />In other news, we are definitely moving to another server. That should happen in another day or two. The current host I&#39;m with (Site5) keeps disabling the site because we&#39;re using too many server resources. I&#39;m not too happy with their plan at the moment. But I&#39;ve got a brand new server all ready for us that should speed things up a bit. And we&#39;ve got guaranteed memory and CPU priority that will mean that someone can&#39;t just turn the site off when they think we have too many users online. I&#39;ll provide another update right when I migrate the site to the new server because you&#39;ll notice some anomalies while It&#39;s in progress.

A button, like the little beauty on the cork board above, would be perfect. We could spot each other on the train, the supermarket, the avenues, anywhere. They can be worn on a purse handle,&nbsp; a shirt pocket, a jacket lapel, heck, even on a dog leash!<br /><br />Anyone have any ideas for a button? Anyone know anyone who owns one of those Badge-A-Minit machines? We buy the ready-made buttons from them and then resell them here to support merm and his incredible work on behalf of all of us and our enjoyment of this board. Comon, folks, ask around. There are plenty of church groups that have sold bottons in the past. Perhaps they can give us leads. Ask people at street fairs, and flea markets—anywhere you go.

				Just a quick update here. I&#39;ve heard from a couple people that they haven&#39;t been able to access the site sometimes throughout the day, or that the site looks messed up. That should be fixed by tomorrow. The reason that it does this is because in the process of moving the site to a new server the new ip address has to get linked to the domain name. It takes time for the new address to show up in everyone&#39;s internet provider&#39;s servers so that&#39;s why it looks strange sometimes. It usually just takes 1-2 days for all these to disappear. Just an FYI.

				It has got to look as close to the one on the corkboard (page header) so that it is instantly recognizable. The whole idea is to be able to spot &#39;Astorians&#39; on the train, the supermarket, on the avenues . . .<br /><br />And it should also be small enough not to be gauche—like 1 1/4 inches—and easy to wear on anything; purse strap, shirt pocket, jacket lapel, dangling from the rear-view mirror—anywhere.<br /><br />

				I&#39;ll just quickly add here that for anyone who is interested that Wasabisam and I are working on an &quot;official&quot; astorians.com store that will have a variety of items with an &quot;astorians&quot; theme, and Astoria in general. We thought this can be one fun way that people who are interested can help support this site. We&#39;ll also be adding an unobtrusive donate button to the page sometime soon as well.<br /><br />Wasabisam also has a button design, but we haven&#39;t found a place yet that has a good price on buttons while at the same time giving us a good way to distribute them (centralized shipping of some kind). We&#39;re not sure yet exactly on how we&#39;d do buttons if we ended up putting out one ourselves, but we&#39;re keeping an eye out for an inexpensive, yet good quality option that&#39;s easy for everyone to access.<br /><br />Nonetheless, it&#39;s great to see so much talk related to astoria &quot;accessories&quot; and I hope that we&#39;re able to see some of these ideas actualized soon!

				not that you would get the satisfaction of actually making the buttons by hand, but cafe press (and i&#39;m sure other similar services) offer on-demand buttons. see http://www.cafepress.com/cp/customize/product.aspx?clear=true&amp;no=141 (http://www.cafepress.com/cp/customize/product.aspx?clear=true&amp;no=141) for more info.<br /><br />perhaps this would give an easy payment processing and order fulfilment schema to bring your money-making idea to light?<br /><br />just a thought...
