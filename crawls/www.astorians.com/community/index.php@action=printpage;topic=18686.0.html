				Dear all,<br /><br />My child was just accepted into the <strong>Pre-K program</strong> at P.S. 85 (Judge Charles Vallone) As great as this is, I now need to find an after school program. I believe school is out at 1:30 pm and am aware of a program at P.S. 85 but it&#039;s only for kindergarten on up. I need to find a nurturing place in the area that can pick my child up from school and that stays open till 6 pm. I have found several local programs, (Mushroom etc.) but they cannot pick my child up and I don&#039;t want to use a bus program because of several horror stories. <br /><br />I apologize for my long-winded explanation but I am in need of help and would greatly appreciate yours.<br /><br />Thank you!

				Are there any parents with a child at P.S. 85 whom would pickup my son and take him to Mushroom House Day Care on 36th and Ditmars? <br /><br />I would off course compensate you for your time.

				Trust me you are not alone in this matter.&nbsp; My daughter is going to go to Kid Krazy for Pre K in the fall becuase they have an afterschool.&nbsp; But once she goes to kindergarten we are planning on hiring a sitter to pick her up after school and stay with her until we get home.&nbsp; Have you tried Care.com.?&nbsp; This is a website that has a bunch of available sitters in your area.<br /><br />Good luck.

				Thanks for the information!&nbsp; &nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />Is Kid Krazy willing to pick up your daughter? I&#039;m very frustrated with this because what seemed simple has become anything but. I don&#039;t want to have a Nannie at our home because I&#039;m not all that trusting of a stranger. Having my son picked up by a reputable daycare puts my mind at ease somewhat. I have found an option and am yet to see the center but they seem to be my only option and I feel that paying $250 a week for basically four hours a day is a bit steep.<br /><br />I wish you luck for next year.

				917, <br />we went through the same thing last year picking our son up from kindergarten.. basically you have to arrange transportation on your own.&nbsp; We ended up with a babysitter instead.&nbsp; Next year we plan to enroll him in Serious Fun, but we&#039;ll still have to pay for transportation to get him there.&nbsp; <br /><br />I believe Grace Lutheran school takes kids afterschool, like Kid Krazy, but there again, I don&#039;t think they provide transportation.&nbsp; <br /><br />Good luck, and please let us know what you find -- you&#039;re not the only parent in this quandary!

				Offering another option...<br /><br />Immaculate Conception school has openings for the fall.&nbsp; I found that paying the tuition ($440/month) and afterschool ($75/week) actually ended up being <strong>cheaper </strong> than sending my daughter to the public school and having to pay for a nanny after school. <br /><br />My bill for IMMAC is only ~$750 per month, versus a sitter for 4 hours a day,5 days a week at $15/hour = $1200 per month.&nbsp; It sound like you&#039;re looking at $1000 a month for afterschool at Mushroom, which is more expensive than IMMAC too.<br /><br />Immaculate Conception has other things going for it too, like great test scores, warm nurturing environment, small class sizes, etc., but the fact that it&#039;s inexpensive and offers care from 8:00 AM to 6:00 pm is a HUGE selling point.<br />
