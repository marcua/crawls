				Hello all,<br /><br />I am looking to return to college at the ripe, old age of 25.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have much experience with college, so I&#039;m going to start at a community college and possibly work my way towards a university.&nbsp; I will most likely focus on journalism and possibly psychology.<br /><br />I know there are many community colleges in New York City, but I don&#039;t know any of them specifically.&nbsp; Can anyone name some NYC community colleges?&nbsp; Can anyone recommend any as being particularly good?&nbsp; Can anyone recommend any based upon a personal experience there?&nbsp; Really, any help or advice would be swell.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thank you kindly.

				Probably depends on what you want to study. Nearby there is Laguardia Community College in LIC. They sometimes have open houses just for folks like you. Check their website or the local library.

				I went to BMCC, Borough of Manhattan Community College and really disliked it. I found the staff, including most instructors disagreeable and far from helpful.<br /><br />After getting my AA at BMCC, I went to Lehman College (also CUNY) in the Bronx for my Bachelor&#039;s degree and had the exact opposite experience. It was an amazing school and often consider going back there to take random classes because I loved it so much.<br /><br />You may be able to get directly into a 4 year CUNY college instead of going to a CC first. Look into it, I think it&#039;d be worth it. Hunter and Baruch are also supposed to be amazing schools.<br /><br />Note: At Lehman many of my professors were also teaching at Columbia so I was getting an Ivy League education at a city school.

				I&#039;ve always heard good things about Hunter.&nbsp; Never attended but have friends who have, and they seemed to like it.

				What do you want to major in.&nbsp; That might make a difference on where to go.

				I would most likely major in print journalism.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think City College has a good journalism division, right?&nbsp;

				Lehman has a great journalism program. I got my BA in Communications w/ my concentration in writing for television, therefore I took a lot of journalism courses and they were really great, taught by working journalists. I don&#039;t personally know about City College&#039;s journalism program.
