				I woke up at 4 am on Monday morning to the dreadful screams of a woman in the street. It almost sounded like she was screaming &quot;attack&quot; in between shrieks. I live in the Crescent Broadway area. It sounded like it was coming from the direction of 23rd street. Did anyone else hear this or was I having a nightmare?

				I didn&#039;t hear that particular one, but we&#039;ve been hearing a lot of female screaming the last couple of nights... same area. Maybe a noisy new neighbor?

Screaming, fighting, and other stuff that just gets ignored. On 33rd avenue area streets, going from 29th past area you mention, every saturday or friday night there is either a fight, an attack, or a woman screaming, and nothing happens----no cops for example.&nbsp; It&#039;s a dead street (lots of residents, but not much pedestrians, no stores at all)
