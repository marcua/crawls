				Sorry all. I just have to vent.&nbsp; My brother has been staying with us for the last couple of months since he has been out of the Marines.&nbsp; He was waiting to hear from the NYPD about when he can start academy.&nbsp; He got that call last week and started on Tuesday.&nbsp; So, since he is now officially employed, we started the apartment hunt.&nbsp; We found a place last night that was perfect and they guy said it was our and to come by today with the money.&nbsp; I call him today confirm our appointment and he tells me very nonchalantly the &quot;i have already rented apartment to cousin.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;I am fuming right now and just needed to vent.&nbsp; Anyone else, feel free to do the same.

				I feel bad for you. Unfortunately that is not uncommon. If you can afford to use a broker, I would prob do so. The people at Alexiou Realty are honest and straightforward. George found us our current place and my hubbys apts in the past.

				That happened twice to me when apartment hunting in Astoria. I ended up with Angelica Capital Realty and paid the one month broker fee and there was no hidden agenda. We came. We saw. We mailed money orders to the landlord and showed up, got our keys and signed lease/paid broker later.<br /><br />Sorry you&#039;re having a hard time. It&#039;s not atypical for sure, but you&#039;ll find what you need/want when you keep trying. I had 4 brokers &quot;looking&quot; and saw Angelica&#039;s short, lame Craig&#039;s List ad and had confirmation of the apartment hours later.

				don&#039;t forget to mention to <em><strong>everyone</strong></em> you see for apts, be they broker or owner, that your cousin is a marine vet (im assuming the vet part) and that he is going to be a cop. people like that.
