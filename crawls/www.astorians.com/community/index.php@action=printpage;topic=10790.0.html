				So what has everyone been doing for meals in this heat? I have eaten salads, bought precooked chickens even have made omelette&#039;s, but I am getting bored with these options. I am trying not too use my oven- stove top is okay doesn&#039;t seem to heat the place up too much. <br /><br />Wish I had access to a grill. :-(

And I have been cooking or reheating pretty much every meal, stove and oven both. It might seem crazy to do it in this heat, but I find that the apartment feels about 40% cooler afterwards, so I don&#039;t mind it much. Plus when something is on the fire, I just go over and stand directly in front of the a/c to cool off.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Yesterday I ate the leftover spaghetti with olive oil and garlic, Italian sausage on the side. &nbsp;I made a big salad for my BF, plopped canned tuna over it, tossed in some garbanzo beans, feta, olives, croutons, olive oil. He loved it, but unfortunately in this heat we both didn&#039;t have much of an appetite.<br /><br />I did make smoothies for us-very refreshing! <br /><br />Today feels hotter and more unbearable than yesterday, so maybe we&#039;ll just eat a whole watermelon for dinner!!<br />

				Thanks for the suggestions. I have been living on watermelon and strawberries too. Might get something delivered tonight for a change. <br /><br />I had a George Forman Grill- which was ok. It has since broke and I never bothered to replace it as it took up a lot of counter space- something which is limited in my apartment. PJ what kind of indoor grill do you have?

				Speaking of indoor grills, I love love love the Cuisinart griddler.&nbsp; B/c in addition to the grill you get the panini press and griddle.&nbsp; Actually, a panini would be a great meal suggestion... ;)

				I&#039;ve been making pita pizzas in my toaster oven.&nbsp; The toaster oven is the best device for when it&#039;s hot.<br />Also, I frown on indoor grills, and while i have one, I almost never use my grill pan.
