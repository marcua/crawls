			<strong>ladywithpans</strong>:
			<br />
			Last year I played trivia at the NYC Trivia League trivia nights for a while. I joined informally whatever teams I could find. My knowledge complemented the knowledge of my teammates, and at Oliver&#039;s on Monday nights, I brought my team to third place.<br /><br />Tonight I went to Oliver&#039;s, and nobody, but nobody would let me on their team. When I got home I reviewed my email and learned that prior registration was required.<br /><br />Would anyone like to register for a team with me?
