								<div class="inner" id="msg_254675">When I saw this question originally, it made me think of the Time Out NY cover in 1999 that announced that Astoria was the next place to be. It took 16 years for me to meet a couple who lived in Brooklyn at the Ditmars Astoria Bier and Cheese (locally owned), who told me that they had come to Astoria because Lonely Planet had told them that Queens was the #1 destination for 2015. I was barely able to contain my laughter as I gave them directions to SriPraPhai, the next place on their list to visit in Queens.<br /><br />Williamsburg really isn&#039;t a good comparison to Astoria in any sense. Large swathes of Williamsburg were abandoned or gutted, unlike Astoria. Astoria has always had a strong middle class population, even in the &#039;70s, unlike Williamsburg, or even parts of Park Slope (remember when 9th St. in Park Slope was edgy? The abandoned buildings along 6th Avenue? Beyond that -- remember when Pierrepont St. in Brooklyn Heights had SROs??). (Aside - <span style="font-family: verdana;" class="bbc_font">Brooklyn Kitchen, which would seem to be an uber-hipster kind of joint, has a really passionate owner who lives in and is invested in his community. I don&#039;t find that sort of commitment to be &quot;insanely dull&quot;.)</span><br /><br />Like CJ, I&#039;m not an Astoria native, but I&#039;ve lived here for over 16 years, and have been spending most of my time here for over 23. I&#039;m part of a family that has been here since the 1920s, some of whom have moved away, but many of whom have lived here all along. Most of them are pretty happy with Astoria these days. A few years ago, everyone was bemoaning all of the nail salons and banks, which I get. Now, restaurants have been added to the list. <span style="font-family: verdana;" class="bbc_font">Of </span><span style="font-family: verdana;" class="bbc_font">course, there are long time stores, more and more, it seems recently, that I miss. Delis, hardware stores, pork stores, and more. There&#039;s a picture of me standing on Ditmars and 35th in about 1994 -- I think the only place that hasn&#039;t changed is Ferrari cleaners. My mother-in-law remembers King Penny. It may be the only store left on that stretch of Ditmars from 60 years ago.</span><br /><br />But, I agree with Eamonn - there are also lots of new places to shop as well, and more interesting places all around - far more than there were 5 or 10 years ago. And I&#039;m with megc -- soundbites can make for interesting reading, but they don&#039;t convey what&#039;s really happening. I know of quite a few new places that have been opened by Astoria natives or long-time residents who care deeply about their neighborhood. And even some places opened by newcomers who think it&#039;s a great neighborhood and want to contribute to it.<br /><br />But there&#039;s this -- Astoria&#039;s a real neighborhood. Walking down the street on the weekend, I revel in how many people I see that I know, how many friends I run into. On my block, I know my neighbors. This hasn&#039;t lessened as years have passed; it&#039;s grown. I meet people on the streets and in restaurants and in shops. It&#039;s pretty great. It&#039;s not dull, pretentious, or gentrified. It&#039;s life.<br /><br />Total aside - AlexNYC -- a great local place to shop for shoes (and fun accessories) is the Brass Owl, on Ditmars between 36th and 37th. I have absolutely no connection to it aside from being a very happy, satisfied customer.</div>

Those artists and creative population that lived there were there specifically because it was cheap. Neighborhoods change. In the case of most neighborhoods in NYC they have become more expensive because the city is now much more desirable. Gentrification didn&#039;t ruin anything. Its the natural progression of a neighborhood and city changing. They are like any other living, breathing thing. I don&#039;t look like I did when I was 20 years old. Williamsburg doesn&#039;t look like it did 20 years go, just like it looked different 50 years ago and 100 years ago it was one of the most happening places when the train was first expanded there. These &quot;gentrification/artist/greed/used-to-be-cool&quot; conversations sound like the rants of a person who has no concept of reality. </div>

What I&#039;m talking about is the comparison between the actually &quot;hip&quot; Williamsburg populated by lower-wage people, many of whom at one point were true artists, or aspiring artists. Sports bars, Duane Reades, Starbucks, real estate offices etc is all insanely dull to me. Compared to meeting up with artists in a converted space for something truly unique that type of living is dull.

Those artists and creative population that lived there were there specifically because it was cheap. Neighborhoods change. In the case of most neighborhoods in NYC they have become more expensive because the city is now much more desirable. Gentrification didn&#039;t ruin anything. Its the natural progression of a neighborhood and city changing. They are like any other living, breathing thing. I don&#039;t look like I did when I was 20 years old. Williamsburg doesn&#039;t look like it did 20 years go, just like it looked different 50 years ago and 100 years ago it was one of the most happening places when the train was first expanded there. These &quot;gentrification/artist/greed/used-to-be-cool&quot; conversations sound like the rants of a person who has no concept of reality.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Your argument is actually not logical. I have a suspicion that regardless of what I say you won&#039;t see that though.<br /><br />Just because gentrification is inevitable (which is what you imply) and is therefore just a part of life (all paraphrased) doesn&#039;t mean it didn&#039;t ruin what was cool in Williamsburg. Do you see what I mean? The inevitability of gentrification says nothing about its effects. Heck, you even acknowledge it yourself when you say that artists lived there because it was cheap, and then tacitly acknowledge they moved because things got more expensive. That&#039;s gentrification. <br /><br />Money moves in, artists move out.<br /><br />You like it, it seems. I don&#039;t.<br /><br />As for your quip about &quot;concept of reality&quot;; that&#039;s just silly. If you read what I wrote I even stated pretty clearly that it is expected to happen. Again, me not liking reality isn&#039;t the same thing as denying reality. Logic 101.</div>

I think the contribution of artists, directly or indirectly, to society is generally incredibly misunderstood and insufficiently appreciated.

The perspective of the working class isn&#039;t the same as that of the artist, but all people consume culture and art, one way or another.

It was an affordable place to live and work. It wasn&#039;t the desire of artists and musicians to bring in hipsters and later the general public (with greater means). They all just wanted to live and work there. They all suffered from that gentrification for the reason you mention. But don&#039;t blame artists for it, blame everyone who contributes to the price hikes. </div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_254689"><span style="font-family: arial;" class="bbc_font"><span style="font-size: small;" class="bbc_size">Once upon a time you could go clothes and shoe shopping on Ditmars and most of the other avenues in Astoria. You still can on Steinway, though by some of the opinions voiced on this forum in other threads, what’s on offer may not suit everyone’s taste. </span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: arial;" class="bbc_font">Who remembers Weber’s, Famous Fashion/Susan Terry, Astoria Bootery, Genovese, Woolworth’s?</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: arial;" class="bbc_font">Most of these types of stores closed way before, many of you were born. It wasn’t because of rising rents or gentrification it was because most people didn’t like what the mom and pop stores had to offer and started to shop in national chains, in shopping malls, which they could drive to.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: arial;" class="bbc_font">So it amazes me when people today complain about not being able to buy or a shirt or pair of shoes (or a pot or pan for that matter) on Ditmars. You could at one time but people didn’t so the stores went out of business.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: arial;" class="bbc_font">If you live long enough, and live in one place a long time, you can see changes as part of life. You may not like them but they are a part of life and one can accept and adapt, or not.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: arial;" class="bbc_font">For some businesses, the owners are older, ready to retire and find themselves with either no one to take over or sell the business to, so they shut down. Yes, rising rents/costs are a major factor but not always. Some also can’t adapt or compete to a new demographic or today’s retail landscape but often it’s just a case of being tired.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: arial;" class="bbc_font">How many of you want to work 12+ hours a day, seven days a week? It ain’t easy.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: arial;" class="bbc_font">For anyone who makes a go at it whether it be a coffee shop, restaurant, or salon (because cash businesses are the only ones that can survive) I salute them and can’t understand frankly why people complain about the type of business opening because the alternative would be empty shops. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: arial;" class="bbc_font">My family has been in Astoria for a long time. We owned several businesses. My parents, aunts and uncles worked like dogs so that we didn’t have to. None of the businesses were taken over by the next generation. Some were sold and continued on for many years under new owners. All have since ceased operation. I can tell you right now, it wasn’t gentrification, or at least how I define it.</span><br />&nbsp;</div>

They are the original hipsters (god I hate that word).</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />They&#039;re not though. There&#039;s a huge difference between a hipster and an artist/musician. The way I see it artists and musicians came to Williamsburg clearly before hipsters started showing up. These weren&#039;t the tight-pants-and-facial-hair sporting crowd, but people who could barely afford rent, therefore lived in small collectives, and lived on noodles.... so to speak. The hipster crowd is, the way I see it, those who have clearly higher disposable income, dress in &quot;hip&quot; but not inexpensive clothing, and prefer to live in good apartments rather than a converted warehouse. They might be working in media, but they aren&#039;t necessarily artists. So you might find some designers or what have you, but whereas the hipster might take a good job at a real estate firm an artist or musician at heart would rather suffocate slowly to death.<br /><br />Hipsters are pretend-artists. They are all different and unique in exactly the same way. Where a musician might buy vinyl to use in production of anything from hip-hop beats to electronica to &quot;art music&quot; the hipster buys it because it&#039;s hip, in and cool. It&#039;s different, and it&#039;s cool to be different, even if every other hipster is it the same way. And where an artist screws up their own jeans because they were done for anyway and they couldn&#039;t afford new ones a hipster is more likely to seek out a boutique that sells already distressed stuff to make it look like they&#039;re the same.<br /><br />I can see how some would confuse hipsters and artists, but they&#039;re really not the same animal.<br /><br />And <em>then</em> you have the regular crowd show up once the convenient franchises have populated the neighborhood.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=39136.msg254688.html#msg254688">Quote from: 28Grand on January 21, 2016, 03:34:18 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">My point was/is everyone is affected by rising rents, including, not just artists. In neighborhoods like Astoria, who lanseaux quite rightly pointed out was always solidly working and middle class (as was Park Slope by the way) people are being displaced.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I absolutely agree with you. And I didn&#039;t mean to complain on behalf of artists only, I only meant to use artists and Williamsburg as an example of a progression we&#039;ve seen in this city several times.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=39136.msg254688.html#msg254688">Quote from: 28Grand on January 21, 2016, 03:34:18 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Sorry, I don&#039;t think artists are any more special than anyone else and don&#039;t have any more rights than anyone else to a decent place to live. Like you said, we are all interdependent. We are all affected.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I don&#039;t entirely disagree, although I think the term &quot;rights&quot; is really poorly chosen. I also think that a world without lawyers would be bearable, whereas one without artists would not. Similarly to how a world without firemen would suck whereas one without politicians wouldn&#039;t..... relatively speaking.... So yeah, I think there is a difference, and I apparently value different types of labor differently. But if we want to be literal about what you wrote then no group is indeed any more special than any other.</div>

Some of my favorite places have closed down but there were always others to fill their place, or new places to enjoy and hopefully become &quot;old&quot; places. <br /><br />For the most part, there still are but recently (in the past year) some businesses I used to rely on heavily, real stalwarts, have closed and without being too dramatic, it&#039;s been a blow to me. I have to be honest though, part of what I&#039;ve been feeling is directly related to getting older.<br /><br />It&#039;s like, my favorite diner closed ...am I next to go?? <br /><br />It&#039;s ridiculous but that&#039;s how I&#039;ve been feeling. Plus, in the last year the very last of the aunts and uncles past away and now I&#039;m the part of the old generation. Part of me is scared but I&#039;ve decided to take advantage of the opportunity to develop an affectation and become a character. <br /><br />Maybe you&#039;ll see me at along the avenue one day and blog or write into the New York Times Metropolitan Diary about the old-timer you met on the street who behaved outrageously (and kindly as well). I can only hope I live up to the standards set by my family and nutty neighbors who came before me.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_254693">I think most people are missing the point. Astoria has gotten better. It&#039;s more exciting and there&#039;s more things to do compared to the year 1990 let&#039;s say. Back then you had to go to Manhattan to party, go dancing, etc... for coffee you had to go to Greek cafes like Omonia or go to a diner. The problem now it two fold. Massive population influx that has raised the cost of living, rent is through the roof and food so expensive. SO now you either have to have a HIGH paying job to enjoy and take full advantage of what Astoria has to offer or move to a cheaper neighborhood. It&#039;s no longer affordable. It&#039;s becoming an UES or basically ever other neighborhood in Manhattan. That my friends is the reality. </div>

Astoria has gotten better. It&#039;s more exciting and there&#039;s more things to do compared to the year 1990 let&#039;s say. Back then you had to go to Manhattan to party, go dancing, etc... for coffee you had to go to Greek cafes like Omonia or go to a diner. The problem now it two fold. Massive population influx that has raised the cost of living, rent is through the roof and food so expensive. SO now you either have to have a HIGH paying job to enjoy and take full advantage of what Astoria has to offer or move to a cheaper neighborhood. It&#039;s no longer affordable. It&#039;s becoming an UES or basically ever other neighborhood in Manhattan. That my friends is the reality.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This happened to my friend.&nbsp; She was renting an apartment and the owner sold the house.&nbsp; She had to move and couldn&#039;t afford to live in Astoria anymore.&nbsp; It&#039;s sad</div>
