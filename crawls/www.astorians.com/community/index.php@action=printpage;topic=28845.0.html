				I don&#039;t know of any purely soup places but are there places near Steinway between Astoria blvd and Broadway that have good soups?&nbsp; (preferably not too salty).&nbsp; Down with a winter cold and missing the midtown soup places.

				Zenon Taverna at 34-10 31st Avenue makes excellent<strong> Avgolemono soup</strong>, which is a Greek chicken and rice soup with lemon, eggs and veggies. It&#039;s excellent for when you have a cold. Order the larger size bowl to go. <br /><br />http://zenontaverna.com/ (http://zenontaverna.com/)<br /><br />Also, Brooklyn Bagels with stores on both Broadway and 30th Avenue also carry soups by Hale &amp; Hearty.<br /><br />Hope you&#039;re feeling better soon.

				The avgolemono at Crave on 30th Avenue &amp; 36th Street is quite good, and they deliver (GrubHub/Seamless). It&#039;s been a go-to when I&#039;ve been sick in the past.<br /><br /><br />Other than that, I agree there&#039;s not much in the way of soups to soothe someone with a bug. If you&#039;re inclined that way, Thai soups might be very tasty and comforting.<br /><br /><br />Feel better soon!

				Why not make some simple Japanese soup yourself? Buy some miso paste ( I lke Miko miso with dashi), wakame dried seaweed and tofu. Add 2 Tbsp miso paste to 2 or 3 cups water, simmer few minutes, add chopped tofu, and rehydrated wakame (place a little wakame in bowl, add water, let&nbsp; sit until thoroughly moist, drain water, use) simmer a few more minutes. Makes a great warming winter soup. Optional: garnish with chopped green scallions. Not too filling, but very warming and comforting.

				It&#039;s a trekking adventure for soups in Astoria, especially if you want something beyond avgolemone - here are some suggestions<br />- NY Bagel on 23rd Ave - call ahead to check daily selection but New England Clam Chowder and Hungarian Mushroom are excellent<br />- Bartolinos on Broadway - best stratachella in town IMO<br />- Kholiba on 23rd Ave - garlic soup has both cheese and an egg in it - pure wow - and their onion soup is also good (up the block from NY Bagel)<br />- Titan grocery - in the fridge section check out the lentil and yogurt/barley soups to go<br />- Create on 30th avenue - nearly always great, not starchy<br /><br />

				I like the Tom Kha soup at Bangkok Tasty (coconut milk base). I also think that somehow Soho Cafe and Grill near Ditmars consistently has very good lentil soup. The garlic soup with egg yolk and cheese at Koliba is pretty great, too.

Bangkok Tasty is probably my favorite Thai-American spot on the neighborhood (for Thai-Thai I got to Pye Boat Noodle). Was just there the other day and everything was delicious, especially the Nam Sod, which I hadn&#039;t had before. I love all the kaffir lime leaf they use in various dishes, too.

				Though these aren&#039;t designated soup places, Sanford&#039;s on Broadway has a pretty good Chicken &amp; Orzo soup, and Sugar Freak on 30th Ave. has a really great Gumbo. It&#039;s a little pricey at $10, but I still think it pretty good.

				Many years ago, people used to go crazy about the soup at Il Bambino. I never tried any of their soup, but I think there was actually a thread on astorians.com about what flavor soup they were serving each day. I don&#039;t even know if they still serve soup, but you may want to check.
