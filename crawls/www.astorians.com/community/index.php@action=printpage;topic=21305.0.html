				It&#039;s been my experience that basement apartments with utilities included are most times illegal (and potentially unsafe) conversions.<br /><br />Renters beware.<br /><br />

				Thanks for your concern but this is a legal apartment in our 2 family house.&nbsp; If you are interested in our apt, please PM me and I can give you the address.<br /><br />PS You can check to see if an apt is legal or not by looking at the Certificate of Occupancy (CO), available to anyone at the Department of Buildings website as part of their Buildings Information System&nbsp; In order to get a CO, you have to pass a plumbing, electrical and structural inspection and have DOB approved plans on file.<br /><br />To look at a CO go to:<br />&nbsp;<br />http://www.nyc.gov/html/dob/html/bis/bis.shtml<br /><br />On the right side of the screen type in the borough, house number and street name.<br /><br />It will bring up all the permit and certificate information.&nbsp; Then click on Certificate of Occupancy and it will bring up a PDF.<br /><br />You can use this system to see that work was approved, also look at whether the building ever had a violation, if it passed its inspections, etc.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Hi! I think we could live with a quiet dog if you were interested in renting it unfurnished.<br /><br />We think we will have an open house on Saturday afternoon, we just want to check with the current tenant because her things are still in the apt and we want to be respectful.&nbsp; If you are interested, please PM me and I can give you more details.<br /><br />Thx!<br /><br />Sylvia<br />
