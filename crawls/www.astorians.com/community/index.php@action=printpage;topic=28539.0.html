				In my travels around the web this week looking for all things Astoria, I found this article from the Republican Herald of Pottsville Pennsylvania: <br />http://republicanherald.com/news/relatives-of-designer-visit-mother-s-memorial-statue-1.1778304 <br /><br /><br />The article describes a visit to a sculpture, Mother’s memorial in Ashville PA by the relatives of the designer Emil Stiebern, who was an Greenwich Village based artist known for his works in public buildings and spaces in New York and elsewhere. <br /><br /><br />The interesting part of this is that the article mentions that he designed a work that stood in ‘Prospect Park’ in Astoria. This intrigued me (aside from the fact that Prospect Park is in Brooklyn). I dug around some more and it turns out that he designed two large stainless steel Sentinel-like sculptures that stood on the top deck and overlooked Astoria Pool. <br /><br /><br />Here is a picture:<br />http://collections.mcny.org/Collection/Astoria-Pool.-2F3XC5UJWITZ.html&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />For some reason, I’m a bit obsessed now. Does anyone know more about these sculptures and what happened to them?<br />&nbsp;<br />Other links:<br />http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/cunningham-park/monuments/354 <br />http://norman.hrc.utexas.edu/bookshopdoor/signature.cfm?item=145#1

				You&#039;re welcome! Those statues were beautiful, but after all that work they only lasted about 6 years. <br />Why the hell do they call it stainless steel then?! Perhaps the sheets used were quite thin, or somehow moisture seeped in? They used so many individual pieces (125!) welded together, the joints failed somehow? Interesting...<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				So interesting!! Thanks for posting!&nbsp; I never knew about these sculptures.&nbsp; They must have been a sight to see!&nbsp; Sad that they didn&#039;t stand the test of time.

				Shame they were melted down. I gather they were too expensive to maintain. I have this idea that the top deck of the pool could be used as a rotating art installation with different statutes or other pieces of art appearing every summer.

				They better be small installations and they&#039;ll have to build a fence around them because some knucklehead would climb it, fall, injure themselves and sue the city for millions.
