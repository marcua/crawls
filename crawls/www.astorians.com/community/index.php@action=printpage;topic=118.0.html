				It's an afternoon (or evening) in early December. The Christmas rush isn't upon us just yet but it looms ahead on the horizon. &nbsp;You're knitting a scarf for your brother's ex-mother in law's nephen when...<br /><br />You've just moved into a great new apartment, a little bit of a fixer upper but great non-theless. &nbsp;You've got great ideas for faux-fresco walls but aren't quite sure what to do with the lingering remnants of 50 year old wallpaper all but superglued to the plaster underneath when...<br /><br />You cook, you clean, you know all about Martha's tips and tricks, and you've just put the icing on your seven layer butter cream molten chocolate fudge cake. &nbsp;The party favor packets are assembled next to a cleverly set table and you want nothing more than to show it off pre-party for some ooo's and aaa's when...<br /><br />You've got to head out the door at head to the Freeze Peach where the group for clever crafty dyi-ers (and some knitters too) is getting together! &nbsp;<br /><br />We'll meet once a week to share tips, tricks, and new ideas. &nbsp;We'll sympathize with your glue gun burns, give you pointers on how to pick up those dropped stitches, and do a little show-and-tell.<br /><br />Interested? &nbsp;Email me jayme@nurbn.com include please (if you'd like) project ideas. &nbsp;I'll be sending around an annoucement as to the particulars to interested parties.
