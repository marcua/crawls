				I&#039;m trying to stay away from soda!&nbsp; I was drinking diet soda, but I don&#039;t like the flavor, although Sprite Zero isn&#039;t too bad.&nbsp; I found myself drinking an unhealthy amount of the carbonated, flavored sugar water and I&#039;m still trying to find a cheap, but tasty alternative.&nbsp; I drink plenty of water, by the way, during the day.

				There seems to be more active carbonation in the Coke, as well as more potent Phosphoric Acid to tear away at my tooth enamel.&nbsp; Yeah, Passover Coke is a great find.&nbsp; Too bad I don&#039;t see price reductions for the brand any longer.<br /><br />- Cannibal

				If it&#039;s fountain soda, either. Mmmmm, fountain soda. My fav.<br /><br />But if it&#039;s in a bottle or can, Coke. Or Diet Coke with Lime (http://www.bevnet.com/news/2004/01-14-2004-dietcokelime.asp) (like, the product, not DC with a lime wedge). Bottled Pepsi seems way too sweet/syrupy for me.<br />

				In the good old days when vanilla Coke had sugar in it, that was the beverage.&nbsp; Now if I find a naturally flavored root beer or birch beer at Sai&#039;s, I&#039;ll quaff it, but otherwise I avoid the sweetened sodas.

				Whether it&#039;s true or not, Coke tastes more acidic to me, like I can feel my teeth dissolving as I drink it, so I prefer Pepsi of the two.&nbsp; But I actually have been drinking more Coke Zero than anything.&nbsp; I also drink Diet A&amp;W Root Beer, perhaps my favorite of the sodas, but you can&#039;t find that everywhere, so usually I stick with Coke Zero, Pepsi, or Manzana Postobon (apple-flavored Colombian drink).

				I&#039;m not a big soda drinker at all.&nbsp; If I do have it, it&#039;s ginger ale, especially for an upset stomach.&nbsp; But otherwise, I&#039;ve successfully trained my mind to believe soda&#039;s completely bad for me, just like hot dogs, twinkies and similar ho ho&#039;s, and fast food.&nbsp; So bad, my mind has been tricked into believing they taste awful.<br /><br />I just wish I could do that with ice cream, chocolate, and pizza.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-P

				Diet Coke, it&#039;s my favorite drink, though Diet Cherry Coke comes in a close second.&nbsp; I wish more places carried that.&nbsp; Diet Lime Coke is good, but I think it goes bad quickly as you occasionally get a bottle that just tastes off (anyone else experience that?)

				Best Yet (37th St just above 20th Ave...aka the bestest supermarket in Astoria) has Pepsi Throwback AND Mountain Dew Throwback! I didn&#039;t know that the Mountain Dew had a little guy cartoon on it! I only noticed the Dew in the 12-pack of cans, though there may have been 2L bottles, I don&#039;t remember. I&#039;ll check it out next time I&#039;m there (probably this weekend).<br /><br />If you&#039;re in south Astoria, you can take the Q101 and get off at 20th Ave if you don&#039;t feel like walking.

				Since New Years Day I&#039;ve been seeking out first the Mountain Dew, then the Pepsi Throwbacks.&nbsp; They were both less intense than the current corn sweetened brew; just a bit gentler on my systems.<br /><br />On another matter, I was briefly addicted to brazilian Mate Couro in the thinner 2 liter bottles from the Brazilian store on 36th Avenue.&nbsp; They&#039;ve stopped carrying it, so I&#039;ve got to find another source.

				Hmmm, it&#039;s that time of year again.&#160; At Passover the bottlers go Kosher.&#160; I was in Pathmark 2day, and they had the Coke 2 liter bottles with the bright yelllow caps and the K markings that denote CANE SUGAR.&#160; I guess this separates the need for Pepsi Throwback with the only times of year you get Coke throwback.&#160; I also saw some of the Pepsi flavors (Sierra Mist, etc) with different markings.&#160; You get to briefly ENJOY!

				Interesting experiment discussed in the book Blink!&nbsp; Have somebody pour you 3 glasses of Coke and Pepsi - two of one and one of the other - and try to determine which is the one that is different.&nbsp; It is said that it&#039;s very difficult to determine which is which is the different one when compared in this three way test.&nbsp; I find that hard to believe because I think they taste very different, but I haven&#039;t tried the experiment.

				Coke.&nbsp; I found the Mexican Coke with cane sugar at Costco down in Jersey.&nbsp; The difference in the taste between that and the high fructose stuff is amazing.&nbsp; As soon as I took a sip, I got one of those memory jog things (like you get when you smell something from the past) that instantly took me back to having a Coke after delivering my papers when I was a kid.&nbsp; Very cool.&nbsp; I also tried the Pepsi Throwback and it wasn&#039;t bad.&nbsp; Don&#039;t really like the regular Pepsi though.&nbsp; Doc Brown&#039;s is always good.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to see a Fresca throwback.&nbsp; BTW, I paid about 20 bucks for a case of 24 12oz. Mexican Coke at the Jersey Costco.&nbsp; There&#039;s a theory going around that kids are overweight nowadays because they don&#039;t drink real sugar soft drinks or regular milk.&nbsp; The theory goes something along the lines that fat and sugar are something the body needs and when it doesn&#039;t get it, one will drink more or the HFCS or Low Fat product to compensate.&nbsp; Haven&#039;t the faintest idea if it&#039;s true or not, but sounds as good as any other theory out there.&nbsp; Cheers (Pilsner Urquell right now) !
