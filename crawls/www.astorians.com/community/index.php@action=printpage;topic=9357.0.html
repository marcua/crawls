				I&#039;m looking for a thrift store that has lots of other things <em>besides</em> clothing. I&#039;m looking to shop for housewares (cooking equipment, tableware, etc) and household items(decor, art, etc) and I have some clothing to donate. Different places are ok for this. <br /><br />I&#039;ve dropped some stuff off at the thrift store on Ditmars between 31st and 33rd, but never looked around. Do they have household stuff? Any other recommendations? I&#039;m thinking of some place like Housing Works in Manhattan, with good prices, as opposed to a Goodwill or something that mostly has clothes and toys. Anything local?

				The Second Best Thrift Shop over on Astoria Blvd by the train may have this.&nbsp; The owner will also look for things if you ask her as they are constantly going to estate sales.<br /><br />Craigslist may have some stuff as well.

				The Salvation Army (corner of Steinway and 34th Ave.) has a small housewares section. The Goodness Gracious Thrift Shoppe (on 30th Ave. at 31st St.) might be worth checking out as well, though its hours can be irregular.

				You may also want to try Nook and Cranny on Ditmars off of 29th St. They have a lot of really awesome second hand stuff, although some items are pricey.

				I wouldn&#039;t call nook &amp; cranny a second hand store, but rather a vintage goods shop where a dresser from the 50&#039;s will cost you a cool $950!!

				The ABC Super Store on 31st, a little walk up from the Ditmars intersection has a decent amount of furniture and housewares at a pretty low cost.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s considered a thrift store or simply a discount store, or if they&#039;re one in the same.
