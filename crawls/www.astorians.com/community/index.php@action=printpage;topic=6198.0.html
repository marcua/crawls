				Wow, Heff, you took it way back! &nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>The Single Guy</strong> with Steve Martin. &nbsp;I was sitting on my futon watching Saturday afternoon movies (still wish they had the kung fool flicks on Sat. and I need to see Running Scared on a Sat. or Sun. soon) when I heard 31st Street being referenced and it was underneath an L track. &nbsp;I had asked the members if this was in fact shot in LIC and someone said &quot;yes.&quot; &nbsp;<br /><br />Don&#039;t forget &quot;Ransom&quot; by the way! &nbsp;I don&#039;t want to spoil the movie, but they shot a bunch of scenes on 18th Street and Astoria Boulevard.

				My Super Ex Girlfriend, with Luke Wilson and Uma Thurman was filmed around 30th ave and 44th st, at least parts of it were, last summer.&nbsp; I remember seeing crews and no parking signs on my way to work.&nbsp; That movie looked horrible, so I never bothered with it, and therefore have no idea if any shots of Astoria made it into the final cut. <br />Also Quiz Show is one of my favorite movies of all time.

				IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU (Nicholas Cage &amp; Bridget Fonda - Steinway Street)<br /><br />QUEENS LOGIC <br /><br />I also saw the MUNICH last night and the last scene was shot by the new buildings in LIC...I had to chuckle at the very &#039;00&#039;s style of the fence at the river, BUT note the added silhouette of the WTC (for the period and to the point of the scene.).<br /><br />And yes, even though there&#039;s no scenery, you have to count that most of the early Marx Brothers movies were filmed at Kaufman Astoria Studios while they were performing on Broadway at night. It was there that one director got so tired of their shenanigans that he had them caged.<br /><br />As for tv, 36th street is (literally) SESAME STREET.<br /><br />NOTE: if any of you are near to the area, don&#039;t miss the museum at the studio...Great!<br />

				Obviously you never saw the Bronx Tale where 3oth AVenue was like a giant Backlot for all the films exteriors, which supposedly was 1950&#039;s Bronx. 1950&#039;s the Bronx neighborhood depicted burned down years ago. <br /><br />Quiz Show - The Church on 33 St Parrish was a sub for Columbia University in quick exterior shots. It was a cheaper and easier shoot and I wouldn&#039;t question the director Robert Redford for one minute<br /><br /><br />There are a million examples - it&#039;s the Movies - OK - and I do believe everything shot here in Astoria trickles down in our burgs local economy,<br />jobs, catering, bar business etc. and adds to the fun of living here.

				A scene from Woody Allen&#039;s &quot;Anything Else&quot; was filmed on 23rd Ave between 31st and 29th St.&nbsp; You can see the N train tracks and Lefkos Pyrgos bakery in the background.&nbsp; He parks a little red convertible right in front of Stamatis restaurant.

				There is a distinction between movies made in Astoria and movies made and set in Astoria.&nbsp; Under the Hellgate Bridge, Astoria and&nbsp; A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints would fall into the latter category.<br /><br />I&#039;m surprised no one has mentioned Kiss of Death, from the late 1940s that featured Richard Widmark as the pyscho of all pyschos.&nbsp; &nbsp;In the film&#039;s most famous scene, Widmark throws a woman in a wheelchair down a flight of stairs.&nbsp; &nbsp;In any event, Victor Mature, the film&#039;s star, lives in Astoria in the movie.&nbsp; &nbsp;They filmed some exterior shots of Mature&#039;s apartment building and they used an apartment on one of the streets just south of Astoria Park because you can see the park and the bridge in the background.

				A couple of others.&nbsp; &nbsp;Munich wasn&#039;t the only movie to use the Gantry Park in Hunter&#039;s Point as a movie backdrop.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think the film was called &quot;The Negotiator&quot; or something like that.&nbsp; &nbsp;It was a lame thriller that came out a couple of years ago that was set in the U.N. and starred Sean Penn &amp; Nicole Kidman.<br /><br />And I&#039;m pretty sure &quot;King of New York,&quot; with Astoria&#039;s own Christopher Walken as part of an ensemble cast, came to Queensborough Plaza and filmed some scenes in those dank areas under the bridge near 21st St.

				The indie film &quot;Room&quot; was in my Netflix queue and some of it was filmed in LIC.&nbsp; &nbsp;There is a nice shot of the protagonist getting off the 7 train at Queensboro Plaza and they use the exterior of the hot sheet motel on Vernon Blvd. hard by the Queensboro Bridge.&nbsp; &nbsp; The lead actress was looking for a loft space that she was seeing&nbsp; in her dreams so ended up in LIC.&nbsp; &nbsp; The real estate agent she hooked up with said &quot;the area is hot.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;Truer words were never spoken.

				There was an indie that used to air on IFC pretty frequently about an English woman who believes that a homeless man she finds in LIC is some reclusive writer and proceeds to follow him around the area.&nbsp; The movie has great location shots of the diners, pubs, factories and city views of the area south of Queensborough Plaza/Bridge.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never actually watched enough of the movie or paid enough attention to the plot to tell the group if it&#039;s any good.&nbsp; <br /><br />Has anyone else ever seen this movie?

				Queen&#039;s Logic with Joe Mantegna was written by a guy from Astoria, about Astoria, and filmed here.&nbsp; &nbsp; A terrible film, Under Hellgate Bridge, is filmed entirerly in Astoria, but is so awful I could not watch whole movie.&nbsp; <br /><br />Queen&#039;s Logic was pretty Good, Guide to Saint&#039;s good --and more authentic for Astoria movie.&nbsp; <br /><br />The first film made at new Kaufman was The Cotton Club, with Richard Gere.&nbsp; The crew and dancers used to come into bar that was across street from studio, and do cocaine with locals till about&nbsp; 6 A:M:<br /><br />I also think Coppola lost reel of final cut of movie in Astoria, outside studio, but that may have been publicity stunt.

				http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084776/ (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084776/)<br />Tempest (1983) by John Cassavetes. There is a scene that lasts for about a minute or two that takes place beginning on 31st street and 23rd avenue, a little before where the Ditmars post office is now. You can clearly see the movie theatre that was there and I believe it follows them walking and talking past the old OTB front and the Twin Donut.<br />This movie had Susan Sarandon, Raul Julia, Molly Ringwald and of course Gena Rowlands.<br />I&#039;m biased, I think it&#039;s a great flick but I don&#039;t know if its because of the Astoria cameo and that I&#039;m half greek. Give it a whirl on Netflix, not bad at all.<br /><br />also not a movie but the opening to All in the Family featured a split second shot of Steinway and Broadway where Lite Bites now resides, it used to be a diner.<br />&nbsp;

				Five Corners (in the mid 1980s) was filmed on 18th Street, between Astoria Blvd and Astoria Park South, and there were a few shots by the pool, Jodi Foster and Tim Robbins were in the film. Not the best film ever made, but not terrible either.
