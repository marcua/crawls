				So I came to Coffee Bar in Astoria for lunch, hoping the hope of the freelancer tired of having to go into the city to have a nice place to have good coffee and work during the day...but alas, my hopes were dashed. Plenty of tables, but no wi-fi, and the nail in the coffin is no plugs...anywhere. <br />On the plus side, the place is clean and bright, the service was friendly, and my steak and cheese panini was quite good (not great). <br /><br />For those of you curious about the menu, it&#039;s pretty basic - for breakfast, they have bagels and schmears, egg &quot;platters,&quot; omelets, waffles. <br />For lunch, salds, paninis, wraps, sandwiches, burgers, and a few &quot;house entrees&quot; like grilled chicken.

				http://astorianyc.blogspot.com/ (http://astorianyc.blogspot.com/)<br />According to Joey in Astoria, this place is open 630am-midnight 7 days a week, so my question, is do their menus revolve or is it one constant menu? In other words, Can I get a bagel at 11pm?

				I tried the coffee last night.&nbsp; I can&#039;t comment on the espresso or cappuccino, but the regular coffee was a bare notch up from generic deli coffee.&nbsp; I should say, though, that I like quite strong coffee, and I drink it black.<br /><br />As for food, we tried a few things.&nbsp; The smoked turkey sandwich was pronounced quite good, if spicy.&nbsp; The fries were thin and crispy (a bit overdone, but not terribly so), burgers were thick, although cooked well-done unless specified otherwise (no one specified, so I don&#039;t know how accurate they would be).&nbsp; The &quot;traditional salad&quot;, described as &quot;mixed greens with croutons, chopped eggs and smoked bacon&quot;, was more like a breakfast salad -- three hard boiled eggs and a tremendous amount of crumbled bacon.&nbsp; Quite tasty, but huge, far more than I expected from the description (not always bad, but I really only wanted a small side salad).&nbsp; The beer selection is anemic (Heineken, Corona, Stella and Sam Adams).<br /><br />The service was a bit chaotic and slow, although they were friendly.&nbsp; We had to ask repeatedly for several items, including napkins, forks and water.&nbsp; Not all the food came out at the same time.&nbsp; A beer was forgotten until late in the meal.&nbsp; I&#039;m assuming these are kinks they will work out, since they just opened. <br /><br />Coffee and several plates of desserts (mostly pastry items -- apple turnover, a chocolate babka relative, fruit cake, a cake with some ricotta) were offered on the house at the end, with smiles and apologies.

				I used to like Zygos. The atmosphere was really nice.&nbsp; I looked in this place and it didn&#039;t look appealing to me and the prices were kind of high.

				I stopped by this place this morning (Sunday) and had a good experience. The guy behind the counter was really friendly, although I could tell they were still working out a good flow. I got an iced coffee and bagel to go, and both were good, if pretty standard.<br /><br />I grabbed a to-go menu and it really has a wide range of sandwiches, wraps, burgers, create-your-own salads, smoothies, and then breakfast foods. The menu also says they have domestic and imported beers.<br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;ll probably go back for coffee on my way to the train some mornings.

Did you really look at the prices? I have their menu right in front of me and the three most &quot;expensive&quot; items on the menu are entrees. One is a 10oz steak for $11.95 that comes with fries. The second is a grilled salmon also $11.95 and the third item, also $11.95 are breaded jumbo shrimp that comes with a tomato &amp; spinach salad. I was passing by on Thursday afternoon after exiting the N from Manhattan and I peeked into it, since I haven&#039;t passed by in a few weeks. I grabbed a menu and walked in looking around at the place. The owner( he introduced himself as the owner) asked me if I wanted anything, which I really didn&#039;t at that moment, so he offers me a free drink. Whichever one I wished. I thought that was pretty nice of him, sort of free advertisement. I will say that one of the workers behind the counter was obviously being trained, but I will be back there since I didn&#039;t really have a chance to taste any food.
