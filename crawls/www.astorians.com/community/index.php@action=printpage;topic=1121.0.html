				Title: <strong>Change of format</strong><br />

				Instead of listening to Episode 44: P.A.T.R.I.O.T. act (http://www.binrev.com/radio/archive/binrev044.mp3)[/color]<br />of <span style="font-size: 18px;" class="bbc_size">BINARY REVOLUTION RADIO</span> (http://www.binrev.com/)<br /><span style="font-size: 12px;" class="bbc_size">We will be listening to a more tech oriented show concerning the interesting license called CEH or Certified Ethical Hacker (http://www.eccouncil.org/CEH.htm).<br />The reasons for this are practical... I didn't think that Episode 44 was as <em>entertaining</em> and yet I urge people who care about their personal freedom to follow the links and listen to it anyway.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12px;" class="bbc_size">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />[Later]: On second thought, I'm not sure if this was a good decision, though I'm still sticking with the change of program, probably against my better instinct. Being a devotee of &quot;Off the Hook&quot; I downloaded and listened to last night's broadcast which coincidentally talked about the <strong>Very</strong> soon to be repassing of the act which again re-alerted me to the Imminent Eclipse. Our Beloved Mr. Bush expects it to appear on his desk by Thanksgiving. If you care to listen to this part, you can download it here (http://www.2600.com/offthehook/mp3files/2005/off_the_hook__20051116.mp3) and fast foward if you wish to 18:50. &quot;Last chance to contact your legislature.&quot;-Bernie S. &nbsp;&amp; &quot;Sunsetted after three years as originally <em>promised</em>&quot; [italics mine]</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12px;" class="bbc_size"><br />As a result of the program, I bumped the P.A.T.R.I.O.T. Act topic on astorians.net with one last attempt at a plea for awakening (I still don't understand the lack of outrage and shock from a so-called &quot;freedom-loving&quot; peoples.) In fact, since the beginning of this thing my paradigm has shifted dramatically. I now realize that many Americans <em>don't</em> in fact value personal freedom, but rather hold in highest esteem: comfort, security, and orgies of the senses... alot like ancient Rome in fact. So follow your conscience and don't say I didn't warn you when you realize that when you take away one person's rights for no valid reason then we all suffer on a very real and experiential level.&lt;/endiatribe&gt;<br /><br />As far as the CEH episode, it is not the first time that Stank talked about this certification. I can tell you that he does have issues with such a thing even after he obtained it. I think he obtained it just to see what it was all about. More can be found in &quot;Episode 53 - Certified Hackers&quot; in which he goes into a nice rant... the Story begins at (50.35) and you can dowload it from the bottom of this page (http://www.binrev.com/radio/archive.php?p=7). The saga continues in this episode: &quot;Episode 67 - Hacking class&quot; which can be found by scrolling down to around the middle of this page (http://www.binrev.com/radio/archive.php?p=6).<br /><br />I think he also mentions it here [searching... ... ...]<br />Others have also mentioned it on their own radio shows [More to come...]<br /><br /><br />There is alot on this topic to digest (not to mention the whole concept itself &nbsp;of the possibility of getting a license in ethical anything) and it is for this reason that I'm posting the pertinent links before this Monday so people can get an idea of the breadth of this subject. Pay special attention to the &quot;Course Outline&quot; on the businesses' website: http://www.eccouncil.org/CEH.htm as I found the outline itself very informative. I also noticed something a little strange with the typeset... Also, look at the long list of prominent customers... kind of reminds me of Trusted Computing Group (TCG) a.k.a </span><span style="font-size: 18px;" class="bbc_size">Palladium</span> (http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/tcpa-faq.html) <br /><br /><span style="font-size: 12px;" class="bbc_size">&quot;School teaches 'ethical hacking'&quot; (http://news.com.com/School%2Bteaches%2B%27ethical%2Bhacking%27/2100-7355_3-5252764.html?tag=sas.email) (Reuters)<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Enjoy your turkey then prepare yourself for Perpetual Night.<br /><br />http://patriotwatch.org/</span>
