				http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21134540/vp/23465732#23465732<br /><br />this link is a msnbc news story about a marine in iraq who was videotaped throwing a live puppy off of a cliff.<br /><br />this is appalling.<br /><br />with all of these recent stories of soldiers saving dogs that they&#039;ve found, you get this one <em>animal</em> who finds it amusing to do something like this.&nbsp; you actually see him laughing at the end of the video.&nbsp; according to the news report, the marines have suspended this guy pending an investigation, but i hope that there is some justice in the case once all is said and done.&nbsp; animal cruelty in a felony in a lot of places, and i hope this crime is treated as such.&nbsp; i don&#039;t care if this guy is a soldier.&nbsp; i hope he spends some time in jail paying for this.

				I read it early this morning on CNN. Apparently this was a video on YouTube and YT took it down<br />immediately when they got complaints about it. Supposedly the marine was with at least one other<br />marine and they referred to each other by name, making it easy to ID them. An officer was quoted<br />as saying that it would be investigated.<br /><br />And he&#039;s not an animal&nbsp; --- he&#039;s a savage. Animals aren&#039;t that cruel to their young.

				just a gut feeling. wouldn&#039;t be the first internet/YouTube hoax out there. the puppy is out of frame right before he throws it. the &quot;thud&quot; is a little too audible for a handheld camcorder. etc...

				Even assuming it were a hoax, it was a stupid, moronic and barbaric thing to do.&nbsp; That you could do something like that, even in jest, is just plain cruel and not the slightest bit funny to me.

				Is anyone other than me appalled at the fact that this is even a &quot;news story&quot;? Why does stuff like this make national news? The guy deserves punishment if he abused an animal, but I see no reason why this deserves media coverage. I used to have cnn.com as my home page because I like knowing what&#039;s going on in the world before I move on to do less educational things on the internet, but so much of the news on there is sensationalized, disgusting, and yet trivial crap that has no bearing on anyone. I ended up changing it to the generally more news-like (or at least easier to sift through) news.google.com. <br /><br />Today, cnn.com brings us important world stories such as &quot;Wendy&#039;s 911 tapes: &#039;He blew my arm off&#039;&quot; and &quot;Good Samaritan killed over $5.&quot; These are listed as top stories on the main page. Appalling news stories, indeed.<br /><br />But I digress.
