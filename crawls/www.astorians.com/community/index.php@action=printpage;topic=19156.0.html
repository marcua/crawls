				Hello there! <br />I haven&#039;t posted since I initially moved to Astoria, but three years later I&#039;m still here and looking to stay for a while longer. I recently started working from home, but with two of us sharing a small apartment we are curious to know whether there are any active co-working spaces in Astoria? I saw a couple of threads on the topic, but no definite solutions other than Surf Caf√© (which sounds great and I&#039;m going to check it out soon).<br /><br />Thanks you for any leads,<br /><br />Zhenya

				When I last checked, Surf Astoria was closed.&nbsp; If it&#039;s open again, please let me know.&nbsp; &nbsp;The FB and web site have not been updated in months.&nbsp; I would love to find one too, as I freelance from home and it can get lonely.&nbsp; The only option I know of is Panera on 36th Ave and that&#039;s a far walk. The Starbucks down on Ditmars is way small and too busy.&nbsp; The library has crappy hours.&nbsp; I&#039;m looking at options in Manhattan.

				That&#039;s too bad... I&#039;m sure there are many freelancers in Astoria. Last year I was visiting back home and used a co-working office for a couple of weeks. It was a great experience, but one year later it has closed.&nbsp; :| What kind of work do you do? I&#039;m a translator and my bf is a programmer. Fairly quiet as far as chit chat and phone use goes but it&#039;s nice to have a dedicated work space with coworkers without the office politics.<br />

				I&#039;ve been working in animation for over ten years, and have been designing web sites for independent artists and small business clients for the past three years.&nbsp; Animation is largely by definition a freelance business and I started working from home in 07/08 when the economy slowed down.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t do it intentionally but as the years rolled by, I&#039;ve become to really enjoy working from home and being my own boss.&nbsp; I love working with my clients and making my own schedule.&nbsp; But it would be really nice to be in a collaborative and stimulating environment with other creatives and I wish Astoria had some place for us to go.&nbsp;
