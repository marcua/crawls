				Coming home today I was in dire need of a chocolate fix... where to go while walking down Broadway????<br /><br />it occured to me that i&#039;d seen chocolate by the register at Bakeway - figured - they&#039;re a bake shop (mostly) and so they must have some good chocolate.&nbsp; <br /><br />.... there it was .... lined up by the register.... in it&#039;s recycled paper wrapper.... 3 oz give or take a couple of tenths.... organic....dark..... chili pepper with ginger.... stopped me from even checking the other flavors... handed it to the cashier and she says.....<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />$7.50.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />WHAT!!!!!!!????????<br /><br /><br />who in the hell would pay $7.50 for a bar of chocolate in Astoria?????&nbsp; 7.50.&nbsp; <br /><br />I told her that surely she was mistaken.&nbsp; Just one bar.&nbsp; Then I asked - do you sell any of these??? The manager looking fellow behind the counter scowled at me.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t mean to insult.&nbsp; I even saw the price tag - yet assumed it was for a different item.&nbsp; <br /><br />so i gave back the chocolate bar and continued down the street to .... associated?&nbsp; trade fair???&nbsp; I don&#039;t know ... I mix up my supermarkets.... got my Green &amp; Blacks Organic Dark chocolate (spicy orange) ... it was $2.99.&nbsp; It was just okay.&nbsp; I wonder if the $7.50 bar is 2.5 times better.&nbsp; <br />

				We have all the requisite spices at home. For $7.50, you could obtain high-quality ginger and chili powder, buy some good chocolate, melt it down and make your own.<br /><br />

				Even though Bakeway has some yummy goodies, I agree that it&#039;s a bit on the pricey end.. I&#039;d rather spend my money at Parisi Bro and get their yummy rainbow cookies!

				What brand costs $7.50?<br /><br />Green &amp; Blacks is a very good brand. The Dark chocolate with Spicy Orange is just okay. Better to try their Cherry, Hazelnut Current, or Dark 70%, they are excellent.

				That is quite expensive for Astoria...those are city prices....and for well known designer chocolate bars (e.g. Vosges, Jacques Torres).&nbsp; Did they have at least samples so that you can try it out?&nbsp; I would probably buy it if it tastes amazing...When I get a chocolate fix, I usually just buy go for a chocolate truffle with a chocolate filling.&nbsp; It&#039;s like getting a chocolate adrenilin shot &lt;g&gt;.
