				&quot;But the state has failed on employment, leaving students with skills and aspirations twisting in the wind.&quot;<br /><br />Thus leaving them only one option. &nbsp;To riot.<br /><br />(/sarcasm)<br /><br />I am not a fan of victim mentality.

				While I don't agree that riots are &quot;the answer&quot; -- I'm not sure I agree that they are the embodiment of the victim mentality either. &nbsp;<br /><br />If something is so deeply broken within the system, won't the problem continue to worsen until it reaches a critical breaking point?<br /><br />That the rioting is so wide spread in France suggests that it's more than just a small group of angsty youth. <br /><br />I think it's a step in the right direction not to say &quot;this is wrong&quot; but &quot;this is wrong, why is it happening?&quot;. &nbsp;<br /><br />France is also a country with quite a history of civil unrest. &nbsp;It's not quick to change -- but when change does come about, it's sometimes driven by social uprising.<br /><br />Anyhow, I've been in Paris somewhat recently so it's a little fresh in my mind. &nbsp;<br /><br />-j
