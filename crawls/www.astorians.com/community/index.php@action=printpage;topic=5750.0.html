				This was in the business section of the NY Times:<br /><br />http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/29/business/29tax.html?_r=1&amp;ref=business&amp;oref=slogin<br /><br />Of particular note is the following:<br /><br /><strong>Others argued that public policies had played a role in the shift. Robert Greenstein, executive director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, an advocacy group for the poor, said that the data understates the widening disparity between the top 1 percent and the rest of the country.<br /><br />He said that in addition to rising incomes and reduced taxes, the equation should take into account cuts in fringe benefits to workers and in government services that middle-class and poor Americans rely on more than the affluent. These include health care, child care and education spending.</strong><br /><br /><br /><br />

				<br />** there are all sorts of stats and I found the article below to be bizarrely hilarious.<br />I wonder how much confidence there is for Americans at this time. Seems there are very few sincere economists in leadership positions, and even then there are political divides **<br /><br /><br />TAX &amp; SPEND: WHO WINS <br />By SCOTT HODGE <br />nypost.com<br /><br /><br />March 29, 2007 -- FROM property taxes to income taxes, the tax burden for the average American household continues to rise. This year, Americans will have to work a full four months before they will pay off all the taxes they owe. <br />But while the tax burden increases, so, too, does the amount government spends. Where does all that money go? <strong>Are Americans getting a good deal? </strong> <br /><br />Countless studies have looked at who pays the most taxes, but very few have examined who ends up getting all the money that federal, state, and local governments hand out. Now, with the most recent data available, we can determine where it goes, who gets it and the value of what they receive for their tax dollar. <br /><br />In 2004, the total tax burden paid by Americans reached $3 trillion - roughly $27,000 per household. For that, the average U.S. household received more than $31,000 in government services. That includes direct payments from Social Security, Medicare and other programs as well as public goods distributed uniformly, such as defense spending. <br />&nbsp;:?<br /><br />But that only tells part of the story. <br /><br />In a recent report, the Tax Foundation separated American households evenly into five income groups, or &quot;quintiles,&quot; and evaluated taxes and spending at all government levels to see which Americans pay the most in taxes and which ones receive the most in spending. <br /><br />In 2004, the quintile of households with the lowest income received roughly $8.21 in total government spending for each dollar of taxes paid. Middle-income households got $1.30 per tax dollar, while the highest-earning took in just 41 cents. <br /><br />The ratio of taxes paid to services received is most stark at the federal level. Those in the lowest quintile received $14.76 in federal spending for every dollar they paid in federal taxes; for middle earners, it was $1.29; top earners, just 32 cents. <br /><br />In total-dollar terms, low-income families netted over $31,000 each from government taxes and spending, while high-income households lost roughly $48,000. <br /><br />This analysis shows a massive downward redistribution of over $1 trillion from the top two quintiles to the bottom three. Fully 60 percent of all Americans are net consumers of government services. That is, they receive more from government spending than they pay in taxes. <br /><br />Most Americans are completely unaware of these facts. In a recent Harris Interactive survey, nine out of 10 respondents said they believed the cost of the government services they received totaled less than $10,000 - just a third of what is actually spent on the average household. <br /><br />This suggests Americans either have a low opinion of the government services they receive or simply lack any idea about how much those services cost. <br /><br />And costs are only going to increase. <br /><br /><strong>The onset of retiring baby boomers will drive entitlement spending into the stratosphere - and the imbalance between those who pay and those who consume will make solving these problems extremely difficult. Explosions in spending will have to be paid by a smaller and smaller group of taxpayers. </strong> <br /><br />Needless to say, this is unsustainable. <br /><br />Unfortunately, these facts escape most lawmakers as they perforate the tax code with special carve-outs for politically favorable groups and pontificate about income inequality in America - all the while ignoring the vast disparities in government spending. <br /><br />Yes, many believe that tax and spending policies should be vehicles for mitigating income differences - but the facts about how today&#039;s policies massively redistribute from high to low earners should be a vital part of the debate. <br /><br />Scott Hodge is the president of the Tax Foundation.<br /><br />** Might be a long winded description of &#039;progressive&#039; taxation&nbsp; :|&nbsp; **<br /><br />

				Oh yeah, does anyone listen to the Only in New York podcast? Sam Roberts, a NYT metro reporter, does featurettes on things that, you guessed it, can only happen in NY. It&#039;s usually interesting and the episode from March 29th that talks about how the rich are taking over Manhattan. Basically, the population is increasing and the numbers of poor people are declining. Big surprise, I know. What, with the largest development boom in the city&#039;s history...<br /><br />Here&#039;s an excerpt:<br /><br />&quot;Since 2000, the number of children under age five living in Manhattan mushroomed by more than 32%. <br />[...]<br />For the first time since at least the 1960s, white children out-number either black or hispanic youngsters in that age group in Manhattan. They&#039;re being raised by parents whose median income was an astounding $284,000 a year in 2005. That means they&#039;re growing up in wealthier households than similar youngsters in any other large county in the country.&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;m just glad to find out that my median income still has a ways to go before it reaches &quot;astounding.&quot;

				About 30 plus years ago, the salary of a CEO was 20 times more than the basic starting salary of a company. Today a CEO makes 400 times more than the basic strating salary of a company. The average American family of four needs 2 salaries to make ends meet, and still has trouble saving money for college tuition and retirement. The average senior citizen could live on their monthly social security checks, today alot of them need food stamps and still go through trash for cans to recycling money to help pay for groceries, or have to choose between food and medicine. The middle class has been in the process of being eliminated since Reagan started his presidency in 1981, its a national discrace that we&#039;ve allowed lobbyists to deregulate corporations and change laws that make the rich richer, and push the middle class into poverty.

If a CEO makes 10x what you make or 50x what you make, it has no bearing on your life experience, your level of wealth, your ability to earn money. There is not a fixed amount of wealth in a society that&#039;s held by the few at the expense of the many. Wealth is created every time you engage in a transaction where you value what you get more than what you spend.&nbsp; <br /><br />A CEO isn&#039;t earning what he&#039;s earning at your expense. There is a market for CEOs. That market drives up the salaries of the best CEOs because of the value they can create for the businesses that hire them. There is a market for every person&#039;s labor, and their compensation is based on the value they bring to their jobs. Also, if a million people can do what you do, your labor will not be valued as highly as it would if only 10,000 people can do what you do. So on, so forth.<br /><br />2. Relatively unregulated markets have made life more affordable, healthier, longer, and in many ways RICHER for the vast majority of people all around the world. Compare the life experience of people with a real income of $35,000.00 in 1900 NYC to the same people today: vaccines, cell phones, televisions, computers, a wider range of educational and career opportunities. Your 1900 self would look at your 2007 self in absolute awe of your wealth.<br /><br />3. As a small businessman trying to grow, my greatest obstacle is the tax and regulatory system. It is brutal. It makes the difference between my being able to hire people and having to let somebody go or do a job on my own. The excessive red tape that many small businesses face is demoralizing and ultimately impoverishing. Want to press for reforms, don&#039;t attack the rich, attack the source of business expenses for which there is no return.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />4. But if you do decide to &quot;eat the rich&quot;, keep this in mind: they&#039;ll just take their money, investments, expertise elsewhere, to a different state or country where they aren&#039;t penalized. And in many cases they&#039;ll take economic opportunities with them. Jobs will be created... elsewhere. New businesses started... elsewhere. <br />Rich people play a key role in any society. They can afford to test out new technologies and advancements before anyone else, and their ability to do this enables entrepreneurs to create products that have extraordinarily high manufacturing costs and offer them at stratospheric price points. Eventually some of these products are successful enough for long enough that manufacturing problems can be solved and they can be offered to the rest of society far more affordably.<br /><br />***<br /><br />The national disgrace is what happened to me and whole helluvalotta other people on April 15th. We&#039;re supposed to be the freest country on the planet, but this tax code is vicious.

				The statement that a CEO doesn&#039;t earn what he does at our expense is not exactly true. It drives up the cost of the bottom line of the company, and effects what funds are then avalailable to how many lower salary employees are on the payroll, but what their annual increase may be. Frequently employees making under $30,000, the annual raise doesn&#039;t even match the cost of living increase. Every hear of an high level executive getting an increase that doesn&#039;t at least match the cost of living percentage? The fact that the income gap between CEO and average salary employee has gone from 20 times to 400 or 500 times, is greed to the extreme. How can anybody justify an executive being worth 500 times the salary of another employee?<br /><br />The median salary has in no way kept up with the cost of living. A family of four was able to support itself with a single bread winner&#039;s full time salary. Today most families need 2 full time jobs to make ends meet, and they still have it tough. We need to narrow the income gap, not defend it.

So they killed enough chickens until their output was &#039;even&#039;.) We want to expand wealth for all, and be careful not to penalize wealth creation.<br /><br /><br /><br />A big question is how do you narrow the income &#039;gap&#039;. And why are salaries stagnating.<br /><br />A high executive salary could be justified by market forces, or that there are market reasons for the chasms between pay.<br />But I worry that the market is not in fact working and that the responsibility of setting appropriate compensation is being neglected or corrupted.<br /><br />There are some things that companies and society can do. Like promoting skill development. And better labor negotiations. And maybe even awareness/ disclosure could help in the end. (Are we customers of such businesses that have such high paid executives and low employee wages?)<br />There are also important issues related to education, but that is another big topic.<br /><br /><br />What is Fair Trade?<br /><br /><br />I believe we get our society as a consequence of our values. <br />To me, profit is very different from greed. <br />(from Latin meaning &quot;to make progress&quot;)<br /><br />If greed is the <span class="bbc_u">only </span> value, then I worry that capitalism would not produce as much benefit as we could.<br /><br />

				30 grand is abysmal here in NYC. Take half of that after taxes and rent, never mind other fixed expenses. If it costs you $50/week to fill your gas tank for commuting, that&#039;s substantial. <br /><br />Cost of health insurance out of a paycheck like that is also a hefty chunk o&#039; change. I went without it for years (on and off) just because I&#039;m relatively young and healthy and it was cheaper to pay full price for a checkup every couple of years than to pay monthly. Risky, I know.<br /><br />My 1900 self would&#039;ve looked at the prices of everything- $4.00 for a box of cereal, $20,000 for a car, $750,000 for a house- and been like, holy #&amp;*%!!
