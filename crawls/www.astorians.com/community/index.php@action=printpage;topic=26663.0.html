				It looks to me from a search that any dentist recommendation made on Astorians.com are several to many years old. Does anyone see a dentist that they like and would recommend? Have experience with other resources for finding a good dentist?<br /><br /><br />Much thanks!

				My dentist is Dr. Michael Love on 33rd Street, between Broadway &amp; 34th Ave. (closer to Broadway, just around the corner from Omonia Cafe)<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve been with Dr. Love for about 15 years. He does excellent work - I&#039;ve had two crowns done by him as well as just<br />routine cleanings/maintenance during that time. He&#039;s also super nice and will work with you in cases where you don&#039;t have dental coverage or are on a tight budget. He does also accept many insurance plans. <br /><br /><br />He has the practice with his brother, who I&#039;ve also seen a few times when I&#039;ve had to switch appointments to a time when my dentist isn&#039;t in. His brother is just as good. <br /><br /><br />Office staff is also very nice. They have good hours - days, evenings and Saturdays which is very convenient.<br /><br />

				ladydi, thank you for posting your recommendation of Dr. Love. He was among those recommended in the threads from several years back. Long-time satisfied patients!<br /><br /><br />I am interested in other recommendations though, too, if anyone has any to post. <br /><br /><br />Much appreciated!

				My husband, my sister, and her husband all go to the Dr.&#039;s Love - as do I.<br /><br /><br />I like them - I see Michael, my sister sees Howard.&nbsp; Both seem competent and personable.

				Unfortunately I don&#039;t have a Ditmars recommendation for you, but if that&#039;s not a dealbreaker then I highly recommend Dr. Takos. He is fantastic and so is his staff. I&#039;ve referred several friends to him and they have all had excellent experiences there.

				Whether you opt for Dr. Love or Dr. Takos, nothing in Astoria is that far away. If you&#039;re at Ditmars, Dr. Love&#039;s office is<br />a 5-minute ride away on the train. <br /><br /><br />Honestly, if i required every doctor and business I patronize to be in my area of Astoria (30th Avenue) I&#039;d be <br />severely limited. My gym is at 35th Ave. &amp; 37th St., dentist is at Broadway, all my other doctors are in Manhattan.<br />That&#039;s the great thing about Astoria - the location makes it easy to get to/from anywhere.<br /><br /><br /><br />
