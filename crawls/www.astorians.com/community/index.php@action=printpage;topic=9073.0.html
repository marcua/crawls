				SO, theres lots and lots of discussion on restaurants in Astoria, but what is your absolute favorite place to eat in the hood? Just in general, I&#039;m curious, not writing a book. <br />Personally, I like Bel Aire Diner for late-night grease, and Euro Delights on 32nd &amp; Bway for something sweet. My all-time fave, is the chicken ceaser salad (with feta cheese) at Kolonaki. Though I must admit I&#039;m not a big fan of the new price for it, it&#039;s still an addiction to me.

				My top 3, based on where I live (31st Ave). <br />I have so many great places to eat near me that sometimes it&#039;s overwhelming, but these are the places I eat from most frequently.<br /><br />For a $4 pita sandwich: the Souvlaki cart on 32nd and Broadway<br />Mexican: El Tulcingo Deli IV on Broadway between 29th St. and Crescent<br />Greek (near 30th Ave): Opa!

				Wave Thai is hands down my favorite place to eat in Astoria. As discussed elsewhere on this board, I was really disappointed with Thai Elephant&#039;s curry, which is my staple thai order. I&#039;ve heard the noodles are better at Thair Elephant, so I guess it depends on what kind of thai food you like. Wave Thai, though, has better curry than several of the &quot;best&quot; places (or so my friends say) down in the village.

				One of my favs is Agnanti - the Greek restaurant on Ditmars down by the park.&nbsp; They have a great menu with lots of options that you may not see at other places.&nbsp; Very well priced and everything is delicious.&nbsp; The only downside is that you may have a to wait for a bit on a Sat night, but I think that shows that they have a lot of true fans, since it&#039;s an out of the way location. <br /><br />And I see that there are Wave and Elephant fans out there - I&#039;m on the Wave!

				I have to agree with the nods to JJ&#039;s. Ali at Kebab Cafe deserves a shout out too, while I&#039;ve only been there once, it was the best meal I&#039;d had in quite a long time. <br />Since we were just recently introduced to Il Bambino it&#039;s on the short list, but I&#039;m sure that we&#039;ll be ordering from there more frequently.

				There are just so many good restaurants in Astoria to choose from!&nbsp; Some of our regular places are Fatty&#039;s, JJ&#039;s, and Locale, but my hands down favorite has to be Stove.&nbsp; It&#039;s the type of place where you can get dressed up and have a cozy &quot;date night&quot;, or you can show up in jeans and enjoy a pint of Guinness and their very tasty fish and chips.&nbsp; <br /><br />Bonus: they have a great brunch, too!&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				<strong>1. Il Bambino.</strong> Darren really pays attention to every detail, be it a panini or a soup.<br /><strong>2. Agnanti.</strong> The fish and seafood are always light and fresh, and the cheeses (saganaki!) are delicious.<br /><strong>3. Michael Angelo&#039;s II (or Michael &amp; Angelo&#039;s).</strong> I&#039;m surprised no one talks about this place. Incredible thin-crust pizza prepared however you&#039;d like, several delicious entrees with massive portions, and, in my opinion, the best cannoli in Astoria.

				Some of the best pizza around, yes, but unfortunately some of the rudest people I&#039;ve ever met.&nbsp; After ordering delivery countless times we went to the place to eat.&nbsp; We were charged higher prices for the food than we pay for delivery because of &quot;the silverware, china, and waitress.&quot;<br /><br />We do order the pizza to be delivered now and again, but I would never go back.<br />[/quote]<br /><br />I really surprised you&#039;ve felt they were rude there. The first time I went there, there was only one other table filled, so it made sense that they were kind and attentive to us. However, the next time I went, they really went out of their way to be great to us. My boyfriend and I were waiting to meet some friends and they only had the six-seater table in the back open. Since there were going to be only 4 of us, we told them we were willing to wait so they could keep it open for larger parties. However, after a little bit, they had us sit down there anyway rather than wait for better business. Also, the four of us were having so much trouble deciding on an appetizer, that the chef actually offered to make us a special appetizer, which was delicious (even though we still ended up ordering 3!). Then at the end of our meal, our waiter brought us shots of sambuca for free. The whole time the chefs were quite friendly as was the waiter - I love that he is always singing, which I know is odd, but I like knowing he&#039;s having a good day. Maybe you caught them on a bad day. I haven&#039;t tried delivery yet, but we were charged the same price for the pizza eating in as is on their take-out menu. <br /><br />My places:<br />Il Bambino<br />Agnanti<br />Michael Angelo&#039;s II<br />Fatty&#039;s<br />JJ&#039;s<br /><br /><br />Looking forward to trying Mojave, though! Plus, I&#039;ve not yet eaten at Local, Bistro 33, 718, Wave Thai, or many of the other restaurants being listed on here. I&#039;m going to have to get on that!

				To the people recommending places for burgers (Sunswick, Dillengers, etc.), do they cook the burgers to order? That is, will they allow me to order a rare burger? If so, will it actually come rare? I enjoy Sparrow&#039;s burgers, but while they allow you to order rare burgers, I&#039;ve never seen a burger that was actually rare come out of that kitchen. So, it would be great to find a place that makes an awesome burger and actually cooks it to order!

				The Blue Dinner is on 30th Ave between Steinway and 41st.&nbsp; Looks like a hole in the wall dinner, and it used to be, but it was purchased by a Mexican owner about two years ago and he/she kept the dinner menu for the old regulars but will pull out a kick-ass authentic Mexican menu only if you ask for it.&nbsp; Their tacos are awesome, and the staff is nice.&nbsp; Best Mexican in Astoria.&nbsp; Two to three dollars per taco too!

				Just Arthur&#039;s serves Italian food in their dining room. It was pretty good the time I tried it, and the service was friendly. My only complaints were that the interior was on the chilly side, and the prices were a little bit high! Still, I&#039;d recommend it.<br /><br />Everyone else eating there seemed to be senior citizens, so it&#039;s possible the place has a built-in clientele and doesn&#039;t need to attract new customers to do business.

				I have a new favorite Mexican place!&nbsp; I&#039;m very excited to add Guacamole Restaurant as my BEST MEXICAN Restaurant in Astoria.&nbsp; I had dinner there last night and the Carne Asada blew me away.&nbsp; The place is relatively new, I believe only 6 months old.&nbsp; It is located on Broadway between 38th and Steinway.&nbsp; The staff was very friendly.&nbsp; The guacamole was great.<br /><br />This place is very authentic Mexican.&nbsp; The dinning is casual, the interior is nothing fancy, but the food is better than the setting would suggest.&nbsp; They take care to make a nice presentation on the plate, they do not just slop the food on it.<br /><br />My friends&#039; only complaint was that the music was out of place, and I think this might be a big reason why the place was empty on a Saturday night even though the food was great.&nbsp; They have to decide what crowd they are catering to.&nbsp; Also, there was a flat screen TV in the middle of the wall, yet the place does not have a bar, so it seemed unnecessary.<br /><br />Overall, you must check this place out if you like Mexican food.

				I&#039;m feeling lazy and didn&#039;t want to go back and read all 8 pages, but I&#039;m partial to Porta Bella on 45st and Ditmars. I love their rigatoni fiorentina.&nbsp; Their service is good, but a few times I tried to call in to pick up the food and they messed up each times. So now, I have them deliver, and there&#039;s never a problem.&nbsp; It&#039; s just a bit embarrassing since I live right around the corner.&nbsp;

				Valverde. Up until last week, I lived across the street, but even after moving I&#039;ll still try and go once a week. They added crispy bacon to the brunch menu. Oh boy. Crispy crumbly bacon heaped on a plate with the already yummy eggs? Heaven on a plate. <br /><br />And after one chicken platter I&#039;m also in love with King of Falafel on Broadway and 30th. They had me at the hot sauce. <br /><br /><br />

				So I am adding Mundo to my list. I finally got off my butt and tried it. It was awesome! I am so excited to have a inexpensive and tasty new place in the Broadway area to eat at.&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />Slightly OT- Has anyone gotten delivery from Mundo? What was your experience? Sometimes eating at the restaurant vs. ordering out can be a totally differant experience.

Great tapas. One of my all-time favorite places. <br /><br />The quality is always top-notch because they won&#039;t serve food if it&#039;s not up to par. One time I ordered the squid in garlic sauce (love it so much, I order it just about every time-- perfectly tender calamari with sauce that begs to have every last drop sopped up with bread), and he told me that they weren&#039;t completely happy with the shipment of calamari they received, so they weren&#039;t going to serve it. Which I totally appreciated-- I&#039;d rather not get my favorite dish than eat a mediocre version.
