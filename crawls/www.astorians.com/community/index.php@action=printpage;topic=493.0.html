				I don't usually share the jokes people send me but I made an exception with this one because I thought it was funny.<br /><br /><br />A monkey is sitting in a tree smoking a joint when a lizard walks past and looks up and says to the monkey &quot;Hey! what are you doing?&quot; The monkey says &quot;Smoking a joint, come on up and have some.&quot;So the lizard climbs up and sits next to the monkey and they have a few joints. After a while the lizard says his mouth is 'dry' and is going to get a drink from the river. <br /><br />The lizard is so stoned that he leans too far over and falls into the river.<br />A Crocodile sees this and swims over to the lizard and helps him to the side,then asks the lizard, &quot;What's the matter with you?&quot; The lizard explains to the crocodile that he was sitting smoking a joint with the monkey in the tree, got too stoned and then fell into the river while taking a drink.<br /><br />The crocodile says he has to check out this pot smoking monkey, so he walks into the jungle, finds the tree were the monkey is sitting, finishing a joint, and he looks up and says &quot;Hey you, monkey!&quot;<br /><br />The Monkey looks down and says &quot;SHITTTTTTTT dude....... how much water did you drink?!!&quot; &nbsp;:lol:
