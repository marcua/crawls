				I&#039;ve done couch to 5K (http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml) before and liked it - now I&#039;d be starting at the beginning again. <br /><br />Are there other people in the broadway area who&#039;d be interested in a running group? Just one running buddy would be great, a whole group would be fabulous. Evening runs around 7.00 would be pretty good for me. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				I can also be flexible about timing. Come on, there has to be ONE astorian who&#039;d like to do some beginner-level jogging with me 2 or 3 times a week!

				Way too cold for me to even think about running.&nbsp; I usually start around mid-late April, when the weather gets at least to a consistent 50 degrees.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m sure many others are the same way.

				enigmacat, I&#039;m a not-terribly-fast-but-fairly-experienced runner, and I would love to run with you!&nbsp; My weeknights are a little out of the question, until the end of May (grad school), but weekends are golden.&nbsp; Let&#039;s talk! :)

				Okay, I think I can be persuaded to give it a try.&nbsp; However, I may not advance much.&nbsp; I love walking and speed-walking but I&#039;m not one much for jogging.&nbsp; I&#039;ll do it on a treadmill because there&#039;s some shock absorption there, but the unforgiving concrete&#039;s another thing.&nbsp; But hey, maybe starting off really slowly may help.&nbsp; Anyway, for me, I guess mornings and weekends are best because, as you know enigma, I never know how late I&#039;ll be working.

				another convert! :D<br /><br />I&#039;m not against trying morning running though i do think i run better later in the day. i know what you mean about the hard concrete ... but i strategically saved $$ by not renewing my gym membership this year. i think the slow start helps, too.<br /><br />And any time you just want to go for a walk give me a ring. I LOVE walking.

				I&#039;m once more looking for a walking/running buddy, or a group of walking/running buddies, to walk/run in the evenings in the Broadway/ 30th ave/ 34th Ave vicinity. <br /><br />I&#039;m an experienced walker. <br />I&#039;m a bad runner. <br />Join me!

				wow, ever done a search for couch, thats a popular one.<br />Most recently been less 5k and more couch.<br /><br /><br />NY has the Parks Run coming up in CP<br />April 18 <br /><br />http://www.nyrr.org/races/2010/calendar/april.asp<br /><br />Have other walking for now, but would be up for the Astoria track later Sunday.

Sattelmair, M.Sc., lead author and doctoral candidate in epidemiology at Harvard School of Public Health in Boston, Mass. <br />“Physical activity is essential to promoting cardiovascular health and reducing risk of cardiovascular disease, and walking is one way of achieving physical activity.” <br /><br />More physically active people generally have a lower risk of stroke than the least active, with more-active persons having a 25 percent to 30 percent lower risk for all strokes, according to previous studies.<br /><br />“Though the exact relationship among different types of physical activity and different stroke <br />subtypes remains unclear, the results of this specific study indicate that walking, in particular, is associated with lower risk of stroke,” Sattelmair said.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
