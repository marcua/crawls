				When the shutters are down and the restaurant is closed (after-hours) it looks like it often looks like it went out of business. I walked by yesterday but didn&#039;t notice it out of business. I like it there, I hope it didn&#039;t close down for good.

				We have tried a few times over the past 3 weeks to call for delivery, sadly no answer... Freshest and most authentic Thai this side of Sunnyside; It seemed to be doing well too - the last time we ate there the usual younger staff were not working, an older lady and no heat; Safe to say its closed.

				In the meantime, try Thai Angel (I think 30th Ave and 35th St), I live near Thai Chili and have ordered from there a lot.&nbsp; I will try to pass by it tonight and see if it is closed closed.

				Thai Chili looks very closed, I pass by it every morning/evening to and from work and there&#039;s no sign, but it&#039;s been like that for over a month now. It&#039;s too bad, but I hope something good moves in there and to San Souci next door to it.

				there&#039;s a new Thai place on Bway between 34th and 35th - I tried it today and it was pretty decent. <br /><br />more expensive than Yajai Thai, where I generally prefer to order from.

				OPEN AGAIN! I just stopped by and they&#039;re back with their restaurant and delivery. Apparently, they were renovating their downstairs kitchen and opening up a new place in Jersey...a sign would have been nice, but at least they&#039;re still here. YEAH! :mrgreen:
