				OK, so I was at the Bouchon Bakery in Columbus Circle today trying to enjoy a splurge lunch which was interrupted by the woman standing next to me who was complaining loudly and bitterly into her cell phone about printing out pictures from IPhoto.&nbsp; I was having a hard time imagining having to listen to all of this throughout my entire lunch, so I asked her politely &quot;Excuse me, could you please keep your voice down a little bit?&quot;&nbsp; She gave me an angry glare, continued talking into her cell phone, and then started complaining (loudly enough that I could hear) that I had asked her to keep her voice down, that I should get the message that there are a lot of people in New York, how could I dare ask her to keep her voice down, etc. etc. for about five minutes.&nbsp; Finally I said &quot;Just let it go, OK?&quot; and she accused me of eavesdropping on her, started shrieking that I was a psycho (the f-word was used during this time) and that I should read a book instead of listening in on her private conversation with a friend.&nbsp; I pointed out that first of all, this was not a private space and that secondly, the only reason I could overhear was because she was talking so loudly.&nbsp; She was already done eating so she packed up and wheeled herself and her baby stroller away, still complaining into her phone.<br /><br />Was I in the wrong?&nbsp; I guess I don&#39;t understand the logic of pretending that public spaces are private phone booths.&nbsp; I work in a store one day a week, and I&#39;ve had customers who are on their cell phones the entire time, even up to the cash register, to the point where I feel bad for interrupting their conversation to say &quot;Can you sign for the charge?&quot;

				I&#39;m not sure, frankly. I mean, look at email. When you first got it you forwarded every damn joke/political statement you got to everyone in your mailbox. Eventually the idea developed that this created problems and/or discomfort for others (which I think is the basic definition of rudeness) and at this point only a few people do that. (Still far too many, but a relative few).<br /><br />I could be wrong, but it seems to me that since public cell phone doesn&#39;t have a few hundred years of ettiquette manuals behind it it&#39;s easier for people to justify doing it. I&#39;m not pretending they&#39;re not rude to do so, but I think some people need to learn something at their mother&#39;s knee or it just never sinks in. I have friends who are very polite people normally but use their cells in ways I think are rather rude. There&#39;s just no historical framework for &quot;appropriate use&quot;.<br /><br />Just my opinion :) And the most basic tenent of good manners is concern for the comfort of those around you, and even if someone didn&#39;t get the memo about not screaming into their cell they should tone it down when asked.

				I was just thinking of rudeness in general.&nbsp; For example: I was on a transatlantic flight and before tucking into our fabulous meals, I politely asked the woman in front of me if she wouldn&#39;t mind putting her chair upright (and asking her husband and daughter to do the same).&nbsp; This I thought was common decency.&nbsp; She looked at me as if I had just put a gun to her child&#39;s head, and then vehemently refused to do so.&nbsp; People are assholes.&nbsp;

				Yeah, why don&#39;t people realize you can talk in a low/normal voice and still be heard by the person you are speaking with? Max is so bad about doing this and I always have to tell him not to talk so loud. The retail store I worked in near Gramercy Park had a strict &quot;no cell&quot; policy and the boss would actually take someone&#39;s elbow and escort them out if they didn&#39;t want to get off when asked. I loved it!! Esp. when it was some 20-year-old trustfund babe who had never been told &quot;no&quot; in her life! LMAO!<br /><br />Since I don&#39;t mind calling attention to myself, and I think all of us here know I can argue till the cows come home, I probably would have started talking just as loud about her till <em>she</em> was embarrassed! mcw I know you are too nice for that though! Maybe saying something to the owner/manager and pointing out how this ONE person is disturbing all the other customers.<br /><br />

(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wa_(Japanese)) Google is your friend.<br /><br />I think it&#39;s unreasonable to expect not to hear people at all when talking on the phone. When you talk with your hand cupped over the phone at a normal volume, it&#39;s not that different from talking with a friend who&#39;s sitting right in front of you.

A lot of people simply don&#39;t give a crap about polluting, whether it&#39;s noise or material. A bit of that and, whether they realize it or not, some people like making themselves known.. establishing their territory, if you will. They don&#39;t care if they&#39;re infringing on other people&#39;s in the process, and they get quite offended if you call them on it. <br /><br />I&#39;m a pretty easy-going, open-minded person, as long as people do what they do with respect to others. I don&#39;t mind people smoking as long as I don&#39;t have to smell it. I don&#39;t mind the guys upstairs listening to music as long as it doesn&#39;t wake me up in the middle of the night. And I don&#39;t mind people talking on their cell phones as long as it&#39;s not at the top of their lungs in a public place. I wish more people thought about the way their actions affected others and actually bothered to act like they cared.

				When I first got a cell phone, I was always very conscious about my phone-behavior. I wouldn&#39;t use a phone in any small space or where people could easily overhear. Now, I hardly think about who&#39;s listening to my conversations - I probably qualify as borderline-rude. I guess my phone etiquette has changed as cell phones became a way of life... something to think about. <br /><br />The one thing that does bother me about using cell phones in public spaces is having to overhear people&#39;s very personal conversations.... I&#39;m amazed that people air their business like that. &nbsp;<br /><br />

				Let&#39;s say the person is talking in a normal voice on a cell phone on the subway.&nbsp; If that person was standing next to the person they were talking to instead of talking into the cell phone - having a personal conversation - would that be any different?&nbsp; Sometimes I wonder if it&#39;s just because we subconsciously want to be able to hear the other person responses, that we get so mad about the cell phone usage.&nbsp; I can understand getting upset at loud talkers, because I&#39;ll get annoyed with any loud talkers, on their cell phone or not.&nbsp; But normal voice usage?&nbsp; It&#39;s not such a big deal to me.&nbsp; I don&#39;t like to air my personal business either.&nbsp; But lots of people talk to each other on the train, right next to each other in person.&nbsp; I don&#39;t see how this differs on the cell phone.&nbsp; Either way, you&#39;re airing your business.&nbsp; And some people are loud and annoying and some are respectful and speak in a low voice.&nbsp; I guess it depends on the kind of person you are.&nbsp; With or without a cell phone.

I don&#39;t know what it is about this one friend I have - I love her dearly - but anytime we&#39;re out in public, whether it&#39;s on the train or walking down the street or whatever, I feel like she&#39;s yelling or something. And two old friends like us, she&#39;s usually yelling something I wouldn&#39;t want everyone around us to hear. I&#39;ve just had to deal, because she&#39;s always been like this, but it embarrasses the hell out of me. I feel like it&#39;s this New York etiquette thing. Loud talkers are just generally frowned upon.<br /><br />And mcw - the most disturbing part of your story for me was that she had a baby!

				A few years ago I was in Central Park attending a performance of Shakespeare in the Park. I was enjoying the show when suddenly, in the row behind me, a guy&#39;s cellphone rings. Bad enough, right? But to make matters worse, the guy answers the phone! He begins a conversation in a regular to loud voice, while all of us around him glare in amazement. In a regional accent he begins saying, &quot;Hey! No, I&#39;m out of town. I&#39;m in New York. Yeah, I&#39;m in Central Park watching Shakespeare! It&#39;s a nice night--&quot; Suddenly Captain Clueless notices his neighbors all glaring at him. &quot;Hey, I better go. I&#39;m getting some pretty dirty looks right now. Bye.&quot; All I could think as he hung up is that this guy is probably going to go home and tell the folks back there about how rude New Yorkers are!

				I wish they would jam cell phones at movie and actual theatres.&nbsp; It would save a lot of people aggravation.&nbsp; It IS illegal to use your cell phone during a performance in NYC - though the law isn&#39;t enforced.&nbsp; I&#39;ve never heard of a ticket for it, though he certainly deserved one, especially for the second call he took.

Basically, it&#39;s just a metal cage with bars closer together than the wavelength you want to shield (or maybe some multiple of the wavelength, I don&#39;t know). It&#39;s why you lose cell phone reception in some buildings and some elevators, due to parallel metal rods in some types of construction. If you build one on purpose, it can be very effective...

				Worse than loud talkers - the nextel walkie talkies. Not only do we have to hear your entire conversation at a ridiculous volume, but that beep beep drives me crazy. On the street it doesn&#39;t really bother me, but I was on the N before it went underground a couple weeks ago when a guy had an entire conversation about some girl he hooked up with the night before. Think gross details. Ugh.<br /><br />Also, I read once somewhere (couldn&#39;t find it so I can&#39;t link it) why people talk louder on cell phones. You know how on most landlines, you can hear your voice in the receiver? Its almost unnoticeable, but try blowing or tapping on a receiver next time you&#39;re on a land line. Cell phones aren&#39;t built with that capability. So we all grew up knowing what talking on a landline sounds like, and when you&#39;re talking on a cell, it almost seems muted, so we subconsciously yell. Its annoying, but ever since I read that, I&#39;ve made a conscious effort to talk quietly/normal when on a cell. I&#39;ve used my cell as my primary phone for the past year though (I don&#39;t have a landline), so I&#39;m over that :)

				Remember when mobile phones started to become more common-place? It was in the late 90&#39;s, and even then, not everyone had them. It was a bit more of a luxury to have them. Remember beepers!?

				I think the walkie talkies and text messaging are big with teenagers.&nbsp; Other people use them too, but they&#39;re definitely &quot;cool&quot; among teenagers.<br /><br />I took text messaging off my phone.&nbsp; I was getting spam for fat pills, naked pics, etc - on a brand new phone!!&nbsp; I figure people can talk to me, I like to hear people&#39;s voices anyway.&nbsp; For the time they spend trying to type in their message, they could have called and told me already.&nbsp; I understand when you are somewhere where you should be quiet, but to tell me you&#39;re late or to ask me for coffee - hey, just call.&nbsp; I get charged for these, so maybe I&#39;m just a cheapskate for wanting phonecalls instead.&nbsp; But I guess I&#39;m old-fashioned with wanting to hear people&#39;s voices.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also my phone now is so bare-bones, and it&#39;s great.&nbsp; The last time when I had that phone with all the bells and whistles, not only was there spam but the battery went out so quick, and the phone got so hot when talking for more than 5 minutes - it would burn my cheek.&nbsp; Since everyone has phones with all the features, it was probably just my phone.&nbsp; But now my battery lasts 3 days and no more nude pics!&nbsp; So f-@##$$%^ technology!&nbsp; I don&#39;t need it!

Not cool.<br /><br />As for phones, sometimes bare bones is best. I miss my old bare bones Nokia, although it would get super heated during long conversations (and as my cell is my primary means of long distance chatting, I had a LOT Of long conversations).
