Well, the North side of the track was only open for the last few months in &#039;09, but there a hell of a lot of tourists shopping at&nbsp; Century 21 who use that station to go back up town.&nbsp; I know this because I get stuck behind them as they try to figure out the turnstile gate.

				Ridership is definitely up, but the stop still has very few passengers relative to the rest of the line, has there ever been any thought of a local/express in Astoria?

				Yes, but there are more riders at Ditmars, 30th, and Broadway (according to the NY times charts created from recent MTA data anywhere from + 1,000 to +4,000 riders vs. the Astoria Boulevard, 36th, and 39th stops) and as I understand it creating express/local trains benefits both the more and less populous area/stops.&nbsp; I&#039;m certainly not an expert in civil planning or transport logistics, but a less crowded train would be lovely!

				All I know is that in the evenings when the trains are running late, they sometimes run express from QBP to Ast Blvd. But they don&#039;t tell you until QBP where you have to wait outside, which in the middle of winter is really annoying.

				I believe they&#039;ve tried express trains on the line in the past, but that they don&#039;t work very well here. If I recall what people said, the problem is the tight constraints on timing through tunnel under the river, combined with only having two spots to turn around at Ditmars. You might be able to save some people a few minutes, but they couldn&#039;t run many more trains overall, and I think the local train would get too crowded...<br /><br />

				It honestly doesn&#039;t seem worth it to me.&nbsp; I think it takes 5-7 minutes to get to my stop (Broadway) from Queensboro.&nbsp; I don&#039;t need an extra minute or two that badly.&nbsp; I like the few minutes to check my phone for messages when the train goes above ground.&nbsp; :)
