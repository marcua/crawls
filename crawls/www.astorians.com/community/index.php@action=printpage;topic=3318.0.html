				http://www.therealdeal.net/issues/SEPTEMBER_2006/1157064204.php<br />September 2006<br />Astoria, a renters&#39; haven, readies for buying wave<br />Condo projects spotlight new appeal of Queens area near Manhattan<br />By Gabby Warshawer<br /><br />A condo conversion at Ditmars Boulevard<br />The condos are coming.<br /><br />That&#39;s the big story in Astoria real estate, according to local agents. While the western Queens neighborhood has long been a popular rental choice for young professionals priced out of Manhattan, demand for condominiums keeps growing as renters become buyers.<br /><br />&quot;There&#39;s a major shortage of condos,&quot; said Steffan Partridge, an agent at Partridge Realty. &quot;There&#39;s a building boom in Astoria right now, so we&#39;re waiting for them to show up.&quot;<br /><br />At least six new condo buildings will be completed in Astoria within the next year, bringing hundreds of new apartments to the market, according to Adriano Hultmann, an associate broker at the Corcoran Group.<br /><br />Meanwhile, a warehouse conversion by Pistilli Realty at Ditmars Boulevard and 45th Street, which was slated to have 200 condo units and be finished by the end of last year, has yet to hit the market. Demand for the apartments has only grown during the extended wait.<br /><br />In a bid to lure prospective Manhattan buyers, many of the new projects are incorporating high-end touches.<br /><br />A luxury building planned by the Criterion Group at 30th Avenue and 23rd Street will have 29 units, including two 1,500-square-foot penthouses.<br /><br />Another, the Astoria Windsor at 30-80 21st Street, will also be a 29-unit luxury building. Asking prices at the Windsor average $800 per square foot.<br /><br />&quot;In general, new condos with low common charges and tax abatements go for around $600 to $750 a square foot,&quot; said Hultmann. Older condos in the area sell for about $450 to $550 a square foot, and co-ops average $250 to $350 a square foot, he said.<br /><br />Agents say the current market slowdown has meant sales prices in Astoria are holding steady rather than continually rising. But they are doing brisk business with rentals. Partridge said rents are $100 to $200 more a month than they were in April.<br /><br />&quot;If you go on Craigslist, there are almost no no-fee apartments listed in Astoria, but there used to be a ton of them,&quot; he said. &quot;There&#39;s a shortage of apartments to rent and buy.&quot;<br /><br />Although there&#39;s lots of demand for condos, Mike Demkiw, an agent with Horizon Realty, said the neighborhood lacks high-end services.<br /><br />&quot;With three senior centers, Astoria is still considered the capital of senior citizens,&quot; said Demkiw. &quot;We have Starbucks and cafes, but not many high-end retailers.&quot;<br /><br />Some prospective buyers don&#39;t mind the absence of luxury trappings.<br /><br />&quot;The one downside to Astoria is a near complete lack of bookstores, both chain and independent,&quot; said Jamie Lendino, a technology writer who has rented an apartment in Astoria for the past three years.<br /><br />Lendino, who moved to the neighborhood from Bensonhurst, said he&#39;s otherwise satisfied by Astoria&#39;s services.<br /><br />&quot;I would definitely consider buying property here,&quot; he added. &quot;The problem is that there doesn&#39;t seem to be much available.&quot;<br /><br /><br />Fresh developments may spawn city&#39;s newest neighborhood -- Lower Astoria<br /><br />Many of the larger new developments in Astoria are planned for the area west of 21st Street, said Adriano Hultmann, an associate broker at Corcoran. This section of the neighborhood -- which Hultmann calls Lower Astoria in much the same style real estate agents created Nolita and the dubious East Williamsburg district -- extends to the East River, is more industrial than residential, and has a large supply of warehouse space.<br /><br />&quot;There are virtually no large lots for development in the heart of Astoria,&quot; said Hultmann.<br /><br />&quot;I get calls every day for loft space in that area,&quot; said Steffan Partridge, an agent at Partridge Realty.<br /><br />Partridge said most of this part of Astoria isn&#39;t zoned for residential development and, while people are clamoring for housing there, warehouses are sitting empty.<br /><br />&quot;Four brothers recently invested $1.3 million in a high-end lounge there, and they&#39;re at the forefront of the neighborhood,&quot; said Partridge, referring to Hell Gate Social, a new bar at 12-21 Astoria Boulevard.<br /><br />&quot;It&#39;s also close to [Long Island City&#39;s] Socrates Sculpture Park and the Noguchi Museum,&quot; he said. &quot;A lot of sophisticated people want to live around there.&quot;

And I&#39;m sure that these tail-of-the-boom condo developments won&#39;t be much better, aesthetically, than the building that&#39;s being referred to; if anything, their lousy timing will probably make them be more &quot;unique&quot; (read: &quot;stick out in some horrible way even more&quot;).

				Mirki2 - do you think Astoria has more senior centers than other areas? I&#39;d never thought that - I thought that was an interesting remark in the article.&nbsp; I know when I worked in Lower Manhattan, they had about 15 senior centers in an area as geographically compact as Astoria, so I find it hard to see Astoria as being the &quot;senior capital&quot;.<br />I like the nice mention of Hellgate Social.

As for Astoria, it has less senior centers than Jamaica or Flushing but more than other areas of queens (at least it seemed that way when I looked on the DFTA website)... either way, I do believe it&#39;s one of the neighborhoods with a high concentration of frail elderly, i.e. 85 and older and still residing in the community homebound or not.<br /><br />

				http://www.queenswest.com/neighborhood/discussion/00010775<br /><br />Went to view Hallet&#39;s Cove yesterday and in my opinion the finishes and appliances were very low end. The lowest end stainless steel appliances and the lowest end toilets, sinks, and tubs you could find. The kitchens were also small with a little dishwasher. How could they expect you to pay in some instances over $700 a square foot for apartments with bathrooms in the great room. They were not planned too well. The one bedrooms were passable but the two bedrooms left alot to be desired. I was told it was 65% sold but I don&#39;t know what the people who bought were looking at. Also, the location is distant from public transportation. The Q103 doesn&#39;t run at night or on Sunday.<br />If the building were located in Hunter&#39;s Point I would consider it an option but for what they are offering and for where it is It is a very poor second choice to Hunter&#39;s Point.<br />

				Interesting how a lot of these new condos install electric heaters.&nbsp; I would never buy into something with that.&nbsp; Hallet&#39;s Cove has that (it&#39;s near Costco).&nbsp; Everything seems to be so cheaply built and small these days.&nbsp; Frustrating when you see the price tag and the long walk to the train, just what is supposed to make the place desirable?

				My guess is that most of the people buying these units have no intention of living in them but intend to sublease them. So who cares about the appointments: they are barracks.<br /><br />These new projects contributed to the brown out. They require very expensive connections (at no cost to the developer) to the electric grid that is absorbing Con Ed&#39;s resources that used to go into maintaining the grid. This might explain why all the new development seemed immune to the brown out. Check out the chat room in Queens West during the brown out crisis: it hardly made a ripple in their postings.<br /><br />Now here are the two kickers.<br /><br />1. Most of the postings that talk about these large projects note they are being built far away from good transportation. Anyone looking at the &#39;Greenway&#39; (that has poor links to Astoria proper) as the leading edge for &quot;East River Boulevard?&quot; A developer &#39;bene&#39; paid of course, by our taxes.<br /><br />2. If &#39;affordable housing&#39; is so important, should we not seek to overturn all the downzoning that is going on in the other 90% of Queens. Shouldn&#39;t all neighborhoods &#39;share the wealth?&#39;<br /><br />[BTW, check out yesterday&#39;s Times: pg72 Magazine: &quot;Bloomberg hopes to reconnect downtown to both the Hudson and East Rivers by encircling the neighborhood with a necklace of public parkland.&quot;]<br /><br />

				The prices just rise and rise, it&#39;s impossible to keep up with them.&nbsp; Where do all these wealthy people come from who are raising the prices?&nbsp; I&#39;m relatively happy with my apartment, but I would be much happier with one more room (it&#39;s either that or learn to be less of a packrat).&nbsp; I cringe when I hear about how much one bedrooms are renting for in Astoria and the &quot;affordable&quot; housing, which I generally think is a good thing, is either for the very poor or for people who make a heck of a lot more than I do.&nbsp; No one seems to be building for the folks in the middle anymore.

				mcdirk, I think the upward pressure on rents stems from a warped market: one family or one person is not expected to live in a single apartment. The market rents are geared for multiple dwellers in each unit, be it several families living together, or a number of college grads sharing space. With the non-existant code enforcement, absentee landlords are creating this perverted market.<br /><br />It was like this 100 years ago in the Lower East Side and Harlem where landlords took advantage of people by hiking up rents to astronomical levels. Rent parties are part of the legend of Harlem&#39;s early years.<br /><br />The point I like is that &#39;affordable housing&#39; is a fantasy. It can only help a few thousand people each year and simply moves the savings from &#39;affordable rent&#39; to increased taxes to pay for the infrastructure costs. <br /><br />Making &#39;housing affordable&#39; through lower taxes and bringing in good paying jobs helps everyone pay their rent easier or get a better place - without a cent to infrastructure.

				The prices will come down, they are already on their way down. Maybe not so much in the new developments- that will happen once the developers start to realize that no one is buying- but the prices of existing units are going down, and apartments are remaining on the market longer. The rising interest rates are certainly not encoraging people to buy. All in all, the development is not sustainable, but it will take a little time for people to realize that.&nbsp; <br /><br />Unfortunately however, I have serious doubts it will ever be possible to buy a house in NYC for 80,000 (at least not until we have to devalue our curency due to absurd inflation)

				Far be it for me to rain on anyone&#039;s parade, but the word &quot;luxury&quot; is overused in real estate development.&nbsp; &nbsp;I was out for my jog this weekend and couldn&#039;t get across 21st Street so I decided to go down 21st instead of trying to cross it to get home and noticed that the two new apartment buildings on the west side of 21st Street next to Newtown Ave. are rising fast and furious.&nbsp; &nbsp;The bigger of the two developments is the one right on the corner where the gas station used to be is not as far along as the slim building right next door, which looks to be nearing completion or is closer to completion that its neighbor.&nbsp; &nbsp;What struck me is that the almost completed building has a sign outside calling the units &quot;luxury.&quot;&nbsp; It looks like a nice building, but calling it &quot;luxury&quot; is a bit of a stretch, especially for a building on a relatively non-descript block such as the one it sits on.&nbsp; &nbsp;

There is a &#039;luxury&#039; building going up on 35th St. between Astoria Blvd. and 28th Avenue. It&#039;s located across the street from the police station, is completely surrounded by much smaller (and older) apartment buildings, and doesn&#039;t even have that many amenities. For heaven&#039;s sake, it&#039;s going to have a &quot;virtual&quot; doorman. What IS that?? How does that count as luxury?? <br />
