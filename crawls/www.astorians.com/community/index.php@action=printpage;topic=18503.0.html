				Just wondering which bars/restaurants will be showing the games in Astoria.<br />I&#039;m guessing the Brazilian place on Bway and 31st will be... Any others?

				Don&#039;t know anything for sure, but I&#039;m guessing Cronin &amp; Phelan&#039;s will have the games, and probably the beer garden.

				I saw a sign in the window of Yolo, on 31st Street near Ditmars Blvd., that they&#039;re showing all the games. <br />I would think probably Astoria Brewhouse - formerly Indigo - on 31st near 30th Ave. will be too since they&#039;re<br />under the same ownership.<br /><br />And probably the Irish pubs over in Woodside like Starting Gate and others will have them as well.<br /><br />But most, if not all, are on either ESPN, ABC or Univision. I think the full TV schedule is on espn.com<br /><br />

				Athens Cafe has set up two big flat panel displays back to back in the seating area on the curb. Just noticed that yesterday. Too bad Greece lost though... kinda dampens the spirits a bit.

				What&#039;s the best place to go Saturday afternoon for the USA vs Ghana game? Do you think the Bohemian Beer Garden will be the best atmosphere, or is there another place that would be better?

				I went to Studio Square for the Brazil game on Sunday. It was packed, so my recommendation is to get there VERY early if you go on Saturday. That probably applies to anywhere you go to watch the US/Ghana game. The crowd on Sunday was having the best time and the bar brought out samba dancers and drummers during the halves of the game. So festive and fun!

				I&#039;m planning on going to Studio Square on Saturday and will expect nothing less than madness!&nbsp; I think for a 2pm game we are going to get there around 11 (maybe even a little earlier).&nbsp; Kegs &#039;n eggs, anyone? <br /><br />Regardless, it should be a great time.&nbsp;
