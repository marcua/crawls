				Forget all the great restaurants to visit...how about when we are being lazy and order from home? <br /><br />These are my seamless choices:<br /><br />Sushi:<br />GoWasabi - I like their quality and size of a la cart pieces, though they are pricey.<br />SushiX - Smaller pieces, but godo quality, and a la carte is $1 each!<br /><br />Italian:<br />Dino&#039;s - After trying several places that sucked (Sac&#039;s too expensive, Gaudio&#039;s seemed like Ragu), Dino&#039;s was deliscious, though I wisht hey gave larger portions.<br /><br />TexMex:<br />Fresca Tortilla (36th Ave) - No matter where I am in Astoria, they arrive in 10 minutes. It&#039;s messy, greasy food, but yummy, cheap and reliable. My most-ordered after all these years. <br /><br />Burgers:<br />Takeout or sit-down, Bareburger is the only burger place I&#039;ll eat (beef on bread is otherwise pretty boring). Though I admit they&#039;ve messed up my orders a few times. <br /><br />I am looking for suggestions on Middle Eastern (namely Afghan), and a good place for various, basic chicken food. Anyone got anything?

				I don&#039;t know if you live within the delivery area of Balkh, but they&#039;re very good.&nbsp; They&#039;re near Bohemian Hall. http://www.yelp.com/biz/balkh-shish-kabab-house-astoria<br />&nbsp;

				Crave - just off 30th Avenue does quick, fast, healthy and affordable food - Greek-themes.<br /><br /><br />Zorba&#039;s Souvlaki is also very reliable.&nbsp; Good salads and meat.<br /><br /><br />Leng Thai is, in my opinion, the best Thai in Astoria and they are very quick with deliveries.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Dandara and Duzan both do middle-eastern and they&#039;re affordable, high quality and reliable seamless options.

				For middle eastern Duzan is our go to. Their hummus, falafel and shwarma are all really great, and it&#039;s really inexpensive. I haven&#039;t had anything there that I&#039;ve found less than delicious.

				McDirk - If I remember correctly, you live somewhat near me.&nbsp; Zorba&#039;s delivers to the Broadway area?&nbsp; If so, awesome.&nbsp; Years ago I use to eat there all the time when I lived just off 23rd Ave.

				Given the work schedule &amp; hours we keep, I totally rely on pick-up and delivery options during week nights.&nbsp; We live by Astoria Park and interestingly enough the delivery options will vary depending on if you&#039;re looking at Seamless vs. GrubHub vs. Eat24, etc.&nbsp; Here are some faves<br /><br />- Mike&#039;s Diner doesn&#039;t sound so great on paper, but honestly their food is really good.&nbsp; Breakfast can be a great adventure with them - whole grain oatmeal pancakes, add walnuts.&nbsp; And if you order an egg dish, try the grits instead of potatoes - a nice surprise!&nbsp; Excellent burger and the steak tips saute with mushrooms &amp; onions is a winner too!<br /><br />- Mia pizza (formerly Sandros) - food is great, straightforward American Italian and the owner will even call sometimes to see how you liked the food - no joke!&nbsp; Soups are excellent and totally home made, veal parm, manicotti and the white pizza with spinach is a win-win.&nbsp; Even if you don&#039;t want a whole pie, they&#039;ll do the baby pizza size for you.<br /><br />- Ancla - peruvian fried rice will beat any Asian fried rice, hands down!&nbsp; We usually do beef or shrimp.&nbsp; Ceviche is outstanding, roasted chicken spot on (ask for Garlic Sauce on the side).&nbsp; There&#039;s a choloca corn and cheese dish too that&#039;s fresh, simple &amp; great.&nbsp; Seamless is a godsend as they speak terrible English over the phone.&nbsp; Service is very kind if you go there live and the language barrier doesn&#039;t seem as extreme in person, but unless you speak Spanish, don&#039;t expect to get very far over the phone with any delivery mixups.&nbsp; <br /><br />
