				I saw a little of it.&nbsp; I thought &quot;Rents Too High&quot; was Samuel L. Jackson in disguise.&nbsp; A caller to NY1&#039;s recap referred to the female candidate as &quot;the chick with the blonde hair&quot; - what else <em>would</em> you call her?&nbsp; <br /><br />The &quot;debate&quot; didn&#039;t change my mind - I&#039;m voting for Cuomo.&nbsp;

				I&#039;m still with Cuomo, who will be amazing, but loved McMillan of the Rent is TOO DAMN HIGH Party (though I hear he&#039;s got issues concerning anti-semitism, so while I find his presentation entertaining, I have never been able to vote for him).

				Yes, but Jimmy McMillian didn&#039;t do anything to cause the subprime banking crisis:<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivmL-lXNy64<br /><br />So at least he has that going for him.<br /><br />And, at least to my knowledge, he never played Marilyn Monroe to the hooker screwing, abusing police force governor Elliot Spitzer like Andy did:<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWnBhD0hcqM <br /><br />So nope, still going for the rent is too damn high guy. He may screw up royally in the future, but Andy&#039;s got it on his resume right now.
