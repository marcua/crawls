				I ordered from Apicius today, they were very fast but the salad was much better than the pasta (the salad was great - arugula with walnuts and olives). I feel like Wave Thai takes forever even though I live so close (like their food though).

				I have to try Petey&#039;s! We did get some great pancakes and wraps from Soho. Haven&#039;t ordered from Aphrodite yet.<br /><br />I tried to call Vesta last night but they said they can only deliver if they have a certain amount of people working and the guy wasn&#039;t there when I called.

				If you are only a block or two outside of the delivery zone Petey&#039;s will likely bend the rules for you.&nbsp; I&#039;m technically out of their area by a block but just asked nicely when I was in there one day and they added all my info to the system and said it wasn&#039;t a problem.&nbsp;

				What have you had delivered from Othello? We usually just get breakfast there on weekends.<br /><br />Props to Bangkok Tasty- last night when I called, they already had the address on file AND they guy came to the side door as requested- usually delivery people go to the front door and the landlord comes downstairs before we know they&#039;re there.

				Wanted to revive this post for new ideas.&nbsp; We&#039;re without a kitchen right now &amp; are getting a bit tired of BelAire Diner, Thai Pavillion (the new one in Pistilli), Brothers Pizza (14th street).&nbsp; Very disappointed when I called Seva to hear they made their delivery area smaller and cut us out.&nbsp; <br /><br />Any suggestions for the Astoria Park (Hoyt South) area would be great!<br /><br />

They&#039;ve got a &#039;closed for vacation till August 11th&#039; sign on their door, and that sign has been there all month while the place has remained closed. I know the bar is renovating--are they renovating Lava, too?<br /><br />As for delivery, we order from Wave Thai, Forno Italia, Pinocchio Restaurant, Watawa, Seva, Ghandi, Balkh Shish Kabab, and Michaelangelo&#039;s pretty often, and they&#039;ve all been fine. (We&#039;re in the lower Ditmars area.) I wish Pita Hot delivered! <br /><br />

				Last night we tried Aphrodite (33rd/Ditmars) for the first time &amp; really enjoyed.&nbsp; We tend to enjoy Cypriot style and the sheftalia diner platter, dolmades (hot) appetizer, beet salad &amp; halloumi were all winners.&nbsp; The Loukaniko sausage sandwich with Halloumi was also delish - great bread, not pita.&nbsp; Loukaniko can vary from place to place with very different flavors.&nbsp; This one didn&#039;t have the orange flavor, but instead just a nice robust spicy blend.&nbsp; Definitely all home made food, not something that came from Krinos.&nbsp; Will be calling them again soon!&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;

				Lately we&#039;ve been enjoying Spiced on Ditmars. It&#039;s not super cheap, but it&#039;s a good value for the quality of the food.

				We need more Astoria places to get on SeamlessWeb.&nbsp; I&#039;ve used this for delivery here and in Manhattan and its great.&nbsp; From where I am in Astoria (31st Ave) only 21 places currently on there and a good number of them are basics (pizza, diner, Coldstone, etc.).&nbsp; Though the site does include Yajai, Seva, Red Basil Thai, Pita Pan, Pinocchio Palace, Cafe Bar and BZ Grill.

				delivery.com has several Astoria restaurants.&nbsp; I&#039;ll only order from ones without a delivery fee, although I bet if you were to call the same restaurant for delivery, they would deliver for free.

				Like everyone else says, Petey&#039;s is great.&nbsp; I usually order from places on 30th Ave bcs I live right off it.&nbsp; Chicken Shack (souvlaki, big salads, ribs, roast chicken) on the 30th Ave/35th St has tasty food and is always open late.&nbsp; Akti (Greek seafood--great whole fish, best fish croquettes EVER), across the street, is also great.&nbsp; They&#039;re a little pricier, but we often eat at their restaurant and found that when we ordered delivery, the portions were actually larger than what you&#039;d get at the restaurant, for the same price.&nbsp; Great deal.
