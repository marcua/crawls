				I need advice on getting my ears pierced. I have never had it done (long story), but I have always always ALWAYS liked jewelry and have for years considered doing it. Now that I&#039;m getting to a certain age, I figure it&#039;s time, but I have to say I&#039;m nervous as hell because I don&#039;t like needles and everything I&#039;m finding online ranges from it doesn&#039;t hurt at all to it hurts a lot.<br /><br />So.<br /><br />1. Where should I get it done? Is it better to go to a doctor&#039;s office? Is it better to go to a piercing/tattoo shop?<br />2. What was your experience like? How old were you? Were any of you as old as me? (As of right now, still 29, thank you very much.)<br />3. What are the best earrings to buy? Hypoallergenic?<br />4. Am I too old for this? And am I acting like a ninny*?<br /><em><br />*nin·ny <br />n.&nbsp; &nbsp;pl. nin·nies<br />A fool; a simpleton.</em>

				no you&#039;re not acting like a ninny.<br />my first holes were done when i was a couple years old. they used needles on me. i dont remember it. thank god. <br />i got a second set of holes at Claire&#039;s. they used a &#039;gun&#039;. it just pierces the lobe with the studs that you&#039;ve chosen and those need to remain in the holes for the next 3 mos. (or something like that) need to turn the piercings, and clean everything very well so you dont get an infection. it will ache for a couple days. after the healing time, make sure you always have some earrings in! that way the holes dont close up! <br /><br />my skin is sensitive to other materials so i can only use real gold, or real sterling silver. <br /><br />i got my nose pierced in 2004 at a tatoo / piercing place. they used a needle and it was kinda nerve wracking, but it&#039;s the best thing. the person did a great job of fitting my peircing to my nose shape. and i absolutely love my nose piercing. please do not get your nose pierced with a gun. it just looks lame.

They are the experts. I doubt if the average doctor has ever done an ear piercing.<br /><br />2) I was 9, but my best friend did her ears when she turned 35. I had to go to her house every single day to keep the lobes clean and move the earrings so that there would be no infection. Now, she changes her earrings in a moving car without a mirror. You just get used to it!<br /><br />3) If you have a known allergy avoid that metal, but you would do well to buy a small pair of 14 KT snap-in hoops or small, solid ball studs. Some places may still use a thread that requires turning every few hours. Ask before you do it. Find the way that makes you most comfortable. If you have someone who can help you during your timidness to touch them at home for a few days, all the better.<br /><br />4) You are absolutely not too old to do this. It will change your life. You will enjoy having earrings as part of your clothing accessories. The same way you might wear different bracelets and necklaces, you will find yourself matching earrings. Once the holes heal, and you learn how to put in an earring by yourself, with or without a mirror, you will love shopping for new inexpensive ones. Or better yet, you may start to look forward to getting gifts of them.<br /><br />I&#039;ll make this offer online so that you know I will follow-through for you. <br /><br />Would you like me to take you to your place of choice? I will hold your hand, and comfort you if you feel like puking or crying. Then I will take you for a drink. Get you somewhat s___-faced and then drop you off at home. I&#039;ll also give you a bottle of hydrogen peroxide to keep the lobes clean. Let me know.

				I got my ear done at a tatoo-piercing place.&nbsp; &nbsp;What they can do with a needle that they can&#039;t do with a gun, is compensate for the shape of your lobe.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I got a little hoopty thing and they angled it with the needle so that it is more back to front than just perpendicular to my lobe (which is what a gun would have done).<br /><br />Bigger needle than I expected, but very little pain.&nbsp; &nbsp;(or maybe I just have a higher tolerance than I thought)<br /><br />*insert clever words of encouragement here*<br /><br />&nbsp;:lol:

				Getting it done at a tattoo/piercing place is just fine.&nbsp; I had my very first piercings (I have 3 in each ear) at a jewelry place and they used a gun.&nbsp; I was 13.&nbsp; I had the other 4 done at a tattoo place on Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley in my early 30s.&nbsp; They used a needle.&nbsp; I believe the needle is better - the gun slams the stud through your ear.&nbsp; The needle actually removes skin.&nbsp; Many people believe the needle is better - the recovery is quicker, it&#039;s a cleaner hole.<br /><br />After I got those 4 holes, they gave me an orange soda to drink, which was supposed to bring my blood sugar back up (?).&nbsp; It might have been some weird urban myth kind of thing, but I sucked down that soda like there was no tomorrow. I don&#039;t like soda all that much.<br /><br />I think mine were/are all 14K gold.&nbsp; Hypoallergenic is good.&nbsp; Plated metals are not good.<br /><br />These days I keep gold hoops in all my piercings.&nbsp; I&#039;ve thought about changing them. At some point I will.<br /><br />I think the amount of pain just depends on who you are and what you tolerance for pain is.&nbsp; Me, I have a low tolerance for pain.&nbsp; So, my 4 hurt pretty bad by the last piercing.&nbsp; They ached for a couple of days but tapered off after that.&nbsp; I will never get my nose done because 1) I don&#039;t believe it hardly hurts, like friends have told me, and 2) I believe I would look ridiculous with a nose piercing - I&#039;m way too pasty looking.<br /><br />You&#039;re certainly not too old!&nbsp; Have fun!&nbsp; It goes fast.

				Thanks everybody! Hopefully I&#039;ll respond to you all and let you know that I did it, but I&#039;m not making any promises. Sounds like the needle is the way to go, though.<br /><br />Although I watched this video (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1D4os5Q0OA) and it really grossed me out.

				I&#039;ve mentioned them in a couple of other threads I can&#039;t find at the moment, but I would highly recommend Venus Modern Body Arts (http://www.venusbymariatash.com/index.php?section=piercing) in the East Village - 199 E 4th Street, just east of Avenue A.&nbsp; I took a friend there for her first ear piercing, and I think she was really pleased.&nbsp; She was roughly the same age you are, so I don&#039;t think you are too old.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think you need to go to a doctor&#039;s office (I have to say I didn&#039;t even realise that you could get your ears pierced at a doctor&#039;s office!), but you should definitely go to a reputable place (not like me at 17 at the Jersey Shore...).&nbsp; I got a fourth ear piercing at Venus about two years ago, and it was the first one I had done that used a needle rather than a gun.&nbsp; I expected it to hurt more, but it hurt less.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t painless, but honestly, 99% of the pain was <em>after</em> the earring was in, and it wasn&#039;t a sharp pain, but rather more of a general achiness as others have mentioned.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t even realise she had done the piercing until after it was finished - it was that quick and smooth.<br /><br />As a couple of people mentioned, be careful of the metal used.&nbsp; I developed an allergy to nickel that I still have because of my first piercing (at age 12), because either the gun or the cheap studs contained nickel.&nbsp; That&#039;s one thing you won&#039;t have to worry about if you go to Venus - they use only surgical steel.

				It seems like you&#039;re leaning toward going to a professional peircer anyway, but as someone who knows people in the business and has had lots of tatts and peircings, never never never never let someone peirce you with a gun. Always have it done with the hollow needles the pros use. I could really go on and on about why, but the guns cause trauma to your body and because they don&#039;t remove the flesh where the hole is going (hollow needles actually remove the skin) they are more likely to get infected or be unable to grow closed normally.<br /><br />The one peircing I had done by a gun would not heal right.<br /><br />Also, make sure to start keeping salt in the bathroom. A soak or rinse in hot salt water can do wonders for sore or swollen new peircings.

I was very nervous about it as I had never been pierced before at all, but found it was very uneventful and straightforward and not very painful at all. I followed their instructions on how to care for the wound and I&#039;ve had absolutely no problems. I would highly recommend them. I do recommend taking a friend with you, it keeps you calm :)

				This a great thread!<br /><br />I&#039;m thinking of getting my ears re-pierced.&nbsp; I had them pierced when I was 7 and I believe it was with a gun.&nbsp; I wore earring up until I was in high school and stopped wearing them because it seemed like a developed an allergy to all metals except the hypoallergenic kind that you get your ears pierced with.&nbsp; Right now the holes are mostly closed.&nbsp; I suppose if I fought with it I could get an earring in...but OOOWW!&nbsp; Anyway, I&#039;m now thinking about it because on a few occasions my boyfriend has mentioned that it&#039;d be nice to buy me earrings from time to time.
