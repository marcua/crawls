			So, my neighbor moved out at the last minute and left a beautiful cedar bedframe on the curb. &nbsp;As I assisted her to move it down the stairs, I realized someone could really fall in love with a bed like this (me if I didn't have one I love already)- yet, alas, she must get it out of her apartment pronto. &nbsp;<br /><br />I believe the bed size is a full- (My bed is a queen-and-a-half, and it's the next size up.) &nbsp;It is a box-shaped bed with drawers along the sides for storage; and it looks and smells like it is completely made of real cedar. &nbsp;It is yours if you can pick it up before our trashman comes.<br /><br />The bed is in pieces in front of 22-65 27th St. in Astoria. &nbsp;If you need directions or have questions please call 646-637-7174. &nbsp;Please do not call repeatedly- I promise I will call back if you leave a message. &nbsp;ALSO, DO NOT REPLY TO THIS E-MAIL, OR YER OUTTA LUCK! &nbsp;I'm at home with no e-mail, so you must call the number above if you need to reach me! &nbsp;Ok!<br /><br />P.S.- The bed is free, but if you see it and would LIKE to make a donation for it, you could surprise my neighbor and send her a check at her new place. &nbsp;Totally optional. &nbsp;She'd &nbsp;really apreciate it. &nbsp;Ask me about it if you so choose; I'm not going to ask you for money, it's up to you!
