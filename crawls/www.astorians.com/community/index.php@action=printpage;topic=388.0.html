				I just got this post from MoveOn.org with location for tomorrow's rally. &nbsp;Please read if interested and attend and pass on to friends! &nbsp;Looks like it will be more interesting than most rallys.<br /><br />___________________________________<br /><br /><strong>Dear New York area MoveOn member,<br /><br />Thanks to the dogged efforts of our friends at People For the American Way, we finally have a location and permit for our rally in Manhattan. Here’s the info for the Rally to Stop the Judicial Takeover:<br /><br />Rally with People for the American Way &amp; Americans for Fair Courts <br />Thomas Paine Park (aka Foley Square), across from the U.S. Courthouse <br />5 PM Wednesday <br />Downtown, at the intersection of Worth St. and Centre St., 2 blocks East of Broadway <br />Take the 4/5/6/ to Brooklyn Bridge/City Hall or the J/M/Z/ to Chambers St. and walk one block north on Centre St. until you see Foley Square. For a detailed subway and bus map of Lower Manhattan, see http://www.mta.nyc.ny.us/nyct/maps/lowermanhattan.pdf <br />With almost 3,000 people signed up, this will be the largest single MoveOn gathering ever! It will also be an incredible moment in the fight to stop the “nuclear option” and defend our courts.<br /><br />Please be there, rain or shine, and bring your friends.<br /><br />IMPORTANT RALLY INSTRUCTIONS<br /><br />We’re trying something new tomorrow that we think will make this rally more fun and more effective than most. If you've ever been to a rally before, you know that too often, you show up, you don't talk to anyone, you hear a few boring speeches that go on too long, and you leave. As a participant, your job is basically to sit back and listen.<br /><br />Not this time. Our basic plan: use an interactive format where the &quot;talking heads&quot; are chosen by the crowd and you get to meet other folks in your community; and create powerful images that will communicate the threat of a right-wing judicial takeover and boost media coverage<br /><br />This plan will ensure that we have a real impact. And it should make for a unique and compelling experience. But it depends entirely on you. Please read these instructions now, and bring a copy of our one page summary to the rally, which you can find at:<br /><br />http://www.moveonpac.org/rallyhelp/infosheet.pdf<br /><br />You may also want to print and bring a sheet of rally chants, at http://www.moveonpac.org/rallyhelp/chants.pdf<br /><br />Basically, we're putting the success of these rallies in your hands. So pitch in—if you see that people are milling around and not forming into clusters, encourage them to group up (as we explain below). Tell speakers if you can't hear them, and encourage them to wrap up if they're rambling. If your group is bogged down, ask a question to get things moving. Bring a few extra signs to distribute. Make sure people stay positive and respectful. On Wednesday, we'll all need to be leaders. If you have questions, go to:<br /><br />http://www.moveonpac.org/rallyhelp/faq.html?id=5460-2871443-HsAM2fivvfwJois06xm2Qw&amp;t=6<br /><br />CHOOSING YOUR SPEAKERS<br /><br />We've consistently found MoveOn members to be the most eloquent and passionate advocates for our values—far more compelling to listen to than many movement &quot;leaders.&quot; So we'll have members do the talking at our rallies, but in a way that minimizes the droning of speakers who don't know when to wrap up, or the &quot;tyranny of the annoying&quot; that sometimes afflicts rallies with open mikes. Here's how it'll work.<br /><br />The basic drill:<br /><br />5:15-5:30 Everyone clusters into small groups, explains why they came, and then the groups choose one speaker. <br />5:30 - 5:50 Each person chosen by a small group speaks for 2-3 minutes to a larger group of 100-150 people. <br />The nitty gritty: The rallies start at 5:00—try to get there on time. At about 5:15, everyone should cluster with people nearby to form groups of 8-10. First, say your name, and why you think this issue is important (go around in a circle). Second, if you were particularly moved by anyone, nominate them to speak to a larger group. Third, as a group, choose one of the people nominated—they'll speak for 2-3 minutes along with the speakers chosen by other small groups.<br /><br />The Manhattan rally will likely exceed 2000 people! But because this is a “self-organized” rally, we will not have amplified sound. &nbsp;So at about 5:30, on your own, your group should merge with the groups around you to form a &quot;supergroup&quot; of 100 or so people—few enough that you can hear someone speak without a megaphone (at this point, a soapbox will come in handy!) Then the speakers nominated by each small group should speak to everyone in the &quot;supergroup.&quot; Think of it as a throwback to the public square in the days before electricity.<br /><br />Choosing a speaker to represent your group doesn't need to be a very formal or involved process. If there's unanimity, great. If not, anyone who gets more than 60% of the votes can be your rep. You can decline a nomination (i.e. refuse to speak), but please don't nominate yourself.<br /><br />Three things to think about in choosing a speaker:<br /><br />Will this person say something you think others should hear? <br />Will they keep their remarks brief, so others have a chance? <br />Often in activist groups, a few people tend to dominate discussion. Sometimes there are people with very important things to say who tend to be drowned out because they aren't quite as confident or assertive—and this tends to decrease the diversity of leaders and speakers at events like this. So, without forcing someone to talk who doesn't want to, think about whether you have an opportunity to let someone speak who otherwise wouldn't be heard <br />Speakers, see below for further instructions.<br /><br />LOOKING GOOD<br /><br />We could just stand on the street corner holding signs that say &quot;Stop the Takeover&quot; and &quot;No Right-wing judges,&quot; and it'd work fine. But we've decided to do something a little more creative, humorous, and visually striking, to boost media coverage and create a scene that catches the attention of people passing by.<br /><br />So we've tried to site rallies in front of a courthouse or federal building wherever possible. When we're not in small groups, we're going to do the best we can to spread out in front of the building to form a mock cordon (without actually blocking anyone coming or going). We'll carry placards which resemble common Keep Out/Private Property/No Entry signs, but which read &quot;Right-Wing Judges Only/By Order of Congress&quot; and &quot;Ordinary Americans KEEP OUT.&quot; This will dramatize, in stark visual terms, Republican leaders' basic plan: seize control of the judicial nominations process, and use that to take the courts away from the American people and turn them into a tool of right-wing special interests.<br /><br />So please go to our materials page ( http://www.moveonpac.org/rallyhelp/materials.html) and print out copies of the signs we've created. During the beginning of the rally and as much as possible during the program, stand with the courthouse behind you, and your sign facing outward (this will be hard during the &quot;small groups&quot; and &quot;speakers&quot; portions, but do what you can). It's especially important to do this when you see TV cameras or newspaper photographers shooting photos. And if anyone asks you why we're holding these signs, tell them something like:<br /><br />&quot;Right now, radical Republicans in the Senate are trying to get absolute power over our courts so they can nominate judges who will strike down environmental laws, the minimum wage, even our right to privacy. These signs show what they're trying to do: seize our courts, and lock out the interests of ordinary Americans. These extremist Republicans want to jam through judges who will favor a right-wing agenda and tell everyone else to 'keep out.' But we're not going to let it happen.&quot; <br /><br />One final note: Please stay on public property. Don't block the street or building entrances and exits. Follow all local laws and the instructions of local police, and stay respectful towards people with whom you disagree. There are all kinds of people coming to these rallies, and we want to keep them safe for everyone, regardless of age, political experience, or legal status.<br /><br />SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SPEAKERS <br /><br />At around 5:30, your small group should merge with the small groups around you – but don’t let your “supergroup” become so big that you can’t hear someone speak unamplified. &nbsp;You, and the &nbsp;speakers chosen by the other small groups should find each other, and then you should each speak to the “supergroup” for 2-3 minutes (in whatever order you choose). You should cut things off around 5:50, even if a few people haven't spoken. If you are brief, more people will have a chance to speak.<br /><br />Some tips for speaking:<br /><br />Talk, in personal terms, about why YOU think this issue is important, and what you think is at stake. Try to focus on one important point. Don't try to summarize what everyone in your group said. <br />Be louder than you think you need to be! It's hard to hear outside without amplification. <br />If you can, reference the &quot;keep out/right-wing judges only&quot; theme of our signs. <br />Our basic message is &quot;Radical Republicans in the Senate want absolute power over our courts so they can nominate judges who will strike down environmental laws, the minimum wage, even our right to privacy.&quot; Speak from your heart, but don't stray too far from this message (i.e. avoid the temptation to rant about topics that are important and related, but not really the focus of the rally). <br />Keep it brief. <br />Don't worry—you'll be great! <br />----------<br /><br />That's it! It may sound like a lot but it's not hard and it should for a very powerful event.<br /><br />This is a critical moment to send a powerful message to Democrats and Republicans alike that Americans won’t stand for this absurd right-wing judicial takeover. So print out some signs, and we’ll see you there!<br /><br />–Justin Ruben, MoveOn PAC<br />&nbsp; Tuesday, April 26th, 2005<br />PAID FOR BY MOVEON PAC<br />Not authorized by any candidate or candidate's committee. </strong>
