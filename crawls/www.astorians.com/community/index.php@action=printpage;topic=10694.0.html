				If you live in astoria anywhere near the water long enough, you have encountered one of these. My first encounter was the first summer I moved here. I have to be honest in that I have a totally irrational fear of them and would rather come face to face with a mouse than a friggin giant roach (aka a waterbug).<br /><br />Well, my mother lives in New Orleans where they have them and THEY FLY. She too has this irrational fear but loves her city and will not move.&nbsp; They come in from outside so even if your house is spotless, you can still get them. And trust me they will scare the CRAP out of you when you see one climbing across your countertop or even worse..*shudder* nightstand. <br /><br />Anyway, My mom suggested this Bug Vacuum that my brother got her for xmas. It sucks them up, then electrocutes them then all you have to do is dispose of the body. So I was THRILLED because usually what I do (after screaming like a maniac) is unloading half a can of raid on them (they dont die easily and I can NOT squish them). Anyway, this thing comes on its own charger and my mother swears it works. So Astorian neighbors.. thank me later.. Here is the link<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Lentek-Koolatron-Vacuum-Control-Recharger/dp/B000A4D09E/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=garden&amp;qid=1212381863&amp;sr=1-2<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;(http://www.amazon.com/Lentek-Koolatron-Vacuum-Control-Recharger/dp/B000A4D09E/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=garden&amp;qid=1212381863&amp;sr=1-2)<br /><br />Hope this helps someone in their fight against the nasty monsters. I have kitties so putting boric acid everywhere was just not an option in my house. I did put some boric acid in the kitchen in areas where the cats cant get to, but still. Its getting warmer so.. they will be coming soon.

				I just moved here, and my landlord says the whole building is bug free, but despite that usually dubious claim, I believe him because he was concerned about me bring roaches from my last apartment, plus its been a month with no bugs so far..<br /><br />Either way, I have to say that is the coolest thing I have ever seen.. I wish I would have had that in the last 2 years before this..<br /><br />Thanks for the heads up!!

				Does that thing work on mosquitoes? I was absolutely furious with the mosquitoes that kept getting into my room last year and biting me while I slept. So many bites. We had one or two giant flying roaches last year and they are gross, but the mosquitoes personally offend me and I would like them to die. They kept going up to the ceiling where I couldn&#039;t reach them.

				OK so far, the ones in my house didnt fly because if they did, there would be a thread on here titled &quot;whats going on by the con ed power plant?&quot; because I would be FREAKING OUT. UGH! So please let me just believe they dont fly. Pretty please??? lol.<br /><br />and as far as that other monsterous beasts, who knows what lives in the bowels of astoria park. Wouldnt be surprised if it had supersized giant grasshoppers down there. EEW. For some reason though I am able to face other critters like spiders, mice, etc.. but waterbugs and roaches.. I just can NOT deal. <br /><br />

				Yes, our local Water Bug/Palmetto&#039;s do fly- they just have to be really PO&#039;d. And it&#039;s more of a jumping flight. Kind of like a chicken. Boric acid under the sink cabinet and similar places the kitties can&#039;t get to is fine. And besides, our little hunters will take care of most that do show up. I sometimes find a wing or two in the morning after they sound like they are fighting each other sometime overnight. the rest of it? I don&#039;t want to know...

				Feel lucky you don&#039;t live near a rooftop garden.&nbsp; When I lived in Manhattan, I lived on the 11th Floor and faced tons of them.&nbsp; Whenever I left the window open, bugs would fly in.&nbsp; Ladybugs were commonly found on my ceiling but I found a few flying waterbugs too.&nbsp; So it seems they do fly high and they like gardens or watered gardens.&nbsp; I usually freaked and killed the waterbugs with the Village Voice.&nbsp; A paper big enough to drown out the crunch&nbsp; :-P

				The BF told me yesterday that he used to get an &quot;outbreak&quot; of ladybugs on his windowsill ever year, and would vacuum them up!&nbsp; :-o<br /><br />I was like, you live right across the street from the Botanical Gardens, just box &#039;em up and release them there!

				I used to have one of these, but I lived upstate at the time and never encountered large bugs.&nbsp; Are you saying that this vacuum works on the giant waterbugs?&nbsp; The ones I see are so large that I can&#039;t imagine this thing having the power to suck them up.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to anger them and make them start flying!&nbsp; <br /><br />Usually I kill them with a shoe (never ever one that I&#039;m wearing) and smash them until I&#039;m positive they&#039;re dead.&nbsp; Then I wait until they dry up a bit before I sweep them up (because I am so, so disgusted).&nbsp; I refuse to EVER walk in my apartment without shoes, because I am so afraid of them!&nbsp; The last time I saw one, though, it was crawling on my cabinet above my sink, and when I killed it, it fell into my sink.&nbsp; I needed my sink, so I scooped it up with a paper plate and I think it had wings..eewwww

				Awesome!

Can&#039;t find the hole they&#039;re coming in from -- our building was built in 1929, there are many holes. I&#039;ve tried glue traps and those other ones that kind of snap around (not the traditional mousetrap, but one where you don&#039;t see the mouse inside). Afraid to try poison, since we&#039;ve got pets and I&#039;m afraid of them getting into it. Oh, and we already have two cats -- neither of which seem interested in doing anything about the intruder.<br /><br />Any thoughts? Cute little guy, but he&#039;s annoying the hell out of me, especially since this little rodents with a brain the size of a raisin is outsmarting me. It&#039;s an ego thing.&nbsp;

				Okay, this may sound a little weird but I recently had a mouse in my house and I went nuts. I can&#039;t stand them and rarely get them. My fiance, God bless him, immediately went out to buy traps. Now I&#039;m not crazy about traps either as I find them cruel. However, given the situation and the fact that I was about to encounter sleepless nights, I had to give in. Well, my mouse, I believe,&nbsp; did pirouettes around the traps (thank God) as I truly didn&#039;t want to see a creature suffer but at the same time, I wanted and needed my peace of mind. (BTW, for those who are about to recommend the little pc traps, they don&#039;t work. I used one many years ago.)<br /><br />So, I went online and purchased Riddex. It&#039;s this box that you plug into an outlet and it has this technology that mice and waterbugs supposedly hate. I admit I was skeptical but I thought I didn&#039;t have much to lose and its safe for pets and children. <br /><br />Guess what guys....no more mouse. No droppings, no evidence of him being around. I recommend you give it a try.<br /><br />

				I just moved into Astoria a couple of weeks ago.&nbsp; The building is old - but thankfully I haven&#039;t seen a single bug - especially no water bugs.&nbsp; &nbsp;My old place had a serious water bug problem. While it was no where near the water, we had excessive humidity from constantly leaking steam pipes and large service basements where the bugs must have thrived.<br /><br />No matter how many times you encounter these creatures, the shock factor never diminishes.&nbsp; However, with so many encounters, one does have the opportunity to prefect extermination techniques.&nbsp; And baring the interesting device which started this post, I&#039;ve tried killing these bastards in a lot of different ways.<br /><br />The two methods I have found most effective are as follows:<br /><br />Using the sticky glue mouse traps - which can catch and kill up to 6 water bugs when placed in an area of known bug traffic.&nbsp; As long as the traps are out of sight (under a sink, couch, or cabinet) you only need get grossed out when you go to throw away the trap and replace it with another.<br /><br />For those face to face encounters I found that a handful of moist paper toweling makes an excellent bug missile.&nbsp; The water makes the paper towel heavy enough to smash the water bugs with.&nbsp; It&nbsp; completely stuns and immobilizes them (sometimes it can kill them instantly if thrown hard enough).&nbsp; Then, simply scoop and flush.<br /><br />But I sure hope I never have to do that gain; I&#039;m looking forward to more peaceful times in my new digs.

				Do you guys live in a swamp? I never see any of these bugs. Really. Maybe we&#039;ll see a cockroach once a year, or a silverfish occasionally, but not waterbugs. Anyway just step on them, and don&#039;t be scared of them, they can&#039;t bite you. Disgusting, yes. Venomous, no.

				http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mX1Au4D7buE (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mX1Au4D7buE)<br /><br />Dude. You would have to kill me. A friend of mine went to Hawaii for her culinary internship and ended up staying in a house located smack in the middle of a sugarcane field during harvest time. These cane spiders (usually about 4 inches wide or larger) totally infested her house. (This isn&#039;t her footage, though.) She said her worst experience with these monstrous creatures was in the middle of night as she reached for the roll of bath tissue. Holy. Crap. It ran across her hand, fell onto the floor, and ran across her feet. Like one of the comments on this video, a frying pan was really the only instrument large enough to dispatch the nightmarish beasts. She lasted three weeks in that house before nearly losing her mind. I would have lasted all of three seconds. They&#039;re not quick to bite, and even if you did get bitten (horror of horrors) I don&#039;t believe they&#039;re poisonous, so there&#039;s an upside. This waterbug discussion got me wondering which critters I could tolerate less: giant flying disgusting waterbugs/roaches, or Potter-esque hugantic spiders. It&#039;s a tough one. Fortunately, we&#039;re very lucky bug-wise in our apartment. The worst pests we have to contend with are our neighbors.<br /><br />Wasn&#039;t particularly thrilled by the weird littler bug the spider was chasing.&nbsp; Shudder!!&nbsp; Shudder!!&nbsp; Too many bugs in the kitchen!!!<br /><br />Ditto on the mantises. They were my favorite bug when I was a kid. We would get a lot of them on our plants. Totally frickin&#039; awesome bugs. Their faces are like little alien faces.&nbsp; :smitten:

Given the size of the waterbugs I&#039;ve seen, and given the size of those house centipedes, I think you&#039;d need a swarm of like a dozen of the centipedes to take down a waterbug! And, honestly, that&#039;s several orders of magnitude too many little legs for me to be happy with...!

				<br />Most embarrasing water bug moment,&nbsp; I was showing a room for rent to a potential roommate,&nbsp; I opened the door and we went in and out comes a huge WB from under the bed, I was mortified, he&#039;s like &quot; do you have bugs here, I do not live with bugs&quot;&nbsp; I swore that was the first time I ever saw one, lol, he did rent the room but he was always on WB alert, and yes the cats do help, they LOVE to catch and play with them,

You might have to go a lil more remote than Siberia. Siberia= forests= all sorts of spiders, beetles, hoppping things....&nbsp; They do have quite a lot of pretty dragonflies though. Are there insects in Antartica?

				I agree that this thread always makes my skin crawl and I STILL keep reading it.<br /><br />Question about something a friend told me that I hope is not true.. she said that when you smash a waterbug, you spread its eggs out on the floor and it multiplies?&nbsp; I&#039;m hoping that she is just misinformed.&nbsp; Especially because after I smash one on the floor, I am so horrified that for awhile I just put a shoe over it until I&#039;m sure it won&#039;t be moving anymore and it dries up a little bit.<br />
