				If you are looking to get published there is a great magazine called JPG.&nbsp; They have three themes each issue that come up (although there are a ton more themes that you can submit to even before they come up for issue).&nbsp; Once you submit for a theme people can vote on your picture and how well it suits that theme.&nbsp; You can vote as well on yours and everyone elses.&nbsp; It&#039;s also a good way to look at some really good photography (and some not so good&nbsp; :-()&nbsp; When the themes are closed the editors take into account the voting but they eventually pick what will go in the magazine for that theme.&nbsp; I have an issue of this magazine and it&#039;s a gorgeous art magazine printed on thick paper stock.<br />I have been submitting and i highly recommend it.<br /><strong>http://www.jpgmag.com/</strong><br />

				Yes, JPG is a great magazine.&#160; They use to have a group on Flickr, wherein they would canvas submitted images, though they have since abandoned Flickr in order to concerntrate more on the magazine as a whole.

				I luuuuuuuurve JPG, and have for a long time. Heather &amp; Derek rule.<br /><br />Not sure if they really &quot;abandoned&quot; Flickr, maybe it had to do with Yahoo buying Flickr out? (I think they/Heather still work there.) Again, I&#039;m really not sure, feel free to correct me :)
