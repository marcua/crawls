			I&#39;m a big sports nut, and would LOVE for Astorians.com to have a category (or even a subcategory) just devoted to sports.&nbsp; Right now the Mets and Yanks are in first place, fantasy football is starting up, and we just went through one of the most entertaining world cups ever.&nbsp; I&#39;m sure other sports-minded guys and gals would love to have a section devoted purely to this topic where they can celebrate (or cry) about their fave teams (local or otherwise)<br /><br />It can also be used to set up games among the community (softball, ultimate frisbee, touch football, heck even poker, bowling, or darts) <br /><br />Thanks!<br />-Rob<br /><br />

			I&#39;m keeping an eye on this thread. If there&#39;s continued interest (among others) we may add it.<br /><br />Sounds like it could be cool.

			I&#39;m also curious as to whether or not there&#39;s a way to include sports but broaden the topic a bit.<br /><br />Like what else goes with sports?<br /><br />Sports &amp; Games, Gaming -- including WoW, football, poker, frisbee, running<br /><br />I think just sports might be a little too narrow.&nbsp; But I&#39;m also not a sports geek.<br /><br /><br /><br />cheers,<br />jayme<br />
