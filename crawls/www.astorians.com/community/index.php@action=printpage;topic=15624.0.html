				We don&#039;t have that great luck in Astoria with Asian or South Asian restaurants besides Thai places, and maybe Seva, but I&#039;m very hopeful about Spiced, on Ditmars near 34th St.&nbsp; I had a really good lunch there today, with some good hot &amp; sour soup (yes! - in Astoria!), and good Chili Tofu.<br /><br />No doubt their non-vegetarian food is really their specialty, like Chicken Lollipops, etc.&nbsp; I&#039;ll be interested to hear from other people!<br /><br />Oh, they&#039;re having a major special discount for their grand opening right now.&nbsp; They barely charged me for my food...

				35-12 Ditmars (the spot that used to be East Moon).&nbsp; Don&#039;t know if they have a website up, they were handing out photocopied delivery menus out front but they don&#039;t have a URL on them.&nbsp; Phone is 718-626-8180.<br /><br />I&#039;m hoping to check them out sometime this week.&nbsp; Anything has got to be better than East Moon!

				Thanks xopchipili - I shoulda given that info.&nbsp; I got a copy of the take-out menu too, and now I see why my lunch was so cheap.&nbsp; They&#039;ve got a 20% off grand opening special going on, and their lunch specials are $5.95 for soup, rice and entree.

				Absolutely.&nbsp; I tried out it&#039;s predecessor in that location, East Moon, which just wasn&#039;t good.&nbsp; I&#039;ve only had one meal at Spiced, with two vegetarian dishes, so my experience is limited.&nbsp; Based on that, though, I&#039;m definitely going back.&nbsp; The soup was really good, and the entree was okay to good.&nbsp; I suspect a more full assessment of the place would have to be made by meat and seafood eaters.&nbsp; Here&#039;s some information about this cuisine:<br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Chinese_cuisine<br /><br />I like food spicy, and it was fairly spicy - not often the case.&nbsp; For those who prefer mildly spiced food, I think it would make sense to tell them that for guidance when you&#039;re ordering.<br /><br />The place is also quite comfortable, although the music was a little louder than I would prefer myself.&nbsp; Seems like the case in lots of Astoria restaurants.&nbsp; I&#039;d be comfortable asking for the volume to be turned down a little if necessary next time.&nbsp; The staff was extremely pleasant and attentive, concerned that I was happy with my food, and pleased when I said that I was.

				I really wanted to like this place..and I always try to be sympathetic to restaurants having off days, but went there the other day, and the food was really really not good and I didnt care much for the ambiance either.&nbsp; I know that sounds snotty, but it seems they did put some sort of effort in the ambiance and I can see what they are trying to achieve, but it came off cheesey to me. Maybe they needed to dim the lights a little, I dont know. And dont get me wrong, some of the best food in the world is in the diviest of places, but its just a shame because it does seem that they did try and put quite a bit of effort into decor.. I think a lot of it can be fixed with some dimmer lights. <br /><br />Im thinking the problem is they opened too early before they were really ready.&nbsp; The bar wasnt set up yet. The shelves were bare. There was a few rolls of bounty paper towells behind the bar.&nbsp; The back was still being constructed.&nbsp; The staff was very friendly, though seemed inexperienced.&nbsp; The workers were all very nice.&nbsp; We ordered the basil ginger chicken and the crab fried rice and it actually tasted like one of those frozen asian inspired entrees you get in the frozen section at the supermarket. The crab fried rice was also a bummer. I couldnt help but to think I could have done better in my own kitchen.&nbsp; They have a pretty large selection, and I cant help but to think for now maybe they should perhaps find a few dishes, do them REALLY WELL, then maybe try to expand. <br /><br />I was really bummed. Maybe once they are all set up it will be great, but for now, to survive here, they need to do better than that. <br /><br />

				I tried Spiced last Friday evening.&nbsp; When my office was at 28th &amp; Madison, I had many lunches at Chinese Mirch, one of the first &quot;Indian Chinese&quot; restaurants in the city.&nbsp; I&#039;ve missed their food ever since, and I was glad to see Indian Chinese food come to Astoria.<br /><br />Fortunately, I had a wholly positive experience at Spiced.&nbsp; The ambiance seemed fine to me, low-key, a little bit designer-y, not bad.&nbsp; The lights were fairly dim during my visit.&nbsp; The service was attentive; maybe a little too attentive, but I prefer that to aloof service.<br /><br />The food, I thought, was excellent.&nbsp; I note that bejessie ordered Thai items and was disappointed; it may be that Thai simply isn&#039;t their strength.&nbsp; I stuck to the Chinese dishes and was very pleased.&nbsp; The food was truly spicy--NOT palate-scorching a la Szechuan Gourmet, but definitely hot and spicy.&nbsp; (None of the menu items is marked spicy, so be forewarned if you&#039;re not accustomed to Indian-style Chinese--ask your server).&nbsp; <br /><br />The Manchow soup had complex flavor and tender shredded vegetables.&nbsp; The Chicken Manchurian would have been better with white meat chicken; nevertheless, it was beyond delicious, bathed in that incredibly addictive silky sauce.&nbsp; The fresh lime soda was incredibly refreshing but, I thought, a bit too expensive.&nbsp; Still, with their 20%-off grand opening special, I wasn&#039;t worrying about it.<br /><br />Next time I&#039;ll try their chili chicken with gravy, crabmeat-corn soup and, maybe, one of their desserts.&nbsp; I&#039;m really happy to have this place in Astoria, and I hope those who enjoy spicy food will try it.<br /><br />(a note about &quot;Indian chinese&quot; cuisine for the uninitiated: it&#039;s not some kind of hybrid of Indian food and Chinese food, it&#039;s Chinese food as adapted to an Indian palate.&nbsp; So the dishes look and taste distinctively Chinese, but they include Indian spices and basmati rice, and one vegetarian dish includes paneer.&nbsp; But don&#039;t go expecting Indian curries or the like.)<br /><br />

				We just had a chance to try this place (ate in).&nbsp; I have to say, we really liked the whole experience.&nbsp; It&#039;s true about the decor.&nbsp; It reminds me a little of Bungalo on Broadway.&nbsp; It&#039;s more loungy than your average restaurant.&nbsp; But we liked it.&nbsp; It&#039;s modern, colorful and cheery.&nbsp; We tried quite a few dishes.&nbsp; The Rocket Shrimp, the Honey Chili Tofu (both are fried appetizers) and a Sweet Corn Soup with crab meat.&nbsp; (You can get chicken, crab or veggie).&nbsp; Also the fried calamari.&nbsp; All were very good.&nbsp; The tofu is about the best fried tofu we&#039;ve had anywhere.&nbsp; Super crispy and the hot chili with the honey was perfect.&nbsp; The calamari and shrimp were heavily panko crusted.&nbsp; I&nbsp; didn&#039;t have a problem with it though.&nbsp; Not like a heavy batter - and not oily.&nbsp; Just very crunchy.&nbsp; The soup was great and not skimpy on the crab.&nbsp; And real crab meat - with the subtle flavor of corn.&nbsp; Not a sweet creamed corn soup, which I almost expected.&nbsp; It was more like an eggdrop with corn and crab.&nbsp; Entree choices at our table were a Chinese style shelled lobster dish.&nbsp; Can&#039;t recall which one out of three or so on the menu.&nbsp; It was like a General Tso&#039;s Lobster, if I had to describe it.&nbsp; Chunks of lobster battered, fried and then in a heavy, sweetish sauce.&nbsp; It was good but not great.&nbsp; We would probably not go for the lobster dishes again (do that at Nuevo Jardin de China on Broadway).&nbsp; I had the Crab Moo Shu.&nbsp; And here comes the minor complaint.&nbsp; I asked the waitress (who was extremely polite, friendly, and attentive) about the dishes.&nbsp; She was completely unfamiliar about the way in which several menu items were prepared.&nbsp; I explained that I was not a fan of onions being a main ingredient.&nbsp; So without any warning, out comes my Moo Shu - a virtual bushel of sauteed onions on the plate.&nbsp; Along with the crab.&nbsp; In fact, outside of red and white onions, and scallions, there were no other ingredients besides the crab.&nbsp; In my mind, being used to a heavily cabbaged Moo Shu, perhaps both the menu and the wait staff should warn of this heavy onion use.&nbsp; But enough of that.&nbsp; I have to say that once I got the onions off to the side, this dish was amazing.&nbsp; I loved the hot spiciness of it.&nbsp; The crab meat was moist and delicious.&nbsp; I would highly recommend this dish.&nbsp; I spoke with them and they can do it without onions.&nbsp; But be warned.&nbsp; It&#039;s hot.&nbsp; And the whole thing comes in a huge fried Chinese noodle bowl.&nbsp; Someone else at a nearby table ordered it as well and gasped at the spiciness and sent it back.&nbsp; I thought to myself, the sign outside says SPICED - what were you expecting?&nbsp; I really look forward to going back to this place.&nbsp; The only things I think could use improvement would be the menu descriptions.&nbsp; They need more about the ingredients and spicyness levels.&nbsp; And they should give a &quot;tour&quot; of the menu, and even a tasting menu of the real dishes, to all the waiters.&nbsp; There&#039;s no better way for them to be able to describe the items than if they actually see each dish&nbsp; - and even taste them if they can and want.

				I tried this place a number of times and I think it&#039;s pretty good.&nbsp; I feel like it&#039;s better than Chinese Mirch in Manhattan.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t been able to find an Indian Chinese place in the States that matches the awesome Indian Chinese I had in India but Spiced kind of makes me reminisce.&nbsp; And it&#039;s great to have a place like this in Astoria.<br /><br />I really have to try Tangra Masala.&nbsp; Heard a lot of great things about it.&nbsp; I hope I can soon say that this place is the best Indian Chinese in NY.

				I&#039;ve only gotten takeout from here and it was a couple of nonspicy dishes, so I can&#039;t speak to the interior decor or the spiciness of the food. One of the dishes was ordinary fried rice and, while it was pretty much your standard fried rice, the fact that it was made with basmati rice made it more interesting than usual. I&#039;ll be going back to try more (I&#039;d never tried this particular fusion before). Also, I agree with everyone who says it&#039;s a much welcomed upgrade from East Moon.

				Was just there this afternoon and really enjoyed the food.&nbsp; Fave dishes were the appetizer &quot;Chicken 911&quot; (in part because of the name) and the main Coriander Fish (tilapia).&nbsp; The &quot;Spiced&quot; Triple Szechwan noodles were great (loved the fried egg on top), and the Chicken Manchurian was really nice.&nbsp; The fresh lime drink was delicious and refreshing - lime, sugar and club soda, well balanced.&nbsp; <br /><br />I could have had it spicier, but it was fine as it was.&nbsp; I guess I like more spicy than I let on.&nbsp; However, the <em>taste</em> of the spice was really good.&nbsp; I do enjoy that.<br /><br />Decor was not as cheezy as I thought it would be.&nbsp; My favorite decorative item was the mirrored &quot;decapus&quot; on the back wall, and I also liked the hanging colored lights over the register area.<br /><br />I&#039;ll be back for sure.

				went to spiced last friday, it was packed, slow service but good. we were originally planning to go to green curry across the street but then i saw the bright purple trees and looked inside, saw that it was full while green curry was empty, i got a little concerned and convinced the fellows to go across the street insted. we were a little disappointed because there was no alchohol ( its a new restaurant and no liquor license) but the fresh lime sodas did it for us, it was really really refreshing. though atfirst i thought that the drinks were too expensive but when i looked at the entree prices i realized it was only fair since they were barely charging us anything for the food. the fried chili lamb was one of the best dishes i ever had and it only cost me 9.99!!!&nbsp; the chicken lolipop appetizer was the coolest thing ever (chicken wings that is shaped like lolipops) and it was soo damn good. if anybody ever goes to spiced they must try the chicken lolipop!!! another really cool starter was the &quot;spiced&quot; sticks. it was huge and, again, cheap and tasty!!! we never really had such dishes anywhere else and i doubt u can actually find them in any other restaurant. definitely going back there over and over again.

				MR. OLIVER,<br /><br />i have had indian chinese in almost every indian chinese restaurant in nyc... tangra, tangra masala, tangra wok, chinese mirch, nanking, etc. and SPICED really doesnt need to be compaired, they r truly the best at this cuisine. im glad they opened up because they come closest to the real thing. their chef must really know what hes cooking... you should try for your self, if you really liked tangra masala that much i know you will love spiced... <br />

				I have now repeated the order 5+ times, so I feel more confident publicly disclosing this:&nbsp; I am in love with the hot and sour soup at SPICED.&nbsp; There&#039;s a world of mediocre hot and sour soup out there, and I&#039;m amazed that my favorite of all I&#039;ve tried in NYC is up Ditmars a few blocks from my house.<br /><br />

				This is a mixed review.&nbsp; I love this place.&nbsp; We&#039;ve been ordering and going there to eat rather often from the start of their business.&nbsp; But there has been some inconsistency with the food that has been almost jarring.&nbsp; I often get the same dish every time (among other things).&nbsp; In this case, the Moo Shoo Crab.&nbsp; Sometimes it&#039;s really hot and spicy.&nbsp; Other times very mild.&nbsp; Sometimes loaded with onions.&nbsp; Sometimes loaded with cabbage, no onions.&nbsp; Sometimes neither and just a spicy lump of crab.&nbsp; So we finally started talking to them some more.&nbsp; There has been a chef change.&nbsp; So the new chef is trying to learn the ropes and get a groove.&nbsp; Which is a shame.&nbsp; They seem to have a hard time delivering on brown rice when you request it instead of white.&nbsp; And they are sadly giving the impression that business isn&#039;t exactly booming.&nbsp; So the future may not look so good for them.&nbsp; I think this is a shame.&nbsp; Spiced stands out in my mind as a restaurant that could really have a stronghold if they&#039;d just get their act together a bit.&nbsp; The menu is unique (I think) for the Ditmars area.&nbsp; I love the Spicy Fish and the Fried Chili Lamb.&nbsp; And the partner/owner we spoke with is truly concerned that the customers are pleased, and they seem to be trying the best they can.&nbsp; But obviously what goes on in the kitchen needs some work.&nbsp; But I hope they don&#039;t fail.&nbsp; I would really miss their food.

				I agree, TJT.&nbsp; We had a bad experience with the food last Sunday when we ordered delivery.&nbsp; We ordered stuff we had many times before and it was surprising that they messed up really simple things (like how both of the appetizers we ordered weren&#039;t fried long enough to cook the inside properly).&nbsp; The Spiced soup, which is also something we enjoyed before was completely inedible this time.&nbsp; We had to throw out most of our food since a lot of it was undercooked.&nbsp; We were so disappointed that we thought this would be the last delivery we get from them.&nbsp; <br /><br />Spiced changing their chef explains a lot of what happened with our order.&nbsp; I like having an Indian-Chinese place in Astoria.&nbsp; It&#039;s unfortunate that they can&#039;t seem to make their food and service consistent.&nbsp;

				Snowball, since you described your experience, I will go on to say that we had quite a detailed conversation about the whole thing with the owner.&nbsp; They are well aware that they almost lost us as a customer forever.&nbsp; And they really cared.&nbsp; They even insisted on resending some items to us (our original order was a walk in and take out order - so there was some face to face interplay beforehand).&nbsp; And then they called us about 45 minutes later to get our opinion on the second delivery.&nbsp; I thought that showed genuine concern.&nbsp; I also threw out the Spiced Soup, which I love.&nbsp; It was loaded with so much inedible lemon grass that it was like eating a tree.&nbsp; As much as I appreciate their thoughtfulness, if this new chef doesn&#039;t improve almost immediately, we won&#039;t go back again.&nbsp; Who would?&nbsp; The original chef went to China for a family emergency.&nbsp; Don&#039;t know if he&#039;ll be back or if this is going to take time to work out.

				I&#039;m forced to revise my earlier reports on Spiced.&nbsp; I&#039;m afraid the impact of a change in chef seems to have affected the food - at least the hot &amp; sour soup which had been excellent, is now just over-salty and blah.&nbsp; My hubby liked their chicken lollipops and chili garlic chicken this weekend, but my honey chili tofu wasn&#039;t as good as before (though it may have suffered from enclosure during delivery) and the chili tofu entree was sort of a salty gelatinous, under-tofu-ed, mess.<br /><br />I&#039;m hoping this was just a blip.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to see the place succeed (and be good).

				Finally tried Spiced for the first time last night. Overall, we weren&#039;t too impressed. My husband and I each got soup to start - I with the corn soup with crab and he the Spiced soup with shrimp. My soup had very subtle flavors, but I enjoyed it. His soup, on the other hand, was full of flavor and he really liked it - a sweet and sour flavor that balanced well with the cilantro they mounded on top. Then I ordered the chicken szechwan. After the waitress made a point of warning me about its spice level, I expected to receive a dish full of flavor and spice. Not so. It was. . . bland. Pretty much lacking any flavor and the spice was nonexistent. Also, barely any chicken was present in the dish - almost the entire thing was vegetables and it was stingy on the sauce. I was really disappointed. My husband ordered the chicken manchurian and his also came out weak (even though both of these dishes are rated amongst their most spicy) and mostly bland. His had slightly more flavor than mine, but he also ended the meal disappointed. Overall, his soup was the highlight of the meal and everything else was so-so. We may go back and try different dishes, but with all the other fantastic dining options here it won&#039;t be any time soon.

				I had to revive this after giving this place another shot over the weekend.&nbsp; I noticed it was still hanging on and that people were inside.&nbsp; We went in to place a take out order.&nbsp; It seems to me that the people have changed and the menu has gone much more Indian than before.&nbsp; The interior is exactly the same.&nbsp; So we ordered several items, mostly traditional Indian.&nbsp; We came back and the order was neatly wrapped and ready to go.&nbsp; The woman who took our order was very pleasant and professional.&nbsp; I ordered the Fried Chili Lamb.&nbsp; It is super hot and very tasty.&nbsp; Really enjoyed it.&nbsp; The Cauliflower Manchurian was simple but delicious.&nbsp; Shrimp in coconut milk was very good.&nbsp; Shrimps were large, fresh, and cooked perfectly.&nbsp; The Palak Panir was also very good.&nbsp; I&#039;m glad we tried again.&nbsp; It still seems a little on the fringe but something has changed for the better.&nbsp; I know everyone loves Seva.&nbsp; But if you live in the Ditmars area and you like Indian, give it another shot.&nbsp; They still have Thai and Chinese Items as well.&nbsp; But it seems that Indian is where their strength is.

				Thanks for the update, TJT.&nbsp; I had noticed the menu seemed to be more Indian but hadn&#039;t gotten around to trying them again.&nbsp; Seva does deliver to us through Seamless Web, but we don&#039;t often do it because it&#039;s so far.&nbsp; We will have to give them another try.&nbsp; I&#039;d love to have at least a reliable Indian option around Ditmars (I know there&#039;s Prince, which we haven&#039;t gotten around to trying either, but that&#039;s more steam table and I&#039;d also like a freshly prepared option).

				Try it Lanseaux and report back.&nbsp; I think you will be pleasantly surprised.&nbsp; I was.&nbsp; And now very happy to have them back on my restaurant list.&nbsp; But beware that the items they mark as &quot;spicy&quot; are really very hot.&nbsp; I was fine with it but just know that.&nbsp; And I agree on not comparing this to Prince.&nbsp; We did try Prince and will never even go in there again.&nbsp; No reason to say more.&nbsp; Next time we go to Spiced I will try some of the Chinese and Thai items to see what&#039;s happening with that.&nbsp; But I think the Indian is very good.

				Thanks so much for the tip about Spiced! I&#039;d tried them once and found the Indian pretty weak, but we&#039;ll give them another shot. I&#039;m very glad that they&#039;re responding to consumer demand and shifting towards Indian; much as I love Thai, we&#039;ve got plenty of options there.<br /><br />We only order from Seva when we&#039;re willing to wait (or pick it up), but the last time we did (on a Friday night around 6:30) the food was here in about 30 minutes. And we&#039;re all the way up past 21st Avenue! That malai kofta is just sinfully good.<br /><br />We also just tried Lucky, which delivers via SeamlessWeb even though it&#039;s *really* far away. Took a really long time but the food was pretty good and very cheap. They left out a few items initially but delivered them later on (and I&#039;m glad they did -- I ate the leftover $1 samosas for lunch for the next three days...)

				I gave Spiced a try for lunch today.&#160; I ordered through Seamless Web, and after some deliberation, chose the &quot;Indian Prefix [sic] Lunch Special&quot; with mixed vegetable pakora, chicken saag, pilaf rice, and Coke [which I forgot was part of the order and didn&#039;t come anyway, which is good since I don&#039;t drink soda]; the &quot;chicken 911&quot; appetizer (which I think is a smaller version of their chili chicken entree (dry)); and a butter naan.<br /><br />Short verdict: there was nothing wrong with the food itself - I enjoyed it generally, but it was definitely lacking the complexity of a good Indian restaurant.&#160; The lunch special, I am well aware, may not be the best test of a restaurant, but I&#039;ve ordered lunch specials from many Indian restaurants and this didn&#039;t come close.&#160; The vegetable pakora was tasty (but had no dipping sauce, which I wanted - a coriander or tamarind sauce would have been nice, or even some raita), but had a certain blandness, and the chicken saag was the same.&#160; The chicken itself was dark meat (good in my book) and very tender, but it was just lacking in some of the spices (not heat spices but general) I appreciate in good Indian food.&#160; There was nothing pilaf at all about the rice - it was plain white rice, somewhere between Chinese takeout rice and plain Indian rice.&#160; The chicken 911 was good - the dry chili chicken was one of my favourite dishes at Spiced when they first opened, and it seemed about the same.&#160; The naan was good.<br /><br />I am by no means writing them off, and I have definite plans to order the fried chili lamb (I came thisclose to ordering it today) as well as a few other items on the menu.&#160; At the very least, it may be a good option to have nearby for those times when I am just craving Indian food and can&#039;t wait and don&#039;t have time to cook it myself.

				I&#039;m glad you tried it and gave an thorough review.&nbsp; I get the impression that it&#039;s the whole fusion thing that has plagued them from the start.&nbsp; Maybe if they went full out Indian, they wouldn&#039;t do things like giving out Chinese white rice.&nbsp; But I agree with you.&nbsp; We tend to rotate our shopping between different parts of Astoria.&nbsp; But when we are on Ditmars, we will definitely give them a shot.&nbsp; At least for this Fried Chili Lamb, which I really loved - and is unique to them.&nbsp; But I agree, I wouldn&#039;t call it a top pick.&nbsp; But maybe they are on their way to getting their act together even more.&nbsp; I hope they continue to improve.&nbsp; And maybe eventually change the 80s disco interior!

				I frequented this place when it first opened and absolutely loved it.&nbsp; I only ordered the Chinese dishes because I&#039;d fallen in love with Indian Chinese cuisine while working in Curry Hill.&nbsp; After a while I went less frequently because I got too lazy to walk to Ditmars, and then I rationalized it when reviews started appearing here saying they&#039;d changed and were off their game.<br /><br />I went back several weeks ago, again only ordering Chinese dishes, and found that while the food was a little different, it was still very good--at least to my tastes.&nbsp; Since then I&#039;m a regular again.<br /><br />Regarding the Indian or Thai dishes, I can&#039;t comment.&nbsp; I get my fill of Thai and Indian food elsewhere.&nbsp; This is strictly a comment on their Chinese food, and, of course, it&#039;s Indian-style Chinese so if you don&#039;t like that variant, you won&#039;t like Spiced.

				For wine and beer - and excellent offerings, at that - give Crescent and Vine on Ditmars a try. We had a couple of delicious Belgian beers there the other night. And Mosaic on 24th Ave is another great spot for relaxing with a drink. Their nibbly foods are also tasty.

				I enjoy Crescent and Vine very much, and Mosaic too although it&#039;s further from here than Sparrow. I think most can agree that a good bar/gastropub type place would do well up here. There&#039;s really not a great place to meet for a nice round within 5-7 blocks of Spiced.

It was a good experience.<br /><br /><br />The new bar on 23rd Ave looks kind of creepy inside. I do not get a good vibe from it at all.<br />&nbsp;<br />Did the bar on 23rd Ave. open yet?<br /><br /><br />BTW, the backyard at Mojave is amazing. One of the nicest backyard patios in Astoria.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
