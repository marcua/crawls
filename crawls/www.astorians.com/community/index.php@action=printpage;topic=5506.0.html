				There are many, but be careful of their financials.&nbsp; After looking at 3 different co-ops, and what we could get, we decided on just buying a house (so excited) and expect to close by mid April.&nbsp; The problem we kept seeing were deficit spending in the last few years, and needing an extra maintenance allocation to prevent additional deficit spending.&nbsp; I know Boulevard Gardens (technically woodside) is good, but tough to get into (my fiance&#039;s mom lives there so they wouldn&#039;t let us in as well).

				I think that you would generally want to see a co-op that has a good amount of money in the reserve fund; how much would depend on the size of the co-op. You would also want to know about the underlying mortgage on the co-op as well. Before you buy a co-op, you would get a copy of their finances that I would strongly advise you have a real estate attorney review.

				Unfortunately, there are very few 2 BDRS in 44-14 Newtown Road, and there are none for sale in the near future or in the horizon. People hold on to those 2 bdrms or pass them on to family.

				Maintenance charges can go up because of plenty of other things other than people defaulting on their apartments. Oil for one was very expensive last year, the cost of inflation, expenses on the building for major fixes, the list can go on, and I&#039;m sure someone will be happy to enumerate them for us.<br /><br />There are pros and cons to LIFE. If you don&#039;t want to live and take risks, then we can choose to live in our own holes underground and never come out...there is no sure thing in life anywhere, not in real-estate, not with pets, children, husbands, wives, careers, etc...

				Real estate prices, like the prices of everything else, never truly go down. <br />-------------------------------------------------<br /><br />True because of INFLATION..........a $90K house in park slope should be worth MAX $135-150K today.&nbsp; If you use the standard 3x average yearly income.....which has been the standard in America for well over 100 years until this zero down neg-am&nbsp; crapola of the last few years.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />So either wages must go up 50% or inflation OR ELSE YOU GET STUCK IN YOUR HOMES FOR THE NEXT 20 YEARS........&nbsp; &nbsp;either way not very many good options.
