				<br />I saw that a new Green Bay organic market is in the process of being built on 30th Ave (I think it was around 32nd Street maybe?).&nbsp; Like their Bway market, it will be open 24 hours.&nbsp; It&#039;s a nice market, but a bit pricey if I recall from their Bway market...

				This is great.&nbsp; I like Green Bay.&nbsp; The Key Food on 30th is pretty good but for people that need or want specialty items, organic, gluten free, etc., Green Bay is a nice store and a nicer shopping experience.&nbsp; A few bucks more but worth it.&nbsp; I hope Ditmars is next.&nbsp; I don&#039;t like that Natural Frontier Market at all.

				<br />I love Natural Frontier.&nbsp; What don&#039;t you like about it?<br /><br />I also loved Sai Organics when I lived near 30th Ave., but now it&#039;s pretty rare I get there since I&#039;m up by Ditmars now.

				I love Green Bay. It is on the pricey side but you get what you pay for. I &#039;m excited about the new market on 30th Ave.

				People incorrectly assume Green Bay is a health food store because it says ORGANIC on the awning. It is not. It does have some organic produce, packaged foods, etc, but not much more than a typical supermarket has today. It has a lot of pricier snack foods.&nbsp; It&#039;s more of a higher end gourmet grocery.

				True. It is definitely a gourmet market, not a health food store.
