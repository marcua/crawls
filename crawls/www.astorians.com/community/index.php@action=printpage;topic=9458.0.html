Mr. Obama did oppose immunity on a key earlier motion to end debate. Mrs. Clinton, campaigning in Texas, issued a statement saying she would have voted to oppose the final measure.&quot;<br /><br />So, Dodd frames the issue correctly, recognizes what is at stake, and mounts a serious effort to oppose it. But Obama and Clinton were missing in action. F--- them!!!&nbsp; And, of course, McCain did manage to vote for this law, which ought to provoke the press to ask him, &quot;Excuse us, Senator, but why are you eviscerating the Constitution that soldiers are presumably sworn to defend?&quot; McCain, what an ass. <br /><br />But Obama and Clinton are supposed to be the kinds of leaders who want to protect our civil liberties, right? And with a Democratically controlled Sentate, and with all of the press focusing on them, one or both of them could have drawn national attention to this issue and maybe even turned the tide against this law. But not only did they not fight it, <strong>Obama and Clinton didn&#039;t even vote.</strong> SHAME ON THEM! <br /><br />So we live in a world where, when Republicans control Congress they push through massive expansions of fiscally irresponsible entitlement programs and corporate welfare, and when Democrats control Congress they rubber-stamp laws that immunize corporations from lawsuits arising from their assistance in violating civil liberties of people being wiretapped by the State without warrants. <br /><br />Nightmarish.<br /><br />I repeat: it is not republicans versus democrats, it&#039;s professional politicians versus citizens, versus you and me.

				Yeah, I was very disappointed when I read this yesterday.&nbsp; And it&#039;s not being reported on or talked about much on the news.&nbsp; I understand Obama and Clinton not being able to make a vote since they are actively campaigning, but to not even make a public condemnation of the issue is disheartening to say the least.&nbsp; &nbsp;

It&#039;s one of the reasons I can&#039;t watch American news outlets anymore. How could they not report this?<br />But I think that since Obama and Clinton still have jobs to do, they should still do them regardless if they are campaigning to basically get a different job. If one of them went back to vote against the measure and said so publicly it may have helped their campaign. You know show the voters that they are still committed to the job they already have. The fact that they can&#039;t do this doesn&#039;t instill much faith in me for either of them as president. But either of them is preferrable to McCain. At least he did his job. I may not agree with his decision to go along with his, but at least he went back and voted.

				To be fair, Obama missed out on the final passage vote and the first two amendment votes on Feb 7th (none of the canidates were there that day), but he did vote for every amendment to lessen its impact (and every amendment was defeated) and voted against cloture.<br /><br />Hillary couldn&#039;t be bothered to show despite being in DC at the time.

				Warrantless wiretapping? Nightmarish. <br />Immunizing corporations that comply with government trespasses against citizens&#039; individual liberties? Nightmarish. <br /><br />This government didn&#039;t need these powers to prevent 9/11 from happening. They had the intelligence they needed. There were even rules against passengers paying in cash for one-way tickets at the gate which should have prevented the evilmeanies from getting on the planes the way they did. <br /><br />I&#039;m not opposed to wiretapping. Just to the process whereby it happens in lieu of any checks and balances designed to ensure that our government, which is only instituted to protect individual liberty, remains limited by that principle. I would understand if logistical changes need to be made to accelerate a review of wiretapping requests. But there&#039;s still a correct order; warrants should be granted before not after wiretapping commences.

				Still, I think this vote is a big deal, and the issue should have been commented upon by both Obama and Clinton.&nbsp; They should make a big deal out of it, but I have to wonder if it will take us pushing them for them to say anything publicly right now.

				Man, why would someone neg nod me for asking a question? I agree with Adam on the principle that government exist to protect to individual liberties, but this only applies to citizens (and residents) of this country.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The bill, which had the strong backing of the White House, allows the government to eavesdrop on large bundles of foreign-based communications on its own authority so long as Americans are not the targets. A secret intelligence court, which traditionally has issued individual warrants before wiretapping began, would review the procedures set up by the executive branch only after the fact to determine whether there were abuses involving Americans. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>This seems to be the money quote on the eavesdropping issue. It is far more complicated than the issue of warrantless eavesdropping. The technology that exists today makes the laws that were passed a decade ago obsolete. So they need to be updated. So our elected officials need to sit down and figure out the best way to do it.&nbsp; If this doesn&#039;t work try something different.<br />The government does far more intrusive things on a day to day basis than wiretapping. Troubling perhaps, nightmarish ...eh.

				Good point sweeper.&nbsp; I pos-nodded you back to even.<br /><br />Its nightmarish to me because its just another part of this country which is steamrolling to a police state.&nbsp; Its nightmareish that the gov&#039;t is pushing it on us, its nightmarish that a loyal opposition isn&#039;t opposing this and its nightmarish that we citizens are rather indifferent to it.<br /><br />And its even more nightmarish that you are probably right about the man doing far more intrusive things.

				sweeper and daisy have been negative-nodded, as of 12:27 on my computer, and I find it mystifying and upsetting.

				Without an oversight by a FISA court judge, even after the fact, domestic spying on telecommunications are subject to abuses. The main reason isn&#039;t that we don&#039;t want surveillance on potential suspects, but because there is already some evidence that abuses have already occured, and absolving the telecommunication companies of breaking the law retrospectively is simply condoning illegal activity. <br /><br />I can&#039;t begin to describe how terribly disappointed I am at this congress, not just for not standing up and setting an agenda for protecting our consitutional rights, but for repeatedly passing Bush bills that undermine our rights. Both Clinton and Obama show they didn&#039;t think this was important enough vote to even show up for. I was planning on voting for Obama for president after Edwards suspended his run, now I wonder if I even have a viable candidate I feel I can vote for. <br /><br />Shame on all of them. :x

We all know he has charisma. We all find his rhetorical style classy and engaging. But, you know, he&#039;s a millionaire with a six figure income from a job that simply requires him to VOTE. To show up, take a stand for his constituents, uphold the Constitution, BY VOTING.&nbsp; <br /><br />Not voting is inexcusable. <br /><br />Busy on the campaign trail? Bullsh_t. He should have made it part of his campaign. He could have said, &quot;I&#039;m going to talk to you tonight at this rally via satellite, because I&#039;m here in DC fighting for your freedoms. &lt;crowd goes wild&gt;. I&#039;m not sure if we&#039;re going to win this vote, but I am a Senator and I have an obligation to take this stand, not just for my constituents, but for all Americans who will be affected by this legislation directly and through its influence on future laws that will use the excuse of security to deprive all of us of our liberty rights. &lt;crowd goes bonkers&gt;. <br /><br />Along comes this issue and Obama has an opportunity to take a leadership role concerning a serious issue of national importance. We&#039;re talking about the evisceration of the 4th and 9th Amendments, after all.<br /><br />Hillary is clearly a hypocrite for taking shots at Obama over his voting record being dominated with &quot;attendance&quot; votes. The truth is they both dropped the ball here. They didn&#039;t stand against this legislation in the one way that would be different from the rest of us bitching and moaning. They are not on the record. <br /><br />Some might say that missing one vote isn&#039;t the end of the world. That&#039;s true. It&#039;s a continuum of politicians who should know better missing one vote after another, not taking these stands that have serious repercussions for the relationship between individuals and the State, not drawing the line where our freedoms are supposed to constrain state power. <br /><br />Obama and Hillary suck ass for not voting against this. McCain sucks ass for voting for it. They all suck. And we&#039;re the ones that pay for it.&nbsp; :x

				The jobs American&#039;s can&#039;t be bothered to do argument has to be a myth, at least in part.&nbsp; The reason people come here is not because we won&#039;t do certain jobs.&nbsp; It is because they can make more money here and send it home to their families.&nbsp; We have a large underclass in this country who is willing to do almost any job to get by.&nbsp; That is to say nothing of our homeless population who could probably use jobs as well.

				I actually agree with you that outsourcing has had many negative effects on our country and on our economy, despite the cheap goods that we get coming in from places like China.&nbsp; The only concern I have is that, despite the rhetoric, I don&#039;t even see someone like McCain standing up to the corporations, who are only looking at the bottom line and are cutting costs and firing American workers on a daily basis (I don&#039;t see anyone from the Democrats really doing that either, to be completely fair).

				The problem with arguing against shipping jobs overseas is that you&#039;re also then increasing prices of everything.&nbsp; If we didn&#039;t have immigrant labor (legal or illegal), cheap manufacturing in other countries, or cheaper workforce options, everything would COST MORE.&nbsp; Americans want things cheaply and to maintain low prices means to move jobs and services to where things are cheap.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s the principle free markets and, unfortunately, it seems that most Americans don&#039;t want to accept that.&nbsp; It is all interconnected.&nbsp; We expect/demand lower prices, yet higher wages.&nbsp; Companies can&#039;t let their margins get cut by doing either (or both) of the above, so they have to find other ways to provide that; with an obvious bias to lower prices.<br /><br />Even these &quot;cheap goods&quot; bring jobs.&nbsp; Wal-Mart (while being a horrible employer) has provided many people with jobs.&nbsp; The shipping companies that bring products into the country and to the stores have brought more jobs, the amount of people needed to market those products increase, etc.&nbsp; While it might be frustrating to call an airline and have to talk with someone in India that is tough to understand; but that &quot;inconvenience&quot; to you and cost savings to the airline has allowed them to buy more planes, have more routes, and keep fares down.&nbsp; If they kept those jobs in the US, they would likely not be able to do those things. <br /><br />I grew up in a town where just about everyone&#039;s parents worked for GM/GE/Delphi/etc., made good money, and had great bennies.&nbsp; They were able to specialize in one thing and never had to worry about learning new trades, getting degrees, or constantly wondering if their jobs were secure.&nbsp; But, those days are over.&nbsp; Complacency hurt the American auto industry and everything with it.&nbsp; The people who never had or cared to learn other trades were left hung out to dry.<br /><br />It&#039;s the same now.&nbsp; Thinking that we can keep jobs from going overseas, yet still get high salaries and low prices, is futile.&nbsp; Globalization is inevitable as information and technology expand.&nbsp; The only way to combat it is to diversify your talents by learning other trades, furthering your education, constantly keeping an eye out for developing trends, and keeping expenses low and a solid savings buffer in case of downturns/lost employment.<br /><br />It is a vacuum.&nbsp; As jobs go overseas, new ones are created here.&nbsp; However, they require more knowledge and, perhaps, different skills.&nbsp; But, as long as the worker always keeps their &quot;tools&quot; sharp, there will always be a need for them.&nbsp; We&#039;ve become a much more &quot;educated&quot; and &quot;skilled&quot; society because of this pressure to continually evolve and the lack of complacency in employment.&nbsp; Personally, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a bad thing.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				Really, I&#039;m not sure where I stand on punishing business who outsource or on the delivery tipping thing, I just think they&#039;re kinda contradictory positions. Either we owe people a living wage and it&#039;s up to allow of us to contribute, or we don&#039;t and it&#039;s tough noogies. Part of me agrees with both and I understand that they&#039;re complex, nuanced and personal issues.

There&#039;s something respectable about a blue collar lifestyle and a factory town that I admire somewhere. <br /><br />I feel a lot of respect for many different ways of life and I&#039;ve waited tables, schleped mail and done all kinds of odd jobs. I&#039;ve even had a brief stint of wondering homelessness. We&#039;ve all went through some crazy things at one point or another and things that so directly affect the quality of so many lives are hard to decide.<br /><br />While the ideal behind something may be clear, the implimentation is often hard to discern. I, for one, appreciate the rational behind a belief almost as much as the belief itself. I really appreciate this board because of the number of people here that I disagree with completely, but because they express their thoughts in a manner that proves they are articulate and well-thought out, I can respect their opinions to the utmost.<br /><br />And that last paragraph? Couldn&#039;t agree more.

				Wow, I take my eyes off of this thread for a minute and look where it is!<br /><br />I was in an interesting position once to hear about one of my old co-workers friends losing their job in a factory in New Orleans metro because it was shipped out to Mexico. &nbsp;It was an obviously an emotional issue, so I managed to keep my mouth shut, so I just kept it to myself that this factory probably left Brooklyn 40 years ago to come to NO.<br /><br />It sucks to lose those jobs to the folks overseas, but that is the inevitable tide and in some industries, we just can&#039;t compete in. &nbsp;But something else will take its place.<br /><br />

I have a decent job, at a good company, where I&#039;m valued for what I do. I&#039;ve also been continuosly employed since I was 14 years old and have never been unemployed so in many ways I&#039;ve been very lucky. I may not be in the future but as I said, I&#039;ll be alright, no probs here.<br /><br />This will be my last comment, so I&#039;ll leave you with this thought: There are plenty of people who work very hard and have little to show for it. Hard work does not equal success. You may all think you are masters of your destinies, that you have choices, that your employer needs you more than you need them, but beware the sucker punch that lurks &#039;round the corner.<br /><br />Your choices dwindle as you progress along the timeline, as your families and waistlines grow. That&#039;s the way of life. I think it&#039;s worth extending a little generosity of spirit and compassion now to others who may not be so talented and lucky as all of you are -- you may need some generosity extended to you in the future.<br /><br />...cue soft music...<br /><br />And a good evening to all.<br /><br /><br />
