				Does anyone know anything more about Con Ed selling some of their land in Astoria to Fed Ex for a distribution center? More importantly when/where is a community meeting where we can voice opposition to this idea?

				If its their land along the waterfront it would be swell to have the city buy it and turn it into some public space.&nbsp; Is there any sort of linkage to this news or additional information... or any information?

				That&#039;s a great idea, but we all know that ain&#039;t gonna happen. I would rather see the land sold to ANYONE that isn&#039;t one of those over-priced condo developers. I don&#039;t think FedEx trucks would be causing any more problems than the ConEd trucks. At least we wouldn&#039;t have to deal with another 200–400 more cars looking for parking and 300–500 more people using our declining infrastructure.

(Seriously, there are a lot of trucks. But it comes with the territory. It&#039;s a main drag just south of an industrial area.) What&#039;s some more FedEx trucks? No big deal.<br /><br />(I used to live near a pretty big UPS distribution center, and while they were a common sight, they weren&#039;t clogging the streets or anything. They were all driving to other places.)<br /><br />Also, if you miss a FedEx delivery that has to be signed for, this will make it super easy for people in the neighborhood to go pick up their missed deliveries. It&#039;s a 5ish minute walk from the Ditmars stop, or if you drive, parking on 20th Ave. is pretty easy.

The current configuration of fuel oil storage tanks close to the river means that all that land would have to be dug up and moved somewhere. And remember that the facilities used to burn coal which would make reclamation a nightmare.

				Great links Heff, thanks!<br />I only wish it was a UPS site instead of FedEx, if we&#039;re going to get one.&nbsp; Maspeth is not an easy place to get to when you want to stop them from returning a package.

				I saw this today in The News. Apparently FedEx wants to build a facility on part of the ConEd property off 20th Avenue and upper Ditmars. The last thing we need is more trucks and pollution in this area.
