			<strong>Egglantine</strong>:
			<br />
			This is a new bakery/cookie store opening at 3006 34th St. I heard that a customer&#039;s child accidentally broke their custom-made neon sign and the customer offered to pay for it. The person behind the counter (not sure if it was the owner) quoted $500 and the customer paid it. Later, the store returned the $500 to the customer after the story got around and they received complaints. <br /><br />What kind of new business treats a member of their community like that? Even if it was a joke, or a misunderstanding, or the action of a badly informed employee, the money should never have been accepted. This really leaves a bad taste in my mouth (no pun intended).
