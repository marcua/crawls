				I am going to be doing some extended travel so I&#039;m subletting my apartment while I&#039;m away. <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;The apartment; <br />&nbsp;The apartment is on the ground floor of a house on a quiet side street and has a private garden. The apartment is furnished and high speed internet access is included, The Broadway G/R/V stop is one short block away. <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;The bedroom: <br />&nbsp;The bedroom is 10&#039;x18&#039;, carpeted with a large closet and a garden view. There is currently only a bed in the room but I have tables, chairs, book shelves, etc. that you can use. <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;The rest of the apartment: <br />&nbsp;The living room faces the garden and has a futon and coffee table. The kitchen is fully equipped and has a microwave, espresso maker, etc. There is room to store a bike in the front hallway. <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;The garden: <br />&nbsp;The garden is private and has a patio. There is a firepit, table, chairs, hammock, and a bench. Perfect for barbecues or just relaxing after a long day! <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;The neighborhood: <br />&nbsp;The apartment is located in a quiet part of the Broadway area of Astoria. The neighborhood is very safe. Nearby are all the usual services and entertainment, several health clubs and a swimming pool. The G/R/V subway is 1 block away and the N/W is a 10 minute walk. Transit time to Midtown is about 20 minutes. <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Rent and utilities: <br />&nbsp;The rent is $1350 a month (includes gas and high-speed internet access) plus electric (which is typically around $50-$75 depending on AC usage). In addition there is a one month security deposit which will be returned when you move out provided the apartment is in good condition. There is currently no cable television but this can be added if desired. <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Dates and duration: <br />&nbsp;Move in date is flexible (between now and the first week of July). I am looking for a 4 month minimum commitment.<br /><br />(http://)<br /><table class="bbc_table"><tr><td>(http://alephnull.net/apt/1.jpg)</td><td>(http://alephnull.net/apt/3.jpg)</td></tr><tr><td>(http://alephnull.net/apt/4.jpg)</td><td>(http://alephnull.net/apt/2.jpg)</td></tr></table>

				A couple of additional things:<br /><br />About you: <br />&nbsp;I am looking for someone pet-free who is reasonably neat. A non-smoker is preferred; smoking in the garden is OK but not in the apartment. <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;If you have questions you can send me an email at adn@alephnull.net or call me at 646-734-4297
