				I went to 122 G&amp;T and I&#039;m awesome and brilliant!&nbsp; (But not confident.)&nbsp; In all seriousness, the teachers are amazing and very dedicated.&nbsp; Some of the best teachers I had in my life were in 7th grade (and even then, I knew it).&nbsp; It was challenging and nurturing at the same time.&nbsp; Very unique.&nbsp; I look back and can&#039;t believe my education was free.&nbsp; Almost everyone with whom I graduated went to Stuyvesant or Science.&nbsp; &nbsp;They put a great deal of emphasis on prepping for the specialized schools.&nbsp; I can&#039;t speak for the rest of the school but whenever the 122 G&amp;T program comes up, I vote yes yes yes.&nbsp; Do it.&nbsp; Get your kids on the right track.&nbsp; I can&#039;t imagine anyone regretting that choice.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I can only really talk about&nbsp; 122. My son is in 1st grade there. Overall I am happy with the school. The teachers seem good, his teacher in particular is very good, he is learning a lot and he really loves her. I&#039;ve had a few issues here and there but they are always addressed immediately, either by meeting with the teacher or the assistant principal. Even though the school is huge, the assistant principal, principal and tons of the teachers know my son by name. <br /><br /><br />Now, negatives are:<br />1) they never go outside if the weather is anything short of perfect. <br />2) they cut the dance program for all but the &quot;gifted&quot; students<br />3) if your child isn&#039;t in the &quot;gifted&quot; program, he/she will not get as many resources (see #2)<br />4) I was less than impressed with the kindergarten curriculum. It was geared toward kids who had never gone to pre-K and never done any academic work at home either (literally learning letters, letter sounds, etc). My son was VERY bored. (1st grade has been much better!)<br />5) the school is HUGE. It can seem less-than-welcoming when you literally dump your child at the door instead of being allowed into the building in the AM. <br /><br /><br />Overall, though, I would say that 122 is a better-than-average neighborhood school, it certainly is sought-after by parents.<br /><br /><br />I have been in PS 85 a few times and the only thing I can say with certainly is that when the subway goes by, it is LOUD. I can&#039;t imagine how the kids can concentrate with that going on all day!

				Hello all,<br />Bringing up this topic again. Any one with experience with the G/T Kinder programs in Astoria?&nbsp; Is there an advantage to a city-wide program (85) over a district-wide program (122)?<br /><br /><br />Thanks!!

				Congratulations!<br />&nbsp;<br />Some things to consider - <br />&nbsp;<br />Right now 122 has a guaranteed middle school TAG program where as 85 does not have guaranteed TAG placement for middle school.&nbsp; There is a movement right now to try to get 85 kids a TAG middle school, but it doesn&#039;t currently exist.<br />&nbsp;<br />Look at before/afterschool programs if you think you&#039;ll be using them.<br />&nbsp;<br />Again - congratulations and welcome to the whirlwind.&nbsp; &nbsp;My daughter is at 150 in TAG if you have any questions.

				@ BoredTemp,<br />Thanks for your quick response!&nbsp; I suppose thinking ahead to middle school wasn&#039;t on my radar as I&#039;m just starting to understand the K process! LOL.&nbsp; How do you and your daughter like 150?&nbsp; I had read somewhere that they had no outdoor play space.

				Ah - the review on great schools is completely wrong.&nbsp; The Pre-K and kindergarten students have a lovely new annex which has a great outdoor space.&nbsp; The main building has outdoor space too, but they don&#039;t allow the kids on the jungle gyms.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />My daughter loves Ms. Chance, the kindergarten teacher.&nbsp; They are learning an incredible amount.&nbsp; &nbsp;Coming from IMMAC, it&#039;s hard for us to get used to such a big school and all the red-tape, but on the whole we like it.&nbsp; &nbsp;They have music and drama weekly, even in kindergarten, which is a big plus.

				my daughter is at STEM at PS85.&nbsp; We went back and forth about STEM versus 122.&nbsp; So far we are very pleased with STEM--the kids are super bright and the teachers are fabulous. we feel like our daughter is being challenged and is thriving. the school has made a big push to have recess every day, and the afterschool program (serious fun) is really great.&nbsp; come to our tour next Wed. and learn more.&nbsp; I was also very impressed with PS 122 when I visited.&nbsp;

				I&#039;m also a parent at PS 85Q. We&#039;ve been very happy so far - the school is both challenging and nurturing which was important to us and we think the school does a very good job of nurturing and addressing the needs of every student and family. The cluster classes (chess, robotics, music, science) have been great and there is a lot of enrichment. We&#039;ve been very pleased with the after school program - and we do think the middle school issue will be worked out in time for the current third graders to go to middle school. <br /><br />Also, fyi - there&#039;s a forum and panel discussion for anyone interested in the citywides, including STEM, next Tuesday evening at PS 20 in Manhattan at 7 p.m. Parents from each citywide will be there to answer questions, give information etc. It&#039;s not sponsored by DOE or the schools - purely by parents. <br /><br />good luck and congrats!! <br /><br />

				My eldest son went to 85 for pre K then went to 122. My youngest is now in 122 in third grade.<br />I was told when I moved into the area that PS 122 was a really good school. If you go on the school website you can see the grades each school received. I have enclosed the links for both schools:<br />http://schools.nyc.gov/OA/SchoolReports/2010-11/Progress_Report_Overview_2011_EMS_Q085.pdf (http://schools.nyc.gov/OA/SchoolReports/2010-11/Progress_Report_Overview_2011_EMS_Q085.pdf)<br /><br /><br />http://schools.nyc.gov/OA/SchoolReports/2010-11/Progress_Report_Overview_2011_EMS_Q122.pdf (http://schools.nyc.gov/OA/SchoolReports/2010-11/Progress_Report_Overview_2011_EMS_Q122.pdf)<br /><br /><br />You can see for yourself the ratings.<br />As for personal experience I think both of my children have done well at 122. My older son went from K-5. He is now in the honors program at IS 141.<br />I think the key thing is you have to know your child. If you have a bright and academically gifted child you can test to be in the Academy program at PS 122 which goes through to 8th grade. Be warned it is alot of hard work. If your child doesn&#039;t have the personal motivation to keep up, it can be difficult. <br />I think my one problem with 122 has been that the arts classes do get cut ( specifically dance) , and they are very rigid about going outside for recess. I think though with the new playground they are more likely to send the kids outside. Both of my sons have had wonderful teachers. But as with all situations in life there is one who may not work well with my child. If ever you have that problem just go in and talk to the administration.<br /><br /><br />I will say as a parent , if you stay on top of your child, you will have a very good experience at PS 122.<br />Check homework, ( the new math is sooo much fun) see what your child is doing in class, talk to the teachers. But above all, take responsibility for your child. I have seen too many parents blame teachers , when they never hold their children accountable for their actions. yes even at 5 years old they have their personalities and they come shining through.<br /><br /><br />One lesson I learned having my children: Never be the parent that says my child would never.......<br /><br />

				Thanks all for your comments!&nbsp; Does anyone have experience or knowledge about PS 166?&nbsp; Also, I am not sure what the likelihood is of getting a placement in Queens, does anyone know about TAG young scholars or PS/IS 217 in Roosevelt Island or even the general experience of having your child go to school in Manhattan?&nbsp; &nbsp;:rolleyes:

				Please take a minute and contact Chancellor Walcott to ask for more G&amp;T seats throughout the city and in District 30.&nbsp; The only way that G&amp;T education will get more support is if the DOE realizes that there is a real demand for change.&nbsp; <br />And, please, ask all your friends (especially those whose kids just got their OLSAT scores) to contact the Chancellor as well.&nbsp; <br />Here is the link to make an online comment.&nbsp; http://schools.nyc.gov/ContactDOE/ (http://schools.nyc.gov/ContactDOE/).&nbsp; You can also call at (718) 935-2000.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;
