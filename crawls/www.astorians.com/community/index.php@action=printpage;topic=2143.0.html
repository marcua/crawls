				Having lived in some sketchy places over the years, I have had my share of rats.&nbsp; It&#39;s not as gross as it sounds - no rats inside the house, but still creepy nonetheless.&nbsp; You know what&#39;s scarier (for me anyway) - raccoons.&nbsp; They are fierce creatures and not easily scared.&nbsp; At least rats scurry away; raccoons for the most part, don&#39;t.<br /><br />Does anyone remember the movies &quot;Willard&quot; or &quot;Ben&quot;?&nbsp; Rats, rats, rats!

				Raccoons will fight with you; possums usually run away.<br /><br />But yes, they are freaky looking.&nbsp; I used to see a lot of possum roadkill on the highways of California.

				I don&#39;t like squirrels. Rather I don&#39;t TRUST squirrels. Feel like they don&#39;t have a proper fear of humans. Like they&#39;re going to launch onto me from a nearby tree when I&#39;m walking through the park.<br /><br />Okay, it&#39;s a bad sign that if you google squirrels, the fifth item has to do with killer squirrels attacking cyclists. Hello! This is not an unfounded fear. Now THAT&#39;s a horror movie: &quot;Attack of the Killer Squirrels!&quot;

				Heh.&nbsp; Squirrels.&nbsp; We used to have a humane squirrel trap that traps the squirrel in a little cage instead of crushing the life out of the poor animal or gluing it to a scrap of paper. Actually, I&#39;m not sure what animal it was designed for, but we used it for a squirrel in our garage. The part where the animal is trapped is a wire cage, so the animal won&#39;t suffocate if it&#39;s in there for a few hours. <br /><br />See, Jim&#39;s sister thought this squirrel she used to see was cute. So she began feeding it. A short while later, it moved into our garage to be closer to the food supply and started to cause a ruckus. Jim got the trap from his uncle and set it up. Voil√†, caught squirrel. When Jim approached the cage, the squirrel went ballistic and began zooming around the cage, cannoning off of the walls. Mind you, this is a space that&#39;s about 15&quot;x10&quot;x10&quot;. He bundled the cage onto the back of his recumbent bike and set off for Astoria Park.<br /><br />Now. Imagine you are driving down the street and you see a recumbent bicyclist stopped at a red light. You pull up beside him and you hear a strange noise. You realise that it is coming from the back of the strange looking bike. Upon further inspection, you notice that there is this metal cage thing with some sort of furred creature inside rocketing around with such force that the bicycle is actually shaking. Your eyes slowly rake over the human propelling the bike as you realise you are dealing with someone who is clearly slightly demented.<br /><br />Jim arrives at the park slightly shaken but otherwise unharmed. He sets the cage, not without some difficulty, on the ground, leans over, and gingerly opens the trap door.<br /><br />Nothing.<br /><br />The damn squirrel won&#39;t leave. Jim resorts to shaking the cage before the squirrel reluctantly hops out. Jim puts the cage back on the bike, turns the bike around and starts to walk off. He turns around to look. The squirrel is following him.<br /><br />However, the squirrel never came back to the garage. More nuts in the park, I suppose.<br /><br />Someday, I can tell you about the drowned squirrel in my backyard when I lived in a garden apartment in Park Slope.&nbsp; For now, I&#39;ll just say that drowned squirrels look remarkably like drowned rats.

				So I had been thinking about sharing this story on Astorians beforehand, but wasn&#39;t sure I wanted it to be my first post here (never posted before).&nbsp; However, now that I&#39;ve seen this topic (thanks to Samantha for pointing it out, who had to hear this whole story the first time I met her since it had just happened!), I just had to respond, so alas - my first post will be about rats!&nbsp; Well, one rat in particular...<br /><br />So the other day, I was walking to the Hell Gate CSA meeting, and I passed through that playground right by the Astoria Blvd station.&nbsp; As I approached the exit by the swings onto 29th St, I had my head to the ground (lost in thought about the yummy veggies I&#39;d get from the CSA I&#39;m sure) and thus did not see until the very last moment this speedy little gray creature zooming on a crash course for my feet.&nbsp; My first thought was chipmunk (I know, they&#39;re not in the city but it was one of those instantaneous brain associations) or squirrel (obviously my brain did not want to consider the much less pleasant possibility).&nbsp; <br /><br />Not until it had collided with my feet and I had jumped into the air, did I realize it was a plump, gray RAT.&nbsp; After I jumped, my feet landed right back down on the creature and I could feel its squishiness underneath me.&nbsp; I kept jumping and screaming as I tried desperately to get it out from under me!&nbsp; People walking behind me were screaming too, as they&#39;d seen the whole disgusting event.&nbsp; It felt like it lasted an eternity, as I kept jumping and still landing on the rat, though it probably only took 2 seconds to get off of it.&nbsp; <br /><br />As I finally walked *very* quickly away from the rat and out of the playground, I looked back for my only real glimpse of it, and I saw it rolling onto its back with its white belly up in the air.&nbsp; I could just imagine it groaning as it lay there rolling around.&nbsp; If I weren&#39;t so traumatized myself, I might have felt sorry for it.<br /><br />A nice woman who&#39;d been walking behind me asked if I was okay (um, not really), and as I continued down the street, I could hear a couple of high school girls replaying the event: &quot;Did you see how she kept jumping?!&nbsp; Oh my God!&nbsp; So gross!&quot;<br /><br />So that&#39;s my rather unfortunate &quot;interesting encounter with a rat&quot;.&nbsp; I can still feel its plump body under my shoes (oh the trauma), and whenever I pass through that playground exit - the scene of the crime - I can&#39;t help but look around nervously for speeding rats.

				Thanks so much for your sympathy, fellow Astorians!&nbsp; I&#39;m pretty much over the trauma by now, and now I appreciate the experience for the good (though gross) story it provides me!&nbsp; But I do still look around apprehensively for speedy rats when I walk through that playground exit.&nbsp; <br /><br />And Samantha - thanks for the welcome!
