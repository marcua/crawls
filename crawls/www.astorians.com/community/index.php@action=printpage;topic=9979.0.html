				Good to see this board come up. How do these things work? I&#039;ve never seen a public forum for singles online.<br />Do we all just interact on here and have everyone else just watch the drama unfold like a soap opera or bad Springer episode? :-D

				My stories are LEGENDARY. I&#039;m always threatening to write a book. I even get requests for a few of them at parties.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know how this whole thing should work, either. As the person who asked about it over on the Announcements board, I guess I should take some sort of initiative. Maybe we should start threads for age groups, orientation, etc.?&nbsp; Some sort of meetup eventually? Other thoughts???<br /><br />At any rate, I like the idea of a place for all the single kids to congregate via web&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				Hey, I am single! What do I do now? Where are the instructions for this?

Then if there are more than just a handful of us we can start up some more specific threads. So if you are single, just a little &quot;Hi, I am single&quot; will do fine.

				So far we seem to be overwhelmingly female. Argh. Come on guys, you know you wanna!<br /><br />I went speed dating once, too. One guy sent my friend and I form emails about how much he thought we had a connection, the only difference being the name of the person it was addressed to, and then we got angry, hate filled form emails a few days later when neither of us responded! It was a classic. Seed dating, well that just makes me blush&nbsp; :-*<br /><br />Maybe we should tell our ages (or just decades??) so we can get an idea of how we might group ourselves? Presumably the 50 y/o people aren&#039;t that interested in a meetup full of 20 y/o people, and vice versa. Although I guess you never know. I&#039;m 26. I would also volunteer to help with organizing an event. How does that work around here?

(Sorry, I don&#039;t venture off the Ditmars area as much as I should) I think most places would be happy to host an event like that for the publicity and income. I believe most places just require a minimum number of people to attend in order to close off an area.

				I&#039;m single, but not really looking right now.&nbsp; I would be interested in going to a singles event, though, just to hang out and meet new folks in the neighborhood.<br /><br />Since many of these start off with a lot of promise and enthusiasm and then fizzle and disappear, I was going to recommend holding this event during the week of April 20th.&nbsp; While I&#039;m not a fan of early weeknight events, it&#039;s really up to the majority.&nbsp; <br /><br />Regarding the location, I was going to recommend Indigo on 30th Avenue, close to the train station.&nbsp; There was an Astorian mixer held there last month http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=9624.0<br />I thought that this would be a good location because it&#039;s right off of the N/W and from what I understand has an upstairs bar that we might be able to reserve.&nbsp; If anyone else has recommendations, please share.&nbsp; <br /><br />Finally, I was wondering if we could invite other singles who are not in the group, but who would want to join us.&nbsp; For example, if you have a friend or acquaintance who wants to come, let &#039;em!&nbsp; The more singles, the more selection, I say.&nbsp; And besides, it&#039;s not like we&#039;re going to put an ad in craigslist about the event.&nbsp; <br /><br />These are just ideas for right now.&nbsp; Please respond with your own thoughts!

				I suppose it could be that women are less inclined to spend long hours in bars. Or maybe drunk girls are so desirable, they get married off right away.<br /><br />It seems like I see a considerable number of women working out in health clubs I pass by.<br /><br />In olden days, I took some evening cooking classes in an adult education thingy at Bryant High School, and found the ratio to my advantage.<br /><br />Museums, libraries, movie theaters (for some movies), I see women at these places.<br />

I thought that moving up from a studio to a 1 bedroom would be good for a kitty-free sleeping space, but nope. That experiment lasted a half hour. I suppose if I&#039;d been able to put up with them throwing themselves against the door and yowling until they realized I wouldn&#039;t open the door, it might have worked, but I was afraid that they would hurt themselves. <br /><br />Also, about what I said about not dating a guy with cats, I&#039;m not completely serious about that. First, I have yet to meet a guy with cats that I&#039;d date, because usually he had something else going on that was a dealbreaker. If he was otherwise perfect for me and had cats, I wouldn&#039;t turn him down for that. It&#039;s just a preference, not a mandatory thing. So y&#039;all can unbunch your panties now.

				I see there is an interest in having a singles mixer.&nbsp; I had recommended that we have the week of the 20th, at Indigo, next to the 30th Avenue stop.&nbsp; However, people were still introducing themselves, so it might have just got overlooked.<br /><br />What does everyone think about Wednesday, April 23, at 7:00 PM, at Indigo?&nbsp; My logic with the choice of time and location, is that it&#039;s the middle of the week and who doesn&#039;t need an excuse to hang out to get over the &quot;hump.&quot;?&nbsp; I thought about Indigo because there was a previous mixer there and I believe that they have an upstairs area that can be reserved.&nbsp; It&#039;s convenient for anyone who takes the N/W.&nbsp; Here&#039;s their website (warning: you may want to turn the volume down on your computer if you&#039;re at work; I found out the hard way) http://www.indigobarnyc.com/<br /><br />Anyway, that&#039;s my recommendation.&nbsp; I can contact the owner of Indigo or someone who is a regular or knows them better can inquire about reserving space there.

				to ; 11105ASTNY&nbsp; &nbsp;the web-site and it&#039;s topics are great !&nbsp; the topic &#039;&#039;single and dating&#039;&#039; was put out a few months ago , which did&#039;nt do well . personal it&#039;s ashame that it did&#039;nt do well . i think it&#039;s better to meet someone on this site , then say meet someone at a bar. the singles board ( so far) is just people introducing themselfs and that&#039;s it . maybe something will click . anyway , enjoy the web-site . take care ,bye

				We did have a singles event once but I dont know if anyone made any connections. I made some new friends but no love interests from it. I wish this post would get more interest also.....<br /><br />I&#039;ll start- I&#039;m 27-straight, white, female - short, average shape, brown hair/brown eyes.... usually tan- love the beach and love animals. super close to my family and friends ... but I work too many hours...

				I think the true problem is that everyone wanted a singles board, but simply introducing yourself with your age and stats isn&#039;t really enticing enough to anyone to make them want to respond. I mean, online dating, using a full profile and pictures and everything, already doesn&#039;t have a huge response rate. A message board posting by itself isn&#039;t going to do much to liven up your social life either. Offline events are the way to go, however, it&#039;s hard to schedule for maximum attendance. Also, there&#039;s no guarantee that there will be people there who meet your basic criteria (e.g., age, looks, interests, etc.). My advice would be to pay attention to the people posting. If you like what they write, PM them. If they&#039;re interested, they&#039;ll write back. Then either get to know each other online or meet up and see if there&#039;s chemistry. That&#039;s the way it was done way back when message boards were the entirety of the internet. You can&#039;t just post &quot;hey, I&#039;m single, get at me&quot; and expect the hotties to pile up at your door.

				Hmm, I agree with you CountingZestfully on most accounts.<br /><br />I don&#039;t agree with PMing random people you don&#039;t know anything about except that you like what they randomly write.<br /><br />I&#039;d vote creating your own thread (as opposed to just doing a shout out on this thread) with more detailed information about yourself and what you&#039;re looking for and see who contacts you. Maybe suggest an activity.<br /><br />My 2 cents.

				I guess it was too subtly implied that you would engage in discourse on the boards first by replying to their messages before PMing. But even without that, a PM saying, &quot;Hey, what you wrote was really cool&quot; is a nice in. It&#039;s about starting small and building from there, not PMing saying, &quot;Hey, you sound hot, wanna get together?&quot; I doubt that would ever go over well. It&#039;s a mistake that people make offline as well as online, jumping too far ahead too soon. It&#039;s exactly why just walking up to someone hot and telling them that you&#039;re looking for a new boyfriend/girlfriend is a creepy move. There&#039;s a progression. First you say hi, you establish a rapport by sharing small (sometimes impersonal), basic bits of info, and then move to more in-depth conversation. When you just dive in to the more intimate stuff, you are forcing someone to make an evaluative decision about you without enough information, and you&#039;re more likely than not to get rejected.

				Both of you guys make a good point, I think what we need is a matchmaker. Someone who can come up with some<br />qualifying standards to make a match of some sort, chemistry starts when people have stuff in common. I wonder who<br />would be such a person to play match maker !!!!!!! :mrgreen:

				<br />At the last mixer, which took place at Rest-au-Rant, there was a lot of interest in having the next mixer at Broadway Station. So here goes!<br /><br />How about next Wednesday, Sept 10, 7.30 at Broadway Station (on Broadway - next to the station).<br /><br />Singles, non-singles, and single-but-not-lookings are all welcome and encouraged to attend.
