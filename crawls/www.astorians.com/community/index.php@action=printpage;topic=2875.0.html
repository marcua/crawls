				I like Athena Nails on 30th Ave/31st St.&nbsp; They have like 30 employees and a dozen pedicure chairs so you can always walk right in, pick a color and your on your way!&nbsp; The basic pedicure is $13 and it last a long long time.

				Cool, thanks! I usually go to another place (at Broadway and 34th: &#39;bamboo beauty&#39;) and they&#39;re great but since the turnover rate there is high, there are more and more women there who don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing. You end up paying to be guinea pig for their on-the-job-training. Sad.&nbsp; I&#39;ll check out Athena!!<br /><br />thanks again

				My main concern is cleanliness. I have been to the nail salon (Rainbow, I think) on 31st St. and 41st Ave. and they do not clean the basins between clients. I don&#39;t care if there are many people waiting, I wish they would dump some bleach in there between pedicures. It grossed me out and I stopped going even though it is around the corner. I have also been to Be.Be. Nails on Broadway and 43rd Street and they seem to have fewer customers and more time to clean up between clients.

				While we&#39;re on nail salons, does anyone know how long your nails have to be to get tips put on? I have a horrible nail biting habit and have been thinking getting tips put on might help me quit; then I can actually get a real manicure.

				I am a Bamboo fan myself (34th and Broadway). I always ask for Wendy or Elizabeth. I agree some of the other girls are not that great. $15 dollars for a manicure/pedicure is such a deal! The place across the street from me in Manhattan charges $28 just for a pedicure. What a rip off!

				Athena&#39;s seems to be the most popular, I&#39;m going to give them a try sometime next week. I never, ever, go to nail salons. I&#39;ve never had a pedicure. I think I got my nails done once, for my senior prom. Well, I&#39;m getting married in 31 days so it&#39;s time to get them done again! Do any of your ladies have plans to go next week after work? Is an appointment necessary? (Also, being uneducated in the area of nails, does it make sense for me to get the mani/pedi the 1st week of September, and then go back like 1-2 days before the wedding to get them redone? I figure this way I can get used to the process.)

				<br />acrylic tips - bad for your nails. and kinda old school, thick and clunky and smelly<br />UV gel nail tips - i have this right now and i LOVE them. its the closest thing to natural you can get if your going to get anything over your nails. its a bit expensive and a bit time consuming but the results last and you don&#39;t have to apply polish and they stay shiny the whole time.<br />silk wrap -&nbsp; not bad, this along with fiberglass is pretty much the same i think. i had these for a few years. they are pretty durable, but dont let your nails do much breathing.<br /><br />you can ask them to just to a regular gel manicure. thats applying the gel that that they would use for a silk/powder job but not add anything else. its relatively thin and natural and may be a good place good place to start. make sure they dont do the uv, just a gel mani.<br /><br />i&#39;ve been doing these things to my nails for about 10 years, my nails are paper. they pretty much lose all strength when you do these things too. mine were hopeless. when i do take everything off for a rest time ( a month or two every year) mine wont pass my finger level just cause they bend and break.<br /><br />anything else? ask away!<br />

				YEAH FLOOZIE<br />Thanks, dahling!<br />You are so much more informative than the 20 minutes of Googling I did on this matter! Amazing. <br />SO yeah, my need is just for strength and reinforcement: I don&#39;t need no rhinestones or crazy FloJo talons or something... In fact, I want them moderately short. Just shiny and smooth and natural-colored. How sad that we have to do this just for normal fingernails!<br /><br />PS- have you tried eating more gelatin? I tried and it didn&#39;t really work... maybe I need to be gnawing on marrow bones or something.

				they also sell a polish for strenghtening that i heard lots of good from. nailteque or something like that. thay also use it at Athena&#39;s if you ask for it with a reg mani for an additional cost. me and my nail woes, ugh i hear ya. but&nbsp; would seriously try these not so serious methods first before any of the &quot;big guns&quot; treatments, cause if they dont work like you want them too, your nails will be worse for the wear.
