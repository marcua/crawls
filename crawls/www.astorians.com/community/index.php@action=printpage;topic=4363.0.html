				I got an urgent notice from AOL in the mail saying that my account is past due, has been suspended due to non-payment, and that I owe them $103.60.<br /><br />I don&#39;t have an account with AOL. <br /><br />I wrote this on the top of the bill and had it sealed and ready to send when I got another notice from them. It said that my account was 130 days past due and has been referred to the AOL collections department. <br /><br />I called them and said I didn&#39;t have an account. The CSR on the other end of the line said, yes, I did. I said no, I didn&#39;t. She said I had signed up for an account three years ago, didn&#39;t I remember? <br /><br />Three years ago I *did* use a Free Trail AOL CD. I was very careful about not using too many minutes and I only used it briefly. I told her this. She said &quot;Yes but we charge for access, not for use.&quot; HUH???????<br /><br />After quite a bit of back and forth I asked to speak to her supervisor. She said I couldn&#39;t. I said I would call back. I found another AOL customer service number and called that but it was a voice-operated system that would only allow me to speak to a csr rep if I provided an account number - not for AOL - but for my credit card, checking account, or debit card!!!<br /><br />I am so pissed. I know it&#39;s only 103.60, but for Christ&#39;s sake. It&#39;s been three years and out of the blue they start this collections crap? I have received no other bills from them. And this is not even an invoice!!! They&#39;ve provided no record of my usage! It&#39;s just &quot;you owe us&quot;.&nbsp; Assholes. I am NOT paying this.

				Ack.&nbsp; Sorry to hear about that.&nbsp; I&#39;ve heard stories about AOL being horrifically hard to get rid of from those free trials.&nbsp; I don&#39;t know what number you dialled, but apparently if you call 1-800-827-6364 or 6568, press 0 at the prompt and don&#39;t say anything, you will eventually get a live person.<br /><br />By the way, here (http://gethuman.com/us/) is a list of many major businesses with phone numbers that let you get through to people.

				There should be some agency that regulates AOL that you can call and file a complaint.&nbsp; I would start with the NYS Attorney General and see where they refer you.&nbsp; Good luck!&nbsp; AOL is evil.

				I have a couple suggestions for dealing with stuff like this. MCI did this to me a couple times and it&#39;s becoming more and more popular as corporations realize that many consumers don&#39;t even know their rights.<br /><br />First - Don&#39;t ever call. It doesn&#39;t really work and just gets you mad. If you want to call just do it for fun, but don&#39;t expect to get anything done that way. You are talking to a collector - they are not interested in &quot;correcting&quot; the error, they are interested in &quot;collecting&quot; the money whether you owe it or not. They get paid based on how much they collect, so they are not interested in solving the problem.<br /><br />Second - Write them a letter (everything should be in writing) explaining that you dispute the full amount and that they are attempting to bill you for services not rendered. Request that all documentation related to the account be sent to you for your review. They are required by law (see below) to do so before they report you to any CRA (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_Rating_Agency).<br /><br />Third - Include in the letter that you are giving them notice to cease telephonic communication (though they haven&#39;t started, this makes sure that they communicate to you via letter and don&#39;t start calling you). If they call you after you&#39;ve sent this to them make sure to log the date and time they called. Also, if they call make sure you get the name and telephone number of the person you are speaking to.<br /><br />Lastly - Sign and date the letter and send it via Certified Mail with return receipt. That way when they write you again claiming you are ignoring them you can give them the Certified Mail number and include a copy of their signed return receipt (which the post office sends back to you.)<br /><br />When they follow up with you with another threatening letter let them know that you have already disputed the amount in full and that they haven&#39;t rendered any services to you. Also let them know that violations of the FCBA (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Credit_Billing_Act) and FCRA (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Credit_Billing_Act) will be dealt with accordingly.<br /><br />This stuff happens all the time, it&#39;s really no big deal. It&#39;s not like they have anything personal against you - it&#39;s frustrating, but just the reality of corporate America sadly. I hope this helps.

				It&#39;s possible that this is phishing.&nbsp; Don&#39;t give them any personal information at all.

				I wondered about that too, goldfish boy. When I called I didn&#39;t give them any info that wasn&#39;t on the letter (which was sent to my old address, and which had such a glaring grammatical error (a particularly grating comma splice) in the 2nd paragraph that I questioned the validity of the whole thing). <br /><br />I am certainly NOT giving them my credit card number; I have read a number of stories about them billing people&#39;s accounts directly long after they promised not to. <br /><br />Merm, thanks for the info. I love the idea of not calling them. It just makes my blood pressure soar.

				The AOL reps have gone so far as to deny account cancellation requests made in the name of deceased people because such requests must be made by the account holder.&nbsp; That&#39;s how sick they are over there.&nbsp; They&#39;ve had to pay out millions already to NY and other states for such practices but it doesn&#39;t stop them from churning out the same lousy customer service.&nbsp; Stick to merm&#39;s directions and it&#39;ll that should be the least stressful way.&nbsp; You should also forward your ordeal to the bureau of better business.&nbsp;

Maybe it&#39;s agood idea to look up the regular AOL customer number to see if it matches what you received in the mail. If nothing else, call what youknow is the real number and find out if this is all for real.

				I&#39;m joining in with skepticism.&nbsp; It is true that if you sign up for the free X number of hours they automatically create an account, and bill you for it unless you call them to cancel.&nbsp; However, in order to use the free hours you have to give them a credit card number, so they would have started billing you already, and you would have noticed in the first month.&nbsp; (I know because this happened to me.&nbsp; I called, and they gave me a bit of a hard time about it, but I insisted and they cancelled it.)

				A number of companies with free months do this, such as Netflix and magazines subscriptions.&nbsp; It seems to be a standard business practice and designed to rope you in.&nbsp; I am often careful about giving out my credit card info, because it is a pain to have to call and cancel after the free period is over.

				Thought this mioght be of interest. Oerhaps you should contact the New York State Attorney General&#39;s office.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">(http://www.miami.com/images/logos/site/miami/miamiherald/site_logo_340x60.gif)<br /><br />posted on Tue, Dec. 12, 2006<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>AOL settles over consumer complaints</strong></span><br />BY MONICA HATCHER<br />mhatcher@MiamiHerald.com<br /><br />Florida subscribers to AOL who have had problems with billing and membership charges could be entitled to refunds, credits or other restitution following a settlement between AOL and the state attorney general&#39;s office.<br /><br />Problems at AOL made national headlines after one customer, Vincent Ferrari, recorded an infuriating exchange and posted it online. All Ferrari wanted to do was cancel his AOL account. But it took him 20 minutes and a heated row with a customer service representative to accomplish his mission.<br /><br />The attorney general&#39;s office began investigating the Internet provider last year after getting more than 1,000 consumer complaints about cancellation requests being ignored, erroneous charges and unauthorized reactivations of accounts.<br /><br />AOL helped in the investigation, the attorney general said, by identifying consumers who were harmed by the practices.<br /><br />All Florida consumers who filed a complaint with the company are eligible to take part in the settlement. The attorney general&#39;s office also encourages customers who have had problems with the company to file a claim with their office by visiting www.myfloridalegal.com (http://myfloridalegal.com/newsrel.nsf/newsreleases/7784A3DA8241EDEB8525724200511B75).</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
