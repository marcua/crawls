And it&#39;s its own food group back in Texas.&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />On that note, as a New Yorker, country music is sort of a guilty pleasure for me. Although back home it&#39;s just called &quot;listening to music.&quot; In particular, Willie Nelson, Dwight Yoakum, Dixie Chicks, George Strait. And generally any country music from the late 80s/early 90s. Makes me feel all warm and fuzzy!<br /><br />John Mayer is a huge guilty pleasure. I get a lot of crap for being so in love with him at work, but I still am. Although I sincerely feel that his relationship with Jessica Simpson is a mistake and will flare out shortly. (she&#39;s on the rebound, and appears to be an idiot)<br /><br />On that note: US Weekly.<br /><br />Kelly Clarkson and Beyonce.<br /><br />thesartorialist.blogspot.com<br /><br />McGriddles.<br /><br />And thai iced tea (sometimes I get one when I&#39;m not eating thai - I just stop in and get the drink. YUM.)

				Something happened that forced me to revive this thread. <br /><br />I was bopping around in my car, listening to what I thought was a very catchy song...loving it, singing along, etc. I get home and visit my niece (who is five) and she has it blasting as well, and lo and behold, it is sung by mylie cyrus (aka hanna montana). (the song is &quot;to see you again&quot; I think)...I still love it, and it gets me in a good modd, but definitely a guilty pleasure. (i&#039;m 32 by the way)

				Any other &quot;Rock of Love with Bret Michels Part 2&quot; watchers out there? &nbsp;I just can&#039;t help it, I&#039;m so addicted I don&#039;t know why. &nbsp;I think of myself as a quasi feminist and the idea of all these fake boobied girls falling over each other for Bret Michels (barf by the way) is disgusting but I CAN&#039;T stop. &nbsp;I thought the first show had a more diverse selection of ladies, more tough kinda, cool, rocker ladies. &nbsp;This one is just like watching a train wreck.

I really spend way, waaaaay too much time here. Especially since I do not actually <em>live</em> in Astoria. Kind of like right now. When I should really be sleeping. My cat even got sick of waiting for me to come to bed and left! <br /><br />There&#039;s a lot of pleasures I have that <em>I</em> don&#039;t find guilty, but other people seem to think I should. For example, I read children&#039;s series books. I have the whole Series of Unfortunate Events by Lemony Snicket, and The Spiderwick Chronicles, and His Dark Materials, and Eragon, and I also enjoy coloring. With pencils, not crayons. They&#039;re better for lines. I have My Little Pony coloring books, and before I start, I go to http://mylittleponycollector.com/links/frm_checklists.htm (http://mylittleponycollector.com/links/frm_checklists.htm) and check the actual colors of the actual pony before I start. And I use the last page to match up the colors best I can. With my 72 pencil Roseart set. And I am not in the slightest bit ashamed of it. I took my coloring stuff to the US open during that bald guy&#039;s last game (I went with a friend because no one else would go with him and he agreed he&#039;d rather have me sit there and color than go alone) and yea, the people behind me were snickering, but did I care, NO! At least I was being quiet, and not on the phone or laptop or PSP or whatever. <br /><br />I read grown up books too, just for the record.

				Ha!Ha! I knew you were going to tell me that MsMAC! :-D Is that another guilty pleasure of yours? To reveal the truth about all those &quot;gourmet&quot; smoked fish stores? How they sneak ACME products through their back doors? I know, you feel absolutely no guilt about it whatsoever! I don&#039;t blame you! <br />And yes, now I genuinely feel guilty about spending all that money thanks to you, but I&#039;m glad Russ &amp; Daughters still exist in the Lower East Side.<br /><br />My BF wanted to go downtown that day-he had a craving for herring, what can I say.<br /><br />Yes, I can wait (drool).

Not a big fan of the song, but it does bring up a nice memory!<br /><br />Also, he was definitely a straight guy, so you&#039;re not alone!

				I saw this mentioned on another post and had to add it to this list:<br /><br />Starburst Jelly beans!&nbsp; It&#039;s my own personal crack, too!&nbsp; I ate a whole big bag while watching sitcoms on the WB one night.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t feel too good after that and it wasn&#039;t because of the the jelly beans.
