				I&#039;m moving to Astoria on August 1st from upstate. Found a wonderful place in upper Ditmars.<br /><br />My question is what does everyone budget for cable and internet?<br /><br />I need a fairly quick internet connection for work, and cable is a luxury.&nbsp; <br /><br />I could deal with over the air HD broadcast for TV because I have a Tivo unit, but have heard that the siganl is bad because of all the buildings.&nbsp; Anyone have experience with this?<br /><br />Thanks...

				My roommate and I split the cost of our cable/interet (Time Warner). She pays that bill, but I believe for cable with HBO and Showtime and the internet we pay about $120. I believe that the cost without the premiums for the two is around $99/mo.<br /><br />I can&#039;t speak to the Tivo issue b/c we have DVR and an HD TV, so our picture quality or reception has never been a problem.<br /><br />http://www.timewarnercable.com/nynj/Products/Cable/pricing_new.html &lt;- You can go here and play around with pricing options.

You do have to have someone from RCN to come over &amp; install the card (though I could have probably done it myself) and so they will charge a fee if you are already getting service with them. I don&#039;t know how they handle it with new customers - maybe they will waive it, I don&#039;t know.<br /><br />I really like not having to deal with an extra box cluttering things up, it makes channel changing *much* easier and reception has been great. Every once in a while the Tivo restarts on me and I don&#039;t know why. I should probably look it up on the Tivo Community Forum: http://www.tivocommunity.com. If you don&#039;t know about that site, they have information on using the Tivo with just about any cable provider in the nation.<br /><br />Good luck!<br />-Deborah<br /><br />

				Can anyone tell me if RCN&#039;s internet service is reliable in Astoria? My friend has a small street level office in the area and I witnessed an RCN field supervisor tell my friend that RCN&#039;s internet in Queens stinks. His office was getting a visit every 2 weeks or so involving service interruptions. That was 2 years ago though. <br /><br />Any input is appreciated. I have Time Warner and I feel I pay too much. Luckily, my apartment building is in the process of being wired for RCN. Thanks.&nbsp; &nbsp;
