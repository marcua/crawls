				You should go to Artopolis and speak to Regina.&nbsp; They make outstanding, beautiful cakes.&nbsp; They were on the Food TV Channel.&nbsp; Try them, you won&#039;t be sorry.&nbsp; She is a professional and will taylor make your cake.

For example, Omonia has a shokolatino or some such named concoction, chocolate cake, with chocolate ( what else?) icing, I know it sounds boring but it totally rocks. Then on the other side of the spectrum Artopolis has these little cute personal cakes. For example, the passion fruit mousse will make you crave it more right after you finish it. Their cheesecake is fab. The only difference between the two is the price. Artopolis is a heck of a lot more expensive, plus they&#039;re an artisan style bakery. For that matter I prefer Artopolis because it&#039;s only a few blocks from me.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;Omonia is a bakery with a cafe attached BTW.

				I&#039;m sure you&#039;re looking to keep it local, but in the event that you are interested, the hall we had our reception in (Terrace on the Park) got our cake from a bakery on Mulberry Street.&nbsp; I can&#039;t for the life of me remember the name but the cake was delicious and beautiful to boot!&nbsp; I will try and get the name for you, if you&#039;re interested.

				When my husband and I had our wedding in Chicago, we ordered our wedding cake from a bakery in Chinatown.&nbsp; It was much more affordable than the other bakeries we looked at, and the cake was delicious.&nbsp; It was very light, with fruit in between the layers.&nbsp; The Chinatown bakeries will do really colorful decoration, but we asked for just white frosting.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I don&#039;t have any local recommendations, but I feel like I&#039;ve seen wedding cakes on display in the windows of bakeries in Manhattan Chinatown, around Canal St. - maybe there would be something like this in Flushing too.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think delivery will be a problem.

				The hall is around the queens mall area and I&#039;m not looking at more than $5/serving.&nbsp; I&#039;ll check Omonia and see what I find.&nbsp; A lot of the wedding bakers are charging $10-$15/serving and that&#039;s WAY too much.

				My personal favorite for big-but-not-huge occasions (Mom&#039;s 60th b-day; sister&#039;s bridal shower) is the Cupcake Cafe on the far west side of Manhattan (near the Port Authority.)<br /><br />They&#039;re known for their elaborate flower designs and old-fashioned recipes with a nice variety. The bakery is a real hole-in-the-wall but the cakes speak for themselves. &#039;course for a wedding might be on the pricey side......&nbsp; :|

				I&#039;d recommend Soutine - they are on the UWS, but I don&#039;t know if they travel that far. I&#039;d say that their desserts are by far the best I&#039;ve sampled in NY (aside from Babycakes ;)).

				yeah, well you better give him your arm and leg for a cake.&nbsp; I love Duff Goldman.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been following him for a long time.&nbsp; His cakes are great but are just WAY too expensive.&nbsp; I&#039;m sorry.&nbsp; I just wouldn&#039;t feel right buying a cake that cost over a grand no matter how well it was put together.

				As the groom I didn&#039;t really want to do anything, so my wife made me in charge of getting the cake.&nbsp; Hey, I liked to eat cake, so I thought it was going to be easy.&nbsp; It was actually a pretty long process and I&#039;m glad she didn&#039;t have to deal with it (all this extra work would have made her more of a Bridezilla than she was during the planning stages).&nbsp; <br /><br />Ultimately, I had my wedding cake in 2005 done by Luguli&#039;s Bakery on Ditmars.&nbsp; I decided to go local since I had my wedding at Astoria Manor and didn&#039;t want the cake to get potentially damaged by a long commute.&nbsp; Also, the wedding hall cake (I thought) wasn&#039;t very good.&nbsp; Plus, I even found out that most halls only give your guest a sheet cake, while they wheel out a plastic prop cake for photo&#039;s.&nbsp; An idea I thought was kinda cheesy.<br /><br />The woman who owned Luguli at the time made an incredible cake for us...the bottom layer was made of fresh peaches, then two layers of white vanilla cake over that, with the middle of the two layers made of french vanilla cream and chocolate chips.&nbsp; Everyone loved it (granted, I&#039;m a sugarholic, but who isn&#039;t)!!!<br /><br />But in 2006, the woman sold Luguli back to the original family that owned the bakery.&nbsp; However, for our one year anniversary, I asked them to make a much smaller version of our wedding cake (we weren&#039;t going to freeze a piece as tradition dictates.&nbsp; I found that idea kinda disgusting).&nbsp; Since ours was a custom cake, we showed them a picture of what the woman had produced for the wedding.&nbsp; They replicated it pretty well, though it did taste a little different this time around.&nbsp; Then again, different bakers always produce different results.<br /><br />Matter of fact, the three layer model they have in the window is based on the cake made for my wedding.&nbsp; They had a different cake in the window prior to my &quot;anniversary edition&quot; which they made for me.<br />_____________<br /><br />I also second the endorsement for Artopolis.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had several cakes done for smaller family events and they all came out great.&nbsp; More expensive though, but hey, it&#039;s a wedding.<br /><br />There are a couple of good places in the City that specialize in wedding cakes as well.&nbsp; Yes, they are REALLY expensive but you can&#039;t deny they have a long track record and even more flexibility in designs/offerings than bakeries who produce wedding cakes as a side project.&nbsp; <br /><br />My suggestion is to get a solid number of how many guest you&#039;re going to have (don&#039;t use a range of guest as a guide...get a solid number).&nbsp; This lets you know how big a cake you&#039;ll need and how it will ultimately be designed.&nbsp; Then try out different bakeries; forget about bakeries that say &quot;we can make it however you want&quot;...that means they have no experience with wedding cakes.&nbsp; Wedding shows held at banquet halls throughout the City also let you try out many different bakers (though truth be told, after my wife dragged me to my third one of those, I was done with them...they get repetative and stupid).&nbsp; After you get tired from all the tastings, make your comparisons and when you have two or three bakeries in mind, start the negotiating process.&nbsp; When discussing the price, have them figure out how much the cake will cost per slice and THEN make your decision.&nbsp; This is all going to take some time but then again, the presentation of the cake is probably one of the most memorable parts of the event (how often do you ever hear someone say two years later &quot;hey, those hor devours were fantastic!!&quot;).&nbsp; <br /><br />Skimp on other things...don&#039;t skimp on the cake.

				Wow, thanks for the reply.. It was very informative.&nbsp; I&#039;ll check out La Guli since that is literally up the block from me.&nbsp; Does it make sense to get a cake smaller than the expected amount of people showing up?&nbsp; Not everyone will eat it and they can always cut the servings a little smaller.&nbsp; Soutine on the UWS quoted me $7/serving but I&#039;m sure those are decent sized servings.&nbsp; If I&#039;m expecting 150 people, it may make sense to say 100 are showing, then cut the servings smaller.&nbsp; Since you have experience in this, what do you think?

				My wedding was not &quot;typical&quot; so I couldn&#039;t tell you if that is a good price or not for Soutine. We had our own personal wedding cake and then we had a variety of desserts for our guests. To be honest we really did not like our cake (did not get at Soutine, sadly) - tasted mediocre and looked weird. (We&#039;ve started a tradition for our anniversary that we make or have a dessert that makes up for our crappy wedding cake. :D)<br /><br />Someone else with more experience with larger / more standard weddings should step in and tell you if it is a good price or not. I&#039;ll just vouch for taste. ;)

				I had Artopolis do a sheet cake for an event recently. It was VERY pricey, but totally worth it. They did an amazing job on the design and the cake was really wonderful melt-in-your-mouth tasting. They can do amazing things to cakes-not your traditional cake. Highly recommended. They also threw in fruit tarts for free (believe me, I spent a lot on this cake).&nbsp; Regina is who I dealt with-very professional.

				You definitely shouldn&#039;t give a # less than the # of people you might have come to the wedding. I&#039;ve been to a couple of parties (not weddings) at halls where they actually ran out of food.

While the wedding is about you, <em>everyone</em> should be happy and have enough to eat. There probably should be at least one slice of dessert available for each guest. Of course, we totally overestimated and had WAY too much food. We had cheese squares in our refrigerator for the next couple or three weeks.

				Two suggestions: the Italian bakery on 30th Avenue here in Astoria, it is around 35th Street - starts with a &quot;t&quot;. Old-timers have said it is the best in our hamlet.<br /><br />Also check out www.buttergirlcakes.com, which has samples of wedding and other cakes by NYC pastry chef Jennifer Roach, who works at a top restaurant as their pastry chef. She is the friend of a friend and I have seen and tasted her cakes. Excellent.
