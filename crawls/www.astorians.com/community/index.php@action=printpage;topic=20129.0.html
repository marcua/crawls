				Hello fellow Astorians,<br /><br />Hope you&#039;re all keeping warm out there.&nbsp; Question for you:&nbsp; has anyone personally dealt with a landlord&#039;s request for rent increase due to a MCI (major capital improvement)?<br /><br />I just read up some articles on www.tenants.net and particularly this one via centralastoria.org (http://www.centralastoria.org/columns/mci.htm) which suggests that you can challenge these increases but it is not easy.<br /><br />Basically, our landlord has done repair work to our aging building within the last year.&nbsp; Not so successfully by my estimation -- the roof above my window still leaks every time it rains.&nbsp; Is this really a major capital improvement?&nbsp; I would certainly challenge having my rent increased because of it because it didn&#039;t work from my perspective.&nbsp; But I haven&#039;t got a lot of experience in this department.<br /><br />My neighbor let me know last week to expect a letter from the Division of Housing and Community Renewal and I got it in the mail today.&nbsp; A number of us are going to write back objecting to the rent increase, hopefully a critical mass (I read 51% is necessary).&nbsp; <br /><br />Has anyone been down this road before?&nbsp; Words of wisdom to share?<br /><br />Thanks!

				Just wondering , do you live in a rent controlled building ?&nbsp; Do you have a lease that states no rent being raised for a certain amount of time ?&nbsp; &nbsp;If you dont then i would think the landlord can raise the rent when he seems fit . Maybe he is giving the reason on why he is doing it , with the repairs&nbsp; but that might be just to show tenants some kind of excuse . Who says the rent raises wont equal to much more then he spent in the repairs in the end .&nbsp; &nbsp;Either way&nbsp; if its not rent controlled and no lease then he can raise it when he wants .&nbsp; Its a business afterall .&nbsp; Just threaten to move and see what he says

				Hi hikaruhana<br /><br />Responding to Thanos&#039; point, if you got a notice that your landlord has applied for an MCI, then you&#039;re either rent stabilized or rent controlled (more than likely you&#039;re rent stabilized, but for the purposes of the fighting it the difference is not relevant).<br /><br />To be honest, the vast majority of MCI applications are approved, even those that the tenants fight.&nbsp; That doesn&#039;t mean you shouldn&#039;t do anything about it, because it&#039;s possible to at least get it reduced.&nbsp; The DHCR website (DHCR=Division of Housing and Community Renewal, which is the NYS agency that supervises rent stabilization &amp; rent control) has a lot of good info, starting with their fact sheet on MCIs:<br /><br />http://nysdhcr.gov/Rent/FactSheets/orafac24.pdf (http://nysdhcr.gov/Rent/FactSheets/orafac24.pdf)<br /><br />But fighting an MCI rent increase can really be a lot of work, especially if you&#039;ve never had to deal with anything of the kind before.&nbsp; How big is your building?&nbsp; Maybe you can get a bunch of people together and hire an attorney?&nbsp; If you can&#039;t go that route, post here again and I&#039;ll see if I can give you some pointers, but if you&#039;re truly set on fighting it, I would really suggest using a lawyer.&nbsp; The response will be far more effective if it&#039;s written by an attorney who has experience in dealing with DHCR.&nbsp;

				We&#039;ve had several of those requests over the years. I was worried the first time since it was my first experience. The Landlord changed all the old windows to more efficient ones. Except they were carp. But the rent increase was approved... $1.42 per room per month. So it was $5 more a month. The second was similar because the new owner had to change all those carppy windows the last guy put in. That was similar- $1.80 something per room, per month.<br /><br />It has something to do with how much it is, and how much time he has to pay it off. In our case it was supposed to be spread out over 20 years or some ridiculous number. If I had done it myself, it would have cost <strong>me</strong> approx $1200 to replace the 3 BIG windows and one small bathroom window. Which seem about right overall compared to the rate increase- it worked out to be about the same.

				Hi all and thank you very much for the responses!<br /><br />I do live in a rent stabilized building. Not sure as to the total number of units but it is quite large and there are several tenants here, so I think we have a good chance of registering our objection to this.&nbsp; The people on my floor are pretty organized against it, anyway.&nbsp; You&#039;re right, replan, I&#039;ve never done anything remotely like challenging a MCI rent increase so I must confess I&#039;m a little loath to go the lawyer route here but I would like to contest it provided there was enough momentum with the other tenants.&nbsp; I was afraid that you might say most of these are approved.&nbsp; But here&#039;s hoping we get enough people submitting their feedback to reach critical mass.&nbsp; Thanks for the link to the fact sheet too - that was exactly the type of resource I was looking for.<br /><br />Fingers crossed.&nbsp; I&#039;ll keep you posted.<br /><br />

But if the work was done as you say, incompetently, then <strong>HE</strong> should be fighting the contractor to correct the situation. Any cost of that should then NOT be added to the total MCI increase- the contractor should eat that cost.

				Good Luck<br /><br />Get as many to file against the increase.If you have proof against the increase&nbsp; send it in .Photocopy everything.<br />Send your complaints also by registered mail.<br /><br />I fought an increase and won once upon a time.Our building fought several years ago on a new boiler and lost.The old boiler was old that is all ...<br /><br />I occassionally log to this site to find answers also<br />www.tenant.net<br /><br />remember documentation no matter how little it means to you and your neighbors can mean the increase goes in or not.<br />Best of Luck <br /><br />Cassie

				RayG – while that may make intuitive sense, it’s just not the way MCIs work. There’s a specific procedure set in the Rent Stabilization Code (RSC) as to how they get processed and what the owner has to submit. It’s based on the cost of the capital improvement. And if there are problems with the work, the owner will usually be given the opportunity to correct them.<br /><br />Hikaruhana – RayG makes a really good point: how much is the increase for?&nbsp; On the notice you received, it should give a dollar figure on a per room/per month basis.&nbsp; If in total it winds up being like $5/month more, it may not be worth the effort in fighting.&nbsp; But that’s up to you.<br /><br />You have a clock ticking, so the first thing you’re going to need is more time:&nbsp; on the notice there should be date stamp showing when it was mailed.&nbsp; You have to mail a response back within a certain time frame.&nbsp; I think it’s either 30 or 45 days, but that also should be stated on the notice.&nbsp; In order to pause that clock, you need to give DHCR a reason.&nbsp; So, you’re going to fill out a freedom of information request (FOIL) to get the actual application that your landlord submitted.&nbsp; The form is here:<br /><br />http://nysdhcr.gov/Forms/Rent/foil1.pdf (http://nysdhcr.gov/Forms/Rent/foil1.pdf)<br /><br />Fill out your info up top, check off number 5, and put the docket number (usually on the upper right of the MCI notice) in the blank by “docket/order number”.&nbsp; Also hand write on there somewhere that you’re requesting a copy of the entire MCI application.&nbsp; Make a few copies for yourself, and mail it in as per the instructions on the back.&nbsp; Be sure to include a copy of your lease to prove you’re actually a tenant there, they won’t process it otherwise.&nbsp; Next, write a letter to DHCR at the address on the MCI notice requesting an extension of time to reply until the FOIL request has been processed and you’ve had a chance to review the application.&nbsp; Get as many people in your building as you can to sign the letter, send it via certified return receipt, and include with it a copy of the FOIL request you sent.&nbsp; Depending on how long it takes them to process the FOIL, this is going to buy you somewhere between 2 and 4 months before you have to reply for real.<br /><br />There are a lot more things you can do, but it’s too voluminous for me to post at the moment.&nbsp; Feel free to email or PM me here and I’ll send a bunch more info your way.<br />
