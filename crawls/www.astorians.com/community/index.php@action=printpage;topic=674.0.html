			<dd class="postbody">
				@cabanird<br />Well, I wasn't quite done copying the flyer when the server became inaccessible, but...<br /><br />I can give you my own opinion. I won't speak for the group of Astorians for Peace and Justice as a whole which I just joined, because they might think differently. We are, after all, individuals.<br /><br />My feeling is that whether &quot;a march like this[will] stop the war in iraq&quot; is besides the point. Personally, I don't think it will. I think that the people that hold power are going to do whatever they are doing regardless of what people say or think, even if those very people are responsible for electing them to power (which is also debatable).<br /><br />However, I also believe that not to speak out and show these people that there is indeed dissent and that citizens who oppose the war not only exist but exist in great numbers, would (to my mind) be equivalent to condoning what is being done with not only our tax dollars but our lives.<br /><br />Now, if you are one of those people who support the war, I can enumerate a dozen reasons why this war is wrong and hopefully try to convince you otherwise. Whether or not I succeed is really of no consequence to me however. Everyone has a right to their own opinions, and one thing I have learned is that people don't shed their beliefs so easily. Just like you would be hard pressed to find someone who could easily dissuade me from my own beliefs (which are really just based on feelings anyway). That being said, I sincerely believe in the Bill of Rights,<br />which states (among other things) that [italics mine]:<br /><br />&quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or <em>abridging the freedom of speech</em>, or of the press; or <em>the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances</em>.&quot;<br /><br />That's the First Amendment to the Constitution, btw.<br />And, it is also a pet belief of mine that unless specific freedoms are excercised then they are in danger of atrophy and being lost. I thought that everybody knew this.<br /><br />Please keep in mind that assembling &quot;peaceably&quot; is important. When people get all confrontational it tends to hurt the very cause they're supposedly representing and hurts the other people who are serious about what they are doing and who are doing it right; that is, in a respectful, well thought-out, even creative manner. This is not to say that people cannot express their anger. Mature people can express their anger or even outright rage in a way that is both civilized and unhurtful. That is what democracy is founded upon, i.e. people expressing themselves without fear of retribution.<br /><br />I am reminded of what happened in Tiananmen Square not so long ago. Those students who lost their lives during that protest were <em>not</em> living in a democracy. And yet they were willing to stand up for what they believed (in this case freedom) even if they lost their lives while doing it. I think many young Americans today should think about this and what it means to live in a democracy, and to not take this freedom that we enjoy so much for granted. Not taking things for granted implies excercising these rights or at least being mindful of what we stand to loose, which is much.<br /><br />So back to the original question. How will a march like this end the war in Iraq?<br />Answer: It may not end the war on it's own. In fact, I highly doubt it. But it may become a small start. It may inspire other people to do the same. It may force people who are pro-war if not to re-evaluate their own beliefs to at least recognize that an opposing view exists, and that <em>in great numbers</em>. &nbsp;And with some luck and perseverance a movement for peace will be born where the overwhelming sentiment of the populace will be so vast that even the people who sit at the top of the pinnacles of power will have to come to recognize it.<br />Never underestimate the power that public approval or disapproval holds for a politician, even in dictatorships.<br /><br />Did that answer your question? Or were you just baiting me? :-)<br />----zeno.

				I can't agree with you more. This administration imho really sucks eggs.<br />To tell you the truth, I can't really tell you how effective the anti-war culture was on the final resolution of the Vietnamese &quot;conflict&quot;, and that's what we're stuck with, another Vietnam. I have to believe that the size of the movement had an effect, over the <span class="bbc_u">years</span> no matter how small. Vietnam was not a &quot;popular&quot; war. I believe that this did effect the decision to &quot;pull out&quot;.<br /><br />What scares me, is that this war <em>may</em> have popular support, or at least a divided nation's popular support. Iow, we may well be on our way (if not already) to becoming a &quot;fascist&quot; nation, in every sense of the word. Freedoms are not easily won, nor are they easily maintained. You are completely right in stating that one more protest won't make a difference. But to contradict you, I think it does make a difference, maybe very small, but a significant difference nonethless. Things may not change with protest, but do you think it right to keep silent, no matter how futile it may seem? Giving up and bowing down is not in the spirit of a solution. And yea, voting helps, well... as long as the counters of the votes are not corrupted (which they were). Hell, we'll protest that too.:roll: <br /><br />Wearing t-shirts? That helps too.<br /><br />http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/Northeast/03/04/iraq.usa.shirt.reut/<br /><br />I guess the more of us who wear them the harder it will be for them to arrest us. Sometimes the direct results of what we do are not always immediately apparent.<br /><br />My whole point is, is that the people who are in power now; and this goes beyond the whole Republican vs. Democrat charade, got to be where they are through years, no <em>decades</em> of planning and work. They were patient, they believed, they knew that the average American would only fight so hard for so long because in their estimation the average American was lazy and decadent, even disinterested, caring for nothing except immediate temporary pleasures with no empathy to a world outside their own small existence. That is how they view <em>us</em>. And it only stands to reason that if this is the message that is pummeled into our heads since birth that we will except this about ourselves, in effect we will have become <em>our own police</em>.<br /><br />But, and I ask <em>you</em> now: Do you really believe that the human spirit is so easily won over? Do you really believe that with all that is known about technology, science, marketing and psychology that these &quot;experts&quot; have figured out what makes the human tick? The human mind and spirit (yes, I am Agnostic) is unfathomable to the human brain, just as it is impossible for an eye to percieve itself except maybe through some distorted and imperfect lense. If one studies one of these lenses which we call &quot;history&quot;, one can get an inkling of just how barbarous and wonderful the human species really is. We can put a man on the moon but we can't feed our children. We can put a microchip on the head of a pin or split the atom, but at the same time we use this knowledge to take out a city of 80,000 people in one fell swoop. One sees over and over again this reoccurring theme, even in our stories &amp; myths, this eternal battle between Good versus Evil, empathy vs. apathy, the light of knowledge vs. the darkness of ignorance which rages even within our own hearts every time we speak, act or even think.<br /><br />In my estimation, there is no quick and easy solution. The harder the fight, the greater the reward. I am reminded of that old Roman saying, &quot;Fortune favours the brave&quot; or &quot;So a man soughs, so shall he reap&quot;.<br />&quot;Freedom&quot; (to me) is the allegorical &quot;Pearl of Great Price&quot; that is only bought with everything one has and not a penny less. How can <em>that</em> be bought by wearing a t-shirt or showing up for a few protests.<br />I admire you cabanird but let me remind you that:<br />&quot;Evil doth not sleep.&quot;<br /><br />(I'm probably going to regret sending off this post without re-reading it first, but what the hell, I'm tired I-O), yours sincerely,<br />----zeno

				i'm not denying that saying what you feel or being able to use our freedom of speech is a good thing.<br /><br />i know that it is an excellent thing.<br /><br />this cindy sheehan thing is gathering a lot of media coverage. <br /><br />but so what?<br /><br />it doesnt do anything.<br />our little Pres is just scowling and beign stubborn, holding is ground and not saying anything to her. as will the rest of the administration. <br /><br />and they will do the same about our protests.<br /><br />i do agree, our protests make us feel warm and yummy inside. but it really doesnt accomplish anything.<br /><br />writing a letter/email of protest to our representatives and senators every day might.<br /><br />i really liked that whole 'let's clog everybody's email/phones, etc' thing that happened a while back.<br /><br />that hits it where it needs to hit it.<br />the people who represent us, and have a lot of the power, the people who beg us for their votes.<br /><br />taking a vote away from a candidate/rep/senator really hurts them and they will listen up to that.

				Again, I agree with everything you're saying except for one or two points. You say &quot;it doesn't do anything&quot;. I have to disagree on theoretical grounds.<br />What Sheehan is doing <em>does</em> make a difference, and she's becoming a real thorn in the ass of the President himself. That I believe.<br /><br />And as far as feeling &quot;warm and yummy inside&quot; I find nothing about civil disobedience that is warm or yummy. Quite the opposite in fact. Armies of men dressed like stormtroopers right out of Star Wars with batons, stun guns, tear gas, auto and semiautomatic weapons, <em>sound</em> devices and soon to be <em>lightning guns</em>. Not to mention the very real threat of being arrested (or worse) which is far from being a picnic. <br /><br />Protest is one instrument among many, doing what we're doing right now is another (communicating). By not speaking to Sheean the president is making it worse for himself (in his eyes, our eyes and in the eyes of the World), because no matter what he wants to believe, she <em>does</em> exist and so do the thousands of people that are rallying behind her cause, <em>our</em> cause. I saw Sheehan speak on &quot;Real Time&quot; last night, and she <em>is</em> optimistic. The Republicans in power now are entrenched but they are not gods, nor is their power unshakable.<br />Do you remember the Million Man March? I defy you to tell me that that event didn't have an effect. Maybe not the effect desired but to say it was all for nothing is I believe inaccurate.<br /><br />I'm really enjoying this dialogue and I wish to continue it but may I direct your attention to the &quot;Hurricane Katrina&quot; topic on this board. Being wrapped up in my own things for the last couple of days I failed to realize until an hour ago how utterly devastating this event is. In fact I'm also kind of worried on a personal level as well. Let's keep this discussion going!<br /><br />Yours truly,<br />----zeno.

				<strong>zeno</strong>, I encourage your efforts to protest the war in Iraq, but to draw parallels to Vietnam is over simplifying, at best. The political shorthand at the moment is to say it's 'another Vietnam quagmire' but the fact is Iraq is about as different as Vietnam apples are to stereos.<br /><br />You want your efforts to fail? Then keep bringing up Vietnam. I'm serious.<br /><br />I say this b/c I feel that it's absolutely essential for US citizens to question why this war happened, what the role of our country should be in the world, what constitutes national interests, and so forth. However, the legacy of Vietnam is a huge controversy that's highly, highly partisan. For this war, we need to depoliticize it as much as possible if there's ever going to be a resolution that's truly in the best interests of this country.<br /><br />And I'm sorry but Cindy Sheehan is in this for political reasons, not just personal. She should have respected what her son (who was an adult) choose to do for a living. He volunteered, plain and simple. What she's doing is letting the cat out of her long-simmering lefty political bag to score points against her Enemy Number One, as personified in GWB.<br /><br />Her protests, or whatever they are, are all about her. They're about <strong>her</strong> loss, <strong>her</strong> victimhood, <strong>her</strong> own grudges against conservatism, the military, war, whatever.<br /><br />Now, if you told me that she was a Republican who voted twice for Bush and is still doing her thing, then OK, that's someone I want to listen to. Right now, only about half of the country wants to listen to her. I believe the rest just wishes she shuts the hell up. And it's not b/c she's 'speaking the truth'. It's because she comes across as partisan -- what Republican is going to care what she says? And let's be honest, we're in a 50/50 nation.<br /><br />The alternative? Redefine what it means <strong>today</strong> to be opposed to the war in Iraq. Not that it's 'another Vietnam'. Not 'if you're Republican you have to be for it, Democrat so you have to be against it.'<br /><br />And for God's sake, no more smarmy attitudes toward those citizens who <strong>volunteer</strong> to join the military. They're not 'stupid' or 'foolish'. They're not being 'tricked'. They are not idiots or simpletons or rednecks. Yet this is what's implied among some in the anti-war camp. The rampant anti-military bias isn't going to score points among the majority of people in this country.<br /><br />In fact, the partisanship exhibited by this United for Peace and Justice org you link to isn't helping either. I know it says it's 'non-partisan' but yet they go on and on lambasting the 'right-wing agenda'. So that means they must be left wing. Case in point:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">This military strategy brutally reinforces the empire-building agenda of corporate<br />globalization, which uses “free trade” policies to concentrate power and wealth in the hands of a few by attacking labor and environmental protections, reducing governments’ control over their country’s economies, and slashing public services.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Yada yada yada yada -- the typical left-wing litanies. Sure, no partisanship there -- please. :roll: And what a perfect way to alienate a major chunk of the population.<br /><br />I'm not telling you what to believe, of course. Just don't be surprised when people like me who oppose the war in Iraq don't want anything to do with the UFPJ or its supporters.

				working on no sleep and I thought I had escaped from this discussion for the moment :-) &nbsp; ....one-more cof-fe-e---ahh..<br /><br />Neverthless, let me say that I am overjoyed at the rapidity as well as the <br />diversity of the responses that this topic has gotten. I seriously thought that last night I would be copying a flyer to put on the calendar and that would be that! I am really quite surprised. I wish the topics on the board concerning the USA PATRIOT Act got such immediate and heated reaction, (Another thing I don't pretend to really understand, not being a lawyer or a congressman).<br /><br />First things first:<br />@daveed<br />I must admit that you are correct in stating that to compare the war in Iraq to Vietnam would be gross oversimplification, and I appreciate the advice you gave me concerning it. I have no wish to alienate people that would normally be on the side of anti-war (in this case, Iraq). Please be aware though that I don't necessarily stand against all wars. Wars are terrible but sometimes (I feel) necessary,e.g. World War II, Bosnia and Herzegovina, how about a campaign to stop the genocide in Darfur? I would personally have no problem with that.<br /><br />Perhaps the parallels that I perceived between Vietnam (which was before my time) and the current conflict stem from a few simplistic beliefs that I hold about both wars, and again let me reiterate that I really don't pretend to know that much about either one of them (I am arguing more from mere <em>feelings</em> here than facts, which I know is a dangerous place to argue from at the risk of being misinformed and unobjective) to be completely honest, but here goes and I apologize again for beating a dead horse:<br /><br />1) I believe that both the war in Vietnam and the war in Iraq to be motivated by greed rather than &quot;national security&quot; or any real threat. I believe both wars to be about control of precious resources under the pretext of fighting something else, that is &quot;Communism&quot; on the one hand and &quot;fundamental Islamic terrorists&quot; on the other; both reasons being ideological in nature. Or perhaps this difference in ideology is what serves as a righteous justification and fuel for bloodshed.<br />Both wars eventually came to be (at least, this is what we're told) about <span class="bbc_u">Spreading Democracy</span>. That was the excuse.<br /><br />2) I believe that the war in Iraq will go on for just as long (if not longer) as the war in Vietnam and I also believe (and you can quote me on this) that there is a very real danger that the draft will be reinstated due to a lack of &quot;volunteers&quot;. I realize that many violently disagree with me upon this point, but there it is.<br /><br />3) In both wars we see a wholesale resistence on the part of the people. I believe there was a very large percentage of people in South Vietnam that <em>wanted</em> Communism. I may be wrong about that, but from what I've read and heard, I don't think so. But I am fairly sure that the majority of Iraqis do <em>not</em> welcome us there. Both were labeled &quot;insurgents&quot;.<br /><br />4) I believe that both wars were and are grossly expensive in terms of monetary value, too expensive for &quot;we the people&quot; to afford.<br />I like this link for students grades 9-12:<br />http://www.globaled.org/curriculum/viet.html<br />http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/modules/vietnam/index.cfm<br />&amp;<br />http://washingtontimes.com/upi-breaking/20040701-024236-4063r.htm<br />and last but not least from a highly partisan website:<br />http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0908-01.htm<br />I, for one am more prone to calculate the human costs. Not because I believe myself to be &quot;ethical&quot; but because grief and loss I can understand, the Economy I cannot. $-)<br /><br />5) Both wars used and are using chemicals that are dangerous to our soldiers even if they never see any &quot;action&quot;. Agent orange on the one hand, DU or Depleted Uranium on the other, among other things. Not to mention the health risks that these impose on the native populations (as if that really mattered). I'm being facetious here.<br /><br />Let me take a moment here to dispel what I percieve to be a highly inaccurate statement. I quote &quot;However, the legacy of Vietnam is a huge controversy that's highly, highly partisan.&quot; <br />Well, I agree that it's highly controversial, but I do not believe that it is highly partisan. John F. Kennedy was a Democrat I believe, and Richard M. Nixon... wasn't he a Republican? Also (in regard to this war) Didn't John Kerry say he was in <em>support</em> of the war in Iraq? Well, on a personal note I can assure you that I <em>am</em> non-partisan, though I also tend to believe in nutty conspiracy theories and the unaccountability of &quot;Big Businesses around the Globe.&quot;<br /><br />Let me also (for the moment) defend Astorians for Peace and Justice, though I cannot speak for the larger body (which frankly I haven't had the time to peruse their propaganda). The group that I joined is very small, consists of very nice people, and they are <em>doing</em> something, just like you and I are doing something right now by simply speaking about the topic. They're taking a stand amidst a culture that I believe is more preoccupied by Seinfeld than the atrocities that are being committed in the name of OIL (that is Operation Iraqi Freedom, no seriously, that was the name). Now when I say &quot;atrocities&quot; I am not derailing the United States exclusively. Well, for example, do you remember this?:<br />&lt;cheap shot coming; not for the squeamish&gt;<br />http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4646406<br /><br />By all accounts the Marine was in heavy combat and was even shot the day before, see? atrocities on both sides. One amongst many. Violence breeding yet more violence; what I believe All Wars have in common.<br /><br />And now I challenge you on the partisan issue. Ask ten (10) registered Republicans where they stand on the war. Pose the same question to any ten (10) Democrats. Now tell me the result. I really want to know.<br /><br />The problem with the Left (as I see it; again falling into tiresome cliches) is that the Left is splintered and divided where Republicans show (IMHO) a unified front. More power to them. So while I may not agree with the rhetoric of United for Peace and Justice, we can agree on <span class="bbc_u">one thing</span>, and that is: This war is wrong, we need either to finish it now or get out. The reasons why and wherefore it started or understanding the <br />logistics on the survivability of democracy in that country holds no interest for me whatsoever, just as I really don't need to be an automotive engineer to drive a car, or understand Boyle's Law every time I turn on the stove.<br />I want them (the troops) out and they (UFP&amp;J) want them out too. Do we have to agree on everytyhing or <em>anything</em> else? No, just that one thing.<br /><br />If you see a better alternative or a group that really <em>is</em> non-partisan or non-politicized but is against the war, please let me know. And here I'm not being facetious. I would really like to get in touch with such a group.<br /><br />One final parallel, (I'm not even going to touch Sheean or the questionable self-determination of the troops). :-) Here goes:<br /><br />6) It is my firm belief that both the war in Vietnam and the war in Iraq as well as many other wars throughout human history that we can indeed compare with each other and hopefully learn from, are both long, drawn out, wars of attrition, paid for by the taxpayer that can be ill afforded to benefit the few, and are based on lies. I again reiterate at the risk of being redundant for cheesey dramatic effect :-). <strong>Lies</strong>.<br /><br />Respectfully yours,<br />----zeno.<br /><br />Now <em>I'm</em> going to sleep. Shall we continue tomorrow? ;-)

				Be sure to not watch the protest on T.V.<br />I've been flipping through every channel for the last hour, and I saw one (1) reference to it (briefly). No live coverage, no commentary, no nothing.<br />Are thousands of people assembling in front of the White House not newsworthy? Oh, I did see a piece on Donald Trump. I guess that's newsworthy, not entertainment at all. Fox: <em>Paid Programming</em> 12.30-1pm. NBC: Golf. ABC: College Football. <em>CSPAN-2</em> [!]: <strong><span class="bbc_u">Book tv</span></strong>, CNN: Galveston, category 3 (I really believe the newspeople are disappointed). WNET: Caucus, NJ (well, that's a start)...and more commercials than &quot;programming&quot;.<br />By this live example I can see before my eyes in real time that American Freedom of the Press is not what it's cracked up to be.<br /><br />Well, just because events aren't being covered, doesn't mean that nothing is going on. From this I take heart (and it will be shown on BBC and Canadian television). I guess it will fall to the independent media (and the American people) to once again do the job themselves.<br /><br />---zen (content free)

				WBAI - the laughing stock of the American political left!<br />During the past few weeks hardly a peep of program material or public service announcements plugging this march! &nbsp;This from a radio station and network (Pacifica) that has promotion of peace and justice in it's bylaws. &nbsp;But you wait! &nbsp;The Millions More march that the Rev. Farrikan and the NOI are organizing will be mentioned every moment by WBAI's racialistic staff.<br /><br />Pacifica and BAI only covers antiwar activities out of a cynical and nostalgic motive regarding it's aging and rapidly dwindling listenership.<br /><br />Oh, and hellow to this board.

				@ cannibal: Well, it's true WBAI is not what it used to be, but where are the alternatives?<br />Who has covered the protest <em>at all</em>? I must admit that I haven't listened to radio much today, but they were the only ones (that I heard) that had live coverage of a newsworthy event. If I was watching t.v. exclusively then I doubt I would even know that a protest took place, and I was paying close attention today.<br /><br />You are correct in stating that racism works both ways, but I think that you may be a little too harsh toward the staff of this public radio station. There are many open minded individuals from many different backgrounds working there. While it's true that it is a leftist station, it is far outnumbered by stations on the right. I'm not sure what I think of their policies however, but I do remember some problems that they had with Pacifica a few years back. I'm not so sure that Pacifica itself is not all it's made out to be.<br /><br />Can you post a list of alternatives? I think that many of us would be interested.<br /><br />And welcome to the board! :-)<br /><br />----zeno.

No live coverage, no commentary, no nothing.<br />Are thousands of people assembling in front of the White House not newsworthy? </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />This is from FAIR (Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting), and is appropriate to this aspect of the thread:<br /><br /><strong>Media Advisory</strong><br />http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=2677<br /><br /><strong>Disappearing Antiwar Protests<br />Media shrug off mass movement against war<br /></strong><br />9/27/05<br /><br />Hundreds of thousands of Americans around the country protested the Iraq War on the weekend of September 24-25, with the largest demonstration bringing between 100,000 and 300,000 to Washington, D.C. on Saturday.<br /><br />But if you relied on television for your news, you'd hardly know the protests happened at all. According to the Nexis news database, the only mention on the network newscasts that Saturday came on the NBC Nightly News, where the massive march received all of 87 words. (ABC World News Tonight transcripts were not available for September 24, possibly due to pre-emption by college football.)<br /><br />Cable coverage wasn't much better. CNN, for example, made only passing references to the weekend protests. CNN anchor Aaron Brown offered an interesting explanation (9/24/05):<br /><br />&quot;There was a huge 100,000 people in Washington protesting the war in Iraq today, and I sometimes today feel like I've heard from all 100,000 upset that they did not get any coverage, and it's true they didn't get any coverage. Many of them see conspiracy. I assure you there is none, but it's just the national story today and the national conversation today is the hurricane that put millions and millions of people at risk, and it's just kind of an accident of bad timing, and I know that won't satisfy anyone but that's the truth of it.&quot;<br /><br />To hear Brown tell it, a 24-hour cable news channel is somehow unable to cover more than one story at a time-- and the &quot;national conversation&quot; is something that CNN just listens in on, rather than helping to determine through its coverage choices.<br /><br />The following day (9/25/05), the network's Sunday morning shows had an opportunity to at least reflect on the significance of the anti-war movement. With a panel consisting of three New York Times columnists, Tim Russert mentioned the march briefly in one question to Maureen Dowd-- which ended up being about how the antiwar movement might affect Hillary Rodham Clinton's presidential chances.<br /><br />On ABC's This Week, host George Stephanopoulos observed, &quot;We've seen polls across the board suggesting that we're bogged down now in Iraq and now you have this growing protest movement. Do you believe that we're reaching a tipping point in public opinion?&quot; That question was put to pro-war Republican Sen. John McCain, who responded by inaccurately claiming: &quot;Most polls I see, that most Americans believe still that we have to stay the course.... I certainly understand the dissatisfaction of the American people but I think most of them still want to stay the course and we have to.&quot;<br /><br />A recent CBS/New York Times poll (9/9-13/05) found 52 percent support for leaving Iraq &quot;as soon as possible.&quot; A similar Gallup poll [9/16-18] found that 33 percent of the public want some troops withdrawn, with another 30 percent wanting all the troops withdrawn. Only 34 percent wanted to maintain or increase troop levels--positions that could be described as wanting to &quot;stay the course.&quot; Stephanopoulos, however, failed to challenge McCain's false claim.<br /><br />(An L.A. Times recap of the protests--9/25/05-- included a misleading reference to the Gallup poll, reporting that while the war is seen as a &quot;mistake&quot; by 59 percent of respondents, &quot;There remains, however, widespread disagreement about the best solution. The same poll showed that 30 percent of Americans favored a total troop withdrawal, though 26 percent favored maintaining the current level.&quot; By leaving out the 33 percent of those polled who wanted to decrease troop numbers, the paper gave a misleading impression of closely divided opinion.)<br /><br />On Fox News Sunday (9/25/05), panelist Juan Williams was rebuked by his colleagues when he noted that public opinion had turned in favor of pulling out of Iraq. Fellow Fox panelist and NPR reporter Mara Liasson responded, &quot;Oh, I don't think that's true,&quot; a sentiment echoed by Fox panelist Brit Hume. When Williams brought up the Saudi foreign minister's statement that foreign troops were not helping to stabilize Iraq, panelist William Kristol retorted: &quot;So now the American left is with the House of Saud.&quot; (That was, if anything, a more complimentary take on the protesters than was found in Fox's news reporting, when White House correspondent Jim Angle-- 9/26/05-- referred to them as &quot;disparate groups united by their hatred of President Bush, in particular, and U.S. policies in general.&quot;)<br /><br />Another feature of the protest coverage was a tendency to treat a tiny group of pro-war hecklers as somehow equivalent to the massive anti-war gathering. NBC's Today show (9/25/05) had a report that gave a sentence to each: &quot;Opponents and supporters of the war marched in cities across the nation on Saturday. In the nation's capital an estimated 100,000 war protestors marched near the White House. A few hundreds supporters of the war lined the route in a counterdemonstration.&quot;<br /><br />Reports on NBC Nightly News and CBS Sunday Morning were similarly &quot;balanced,&quot; and a September 26 USA Today report gave nearly equal space to the counter-demonstrators and their concerns, though the paper reported that their pro-war rally attracted just 400 participants (that is, less than half of 1 percent of the number of antiwar marchers).<br /><br />In a headline that summed up the absurdity of this type of coverage, the Washington Post reported (9/25/05): &quot;Smaller but Spirited Crowd Protests Antiwar March; More Than 200 Say They Represent Majority.&quot; Perhaps this &quot;crowd&quot; felt that way because they've grown accustomed to a media system that so frequently echoes their views, while keeping antiwar voices--representing the actual majority opinion--off the radar.<br />--------<br />Feel free to respond to FAIR (fair@fair.org ).
