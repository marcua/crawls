				Walked by your place yesterday with my 7 year (going on 20) old girl and she wanted to go in.&nbsp; I see you have great drink specials for happy hour....is it okay to come in with a well-behaved little grown-up type kid? She will not be drinking lol - I&#039;m sure she can find something good to eat.<br /><br />
