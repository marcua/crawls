				I cannot deny Watawa&#039;s good sushi.&nbsp; It&#039;s usually where my family and I go to eat sushi locally.&nbsp; However, after last night&#039;s debacle I will no longer spend my money here.&nbsp; Here&#039;s my rant....<br /><br />We decided to go to Watawa last night for dinner.&nbsp; We got to the door around 8:20.&nbsp; There were three women managing the front and we were told that it would be a 20 minute wait....we waited......we had a large party..five...large for this restaurant...waiting for 20 minutes is not bad.&nbsp; It was a nice night out and it looked like Ditmars was having a good night.&nbsp; Of course, Taverna Kyclades had their usual line, and tonight it was extraordinarily long.&nbsp; Like many who waited for a table we speculated on which tables might free up for us to sit down.&nbsp; They had tables outside so that they can accommodate more patrons than usual.&nbsp; After 25 minutes, tables are finally clearing.&nbsp; While we waited, more people came to the restaurant.&nbsp; Mostly parties of 2 and a party of three.&nbsp; There were two adjacent tables for 2 that were clearing so I go inside and ask if we can have those tables and just bring out another chair.&nbsp; They emphatically said OK...after another 5 minutes, one table has been cleaned and the other one was paying their check.&nbsp; I was psyched that we were going to get some good sushi in a few minutes.&nbsp; To my disappointment, they sat two people who came after us on the table that was just cleaned.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am a very patient person and will give people the benefit of the doubt...so I assumed that a table must&#039;ve opened up inside to accomodate us.&nbsp; &nbsp;I went inside to inquire why the table outside was given to someone else instead of our party after I spoke with them.&nbsp; Their excuse was that they did not have an extra chair.&nbsp; This excuse should have clued me in to what happened with the rest of the evening...but like I said I am very patient...We waited some more and finally one of the larger tables inside enough to accomodate us was getting cleaned up.&nbsp; At this point, every party who came in after us has been seated except for the party of three.&nbsp; The next move by the restaurant baffled me...they sat the table for three (btw, I saw the look of one of the person in that party, they looked surprise that they were seated first)!&nbsp; At this point, I am waiting for someone from the restaurant to come out and give us some reassurance that they will be sitting us soon....5 minutes come...nada!&nbsp; It&#039;s now 9PM...now I am thinking of all the times that I&#039;ve eaten here and give 25%+ tips every time...I go back into the restaurant and asked politely why the party of three was seated before we were...the manager&#039;s excuse...they did not have an extra chair and that they are just waiting for another table in the back to free up....I patiently walk outside...but after 5 minutes I thought about it some more and told my family we are leaving.&nbsp; Before I leave, I go back in and told the manager about how disappointmented I was of their mistreatment of the situation and that not having an extra chair is inexcusable when they have a bar where they can get the extra chair from, but instead sat a party of one before us...that they sat a party of 3 before us and others who came in 15 minutes after we did.&nbsp; I also told them that I will no longer partronize the restaurant.&nbsp; With that said, all I got was a blank stare.&nbsp; Ugh!&nbsp; You don&#039;t tell someone 20 minutes and make them wait 40 minutes and not once make an effort to explain what is going on.<br /><br />We decided to go to Wave Thai instead.&nbsp; We lucked out and it wasn&#039;t busy.&nbsp; I was a little apprehensive that Wave Thai may have &quot;gone downhill&#039; from some of the posts here.&nbsp; I am happy to report that it has not.&nbsp; Peter (the owner) was there and greeted us.&nbsp; We got our food quickly and it was great!<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if my situation is unique or not.&nbsp; The restaurant is good for small parties (2) and has undeniably has some of the best sushi in this area but it does not excuse our mistreatment.&nbsp; Service for me is a huge factor in a good restaurant.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Thanks for the tip...I&#039;ll try it on my next sushi dinner.&nbsp; My family has since been going to Tokyo I.&nbsp; It&#039;s walking distance from us and even though the sushi is just average, their service is great.<br /><br />On a side note, last weekend we were in the city and wanted to try a place called Sakae Sushi.&nbsp; The midtown location was close so we hike down to the west village for their new location.&nbsp; This has to be the worst experience we&#039;ve had in a restaurant.&nbsp; We ordered salmon sushi and the fish was clearly not fresh...it had a dark orange color and smelled like awful.&nbsp; Any experienced sushi chef would&#039;ve spot this.&nbsp; But in this place, they actually tried to serve it.&nbsp; We sent it back.&nbsp; We also tried one of their kid dishes that is served in a dish shaped like a fire engine.&nbsp; We must&#039;ve waited 30 minutes for this dish to come out.&nbsp; When we asked the waiter what happened to the dish, he says that we ran out of ham.&nbsp; Upon hearing this, I thought to myself, what were they doing this whole time?&nbsp; Did they send someone out to buy ham from a deli and was waiting for it?&nbsp; Again, any experienced kitchen would&#039;ve just asked the patron to either change the order.&nbsp; We also ordered some eel sushi.&nbsp; It was served to us cold.&nbsp; This dish is supposed to be served warm.<br /><br />This place must be fairly new....it was early Sunday night....my mistake for not leaving after seeing only about two patrons in the place at 7PM on a Sunday.&nbsp; In any case, I don&#039;t think we&#039;ll be going back.

				If you are looking for insane omasake try SUSHI SEKI on 63rd and 1st. They are open til 5am on fridays and saturdays and are generally swarmed with japanese businessmen and locals. reservations are suggested and it is some of hte best sushi I&#039;ve ever had. not cheap but worth every penny.

				I don&#039;t blame for you refusing to go there again. I hate when restuarant service is bad..... I would rather have the food be mediocre and the service be fantastic than have good food with atrocious service. I think of going out to eat as a special weekly to bi-weekly occassion, and I want to at least be traited fairly and with respect. <br /><br />Any restaurant that cannot do that does not deserve your money. I have been to Watawa and I enjoyed it, but if I had the same experience as you I would never go there again either.<br /><br />There are hundreds of wonderful places to eat in Ditmars, you won&#039;t miss Watawa too much.<br /><br />-Andrew

				Wow.&nbsp; I am utterly appalled.&nbsp; I have eaten at Watawa once.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know why I even bothered.&nbsp; I always get my sushi in Astoria at JJ&#039;s.&nbsp; Its right at 37th street and 31st Ave.&nbsp; Granted its a little farther from Ditmars, but you&#039;ll spend half as much as you would at Watawa and the fish is better.&nbsp; I am sashimi eater, so I am intensely attentive to the quality and freshness of the fish.&nbsp; Watawa had decent fish, but JJs is way better, has a better atmosphere, is much cheaper and the staff treat you like a noble guest.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t be more enthusiastic about recommending JJ&#039;s.&nbsp; Its worth the cab ride, you&#039;ll pay for the cab twice over in sushi savings.&nbsp;<br />Better luck on your next sushi outting!<br />

				I noticed, couldn&#039;t avoid it really , that Watawa has a sidewalk cafe that now occupies fully half the available sidewalk !!!!! I also see that they have/had prominently displayed the permit for the sidewalk cafe...

				bstewart, I wan&#039;t saying I was appalled that someone ate at watawa... I meant that I was appalled at the terrible experience that was endured.&nbsp; I see how you could misinterpret that, though.&nbsp; Now that I go back and read it, its not clear.<br />

				What made me stop going is when whoever is in charge now decided that it was okay to fill up a glass with coke and not bring a whole can to the table anymore but still charge the same for it!<br /><br />I&#039;m so over that place, and their music drives me nuts.

				I was a regular since they opened. Now, I stopped going because they are putting less fish and charging the same price. Sometimes, the sushi rolls look like they just threw them on a plate.&nbsp; Most of the sushi rolls are getting smaller and smaller. For the price they are charging - it&#039;s no longer the place that it used to be. I rather go to Sakura two blocks away.

				I tried Watawa for the first time last week and thought it was just o.k.&nbsp; The pricing is about average for sushi, but I was a bit unpleased when I was told that smoked salmon would cost $1 more in my philly roll that fresh salmon.&nbsp; Yet on the sushi/sashimi menu the two items cost exactly the same.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never been charged for such a substitution and I always find it odd when a local place like this would nickel and dime their customers.&nbsp; From a business standpoint it just makes no sense.&nbsp; Now they&#039;ve annoyed a local would-be long time customer over $1.&nbsp; But I was over it and hopped my sushi would make up for the poor service.<br />It was o.k. but I was really unpleased with my eel/cucumber roll.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t even find the eel in there.&nbsp; There was lots of Cucumber but it should be all about the fish.&nbsp; &nbsp;My fresh salmon negiri was good, but not a thick enough piece of fish for me.&nbsp; My tekkamaki roll was the best item I got.<br /><br />I&#039;ll try Sakura or some of the other local reccomendations next time.
