				The below note is cut and pasted from an email thread regarding the new CSA opening in mid-southern Astoria (name still TBD). To register to the email thread go to the Hellgate CSA website to sign up (until the new CSA gets set up)<br /><br />Hello everyone.<br />The meeting tonight was small (with three of us in attendance plus Paula, our Just Food rep) but very positive in many respects. The two biggest news items on the table:<br /><br />1) *We have a farm!*<br />Golden Earthworm Farm (GEF) in Jamesport, Long Island: http://www.goldenearthworm.com/<br /><br />2) *We have a location!*<br />The manager at Cafe Bar is psyched to let us set up shop there. (She also wants to nab up a couple shares for the restaurant.) She&#39;s giving us outdoor space with an awning/ table. This was one of the locations we were thinking about from the last meeting and is fairly central to both the N/W and R/V subway locations. They also would have plenty of room for storage.<br /><br />*Other items we discussed:*<br />* Shares will probably be around *$475*, determined by the farm (this is a larger share in terms of qty and price than the current Hellgate share). We can discuss split shares with the farm at our next meeting (see below). There are other options we have in terms of splitting shares ourselves (which has the potential to be a lot of work) or offering signers the possibility of split shares (if others are looking).<br /><br />* Share drop will probably be *Thursdays*, time TBD by us. 4-7 or 8 seems to work best for most people.<br /><br />*Meat/ Dairy/ Fruit &quot;Shares&quot;* There is a possibility of having a &quot;meat man&quot; come by every week, or every other week and sell (as opposed to signing up pre-season) is an option. This goes double for a dairy (cheese/ milk) person (honey??). Fruit shares are a little controversial. Apparently fruit is very difficult in this area to get organic. The current fruit person GEF hooks up with is a low sprayer, sustainable, but not fully organic. Fruit definitely attracts people though.<br /><br />*Next Meeting:*<br />Paula is speaking with GEF regarding a meeting date and will let us know in a few days what works for them. Our next step is to meet them, discuss share sizes, dates, exact share price, season length, possibly winter share options, payment options, any outstanding questions, etc. This will probably happen *mid-Feb*.<br /><br />From there, everything will be much more solid and we can create brochures, membership forms and push recruitment in March. Drops will begin June. Paula does not think membership will be an issue for us so that&#39;s great.<br /><br />We discussed outreach options for membership, like a potluck, or a future meeting with the farmers, for people to come, register, get excited.<br /><br />*Administrative Extras:*<br />1) *Possibly most important:* Core Members. Who wants to be considered a core member, what do you want your role to be? This will become more important as we roll forward. Possible positions: director, distro manager, finance, communications (brochure/ design/ website/ newsletters), outreach/ community / event relations, volunteer / share organizer.<br /><br />2) *We need a name*. Easy to remember, tells something about the location, something that will look good branded on our website, brochures, etc.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;I think that&#39;s it. Anyone there let me know if I forgot something... Personal comments/ responses tk...

				Below is the roundup from the last meeting. Next meeting is Thursday, March 1 @ 8:30 for those interested in becoming Core group members. Those interested in Core group should already be on the Core(2) message list through Hellgate CSA. If you desire more meeting info (place) please email me personally. For those who don&#039;t know what a CSA is, I&#039;ll try a quick and dirty explanation (see below for meeting roundup):<br /><br />CSA stands for Community Supported Agriculture. A community gets together (in this case mid and southern Astoria) and pairs with a (usually organic) local farmer (ours is on the north fork of Long Island, organic). The community agrees to pay the farmer in advance to receive a &quot;share&quot; of produce throughout the growing season. Payments are needed in late March and shares begin to arrive late May. With this system, the already expensive and laborous process of organic farming is ensured to be profitable for the farmer, allowing them to concentrate on farming, not selling land to developers or something else... The benefit is that the local CSA chapter gets to know their farmer. You know where your food is coming from on a more personal level than a green market, you are supporting a local farmer, you&#039;re eating healthier, fresher food, etc etc. If there is an excellent season and a bounty, each CSA benefits. The downfall is if there is a drought, flood, etc, you suffer just as much as the farmer. Also, there is less choice than a greenmarket in terms of, you get whatever the farmer is growing, though they try to mix things up. (Our farmer has short growing crops so there may be a bad week or 2 but they can usually recover.) See below meeting roundup for more info or go to www.justfood.org which supports and helps organize NYC CSA&#039;s.<br /><br />MEETING OF THURSDAY FEB 22:<br /><br />Good to see this back up! The meeting went really well last night. The<br />farmers are very cool and very excited. Hre&#039;s a &quot;short&quot; roundup:<br /><br />Golden Earthworm Farm is a 1o yr-old-CSA-only farm. They have 5 CSAs in Queens and a<br />handful in Long Island. They are located on the north fork of Long Island<br />in Jamesport.<br /><br />share season: May 23-Thanksgiving (27 week season). We might have a winter<br />share after that (with drops once a month or so) for an extra fee. Pickups will be<br />Thursdays at Cafe Bar.<br /><br />Price: $475 per share. Feeds 3-4 (I forget whether that is a veggie-only<br />or a veggie-meat mixed diet, I think mixed).<br /><br />We&#039;re looking for a membership base of 50-100 shares.<br /><br />A share usually includes a mixed bag of 6-10 different types of veggies/<br />fruit. GE has limited fruit of their own (strawberries, watermelons,<br />raspberries) but we have the option of adding a (non-organic, low spray)<br />fruit option from one of their neighbors for tree fruit.<br /><br />GE loves tomatoes and says they&#039;ll have them throughout the season. There<br />was talk of an extra tomato share similar to Hellgate&#039;s. THe farmers were<br />up to it if we can get about 15 interested shares.<br /><br />Also, if there is a veggie a group of us really want, say artichokes??? If<br />we can get enough shares wanting the item, we can notify the farmers and<br />they&#039;ll do their best to provide.<br /><br />On a fun note, GE hosts 4 farm visits a year: April is a meet the<br />farm/farmers with technical talks and walk throughs of the fields, next is<br />strawberry picking day, Kid&#039;s Day, Fall Feastival. They also love that<br />some of us are already wanting to come work a day (or more) on the farm<br />and are totally up for labor.<br /><br />There will be a meeting next Thursday, March 1, 8:30, for those interested<br />in becoming Core group members. We will probably decide on a name at this<br />point, payment, arrangement of a membership drive Q&amp;A with the farmers for<br />recruitment, website, etc...<br />

				Thanks for the info. I was wondering if $475 seemed a bit high. I mean, it&#039;s practically double what Hellgate CSA was offering. Sorry if this has been previously addressed. I&#039;m new to this forum and the CSA thread.<br /><br />Cheers!<br />Art(uro)

				Hellgate is a non-standard CSA in that the share is smaller (about 1/2 size) than regular CSA&#039;s with a slightly shorter season.&nbsp; Hellgate is cheaper because you&#039;re getting less stuff&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />Once the details are in, we&#039;ll do a comparison of the 2 so you can see the differences.<br /><br />The new CSA may also do half shares which would help with cost (and quantity).

				Had a good time at the meeting last week. The farmers are really cool.<br /><br />Can we come up with an easier/ more catchy name than Mid-Southern Astoria CSA? Would <strong>&quot;Lower Astoria CSA&quot;</strong> work? It&#039;s a bit easier on the brain.<br /><br />Those of you who don&#039;t want to spend as much as $475 would probably be able to share with another person, there are others out there who are single people and can&#039;t spend that much, or don&#039;t want that many veggies. We should set up an<strong>&quot;I want to split my share&quot;</strong> list someplace.

				The farmers don&#039;t want to do bi-weekly or half shares b/c it&#039;s too much work on their part and it would increase our prices. We met again last night as a more Core group to try to decide a few more admin things, including the necessary (but small) 1 time admin fee, tomato shares, fruit shares, meat/dairy shares, etc. We&#039;ll be hosting a mixer in the coming month or so for perspectives to get an idea of what a CSA is and how it works. We&#039;ll have the farmers there for a Q &amp; A. More info on that tk!
