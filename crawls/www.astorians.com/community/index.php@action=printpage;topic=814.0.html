				<strong>[Please be advised that the internal links are not currently working due to the recent Migration. They will be working sooner or later. 12-22-05]</strong><br /><br />Well, here I go again, authoring another topic that I think is much needed, that is too broad in scope and that I am way too unqualified to handle.<br /><br />Merm started a topic called &quot;What is a CPU?&quot; http://astorians.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=618<br />which is a great start, and at the bottom of this post&nbsp; is a list (so far) of the technological discussions on this board which I will try to update periodically.<br /><br />I am new to technology and have been just as intimidated and overwhelmed by it as anyone else. This forum will seek to dispel those fears and replace it with a sense that high technology <em>is</em> accessible to All (as well as a sense of belonging to what we have essentially built thus far since &quot;civilization&quot; began), IOW I want contributers to this discussion that are technically savy and have the time to demystify it for us non-tech/noob types with kindness and a non-elitist perspective (Cloudnine is one of those who are more than happy to explain things in a kind, informative and enthusiastic matter), to alert us to the dangers that face us when it is in someone else&#39;s best interest to keep us in the dark.<br /><br />More and more these days, laws are being passed by people who don&#39;t even have an inkling of what they&#39;re dealing with or talking about (pulling the wool over our eyes as it were), people are being censored, surveillance is at an all-time high (Big Brother is watching), privacy is compromised with impunity on a wholesale basis by institutions that we trust the most, people that have made technological progress and the internet possible (I&#39;m speaking of the &quot;hackers&quot;) are being equated with terrorists (and treated as such) and scapegoated to direct attention away from the real culprits, and everyone seems to be having problems with their computers or cell phones to the point of unhealthy frustration.<br /><br />I forsee that this discussion will range from occult technological issues to topics concerning economics, privacy, freedom and things that the non-technological person can relate to, in other words, a sort of <em>philosophy</em> of technology. And, if you are having problems with your computer or can&#39;t get that stupid window to open, know that troubleshooting issues will be welcome here so that if we cannot solve it then at least we can learn from these meltdowns.<br /><br />I want to give a shout out to Windowsrefund of http://windowsrefund.info/ who has worked so hard to alert us to the dangers of mono-culture in the software industry and for doing so even when his cries fell on deaf ears.<br />I also want to thank the folks of 2600 for being so patient, helpful and understanding to one so incompetent as myself who only seeks to learn something that I didn&#39;t know before.<br />Not to mention the owners of Freeze Peach Cafe&#39; for helping me along this path (helping me get started with Linux) and giving me free hardware :-). Having an internet cafe&#39; with only free software machines is not only showing forsight but is also a showing of humanity and the pioneering spirit.<br /><br />As a side note I urge everone that can afford the time to entertain the idea of getting an amateur radio license (which I&#39;m still studying for). The reasons for this are obvious in the wake of September 11th and Katrina, not to mention the importance of alternative means of communication in general. Plus, it looks like it could be alot of fun :-)<br />http://astorians.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=519<br /><br /><br /><br />Long Live Radio Freek America and<br />May HAL of 2001 ever remain a fiction,<br />----zeno.<br /><br />From <strong>General Discussions</strong>:<br />&quot;random computer question&quot; http://astorians.com/index.php?topic=1431.0<br />&quot;ASTORIANS BOARD UPGRADE DISCUSSION&quot; http://astorians.com/index.php?topic=1287.0<br />&quot;Anyone got a copy of Mac OS 9.0.4 handy?&quot; http://astorians.com/index.php?topic=1380.0<br />&quot;Flying Spaghetti Monster would be proud...&quot; http://astorians.com/index.php?topic=1377.msg7785#msg7785<br />&quot;dictionary.com Word of the Day for December 31, 2005&quot; http://astorians.com/index.php?topic=1369.0<br />&quot;Simple Machines Forum Sandbox&quot; http://astorians.com/index.php?topic=1341.0<br />&quot;new aerial photos/map site&quot; http://astorians.com/index.php?topic=1281.0<br />&quot;&quot;webstream radio stations?&quot; http://astorians.com/index.php?topic=1050.0<br />&quot;astorians.net Site Upgrade&quot; http://astorians.com/index.php?topic=1265.0<br />&quot;Now this would be traveling in style!&quot; http://astorians.com/index.php?topic=1252.0<br />&quot;Calling all QNS bloggers&quot; http://astorians.com/index.php?topic=1219.0<br />&quot;Anyone need a new iPod?&quot; http://astorians.com/index.php?topic=1220.0<br />&quot;Hyperlink madness!&quot; http://astorians.com/index.php?topic=1223.0<br />&quot;car navigation &amp; Mr T.&quot; http://astorians.com/index.php?topic=1216.0<br />&quot;webcam&quot; http://astorians.com/index.php?topic=920.0<br />&quot;shameless self-blog promotion&quot; http://astorians.com/index.php?topic=1200.0<br />&quot;If Hackers Ruled&quot; http://astorians.com/index.php?topic=1187.0<br />&quot;Creative website&quot; http://astorians.com/index.php?topic=1186.0<br />&quot;Foundry&quot; http://astorians.com/index.php?topic=1158.0<br />&quot;Fun with Google&quot; http://astorians.com/index.php?topic=1100.0<br />&quot;Google video&quot; http://astorians.com/index.php?topic=1081.0<br />&quot;How to help improve astorians.net page rank in Google&quot; http://astorians.com/index.php?topic=1112.0<br />&quot;Geek Porn&quot; http://astorians.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=1210<br />&quot;Scrabble anyone?&quot; [L331 5P337 57r46613 /Ed.] http://astorians.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=1195<br />&quot;PUZZLES!!!&quot; http://astorians.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=1099<br />&quot;The Secret Life of Radiators&quot; http://astorians.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=1115<br />&quot;little baby hedphones/earbuds&quot; http://astorians.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=1093<br />&quot;NYS DL&quot; http://astorians.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=1012<br />&quot;Internet access in Astoria&quot; http://astorians.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=991<br />&quot;I just can&#39;t be cool at the Freeze Peach...

				[I had to censor this article for the board... you can get the full version here: https://www.eff.org/Net_culture/Hackers/phiber_jailed.article<br /><br />There is some controversy on the treatment of this story by various people. Some thought that by making Phiber an icon this may have damaged his case. Others at this moment languish in prison for similiar crimes and (perhaps prudently) have been advised by their lawyers to &quot;hush it up&quot;. The legal system does not like &quot;righteousness&quot;, or &quot;arrogance&quot; from those that it seeks to convict. A judge expects &quot;obedience&quot; and &quot;respect&quot;. Perhaps I am over-generalizing here, but I believe that sometimes a contemptuous attitude toward the Court can be considered a more serious offence than the original crime itself.<br /><br />----zeno.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />*********************************************************************<br />Julian Dibbell &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; julian@panix.com<br />*********************************************************************<br /><br />----------------------------------------<br /><br />(c)1993 by Julian Dibbell. &nbsp;Electronic-redistribution only, limited to<br />the net and not-for-profit BBSs. Plus, it would be nice to be advised of<br />any reposts: julian@panix.com.<br /><br />(This article originally appeared in The Village Voice, January 11, 1994)<br /><br /><br /><br />The Prisoner: Phiber Optik Goes Directly to Jail<br /><br />By Julian Dibbell<br /><br />____________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Phiber Optik is going to prison this week and if you ask me and<br />a whole lot of other people, that's just a goddamn shame.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; To some folks, of course, it's just deserts. Talk to<br />phone-company executives, most computer-security experts, any<br />number of U.S. attorneys and law-enforcement agents, or Justice<br />Louis Stanton of the Southern District of New York (who handed<br />Phiber his year-and-a-day in the federal joint at Minorsville,<br />Pennsylvania), and they'll tell you the sentence is nothing more<br />than what the young hacker had coming to him. They'll tell you<br />Phiber Optik is a remorseless, malicious invader of other<br />people's computers, a drain on the economic lifeblood of our<br />national telecommunications infrastructure, and/or a dangerous<br />role model for the technoliterate youth of today.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The rest of us will tell you he's some kind of hero. Just ask.<br />Ask the journalists like me who have come to know this<br />21-year-old high-school dropout from Queens over the course of<br />his legal travails. We'll describe a principled and gruffly<br />plain-talking spokesdude whose bravado, street-smart style, and<br />remarkably unmanipulative accessibility have made him the object<br />of more media attention than any hacker since Robert Morris<br />nearly brought down the Internet. Or ask the on-line civil<br />libertarians who felt that Phiber's commitment to nondestructive<br />hacking and to dialogue with the straight world made him an<br />ideal poster boy for their campaign against the repressive<br />excesses of the government's war on hackers. You might even ask<br />the small subset of government warriors who have arrived at a<br />grudging respect for Phiber's expertise and the purity of his<br />obsession with the workings of the modern computerized phone<br />system (a respect that has at times bordered on parental concern<br />as it grew clear that a 1991 conviction on state charges of<br />computer trespass had failed to curb Phiber's reckless<br />explorations of the system).<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; But for a truly convincing glimpse of the high regard in which<br />Phiber Optik is held in some quarters, you'd have to pay an<br />on-line visit to ECHO, the liberal-minded but hardly cyberpunk<br />New York bulletin-board system where Phiber has worked as<br />resident technical maven since last spring. Forsaking the<br />glories of phonephreaking for the workaday pleasures of hooking<br />the system up to the Internet and helping users navigate its<br />intricacies, he moved swiftly into the heart of ECHO's virtual<br />community (which took to referring to him by the name his mother<br />gave him -- Mark -- as often as by his nom de hack). So that when he<br />was indicted again, this time on federal charges of unauthorized<br />access to phone-company computers and conspiracy to commit<br />further computer crimes, ECHO too was drawn into the<br />nerve-racking drama of his case.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; As the ``coconspirators'' named in the indictment (a group of<br />Phiber's friends and government-friendly ex-friends) pleaded<br />guilty one by one, there remained brave smiles and high hopes<br />for Phiber's jury trial in July. By the time the trial date<br />arrived, however, Phiber had made an agonizing calculus of risks<br />and decided to plead guilty to one count each of computer<br />intrusion and conspiracy. ECHO was left on tenterhooks waiting<br />for the day of the sentencing. Given Mark's newfound enthusiasm<br />for more legitimate means of working with computers and his<br />undisputed insistence at the time of his plea that he had never<br />damaged or intended to damage any of the systems he broke into,<br />it seemed reasonable to wish for something lenient. A long<br />probation, maybe, or at worst a couple months' jail time. After<br />all, the infamous Morris had done considerably greater harm, and<br />he got off with no jail time at all.<br /><br />When the news arrived, therefore, of Phiber's 12-month prison<br />sentence (plus three years' probation and 600 hours of service),<br />it hit like a slap in the face, and ECHO responded with a<br />massive outburst of dismay and sympathy. ECHO's director, Stacy<br />Horn, posted the information at 3 p.m. on November 3 in the<br />system's main conference area, and within 24 hours the place was<br />flooded with over 100 messages offering condolences, advice on<br />penitentiary life, and curses on Judge Stanton. Not all the<br />messages were what you'd want to call articulate (``s**t,'' read<br />the first one in its entirety; quoth another: ``f**kf**kf**k-<br />f**kf**kf**kf**kf**kf**kf**kf**kf**kf**kf**kf**kf**kf**kf**k''),<br />nor was all the advice exactly comforting (``Try not to get<br />killed,'' a sincere and apparently quite prison-savvy Echoid<br />suggested; ``Skip the country,'' proposed one user who connects<br />from abroad, inviting Phiber to join him in sunny South Africa).<br />But the sentiment throughout was unmistakably heartfelt, and<br />when Phiber Optik finally checked in, his brief response was<br />even more so:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ``I just finished reading all this and...I'm speechless. I<br />couldn't say enough to thank all of you.''<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; He didn't have to thank anybody, of course. Motivated by genuine<br />fellow feeling as this electronic lovefest was, it was also the<br />last step in the long-running canonization of Phiber Optik as<br />the digital age's first full-fledged outlaw hero, and making<br />somebody else a hero is not necessarily the most generous of<br />acts. For one thing, we tend to get more from our heroes than<br />they get from us, and for another, we tend to be heedless of<br />(when not morbidly fascinated by) the very high psychic overhead<br />often involved in becoming a hero -- especially the outlaw kind. To<br />their credit, though, the Echoids proved themselves sensitive to<br />the weight of the burden Phiber had been asked to take on. As<br />one of them put it: ``Sorry Mark. You've obviously been made a<br />martyr for our generation.''<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; There was some melodrama in that statement, to be sure, but not<br />too much exaggeration. For ironically enough, Judge Stanton<br />himself seemed to have endorsed its basic premise in his remarks<br />upon passing sentence. Not unmoved by the stacks of letters sent<br />him in support of Phiber Optik's character and motivations, the<br />judge allowed as how a less celebrated Phiber Optik convicted of<br />the same crimes might not deserve the severity of the discipline<br />he was about to prescribe (and in Phiber's case it could be<br />argued that 12 months locked up without a computer is severe<br />enough to rate as cruel and unusual). But since Phiber had made<br />of himself a very public advertisement for the ethic of the<br />digital underground, the judge insisted he would have to make of<br />the sentence an equally public countermessage. ``The<br />defendant...stands as a symbol here today,'' said Stanton,<br />making it clear that the defendant would therefore be punished<br />as one too.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The judge did not make it clear when exactly it was that the<br />judicial system had abandoned the principle that the punishment<br />fits the crime and not the status of the criminal, though I<br />suppose that happened too long ago to be of much interest. More<br />frustratingly, he also didn't go into much detail as to what it<br />was that Phiber Optik was to stand as a symbol _of_. In at least<br />one of his remarks, however, he did provide an ample enough<br />clue:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ``Hacking crimes,'' said Judge Stanton, ``constitute a real<br />threat to the expanding information highway.''<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; That ``real threat'' bit was a nice dramatic touch, but anyone<br />well-versed in the issues of the case could see that at this point the<br />judge was speaking symbolically. For one thing, even as practiced by the<br />least scrupulous joyriders among Phiber Optik's subcultural peers, hacking<br />represents about as much of a threat to the newly rampant<br />telecommunications juggernaut as shoplifting does to the future of world<br />capitalism. But more to the point, everybody recognizes by now that all<br />references to information highways, super or otherwise, are increasingly<br />just code for the corporate wet dream of a pay-as-you-go telecom turnpike,<br />owned by the same megabusinesses that own our phone and cable systems<br />today and off-limits to anyone with a slender wallet or a bad credit<br />rating. And _that_, symbolically speaking, is what Phiber Optik's<br />transgressions threaten. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; For what did his crimes consist of after all? He picked the<br />locks on computers owned by large corporations, and he shared<br />the knowledge of how to do it with his friends (they had given<br />themselves the meaningless name MOD, more for the thrill of<br />sounding like a conspiracy than for the purpose of actually<br />acting like one). In themselves the offenses are trivial, but<br />raised to the level of a social principle, they do spell doom<br />for the locks some people want to put on our cyberspatial<br />future. And I'm tempted, therefore, to close with a rousing<br />celebration of Phiber Optik as the symbol of a spirit of<br />anarchic resistance to the corporate Haussmannization of our<br />increasingly information-based lives, and to cheer Phiber's hero<br />status in places like ECHO as a sign that that spirit is<br />thriving.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; But I think I'll pass for now. Phiber Optik has suffered enough<br />for having become a symbol, and in any case his symbolic power<br />will always be available to us, no matter where he is. Right<br />now, though, the man himself is going away for far too long, and<br />like I said, that's nothing but a goddamn shame.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Title: <strong>Automatic Restart</strong><br />
				Post by: <strong>Big Brother</strong> on <strong>October 14, 2005, 11:34:47 PM</strong>

			<dd class="postbody">
				Hi Kaosaur, I'm having problems with my computer automatically restarting. I suspected it had something to do with a conflict with the sound card [(Creative SB Live! series (WDM)] but I think (by process of elimination) that this is not the case, and now I am suspecting a short rather than a software problem. It could also be the temperature, though I think this unlikely. Is there an application to monitor the temperature of the CPU? I notice that the comp tends to shut down when I have music or applications running... it's almost as if this were too much for it to handle... and over time it shuts down more frequently (temperature?).<br /><br />[Am still looking for applications to moniter the temperature of the CPU et alii. and have got a lead... Will soon be posting links here /Ed.] <br /><br />The computer previously belonged to a hardcore gamer and has been upgraded by him (sound card, memory) and was Extremely dirty and dusty. Also the moniter's chord is kablooey (I had to tie it in a knot to get the monitor to work)- could this be the problem...will try connecting to another monitor [Much later: nope, that's not the problem]. I don't see anything wrong with the fans (I cleaned them &amp; air-canned the rest) or the connections. Microslut's site has been less than helpful. Ran CWS, Ad-Aware &amp; Spybot in that order in safe-mode. Also noticed that the computer didn't restart automatically in safe-mode (I fell asleep for about six hours with it on).<br /><br />I haven't gotten around to shutting off the &quot;services&quot; yet as blackviper's site has been down. [Much later: O.k., I shut the majority of &quot;services&quot; down (Blackviper's site is still down, wtf? got to send him some $) hopefully this will work] [Much much later: Nope, that didn't work either]<br /><br />[Later: Am now booting up with a live CD of Knoppix, just to see whether in fact this problem is a hardware problem or a software conflict]<br /><br />[Later: System crashed and re-booted. Well, I'm led to believe that it is indeed a hardware problem and I suspect that the gamer's upgrades were too much for this box to handle. And here I was all ready to screw Microsoft and install a clean version of Ubuntu! which I plan to do anyway as soon as I get this accursed thing fixed. Later tonight or tomorrow I will re-go-over all the connections, uninstall the added memory and sound card and clean it yet again. Unless of course somebody out there has figured out the problem. If all else fails then I will bring it to Growtechsolutions and ask how much it will cost for a preliminary diagnostic.

				Title: <strong>Binary Revolution Radio - History of Elite Speak</strong><br />

				Stank Dawg is a Floridian who is a supporter of the Creative Commons License initiative, so therefore I reprint his article here with his prior approval (I haven't gotten a chance to e-mail him yet to ask for formal permission). It is one of my favorite articles.<br /><br />Enjoy :-),<br />-zen cf<br /><br />[Note: One word, the &quot;S&quot; word as in sh*t has been censored by phpBB /Ed.]<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">A history of 31337sp34k<br />From DocDroppers<br />Author: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;StankDawg<br />Date Released: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;07/15/2002 - In 2600 Magazine (http://store.yahoo.com/2600hacker/fall2002.html).<br />Added to DD: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;09:44, 23 Nov 2004 (EST)<br /><br /><br />Y d0 j00 hakkerz al’//4ys t4lK Lik3 Th!s?<br /><br /><br />Well first of all, I am not going to write the entire article in “elite speak”. It defeats the purpose and is annoying beyond belief in this context. What I am going to do is enlighten the new generation of hakkerz into what “elite speak” is, where it came from, and when (and if) to use it. It has become commonplace in the hakker community, but I think everyone should understand its origins.<br /><br /><br />Long before Internet Explorer was even thought of, and when Netscape was still a wet dream, the Internet existed. Most people reading this article know that the Internet is not the same as the World Wide Web, but for the novices, it imperative to point this out. Back then, we used to communicate through earlier aspects of the internet, some of which still exist today. The most prominent are Email, Newsgroups, and Internet Relay Chat (IRC).<br /><br /><br />Let’s start with Email. It is the most obvious and widespread in use. Its use has exploded since back in the early days. Back then, we used emoticons to convey emotions, not to decorate our email with pretty pictures. We didn’t come up with the word “emoticons”, that was some media bullshit label made up to be cute. We used them for effectiveness. Using emoticons could convey in a couple of keystrokes what might take several sentences. Keep in mind that back then, we had to keep our messages short and sweet. I used a 300 baud modem (the coupler kind that you had to put the headset into) to get dial-up access. Broadband was never heard of in this low bandwidth world, so messages had to be brief. Think of how telegrams work today, where there is an incentive to be brief (telegrams charge per word). To that end, we would simply use the letter “Y” instead of typing the entire word “Why”. We used “R U” to shorten the phrase “are you”. These are only a few examples. The drawbacks to this are that people who are not used to it may get confused and wonder if “Y” means “why” or “yes”. It could refer to either of these. It was only after practice and reading for context did people become accustomed to using this new “shorthand” to communicate, but this was only the beginning of the language.<br /><br /><br />“Elite Speak” really took off with the onset of newsgroups. The net was growing, bandwidth was increasing (I was now up to a 900 or 1200 baud modem), and newsgroups (which came about the same time as email using a slightly different protocol) were becoming more popular. Newsgroups allowed people with common interests to have a central area to communicate with one another. In this medium, the same shorthand used in email was perpetuated and expanded. But an additional problem arose. The server administrators felt the need to control the content and censor speech that they found “questionable”. They would regularly filter the database to delete posts containing “objectionable material” just like the content filtering software of today.<br /><br /><br />What this meant was that you either got your messaged deleted by the administrators or you found loopholes to outsmart the filters. That is what hakkerz do. I get a lot of flak from n00bs who don’t understand why I say “Hakkerz” instead of “Hackers”. The reason is simple. Since “hacking” fell under the “objectionable material” category, we had to intentionally misspell the word to avoid getting kill-filed. OK, so they added “hakker” to their filter. But what about “H4ck3r”, “H4kk3r”,”Hax0r”, and so on? We kept adapting the language (and don’t think this is any less of a language than Ebonics) until the censors finally gave up. We could make every word adapt and change to avoid being blocked. It got to the point where we started intentionally misspelling words that didn’t even have the potential to be kill-filed. Words like “Kool” and “rokk” began to be added and it fit with the pattern of our other words while stilling maintaining meaning. Eventually, they realized that it was impossible to block a polymorphic language, and they gave up.<br /><br /><br />The final transformation of the language was built purely on ego! That’s right, there is an aspect of simple ego involved of trying to look “kool”, and it came about mostly on IRC. Those of us who have been online for the genesis of the language communicated like we always had, using the methods mentioned above. It was mostly out of sheer habit. This led to inevitable questions from n00bie Hax0rs and non-hakkerz alike asking why we “can’t spell” and asking what we were trying to say. Nubies picked up on the language, but they began to pervert it. Because we used words like “h4kk3r” which used both letters and numbers in it, it made the word appear to be in mIXeD CasE (because using a fixed font, numbers are generally bigger than letters). This caused many people to start using “mIx3d c4Se” just for the sake of making words look like the traditional “elite speak”. Quite frankly, it did look kind of kool (when not used to excess)!<br /><br /><br />So with all of these things creating and modifying the language, you can see why we have such a beast. It grew out of necessity. The new generations of hakkerz pick up and learn the language as it is today, but they don’t always understand and appreciate its roots. Hopefully now they understand the history and the beauty of the language.<br /><br /><br />Where does it go from here? This is an ever-evolving language! It is, by no means, set in stone. Currently, it is accounting for multiple languages (Spanish, “Spanglish”, Portuguese, etc…), adding current slang speaking terms (“wasssssup”, “pissed”,etc…), and remnants from many other languages. The most complex addition is the integration of actual source code and symbolism into the language. In the beginning of this article I said that the World Wide Web is not the same as the Internet. More than likely, had we been talking online, I would have said “WWW != Internet” just like I always say that “Hakkerz != Criminals”. Hopefully, with all of this newfound history, you will not only understand the language, but you will also appreciate it, and use your new power isely. Use it with other hakkerz, but don’t annoy people who don’t or can’t understand it. 0n1y t#en ‘//!ll j00 +ruly b ‘1337!</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Some of his other work can be found here:<br />http://binrev.com/<br />http://www.docdroppers.org/<br />http://www.stankdawg.com/

&nbsp;Post subject: More on this... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reply with quote Edit/Delete this post Delete this post<br />Monday, November 07th 2005 1200 hours will see the kick-off of a series (if the gods are willing) of weekly events centering around the free (in both senses of the word) information that is available about technology and the culture of technology.<br />&lt;BR&gt;(in this particular case, PoDcasts)<br /><br />The original idea was started by Windowsrefund when he attempted to spark interest by gathering an audience together at the Peach to listen to the Massachusetts hearing on OpenDocument Format which was considerately downloaded, burned &amp; supplied by CritterNYC who was currently working on a project called Portable Firefox at the time. I guess alot of the people coming into the cafe' didn't realize what was going on hence the idea of introducing a large sandwich Smile It was originally going to be 4 feet, then (at the advice of a friend) became 8 feet, but due to the impractical nature of such a large sandwich, I think that we are going to settle for two (2) four (4) foot heroes with the promise of drunken rewards for those of us who delight in such things afterwards (to counteract the healthy nature of the sandwich in the name of Balancing the Equation &lt;/smirk&gt;) The idea was further given the breath of life by Frozenfroot who thought that such an event would be good on a weekly basis. Hopefully Merm will give me a hand with the sandwiches!<br /><br />To tell you the truth though, I am not expecting a large turn-out. It was decided that Monday's at 12pm is usually was slow time of the week, which is o.k. with me because we will be trying to listen to spoken word with undivided attention anyhow. It doesn't matter though what the turn out is, it is enough that the event takes place, and that consistently, from week to week, information being exchanged and yet another time-slot in the year where like-minded individuals can find haven. Between the Cons, the various computer clubs and user groups there should be no day in the year where one can't find or communicate knowledge by speaking to a live individual face-to-face when one needs to get up and away from the computer screen for awhile.<br /><br />I chose Binary Revolution Radio for several reasons. The creator, Stank Dawg is very entertaining in addition to being highly informed. He is 1337 yet not &quot;elitist&quot;. A very down to earth personality who emanates intelligence and humanity; I just like listening to him. I chose this particular episode because I think the science of Cryptology has been getting much attention lately from the general public given the popular craze surrounding books as The DaVinci Code and the success of such movies like Enigma &amp; National Treasure, and the mystery that surrounds and fascinates all who come into knowledge or contact with the sculpture of Kryptos. I also think (on a socially conscious level) that the time is now ripe for people who are concerned about their privacy in their personal day-to-day communications, whether it be by email or videophone to take hold of the reigns of simple technological solutions that are easily within the grasp of every man, woman and child, and to use these tools which is our human birthright to begin laying a sound pavement along the long and glorious road to freedom.<br /><br />Well, anyway, get your pencils and papers ready &amp; here are some sites you might want to have handy in near future...<br /><br />http://elonka.com/kryptos/<br />http://www.binrev.com/radio/archive.php?p=5<br />http://members.aol.com/nova1337/tutorial.htm<br />http://www.phreaknic.info/pn9/<br /><br />What follows is the Phreaknik challenge which Elonka cracked, she uses this code in a tutorial that some of us will be following:<br /><br />http://members.aol.com/nova1337/phreaknic.txt<br /><br /><br />Cyrillic Projector<br /><br />OMN1SCAN<br />_________________<br />&quot;Don't burn the oil wells.&quot; -George W.

This particular cipher is <em>ancient</em> and is still widely used.<br /><br /><strong>Transposition:</strong> When all the information to understanding the message is present but the order is all mixed up. For example, if you write the following encrypted text (&quot;TKIHESEY3&quot;) on a 3x3 grid from left to right (starting at the top) and then you read down, the decrypted result is (&quot;THEKEYIS3&quot;) or &quot;The key is three.&quot;<br /><br />T K I<br />H E S<br />E Y 3<br /><br /><strong>Concealment:</strong> The actual hiding of the text or information. Writing with lemon juice is one example, hiding text within a picture or audio file is another (as is used in steganography). Elonka gave the example of the messenger who had his head shaved and the message tattooed on his head. After waiting for his hair to grow back he was sent across enemy lines (where he was searched and nothing was found) whereupon his head was re-shaved and the message presented to the receiver. In the short story/movie Johnny Pneumonic (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113481/) the courier had secret information downloaded into his brain (which had cyber-electronic components surgically implanted). This may seem far-fetched, but the recent advent of nano-technology makes all of this quite plausible and has far reaching implications for concealment type ciphers.<br /><br /><strong>2600 (frquency &amp; Group &amp; Atrai):</strong><br /><br /><strong>Binary:</strong><br /><br /><strong>Hex:</strong><br /><br /><strong>rot13:</strong> If you begin at 'A' and count thirteen letters you end up at 'N'; conversly... If you start at 'N' and count thirteen you conveniently end up at 'A'. Rot13 has been used extensively on Usenet Newsgroups<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">ABCDEFGHIJKLM<br />NOPQRSTUVWXZ</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">A=N &amp; N=A; B=O &amp; O=B... ...M=Z &amp; Z=M</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />What makes &quot;rot13&quot; or Rotation 13, so elegant is that the English Alphabet has 26 letters which divided by 13 is 2. Therefore an A will equal an N and an N will equal an A... which is not found in rot15 or rot12, let's say.<br /><br /><strong>Elonka:</strong> (cryptological Expert...cracked phreaknic3; cyr pr et alii. more to come) [elonka.com]<br /><br /><strong>Blowfish:</strong> An encryption algorithm. http://www.schneier.com/blowfish.html Bruce Schneier is a &nbsp;reknowned figure in cryptography and computer security. Not only is he smart but I also suspect him to be good.

You can grab them on the net and print them out and after cutting out the shape you can encode and decode to your hearts content. Some of them are quite intricate and beautiful.<br /><br /><strong>coder:</strong> Someone or something that puts things into or pulls things out of secret code? :-) &nbsp;More specifically, someone who writes computer code and/or programs in one or more of the many languages available. More on this later, as I am deficient in this area as well and need to do more studying.

Not necessarily a criminal unless actively breaking the law, just as a locksmith is not necessarily a burgler. The term was invented (I think) to represent someone who used hacking techniques for malicious or criminal purposes so as to distinguish this type of individual from the originally accepted definitions of 'hacker' which term &nbsp;was said to be born in the &quot;hacking culture surrounding TMRC and the MIT AI Lab.&quot;-The Jargon File (version 4.4.7)<br />There is much controversy surrounding this designation as there is with &quot;Black hat&quot;, &quot;White hat&quot; or &quot;Grey Hat&quot; type hackers... controversy which by some is seen as a complete waste of time.<br /><br /><strong>cryptanalyst:</strong> Someone who analyzes and codes and ciphers.<br /><br /><strong>cryptographer:</strong> Someone who studies and/or utilizes 'hiddden writing&quot;.<br /><br /><strong>Cryptology:</strong> The science/study of codes and ciphers.<br /><br /><strong>Cryptography:</strong><br /><strong>encryption</strong><br /><strong>decryption</strong><br /><strong>encode</strong><br /><strong>decode</strong><br /><strong>graphene?:</strong><br /><br /><strong>Hacker:</strong> One definition which I<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Finally, I should mention that the term &quot;hacker&quot; in the title is meant in the original sense of an aficionado of computers--someone who enjoys making computers do new things, or do old things in a new and clever way. The hacker is usually quite good at his craft, but may very well not be a professional computer programmer or designer. The hacker's work may be useful or may be just a game. As an example of the latter, more than one determined hacker has written a program which, when executed, writes out an exact copy of itself<span style="font-size: 9px;" class="bbc_size">1</span>.

In my own humble opinion, they (the hackers) are the only ones who stand between us and the oncoming and complete Obfuscation that threatens to overtake all of us wee folk when privatised knowledge finally lays soley in the hands of a wealthy, ruling, certified elite who believe that Knowledge in a loyal consumer/producer is an undesirable even dangerous thing as we enter yet deeper and further into the Mechanical/Digital/Petroleum Age.&lt;/rant&gt;</span><br /><br /><strong>Jello Biafra</strong> Don't really know what he has to do with Cryptography or why I'm listing him here...

I have more personal reasons as well, having to do with the contsitutional right to privacy: see the P.A.T.R.I.O.T. Act thread (hopefully I have matured a little since beginning that thread).<br /><br />I still only use rudimentary encryption algorithms for my communications (if at all) and the reasons for this, although there are a plethora of open-sourced tools available to me only a small download away are simply ignorance and laziness. Many people avoid using passwords because remembering them is a tiresome task, or typing it in simply takes too long. Now, through the modern miracle of mnemonics I can remember a password 40+ characters long! And so can you! Take this example:<br /><br />&quot;Sometimes I Go To The Refrigerator Very Late At Night To Get A Late Night Snack. Whether I Eat Cheese Or Cereal It Really Makes No Difference Just As Long As I Remember To Brush My Teeth Afterwards Because Tooth-Decay Is An Unpleasant Thing, Just Like Bad Breath.(my phone # with the last two digits changed (and a different area code)&quot;...<br /><br />Renders this relatively secure password: [&quot;SIGTTRVLANTGALNS.WIECOCIRMNDJALAIRTBMTABT-DIAUT,JLBB.(my phone # with the last two digits changed (and a different area code)&quot;] =<br />Sixty-five (65) characters<br /><br />By using numbers and punctuation marks in addition to alphabetic characters you increase the sophistication of the password. Add to this case sensitivity then you may have something very daunting indeed. Of course, the above example may be a little extreme so you'll have to adjust the strength of your passwords for your own needs. You could measure the time taking to type the password in against how much the information you are attempting to protect is worth. But to not use them at all or a password that is easily cracked or guessed (like a pet's name or your favorite food) may not be advisable. I guess, what I'm trying to say is that with a little information, solutions are only a small act of volition away.<br /><br />I hope you will join us this week as we learn how to protect our privacy together and am sure you will see me taking notes.<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Note: I am open to suggestions regarding the nature of the hero or the brunch... it doesn't even have to be a hero. I'm trying to keep it vegetarian however, as I want to try something different and vegetables are for the most part cost effective. Today's hero will be the same as last week, and No, I didn't use the leftovers from last week lol. I will buy the vegetable materials the same day or the night before. The reason that it is the same as last week is due to a lack of imagination and also, I really want to get a handle on the exact amount of goods needed to make this particular hero in order to further my knowledge of this special branch of sandwich technology.<br /><br />As for the programming, I am always looking for new shows to listen to and Tech-Brunch won't be sticking exclusively to Binary Revolution Radio. I am planning a Monday in the future that will have 4 or 5 (10-15) minute shows.<br /><br />Also: If anyone would like to give a talk or a presentation having to do with tech in lieu of the Internet Broadcast please get in touch with me... however, keep in mind that 12pm Monday may not be the most lucrative time. You will have at least two listeners!<br /><br />There is alot of free information out there and I advise everyone to explore on their own so that we may pool together the fruits of our exploration and so be in a position to build a better tommorrow based on information and humanity.<br /><br />-Zeno.<br />_________________<br />&quot;I have known Fear.

				Writeup: Teknological Brunch http://astorians.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=1121<br /><br />November 21, 14:47....2005--Monday_The Multiverse<br />Opening music: &quot;Glory of the Many&quot; (from System Shock 2)<br />Programming[?]: Episode 89 - CEH Questions (http://www.binrev.com/radio/archive/binrev089.mp3) of Binary RevolutionRadio (http://www.binrev.com/)<br />Ending music: (closing music on Binrev) &quot;Give'em What They Want&quot; by Woo Child (http://www.woochild.com/)<br /><br /><strong><em>Special</em> shouts:</strong> Windowsrefund (http://windowsrefund.info/) (Your arguments for Free Software Movement (http://www.fsf.org/) and alternatives to monoculture are getting more and more persuasive as well as air-tight... You are truly an inspiration &amp; it is only a matter of time before there is a New York panel on Open Document Format! (http://www.groklaw.net/articlebasic.php?story=20050926191316526)); SKaReCRoW (whose presence at these events not only helps hold the thing together but educates and inspires as well...I am honored to know you); La Machina (keep coming, there is much to learn!); Frozenfroot (It was you who first said to me that &quot;Linux is the solution&quot;); Merm (I'm still trying ;-)); Doctor Mung Mung and his biblical friend whom I don't have a handle for yet (for an enjoyable evening at Wave); CritterNYC (http://johnhaller.com/jh/) am enjoying your very small applications :-); JCY for a very pleasant lunch and meaningful discussion at Watana and all the other kind individuals who showed up but whose handles for now escape me.<br /><br /><strong>Logistics:</strong><br />Today we tried something different and I was a little late as a result. Next week I will remember to prep the brunch at least 2 hours early and not procrastinate as much in preparation for the event as well as getting the notes out there <em>post</em> the event.<br /><br />There were not as many people this Monday (it varied from 4 to 9 people) but we are going for consistency here rather than quantity... and quality is always a plus (which excluding my humble self) I believe we have achieved ;-)<br />However, the sooner we get a consistent amount of people showing up in greater numbers (15 or so) then the sooner we can ask people like Elonka, Emmanual Goldstein or Bernie S. to show up and give a presentation.<br /><br />Some of the questions that were raised was: &quot;Where do I learn to hack?&quot; and not having earned that title myself I can only direct the curious to go to the source and ask the hackers themselves. 2600 meetings are a start and there is more than enough information on the Net. I'll relist some of the links below. In future we will listen to more shows geared towards the aspiring hacker but until then these shows I have found useful [...] and of course the erudite Jargon File is a great launching point to computer hacking culture. Of course anything to do with technology, be it automechanics to music can also be a good place to start. Public libraries are also a great source for access to materials that would normally cost a small fortune. I definitely recommend textfiles.com and a perusal of their audio archives.<br /><br />Another question was &quot;How many times to you have to listen to a show until you can have an understanding of the material?&quot;, to which I answered that &quot;It depends on the material as well as whether I'm taking notes or not, but generally three or four times.&quot; Paying close attention also helps but many times I have shows going on in the background while I'm doing something else, so I pick up snippets of information here and there while I'm working or otherwise preoccupied.<br /><br />Another question concerned shortwave radio, for which there is already a group at the Freezepeach that is studying for the various licenses. I direct the curious to ARRL's website (http://www.arrl.org/) (American Radio Relay League) which is actually the National Association for Amateur Radio.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 9px;" class="bbc_size">Schrödinger's Wraps<br />(2pks.)Flour Tortillas (toasted slightly in frying pan);

				Writeup: Technol0gical Brunch http://astorians.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=6543#6543<br /><br />November 28, 17.55....2005--Monday_We Are Not Alone<br />Opening music: &quot;Depends on the Drug...&quot;, Jello Biafra; Theme music from Deus Ex<br />Programming[?]: Social Engineering Panel - The Fifth HOPE<br />Ending music: bgdax-elf-song-remix.mp3; Icewind Dale Theme<br /><br /><strong>Special shouts:</strong> SKaReCRoW aka Touched by Gods, whose encouragement, support and time means more to me than words can express. Your definition of hackerdom is worth more than its weight in gold... I am continually inspired. Follow your True Course, it is redemption for El Mundo ; XlogicX, for joining the forums and... opening the door to...well... Logic (read Logos); Jayme (who is a light in an otherwise cloud covered day); Frozenfroot (without whose support this brunch would not be possible and for continually getting me to Think &amp; whose focus on Libertarianism and Equality remains as constant as a L.A.S.E.R.); Merm, whose friendship and caring might just possibly keep me alive a bit more longer than necessary ;-); Green Circus, for not only the great music but for posing a solution to a problem that affects even CEOs of evil mega-corporations... check them out!; Jh. for showing up again...albeit a little bit late :-) (You can always refer to the writeups and links... but it would be nice if you furnished me with a handle :-)); to One who showed up, showed interest (which is inspiring to me) but whose name I didn't obtain (talk to me next time!); &amp; last but not least Dm. who once posed a question which made me evaluate if Love really existed in this distracted and perhaps robotized heart. I seek to know you better. Shouts all... you are keeping me alive.<br /><br /><strong>Logistics &amp; Random Notes:</strong><br />Today was more entertaining to the audience than I had predicted. Personally, I can't get enough of this stuff. Whenever I come across a con (whether fictional or not, whether successful or not) I feel that my knowledge of psychology has broadened. It's as if a window has been opened on a certain aspect of human nature and as a result may even make me personally a little more resilient.<br /><br />This is a very controversial subject and needs to have a more in-depth debate.<br />One point was made that a possible detrimental effect of alot of people practicing SE was to initiate even further control, procedures and restrictions. Paranoia might become even more in fashion and simple human interactions could break down. While I didn't see an easy answer to this another point was made that when a corporation or governmental body allows information to be compromised then personal privacy suffers as a result. Someone pointed out that companies simply need to train their employees better and should actually know the equipment that they are using. But wouldn't that mean that trained employees would be worth more money and not as expendable?<br /><br />Earlier (during the show) someone mentioned a recent break in Experian's security which I still have to look up &amp; post some links.<br />Some of the later discussion involved how to get started in coding. It was suggested to me that I learn how to use a text editor such as emacs or vi. I confessed that I still haven't learned to touch-type &lt;embarassed&gt; Emulation. The 'folding' function in vi. Pulse dialing (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_dialing). The huge variety of phreaking tools throughout telephone history.<br />We also thought about the question of &quot;What is a hacker?&quot; One definition is someone that gets something to work that didn't work before, or work in a way that is desired, with many examples illustrated. We also talked about the U.F.O. sightings in CARTERET, New Jersey http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=92865<br />and Charles Fort's The Book of the Damned (http://tinyurl.com/bgkzk) http://www.forteana.org/<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 9px;" class="bbc_size">Prep time: 08:06-09-51 (Wow, I <em>am</em> inefficient)+ around 30 minutes heating and wrapping the wraps.

				daveed, did you try updating the BIOS on the laptop?<br /><br />also, sometimes the HD that is inside the external case can get very very hot, which might be causing the system lock. &nbsp;maybe a diff. slower, older HD might work better because it will run cooler. &nbsp;or it could be the laptop running hot also, in which case a laptop cooling stand might help.

Megc &amp; Solange for being sincere and warm-hearted people... actually Super Duper Top-level Domain type props go to Megc, for being a true friend who has comforted me in my hour of Darkness, whose music is inspiring and genuine love of the people around her set an example to follow... I&#39;ve learned alot from you Megc, please don&#39;t go!; Jcy for contributing to Tech Discussion (on the board) concerning troubleshooting issues &amp; also for pointing out errors in my political arguments in a helpful and good-hearted way; the impromptu Sunday gathering at the Peach for the lively &amp; entertaining discussion in true <em>salon</em> fashion; Cary for being so forgiving of my inadequacies in communication... check out his site (http://caryscolumn.blogspot.com/), Zorba&#39;s for the excellent Keish!, Carlos for encouraging me to cook and for many helpful suggestions for the Brunch as well as offering advice concerning food whenever I need it... you are a resource to the community!<br /><span class="bbc_u">Mad</span> <span class="bbc_u">Shoutz</span> to 2600NYC And PHX2600 (These people Know how to process Information!!)...check out their uber-professional site (http://www.phx2600.org/) and forums (http://www.phx2600.org/forum/index.php)<br /><br /><strong>Logistics &amp; Random Notes:</strong><br /><span style="font-size: 9px;" class="bbc_size">Prep time: 00.00.00 Listening to: Nothing<br />(1 tray=12 slices) Spinach Keish <em>courtesy o</em>f Zorba&#39;s; three (3) slices left over<br /><br /><em>comments</em>:Althought the Keish was yummy, it was also quite costly (even after the <span class="bbc_u">excellent</span> discount that the proprietor was kind enough to give me). Fact of the matter is, this week found me lazy and disorganized. SKaReCRoW suggested that the Keish would have been better if heated and served on a bed of white rice, which suggestion I will execute in future future future (http://www.trs80.com/home.html)...</span><br /><br />Today was kind of lighthearted, distracted and non-serious and this extended to the show as well as to the brunch itself, so there&#39;s not too much to write about here, which is also good because I&#39;m still trying to digest the information from the previous weeks... and there is always programming and logic to learn and literally Miles of literature to catch up on. It seems that Time is the overriding concern no matter what we do. Thankfully their are people working on that problem as well.<br /><br />I really think that this is one of my most favorite of the &quot;fun&quot; binrev episodes... something about Lucky&#39;s sketch on Tr0n sticks in my head and this also had the effect of encouraging me in my addiction to the web tv series &quot;The.Scene&quot; and it&#39;s attendant parody &quot;Teh.Scene&quot; which I sincerely recommend everybody to watch. I found &quot;Teh.Scene&quot; very very funny. While the show may or may not be an accurate portrayal of the software piracy scene, it is a highly original creation of alternative media... and yes there <em>is</em> non-content-free information to be found in it. Unfortunately it has the unfortunate reputation of being torn apart by critics... who may or may not be creative themselves. Also, I can listen to Stank&#39;s screaming rants again and again without them <em>ever</em> getting old... and add comuniques from SystemSh0xxx0r! into the mix and you have a <span class="bbc_u">perfect</span> show!<br /><br />I honestly believe that the number to call for ANI is 958... but not having a landline (for all you passive fingerprinters out there :-)) I find this difficult to test out. I feel kind of weird asking my friends to call this number... but I have a feeling I&#39;ll soon get over this weirdness. To add to the dilemma, I still don&#39;t know whether this still applies to payphones (easy enough to find out) and COCOTS (Customer-owned coin-operated telephone system) are said not to work at all being that they are not using the same system as the IBX (Incumbent service provider)[ later: sorry, I don&#39;t think that IBX is a term at all... I was probably thinking of ILECs (Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier)]; and VOIP is right out highly problematical. [later...] O.K., I have a confirm.. 958 does indeed work (afaik) on Verizown[/color]]Verizown (http://[color=black) payphones.<br /><br />As a side note, I met yet <em>another</em> individual who thought that the definition of hacking was breaking into people&#39;s computers, case closed. O.K., security penetration <em>is</em> a subset of hacking, but to say that this is what defines hacking is not only assinine but ridiculous (did that make sense?) This is like saying that the field of Biology is restricted to the study of swans. I sincerely believe that the majority of the hackers out there that actually do penetration testing and bypass security systems do so out of boredom, curiosity as a sort of <em>game</em> in their off-time! Most of the hackers that I&#39;ve met look on this practice as a non-serious diversion likened to playing Klondite solitaire that most people &amp; office workers are all too familiar with. And God forbid that they actually <em>alert</em> the companies in question of a security hole which if exploited for criminal ends could have disasterous consequences. Despite the Draconian punishments that await such people many hackers do in fact try to be helpful in the interest of the public good,&nbsp; often with disasterous consequences to themselves. On their &quot;on-time&quot; they are writing useful applications, building the internet, innovating or inventing new hardware, or even doing security and penetration testing for their employers!...iow pushing foward the Technological Age and reaching out and improving their Communities...iow Helping people, which is more than I can say for soulless companies such as Microsoft, Verizon, Time-Warner or Burger King.<br /><br />The Word Hacker (http://www.paulgraham.com/gba.html) by Paul Graham<br /><br />Watch the video put out by &quot;Hippies From Hell&quot; where they show someone making a keyboard out of pebbles and stones at a Hacker conference and tell me What has this to do with &quot;breaking into people&#39;s computers&quot;. Newsflash: Hackers are Not at All interested in your data or what you wrote in your email. These gals and guys are easily bored with even exciting things! The only people who <em>do</em> care are corporations and the Government, the prior to sell you something, the latter to control you, to paraphrase d3c0d3r. The difference is that these corp.govs don&#39;t need to <em>break</em> into your computer... they have already been invited!<br />A good question to point out at this juncture is &quot;Where does Spam come from?&quot; If you answer this question correctly then you are well on your way to seeing through the illusion of consensus reality which is the Matrix.<br /><br />Another thing that I find humorous is that hackers are notorious for <em>hating</em> the Windows/Mac environments. They love the Linuxes &amp; the BSDs.<br />So why in the <em>hell</em> would they want to take over your Windows machine?<br />Perhaps to torture themselves? :-)<br />Media tells us one thing... History teaches us another. Look To Your History!&lt;/rant&gt; :-)<br /><br />As far as Tech-Brunch, there is a possible presentation coming soon (it will be our first) although perhaps it will have to be a Tech-Dinner or Dessert. Keep your ear to the ground!<br /><br />Also, rumor has it that there is another Hacker Conference in the works, and the prospects for this are very exciting indeed.

I look at this as a good thing, however as it is exposing us to some of the great culinary institutions as well as the great people in the neighborhood. This is precious.</span><br /><br />Hi all in Internet TV Land!<br />This week was very stimulating and the energy levels were up there between clouds 7 and 8 and at brief moments were spiking towards the Holy Nine. I can honestly say that listening to BaseNet or talking with the creators usually has this effect on me and I don't think I'm alone. &nbsp;Many people don't know that the crew at BaseNet are actually highly politically and socially oriented and yet do a very good job at keeping it to a minimum on their show... which may (Destiny willing) soon be remedied by <em>another</em> show devoted to this sad yet necessary topic exclusively... let us hope that they go through with it. Maybe their unending humor will bleed over into such a show as well and inspire us to think our ways out of such morasses and concrete rooms as we find ourselves at present in a positive and thoughtful manner. I don't doubt it for a second. This group definitely jokes around alot and continually claims their show as A.D.D. Compliant and yet at the same time, IMHO they are also some of the most down to earth people that I know who <em>know</em> what &quot;the deal&quot; is; shattering the sacrosanct Prism of Occlusion that blinds us with pretty illusions, phantasms of ignorance, oligarchical deceptions; solving problems, in a way that is both peaceful, egalitarian and noble...i.e. truly educating. And don't get me wrong... I don't think they're doing this because they have some Grand Mission... they're doing this because they enjoy it!<br />Again, let's give them our support... they deserve it.<br /><br />At the brunch a new [to us] method of hacking the polaroid picture was employed. Whenever you take one and it begins to develop, just draw on it with a stylus and according to the pressure that you apply you get variations in thickness as well as color superimposed upon the captured image. This is because of the fluid that resides within the photograph which eventually dries... and that's really all I know about the logistics behind that. We thought that a new genre of art could be created from this given the time-critical nature of drawing on a polaroid before it dries. We also came up with a name for one of the snacks served at the Freeze... namely the &quot;Hacking Isaac's Newton&quot; which was bravely modeled by SKaReCRoW. At one point we had four people working on this title, including the author of &quot;The Bad Catholic's Guide to Good Living&quot;, JPZmirak. Let's just say that we had a ball naming the &quot;fig&quot; dish.<br /><br />After the meeting SKaReCRoW and I had some fun with the local Verizon and COCOTs in the neighborhood... always being careful not to harm these precious artifacts or break any laws of course, and I think that SKaReCRoW found some interesting avenues to explore. Next time I'd like to bring along a digital recorder to capture some of the interesting sounds that we heard as well as capturing the rocket take-off effect of the Freeze's Expresso machine. Speaking of the Peach, we also need someone to contribute a stamp for the cup of the U.S.A. P.A.T.R.I.O.T. Missile Large Americano heavily caffeinated beverage. :-)<br /><br />Well, I guess I got to apologize for the delay the last few weeks (and this week) for the approriate links and T.O.M.s... I haven't forgotten about them you know. But looking back over the past six weeks (it's hard to believe how time flies) I'm under the impression that I'm getting a type of handle on this kind of thing and perhaps am improving (albeit sluggishly) with age. Please remember, that the Brunch is a humble endeavor but has the potential to be much more... I think that it is it's humility that protects it from attempting to be something grandiose that it is not.<br /><br />Food.<br />Information.<br /><em>(FoodInformation &lt;NewSpeak)</em><br /><br />Everything else that follows (and things already have) are added blessings that breathe in Life nourishing mana flowing in like River Nile. Again, in this humble project, consistency is king, which means basically at the very least rolling out of bed in the morning and if too lazy to cook then buying a bag of bagels &lt;smirk&gt;.<br />And as far as Content?... well, that's easy... the people creating these radio shows have already done the hard work for us.<br /><br />Humbly,<br />zen/CF SubcorticalAI operating system architecure No.00009 v12.0 Beta<br /><br /><br /><strong>Linksys:</strong><br /><br />http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1149.txt<br /><br /><strong>Books, Magazines, Manuals &amp; other Media:</strong><br /><br />Powers of Ten<br /><br /><strong>T.O.M.s (http://www.tomshardware.com/index.html) (<em>Terminological Offensive Maneuvers</em>):</strong><br /><br /><strong><em>Projects...</em></strong><br /><br /><strong>Pong update:</strong><br /><strong><em>MK-Ultra Pong</em></strong> is <em>temporarily</em> on hold.

I thought I had you there for a minute ;-). My bad.<br /><br />Amazingly enough, the audience was pretty cool about the immature title of the radio show that we were listening to and I must confess that I myself could not supress a chuckle here and there when the hosts of the show (perhaps overly) exploited the acronym in some amusingly creative fashion. In fact, I almost decided not to air it today until more thought was given to it... it is not my intention to offend. I think that the creators (who were probably making fun of another podcast entitled &#39;TWiT&#39; (This Week in Technology... which I wouldn&#39;t have known about if it weren&#39;t for this satire) chose the title (not only as a joke) but to draw attention to the fact that IT is still a very much male-dominated industry... and that many hacker meetings are doomed to become &quot;sausage fests&quot; if this is to continue. I sincerely believe that the creators of these shows do not want this to be the state of the industry and would love more people of the female sex to get involved thus increasing Humanity&#39;s Pool of Knowledge significantly, if not double, or triple. While we are talking about sex, I do not believe for a minute that the male and female brain are more or less adapted to deal with technologies or application of any type of tool by nature. It is an adament belief of mine that this is a <em>cultural</em> phenomenon and restriction which needs to be <span class="bbc_u">shattered</span> for the lie that it is despite of what the &quot;experts&quot; have projected onto their scientific studies and &quot;findings&quot;. Remember, that the Observer by necessity changes that which is Observed and this concept may extend to all data...including studies of the differences between the sexes and how our minds are supposed to work.<br /><br />My intent with today&#39;s &quot;programming&quot; was to introduce as many voices as could conveniently be crammed into the shortest period of time, while simultaneously paying close attention to the dictum of &quot;Content is King&quot;. IMHO we were successful, and were exposed to many various and useful bits of information. This temporally shortened form of media may in fact be conducive to economy of word, focus of idea, and easily digestable information/datagrams for consumption giving credence to the old cliche&#39; that one must chew one&#39;s food before swallowing. [Please vide John Malkovitch in the movie &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot;]<br /><br /><em>&quot;Brevity is the essence of wit.&quot;- free Linux distro to the first person who can tell me the original source of this quote.</em><br /><br />The program started out with Kizzle&#39;s radio show Uberleeto [can the &#39;o&#39; be considered a zero and :. silent?] I don&#39;t believe he maintains his website (http://www.uberleeto.com/) anymore but you can still check it out on the &quot;Wayback Machine&quot; sans the MSpaint project. In addition to creating hackermedia.net which is now hackermedia.org and for which we are all extremely grateful) he was one of the first if not the first to start the format of a little over five minute hacking show which may have been the progenitor of T.W.A.T. Radio, which is a daily... yes...DAILY, Hard-Core Tech Show.<br />It is my firm belief that if we can get past the name and learn the content of each show thoroughly then we will be well on our way towards a basic education of today&#39;s technology, or at least a spring board off of which to jump.<br />Skipping foward in time we listened to Jason Scott... and I am still trying to determine if he really went out to eat at all. Jason Scott is a preserver of BBS culture and also has a film out called BBS Documentary. Please check it out. Then we travelled back in time to the pilot episode of T.W.A.T., so that people could get a feel for the premise of the show (which I think we&#39;ll be playing alot more of in the future.) We also listened to the second episode of the new show Electrostuff, which I believe will save me mucho dinero in future. The last three episodes of the day covered some basic topics which we&#39;ll have to listen to a few more times to fully digest, but am sure that afterwards we will all be satiated. This is the food that some people starve for.<br /><br />Post show Geeky Conversation included:<br />we talked about the greatness of implementing a continuous ink supply for your printer replacing those expensive&nbsp; cartridges... which Electroman compared to the price of gasoline. There was talk of the first episode of Electrostuff where Elecroman implements a water cooling system for his computer and one of the members actually knows someone who instituted the water cooling device. We will have to investigate this further. [btw There are only two episodes of Elecrostuff as of now, so please give him some feedback and encourage him to produce more.]<br />After confessing that I needed a solution to sound problems, esp. dynamic range (playing so many shows of different qualities and changes in volume with each opening and closing music was quite annoying.

It was pretty busy at Freezepeach today and I was worried that there wouldn&#39;t be enough food. Thankfully the loaded cheese pies were more than filling; we even had a slice or two left over. For the Winter season we&#39;re thinking of initiating Soup (and so reconnect with our vegetarian roots) and bread (hopefully regionalized sourdough). We still need a way to healthily vegetatize the pies (eggs being the problematic binding ingredient). Merm is working on this (I hope), and no, today we didn&#39;t include bacon... my empty wallet saved us in this respect.<br />&nbsp; Again, I have to apologize to all the people who have ben hurt by AOL or the unfriendly commercialized puppetpeople of TechTv. (I really don&#39;t like name calling...especially if there is an indication that the offending parties may mean well (which may be problematic), but then again, how goes the olde saying about the metaphorical road to hell being paved with... what?)<br />&nbsp; Being an equal access media outlet we sometimes want to air people with whom we disagree, especially if there is information to be had or knowledge to be dealt, and I urge all you people out there who are offended by poisonous memes, propaganda and F.U.D. in general to write to these people and educate them on the true meaing of the word hacker. They may be receptive and discontinue their obseqiousness to the garbage which is Corporate Media. Then again, maybe not. Some of us are too entrenched in the hypnosis of Occlusion no matter how intelligent or clever we think we are. I am also a victim of figmentation at times, so I really understand. Thankfully I can accept criticism, though sometimes it really hurts, but, In the end I am thankful, grow, and move on (hopefully mending my ways... or maybe not [I am only human]).<br />&nbsp; Just remember people ... Corporate Crime and International Criminal Syndicate does Not equal Hacking or Hackers, though indeed some may have them in their employ as Crackers, just as they have every other sort of person in their employ, for example marketers in public relations to actual contract &quot;security&quot; personnel... maybe even you or me! (we are certainly buying into their lies; sometimes we have no choice, just as isolated from the world of information as someone born into the Klu Klux Klan!) In this world (in my own humble estimation) the so-called White Hats are the ones causing us (i.e. the consumer as well as the computer literati...{I fall into the consumer slot}) all of the annoying problems... only because of their <em>willingness</em> to please their masters. And it really isn&#39;t them who are causing problems like spam, etc. it is their employers who direct them. True freedom loving individuals <em>have</em> no masters.... for they do what is right by their own conscience, and actually take into consideration the possible repurcussions of their actions rather than blindly following &quot;the Book&quot;. Didn&#39;t Satan write a manual once? ;-) <br /><br />Hackers are not willing to change their name just for this reason. Back in the day some peverse individuals even hung, tortured and burned people because of their allegiance to certain deities, ideals or traditions. They even said that they were doing God&#39;s Work... and may have even believed it. In China during the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot; it was the intelligentsia (teachers and artists) who were targeted. This is not what freedom is all about..nor the un-obstructed perception of truth or &quot;clear-seeing&quot;. Our &quot;enemies&quot; are not necessarily words or stereotypes. They are not Symbols. They are in fact multidimensional human beings with feelings, lives and souls who breathe, love, hate, feel pain and walk upon the Earth. A little Charity here People! When I say charity, I really mean &quot;Caritas&quot;, which any of you who are fans of PKD should know about.<br /><br />I&#39;m going to end this weekly rant (please criticise or correct me if I have been unfair or inaccurate... or just plain annoying) by saying that I really do sense something <span class="bbc_u">good</span> in the air, and the &quot;special shouts&quot; that precede each writeup are there for a reason. It is my own humble way of giving recognition not only to the stellar lights in my life but to those who light the way for others as well by their charitable example. This thing is not necessarily about technology exclusively... It is about the people who use it and create it. People are important, and now is the time to stick together, vent our grievances and work together towards a better sort of Habitat; and one which hopefully is not inimical to Life.<br /><br />Yours from Interzone (&#39;twixt Heaven and Hell),<br />Zeno (content free)<br /><br />&quot;Microsoft is not the problem.

The first was a topic series... for example we&#39;ll air shows having to do exclusively with a specialized subject like Phreaking, Wireless or Cryptography, etc. spanning a few weeks until we have a good foundation from which to build from. This will give some sort of structure to the lunch. The other idea was possibly a round table discussion... which I would like to see materialize (which usually happens anyway) but I don&#39;t want people to feel as if they have to share or discuss anything on Monday if it is their intent to just eat a bit and relax. The lunch <em>is</em> kind of informal. As soon as I get off my lazy butt I&#39;m going to contact the speakers, who will probably <em>not</em> be presenting on Monday @ 12, but probably on Friday nights. This is still in the works.<br />&nbsp; Also later on the evening I talked with Wakasm who turned me on to the exciting pong .gif floating around out there. He also found a function on his tv remote that allowed it to act as a mouse. He enlightened me to a new keyboard that has been in developement for some time now but may have been slowed down due to patent b.s. (more later). It is called the Optimus keyboard which implements customizable LCD keys which you can view here (http://www.artlebedev.com/portfolio/optimus/). Their faq (http://www.artlebedev.com/portfolio/optimus/answers/). Very exciting. <br /><br /><strong><em>Projects...</em></strong><br />A few of them are in the works. The crew at Basenet suggested during episode 0x09 that there is a need for a dictionary of open-source terms. For example... how is GNOME pronounced... is it gee-nome, or nome, or ga-nome? Perhaps all three? Taking this a step further, I&#39;ve noticed that there is not alot of spoken word books out there having to do with tech, which needs to be remedied for those of us who are either blind or just digest information better via alternative channels. Perhaps this media will also serve to reinforce what we have read. I think that the Jargon file would be a good place to start and I&#39;m not sure what ARRL has available in this area as well.<br /><br /><strong><em>MK-Ultra Pong</em> update:</strong> Wakasm has found an amusing .gif which he posted here (http://astorians.com/index.php?topic=1041.0).<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 1.45em;" class="bbc_size"><em>Coming Soon...</em></span><br /><br /><div><span style="font-size: 2em;" class="bbc_size">Binary Revolution Radio Episode 91 - easy WEP cracking</span></div><br /><span class="bbc_u"><span style="font-size: 2em;" class="bbc_size">Props</span></span><br /><br />(http://www.ccc.de/congress/2004/fahrplan/speaker/images/170.jpg) (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0179969/)<br /><br /><strong>Errata:</strong> [We need your input for this section]<br /><br /><div>[Still Under Construction... where are my Legos?! :x]]</div>

Nervous that the people were there wouldn&#39;t be able to listen to the strong argument of Stank and nervous that we&#39;d scare the new customer away!&nbsp; Props again to Freezepeach for being so tolerant.<br />&nbsp; The episode itself towards the end delved into the high insecurity of WEP encrypted networks which was a continuation on last week&#39;s theme. It may be time to reconfigure our routers, especially if one is (let&#39;s say) a Bank!<br />&nbsp; As you should know by now, Adam Kosmin will be giving a talk at the Peach although not during the Brunch. I urge everyone in the community to attend as I feel this one is real important. <br /><br /><span style="font-size: 7pt;" class="bbc_size">Prep time: 00.00.00 Listening to:<br />Bagels again<br /><br /><em>comments</em>: </span><br /><br /><strong>Post Geeky Discussion:</strong> Not much; we were all kind of tired.

Or, continue with what you are doing except with the knowledge that there may be a better... even a <em>cheaper</em> way to process the world which surrounds you!<br /><br /><br /><strong>Pong update:</strong><br /><strong><em>MK-Ultra Pong</em></strong> [currently on hold]<br /><br /><strong>Errata and corrections:</strong> aka <em>anti-noetic packet injection</em><br />[Moved from Logistics and Random Notes section to here because lack of content /ED.]<br />O.k., well maybe this would have been better slotted under the &quot;Errata and corrections section&quot; but hey, what the hell... I&#39;m really not <em>retracting</em> anything I said about Leo Laporte and Friends but only saying sorry that I helped further divide (in my own insignificant way) a community that is already unprotected under Laws and inherently <em>already</em> divided. Information Society is all inclusive... no exceptions. Some may see this neutrality as smacking of coldness and androidal roboticism... but in this AI I see the light of truth and the birth of true empathy blossoming in an intelligence created by us that is perhaps (or has the potential to be) greater than our own. Maybe not now, but perhaps in the Realm of MoonPenney. Don&#39;t scoff! :-) We now know that the world of James Bond and Speculative Fiction has long since become reality (with only some major or minor exceptions in regards to details &lt;/smirk&gt;). And we all know what lurks in the Details!<br /><br />My point comes to a matter of degree. What does it matter if some Kook on a community Forums or website says that what Leo Laporte or friend says is assoholic? Or what does it matter when some 12 year old kid or dead grandmother decides that pirating an MPEG layer 3 file of Michael Jackson&#39;s &quot;Thriller&quot; or the brand new Britney Spears Audio Book on Tape &quot;Politics through Prosperity&quot; is a good idea? The fact of the matter is, that when we (pixie people) decide to slander, cheat or become negligent... the overall effects on the World is in fact... negligible. But when Leo Laporte or friend says (who boasts over a million downloads and has the receptive ear of corporations and perhaps even <em>governments</em>) that hackers are a danger to your personal privacy and public security or Michael Jackson goes on a &quot;love fest&quot; in Thailand or the RIAA/FCC/MPAA decides to co-opt an entire form of media or law of nature as it&#39;s own showpiece to auction-block off to the highest bidder at it&#39;s own pleasure... well then, it could be argued that the fallout is less than negligable.<br /><br />Back to my original (and heartfelt premise): Not only should Robin <em>Hood</em> (who stole from the Rich and dared to give to the Poor; iow England -ruling aristocracy) be utterly and completely <em>Eradicated</em> and utterly and completely <em>Erased</em> from History books, so should everyone who dared to support him or even talk with him be so ignominously treated. Guilt equals Guilt by Association... and well.. I guess that means everybody ;-).<br />Why, the possibility that such a person could exist is my own worst unwholesome Nightmare, and for the benefit of our Children and our Children&#39;s Children we should not only completely rewrite history we should destroy all fairy tale books as well. Why, if such an unsavory and arrogant individual existed in modern times he would no doubt be labeled a Terrorist... him and all his so-called deviant &quot;Merry&quot; Band of Pranksters. Well, with today&#39;s media this is not only possible but also (if I hear no word to the contrary) completely Acceptable.<br /><br />Don&#39;t get me wrong... the positive energy that I felt last week has not dissipated. In fact, not only has it survived (perhaps due to the unexpected invigorating Spring-like Weather ... why if we could only halt Global Warming at this juncture it would not only be tolerable but absolutley pleasurable!) it has blossomed into nothing less than Green Man fervor. The only obstacle that I forsee (in the face of an uncrushed opposition lingering on it&#39;s last legs of despair) is our own inherent illogic. IOW... why are we here? Why are we banding together? And why are we not making the legal changes necessary in becoming a full-fledged Political Group with their own supporting corporate and private sector lobbyists? Making sure that the laws that put people away for millenia are in fact informed laws based on necessity and a technically sound basis? CCC in Germany is way ahead of us in this department, and maybe a model to emulate. Why?<br /><br />Perhaps it is because tech people are by nature anathema to politics. I don&#39;t mean to criticize or point out the obvious... but isn&#39;t water (H2O) a Universal Solvent?<br />The proverbial Ball is in your Court.<br />[/size] will equal 7pt (or less) in &lt;7 days<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 2.65em;" class="bbc_size">Props...</span><br /><br />(http://www.cinefile.biz/rwan-cs1.jpg) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Rusesabagina)<br />Paul Rusesabagina and Don Cheadle<br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 7pt;" class="bbc_size"></span><div>[Perpetually ..Under ....&nbsp; &nbsp; ....&nbsp; &nbsp;...&nbsp; &nbsp;construction.......]</div>[/size]

I <em>am</em> an American Indian. However, releasing the pent up frustration concerning what I percieve to be people&#39;s apathy is in itself cathartic and helps me the next morning in finding more productive means in the way of solution finding in the context of long term problems, of which I am by no means excluded. I am a smoker, a drinker and a user of petroleum products just as much as anybody else. The glass house that I live in must be shattered, for the glass is clouded and keeps us in Occlusion.

Cheers. /Zen Content Free Operating System]</span><br /><br />P.S.: Also I want to note that these writeups tend not to make much sense unless you actually listen to the shows that they&#39;re about, concerning which, the links I have provided for those that are interested in the topic but can not make it to the lunch. As I said before, i am an absolute beginner or noob in this field and thought that it would be fun in learning such a pertinent and fascinating topic together and interesting as well in observing the baby-steps that were taken along the way. So again, in apologia, any information that appears comes from that of a student rather than someone that could be stupid enough to consider his humble self any kind of authority. I still look foward to people contributing... especially to the errata section. &amp; as far as the political stuff... well, I believe it to be important but it kind of just leaks in now and again almost against my will.

It has been noticed that even some experienced phreaks have not mastered it&#39;s use. Beige boxing hinges (afaik) on the special type of alligator clip called &quot;bed-of-nails&quot; which has a spike which is attached to the clip which effectively pierces the insulation of the wire coming into contact with the underlying cable. Some hackers give up when the alligator clip is attached and the box doesn&#39;t work and are easily discouraged. The fact of the matter is, is that the clip has to be pressed upon (and that with force) until the spike pierces the aforesaid insulation, being careful not to come into contact with the other alligator clip or otherwise complete the circuit which would inevitably invite an unpleasant &amp; shocking awakening. [Note: I am describing here or only regurgitating what I have been told, and have not actually experimented with this.

Again we congratulate the people behind this venue for their humanity, backbone, courage and commitment to making this world a better more easygoing place. How many other places can we enjoy this kind of freedom?<br /><br />Today&#39;s program is number II in a series of VI devoted to the topic of Phreaking, which will hopefully be crowned by I-baLL&#39;s presentation.&nbsp; I am constantly overwhelmed by just how much information is out there and by how little I know. SK put foward the idea that we should have more hands on type stuff, like the cryptographic handouts we had in the beginning or bringing in pieces of equipment that we could take apart and learn about. I like the idea of a cable oriented episode where we could learn about different forms of cable, what makes them work and teach people how to crimp.<br /><br />SK and I welcomed a newcomer to the hour who showed great interest in the topic. Starbucks being closed for renovations may have been the cause for this unexpected boon to our fledgling community. SK helped me out in my fumbling when asked what a hacker is and gave his own definition, which to me seemed pretty consistent with what was written earlier under this (now over-bloated) topic . After grievances being aired with MS Word in particular and proprietary software in general, interest was shown in downloading and installing Open Office.&nbsp; I am surprised by how quickly some people just &quot;get it&quot;. Also, it was suggested that it would perhaps be prudent when writing long letters or emails to do so first offline using a text editor (remembering to save periodically) and when finished, copying and pasting to the email right before sending.<br /><br />Afterwards we talked a little more about numismatic coins and why it would not be cost-effective for criminals to counterfeit gold proofs. Even though Gold (Au) and Lead (Pb) are close enough together on the periodic table, it was stated that the properites of Lead would not allow it to hold the same level of detail as gold among other things.<br /><br />Hung out with Wakasm for awhile and watched him take apart a PS2, and it wasn&#39;t until I tried helping him fish out a small screw that got stuck to the magnet near the optical device with improvised tweezers fashioned from an insulated paper clip ;-) that I noticed how badly my hands were shaking due to withdrawals so had to go home. <br /><br /><br /><strong>Linksystems:</strong><br />OpenOffice (alternative to MS Office suite): http://www.openoffice.org/<br />SKaReCRoW&#39;s page (still under construction): http://www.skarecrow.net/<br />Wakasm&#39;s Site: http://www.videogamebuddy.com/<br />There is another Mcast coming out of Astoria, but I haven&#39;t listened to it yet... so if you enjoy it tell us about it: http://www.thisshowagain.com/<br />To learn more about wax cylinders: http://www.tinfoil.com/<br />TELECOM Digest &amp; Archives: http://massis.lcs.mit.edu/<br />Voxio: http://www.voxioconsortium.com/home.html<br />Here is a most excellent site from a member of astorians that I never knew existed... until now; props Sorabji! http://www.payphone-project.com/<br /><br /><strong>Books, Magazines, Manuals &amp; other Media:</strong><br /><br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>&quot;Telecom Digest Jan 5th 1994 vol.14 Issue 7&quot;,<br />d3c0d3r made reference to this issue... search for &quot;issue 7&quot; (without the quotes)<br />http://massis.lcs.mit.edu/archives/back.issues/1994.volume.14/vol14.iss001-050</li><li>On the agressive telemarketer&#39;s number 416-214-9598: http://tinyurl.com/35d2f<br />(a warning was given not to call this number; but if anybody is brave enough...)</li><li>[I don&#39;t know the status of the following numbers]</li></ul><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">206-222-2585 Default Daily<br />206-333-1942 d3c0d3r&#39;s Personal mailbox<br />206-600-1839 Default Daily mirrored<br />----------<br />206-424-3217 Zydeco&nbsp; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zydeco<br />206-600-0687 Echos of the Past<br />206-736-2187 Area codes not in the continental U.S.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />[li]&quot;VLAN: Virtual Local Area Network and IEEE 802.1Q&quot; http://www.javvin.com/protocolVLAN.html[/li][/list]<br /><br /><strong>T.O.M.s (http://www.tomshardware.com/index.html) (<em>Terminological Offensive Maneuvers</em>):</strong> (GLOSSARY)<br /><br /><em>NPA</em> - Numbering Plan Area or &quot;area code&quot;<br /><br /><em>victrola</em> - Precursor of the CD-player ...

Thanks again for your patience.</span><br /><br />This glorious summer day...just kidding... found SK buying the bagels and zeno quite late because he set his alarm clock to ten o&#39;clock <span class="bbc_u">p</span>.m. The Sakais were present, and someone else who I&#39;ve talked to before but whose name escapes me. Jayme showed up a little later as well.<br /><br />&nbsp; We took a little break from the series (presently on the topic of phreaking) and relaxed to a staple of the community... good ole fashion &quot;Off the Hook&quot;. In my introductory remarks I stated that I&#39;ve been listening to Emmanuel Goldstein for many years before I knew that he was into the hacking/phreaking scene. His importance to me was (and is) in the role of a social commentator, a voice of criticism, tolerance and dissent. I have personally derived much strength from his words which came to me via Frequency Modulation on many different radios at many different times. For those of us in New York, we have a great opportunity to listen to the show live on the air as they broadcast from the Empire State building every Wednesday night on WBAI 99.5 FM. They also stream via mp3 and even simulcast by shortwave (WBCQ 7415khz) if you are so inclined. Despite being often criticized, the show does in fact feature alot of technical content... and I personally like the fact that they highlight this subject against a human framework or context. Emmanuel&#39;s other show &quot;Off the Wall&quot; is devoted purely to politics, ranting and news, and not surprisingly, my favored of the two. I will say that they are both good shows and deserving of attention whether you disagree with the hosts or not, for they cover much news of global importance that is many times conveniently &quot;overlooked&quot; by the major commercial outlets... another reason why I love and support WBAI. Earlier this year someone wrote a post criticizing them quite harshly (which is all well and good) but when I offered a challenge for the critic to suggest a better or more informed alternative there was sadly no reply. So it goes...<br />Here is a link to the thread (http://astorians.com/index.php?topic=674.0)... and yes... this tangent does concern technology. To save you time, it is four posts from the bottom. I am still waiting.<br /><br />There wasn&#39;t too much post-geeky discussion except that Jayme and I talked about World of Warcraft (which I&#39;ll probably begin playing) and which character classes I should choose from... which can definitely qualify as &#39;geeky&#39;. Which brings to mind a film that a friend sent to me via private messaging that I intended to link to last week. It&#39;s called &quot;Fear of Girls&quot; (http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7521044027821122670) (which I&#39;ll list again under the links section). Enjoy!&nbsp; :-) Note: The video starts playing right away when you follow the link... see below for a direct download.<br /><br />Special Note: It was mentioned during the show that if anyone is interested in having an alternative news service in the form of <span class="bbc_u">BBC World</span> appear for those who subscribe to Time Warner Cable or intend to subscribe, there is someone that you can write to concerning this (and be nice):<br /><br />Robert Watson, Vice President of Programming New Business Developement<br />c/o Time Warner Cable<br />120 E. 23rd Street, 9th Floor<br />New York, N.Y. 10010<br /><br />If you send &quot;Off the Hook&quot; a copy of your letter and we succeed in getting BBC World, Emmanual promises to compensate you somehow with some form of prize.

Also sleep deprivation. To make matters worse when the timer went off I didn&#39;t shut the oven off until right before I left... and while the pies did not burn there was not sufficient time for the tray that I carry them on the cool down! So I risked being frozen and scalded and falling down at the same time with pies of all things. How humiliating that would have been!

I can honestly say that not much happened in the way of discussion today except for an amusing debate that began to initiate between my good friend SK and another prospective member to our lunch who has experience with Apple computers. SK, you should know, is a straight-up Linux guy. And while X (I have to get his handle later) showed no interest in debate he defended his OS of choice with conviction. While I must side with people like Adam Kosmin on this issue due to the ethics of proprietary software, I am still curious to know more about Apple&#39;s technology and practices and hope that X will be able to give a presentation himself on the subject.

I-Ball has yet to give his presentation, but please forgive us because I am sure that everyone can empathize with the hectic nature of unforgiving schedules. In choosing PLA Radio (which is in fact a new venture) by the people from the well established &amp; renowned Phone Loosers of America I felt that I could not go wrong... which btw went over very, very well. The crowd at the Peach today really seemed to get into the show as the content IMO was not only hilarious but very informative as well.<br /><br />&nbsp;Even though this is the end of a planned series, Phone Phreaking is a very large and involved topic which we will be treating again in the future. The nature of the telephone system is so intertwined with today&#39;s society and so ubiquitous that it is easy to take for granted and as a result this glaring achievment in technological innovation (now approaching 2 centuries old) which has indelibly changed the face of human history is easily overlooked. Everyone knows what a telephone is... but I believe that only a handful actually knows <em>how</em> it works or why it may be vital to have this knowledge.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Linksys:</strong><br /><br />http://www.stoprelayabuse.com/<br />http://www.phonelosers.org/<br /><br /><strong>Books, Magazines, Manuals &amp; other Media:</strong><br /><br /><strong>T.O.M.s (http://www.tomshardware.com/index.html) <br />(<em>Terminological Offensive Maneuvers</em>):</strong> (GLOSSARY)<br /><br />phone mobbing:<br /><br />voice bridge:<br /><br />relay operator:<br /><br />prank call:<br /><br />lemon party:<br /><br /><strong><em>Projects...</em></strong> <br /><br /><strong>Pong update:</strong><br /><strong><em>MK-UltraPong</em></strong> <br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15pt;" class="bbc_size">Props</span><br /><br /><br /><strong>Errata:</strong><br /><br />[Massively <strong>Under Construction</strong>]

The creator is a great guy who resides in Phoenix, Arizona whom I personally admire and is even a member and contributor to our humble forums here in Astoria. Don&#39;t let the cultural content of the episodes deceive you, XlogicX has a strong background in technology and is well respected in the hacking scene. I feel he wanted to do something different, so every month for 26 minutes there appears a show in which content is king and b.s. &amp; dead air is kept to a minimum if not outright eliminated. The shows that really grabbed me were the shows about logic (reflecting his namesake)... which does btw have profound technological implications... but has more important value IMHO when it comes to hacking wetware, in other words, in how we think.<br /><br />&nbsp; So if you missed today&#39;s brunch or found the information difficult to absorb during the first run through, go home and listen to them again... yes all 26 minutes of it!, and tell me that before you did so you weren&#39;t seriously deprived. The tools you will be exposed to just may save your life one day or if you happen to work in the Executive Branch of the U.S. Government may even prevent a holocaust. Then the next step is to write him a letter (he even read one by me!) and tell him what you think. He welcomes intelligent criticism as well as positive feedback, and spatial distances nonwithstanding, he <em>is</em> a part of this Community, so go ahead, show him your support as I have repeatedly suggested when it comes to all Free Radio.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Linksys:</strong><br /><br />http://antimeme.org/<br />http://www.phx2600.org/<br /><br /><br /><strong>Books, Magazines, Manuals &amp; other Media:</strong><br /><br /><strong>T.O.M.s (http://www.tomshardware.com/index.html) <br />(<em>Terminological Offensive Maneuvers</em>):</strong> (GLOSSARY)<br /><br />Here is a link to a topic already strated on this forum on this subject<br /><br />logic:<br /><br />premise -&gt; inference -&gt; conclusion (the &quot;therefore&quot;)<br /><br />input -&gt; processing -&gt; ouput<br /><br />GIGO<br /><br />premise:<br /><br />conclusion:<br /><br />inference:<br /><br />proof:<br /><br />axiom:<br /><br />validity:<br /><br />invalidity:<br /><br />soundness:<br /><br />unsoundness:<br /><br />truth table:<br /><br />fallacy:<br /><br />modus ponens (mode that affirms):<br /><br />distributive property:<br /><br />atomic symbols:<br /><br />AND:<br /><br />IF:<br /><br />OR:<br /><br />XOR:<br /><br />exclusive OR:<br /><br />inclusive OR:<br /><br /><strong><em>Projects...</em></strong> <br /><br /><strong>Pong update:</strong><br /><strong><em>MK-UltraPong</em></strong> <br /><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size"><em>Coming Soon...</em></span><br /><br /><div><span style="font-size: 15pt;" class="bbc_size">BINARY REVOLUTION MEETINGS @ THE CITIBANK BUILDING</span></div><br />Details: Binrev Meeting 212 is being set for the third Friday of every month in the same locale &amp; time as the 2600 meetings.

				Title: <strong>Tech Brunch Update -Tech Brunch is on Hiatus-</strong><br />
				Post by: <strong>zeno</strong> on <strong>March 20, 2006, 01:49:14 AM</strong>

				Fellow Astorians,<br /><br />It is with great sorrow to announce that our fledgling Tech Brunch&#39;s evolution must go on temporary hiatus. The reason for this interruptus comes from the Realm of the Mundane and concerns a little thing which I like to refer to (euphemistically)as workenslavement whose ultimate aim is none other than the pursuit of bio-survival tickets which can just about purchase an empty existence in a shallow society.<br /><br />Let us remember the proposition that all true &quot;progress&quot;, technological or otherwise takes root and blooms in a &quot;leisure society&quot; and since leisure societies until now are founded on the exploitation of those who find themselves unfortunate enough not to own oil companies, it is here where I must do my part. And while I am I will continue to dream of a sustainable agriculture, a Land where the fruits of labor are equal to or greater than the time of labor. :-)<br />&nbsp; Before you scoff... there <em>is</em> evidence in the field of Anthropology that some such cultures have indeed existed (until recently, that is).<br /><br />If Fortune is ... well er.. fortunate towards me and the other consistent attendees of our hour, then later on in the year Fate will find this thing not only more organized, informative and entertaining... but perhaps even better executed.<br /><br />I&#39;ve learned alot from this little venture and in contradistinction to one valuable friends comment that I&nbsp; also &quot;have a life&quot;, I must respond that things such as these which are not tied solely to amorous relationships or work related survival stuff are in fact the better aspects of our lives. In other words... the things which we enjoy doing... not have to do.<br /><br />In the mean time... there are plenty of shows to relisten to, and far far many more to be exposed to as well as many many words yet to be defined, mulled over and eventually grasped, i.e. assimilated into our very living organic brain tissue as well as countless questions to be asked if not ultimately answered. So, if you are rich and can afford barrels of audio tapes at Barnes &amp; Nobles because the public library can&#39;t, or you happen to like commercial radio or tv where there are more ads than actual content... then more power to you. Just remember that there is a universe of free information out there; &quot;free&quot;, as in no fee needs to be attached to measure it&#39;s value and Free as in, you are free to say and listen to what you want without censure. But then again maybe this term itself needs to be &quot;redefined&quot;.<br /><br />Good luck! and hope to see you all again real soon!<br /><br />-Zeno<br /><br />P.S.: If any of you has any ideas on how to make Technological Brunch more better (or even more logical) in the future, please don&#39;t hesitate to email me at zeno63217@gmail.com&nbsp; All ideas or criticisms will be welcome.<br /><br />Note: Meesh gratefully agreed to keep the hour going provided that I select and burn the show to CD. I thought I could do this... but my schedule is such that all things not immediately linked to my immediate survival must for the moment be kept out of focus. Thank you for your understanding.
