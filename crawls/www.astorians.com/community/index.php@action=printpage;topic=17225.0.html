				<br />Based on very little, it seems Gilli would have a 2-1 advantage over a Dem challenger.<br />Still that seems enough to suggest there should be a primary to have Kirsten earn the statewide nomination.<br /><br />Dems, would you want to see a primary? Or would you rather forego it and simply have Gilli prepare for the general election contest?<br /><br />Not related, I thought there was quite&nbsp; a good article on how journalists should do a better job of covering challengers.<br />One never knows when a contest may actually become a contest.<br /><br />I am keeping hope open for further challengers.<br />[I also am considering that it appears Dems will be looking to keep majorities. If that is actually the case, voters should consider how strongly they want to keep incumbents and which ones. I would welcome a split NY delegation, but it depends on which newcomer.]<br /><br /><br />http://www.kirstengillibrand.com/issues/

				Here in Astoria, Ms. Saujani is promoting herself as the voice of recent immigrants.&nbsp; I had two questions about her: 1) why is she challenging Carolyn Maloney instead of some mediocrity elsewhere in the city, and 2) how is she promoting herself in Manhattan?<br /><br />I suppose now I have the answer to both questions.

				When I first heard about Reshma Saujani I was pretty excited. I like Maloney but she&#039;s been in office for like, 17 years and I think that&#039;s just too long. But the more I got to know about Saujani, the less I liked her. I mean, it&#039;s not like Maloney has never taken a dime from big business or anything but Reshma Saujani just seems way too proud of the Wall Street chicanery that messed up our economy.

				I&#039;ve met Congresswoman Maloney several times. She&#039;s actually been to Astoria a lot over the last year--I&#039;m surprised she&#039;s found so much time for our neighborhood given the size of her district.<br /><br />I support primary elections on principle, especially in districts where the special election is essentially uncontested. Voters deserve a choice and Reshma Saujani deserves a fair hearing. But in this match-up, I support Carolyn Maloney and that&#039;s who I&#039;ll be casting my vote for in September.

Strangely, I like Chris Matthews. He is often though boorish and treats so many guests this way.<br />Reshma must be glad for the exposure. I did not, would not watch the whole segment.<br /><br />She largely said talking points and slogans and did not give policy answers. She pointed out the low income housing in our area and the high level of unemployment. Does she have proposals for job creation? Why would Wall Streeters be supporting her campaign, to what ends?<br /><br />And somehow Maloney has millions in her funding as well. My belief is that voters should seek fresher minds and not have incumbents remain in DC for very long periods.<br />But the control of the House might possibly change this election and voters should take that into consideration as well.<br /><br /><br />Found one good proposal so far from Reshma, hope to see if there would be any others.<br />[I lost a typed message and might have more to add another time.] Good luck to all.

				You&#039;re welcome TRX.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have a problem if Chris Matthews calls her out on something she says, but berating and cutting her down during the whole interview is a disservice to viewers who might want to learn about the candidate.&nbsp; If he spoke that way to Carolyn Maloney, the DNC might be calling for an apology right now.<br /><br />Reshma Saujani isn&#039;t my cup of tea, but I don&#039;t think her background in Wall Street should be taken as a liability.<br />

				I&#039;m never as concerned by who is getting the PAC donations as how they are voting.&nbsp; If I saw a direct correlation between a PAC espousing positions with which I disagreed giving an elected official money and saw the elected official start voting in line with the PAC I&#039;d be less likely to support the elected official.&nbsp; Carolyn Maloney does get PAC money, most incumbents do, it&#039;s the nature of our flawed system.&nbsp; She does, however, stand up against the special interests that sometimes donate to her - the banking industry (which is bankrolling Saujani) HATES Maloney, for the Credit Card Bill of Rights and for opposing their abuse of customers.&nbsp; I&#039;m glad she&#039;s down in DC fighting for us.
