				hey... i hate to be the buzz killing math teacher of the group<br />but going for not so cheap tapas with a large group of people who you don't know very well sounds like a bill paying nightmare waiting to happen. &nbsp;<br />We've done pretty well at places where we all ordered the same thing - or where plates of food obviously went to certain people. &nbsp;If someone orders a salad and another orders an app, an entree two desserts and 6 drinks... we've been able to handle it. &nbsp;I'm just picturing bad blood at check paying time when we go split the price of 45 small dishes between meat eaters... vegetarians... salad only please... and 6 cocktails... It's giving me a headache already. <br /><br />Am I the only one feeling this way?? SPeak up. &nbsp;Call me a buzz killer. &nbsp;Get it out there... I'd like to hear back. &nbsp;Maybe I'll just go and sit at a separate table and watch. &nbsp;You all can say &quot;we told you so&quot;

				mundo is excellent but slow and maybe not good for a crowd. &nbsp;<br /><br />Its a tough time of year money wise for people, how about something reasonable and easy like a pub OR a potluck dinner at someones home.<br /><br />The best part about these dinners has been everyone getting together and enjoying the evening.<br /><br />So lets think up a list of appropriate places to eat:<br />dim sum in chinatown one saturday or sunday<br />cronins pub bway and 38th street<br />mexican in the neighborhood<br /><br /><br />any word on prices for mussels / fries and beer at the new place on ditmars across from 718? &nbsp;that sounds fantastic.

				Les Moules seems overpriced to me, but maybe that's just because I know how cheap mussels are. &nbsp;Their mussels entrees are in the $17 to $19 price range, if I recall. &nbsp;They have a website with menus, but I can't locate it offhand. &nbsp;I have their card at home but not here at work. &nbsp;If I figure out the website, I'll post it.<br /><br />The other thing I find odd about their menu is that their non-mussel section has a kind of &quot;one of everything&quot; approach - one chicken dish, one salmon dish, one steak dish, etc. &nbsp;I also don't think there are many, if any, vegetarian options on the menu. &nbsp;Also, their menu doesn't have a tapas section, even though they describe themselves as &quot;mussels and tapas&quot;. &nbsp;Instead, you are apparently served &quot;a selection of tapas&quot; either before or with your meal.<br /><br />None of my comments relates in any way to the quality of the food, by the way - I haven't eaten there. &nbsp;For all I know it's great and worth every penny.<br /><br />My weird vibe about the place may just be that it seems to be cursed as a restaurant spot. &nbsp;Who else remembers Ditmars Video?

				The Thai place is quite good, but maybe not the best for a crowd? Les Moules is significantly bigger, with a better bar &nbsp;:wink: , so maybe that would be better? I and my SO went there once, right after they opened. It was uneven, with really good steak, but a really bland something else I forget. Good Belgian beer. Trying-too-hard service that hopefully got better with practice. I'm pretty sure I and my SO could make it on the 16th...<br /><br />&nbsp;-Harlan

				So.... <br />where are we going???<br /><br />I can't say I noted any sort of consensus. <br /><br />I feel guilty b/c I broke up the plan to go to El Boqueron - but I didn't replace it with a plan. &nbsp;<br /><br />so maybe everyone who is planning to go.... when is this dinner??<br />says where they want to go....<br /><br />Basureror??? I know that's not the name of it... but the new place on Steinway just south of broadway. &nbsp;It's big. &nbsp;Has drinks and NO ONE has been there yet b/c it just opened. <br /><br />Jen
