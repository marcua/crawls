				A friend who lives down Broadway was a bit surprised with .... manhole cover fires yesterday. Whole street block off and about a dozen pieces of equipment. Great, thought they said this was fixed.<br /><br />Talked to some fire fighters and they said the holidays (the lights?) are taxing the system ... This was not their only call that night. <br /><br />He recognized one of the Con Ed guys from the neighborhood who said next year is going to be a long summer with all the new loads put on the system. Said Astoria desperately needs a substation. A big substation.<br /><br />Lets see .... along the waterfront? Eagle Electric? Sterns Warehouse? <br /><br />or some schlubs backyard? <br /><br />&nbsp;

				Yea, I like lights too, especially the bright ones.....<br /><br />http://www.astorians.com/index.php?topic=4336.0<br /><br />So my information was correct. Anyone else have problems?<br /><br />Lets hope that once the salt gets in there in late winter we don&#39;t have a real disaster.<br /><br />

				Gleason, as usual, when it comes to power issues in Astoria anyone looking for answers is getting their leg pulled by those &quot;in the know.&quot; <br /><br />1. How about heaters in all those illegally converted basements turned on at the same time? A cold snap and there goes the neighborhood. <br /><br />2. Which leads to the next point. Why no one came out to the hearings? The property owners are keeping their heads low. Every other building is illegally converted! <br /><br />Another reason for us to thank those responsible for our community&#39;s unique legacy. For decades illegal conversions have been Astoria&#39;s all but official public policy. Now we get zapped summer and winter!<br />
