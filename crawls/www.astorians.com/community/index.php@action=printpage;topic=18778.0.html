				Does anyone have any information on the body that was found under Hellgate bridge this morning? With all the strangers visiting our park to beat the summer heat, I am getting a bit nervous. There are quite some intimadating folks out and about. Not that I wish death on anyone, my hope is it was natural causes and nothing more ominous. <br /><br />Any info would be appreciated!<br /><br />Thanks and be safe!

				Thats what I was afraid of. The cops would not say anything to me either. I figured it might be a homeless person who died of the heat, hence their non chalance. I hope thats all it was. I do know there is a bit of drug activity further over by the con ed plant.<br /><br />Everyone needs to keep an extra set of eyes open! Please be safe everyone!

				I&#039;ve always felt safe there, even while running at night (up to 10 or 11pm.) But the police station in the park doesn&#039;t really help: When I once noticed a guy exposing himself, I told the cops there, and they seemed a little blasé about the whole thing. &quot;That&#039;s a gay pickup area, isn&#039;t it?&quot; was the cop&#039;s response. I was like, &quot;That doesn&#039;t make it legal!! KIDS are over there, too!!&quot;&nbsp; :-(<br /><br />Such a shame. This town seems perpetually caught b/w seedy and trendy.

				Having lived across the street from the Park for twelve years now, I can say that I have never witnessed the amount of crowds, noise, trash etc. as this year.&nbsp; A couple of reasons may be that other pools in the city have closed and Astoria Pool has attracted more people and that there has been a long heatwave simultaneously.<br /><br />Shore Blvd should be renamed Sh-t Blvd.&nbsp; It is truly disgusting.&nbsp; I agree that it should be closed to cars.<br /><br />The line for the pool goes right down to Hoyt Avenue now and they stand on the sidewalk.&nbsp; I picked up six bags of trash in one morning which was only stuff left in the gutters for three blocks.&nbsp; I was especially disgusted by the amount of dirty diapers.<br /><br />This has to end soon or Astoria will experience a turnaround and people will begin to move out.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am now worried about the skateboard park again and the potential for blasting music all night.<br />

				When I was younger -- late teens or so -- we would all drive our cars and hang out on Shore Blvd. It&#039;s an Astoria tradition. I&#039;d like to think, though, that we were more respectful than the people down there now. It was back in the day when the guidos would drive their Monte Carlos and Camaros slowly along the strip to check out the girls. Maybe I was just a dumb teen, but it seemed much safer back then -- no one was looking for trouble, just someplace to go and hang out on a hot summer night. The rocker guys also had their areas, and there was rarely any trouble. Music has always blasted from the cars, but there was more of a respect for authority -- if the cops came and said to turn it down, it was turned down. <br /><br />I know I find myself getting grouchier at the ripe old age of 40, and maybe I am overreacting to the new kids that are hanging on the strip, but things really do seem to have gotten worse lately. Such a shame. It&#039;s a great area to walk down in the evening, but I just don&#039;t feel as safe as I used to.

				Terrible news. My questions is why isn&#039;t there a curfew at Astoria park like most other parks? Midnight should be the cut-off, after that trespassers should be arrested. Other parks strictly enforce park curfew rules. This would resolve the ongoing noise problem coming out of the park, and reduce crime.

				I don&#039;t think a curfew is the answer. Some people like to take a late walk, exercise very early. Since I&#039;ve been here, 9 or 10 years, I never felt at risk in the park. Shore Blvd. <strong>is </strong>out of control though and should be closed after 10 p.m. I can&#039;t believe the people living around the perimeter haven&#039;t banded together on this. The stereos alone are insane, plus the motorcycle engines, etc. This creates an atmosphere of &quot;anything goes.&quot; If the cops continually quell this stuff---prohibit it-- these types will get the message. They&#039;ll go elsewhere. <br /><br />Wow. Right under hellgate. What a wake up call. We are living in the city after all.&nbsp; Well, rest in peace.

				First off, this is a terrible tragedy, and we all hate to see it happen in our own neighborhood... such a shame. <br /><br />Secondly, I think we need to curb knee-jerk reactions calling for closing down of shore blvd. To be honest, when I have been there walking my dog late at night, it&#039;s the fact that people are around that makes me feel safe. While I do think the loud music and cars/bikes etc does pose a problem, I&#039;m pretty sure that there is only one obvious solution: <strong>More police, and not just that, but more police who give a sh*t</strong><br />I have seen cops drive by cars blasting music at unreasonable levels at 2AM there and just keep going like there isn&#039;t a problem with that. I&#039;m ok with people being around at whatever hour of the night, it&#039;s there prerogative to do so. If police aren&#039;t there and enforcing, however, people can just get away with whatever they please without fear of consequence. If there were a noted police presence there, and people in the area didn&#039;t feel like they could get away with doing whatever, this incident may have been preventable. <br /><br />I love Astoria, and even in the midst of this, I still feel safe walking around alone here at night- it&#039;s part of why I love this neighborhood so much. I hope this incident is a kick in the arse for local authorities to serve as a reminder that cops aren&#039;t parking ticket dispensers, and that their job first and foremost is to keep our citizens safe. The only way that can happen is if cops are around and they give a sh*t about what they do.

				Totally true , born and raised in Astoria , around the mid 80&#039;s till the early 90&#039;s the strip was the place to go on a warm summer night . You would get a great breeze and it was bumper to bumper full of guidos in irocs and eldorados pumping freestyle . And guido doesnt mean Italian only , guido was the way you dressed the music you loved and danced to&nbsp; and the Silver Screens and Papagalos night clubs on steinway everyone went to . You could be latino, greek ,&nbsp; or anything at all .&nbsp; Most of the freestyle artists were puerto ricans and they called themselves guidos .&nbsp; So nothing to get upset about .&nbsp; Anyway the park was great and it was so much safer . Now you have guys in groups of 50 with rice burners&nbsp; pouring oil on their back tire to create smoke and peel out . Cops do nothing abt it at all . Its like they drive by just to look at whatever girls happen to be with these losers .Back then if a cop drove by and told you to lower the volume you did&nbsp; and that was that . Now its like&nbsp; the cops themselves are scared someone is gonna take a gun out on them /

				From a noise perspective- I can see why people would want to close down Shore Blvd to Traffic.<br /><br />From a safety perspective- I&#039;m sorry but I think that&#039;s a terrible idea. The traffic going through there means more eyes around, whether they be bikers, or couples doing late night cruising. Think about it: Criminals are more apt to do criminal activity where they won&#039;t be seen. Look at that stretch of Shore Blvd between Ditmars and 21st Ave. Yes, it&#039;s nice and quiet there, but if I saw a group of suspicious characters there, and a group of suspicious characters near a heavily trafficked main stretch of Shore Blvd, I&#039;d be more comfortable walking by the main area of Shore Blvd. <br /><br />I said it earlier in the thread, and I&#039;ll say it again. <strong>More police presence</strong>, and not just presence, but also <strong>enforcement</strong>. If these people think that cops don&#039;t give a crap(And it currently seems like they don&#039;t), obviously, they&#039;ll be more prone to blast loud music, rev their engines, etc. <br />I think it should be within anyone&#039;s right to hang out in public areas whenever they please, as long as it&#039;s not a disturbance or safety risk to others.

				Aren&#039;t most murder victims killed by someone they know?&nbsp; If that&#039;s true, and true in this case, then location is irrelevant; the guy was going to be killed somewhere.&nbsp; To get the park cleaned, in any sense of the word, I think people who use the park regularly have to bcome old fashioned big mouths and sound off in a unitd manner to every relevant agency.

				@JoeyC: I have not been in the nabe as long as you, but those things that happened in the 70&#039;s, I&#039;ve heard about from long time neighbors. I guess this area used to be rife with crime. The point is, we are no longer in the 70&#039;s and if people shrug their shoulders and pass this off as a sort of &quot;city&quot; thing that just happens, then I fear we can expect to go straight back to the 70&#039;s. (I suppose there is a reason they shot Serpico with Pacino under that bridge back in the 70&#039;s!..the setting fir the nature of the story)<br /><br />I toally agree the park should be open 24-7, especially in this economy when many families cannot afford AC, or as you point out, people who work late hours....It&#039;s the filth that comes to visit and mess our home up that drives me crazy to no end. <br /><br />We live in the best neighborhood in NYC and I welcome the visitors; it helps our area businesses, but at what cost to our quality fo life and now our safety?<br /><br />If you allow hoodlums to run wild with the cops not truly giving a damn, then this is what ya get!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Recently, I have noticed people sleeping in the park (I mean with sheets and everything!). &nbsp;I thought it was a sign of the times and considered calling the precinct. &nbsp;Also, there are cars parked overnight in the parking lot, the majority of which have license plates from other states. &nbsp;<br /><br />Several times, I have noticed the cars in the lot at night and the same cars are there in the AM. &nbsp;The reason I noticed these cars is because there are people lying down in them, they are pretty old and they have licenses from other states.<br /><br />I have informed Peter Vallone&#039;s office about this because we do not want it to become a trend. &nbsp;We want a safe park and a safe neighborhood.

				Hi TJT:<br /><br />How do you know the killers were &quot;homeless&quot;? What evidence have you heard about this or is it simply conjecture on your part? There are homeless people (like families who lost their shirts in the financial crisis) and then there are bums&nbsp; but there is a MASSIVE difference between the two...and not a single bit evidence exists as far as I know that either &quot;without a home&quot; group were responsible for Mr. Vargas&#039; murder.

				OK - just to be clear, the thread had strayed a bit from the actual murder more towards park safety and the homeless in general.&nbsp; That is what I was speaking to.&nbsp; I never meant to label the people who committed this crime in any way.&nbsp; But I agree about the unintended positive outcome.&nbsp; However, that will only be temporary.&nbsp; Increased awareness and a bit of a shift in thinking will help keep the area safer for the long term.

				I am going to stray as well - sorry, but it is a nice hopeful story about a well known Astoria homeless Woman, who I personally referred to as Athena, because she was always raging at someone, wearing too much make-up in pink blazers and all manner of gawdy accessories fished from the trash. She was consantly screeching like a condor, fighting her boyfriend and generally being a hot jim beam fueled car crash spewing filth in English, Greek and Drunkalese. A group of Greek residents and business owners arranged to have her flown back to Greece, where she received medical treatment, was given assisted living quarters and is now living a normal happy sober life in Athens. An acquaintance of mine who was involved showed me a picture of her that was sent to him. She looked really sensational. Like a different human being. So I think even the worst of our local whatever we should call them can change if given the tools. I know not at all of them want to change, but at least she did, and better yet, she really did get better. So for those whoever wondered where she went to....there ya go

				When there are less&nbsp; people, usually places were&nbsp; safer. Astoria was safer more quiet and in many ways a nicer&nbsp; small&nbsp; town&nbsp; next to Manhattan, when I was growing up.

She was consantly screeching like a condor, fighting her boyfriend and generally being a hot jim beam fueled car crash spewing filth in English, Greek and Drunkalese. A group of Greek residents and business owners arranged to have her flown back to Greece, where she received medical treatment, was given assisted living quarters and is now living a normal happy sober life in Athens. An acquaintance of mine who was involved showed me a picture of her that was sent to him. She looked really sensational. Like a different human being. So I think even the worst of our local whatever we should call them can change if given the tools. I know not at all of them want to change, but at least she did, and better yet, she really did get better. So for those whoever wondered where she went to....there ya go<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I remember that woman. Her BF is still around.
