				I used to have a two bedroom top floor of a railroad house here in Astoria for a few years. &nbsp;I had a difficult time looking for roommates and after one of the roommates stiffed me for several months rent I decided I no longer want the responsibility of being the lease holder. Currently I have a room that I am renting, but it is very small and not where I want to stay. &nbsp;I am looking for a somewhat permanent place where it looks like the living situation is fairly stable and the room size is something close to 10 x 10. I prefer Astoria because I have been here for a while and have made some friends. &nbsp;As I am sure you know it is difficult moving to a totally new area and having to re-associate your self again, although I am sure some of the friends I have made would stick with me if I move away.<br /><br />As far as what I am like as an individual..humm well, I am a very quite, and relaxed person and generally pretty accommodating. I do like to cook, but I am serious about a clean kitchen; mostly because I can’t cook and eat in a dirty one. I enjoy reading and I am starting to dabble in writing, more as a physiological therapy than anything else. New York proves to be a good place for writers as that it offers an array topics, characters and scenarios with which to play. I use to be an avid hiker and so I find myself longing to go out into the woods. So you may hear me referencing a hiking trip more that I go. I have found New York a difficult place to cultivate a group of hikers who want to go frequently and can all coordinate their schedules. To supplement this passion I have reverted to a childhood pastime of rock climbing. For some reason climbers seem to be more willing to spend extra time in the woods. <br /><br />There are some other things you are going to be interested in knowing. I have been freelancing software development for control systems for a little over four years. I have in that time been able to stabilize the issues involved with freelancing, like variable income and time allotments in the house. I know from previous attempts when I first moved to the city that many people looking for a roommate do not like people who freelance. That was actually one of the original reasons I had gotten my own place. I had come back from staying in Brazil for several months and had given up the last place that I was renting to save money. When I started looking again for a place (this was a couple of years ago) I found a pretty stiff prejudice to the notion that I was freelancing. In any case I want to reassure you that I am financially stable as a freelancer. After four years I have a reasonable clientele, I have learned to manage my finances between the good and not so good months. After this much time doing it I can say I am pretty secure in my situation. As far as time that I spend working out of my room it would be around 30% of the time. Half of the time I am in the field testing and installing the software, just because that is the nature of control systems software and the other twenty percent I usually go to an array of coffee houses because I go stir crazy in my room otherwise. On a serious upside I should say from past experience (not all roommates are prejudice against freelancers) that freelancing is a positive when it comes to scheduling arrangements for household appliances like cooking and showering, because it is usually very easy for me to work around someone else’s schedule, making the morning rush for the shower a little easier for everyone else in the household.<br /><br />On a lighter note I am from originally from California in a small small town of Idylwild, (about 450 people back then) &nbsp;which is near Palm Springs. Then I moved to Hawaii and lived there for quite some time on the North Shore in a place called Haleiwa. While I never developed my skill as a surfer I did learn to like scuba diving and became an avid mountain biker. Hawaii is a great place for mountain biking and polo, just one of those weird little known facts. Polo was too expensive for me. My plan in moving to New York was to expand and develop myself as a programmer (which I have fairly well succeeded) and now that I am here I also hope to develop myself as a writer. While staying in New York is not critical to being successful in either field it has been a good place for me to focus on my objectives. By looking for a fairly permanent place to live that means that I have not made up my mind to stay forever in New York. If I get to that point I suppose I will start to look for a place I could purchase and settle down in..hahaha I love that phrase “settle down” is so full of connotations. Anyway I hope this is not too much information but I felt like it would be good for you to get a sense of who I am. Oh by the way I am not dashing nor debonair, although I love to portray some of my characters that way.<br /><br />Hope to hear from you.

				Hey, I think mountain bike polo may have started in Hawaii. &nbsp;Stinger's post is jogging my memory. &nbsp;I have a scientist friend who loved to play it when she lived in Berkeley.<br /><br />Good luck with the apt. search, you! &nbsp;If I hear of anything, I'll let you know.
