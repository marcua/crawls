				Greetings,<br /><br />As a result of moving to a new server several Astorians members have inquired about ways that they can help support Astorians.com<br /><br />Wasabisam and I have come up with three ways that members can help.<br /><br />1. Donate (https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=support%40astorians%2ecom&amp;item_name=Donation%20to%20Astorians%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=1&amp;return=http%3a%2f%2fwww%2eastorians%2ecom%2findex%2ephp%3ftopic%3d3234%2e0&amp;cancel_return=http%3a%2f%2fwww%2eastorians%2ecom%2findex%2ephp%3ftopic%3d3234%2e0&amp;cn=Your%20Astorians%2ecom%20Username%3a&amp;currency_code=USD&amp;bn=PP%2dBuyNowBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8) - The most direct way to make a difference. 100% of donations go directly to support the site.<br />2. Visit our online store (http://www.printfection.com/astoria) - Approximately 20% of all sales made through this store go to support Astorians.com. We&#39;ll be adding new products periodically so check back often!<br />3. Host your website on the Astorians.com server - Send a PM (http://www.astorians.com/index.php?action=pm;sa=send) to merm if you are interested in sharing server space.<br /><br />More information: Astorians.com is hosted on a Virtual Dedicated Server, which means we have guaranteed resources and cannot be kicked off or slowed down by other random sites (like was happening on our old &quot;shared with thousands of other sites&quot; server). The yearly operating cost for this server is approximately $600 and it&#39;s our goal to keep the site banner-ad free. Donations, and sales that are made on this site will first go directly to support the cost of operating the server. Should there be funds available after all existing operating expenses are met, extra funds will be applied first to upgrading the server or software should there be a need, or towards the following year&#39;s hosting expenses. Should there be funds after all base costs, and upgrade costs are met then the remainder may either be held for future possible expenses, or used by merm to purchase Chinese takeout after many hours of working on the server keeping things updated. :)<br /><br />Thanks to all who have expressed interest in supporting this site! If you do decide to support, please let us know by posting here!

				Thought I&#39;d publish some stats to show how we&#39;ve been growing over the last few months for anyone who is interested. <br /><br />We&#39;ve gone from having 806 unique visitors, to nearly 5,500 as of last month. We&#39;ve gone from 3,200 visits to almost 20,000 visits. The total &quot;hits&quot; to the server has gone from 231,000 in March, to over 2.4 million hits last month. It&#39;s been a great month for us! Here&#39;s the raw data compiled by the server:<br /><br /><table class="bbc_table"><tr><td><strong>Month</strong></td><td><strong>| Unique visitors</strong></td><td><strong>| Number of visits</strong></td><td><strong>| Hits</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Mar 2006</td><td>806</td><td>3247</td><td>231601</td></tr><tr><td>Apr 2006</td><td>1507</td><td>8356</td><td>672805</td></tr><tr><td>May 2006</td><td>1630</td><td>9079</td><td>718326</td></tr><tr><td>Jun 2006</td><td>2761</td><td>12486</td><td>1012370</td></tr><tr><td>Jul 2006</td><td>4626</td><td>16619</td><td>1671777</td></tr><tr><td>Aug 2006</td><td>5412</td><td>19659</td><td>2439533</td></tr></table>

				At this point there&#39;s no plan for a donation meter, though I&#39;ve (and the mods too) have done quite a bit of thinking and talking about it. I&#39;m a bit resistant to that kind of thing for this site for two primary reasons:<br /><br />1. Every site that I&#39;ve been a part of that does that falls short every single month of the fundraising &quot;goal&quot;. I don&#39;t want astorians.com to be in perpetual fundraising mode trying to reach a goal. It&#39;s depressing to see that the board administrator is having to foot the bill month after month, when this happens I&#39;d rather it not be public (as has been the case for this board for the last 2 years.) I&#39;m not looking for people to feel sorry for me, or for people to be motivated to support this idea out of guilt or because we&#39;re running short (see number 2). :)<br /><br />2. Because I don&#39;t think of Astorians as a charity. It&#39;s a project I started, and then was assisted (sometimes in very significant ways) by people I&#39;ve met along the way. I do it primarily because I love astoria and because when I first launched the site there really wasn&#39;t a board out there that I wanted to join. That being said however, if I was able to do Astorians (or other community building boards) for a living I&#39;d absolutely do it. I&#39;m totally into online community building. So if we ever grow to the point where we could support a full or part-time person (like me, or someone else) I don&#39;t want to set a precedence that the people that run this board must do it for free, or that they&#39;d be working for a charity, or that the only costs to be considered are the hosting costs.<br /><br />Which brings us back to number 1 really; that the &quot;real&quot; cost to operate this site is a lot more than $600/year because it involves the labor of professional people who give a significant portion of their time to keep things running and make things better. If we were to be honest and transparent about that, there&#39;s no chance at all that we could meet the &quot;real&quot; expenses that running such a board entails.<br /><br />So at this point I just prefer to focus on transparency about how the funds will be used (see original post), but not focus on whether or not we are meeting any goal. If we meet expenses great, if we don&#39;t that&#39;s ok too. If we&#39;re over, then I don&#39;t consider that a waste.

				I just thought of one other way to support the site: <strong>link to us!</strong><br /><br />Whenever you are blogging or talking about something that is also being discussed on astorians, just include a link back to that astorians discussion. Another way to link to the site is to just add astorians to your blog roll (the links list on your blog). This helps us get better page rank in the search engines and thus brings in more people that are looking for Astoria/LIC related stuff. It&#39;s a great way to help get the word out there about Astorians.

				Just added some more products to the astorians.com section of the online store - more &quot;Very Hot&quot; items as well as a simple &quot;Astorians.com&quot; design that uses the main font in the Astorians 3.0 design. Thanks to everybody who has supported us thus far. :)<br /><br />Also - just thought I&#39;d add that the shipping is similar (although still a little bit higher) to Cafepress&#39; shipping. Unfortunately that is something that is out of my hands. I believe that Printfection is currently offering $5 off of $20 or more purchases. Just use the coupon code GRANDOPENING5 at check-out. Not sure how long that promotion will last, but when I find out about new coupons I&#39;ll post them here.

				Cool stuff.&nbsp; It would be neat if the stores were integrated.&nbsp; I&#39;d love to buy some flooz buttons AND support astorians.com at the same time (flooz willing).&nbsp; It would also be *sweet* to figure out a way for members to submit a design and &quot;sign it&quot; with their astorians ID.<br /><br />Like I could make a shirt that said:<br /><br />&quot;I&#39;ll bring the beer&quot;<br />astorians.com -jayme<br /><br />Not sure how it would work but a centralized store would be swell for me who would like to buy a little bit of everything and doesn&#39;t want to pay a little bit of a lot of shipping on everything.<br /><br />thanks,<br />jayme<br /><br />

				That&#39;s a great idea Jayme. I think we&#39;d all have to use the same service if I&#39;m not mistaken though.<br /><br />We could create an astorians page that lists all the various links to stores too. Also, maybe we should start a thread for those who want to combine shipping on items purchased from a particular store. The shipping is expensive for just one item, but with multiple items it&#39;s pretty cheap.<br /><br />I&#39;m not sure how we&#39;d implement this, but I think it&#39;s a cool idea.
