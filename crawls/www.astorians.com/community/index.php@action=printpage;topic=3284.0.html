				There has been some interest in putting together another CSA for next year -- with a pick up/distribution more convenient to folks in central/southern Astoria.<br /><br />I&#39;m calling for an informal organizational/brainstorming meeting on this potential new CSA development.<br /><br />Details:&nbsp; Monday 9/11<br />Time: 8:30-9:30<br />Place: Cafe Bar (http://newyork.citysearch.com/profile/7329096/)<br /><br />You do NOT need to be a current CSA member to attend.&nbsp; Meeting is open to anyone and discussion will revolve around the &quot;how to&quot; of setting up a new CSA.&nbsp; <br /><br />thanks,<br />Jayme<br /><br />

				Ooh - me...<br /><br />Seems like step one might be contacting old members of the Queens CSA group?&nbsp; (http://www.queenscsa.org/).&nbsp; I don&#39;t know if they moved over to the Hellgate CSA this year or not.<br /><br />Anybody around here involved with Queens CSA?

				Queens CSA didn&#39;t make it&#39;s membership numbers for last year and it&#39;s members were encouraged to join Hellgate CSA.<br /><br />I think what we&#39;re talking about here would be a *new* CSA for Central/Southern Astoria -- with a smaller, single family sized share -- but definitely Queens CSA will be on the discussion list.<br /><br />thanks,<br />jayme<br />

				I will be there. I&#39;m very interested in a convenient CSA for our neighborhood. I also called the number on the queens csa web site and left a message, saying: If you have a list, please alert the people on your list to the new organization, etc. as well as the details of the meeting. That CSA seemed to just vanish--the site is NOT helpful, there is no mention on the site or the answering machine that it&#39;s not running. It&#39;s like a ghost town. <br /><br />Also, why not put this meeting on the calendar? Or is that only for Freeze Peach events? <br /><br />

				This is just the FIRST informal meeting -- so I think talking to a smaller group is fine.&nbsp; Could post on the calendar but again, looking for a slightly non-huge group.&nbsp; I&#39;d rather present the idea to folks as a more finished concept.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also Queens CSA <em>may</em> be around next year so no need yet to start recruiting members away.&nbsp; <br /><br />This is a new, separate, *different* CSA (smaller share, different organization) than Queens CSA -- adding to the &quot;more the merrier&quot; sort of CSA mentality.<br /><br />thanks,<br />jayme<br />

				Good meeting, there were a solid 5 of us to begin with, then it expanded to 7. But very enthusiastic, none the less.<br /><br />We just need to start looking around for a distribution place for now. The ARROW Comm. Center is one place to start, since they&#39;ve had it there for years previously. If they&#39;re not into it, we&#39;ll have to find some other place where a truck can be parked, either in a loading/unloading zone, or in a driveway, where the place doesn&#39;t mind some dirt, and where we can store 2-3 tables and some crates. There are plenty of parking lots, but if it&#39;s raining on the day of distro., it might not be the best place. Something with a roof would be perfect. Broadway and 36th Ave. train stops are ideal, and anywhere in between.<br /><br />I&#39;m very excited! We need at least 35 people to start it, and it seems there&#39;s plenty of interest, so we shouldn&#39;t have a problem getting that many or more.

				Hey, for anyone that wasn&#39;t able to make it last night, here&#39;s a summary of our meeting:<br /><br />1) Farmer Update:<br />Paula from Just Food updated us that the farmer serving the Hell Gate CSA is overextended and therefore declined adding us for delivery. She therefore contacted other farmer and the Golden Earthworm Farm was the farm that she found for us. Per Paula, the farm is certified organic. Also, working with another farm, whether that&#39;s Golden Earthworm or another Farm, means reverting back to a larger share (the traditional size share of most CSA&#39;s). The smaller size share of the Hell Gate CSA was designed orginally to meet the needs of lower income families but it ended up serving everybody. Also, the CSA grew significantly in size this year from last, from approx 40 people to 90 people this year.<br />Back to the larger share, it means a higher price per person, I think she said $475 for membership, but also larger and more varied share each week. <br />We should get more information about the share delivered at the Forest Hills CSA (who also get their shares from Golden Earthworm).<br /><br />(2) Organizing and running a CSA:<br />We had a discussion with the Hellgate CSA about how they have run and organized their CSA. They indicated to us that at first they followed the suggested organization model presented by Just Foods but that roles were adjusted once the CSA was up and running. They also suggested that we should first focus on getting a core group together to run the CSA and build from there. Once we have a core group in place - we are currently three&nbsp; - we can then concentrate on establishing a location and by February, begin signing people on. Since the number of people that get the Hellgate CSA newsletter is larger than the actual number of members, they don&#39;t think we&#39;ll have trouble getting people to sign up for getting shares. The interest is clearly there. <br /><br />Next Steps:<br />Expanding our Core group to plan and organize the CSA<br />Location, Location, Location (we need to secure a location for share delivery/pick-up)<br /><br />Next Meeting: TBA<br /><br />In the meantime, to get involved, please please please add yourself to our e-list (info posted above by Jayme)<br /><br />peace out,<br />Miri

				is there anyway we can pursue getting a price closer to what Hellsgate is charging?&nbsp; it might be a factor in getting a few of those currently picking up at Freezepeach that live in Southern Astoria/LIC.&nbsp; the hellsgate portion size was perfect for us -- family of 2 adults and 1 kid.&nbsp; A 200 buck differential might make me still make the inconvenient trek to Ditmars.&nbsp; just a thought.&nbsp;

				I&#39;m not really the best person to respond, but if I understand correctly I think that price depends upon the farmer(s) and the size of their shares that are offered to your CSA. Since the new CSA would have a different farmer then they will have their own rates that are separate from Hellgate CSA&#39;s farmer. I&#39;d suggest getting in direct contact with the people who are forming the new CSA to voice your concerns (and I am not sure if they are participants of this thread - maybe contacting Jayme at this point would be your best bet). Who knows - you may be able to work something out or get them to bring their price down!

				Wasabisam&#39;s post is correct.<br /><br />The price of the share is determined by the farm/farmer.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Broadway area CSA is still in the formation stages though -- so share prices have not yet been set.&nbsp; It&#39;s a great time to get involved!<br /><br />If you&#39;re interested in hearing about how it&#39;s going -- or coming to a meeting -- information on joining the mailing list is posted in the thread above.<br /><br />thanks,<br />jayme<br />

				To bring the price in line with Hellgate&#39;s, members can simply sign up with a friend and split the share.&nbsp; Even if you don&#39;t have someone that you know to split with, the fact that everyone picks up on the same day in the same place makes sharing pretty easy.&nbsp; There&#39;s got to be lots of single people around who don&#39;t want to buy in for a full share. <br /><br />

				I should note that Hellgate&#39;s price is smaller but the share is also a smaller size.&nbsp; The more traditional CSA -- in the $400-$500/season range -- is a larger share.<br /><br />-j

				The new CSA in mid-southern Astoria (name still to be decided, help us on a name in another thread) has a share size about twice hte size as the Hellgate CSA (hence, twice the price). We wil have a mixer/ Q&amp;A with opportunity for people to pair up and find share buddies as we know this wil be a concern of many. Don&#039;t be afraid to upgrade!
