				Hi, all,<br /><br />I&#039;m going to be moving to Astoria this summer, and ideally I want to make sure that my apartment is convenient to a yoga studio.&nbsp; Does anyone have any recommendations?&nbsp; I&#039;ve been to the Yoga Room and liked it, but I&#039;m wondering if there are any other alternatives out there in case I can&#039;t find a place near there.&nbsp; I got very spoiled living 2 blocks from a wonderful studio in Philly.<br /><br />I did a search, and it seems like people are keen on the Yoga Room and not keen on Dahn (I don&#039;t know anything about them).&nbsp; What are your thoughts?<br /><br />Thanks a lot!

				I don&#039;t have any personal experience with Dahn Yoga but I know a few people who tried their classes and the reviews were sub-par.&nbsp; <br /><br />I love the Yoga Room&nbsp; :smitten:&nbsp; They have a fairly central location in Astoria, I don&#039;t think it will be too difficult to find an apartment within walking distance.

				Thanks!&nbsp; I love the emoticon -- that pretty much sums up how I felt about the Yoga Room, too, when I tried it.&nbsp; I&#039;m just nervous about the apartment hunt, ugh, and wanting to keep my options as open as possible in terms of location.

				I&#039;ve never tried the Dahn Yoga place in Astoria, but I have done it elsewhere, and it&#039;s bizarre. The poses aren&#039;t technically hatha, and about half the class I attended was spent in meditation, during which the teacher went around and did some kind of weird energy manipulation, if that&#039;s what it was. So it&#039;s just The Yoga Room!<br />

				You may also want to stop by Sai Organics on 30th Avenue as I believe they may be offering some classes.

				I joined Dahn Yoga briefly, on 23rd Ave. It is very strange. They are more into spirtuality and chakras. If that is what you are into or looking for, that is probably a good place. But, if you are just looking for Yoga as a form of exercise without the spirituality, I would skip it. <br /><br />I usually felt pretty loose after classes, but I won&#039;t lie, it was difficult not to laugh sometimes... and that made me feel bad. It just wasn&#039;t my cup of tea is all. <br /><br />I&#039;ll have to check out this Yoga room though... where is it?
