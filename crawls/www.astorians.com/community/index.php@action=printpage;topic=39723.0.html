				yup, we totally need it and i am thrilled for it.&nbsp; The more people riding bikes for transportation the better.&nbsp; We can learn from the European cities that have adopted this mode of transportation in urban areas a long time ago.&nbsp; It works.&nbsp; I see no negatives whatsoever.&nbsp; It makes the streets more pedestrian friendly, not less.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Fewer cars on the road and more bikes is a good thing.&nbsp; The people that get all pissy about this are typically sedentary loafs who drive 5 blocks by themselves to go to a fast food joint. Exercise is a good thing.&nbsp; get those cars off of the city streets<br /><br /><br />Things change, neighborhoods change.&nbsp; deal with it.&nbsp; Nobody wants racist xenophobes in the area anyway.&nbsp; I don&#039;t care how long you have lived here.&nbsp;

More bikers also means the potential of less cars on the road. Same thing, more safety for pedestrians.<br /><br />Also, I find that New Yorkers are equal opportunity traffic offenders. Pedestrians, bikers and drivers are in general equally bad in my opinion. Pedestrians cross in the middle of the street, when the &quot;don&#039;t walk&quot; sign is lit, walk between cars etc. The difference is that in terms of actual damage to people the heavier and faster the vehicle the bigger the risk. Bikes constitute less risk than heavy motor vehicles.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=39723.msg256861.html#msg256861">Quote from: astoristani on April 25, 2017, 11:08:56 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> Double parking, </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Fewer cars = less double parking.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=39723.msg256861.html#msg256861">Quote from: astoristani on April 25, 2017, 11:08:56 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">the typical third world driver that refuses to obey the traffic laws make Astoria such a traffic mess.<br />How can anyone advocate this with a right mind?<br />Oh, I forget...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I forgot for a second your xenophobic attitude. Yes, you make exceptions for &quot;your&quot; peeps. Seems &quot;they&quot; are &quot;third world&quot; people though.<br /><br />As for the actual point of not obeying laws: Again, the potential damage by a car not obeying laws is far higher than that of a biker not obeying laws. Additionally, this is really an issue of law enforcement. If you feel strongly about this then lobby your politicians to get cops to crack down on traffic violations.<br /><br />PS: I think it&#039;s probably more your xenophobic attitude that keeps people away from this site.

				<br />Thoughts...<br /><br />I think allowing the option for Citibike in Astoria is good.&nbsp; However the location of the stations clearly needs to be given a lot of thought, and imho, no one in their right mind should be wanting or considering riding a bicycle, on places like Bway, 30th Ave., Steinway, 31st Street, and the like.&nbsp; Those streets are already utter chaos, and narrow, and that&#039;s WITHOUT the double-parking that occurs on Steinway, or the slimeballs on 31st Street, who try to sneak over to the parking lane in order to make a &#039;quick right turn&#039;.<br /><br />I&#039;d relish the opportunity to occasionally ride a bike around the park, or across some of the lesser-travelled avenues (i.e., 20th Ave.).&nbsp; I don&#039;t have space for owning my own bike and am worried about theft, and most folding bikes seem too heavy/cumbersome for me.&nbsp; So Citibike or a similar rent-by-the-hour option is the only thing that would work for me.<br /><br />As for the suggestion that maybe with Citibike, current car-owners might then consider giving up one of the family cars, or NOT buying a 2nd or 3rd car for the family, to me that&#039;s apples and oranges.&nbsp; Those who would use Citibike are generally not car people, and vice versa...those who own cars generally aren&#039;t interested in bicycling throughout the nabe.<br /><br />Net, net, what this all boils down to imho is the Old Astoria vs the New Astoria....the long-term residents (generally more &#039;blue collar&#039; and who own cars) vs the new residents (generally relatively well-off - considering their ages - young people, &#039;hipsters&#039; if you will... and less likely to own a car and who are more into saving the environment...).&nbsp; We can argue between ourselves all we want but it won&#039;t get us anywhere.&nbsp; We have to come to some type of a compromise.&nbsp; <br /><br />So for starters, maybe we don&#039;t criticize people for simply owning a car, but perhaps we can instead address some of the bad behaviors of &#039;some&#039; car-owners.&nbsp; At the top of that list (imho) would be the aforementioned double-parking on Steinway (which btw our illustrious DoT is also largely to blame, for seemingly allowing it to run rampant, and drivers being utterly nonchalant about sitting even in MTA bus stops??!)... and also the dangerous mode of driving under the el on 31st Street, and then suddenly pulling into the right lane to sneak a right turn...that too must stop.<br /><br />As for those who want Astoria to be more bike-friendly, well perhaps they can start by acknowledging that for the most part, they are relatively new to this neighborhood...that the neighborhood isn&#039;t going to change for them overnight, and that they cannot expect that main thoroughfares are going to have bike lanes added, and that they just may have to use less congested/trafficked streets....&nbsp; (Vernon Blvd. also seems to make sense to me.... also 14th Street....&nbsp; and&nbsp; PERHAPS 21st Street due to how wide it is... but 21st would really have to be looked at seriously due to the fact is has 2 lanes of traffic in each direction, plus MTA buses...)

				<br />Below is my personal use case for biking which I believe is practical for most people in good health:<span style="font-family: Verdana;" class="bbc_font">[size=78%] [/size]</span><br /><br /><br />If the trip is less than a mile or so one way I&#039;ll walk.&nbsp; If less than 5-7 miles one way I&#039;ll ride my bike.&nbsp; If rainy, snowy or icy weather or more than 5-7 miles, or if I need to carry large items I&#039;ll take the subway or drive a car.<br />Once you have a family or if you like to reach beyond city limits you probably need a car (to make trips to other family members outside of town or just trips to fun destinations where mass transit isn&#039;t available).<br /><br /><br />For some people, weekly, weekend or even hourly car rentals work.&nbsp; For others car ownership is more practical.<br /><br /><br />I personally believe that you do need access to a car to maintain a good lifestyle in this city.&nbsp; If you own the car just keep it in a garage and think twice before using it!<br /><br /><br />I can&#039;t wait for lots of well placed Citibike stations throughout the city.&nbsp; Even though there are quite a few bike riders today, adding more bike riders via Citibike will get car drivers more used to seeing bikes and increase awareness and safety for all.<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve maintained a great lifestyle in this city, am a native New Yorker and a lifelong Astorian, and I do not own a car and don&#039;t even drive. <br /><br /><br />I walk wherever I can or take mass transit for longer distances such as commuting to work and have never regretted not having a car or not learning to drive. <br /><br /><br />I&#039;m not a bike fan but have nothing against the Citibike plan coming here. It&#039;s a great option for people like me who would use the bikes. <br /><br /><br />My problem is with cyclists who think the basic rules of the road don&#039;t apply to them. Cyclists are supposed to stop at red lights and stop signs, yield to pedestrians, etc. and most don&#039;t. Many behave worse than drivers do, both in Astoria and the rest of the city.<br /><br /><br />Cyclists need to realize they&#039;re operating a moving vehicle and should obey the rules the same as if they were driving a car. For me, there&#039;s no negotiating this. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				<br />I too have never owned a car and hopefully never will.&nbsp; Not only do I see no need for it in a place like NYC (subway, walk, bike, taxi, Uber, Avis, Zipcar, FreshDirect, man-with-a-van, etc.) but...I have no interest in spending all that money and thinking about parking, shoveling, etc.&nbsp; A car is just one more &#039;thing&#039; in my life to worry about, and I prefer to live as simply as possible.<br /><br />As for cyclists who don&#039;t obey the rules of the road, I find that most people are good, and that the worst offenders are bike messengers, tourists on Citibike, and food delivery guys on those &#039;silent but deadly&#039; scooters, who, when they come to a red light, make a quick little &#039;dip&#039; into the adjoining side street, now think they have a &#039;green light&#039;, and make another quick &#039;dip&#039; onto the road where they were originally driving.<br /><br />One time I was on the sidewalk in the winter and had my hood up (so no peripheral vision).&nbsp; A food delivery guy on a bike whipped past me on the sidewalk.&nbsp; Naturally, I was shocked as I never saw/heard him coming (and often when this happens, by the time you regain your composure, the guy is so far from you that you can&#039;t yell at him!)&nbsp; What if just then I had decided to walk slightly left or right?&nbsp; He would have plowed right into me.&nbsp; So.... as I continued walking, I observed the cyclist stop to deliver food about six houses ahead.&nbsp; When I finally came to that house, I called out to the delivery guy, and told him what had just happened...that I was wearing a hood...never saw/heard him...that he really startled me etc.&nbsp; I said that a simple &#039;bell&#039; for his bike, or his calling out &#039;on your left&#039;, would have been nice.&nbsp; He did apologize.&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp; I figured if I said nothing, he might never know how startling it can be to people, especially when they are coming up from behind you!<br /><br />

				The food delivery guys with their motorized scooters that go from 0-20mph in a heartbeat are a real menace, have no respect for pedestrians or other users of the roads (and sometimes sidewalks).&nbsp; Not sure why we can&#039;t get these commercial users licensed and insured.<br /><br /><br />Regarding the comment about bike riders not stopping for red lights or follow the rules of the road, I think most bike riding commuters think of ourselves as pedestrians rather than motorists. As a life long NYC resident I&#039;ll say that the majority of NY pedestrians don&#039;t stop for red lights if they safely can cross and even happily walk out into the street from between parked cars/trucks so they don&#039;t have to get to the corner.&nbsp; Pedestrians glued to their cell phones just makes matters worse.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />You don&#039;t have to worry about bike riders speeding through red lights or stop signs since any bike rider that doesn&#039;t slow down to a crawl when approaching a red light/stop sign to check for crossing pedestrians or vehicles isn&#039;t going to be alive for very long.

				I&#039;m OK with anything that improves our transportation infrastructure (although I consider bikes as more of recreational vehicle).&nbsp; <br /><br />CitiBike would be great for Astoria and at least the bike lanes would be put to good use.&nbsp; <br /><br />As a driver and public transportation rider myself, there are pros and cons to both:<br />Cons: Cars are an expense, they need a place to park, they need maintenance and insurance<br />Pros: Transportation you can use anytime you want, leaving town, loading stuff etc (I don&#039;t want to rely on car rental/sharing services)<br />Cons: Public transportation is unreliable especially in Queens, constant repair work on weekends.<br />Pros: useful for getting into Manhattan (or as some of you call it, &quot;the city&quot;) during work hours.&nbsp; Cheap (compared to other transportation).<br /><br />BTW I was born/raised in Astoria and adapted to my environment.&nbsp; I don&#039;t get angry over bicycles as I do ride them (recreationally) myself.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				They now have it on Steinway between 25 and 28 near the Coldstone.&nbsp; A block that already has considerable double parking (in general and from the Dominos pizza).<br /><br />While walking past the location, this morning I saw that a car owner had apparently doored a passing cyclist going the right way down the street.&nbsp; There needs to a lot more care and consideration on many sides it seems to me.<br /><br />I tell people that &quot;Astoria&quot; is Greek for &quot;double parked cars&quot;.&nbsp; They believe me.

				They&#039;re also on 31st Avenue from 30th to 31st Street and on Newtown Avenue by 23rd Street in front of the school there (the old Mount Carmel grammar school).<br /><br /><br />Thisis a little too much. I don&#039;t see the need for so many Citibikes. All I can think now is that I&#039;ll have to look both ways before even crossing one-way streets since the majority of cyclists never obey traffic rules. They run through red lights, don&#039;t stop at stop signs, don&#039;t signal when turning - nothing.

				<br />I literally just purchased my first (used) bicycle as an adult.&nbsp; (The last time I had a bike was as a young teen!) I&#039;m super excited with my cute little bike, and after literally just 4 rides of just about 20 minutes each, I&#039;ve already learned and figured out a LOT, just by being aware and using common sense.<br /><br />1) I completely avoid streets such as Steinway, Bway, 30th Ave, 23rd Ave. (at least, definitely the more narrow &#039;park end&#039; of 23rd Ave.), 21st St., 31st St, Ditmars.<br /><br />2) The first time I was going to ride from Point A to Point B - to bring my used bike to a bike shop for them to check it and give it a clean bill of health, I first looked at Google Maps to figure out what streets I should take, and the direction of the traffic.&nbsp; I figured it&#039;s best to know the route and memorize it, before I hop on a bike.<br /><br />3) I only ride WITH the traffic and I behave just like a car, stopping at all red lights.<br /><br />4) When riding down a one-way street, I stay on the RIGHT side of the road.&nbsp; I figured out (all on my own, and thought I was pretty &#039;smart&#039; to do so ;-) ...that ..... if I stay on the left side of the street I&#039;ll be riding alongside Passenger side doors.&nbsp; If I stay on the right side of the street, I am riding alongside Driver side doors.&nbsp; &nbsp;So then I thought &#039;hmmm...I&#039;m thinking that Drivers, who always look out into the street before pulling out...I&#039;m thinking that even after they&#039;ve parked the car, that they are more in the habit of still looking out into the road, BEFORE opening their door.&nbsp; Whereas a passenger is somewhat LESS likely to be in that habit, and especially if they themselves don&#039;t drive.&nbsp; So I decided it&#039;s much safer for me to ride closer to the driver&#039;s side door of parked cars.<br /><br />5) As I ride up streets, I ring my little bell every few seconds.&nbsp; I figure better safe than sorry, and that I should always make it clear to people that I&#039;m there.&nbsp; You never know...there could be a pedestrian I can&#039;t see that&#039;s about to step out between two parked cars.&nbsp; There could be a driver inside a car, and I can&#039;t see him, and he&#039;s just parked and is now about to open his door.&nbsp; There could be a car that&#039;s parked, and they&#039;ve started their engine, and they think it&#039;s ok to start inching out just as I&#039;m&nbsp; approaching their car.&nbsp; So yeah, I&#039;ll be the irritating lady in the nabe constantly ringing her little bicycle bell.&nbsp; ;-)<br /><br />6) During heavier traffic hours, if I find myself up near the front of a line of cars waiting for the light to change, I will often just pull over to the side a bit, turn around and watch for all the cars to pass, and then I will pull back out and continue on my way.&nbsp; I am being extremely cautious riding on the streets, because I know that even something as simple as a little pebble under my tire the wrong way, could send me flying.&nbsp; So I don&#039;t want to add to that mix, any additional stress with cars and traffic.&nbsp; I&#039;d rather wait a few seconds, let all the cars pass, and then feel safer proceeding, and without a whole line of cars behind or alongside me.&nbsp; And I have to say...thus far I&#039;ve noticed that in such instances, the cars have seemed to defer to me...almost like they are holding back waiting for me to go ahead and pull back out into the lane of traffic.&nbsp; But I just motion to them that it&#039;s ok for them to just go ahead and pass...and that I plan to wait until the road is more clear.&nbsp; So thank you to all you considerate drivers!<br /><br />And now for a question for the &#039;bike people&#039;, esp those who keep their bikes locked up on the street.&nbsp; My plan is to keep my bike on the street overnight since I live in a very small 3rd floor walkup.&nbsp; I currently keep it locked up (using 3 different locks overnight!) onto one of those circular bike racks that has a horizontal bar.&nbsp; It&#039;s near a bodega which also means constant foot traffic and eyes. If it gets stolen it gets stolen.&nbsp; I realize I am taking a chance, but it&#039;s a calculated risk.&nbsp; I also plan to &#039;rotate&#039; the corner where I park my bike, switching it between bodega corners (as someone had told me that if the same one bike is seen locked up in the same spot night after night, potential thieves may eventually assume no one &#039;cares&#039; about the bike, or that it doesn&#039;t have a vigilant owner, that it&#039;s &#039;abandoned&#039; etc.&nbsp; So they said it&#039;s best to move the bike often...make it look like it has an &#039;active&#039; owner)<br /><br />Anyway..... I want to buy a bike cover for inclement weather (rain).&nbsp; During the dead of winter, that&#039;s the only time I will hoist my bike up onto my 3rd floor balcony and keep it there.&nbsp; What I&#039;m trying to figure out is....if I get a bike cover, and my bike has two chains plus the U-lock, all connect to the horizontal bar of the bike rack....once I try to put the cover over my bike, I guess the cover can only go down as far as the horizontal bar...cuz then the chain locks will be in the way.&nbsp; So the cover won&#039;t be able to go down to the very bottom of the bike.&nbsp; Will that cause a problem...is rain very problematic say for the wheel spokes?&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks!
