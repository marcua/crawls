				I&#039;m the resident hermit here in my little hole in the boonies of Astoria.&nbsp; How is it out there?&nbsp; How are the roads?&nbsp; Subways?&nbsp; Are there downed trees?<br /><br />I spoke with my folks upstate and they are in states of emergency.&nbsp; Downed trees, no heat, no electricity, over 2 feet.&nbsp; It&#039;s bad, and I wish I could go and help.<br /><br />I&#039;m so wishing for spring.&nbsp; I work from home, and I really become such a hermit every winter.&nbsp; This has been a brutal one too.&nbsp; I just want flowers, and 80 degree days, and to wear next to nothing outside instead of millions of layers.&nbsp; Anyone else missing spring?

				I&#039;m totally missing Spring and Summer.&nbsp; I&#039;m looking at summer equipment online to ease the pain.&nbsp; I found the PERFECT beach chair on Amazon.&nbsp; It&#039;s $40 -- is that reasonable for a beach chair?&nbsp; It&#039;s my first one.&nbsp; It doubles as a backpack and has a little adjustable pillow.&nbsp; <br /><br />My trip in to the city was uneventful.&nbsp; The subways were running... seemingly totally normally (three adverbs together at last!).&nbsp; I hate to say it.&nbsp; I love complaining about the MTA as much as the next guy but the trains don&#039;t seem majorly affected.&nbsp; Or did I just get lucky?&nbsp; <br /><br />

				Leaving for work at 6:30AM this morning meant I was the first person leaving my building so there wasn&#039;t yet any tamped down snow.&nbsp; I had to trudge through what looked like 10-12 inches of snow to make it to the sidewalk.&nbsp; Even then, there was barely a path through it all, so I just walked on the street.&nbsp; Walked on the street the whole way to the Ditmars station.&nbsp; Train was running no problem.<br /><br />It kind of caught me by surprise how much snow fell.

				I just commuted to work, found out they closed (they made the announcement at 8am, thanks guys, everyone was already on their way), and I just got home a little while ago!<br /><br />Trains were running fine in both directions (I take the N). The sidewalks on Ditmars (from 31 - Steinway) are mostly shoveled/salted/being worked on, and the couple that haven&#039;t been done are all packed down. A little annoying, but not terrible if it&#039;s just you walking. If you have a cart or a stroller, it would probably suck. The sidewalks on Steinway are mostly unshoveled, but a path has been packed down by walkers. It&#039;s annoying, but bearable. It seems like people are starting to come outside to work on them.<br /><br />For drivers: The side roads don&#039;t look plowed at all yet (they&#039;re probably working their way through). Ditmars and Steinway are driveable, but they have packed down snow on them. The GCP/Triboro just looked wet and people seemed to be traveling at normal speeds. The area around Queensboro Plaza looked slushy and wet, but people seemed to be driving fine.<br /><br />(Haha, I just realized I sound like a traffic/weather reporter. This is Alison, with your Ditmars area rail &amp; road report! Move over Debbie Duhaime!)

				Thanks for the reports, guys!&nbsp; I&#039;m glad to hear the subways are ok.&nbsp; &nbsp;That sucks, Alison, that you went all the way out there.&nbsp; That&#039;s a long trip.&nbsp; <br /><br />I haven&#039;t even been outside since Wednesday.&nbsp; I feel like a super hermit.&nbsp; I really need to get a cat or something......&nbsp; It&#039;s lonely up in here!<br /><br />I guess I&#039;ll go blast some music and get to work.

				&quot;Annoying but bearable&quot; describes how it was shoveling over a foot of snow off a few dozen feet of sidewalk for the past three hours -- and it&#039;s still snowing.&nbsp; Unless you live on a major street, this is pretty rough stuff.&nbsp; Watched a Coors delivery truck not make it up my hill at about 8:30.&nbsp; And two foolish people try to get out in non-four wheel drive vehicles, only to give it up after 10 minutes of wheel spinning.&nbsp; Annoyed by walking conditions?&nbsp; Grab a shovel and make some money with your time off.&nbsp; For all the pissing and moaning I did in the past three hours, I enjoyed the beauty of winter as much as anyone when I took a few minutes to catch my breath and enjoy the silence.&nbsp; Got a great workout to boot.

				Went to shovel out my car, then thought, &quot;WTF am I doing? The trains are fine.&quot; Put away the shovel and packed up the snowshoes, brought them to work. My commute took 1hr compared to the usual 10min by car, but I didn&#039;t have any good excuses NOT to come to work. <br /><br />As I passed by the guys shoveling around the building, thanked them. They&#039;re hardcore. At least I&#039;m inside.

				I left my house about 8 and it looked like 21st Avenue had yet to be plowed.&nbsp; I just walked all the way to the train in the middle of the roads (pausing for passing cars, of course!).<br /><br />The N train was fine but the 7 was having all kinds of signal issues and sending random trains back to Flushing from Queensboro rather than continuing to Manhattan.&nbsp; People were patient though so it wasn&#039;t too brutal.<br /><br />All told my normal 25-30 minute commute took about an hour.

				So someone was shoveling the sidewalk at 4:15 am this morning. I&#039;m all about being proactive, but let us sleep! It wasn&#039;t even a quick, efficient shoveling. It was a slow....chunk/ scrape/ push. Then a snowblower started up and it was done within 5 minutes so I could get back to sleep.

				Ok I&#039;m back.&nbsp; Wow what a winter wonderland out there.&nbsp; I have to admit it&#039;s pretty.&nbsp; But I don&#039;t envy anyone having to shovel out this morning.&nbsp; The cars are all plowed in, and the streets are still full of snow.&nbsp; But a guy shoveling said it was light snow so it didn&#039;t bother him.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s quiet and nice.&nbsp; But I wish I could say the same for those upstate who have no power right now.&nbsp; I suppose it is quiet there too.&nbsp; But not so nice...<br /><br />My neighbor usually shovels all night too.&nbsp; But it looks like neither my house or the neighbors shoveled their driveways this morning.&nbsp; Maybe they are both at work right now.

				I guess there&#039;s a sweet spot for shoveling.&nbsp; If you do it too soon, you&#039;ll just have to do it again when the snow stops.&nbsp; But if you do it too late, it will be packed and hard to lift.&nbsp; One of the many reasons I love apartment living.&nbsp; &nbsp; 8-)

				Thats some fluffy snow. What a surprise.<br /><br /><br />To the little shop that had impeccable shoveling. WOW. Good on you.<br />&nbsp;:mrgreen:<br /><br /><br /><br />For me, the first day of snow is one day too many. And unless we hit 120F ++, I wont complain.<br />Please be spring soon.<br /><br />&nbsp;8-)

				I love how these big snowfalls make things quiet out there.&nbsp; It slows down the cars, too, which I think is great.&nbsp; Since I don&#039;t have to shovel my sidewalk, dig out my car, drive anywhere, and have appropriate protective coverings, I really enjoyed my walk to the train (5 minutes, no big deal).&nbsp; This snowfall reminds me of the snowfalls during my Michigan childhood, so it&#039;s bringing back some happy memories.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am, however, dreading the ice that will no doubt form and make things much more dangerous out there.&nbsp; Stay safe everyone!

				Be careful near roofs, everyone.&nbsp; The snow has been crashing down from my roof and balcony all day.&nbsp; It comes down like an avalanche.&nbsp; Huge icicles too.&nbsp; It always scares me thinking it might fall on someone.

				So I decided to walk to my appointment up on Ditmars, from Broadway to check out the sights.&nbsp; My route there was along Steinway and I took 31st back.&nbsp; I made a few observations...<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Ladies - there are boots and then there are WINTER boots.&nbsp; Today is the day you wear the winter ones. How do you know?&nbsp; Well, crossing the street and trying to get across the huge puddle of slush will confirm if you&#039;ve got the right pair on.&nbsp; FYI I&#039;m the one laughing behind you when you shriek &quot;my foot got wet&quot;.&nbsp; No *%&amp;! there is a foot of snow out there!<br /><br />2.&nbsp; Rock salt helps - but only AFTER you shovel the snow and just have little bits of icy patches left.&nbsp; I got quite a chuckle out of the Vitamin&#039;s Shop&#039;s attempt at clearing their snow away with a creative approach.&nbsp; <br /><br />3.&nbsp; The snow/ice sliding off the awnings can&#039;t get you if you are under it.&nbsp; Watch out people I had several close calls and I&#039;m sure someone else would have appreciated the show had I gotten pelted.<br /><br />All in all, great walk&nbsp; and yes, most people have gotten their sidewalks cleared so no need to stay inside.&nbsp; Just don&#039;t forget your WINTER boots :)

				If your awnings aren&#039;t well supported, make sure you knock the snow off of them! I saw someone&#039;s house down the street (on 24th Ave.) whose awning collapsed under the weight of the snow.
