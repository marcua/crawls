				In the month of May, BoA card members get free admission to some museums. &nbsp;Kinda cool.<br /><br />List is here:<br />http://64.106.216.172/museums/?adlink=000309029f360000b300<br /><br />And to sound a little less like a BoA advertisement...<br /><br />Washington Mutual is opening up on 31st under the subway.<br />Yipeee!<br /><br />Also Atomic Wings -- which, to my knowledge, is not a banking service.<br /><br />cheers,<br />jayme

				It's opening in the spot where Burger King used to be under the Ditmars stop on 31st, next to that basement Tae Kwon Do place. &nbsp;They're advertising Philly Cheese Steaks, Burgers and Wings on the banner they've got in the window.<br /><br />Jayme - thanks for the list!

				I was really disappointed to see the Washington Mutual storefront on Saturday. &nbsp;Does 31st Street really need ANOTHER bank??<br /><br />How about a bookstore or music store?<br /><br />Grrr. &nbsp; &nbsp; :evil:

				We already have so many banks in one area did we really need another one! No! and it just had to be one of the worst banks at that to open up. Give me commerce any day.<br /><br />I am looking forward to the wings place. The deal has been in the works for a really long time. The owner of the spot's lawyers gave the wings people a really hard time about opening up there but the deal finally went through. I heard they are supposed to serve 20 different styles of wings. I hope they are yummy, hard to find good wings in the city. So far the only place I found that the wings were yummy is Bar 89 on 89 Mercer st. But it is a pain going all the way into the city sometimes.
