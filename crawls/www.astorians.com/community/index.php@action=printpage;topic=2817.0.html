				Hey guys, I was supposed to go to a rock show tonight, but my friends sister (who I was supposed to go with) decided to go into labor this afternoon.<br /><br />The tickets are up on Craigslist, but I thought I&#39;d toss them out into the universe here, too:<br />http://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/tix/188872882.html (http://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/tix/188872882.html)<br /><br />If you want them, it&#39;s probably best to contact me through the Craigslist email link - that comes directly to my inbox.<br /><br />Also, according to Candlebox&#39;s website, Driveblind and On A Dead Machine are performing too (I have no idea who either of thoe two bands are though).<br /><br />Also, please don&#39;t make fun that we were going to a Candlebox show&nbsp; :wink: We were into them in high school and when we saw that they were touring this summer, we kind of regressed. :)

				Haha, I just reread this and it sounds like I was going to go to a show with a 9-month pregnant woman. No...I was going with my friend, and her sister went into labor. Hehe...
