				Does anyone know anything about this particular doctor?&nbsp; His main office is in Jamaica, but he also has an office at the Boro Medical Center on 31st Avenue in Astoria.&nbsp; <br /><br />Dr. Reno Discala MD<br />46-04 31st Avenue<br /><br />And, yes, I checked the 900 or so web sites regarding doctor ratings, but it would be useful to have a fellow astorian&#039;s opinion.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks.

				I highly recommend my doctor, he takes almost all insurance.<br /><br />Ambrose Pipia, M.D. on 30th between 42nd and 43rd.<br /><br />He&#039;s a sweetheart and really takes his time.&nbsp; It was the first time in ages (I think I was a little girl) that a doctor actually drew blood.&nbsp; Now a days most doctors won&#039;t do that because it&#039;s the &quot;nurse&#039;s&quot; job, but Dr. Pipia has no problems.&nbsp; Like he says, &quot;I&#039;m a doctor, I&#039;m here to take care of people and if I&#039;m the only one around to do this and I know why then why am I going to make you come back another day?&nbsp; That&#039;s stupid, no?&quot;<br /><br />I love him, he&#039;s great.

				Dr Discala is awesome.&nbsp; He was my primary care guy for a while at the triboro office, but thanks to insurance changes due to job changes I had to stop going to him, which sucks.&nbsp; I would definitely recommend him.<br /><br />EDIT to add: I always expect a long wait at the doctor&#039;s office, and for a good doctor I feel comfortable with I&#039;ll deal with it (same with dentistry) but yes, I agree with others&#039; complaints about the waits to Triboro.

				I agree that Dr. Discala is nice.&nbsp; And, yes, I do expect to wait for an appointment.&nbsp; However, the first time I went it was a 2 hour wait and the time after that over 3 hours.&nbsp; That, to me, is just too long of a wait.&nbsp; I could not imagine waiting that long if I was gravely ill.

Well I did, but she barely spoke English-she actually had an interpreter in the examining room. She also prescribed me a derivitive of penicillin that would have killed me had I not caught it before going to the pharmacy. I&#039;ve thought about manhattan, but if I&#039;m sick and need a once over I don&#039;t want to blow money on a cab or take the train into manhattan.

				I was just going to start a new thread when I saw this one. Does anyone else have any PCP dr recommendations? I&#039;ll even consider Manhattan, if the dr. is nice, the waits aren&#039;t too long, and most importantly, the office staff is good.

				He&#039;s not in Astoria but Dr. Rajiv V. Kinkhabwala at Murray Hill Medical Group is ta great doctor.&nbsp; You can read about him and the group he belong to at http://www.mhmg.net.&nbsp; Once you have had your initial appointment, you automatically have access to booking appointments etc. on-line.&nbsp; It&#039;s great to be able to see all the available appointments for the next few days when you need to schedule one and time is tight.&nbsp; He also has no problem making referrals (a problem I had here in Astoria with a few doctors before I found his practice).&nbsp; I have recommended Dr. Kinkhabwala to friends, who have all been very happy with him.

				First, thanks to the astorians, again, for advice and recommendations.&nbsp; I appreciate all of the help.&nbsp; This whole process of choosing a PCP is making me sick!<br /><br />Second, I saw Dr. Discala earlier today.&nbsp; The wait to actually get in the examining room wasn&#039;t long at all.&nbsp; Granted, there weren&#039;t very many people there, but I was really quite pleased and surprised about the relatively short amount of time that I had sit in the waiting room.<br /><br />A very nice and engaging student physician assistant saw me first and did the initial exam and questioning, so I was all ready for Dr. Discala when he came in.&nbsp; He was nice and very helpful.&nbsp; The student stayed in the room and it was interesting to hear their &quot;give and take.&quot;&nbsp; He asked her what she thought my diagnosis was and how it should be treated.&nbsp; For some reason, they both agreed that I should quit smoking.&nbsp; They might be on to something there.<br /><br />Anyway, I would recommend Dr. Discala for those who want to stay in the area for a PCP.&nbsp;

As an older woman, allow me to tell you how this process generally goes. Whether you have numbness in your legs, an eye infection, an upper respiratory infection, a swollen and painful finger, an earache, a backache, pain in the groin area, sharp stabbing intermittent pains in the lower right quadrant, constipation, swollen and infected tonsils, acne, hair loss, nail fungus, fibroid tumors, thyroid disturbance, pituitary dysfunction,&nbsp; primary or secondary dysmenorrhea, sleep dysfuction, elevated body temperature, a urinary tract infection, a raging vaginitis, hives . . . or any other medical problem . . . the problem will be blamed on one of the following: your (over)weight, your being either peri- or post-menopausal or your smoking. Doctors need to get used to simply saying, &quot;I don&#039;t know!&quot;

				In 1973 my parents purchased the Discala&#039;s house.&nbsp; Reno&#039;s late father was also a Doctor.&nbsp; They moved somewhere like Douglaston.&nbsp; Anyway, they were so nice to us.&nbsp; The house was left in perfect shape and they left toys for us.<br /><br />I remember getting the daughters room and she had a big peace sign on her closet door.&nbsp; It is there to this day! She probably put it up in the 60&#039;s!
