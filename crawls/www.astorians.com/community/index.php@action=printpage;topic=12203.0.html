				Hello!<br />It seems that children from Upper West Side to Park Slope to Forest Hills are taking foreign-language classes from a very early age (some classes advertise as being appropriate from 0 months!). Yet, in Astoria, one of the most multi-lingual and multi-national neighborhood in the city, I can not find anything ... I am originally from Russia, and I am trying to raise my son to be bi-lingual. I think he would benefit greatly from having playmates who may speak Russian with one or both of their parents.&nbsp; As a way to meet like-minded moms and their children, I am willing to volunteer to start a story-time event in Russian, and I am sure a local library or a church will accommodate such a group, if there is enough interest ... but ... is there enough interest? Please let me know your thoughts. May be we could start something truly great - a language exchange / language lessons for our children.<br /><br />Thanks!

				I hear more and more Russian speakers in Astoria these last few years. Whether they are parents or not is another question... You might want to try posting in grocery stores or just signs on street posts. Have you checked the parenting groups in Astoria for Russian speakers? Take a look at the other threads in here for that info. I don&#039;t have any children but your storytelling hour sounds really great. I thought I&#039;d have to resort to a Russian nanny from Forest Hills to get some bilingual speaking (my husband doesn&#039;t speak Russian.)

				We might be interested.&nbsp; And, there&#039;s another couple up the street from us that might be interested as well.&nbsp; If you are one of the parents then we have met already.
