				There is a now a group on Facebook called &quot;Petition Trader Joe&#039;s to Open a Store in Astoria, Queens.&quot;&nbsp; I&#039;m so glad other people share my strong desire to bring Trader Joe&#039;s to Astoria!

				Sounds more like wishful thinking than a realistic expectation. Trader Joe&#039;s would only conside opening a store in a neighborhood where they can expect a lot of customers. I doubt that Astoria fits that bill. The same goes for bookstores; I never got the impression that Astorians are avid book readers.<br /><br />Now open yet another outdoor fancy coffee hangout place.......and customers will be teeming like flies.

				I go to the one in Union Square since it isn&#039;t worth it to me to take a train and a bus to get to the one in Queens.&nbsp; A few months back, I was chatting with the cashier about how I come all the way from Astoria to that location.&nbsp; She said they were considering Astoria as a potential future location.&nbsp; I am curious how well the one on Woodhaven Blvd does since you need to take a car or bus there.&nbsp; It&#039;s hard to say how well it would do in Astoria but if they open it, I will shop there more often than I already do (and so will my girlfriend and several other friends who live here).

				I&#039;ve nearly always been intimidated by the long line in the Union Square store; the one time I braved it was on a Sunday evening after I&#039;d been to a movie.&nbsp; Fortunately, the line moved quickly.<br /><br />And is Astoria really such a neighborhood of nonreaders?&nbsp; I&#039;ve always assumed that the lack of a B&amp;N here was a matter of real estate.&nbsp; On the N train, when most of the seats are taken, there are always people reading books or electronic devices.<br /><br />I&#039;m a holdout against Facebook, but if I were on it I&#039;d sign that petition.&nbsp; &nbsp;The more Trader Joe stores in New York, the more likely I&#039;d be to get on line.

				We actually do not have a complete lack of bookstores.&nbsp; We have Seaburn Books, which is chock full of books, on Broadway and 33rd.&nbsp; We also have a bunch of libraries, the thrift store on Ditmars has a book section, and the book guy on Ditmars.&nbsp; It&#039;s not like books are nowhere to be found.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would love to have a Trader Joes here and I think it would do very well!&nbsp; Astoria has changed a lot over the years and I think we could all use a quality grocery store.

				I&#039;m sure that TJ&#039;s would do well in Astoria; people here eat and like good prices. The TJ&#039;s in Rego Park is always packed; yet it&#039;s always a good experience as far as I&#039;m concerned. As far as the lack of bookstores, I&#039;d imagine that it&#039;s very difficult to run that kind of business anywhere- with Amazon and company offering much better selection and value online. You need a massive store like B&amp;N to have enough content and all that; and are those stores even doing well?

				Personally I think Trader Joe&#039;s is overrated the majority of the products there are either processed, jarred, canned and frozen...and what&#039;s the appeal of frozen organic vegetables?&nbsp; Listen we live in NYC where we can get the best of everything I mean maybe a Trader Joe&#039;s may serve a purpose in Podunk, Iowa but here?????&nbsp; I don&#039;t see it!!!

				I also don&#039;t think Trader Joes is that great. I&#039;ve been to the one in Union Square and didn&#039;t find anything that I couldn&#039;t get in<br />either Key Food or even Whole Foods. And definitely nothing that would make me wait in their lines! I&#039;d rather see Whole Foods<br />come to Astoria, but doubt that will happen. <br /><br />And I would think that if TJ did come here, they&#039;d want a spot with parking like they have now in Rego Park. And I wouldn&#039;t want <br />to be living next door to or even near TJ if they set up shop here.

				TJs has really unique and fun items that I can never find in Key Food.&nbsp; They are also very affordable.&nbsp; Whole Foods is nice and all but way out of my league, price-wise.&nbsp; But everyone is going to have their own opinion on these things.&nbsp; Not every store has to please everyone.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure Trader&#039;s could find a nice out of the way location on Northern Blvd or 21 Ave or 21 Street.&nbsp;

				Key Food for the most part is a rip off. I only shop there after I&#039;ve studied their flyer to see what&#039;s on sale. The &nbsp;quality of their produce sucks too. Best Yest has great aisles. Nice and wide. Their produce section is a step up from Key Food, for sure. Trader Joe&#039;s has great prices and great quality. Bread is priced under 3 bucks with a wide variety to choose from. We&#039;ve bought chicken from TJ -they even offer free range for a very reasonable price; pigs in a blankie, tamales, pot stickers, thai dumplings, Spanish olive oil, edamame all are great. I can easily get fat and become a wino (great wine store!) shopping there---and still maintain a budget!<br /><br />Of course I&#039;d rather have them open one in the Ditmars area. If not somewhere near the el where people getting off the train after work could easily step into the store, but then there&#039;s the problem of parking. Wonder where they&#039;ll open one...IF they open one!<br />

				Trader Joe&#039;s carries dried fruit and nuts that I like.&nbsp; Also butter and some spices.&nbsp; Oh, and almond butter.&nbsp; Coffee, chocolate, cheeses - it probably would end up having the best cheese selection of any place around Astoria, actually.&nbsp; I used to eat a lot of their pre-made foods, but don&#039;t partake in stuff like that anymore.<br /><br />I was thinking about this while on the train - where in Astoria would there be a parking lot next to a building for something like Trader Joe&#039;s?&nbsp; Perhaps off of 21st Street (boonies) or north toward Best Yet (also out of the way); neither are very practical.&nbsp; It would need to be near transit and have room for cars.&nbsp; Best location I think would be on Broadway in the low 30s, so relatively near the N/W and the R.&nbsp; It&#039;s too bad that Staples moved into that old Met grocery story - that would have been an awesome location for a TJs - right near transit AND a parking lot.<br /><br />We&#039;ll see!<br /><br />Oh, and the Podunk, Iowa comment?&nbsp; WTF?&nbsp; Trader Joe&#039;s started out in the metro Los Angeles area, in Pasadena, which is hardly the boonies. TJ&#039;s is located in a lot of cities.&nbsp; Give me a break.&nbsp; &nbsp;:roll:

				Another good location would also be near the R train at 46th street&nbsp; and 51 st.&nbsp; - right on Northern Blvd in the same general area as the Best Buy, Home Depot, and NWS Liquidators area.&nbsp; Plenty of stores there have parking lots.&nbsp; I used to live in that area and I LOVED the shopping being so close, and so great.&nbsp; Stop and Shop was ten times better than Key Food will ever be.&nbsp; TJs could open a spot in one of the many plazas on Northern and it&#039;d be fine.

				I don&#039;t think the TJ&#039;s has to have space for parking.&nbsp; The one in Brooklyn Heights (Atlantic and Court) does very well without a parking lot, and unlike the Union Square TJ&#039;s is several blocks from the subway.

				I agree StaphanieL. I&#039;d gladly make small trips on foot during the week if there&#039;s no on-site parking, or park several blocks away. We&#039;ve been to the one on Metropolitan Ave and navigating through the parking lot was a nightmare. It was packed. We usually manage to find parking on Atlantic Ave in Brooklyn, closer to the river. And if we shop at the Union Square TJ we park way over on the East Side around 1st Ave, Ave A.

				All good points, though perception of all of Queens is that the borough is suburban and car-happy (which a lot of it is), so I expect the decision makers to keep that in mind when deciding on a location.&nbsp; I personally don&#039;t care about car access, but I expect TJs to.&nbsp; <br /><br />Northern Blvd sounds like a reasonable location, too.&nbsp; Maybe Steinway Street has some big spaces available, too?&nbsp;

				In regard to a space for TJs, how about the former Rite Aid space on 31st Street &amp; Ditmars?&nbsp; Having never been inside, when I walked by earlier today and looked inside, it appeared surprisingly big.&nbsp; Might be even a good spot for a box chain book store, but then again, a lot of those stores seem to do well with a second floor (so they can throw in a bakery or coffee bar), and I don&#039;t think there&#039;s potential for an additional floor there.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, is there any word of what&#039;s going into that space yet?

Trader Joe&#039;s carries mostly their own line of products at very low prices, which makes them more similar to ALDI than Whole Foods. They also have some brand name products for very reasonable prices too - organic bath &amp; body products way cheaper than I see anywhere else. The prices and the overall quality/selection of the things they sell is why the line is so ridiculous at all times. I don&#039;t shop there often because it&#039;s kind of exhausting to navigate through the droves (the clogged aisles are worse to me than the waiting-in-line aspect), so I think of what I need ahead of time and buy stuff in bulk so I don&#039;t need to go back there too often.<br /><br />By the way, they sell honey in a bear that has the best lid I&#039;ve ever seen on a honey container. It looks ridiculous, but it is amazingly functional as well as being cheaper than the honey in a bear that&#039;s sold at Trade Fair.<br /><br />The closest Whole Foods is probably the one at Columbus Circle, but the Union Square location is the closest one to an N train stop, as far as I know.

				I like Trader Joe&#039;s, but they make their profit on high volume so unless it&#039;s a prime location or has very promising potential, I see it as unlikely. Opening a store in Astoria would only be likely if it were adjacent to other high traffic stores.<br /><br />My remark about Astorians not having many avid readers was actually from comments made by now defunct Astoria book store owners. There was a bookstore on Steinway Street near Broadway in the late 80s, didn&#039;t even last a year. I used to frequent it and asked the owner how business was going and he told me there weren&#039;t enough book buyers in the area and he has no options but to close the store. A similar remark was made by another bookstore on 34th Street in the early 1990s.I think that one lasted about one year.

				I would think that all of the varying ethnicities in Astoria would make opening a successful bookstore very challenging. To appeal to a broad group of the population, you&#039;d need a massive selection and thus a huge space. If you were just carrying English language books, then you&#039;d really limit your potential customer base in this area.

				I would love to see a TJ&#039;s or a Whole Foods open in Astoria, preferably a TJ&#039;s since it tends to be cheaper.&nbsp; :mrgreen: It&#039;s such a pain to have to run down to Union Square just to shop at these places..&nbsp; :cry:

				I completely agree with the earlier comment about Key Food.&nbsp; In fact, I read the circulars for all of the grocery stores convenient to me (four different ones).&nbsp; Then I decide which stores to shop at.&nbsp; And I will usually stock up on anything that isn&#039;t perishable if it&#039;s a good price.&nbsp; Since Key Food&#039;s produce is more expensive than I am willing to pay, I usually go to the fruit stand across the street on 30th Avenue (the one near the N train.<br /><br />The Rite Aid on Ditmars that went out of business actually would probably have been a good location for a TJ&#039;s.&nbsp; I was brainstorming locations for that earlier with my girlfriend.&nbsp; She wants it so bad, she mentioned putting it where Soleil used to be on Astoria Blvd because it&#039;s around the corner from her apartment (even though they would need about 5 times more space at least).&nbsp; I said I think they need a little more space.&nbsp; The Northern Blvd area with the big box stores seems a more likely destination which is perfectly good for me.

				Hey Trader Joe&#039;s! News Alert! Blockbuster might file for bankruptcy. If they close the store on 31st Street, Ditmars area we would love to have you take over that space.

				Why leave Astoria? Because Brooklyn has a great brew supply shop on the corner of 8th St &amp; 3rd Ave, Prospect Park, beautiful architecture, and a.......ta-da! Trader Joe&#039;s (Cobble Hill) where we purchased lots of tasty goodies, some of which were:<br />1 lb organic red cherry tomatoes--- 2.99<br />1 lb small assorted heirloom tomatoes--- 3.49<br />organic free range chicken drumsticks--- 3.18 at 1.99 lb!<br />Niman Ranch applewood smoked bacon--- 4.79<br />organic low fat vanilla yogurt 32 oz--- 2.99<br />sweet meyer lemons--- 4 for 2.49<br />2 lb haricot vert--- 5.99<br />Pacific flounder with (real) crabmeat stuffing---2.99 each<br />1 lb.frozen edamame in shell--- 1.69<br /><br />The green beans were so sweet it was almost a shame to serve with lemon and olive oil and their edamame is tastier than any other place we&#039;ve purchased them from.<br /><br />Best of all-we found parking on a side street nearby. <br /><br />Who dat say Trader Joe&#039;s is over-rated?!<br /><br />

				Why, Lanseaux? You wouldn&#039;t even know it was there if you weren&#039;t actually looking for it. It&#039;s very low profile-located in what used to be a bank from way back when. And although the place was packed it didn&#039;t feel cramped and stressful (I would know-I&#039;m kind of claustrophobic) like Key Food on 31 St.<br />&nbsp;<br />We had a meal and beers at Pete&#039;s Waterfront afterwards. I love that place. The atmosphere is wonderful, I could spend entire afternoons and evenings there. They have so many beers on tap and I had a fantastic stout called &quot;Diesel Dry Hopped&quot; by Six Point brewery. Perfect for those who love stouts and IPA&#039;s!<br /><br />Aacchh!

				<br />I wrote them a love letter a few years ago - begging them to open a store in Astoria.&nbsp; I think they&#039;re awesome and they have such interesting off-beat things (have any of you tried the dried hibiscus?&nbsp; or the spicy chocolate covered dried mango which i fondly refer to as smack?).<br /><br />My only concern is if they choose a place with a parking lot - the traffic in the Northern Blvd. area (if that&#039;s where they go) is already a nightmare, plus, as most of us who have been to the Rego Park location, navigating that parking lot is harrowing and I ALWAYS see fights there.<br /><br />I almost never go to the Union Square store (because the idea of getting on the line to check out as soon as i walk in the door is kind of a turn-off) but I have a friend who goes at like 9 every Sunday morning - she says it&#039;s manageable then.<br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;m stoked if this rumor is true!

				I think there&#039;s a lot of potential for a Trader Joe&#039;s store on 20th Avenue from about 38th to 45th streets. There are a few large warehouses for sale over there that would make good sites. The corner of 38th street was being developed for something until it apparently stalled--not sure what&#039;s happening there, but it&#039;s depressing. The upside would be plenty of parking for those who want to drive, as well as walkability for folks living in the area. It&#039;s also further enough away not to directly compete with the smaller stores on Ditmars. The downside is more car traffic, which would be significant. Still, I&#039;d much rather have a Trader Joe&#039;s than something else.

Last time I was there -maybe 3 years ago- the parking lot seemed bigger than the store!<br /><br />There would be such a feeding frenzy if Astoria were to get a Trader Joe&#039;s. It would have to be a BIG one.
