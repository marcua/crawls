				I&#39;ve never seen it here or anywhere else (I don&#39;t get out of Astoria much), but I know Sunswick had some kind of Young&#39;s something in the last year or so.<br /><br />The only British I&#39;ve seen around here has been Old Speckled Hen and Boddington&#39;s. OSH is still on tap at Sunswick, Boddington&#39;s used to be. <br /><br />Man, I miss the Cyprus Deli, where you used to be able to buy a bottle of, oh say.... Ethiopian beer? Kenyan? Tazmanian? Yugoslavian? <br /><br />That was then.&nbsp; :|<br /><br />(The exotico beers I bought at the Cyprus Deli [keeping it realistic] tasted like they&#39;d been sitting on the shelf for 8 years. )<br /><br />The champagne style beers at Heliopolis on Broadway are what they are, but I think you can get that stuff far cheaper at Costco now. If you gotz wheels.<br /><br /><br />

				Haven&#39;t had this one, but Sunswick had Sam Adams Chocolate Bock at one time.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the top two of the best beers I&#39;ve ever had.

				This reminds me of the chocolate stout at the Manhattan Brewery (now defunct)...you can have it served up with a couple of scoops of Ice Cream (ala beer float).&nbsp; I know it sounds odd...but its really good!

				Great success!.....almost.<br /><br />They had it, but they did not have a free tap and were waiting for another keg to go dry.<br /><br />We asked them which keg was the lowest, and we were kinda half-kidding. off-topic, has anyone been to sunswick for trivia night? wednesdays?<br />

				********<br /><br />It&#39;s not in Astoria, I&#39;m afraid, but the bar I work at has youngs double chocolate and their oatmeal stout as well.&nbsp; Both are mighty tasty.&nbsp; It&#39;s the Jekyll and Hyde Club in the West Village right off of the Christopher street 1 train stop.&nbsp; So it&#39;s all a matter of how far you want to go to get summa that chocolate stout.

				I apparently don&#039;t like chocolate stouts.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried them twice now.&nbsp; The House of Brews has the Brooklyn version, and I tried Sunswick&#039;s.&nbsp; For some reason I thought you would taste the chocolate.&nbsp; Nope.&nbsp; Guess I&#039;m ignorant of beers?&nbsp; &nbsp;It was too heavy and dark for me.&nbsp; Did not taste chocolate at all.&nbsp; And I really like chocolate.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-P
