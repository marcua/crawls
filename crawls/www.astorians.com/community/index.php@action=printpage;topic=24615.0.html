				Does anyone know where to find Taylor ham in Astoria??? <br /><br />Yes I&#039;m from nj and just thought all of our diners here would automatically have it. I am shocked to find that&#039;s not the case. I&#039;m having a craving and wanted to introduce my Virginia raised boyfriend to it. Now I&#039;m getting scared that I&#039;ve taken a Taylor ham, egg, and cheese sandwich for granted my whole life.

				I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve seen it outside of NJ.&nbsp; You may need to import it.

				Several years ago, the Key Food on 30th ave. stocked Taylor pork roll for about two weeks. (They sold OTC oyster crackers at the same time, so I guess they had a buyer from Jersey at the time.) I should have stocked up. :( You could go to Jersey with a cooler and dry ice and procure a supply, because like all too many things (&lt;cough&gt;hash browns&lt;/cough&gt;), it&#039;s unknown here.

He lives on LI now and buys it at his local Path Mark, so it&#039;s definitely around in the NY market.
