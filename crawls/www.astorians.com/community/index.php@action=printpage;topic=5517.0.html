				Do you frequently have to dodge dog poop on your walks? I do, and it drives me crazy. So gross. And there are no signs that warn about fines or anything. I&#039;ve submitted several complaints to the appropriate web site. I swear it&#039;s EVERYWHERE in my neighborhood.

				I am so fed up with it - Years ago - pre 311 I tried calling Sanitation to see if they could send a car to ticket people, or at least put up a Curb your Dog Sign. The manager told me I would have to bring it up to the Community Board and have them approve it. Those of you who&#039;ve gone to community meetings know what a waste of time they generally are.<br />90% or more of those pooping on my block don&#039;t live here. Some go and hide in between the buildings and do it by the garbage cans. You can come home from work - take out the trash in the dark - and suprise. I&#039;m so tempted to follow one of these neighbors home and re-deposit their gifts.&nbsp; God forbid you say something - you may be attacked by their lovely Pitbulls. Well at least there&#039;s one thing I support Vallone on.

				Dog owners seem to think that poop vanishes when it&#039;s on top of snow, when in fact it just shows up during the spring thaw. Piles and piles of it.&nbsp; :-( Don&#039;t you love that magical thinking? Like smokers who seem to think that cigarette butts just &gt;&gt;poof&lt;&lt; vanish when they hit the ground. <br /><br />Oh yeah, not just sidewalks but the park lawn.

				I tend to see more of it in the winter, particularly when it snows. The one positive thing about Guiliani was he enforced the dog poop laws, and the streets got cleaner. I think they need to start giving out tickets again to make dog owners take notice again. I&#039;m getting tired of cleaning up other people&#039;s dogs messes in front of my house.

				There&#039;s a job in Disneyworld where you have to pick up (or scrape) the horse poop from the ground, so no one steps in it.&nbsp; Every person who doesn&#039;t pick up their dog&#039;s poop, should have to run around after the horse&#039;s in central park for a day picking up all their crap!!<br /><br />But yes, let&#039;s here from you people.&nbsp; Come on, defend yourselves!!&nbsp; &nbsp;:x

				This week has been especially bad on 41st Street. A few weeks ago I saw a woman start to walk away after her dog went on the sidewalk but I stared her down until she bent down to get it. I am not a dog fan to begin with, but I am even less tolerant of dog owners that don&#039;t clean up after their pets.<br /><br />

				When I used to live on 32nd Street between 36th Avenue, I used to have to manuever around piles of crap on the sidewalk.&nbsp; Because there was poor street lighting and a factory next door, people didn&#039;t seem to have any problem with just leaving it there.&nbsp; I guess they figured that the people at the business would take care of it; they didn&#039;t.&nbsp; &nbsp;:x&nbsp; A couple of us tried to scoop it with shovels and dump it, but it was so depressing to find so much CRAP so early in the morning!&nbsp; Luckily, I don&#039;t have to deal with that anymore!

				This was the first thing I noticed about Astoria when I moved here six years ago.&nbsp; It drives me nuts!&nbsp; It&#039;s nowhere near as bad in any of the other Manhattan and Bklyn neighborhoods I frequent.&nbsp; I see it as being of a piece with the old &quot;It&#039;s not my problem&quot;/&quot;Whattayagonnado?&quot; passivity/laziness thing.&nbsp; I like Astoria very much, but not that aspect and its, uh, *discourteous* manifestations.

				I clean up after my pitbull mix (grr... why people have issues with them is a whole other rant, but this is neither the time nor the place). I spend a fortune on special bags that go into her special baggy holder that attaches to her leash -- we are never without a bag and ALWAYS clean up after her. And for what it&#039;s worth, I only throw out the bag of poop in my own trash cans or the public trash cans on the corner unless I&#039;m not near either. She also only pees off the curb (unless she has a bladder infection and can&#039;t make it all the way to the curb -- you try yanking a 70 lb. dog to the curb midstream... ). <br /><br />Unfortunately we have to dodge piles of dog crap left and right on our block. I swear, I think we&#039;re the only ones on the street who pick up after their dog! Seriously, just because the dog poops at the base of a tree in the dirt, does not mean it&#039;s okay to leave behind. I can&#039;t tell you how many times I&#039;ve stepped out of the car next to a tree in the dark and stepped in crap. Also, it&#039;s not okay to leave behind regardless of the size of your dog -- yes, little dogs poop little turds, but they are still turds nevertheless and should be picked up. <br /><br />These are probably the same people that don&#039;t bother picking up after their dog at the dog park either...

				I encounter about 1 mound of poop per every 10 feet on my walk to the train at Ditmars every day. Often it&#039;s been stepped in and smeared all over the place. I also see people walking their dogs without a leash, the dog running way ahead. I&#039;m glad I&#039;m not alone here - We need signs and enforcement!!! I&#039;ve had it! Maybe if we all show up at a town meeting or whatever it is and rant about it it will have more impact?

				I live in the 30th Avenue area and we really don&#039;t seem to be having the same problem here. I have 2 wee-wee pad trained dogs. They don&#039;t even know that they can do their business anywhere outside the house. <br /><br />I live on a block that seems to have more dogs than people. I cannot remember the last time I saw a dog off-leash, or an owner that didn&#039;t clean up. I&#039;ve always believed that it was a Community thing. If people where this happens do nothing, it will continue to be a problem. On my block if someone sees a dog do their business and the owner walk away, someone will politely remind them of their civic responsibility. But on my block, people are also deterred from feeding pigeons. <br /><br />Being a good dog owner is the responsible thing to be. There are a few rules of good ownership. Having your dog spayed or neutered, even if it is a purebred dog. (We don&#039;t have many professional purebred breeders here in Astoria!) Getting them an $8.50 ASPCA license tag. Keeping them healthy (vetted) and socialized; on leash at all times, when not in the park during off-leash hours, and cleaning up after them. <br /><br />Form block committees and take action. Post signs. Take pictures. Let dog owners know that their bad behavior is unacceptable and will no longer be tolerated. Be united in your efforts. <br /><br />And please, don&#039;t blame the dogs. They don&#039;t know any better. The owners are supposed to be the responsible ones. Confront *them* about the messes they leave behind. Confront them about their lack of license tags. This is most certainly a quality of life issue that *needs* to be dealt with.

				I have noticed an increase of dog poop as well. I live off of Broadway and 29th Street. The situation seems to be getting worse and worse. I agree with NYCMacuser that if you see someone not picking up after their dog you should definitely say some thing to them. The problem is I never see it actually see it&nbsp; happen. I have a theory that some of the dog owners who walk their dogs really late at night or really early in the morning don&#039;t pick up after their dogs because no one is watching them. I wish there was a way to install cameras to catch the people doing it and then put poop all over their front steps and see how they like it.<br />&nbsp;:x<br /><br />

				In general, I&#039;m not a confrontational person.&nbsp; I tend to be shy about confronting strangers.&nbsp; I went running in the park this morning, and witnessed someone with a doberman pinscher looking dog walk away from its crap.&nbsp; Call me a coward, but I&#039;m not about to confront the guy with the doberman, lest he sic his dog on me, I&#039;ll be a goner for sure.&nbsp; Dogs can be very protective of their owners.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t help that I was nearly killed by being mauled by one when I was younger.&nbsp; I have a phobia towards bigger dogs now, and confronting their owners is the last thing I&#039;ll probably do.&nbsp; I do support the idea of signs and community involvement though, and am hopeful that the city council does hike up those dog poop violation fines.&nbsp; But without enforcement, it doesn&#039;t really do much good.&nbsp; I&#039;d rather the cop enforce it, than little ol me though.&nbsp; &nbsp;:oops:

				Since seeing this thread last week and then walking around the nabe, I have nearly stepped in many a pile of doggy doo doo. Honestly it is getting to the point of nasty as people need to start picking up after thier dogs. If they cant pick up after thier dogs, does that mean they dont wipe themselves after they crap??? It is one thing if the dogs are crapping on the side of the walkways, however every pile I have encountered has been plop (no pun intended, well O.K. maybe a little) dead center of the sidewalk and I also love the ones where it is obvious that the dog owners just had to get back home to catch the remaining minutes of I Love New York and therefore the dog did a pop/walk combo down the sidewalk. I know it is hard to ticket the owners of the innocent animals, but this is getting a little out of control, maybe I have been more aware because of this thread, but at the same time it has saved my shoes many a morning&nbsp; :mrgreen:. Gross. Where is Divine when you need here??

That was the first thing we did after she got spayed when she was a puppy. Actually, I just sent my renewal in at the beginning of the month (they&#039;ve already cashed my check, but I haven&#039;t gotten this year&#039;s sticker yet). I think of it this way... should my dog ever get lost (providing her collar is still on her), she can be traced back to me with the number on her tag. I think $8.50 is a small price to pay for that kind of peace of mind.

				I don&#039;t want to burst your bubble, but the collar with the tag is not the best way to recover a dog. Have you ever considered chipping the dog? The cost is not prohibitive, but well worth it. I no longer keep my dogs tags on their collars. I put them on their leashes. I put <span class="bbc_u">this</span> (http://www.boomerangtags.com/page.php?c=collartags&amp;k=h) on their collars. I recommend doing it this way, especially for mixed-breed dogs, so you retain evidence of ownership ( ASPCA &amp; Rabies) in case your dog is ever lost. With a purebred dog you always have your AKC registration papers.<br /><br />Let me tell you a short story.<br /><br />About 2-3 months ago I went shopping at Best Buy. When I came out of the store with my groceries I saw a beautiful Shih Tzu roaming the parking lot. He saw me and charged towards me. I bent over to pet him and saw he had no collar on. He probably slipped the collar or ran out of the door. When I got into the car, I invited him in and he just jumped in. I drove directly to the nearest vet and had him scanned. We called his registry, and the owners and they came to pick him up within a few hours. Chipping or tattooing a dog is the very best way to be certain that, if lost, your dog will be rehomed.<br /><br />As far as licensing is concerned, the ASPCA does not have the funds to do proper animal control. People don&#039;t realize that their license fee goes to protect all the city&#039;s abandoned and stray animals. I have never understood why everyone who owns a dog doesn&#039;t license their pet for the health and safety of all those poor shelter animals. Regardless of the fact that it is the law, why would anyone who has a best friend in a canine not want to help all those other poor creatures without homes of their own.
