				I was just hired as a bartender here and this is will silence all the gossip.&nbsp; NO.&nbsp; It is not going to be another Hooters, or Canz, or some place where girls with small self esteem and equally as opposing busts go to work.&nbsp; This is going to be one hell of a sports bar.&nbsp; 80 beers on tap, 60 TVs, it is the real deal.&nbsp; And if you still need affirmation, the uniform for guys AND girls are jeans and a crew shirt they are giving us.&nbsp; Yes this bar will be in the same restaurant family as Hooters, but just because it is in the same family doesn&#039;t mean it will be the same.&nbsp; Chipotle is owned by McDonalds and, though it may not be the best analogy, they (Chipotle and McDonalds) are no where near the same quality or same neighborhood of food.&nbsp; I hope that is post will help any insight into the future of Buds Ale House and that you all at least give it one try and stop in and see what it is all about before deeming it a black spot in Astoria.&nbsp; The people running really have their act together, they know what it takes to put up a good restaurant.&nbsp; I hope to see you all there.

				and at risk of really digging an unsurmountable grave, i just wanna say that I have a cousin and two very good friends that work at Hooters and love it there.&nbsp; I have nothing against the establishment at all.&nbsp; I was merely making a comment on what others said in this blog:<br /><br /><br />http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=22490.0<br /><br /><br />regarding Canz, Hooters, and those type of restaurants posted by other Astorians.&nbsp; I was in no way knocking Hooters or making a sexist remark.&nbsp; I guess that is where the internet falls short, the way I meant for that comment to be read and the way it was read were two very different ways, and again I apologize for it.&nbsp; So before I ruin anyone else&#039;s day, or my job if my employers find this, I will say goodbye and I hope I was able to clear up any confusion or miscommunication.<br /><br /><br />Bottom line, Bud&#039;s Ale House looks like it is going to be a real hotspot in the neighborhood with an excellent staff and a rock and roll admin team behind it making it all work.&nbsp; It will be a great place to come in, try a craft beer or several, watch the game, and take a load off.&nbsp; Hope to see you all there.

				I&#039;m glad it isn&#039;t a Hooters, but I&#039;m not happy that it is a subsidiary of a national chain. With Applebees, Panera, Pizzeria Uno just around the corner I worry that this part of Astoria is getting &quot;malled,&quot; and I hate that (and I live very nearby).

				Yes you are correct Astoria is getting &quot;malled&quot; by Applebees and so on, but Bud&#039;s is a brand new place like nothing you have seen before.&nbsp; There isn&#039;t one on every corner, ie.

				Metsfn, how do you know &quot;what [I&#039;ve] seen before&quot;? One thing people on this board hate is when a business owner/manager/employee posts as if they are just a regular person, but we love when a business owner/manager/employee posts as themselves saying something like: &quot;As the manager of Bud&#039;s Ale House, I think you&#039;ll be surprised at the quality of our food and service. I invite you to come give us a try when we open.&quot; So, how&#039;s about doing that?

				I actually didn&#039;t take anything personally. I just pointed out a commonplace when owners/managers (or, as in this case, friends of the owners) post disguised as disinterested parties (the 1st post thing also makes it pretty obvious). It is great that you are enthusiastic about your friend&#039;s business and that you are helping to get the word out. I&#039;d be doing the same, except I&#039;d maybe write my post like &quot;Bud&#039;s Ale House is owned by my friend and having seen the menu and hearing him/her tell me about his/her plans for the place I think you&#039;ll be surprised at the quality of the food and service. Give it a try next week when it opens&quot; See the difference?

				I am going to try not to misspeak and unintentionally insult anyone like I did earlier.&nbsp; I am a bartender at Bud&#039;s and I will do my best to clear anything up.&nbsp; We are not a chain.&nbsp; Chains are usually defined as restaurants with national locations, but the same quality of food, service, etc.&nbsp; Essentially, in a chain, everything, from the staff to the food, is regulated and very systematic.&nbsp; If you go to an Applebees in Colorado, you will get the same food and experience as you would if you went to one in, say, Idaho.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Bud&#039;s Ale House is part of a restaurant group.&nbsp; A restaurant group is a collection of people that have more than one store in the same state.&nbsp; This is the first Bud&#039;s Ale House in the USA...so there is no way it is a chain.&nbsp; And please don&#039;t bring Hooters into this discussion.&nbsp; We are not a Hooters.&nbsp; The members of the group run a few Hooters in NY, but Bud&#039;s does not equal Hooters.&nbsp; How can I prove this?&nbsp; Everyone, men and women, will be wearing jeans (full length) and crew shirts.&nbsp; Argument settled.&nbsp; The owners of this place know what it means to have a successful restaurant, they have several in NY already and I have been treated as an individual employee, not just another face as corporations often do.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />This is the first Bud&#039;s in a hopefully long line of Bud&#039;s to make their rise in the NY area.&nbsp; I hope this cleared up any questions.&nbsp; Basically, all I am saying, is stop judging, jumping to conclusions, and assuming what will be and just come in when the doors open and see for yourself.&nbsp; I think it is exactly what the opposite end of Astoria (from Ditmars) needs.&nbsp; A down home, neighborhood sports bar without the corporate glitz and glam.&nbsp; The place is going to rock and roll and I hope you are going to join us when it does.<br /><br /><br />I hope this helped.<br /><br /><br />ps - I can&#039;t think of any national chains that have 80 beers on tap.&nbsp; Just saying.

				Thank you stish for being straightforward and taking the time to provide information. I live two blocks from the place and wouldn&#039;t have jumped to conclusions except when I walk by I saw, through the windows, piles of employment applications with the Hooters name/logo on the top. But, I get what you&#039;re saying and will reserve further judgment until the place actually opens. Good luck with your new job.

				I did the same thing, I asked Atomic Wings to jack up their hottest wings for me and still felt like they were maybe a medium on the low side...that is why I am hoping Bud&#039;s will do them right...

				If you&#039;re looking for hot wings, you can try Blackbirds. I would think that WingStop would also have good hot wings but I haven&#039;t tried those.

				I second the wings @ Blackbirds.&nbsp; &nbsp;One of the bartenders told me that one of the owners is from Buffalo, so he was particular that the wings and beef on weck be true to form.&nbsp; I lived in Buffalo when I did my BA so I can tell you they&#039;re the real deal, and their hot is properly painful.&nbsp; Haven&#039;t tried the nuclear, but I&#039;ll do that one day.&nbsp; And IMHO Wing Stop is just so-so.

Most of the original Bud&#039;s employees were gone before today, they had known that the end was near and was sick of what Bud&#039;s was becoming. The truth is Bud&#039;s wasn&#039;t paying their bills, we had mountains of past due notices from Con Ed, our cable provider, our beer distributors, and our fo</span></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue;" class="bbc_font">[/size]<span style="font-size: 14px;" class="bbc_size">od providers, and on top of that had to deal with poor management decisions. You probably won&#039;t get that version in your local paper, nor will be status remain up that long if they&#039;re checking. However we would like you all to know that for some of us Bud&#039;s was a second home, some of us formed hopefully life-long friends, and we all loved Bud&#039;s as much as some of you did at the beginning but realized that the path it was going down wasn&#039;t our exactly what we wanted to be apart of. We apologize for the obnoxiously loud club music that blasted in your ears while you all tried to eat your dinner and watch your game. We also apologize for the underage teenagers who came in the last weeks and ruined your Bud&#039;s experience entirely. We appreciate those of you who stuck by and came in to give us multiple chances or would simply come back just to see a familiar face and grab a drink with us. We turned trashy &amp; believe me we know it.</span></span>[/color]<br /><br /><br />For those of you who miss your regular favorite bartenders and servers they can found close to home at really awesome bars!! Make sure you check out these bars: The new bar Snowdonia on 34-55 32nd street! Ovelia&#039;s 34-01 30th Ave! AND for those of you who aren&#039;t afraid of traveling into Manhattan! Iron bar &amp; Grill 713 8th Avenue! And opening up next week Bottomzup &amp; grill 344 3rd ave!!<br />Thanks to everyone who always tipped us appropriately and made our days &amp; nights worth while!

				Sad news. It didn&#039;t last too long, about a year. I walked by a couple of weeks ago and made a mental note to stop in there. It looked like a nice place, though if I dropped in there to watch a game and they were blasting loud music, that would have been a turn-off.

				Some of the windows fronting Steinway are open now.<br /><br /><br />It looks like they&#039;re trying to put two bocce courts side by side immediately to the left when you walk in.&nbsp; The bocce courts would run from Steinway Street to 38th Street (that general direction anyway), the length of the wall abutting the Salvation Army.<br /><br /><br />That&#039;s what it looks like anyway.
