				A Wed. night at Bohemian beer garden is welcomed.<br />March 15. The Ides have it.<br /><br />Celebrating March birthdays, new neighbors, and hopefully no more inches of snow.<br /><br />(But I do remember that sometimes it snows in April is not just a song.<br />Easter clothes and snow sprinkles make a bizarrre mix.)<br /><br />(Flexible and open to alternatives.<br />Would 8:00 be about right?)<br /><br />Cheers.

				I kinda feel about the beer garden like Mario Batali does about seared scallops.&nbsp; Jeffrey Steingarten asked him why he would serve something as over-popular as seared scallops, and he replied that something truly good never goes in or out of style - it&#39;s always worth doing.&nbsp; I love the beer garden because as popular and crowded as it is, it&#39;s the genuine thing -- it&#39;s not an ersatz 21st century replica.&nbsp; It&#39;s the only remnant of what was once a huge part of NYC life, and it&#39;s <em>ours</em>.  And besides, you cannot beat that kielbasa!
