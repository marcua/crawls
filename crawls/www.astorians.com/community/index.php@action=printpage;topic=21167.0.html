				Hi, my name is Chris, and I am looking for a room to rent / apartment share in Astoria or other convenient parts of Queens.&nbsp; At the moment I am in the Ditmars neighborhood, and really love it - I feel more at home here than anywhere else I&#039;ve lived in the NYC area.&nbsp; &nbsp; Unfortunately the lease tenant on the place I&#039;m in inherited a Manhattan studio, and the landlord is using the opportunity to empty this apartment and renovate, so I need to find a new place between now and the end of June.<br /><br />A bit about me:&nbsp; I am a 37 year old, non-smoking single male.&nbsp; Normally I work as an electrical engineer, but at the moment I am focusing most of my attention on training for ballroom dance competitions and teaching at a dance studio in midtown, while doing some engineering consulting and smartphone app development on the side.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m fairly quiet when home (do most of my socializing in town, and generally only get back from the studio after 10pm), ready to contribute to upkeep of common spaces, and am always on time with the rent.&nbsp; &nbsp; With the exception of a four year stint across the river in Jersey, I&#039;ve always been in shared living situations since college, and find it generally works out pretty well as long as house-mates are respectful of each other.<br />

				Apologies for the double post - it looks like he also posted the info on here this evening (wasn&#039;t sure if the FB link worked): <br />&nbsp;<br />http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=21172.0 (http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=21172.0)<br /><br />

				Update: I just signed a lease on the much nicer apartment below the one I am in currently, so now instead of looking for a room I am offering two.&nbsp; Posting it momentarily...
