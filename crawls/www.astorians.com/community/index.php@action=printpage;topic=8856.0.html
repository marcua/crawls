				Since there has has always been an historical difference between Astoria and Long Island City (LIC) it would seem to me that this organization should consider formally changing its name (LICA) to include/incorporate the Astoria part of our Community. Until then, it will always be perceived as championing the needs of LIC exclusively.

				Actually, the names have waxed and waned over time. &#039;Astoria&#039; has always been a part of &#039;Long Island City&#039; if you look at the post office map which is based on history (LIC, like Brooklyn or NY, WAS a separate city at one time.) <br /><br />Look at the letterhead of old line firms like Steinway &amp; Sons or on firms facing Northern Boulevard all the way up to Woodside - they use &#039;LIC, NY.&#039; The Queens Chamber of Commerce splits Astoria and Long Island City down the middle of Broadway. <br /><br />The &#039;Astoria&#039; name (which had declined in use after it became part of LIC) became important again during the construction boom of the 1920s as it was a strong brand name for housing that echoed the elegance found in the mansions in Old Astoria. Today, Astoria is old line community with the image of ethnic foods and the like. The politically powerful Ditmars section continues to strongly push it. <br /><br />But now the neighborhood is changing and Long Island City is considered more hip and cool for the younger crowd and as a brand, is spreading north with the new developments in Dutch Kills and the waterfront. Newer groups, like Socrates, are getting on the bandwagon by using &#039;Long Island City.&#039; The Long Island City Cultural Alliance, as well as the Long Island City Art Loop reflects this new reality. The waterfront park group, as well as the area covered by this board reflects the unique link between the communities. (the writer is now dodging brickbats) <br /><br />It will not happen overnight, but my money is with Long Island City. (more objects thrown)<br /><br />But seriously, when it comes to city planning issues, the city lumps all of western Queens in one area and for all intents and purposes, in this sense, Long Island City still exists. Its smart on the part of groups like LICA to recognize this and not be under the thumb of one community board, politician, or group. <br /><br />Overdevelopment in Queens makes the problems faced by Sunnyside or Astoria or Queens Plaza linked strongly together. For example, if Dutch Kills increases their zoning, and thousands more move in, it will create problems for adjoining Sunnyside and Astoria be it sanitation, sewers, the power grid or the trains. <br /><br />What each community can take years to learn (and often finds out too late, as in the case of Dutch Kills) can be accomplished in months. Sunnyside, Hunters Point, Dutch Kills, Astoria, Ravenswood, and Steinway all have pretty much the same problems.&nbsp; <br /><br />The developers have always had success with each individual community. Divide and conquer becomes becomes very difficult, if not impossible for them if the communities targeted for development stop reinventing the wheel and start to share notes with each other. This will drive the developers, the city planning folks, and the local politicians nuts as it would be unexpected. <br /><br />We can only find good solutions that work for everyone if our communities work together. <br /><br />&nbsp;:mrgreen:<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

If people don&#039;t feel included by virtue of the name of an organization, they will not participate in the endeavors of that organization. <br /><br />Go ahead and take a poll of the average Astoria resident and ask them if LICA represents them or the special interests of the Long Island City residents. All those new developments in LIC have set themselves apart from the rest of the Community. LIC residents are no longer considered one of &quot;us.&quot; They are now our rich, property-owning second cousins who wanted nothing to do with us when they still lived in Manhattan; who crossed the East River and stole &quot;our&quot; waterfront; who get special attention from the City&#039;s bureaucrats; who don&#039;t have to worry about &quot;our&quot; parking woes; who use &quot;our&quot; public transportation without participating in the battle to improve it and who drain all our public resources without regard to the (whole) Community effect. <br /><br />Exactly why should the average Astoria resident participate on any LICA activity when Astoria held its own Public Meeting and was not proportionally represented by members of LICA? Was it because it was held in Astoria? Was it because it was organized by members of the Astoria Community? Was it because it was a radically new concept in public forums and not the usual same-old-same-old, *hand raised* PICK ME, PICK ME, I HAVE A QUESTION?<br /><br />The time has really come to bring it all together. All the little Communities (Astoria, Dutch Kills, Jackson Heights, Woodside, Sunnyside, Long Island City) suffering from the same obscene treatment from the City. The time has come for unity. All those little groups clumped together as one can really have an enormous impact on OUR quality of life. <br /><br />If LICA won&#039;t take the first step towards the unification of the same objectives, then my hope is that the new group will. Until that happens, there will be no group that will/can speak for all of us; that can have any real impact on our quality of life issues; that will be empowered to speak for all of us; that can make those powers-that-be understand that our numbers have strength at the polls. A group that represents all of us is the future for all of us. Without such a group, the area will stay splintered by geographic lines drawn in the sand by the people who have historically controlled our environment—the political demagogues.

Most of Astoria (proper) is zoned either R5 or R6, which is fairly restrictive. Many of the pre-war buildings actually don&#039;t comply with these regulations (although they are grandfathered in). So in effect new development on these lots would actually produce smaller buildings with (in theory) fewer people.

It certainly doesn&#039;t apply to everyone, but quite often the interests of existing homeowners/residents are to &quot;maintain the character of the neighborhood&quot;, which generally means limiting growth. Surely many just want sensible accommodations in improved/increased resources to handle the additional growth, but many want no growth and will start calling up &quot;the good old days&quot; and the &quot;evil developers&quot;.

				Ha ha.&#160; <br /><br />Like the &#039;arguments&#039; against landmarking, I would invite you of the build it &#039;broader bigger and better(?) set&#039; to sit down with any one of the dozens of communities that are downzoning. Share with them your insights into urban planning. There are scores of them in every borough and every level of society. Perhaps, just perhaps, they might be on to something. But they certainly need to hear your prodevelopment rant. <br /><br />Go ahead. I dare you.<br /><br />And I think anyone, like the folks at LICA, that want to share with the community those horror stories on development that are happening elsewhere, should be given a chance to state their case. If they want to bring in people into our community from areas that have looked at development, and voted for downzoning, we should give them a chance to state their case. You cannot be fearful of information unleashed into the community, can you?<br /><br />After our power grid failed last year, even if it is Con Ed&#039;s fault (a point debatable) does it make sense to add to our community&#039;s power grid big time? Do you trust Con Ed maintaining power with double digit growth in our community?<br /><br />Do you gents have any kids in school? Have you even been into a school lately to see the overcrowding? What to you have to say to them and their parents? Don&#039;t they deserve a decent education? <br /><br />And what about hospitals - we had three not too long ago - now we have what - one? Been to Astoria General&#039;s emergency room? Or do some of you, like almost all the community&#039;s developers, live elsewhere in the suburbs where the areas are strictly zoned as to not to permit these problems?<br /><br />Do you live in Dutch Kills where they closed firehouses as the put in fourteen story towers? Did you hear of stories where people&#039;s back yards are hemmed in by 5, 10, 15 buildings? <br /><br />Have you tried to drive across Astoria recently in streets newly clogged with traffic - or are you one of those Neanderthals in an SUV or a Toyota Tundra that beeps the instant a light turns green?<br /><br />The point is, as a tax payer, I want my taxes to pay for services that make things better for me. Until that happens, diverting them into development is wasting my money. <br /><br />And as to &#039;enough&#039; people in a community? I vote. I pay taxes. I have every right to want the community the way I like to see it. I really don&#039;t care for changing my community to suit people that don&#039;t even live here. <br /><br />They are a fiction. I am real.

				And I&#039;d like to send all of the Europeans back and undo the damage put against my grandfather&#039;s people, but time goes forward and does not apologize to the past. <br /><br />The thing is how to find the middle ground. There has to be an acceptable way to grow, to meet the demands of the population without just turning people away at the door.<br /><br />Gleason, while I agree with a lot of your complaints, and find them valid, it seems like you think the solution is to stop building and not let anyone new in. I&#039;ve only been here a little more than a year and it&#039;s probably not the last place I&#039;ll ever live. People should be allowed to live in varied places and have the wonderful experiences that come from that. I don&#039;t want my ability to do so to be hindered, but I also don&#039;t want to hurt the communities I go in and out of.

				You have not addressed the points I raised. I haven&#039;t a clue was to what you mean by &#039;an acceptable way to grow.&#039; <br /><br />When I walk around Greenwich Village, I don&#039;t thank that this is valid. When I walk around Old Astoria, I don&#039;t think this is valid, either. Perhaps we can continue this on the N train during rush hours. I would invite you to bring into the conversation our fellow passengers.<br /><br />The reality is that most of the city doesn&#039;t want development. Pure and simple. As most of the development will be concentrated in the areas that welcome it, they will be overwhelmed just as the poor folks at Dutch Kills and Hunters Point found out. <br /><br />Before we say that growth is natural, we should take a look at why the vast majority of people don&#039;t want this for their communities. What do they see?<br /><br />Again, I invite any of the prodevelopment crowd to speak before them with your suggestions for &#039;acceptable growth.&#039; <br />

Share with them your insights into urban planning. There are scores of them in every borough and every level of society. Perhaps, just perhaps, they might be on to something. But they certainly need to hear your prodevelopment rant. <br /><br />Go ahead. I dare you.<br /><br />And I think anyone, like the folks at LICA, that want to share with the community those horror stories on development that are happening elsewhere, should be given a chance to state their case. If they want to bring in people into our community from areas that have looked at development, and voted for downzoning, we should give them a chance to state their case. You cannot be fearful of information unleashed into the community, can you?<br /><br />After our power grid failed last year, even if it is Con Ed&#039;s fault (a point debatable) does it make sense to add to our community&#039;s power grid big time? Do you trust Con Ed maintaining power with double digit growth in our community?<br /><br />Do you gents have any kids in school? Have you even been into a school lately to see the overcrowding? What to you have to say to them and their parents? Don&#039;t they deserve a decent education? <br /><br />And what about hospitals - we had three not too long ago - now we have what - one? Been to Astoria General&#039;s emergency room? Or do some of you, like almost all the community&#039;s developers, live elsewhere in the suburbs where the areas are strictly zoned as to not to permit these problems?<br /><br />Do you live in Dutch Kills where they closed firehouses as the put in fourteen story towers? Did you hear of stories where people&#039;s back yards are hemmed in by 5, 10, 15 buildings? <br /><br />Have you tried to drive across Astoria recently in streets newly clogged with traffic - or are you one of those Neanderthals in an SUV or a Toyota Tundra that beeps the instant a light turns green?<br /><br />The point is, as a tax payer, I want my taxes to pay for services that make things better for me. Until that happens, diverting them into development is wasting my money. <br /><br />And as to &#039;enough&#039; people in a community? I vote. I pay taxes. I have every right to want the community the way I like to see it. I really don&#039;t care for changing my community to suit people that don&#039;t even live here. <br /><br />They are a fiction. I am real. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />There is a big difference between (re)development that has been carefully thought out and the type of development that you speak of. Clearly if you were going to upzone something (which isn&#039;t being done in Astoria proper, and as I pointed out above most of the buildings that are overbuilt are older) you have to make sure the necessary infrastructure is in place. That is a huge problem we are seeing in this country as a whole is the constant failure of our infrastructure. Look at the bridge in Minnesota as an example, or the blackout in 2004(?) that affected the whole northeast. Prime examples of how we have to failed to put money into our infrastructure, and we are going to be feeling the wrath of that more and more in the future if nothing is done to prevent it.<br /><br />Urban planning and development is just that. Planning and development. It isn&#039;t &quot;don&#039;t build anything ever again and don&#039;t let anyone new in&quot;. It is just that in the past few decades this has been terribly poor mired with corruption and endless bureaucracy (just to name a few).

Not one person o my knowledge. But if the neighborhood doesn’t change and adapt, people will leave it and you’ll get your wish: a place frozen in time, but with no one around and buildings falling in disrepair. Think it won’t happen? Tell that to the people of 1970s South Bronx.<br /><br />When I read your postings, many times my first reaction is to nod in agreement but then something happens – a switch is flipped or something.&nbsp; Your arguments start to wander and become diatribes lumping current problems with societal changes that started, and sometimes ended, decades ago and I’m left to wonder: &quot;what are you on about?&quot;<br /><br />And on several occasions “what are you on about” turns into “is he really saying what I think he’s saying” because I’m left feeling very uncomfortable by what I read. It’s one thing to moan about the powers that be, the real estate industry or the city, etc. I draw a line though, when the criticism ventures into discussion of the ‘type’ of people who live here. It’s an easy out when one is frustrated and I don’t like it.<br /><br />I’m with you 100% on one issue -- erecting 10–15 story towers next to one-, two- and three-family houses in areas such as Dutch Kills is unacceptable and must be stopped. But how about a smaller apartment building? That’s not out of character to what’s already there and to me seems to be a reasonable comprise (if only a developer could be bothered with smaller projects such as these). But something tells me that you’d still be unhappy. <br /><br />I share many of the same frustrations you do as I look around as see what’s happening but there’s a difference between change, appropriate development and overdevelopment and to argue in favor of constructing in-scale buildings in on reasonable sites doesn’t make me or anyone else Anti-Astoria.<br /><br />As you can see from my other thread I’m upset at the direction development has taken in LIC. A mixed-use commercial hub was proposed. What we are getting are luxury condos built in inappropriate locations -- and it’s my fear this will further impact further north into more residential areas. <br /><br />I should stop now but at the risk of becoming “diatribic” myself I’ll venture to address some of your specific points since you offered a dare:<br /><br />Con Ed:<br />Yes – the power failure is Con Ed’s fault combined with a flawed concept of privatisation and deregulation that’s been crammed down our throats.<br /><br />Increased competition was supposed to unleash the power of the market and result in lower energy bills. My Con Ed bill isn’t any lower, is yours? In fact it’s been rising for quite sometime even before the current oil crisis.<br /><br />Deregulation has enriched the moneypeople at the expense of the consumer. It’s allowed Con Ed to shift its burdens and responsibilities onto other companies (which they deny and try push back on Con Ed), and to stop investing in maintenance and essential upgrades. I think we can all agree that increased development will aggravate the situation and I have no ideas on how it can be fixed.<br /><br />Old Astoria and landmarking:<br />Do you know who I blame – the owners of those grand houses who fought against establishing a landmark district and then sold out to developers knowing full well their properties would be torn down and monstrosities built in their place. You can say it was their right to do so and you can blame the ‘city’ for not trying harder but let’s face it if residents wanted the landmarking it would have been implemented.<br /><br />Everyone in JH thought the world was going to end when the historic district was finally established but guess what? The exact opposite happened. The neighborhood has dramatically improved and the current thinking is that much of it is a result of landmarking and the leadership of committee. Let’s hope the residents of Sunnyside Gardens see similar results and provide an example to the remaining owners in Old Astoria so we can save what little is left.<br /><br />Schools:<br />What are you on about? I agree that District 30 along with many others in the city, especially Queens are bursting with students. But this is not a new issue and it’s not being ignored. Overcrowding has long been on the agenda and the Board of Ed has responded by building more schools, though not at a speed to everyone’s liking. What more do you want --mandatory birth control or a one-child policy? Or should we solve the problem by building more luxury condos who owners will likely not have children or, if they do, can afford to send them to private school?<br /><br />Hospitals: <br />What are you on about? Boulevard Hospital was closed in what – the late 70s, early 80s? I know because my parents fought hard to keep it open. I’m lost here. That battle was over nearly 30 years ago and you’re still not over it? And how is the current structure of the healthcare system the fault of current development?<br />&nbsp;<br />And if I may add: Astoria General has always been a bit of a dump but I have been to the emergency room relatively recently and to me it’s never looked better. (Though I still would go into Manhattan if I had the choice) <br />&nbsp;<br />Traffic and SUVs:<br />What are you on about? Traffic lately? When has Astoria not been beset with traffic problems? The early 1940s? I wouldn’t be surprised if the complaints started rolling in as soon as the Triborough and Grand Central were opened. <br /><br />Also two and three car families are not exactly new or news. Even if the population remained the same over the past 10+ years Astoria would still have a traffic problem with more cars per family on the road and it’s not as if oversized SUVs and inconsiderate drivers are endemic to only Astoria.<br /><br /><br />Ouch. I think I may have hurt myself. Sorry for the long post. I’m done (for the moment). <br />

				I really don&#039;t care if my opinions are mainstream or not. They&#039;re mine. I’m entitled to think as I think and offer comment as I see fit – just like you. I’m also secure in feeling I don’t need to justify my opinions to anyone.<br /><br />Believe it or not, we have much common ground in our views otherwise I wouldn’t be wasting my time replying. You’re a lifer, so when similar when it comes to that, but in my opinion you are living in the past. You’re ranting to save a way of life that’s already been lost. <br /><br />If you had the power to wake up tomorrow and magically be able to preserve every square inch of Astoria, every building, house, store, park or tree as is it currently stands it would be a fruitless endeavor because the neighborhood as you know it will still disappear. It’s not just real estate that makes a community -- it’s people – and people die, they move out and move on. New people are born and move in. That’s the way of the world.<br /><br />To which community do you refer that is in the process of down-zoning? Astoria and LIC are not the only places in New York experiencing tremendous change. It’s happened to differing extents throughout the borough of Queens. In fact it’s a city-wide, including Manhattan. Do you think all the residents of Chelsea are happy with what’s happening in their area?<br /><br />Change can’t be stopped, it can only be managed and I think we are in agreement that when it comes to Astoria and LIC it could be managed in a much better way than it currently is.<br />

				Well, actually the build build build mentality is yesterday&#039;s news. Remember back in the 60s?

That there is excess capacity for the foreseeable future for the double digit growth that our community has been subjected to over the past few decades? More and more people in NYC are deciding their taxes should be used for them, and their families, not for the develpers. Their needs come first.

This planet cannot sustain this growth for much longer -- we are looking at a matter of years not decades before we have to make some tough choices.<br /><br />Bringing more people into a community with inadequate infrastructure to support them, be it hospitals, sanitation, police, fire, schools, electricity or whatever is not only wrong, but bordering on criminal.

				Hahaha.&nbsp; Moooooooo!<br /><br />I believe that denser is better, too, and believe that suburban sprawl is the bane of our existence.&nbsp; It was one of the huge reasons I moved to NYC; it&#039;s one of the few cities you can get to just about everything you need with relative ease via public transportation.&nbsp; <br /><br />When you talk about highways becoming the &quot;endless treadmill,&quot; it is because of this sprawl and the growing ease of mobility.&nbsp; At one time, when Astoria looked like the picture above, it took a LONG time for someone to get into the city.&nbsp; Imagine your commute to Downtown on horseback and no bridges over the East River.&nbsp; Think many people did it?&nbsp; Nope; they lived where they worked and vice versa. <br /><br />I like the fact that there is a push for denser development in urban areas again.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s great to be able to walk everywhere that I need and not be reliant on a car.&nbsp; When you get out there in suburbia, travel everywhere in your car, and constantly have a cell phone glued to your ear, you&#039;re cutting yourself off from the rest of the world.&nbsp; While, sure, I like the idea of a yard and can get frustrated at times being a$$ to crotch with people on the subway or slow walkers, I love the feel of having so many people around, together, and walking everywhere.&nbsp; <br /><br />NYC is one of the last few places this happens.&nbsp; Ditmars is probably equivalent to the busiest pedestrian drag in Austin; and that can&#039;t compare because it&#039;s technically UT campus.&nbsp; Where I was born and raised (Dayton, Ohio) you&#039;ll hardly see ANYONE downtown and very, very few people actually live, shop, eat, hang out there.&nbsp; It is kinda sad to look through pictures of the city in the early-middle half of the 20th century when the streets were filled with people and shops and realize that it&#039;s likely gone forever.

I recall no instances at all of real feuding like the press would have led readers to believe happened. <br /><br />The opposition was not only poorly organized, but relied upon some pretty fuzzy arguments. Mostly they engaged in race-baiting by trying to portray the preservationists as being anti-everybody, and by trying to instill fear into homeowners by making outrageous claims. One of their organizers told me that it would cost $9,000 to replace my front door if my house was landmarked! Well, not only is the latter pure baloney, but the residents who testified in favor of landmarking at the LPC were a veritable United Nations.

				So is the idea now just to landmark everything everywhere in an effort to freeze all further development? <br /><br />Things have to get much more stressed before they get better. The 4/5/6 on the east side runs at like 110% capacity all the time, they have enormous financial and political clout I&#039;m sure, and they&#039;re just getting additional transportation after decades (assuming it&#039;s not put on hold again -- a big assumption). And the LIRR is finally going to Grand Central -- after over half a century of growth in LI.<br /><br />I&#039;m certainly not saying everyone should passively allow 15-story towers in single-home neighborhoods, or not fight for increased services and funding. And landmarked areas are generally positive factors to most neighborhoods (I dunno if numbers back this up, but marketing-wise it certainly does). But thinking freezing *all* growth in the meantime -- which it sounds like some people are advocating -- will help matters seems counter-productive to how things actually work.

It’s helpful to now know who “they” is. Next we need to tackle the composition of “us”.<br /><br /><br />And there’s something I should mention in case it’s not clear: I am <strong>IN FAVOR </strong> of creating historic districts and landmarking buildings, there should be more of it especially in Queens, which has been ill-served, dismissed and its history treated with disrespect. I&#039;m glad the climate is changing and people are more open to it.<br /><br /><br />One question remains for me though: If the opposition was so poorly organized why has it taken so long to get landmark status in Sunnyside? <br /><br />To simply say politicians, newspapers (i.e., local freebie papers which rely on the real estate industry for revenue) and “experts” were against the idea doesn’t work for me. <br />Most politicians are also against raising the subway fare but it happens anyway because we all know it’s more complicated than that. <br /><br />If the residents and homeowners of Sunnyside were so keen on historic preservation then the landmark designation should have sailed through the process.<br /><br />As Squirrel states, it didn’t happen this way. Creating a historic district in Sunnyside wasn&#039;t exactly a new idea – it’s was kicked around for quite sometime before people started to take it seriously and then an equal amount of time was spent by those enlightened folk who wanted it to make it happen.<br /><br />The fact that there was little opposition in the end means to me that people realized the organising committee made their argument and the case for landmarking was won. <br /><br />There doesn’t have to be an official “Anti-Historic District Committee” with dues paying members in order for people to be against landmarking. There were plenty of people working on their own in opposition and general &quot;public&quot; anti-landmark sentiment, for years, even before the pro-landmark people organized – and these are the people who make politicians nervous. It’s easy to count up those in favor on issues such as this, just go to the meetings. Not so much easy to conduct a census of those on the other side and to be fair they vote too. <br /><br />What’s missing here is perspective: In Sunnyside, the major issues <strong>in the past</strong> were privatization of shared gardens/space, paving front gardens for parking, window treatments and cladding – mainly cosmetic disputes (I&#039;m sure someone will correct me if I haven&#039;t got that right.)<br /><br />I think what turned the tide, and convinced residents in Sunnyside, is that they were finally woken up by what’s happening in the rest of Sunnyside, LIC and Astoria. Somehow quibbling over the right type of windows pales in comparison to idea of your attached neighbor’s house being torn down and replaced by a horror double in size.<br /><br />To me it’s all a case of pro preservation people (us) making a persuasive argument to residents (also us) and more importantly the owners of properties (again, also us) who maybe anti, sceptical, fearful, or may not be aware of the benefits that landmark designation is something that will benefit them – no easy task I know and it can takes years. Once that is accomplished the press and politicians (they) will follow.<br />

				Landmarking is a slow process for a number of reasons.&nbsp; First, the Landmarks Preservation Commission has a small staff and it&#039;s a big city.&nbsp; The staff has to do the historic research on the individual buildings in the area under consideration, prepare a report and also determine the community support and finalize the boundaries of the proposed district - it often changes as the proposal moves forward.&nbsp; The process includes community board review and hearings at the Landmarks Preservation Commission.&nbsp; The proposed NoHo district got divided into three pieces and the final part is only now getting hearings, about a decade after the initial work began.&nbsp; Sunnyside Gardens seemed to move fast compared to some of the other possible districts in the city.

				Thanks for the explanations Squirrel and McDirk – much appreciated.<br /><br />You are both obviously more familiar with the intricacies of the landmarking process than I am, especially you Squirrel, were you directly involved in Sunnyside? If so, when was the official application made to the LPC and who made it? I don’t know how the process works but I gather the LPC has to be petitioned in some way?<br /><br /><br />The SG district as it stands now may have been approved relatively quickly compared to others around the city but the length of time depends on when the clock started ticking.<br /><br />As I remember it, preservation forces in Sunnyside were mobilized as far back as the late 1970s and to my knowledge the idea of creating a historic district was floated back in the 80s. It’s now almost 20 years later.<br /><br />Check these links for more details on the history of preservation battle:<br /><br />http://www.sunnysidegardens.org/preservation/preservation.html (http://www.sunnysidegardens.org/preservation/preservation.html)<br /><br />http://www.astorialic.org/preservation/20031104newsday_p.php (http://www.astorialic.org/preservation/20031104newsday_p.php)<br /><br /><br />Squirrel, you talk about organized opposition&nbsp; – the point I am trying to make is that in my opinion it was unorganized opposition that delayed establishment of landmark status. The end game may have been smooth-sailing but in the decades previous the debate was quite rancorous.<br /><br />There would always be a small group of organzied hardcore opposers who, though few in number, would make a lot of noise. But I still think it was the sentiments of the “undecided” who determined the outcome.<br /><br />Convincing the undecideds, first of the need of a historic district and then to either to support the specific plan or realize that a tipping point had been reached where they couldn’t do anything about it – was where the battle was fought. Otherwise what was the point of campaigning and collecting signatures for 30 years?<br /><br />What I’m arguing is if a majority of residents believe preserving the character of their neighborhood is a worthy cause there wouldn’t be a need for landmark designation in the first place – it would automatically be a priority and you wouldn’t need a law to enforce it. Or in absence of that, at the least, residents should be clamoring for landmark status as a matter of civic pride or reas a direct response to a development threat (in the case of SG when the threat first appeared 30 years ago). <br /><br />I know that’s “perfect world” way of thinking but it’s how I feel. You can’t expect politicians, the press or the experts, i.e., outside forces, want it more than residents themselves.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=8856.msg105081.html#msg105081">Quote from: TAG on December 13, 2007, 08:26:42 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">What does it mean when people here are discussing landmarking -- what parts of Astoria would be likely candidates?

Sunnyside Gardens is a planned community with distinct boundaries. In Astoria, there are many, many buildings worth preserving but not large areas. Likely candidates that come to my mind are the Matthew model flats on/around Grand Avenue and obviously Old Astoria south of Astoria Park, but so much has been lost already. If it takes 20+ years to approve landing mark – nothing will be left.

				Well, when a building or area is declared a city landmark, any real exterior changes must be approved by the Landmarks Preservation Commission. The LPC &quot;grandfathers in&quot; the buildings as they are when the district is designated, so people don&#039;t have to go out and restore their buildings to the way they looked originally. However, any changes made to the exteriors have to resemble what made the building special. For example, the owner cannot build an extension, cover a building in pink siding, or, in the case of SG, rip up the garden and put in a nice ugly carport. <br /><br />The majority of applications for building work are approved on an administrative level by the LPC, usually fairly quickly. The LPC has very knowledgeable staff who try to work with homeowners to come up with practical solutions. A few really major projects require approval of the Commission via a hearing process.&nbsp; <br /><br />Here are answers to a few of the common pieces of misinformation put out there by landmarking opponents, who like to resort to scare-tactics and race-baiting:<br /><br />Landmarking does not hurt property values.&nbsp; In fact, one study shows that it helps raise them!<br /><br />Landmarking does not create a housing shortage. They LPC does not regulate the interiors of homes, so the number of units in a building can remain the same. <br /><br />The LPC does not regulate what you plant in your garden.<br /><br />The LPC could care less what you do to the interior of your home.<br /><br />The LPC will consider alternative materials if they resemble the real thing. For example, slate roofs can sometimes be replaced with quality substitutes. <br /><br />There is financial assistance to low-income homeowners who need to make repairs. <br /><br />Landmarking advocates are NOT Archie Bunker-types who want to drive minorities or immigrants away.&nbsp; In fact, the people testifying on behalf of SG&#039;s designation resembled the United Nations. <br /><br />Most minor repairs get approved quickly and painlessly. <br /><br />Landmarking protects the homeowner&#039;s investment. Living in a historic district means that my property values won&#039;t be hurt because some clod tears down his home next door and puts up what resembles a stack of shoe boxes. <br /><br />Landmarking does not interfere with rent control or rent stabilization.<br /><br />As for buildings of under 6 units, landlords in these are already allowed to charge market rates, so when a house is landmarked it has no impact upon how much rent tenants pay, or how much a landlord may charge. <br /><br />I hope this clarifies a few things.&nbsp; As for what parts of Astoria should be landmarked, that is up for discussion. I for one would love to see the beautiful homes and churches in Old Astoria Village preserved. <br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				Saw an ad on the subway not too long ago for &quot;Luxury&quot; coops in Williamsburg.&nbsp; Seems like every community close to Manhattan is experiencing the same thing:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; People move there because it&#039;s convenient; rents are affordable and they just plain like the place.<br /><br />2.&nbsp; Yuppies get wind of the &quot;trendy&quot; new area, and a market is created for &quot;high-end&quot; housing. <br /><br />3.&nbsp; The developers come in, and promptly spoil whatever it was that made the area attractive in the first place.&nbsp; <br /><br />These yuppies are whom the developers count on. They know that Wall Street types will spend big bucks to have a short commute, and to feel like they&#039;re part of the artist or ethnic scenes. Throw in a few fancy amenities and an ordinary apartment house becomes &quot;luxury.&quot; <br /><br />Right now real estate people are trying to sell folks on &quot;East Williamsburg.&quot;&nbsp; Last time I looked at the map, that was Bushwick. Then there&#039;s Red Hook, which is not even convenient to public transit, but which is still &quot;hot.&quot; And I am even hearing about people &quot;settling&quot; in the South Bronx!&nbsp; (Call it SoBro). <br /><br />What areas have stayed relatively low-density, despite their proximity to Manhattan?&nbsp; Brooklyn Heights, Cobble Hill, Fort Greene, etc.&nbsp; What do they have in common?&nbsp; Landmark status! (Developers hate those dreaded brown street signs!) And residents who give a hoot. No, these communities are not exactly mixed-income. But at least they are not packed like sardine cans. <br /><br />I am not naive. I know that not all of Astoria can be landmarked. But&nbsp; parts CAN be. Old Astoria Village for one. Norwood Gardens. Casa Galicia. I&#039;m sure there are others.
