				<div style="text-align: left;">Hi all, </div><br /><div style="text-align: left;">I&#039;m a 24-year old working full time for an art organization/film festival, seeking a room to rent or a roommate in Astoria. I&#039;d like to spend up to $800/month, for May/June move-in. I&#039;m a very easygoing and low-key person. I like going out and hanging out with friends, but also appreciate quiet time at home. I&#039;m neat, respectful, and don&#039;t smoke. I&#039;m crafty, love art, traveling, and everything French.</div><br /><div style="text-align: left;">If you have a room to rent or are looking for a roommate and think we would get along, feel free to send me a message!</div><br /><div style="text-align: left;">Thanks,</div><div style="text-align: left;">Katie</div>

				Hello, <br /><br /><br />I am 23. I currently live in NJ with my French boyfriend :) - but I am looking to move out on my own soon. I also would like to spend up to $800/month. I work in midtown west as an executive assistant. I am clean, quiet, and go out on the weekends. <br /><br /><br />Let me know if you would like more information. And I would like to get an idea of what kind of apartments you are looking at. <br /><br /><br />Have a great day!<br /><br /><br />Jess

				<br />Hi!<br /><br /><br />I have a room in Astoria (31-65 23rd street) for $750 starting from June 1. It&#039;s really a good sized room- I have a queen bed, a dresser a desk and electric piano and I still have room to do yoga in here. The commute to Midtown is 25 mins door to door, and all the conveniences that you could want are close by: there is a laundromat, Rite Aid, Associated grocery store and Post Office literally across the street. There are many shops and restaurants along Broadway. It&#039;s really quite lovely! You would be living with two males in their mid 20&#039;s (and both speak French- one fluently and one learning).<br /><br /><br />Please get in touch if you&#039;re interested!<br /><br /><br />Julie
