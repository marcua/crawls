			I&#039;ve noticed, when I&#039;ve passed Thai Elephant after 7:00 PM these past few days, that it&#039;s been closed.&nbsp; The restaurant had already been closed, for some time, on Wednesdays. However, it had rarely been closed on other days.&nbsp; Does anyone know if it&#039;s gone of out business? :sad:
