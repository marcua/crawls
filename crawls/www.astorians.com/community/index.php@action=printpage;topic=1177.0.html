				Mmmmmm.....SilkNog! &nbsp; Quite tasty as far as mass produced eggnog goes. &nbsp;And it doesn't creep me out like some of the heavier milk-based eggnogs. &nbsp;Yum!!!

				I saw the Silknog the other day and stopped in my tracks and stared at it for a while. &nbsp;(mesmerized and drooling most likely) Then i decided it was one of those marketing things... where I suddenly want something that I know that I don't need and didn't have any desire to have it before I walked into the store. &nbsp;Of course the Silk people know you don't need it - you've never ever heard of it until you stumble over the display - at the entrance to the supermarket - it took much strength... and I probably didn't want to carry the extra weight down the street... but I faught the urge...<br />However.. the fact that you gave it a thumbs up will now stay with me and i'm sure it will be much more difficult to fight the forces the next time i'm confronted.

				Silknog is one of my favorite things ever...I look forward to it every year. &nbsp;Although...if it were available year-round, it probably wouldn't be such a treat.

				That was Jen. I have only recently discovered that soy milk is actually a decent tasting product. &nbsp;the coffee flavored is nice but soy is best with chocolate syrup.<br /><br />I did have home made eggnog one time with lots of wiskey in it and that was fantastic. &nbsp;friends made it for st patricks day and we watched the quiet man with john wayne. &nbsp;a very irish day.<br /><br />for future reference, if you see my name attached to a post about:<br />jeans, shopping for clothes/shoes, soy milk, girly things, backgammon, it is definitely jen forgetting to post under her own name.
