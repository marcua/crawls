				The race will be over by early February, 2008.&nbsp; He has money, which makes him more competitive than he would have been, but the race will be over even faster than the Kerry nomination due to accelerated primary schedule.

				By protracted do they mean it will still be going on after 2007?&nbsp; &nbsp;:?<br />Do voters actually have to vote?<br /><br />It will be interesting to see which endorsements come out early.<br />Who(m) do you think Mondale or Gore will endorse?&nbsp; &nbsp; :|&nbsp; &nbsp; :evil:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=5856.msg66949.html#msg66949">Quote from: Astoria Luv on April 05, 2007, 08:31:50 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">This article was in today&#039;s Washington Post regarding Obama&#039;s fundraising.<br /><br />http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/04/AR2007040400989.html<br /><br />First paragraph reads <br /><br />&quot;Sen.

				I think after the first two or three states, it will be over, which really bites.&nbsp; I think mid February, 2008, we&#039;ll have a nominee.<br />Does the Mondale endorsement help at all?<br />I still think Gore could run, though I think it&#039;s less likely at this point.<br />I find it interesting that Obama is going down in the polls in NH and Iowa, though he is very competitive right now in the fiscal race.

				I kinda thought this early primary thing was just a way to quickly pick the candidates so they have more time to raise money for the big run for Pres.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure the policy wonks in DC consider the money spent on capturing the primaries a waste when it could all go to the appointed champion.&nbsp; But I have some friends who insist that earlier primaries are better for democracy because it&#039;ll get people involved sooner, although they often seem unclear on what rationale they&#039;re using for that opinion.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m curious what everyone else&#039;s thoughts are on the new early primaries and the state of primaries in general.<br /><br />(Talk amoungst yourselves.&nbsp; I&#039;ll give you a topic... the general assembly is neither general nor an assembly... discuss.)
