				It just ended! Tony, his wife, and AJ are waiting for Meadow (she&#039;s outside parking her car)&nbsp; at a restaurant for dinner and there were a few suspicious guys in the place as well... One of the guys goes to the bathroom and you think something is gonna happen when all of a sudden the screen goes blank (for like 30 seconds) and the credits come a rolling on the screen. <br />THATS IT! Thats how it ended.

				possibly one of the worst endings ever in television history. the whole episode was awful.<br /><br />that being said, i just read an interesting take on this...<br /><br /><em>Tony IS DEAD and WAS CLIPPED by someone. We the audience have always seen the episodes from Tony&#039;s point of view, and the blackened silence is what Tony sees and hears when he finally gets clipped. Remember the conversation with Bobby at the lake? &quot;I wonder if you hear the one that gets you&quot; - the final episode answers that question. That is why they flashed back to it at the end of last weeks episode. He never heard the one that killed him.</em>

				Wow......when you put it that way........<br /><br />A lot of the violence in the show was realistic, and gory. This was a good twist in that it was realistic and not gory. Maybe a quick, sudden death is in fact totally anticlimactic. Scary nonetheless. But at least give people an idea what the hell&#039;s going on so they can appreciate the effect.

				Initially, I didnt like it, but after some reading, and recalling the bobby conversation on the boat, i liked it. I just dont understand why choose to end on meadow, why not end with camera on tony, and maybe the sound of the bathroom door swinging open (assuming that guy is aboutto whack tony).

				They did end with Tony.&nbsp; Meadow opened the door to the diner (although we don&#039;t see it, we hear it) and he looks up.&nbsp; The camera is on him then boom...black screen.<br /><br />I do like the theory as stated above.&nbsp; It makes me feel better about the episode.&nbsp; I just think it was executed poorly.

				Yay, my turn.<br /><br />First off, I&#039;m going to miss this show.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think any ending would have made me happy, because I didn&#039;t want to see this series end ever.&nbsp; But I didn&#039;t think it was so bad.&nbsp; I read in the Sopranos edition of Vanity Fair that David Chase, the shows creator, had no intention of wrapping the whole thing up in a neat bow.&nbsp; And he didn&#039;t.&nbsp; There&#039;s a conceit that when a show ends that world the characters inhabited must end, like the idea that when you close your eyes the world disappears.&nbsp; But thats not how things happen in real life.&nbsp; Sure Sil and Bobby (poor Bobby) are gone but Tony lives on and his life goes on.&nbsp; Carm&#039;s going back to the spec house business, Meadow&#039;s getting married and AJ may finally be on the right track, and Tony is probably going to be indicted.&nbsp; Paulie is taking over the cursed crew (which I have always pointed out to my friends that capos of that crew always end badly) despite reservations.&nbsp; New York got rid of Phil but whose gonna run it now?&nbsp; We don&#039;t know the answer to any of these questions and probably never will.&nbsp; Like a friend who moves far away and loses touch.<br /><br />I liked the cat, does anyone else think its supposed to be the spirit of Chrissy?&nbsp; And did anyone notice that one of the suspicious guys in the diner, the one who uses the bathroom, was wearing the same Members Only jacket as Eugene in his final episode?&nbsp; Speaking of the final scene, here&#039;s what I think it means.&nbsp; That look up, cut too black, tense moment is a reminder that this is Tony&#039;s life and always will be, a world of suspicion and deadly peril around every innocuous moment.&nbsp; Because of what he does Tony, and his family, can never truly relax.&nbsp; Chase was always good at showing us the bad side of being a mobster and not just the money and power.&nbsp; To me this was his last reminder to us that being a mob boss isn&#039;t all its cracked up to be.&nbsp; But the first thing I thought was that my girlfriend&#039;s cable went out.<br /><br />Also I&#039;m glad that Phil&#039;s face got mangled just like he did to Vito&#039;s, no open casket for him.&nbsp; Karma... although I think that from a different show.

				I liked it. I&#039;m happy Tony was alive in the last scene. Now Sunday nights will suck again. I do wish Silvio had survived (mentally) the season--he had a very expressive upper body, even though he moved like he had no joints or vertebrae. Being stuck with Paulie--oh yuck. <br /><br />we also rushed to the dvr and clicked it thinking the ending had not been recorded.

				AFter reading about the theory on not hearing the one that gets you, i&#039;m sold, and I liked the episode a lot more. I want to watch it again to catch any nuances that I might have missed...like how he appeared to make amends with people in his life (junior, his sister, his son with the hair ruffle, his daughter with the impressed reaction at her possible salary, his final confession that his mother was a nasty bitch, his treatment of the kitty that seemed to like chris) might have all been these subtle goodbyes, and passing the torch to Paulie. <br /><br />It kind of makes sense, and the alleged movie that is coming out is supposed to be a prequel...so I guess we&#039;ll see. As frustrated as I was, I&#039;m going to watch it again. I too remember Meadow as the last thing Tony saw, which gives more credibility to him being shot, as we saw the last thing he saw.

				I watched the ending again this morning on AOL and that&#039;s how they had it.&nbsp; <br /><br />http://news.aol.com/entertainment/tv/articles/_a/no-easy-ending-for-the-sopranos/20070611065109990001<br /><br />I pretty much figured it to be the same when I watched it last night.&nbsp; I don&#039;t see why our ending would&#039;ve been cut 1 second short but you never know...anything is possible.

				the ending was brilliant.<br />first of all the last 2-3 minutes were the most intense moments i ever watched on TV.<br />cutting back to the door with the dinging when the door opens.<br />showing all this NON ITALIAN characters (and i say that because if you watched this show did you ever see any whacking done by a non Italian Mafioso type?<br />Cutting to Meadow trying to park and hoping she doesn&#039;t succeed because if she does she might get whacked with the whole family. It was intense.<br /><br />I thought the ending was great because Tony&#039;s life is alot worst when he is alive then dead. Death would have been too easy because now he has to go through life looking out for one of Phil&#039;s family members to come and kill him, and another big problem he has coming up soon is a big trial. Do you remember when the lawyer who couldn&#039;t get the ketchup out told him its almost certain an indictment is coming soon.<br /><br />I think we also learned that Tony did used Melfy all this years. When he came to see AJ&#039;s doctor he started the self pity immediately (did you see the look Carmela gave him? i get that look from my wife when she is really pissed too. lol)<br /><br />Basically what Chase wanted to say is this life is alot harder and not as glamoruse as the movies make it out to be (and also leaves room for a big movie in 2 years) Brilliant.

				Interesting.&nbsp; I totally thought my mind played a trick on me which is why I haven&#039;t brought it up but does anyone else remember Tony walking into the diner and actually seeing himself in the booth?&nbsp; Anyway...<br /><br />a repost from a myspace bulletin:&nbsp; <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">When Tony walks into the diner he looks at himself sitting down at the table...you can be sure of this b/c he is wearing different clothes when he sits down. In the previous seasons it had been told to us that Tony&#039;s dad died just as his daughter (Janice) walked in...if you watch closely you will see Janice walk in shortly after Tony sits down...this is used to signify the possibility of that happening again. Then you will see the sports store owner who Tony destroyed walk in wearing a brown kinda hunting jacket...he is the guy that a couple seasons back got into gambling trouble with tony and tony took over his store...HE IS THE ONE WHO WACKS TONY...he comes in and sits down hunched over...hiding his eyes as not wanting to be noticed...and alas...a voice over: &quot;You probably dont even here it when it happens rite?&quot; (this is Bobby talking to Tony in the 1st episode of the season...Tony had this flashback as he was laying down in the last episode...there would be no reason to have had that in unless it had some huge significance...and finally...Tony&#039;s daughter walking in to see her dad get shot just as Janice did so many years ago. You hear the bell of her walking in and then blackness...nothing...it signifies the neverending cycle of the SOPRANO family. AJ will become Tony...Meadow<br />will become Janice...Carmela will become Livia (Tony&#039;s mom)...and the cycle of violence goes on and on and on....absolutlely amazing!!! I HATED the ending at first but when I wached it again...and understood it...it is really the most amazing ending possible for the show. We really would not have been satisfied with the boring &quot;Tony getting shot in the head&quot; ending. This was priceless. Remember, this was not an action show...it was a drama<br />about a FAMILY...<br /><br />Now all you DVR-ers need to go home and watch it again and again and again!</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				nevermind - <br /><br />I just watched the ending again and it appears to play out that way but it doesn&#039;t.&nbsp; Well, some if it anyway.&nbsp; M&#039;eh.&nbsp; My thoughts on the whole thing after reading several theories and watching it again is that Tony was in fact killed by the dude in the Members Only Jacket (he was actually credited as the man in the members only jacket - lol)&nbsp; The conversation between him and Bobby in the boat makes perfect sense and is now my reasoning as to why I believe Tony was whacked.&nbsp; <br /><br />OK, I&#039;m having trouble putting my opinion into words so hopefully the above makes sense.

				I&#039;ve read every theory and interpretation out there, and after alittle research and reviewing the last 5 minutes several times....<br /><br />1. Tony is in fact wearing the same shirt when he walks in as when he sits down. One theory I heard was that he was wearing a different shirt, implying tony was imagining the scene..<br /><br />2. As for the MO jacket guy being Phil&#039;s nephew from a previous episode, the actor, Paola Colandrea (from the credits) was never credited in any previous episode. <br /><br />3. As for the 2 black dudes being the guys who tried to whack tony a few years ago (only got him in the ear) same as above, neither was credited before last night<br /><br />4. Same with the truck driver dude, who i read was the brother of a truck driver christopher killed during a hijacking in one of the early episodes (the brother identified the dead driver).<br /><br />5. Meadow does not have a look of dread on her face as she is running in. She isn&#039;t even looking into the restaurant, rather at the curb as she enters. <br /><br />So my final opinion, and what i think chase was trying to get across, was that the 5 minutes of gut wrenching suspense we were feeling during those last moments was what tony will have to feel the rest of his life, constantly looking over his shoulder and having to think twice about innocent things like a regular guy walking into a restaurant. One other thing, the guy in the MO jacket looks around the restaurant a few times, but never seems to look at tony directly, more just a scan of the place......and yes, i have alot of time on my hands. I miss the show already.

				LOL.&nbsp; OK, yeah...I noticed the shirts were the same, as well, upon watching it again.&nbsp; He just took his jacket off.&nbsp; I now know that Tony didn&#039;t actually see himself in the situation, but, at first watch that&#039;s exactly what it looks like.&nbsp; <br /><br />I feel sorry for those who don&#039;t have DVR/TIVO/Any other type of recording device.&nbsp; I&#039;d be wracking my brains out if I couldn&#039;t go back and watch it.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; EVEN FOR A FRIGGIN TELEVISON SHOW.&nbsp; <br /><br />This show has been a part of my life since season one:episode one.&nbsp; Like I said, my opinion on the episode has changed since last night but I still don&#039;t find the ending MIND BLOWING.&nbsp; Maybe I&#039;m angry that I have to use my bean a bit.&nbsp; &nbsp;:wink:

				You want mindblowing jenny jennerstein... it was a FLASH FORWARD!!!!!&nbsp; Wait wrong show.&nbsp; :lol:<br /><br />I don&#039;t think the guys who look like other guys were supposed to be exactly the ghost counterparts, only remind us of them, the various ghosts Tony will always have following him.&nbsp; Members Only was supposed to Eugene, the guy who ung himself at the beginning of last season (because he couldn&#039;t get out), guy in hat was supposed to be that guy who always wore a hat that Tony whacked b/c he flipped (always met him at a diner, bought him the &quot;art&quot; of the rat pack and was in Tony&#039;s dream seq when Tony B shot Phil&#039;s brother can&#039;t remember the character&#039;s name but you know what I mean), the black dudes were the black guys Uncle Junior hired to killed Tony, and I&#039;m sure there were others I didn&#039;t notice.&nbsp; But it was literally them, this show has always had lots of weird imagery that turned out to be just that, imagery.&nbsp; That&#039;s my take on it.<br /><br />As for the movie prequel rumors, I had heard that Chase was done with Sopranos, but who knows?&nbsp; I know my best friend said that if they did do a new series, a prequel set during Johnny and Junior&#039;s time would be cool, and I agree, I always loved Junior (that one flash back with the finger, the young Junior looked just like I thought he would with those big ass glasses) and hated seeing less of him as he went to seed.&nbsp; And that would mean a young punk Paulie, probably my favorite non-Soprano after Silvio.&nbsp; So I kinda hope they do do it. <br /><br />And I will also miss the Sopranos. A&amp;E versions just don&#039;t do it for me.

				That has to be one of the most brilliant episodes in the history of television. Absolutely brilliant. David Chase (show creator) has stated that he doesn&#039;t like episodic television where everything gets wrapped up because life isn&#039;t like that. Things are left unresolved, unfinished, ambiguous. People come and go and we don&#039;t know when or why.<br /><br />The quick cut to black to me says that he got killed -- if not right there, then eventually. And that&#039;s how he&#039;ll go. Bang. Gone. No resolution, or chase through the alleys of Jersey City, or ferocious gun battle in night club. That&#039;s the life -- an evil life -- that this man has chosen. The violence goes on, the criminality goes on. The betrayal and paranoia. It&#039;s larger than Tony Soprano, who merely showed up on its gruesome stage for a spell... And it doesn&#039;t change the fact that he&#039;d have it coming, as do all of them.<br /><br />Hats off to Chase for pulling one helluva courageous move. He reminded us that while Tony&#039;s life was compelling, in the end this really wasn&#039;t someone we were supposed to care about, or sympathize with.

				imo the show ended that way becasue....<br /><br />it lets you create your own ending, it leaves of with the family all happy and together, thats for the people who dont want to see TOny die, on the other hand with all the suspisous characters around, it leaves you to believe he gets wacked, so basicly it ends however you want it to.... (i hope this makes sence)<br /><br />btw, no joke, 2 seasons ago, i was driving down 21st street and Ditmars, i stop at the red light, i look over and see TOny in the truck , then i noticed the camera attached to the hood, it was preety cool and low key

				I disagree. I don&#039;t think the creators/directors/writiers gave a s___ that the people might not want to see Tony die. THis is a little too sensitive given the vein of the show overall. But I dig the debate.

				Tony got whacked and now sleeps with the fishes. <br />the entire episode played like his farewell. he wakes up in a bed, lying down (foreshadowing his death?) and then every scene thereafter has some sort of personal resolution for him...he sees Junior...has dinner with Meadow...sees Sil in the hospital...has Phil whacked/smooshed....gives Paulie the capo job...but lets face it, Tony ran out of friends and time. Sil can&#039;t render advice, Bobby and Vito are dead, AJ is on his own path, Meadow on hers, Carm is buying houses, Dr Melfi dumped him, and Junior is crazy (like a fox??)...he calls a truce with Phil&#039;s crew and then KILLS PHIL ANYWAY....at the end we see him with his family - the only people he has left and the only people he CANNOT talk to!...the assassin could have come through the door or come up from behind, but the fact is Tony, who always considered himself &quot;lucky&quot;, finally ran out of luck. It all caught up with him. <br />Cut to black. Silence.&nbsp; <br />Leaving Paulie and the &quot;snake with a tail&quot; in charge at the pork store. <br /><br />BRILLIANT ENDING!

				I&#039;ve heard another idea re: the ending that I like the best. It refers to the Bobby conversation and uses it, but with a twist. My problem with the cutting to black stating that Tony is dead is that they could have easily panned to another family member afterwards. However, if the idea is that everything just goes black after you die, then why can it not be the audience that got whacked? The theory I choose is that Chase killed all us viewers off, basically. We don&#039;t get to see the rest of the story and don&#039;t get to know how it ended. It just went black.

				When I first heard the &quot;audience-got-whacked&quot; concept I was like, how stupid! But it grew on me and now that&#039;s my favorite theory. We were tagging along the whole time, after all. The Sopranos family just kept on living, the mob kept on doing their thing, maybe they got whacked eventually, maybe not- we&#039;ll never know. &#039;cause we were killed off. And none of the characters saw it nor cared.&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				After that last post, it occured to me that it&#039;s even more simple: The series was whacked. Which is as traumatic to us as a viewing audience as it would have been one particular person that we knew as an individual.<br /><br />I like this idea. Sticking to it.

				I like the series-getting-wacked idea also. And I like the open-endedness of it. I don&#039;t like the idea of our view going black because Tony got shot, because we were looking <em>at</em> him and not out from his perspective. So yes, I like that. I&#039;m not sure that&#039;s what David Chase specifically had in mind, but unless he says otherwise this will be my view.
