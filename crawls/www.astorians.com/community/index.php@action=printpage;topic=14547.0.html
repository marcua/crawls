				Man, I used to love my Breakfast Treats dunked into hot morning coffee.&nbsp; But I haven&#039;t had &#039;em for a long while&nbsp; :cry:.&nbsp; And I won&#039;t!&nbsp; Whoa, you say, I see them in the stores all the time!&nbsp; Yeah, those are scab cookies!&nbsp; The firm that bought them out from Kraft in 2006, some entity called Brynwood Partners, locked out the BCTGM Local 50 striking workers and replaced them all with non-union bakers.<br /><br />Just the other day I saw a Stella D&#039;Oro product on the shelf at Jack&#039;s 99 cents.&nbsp; Proof fewer people are buying them in the full-price stores.

				I am sorry...but does it really matter who makes the cookie.&nbsp; The products are made based on a recipe..so whether it is a union or non union worker, they should still taste and look the same.&nbsp; I have worked in the food industry for years and I can tell you..sometimes it doesn&#039;t make a difference who is making the item...especially when automation is involved.&nbsp; Honestly, the machines do most of the work.&nbsp; The workers are just filling the machines and sealing up boxes.&nbsp; If the quality is an issue...then they must be using different brands of ingrediants..and that doesn&#039;t matter if a union or non union person is working.

				I disagree with the previous poster and believe in the concept of organized labor.<br />Regardless, I hate those cookies.

				The strike has to do with the company&#039;s intention to cut the union workers pay and benefits. <br /><br />http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/14/nyregion/thecity/14cook.html (http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/14/nyregion/thecity/14cook.html)<br /><br />Would you be okay with it if your employer wanted to cut your pay and benefits? The idea about the quality of the cookies is not really the issue, it;s about whether we are willing to tolerate the busting of unions in order to replace the with cheaper workers.&nbsp;
