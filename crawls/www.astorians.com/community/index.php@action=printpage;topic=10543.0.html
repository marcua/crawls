				Hello<br /><br />Dept of traffic wants to take away all waterfront parking along Vernon Blvd to make a bicycle lane.

The more people that bike to work, or take mass transit, the less congestion there will be for those people who do drive. (And who can afford to pay for parking spots.) There&#039;s no good North-South bike route there that will take you to the bridge, and I&#039;m glad to see that DOT will be putting one in.

				Hello,<br /><br />Many people like to drive to Rainey Park and Socrates Park. They will have to park on inner streets which will produce congestion and strain on residents of the area. The area will have a few more condo buildings and elimination of all that waterfront parking will have a greater impact then the few people interested in biking along the northern terminus of Vernon Blvd. We must value means versus extremes in this case. Is it logical to eliminate all those spots for a few bikers. The residents of the area pay city taxes and should have the ultimate say of their streets<br /><br />Dave

				Here I am, I do sleep sometimes.<br /><br />The link to the pdf for the plan is right here. (http://www.streetsblog.org/wp-content/pdf/vernonblvd.pdf)<br /><br />Parking will be removed along the river side of Vernon Blvd, parking will remain on the eastern side of Vernon.&nbsp; The majority of bldgs currently along the river side are parks or large industrial buildings that often have offsite parking (ConEd, Costco, Keyspan).&nbsp; In exchange for this there will be a bike lane going in both directions with a 5&#039; painted buffer between the bike lane and traffic.&nbsp; It is our hope that once that is done (which should start summer of this year), the DoT can begin to explore raising the money to fund a capital project to make the painted buffer a physical buffer and make the bike lane a proper green way.&nbsp; The parking removal aspect of Vernon will begin at 45th St and end at Main St.&nbsp; The commercial district of Hunters Point will not get a bike lane, rather it will get on street markings and signage alerting cyclists and drivers to be aware of each other as they share the road.&nbsp; At Queensbridge Houses parking will not be removed and a pedestrian relief green street median will be installed to make it easier for residents crossing into the park there.<br /><br />I disagree with the statement that no one bikes along Vernon.&nbsp; Many people do, myself included, to access the parks and to commute to Brooklyn via the Pulaski Bridge.&nbsp; Vernon is also one of the few roads that actually goes continuously past the QBB.&nbsp; A recent survey by the group Green Shores NYC found that 80% of respondents biked or walked to the riverside parks.&nbsp; If you stand along Vernon during commute times during the week or any time during the weekend you will see cyclists using Vernon.<br /><br />Vernon is dangerous to cycle and cross as is b/c it is a local truck route and b/c of some of the blind curves.&nbsp; Other than signal changes a bike lane has been found to slow down traffic by about 10% on a busy road.&nbsp; Additionally, zoning changes are most likely due to come to the waterfront area, to put a bike lane like this in place now, before the changes take place all over, &quot;reprograms the street&quot; to encourage new residents to leave their car behind, or for builders to have more parking offsite.<br /><br />The Transportation Alternatives Queens Committee (http://groups.google.com/group/TAWQ) (you knew I was going to get that link in there somewhere) has been working towards this for over a year.&nbsp; We sent a letter, signed on by 15 community groups, to DoT Commissioner Sadik-Khan, we&#039;ve done outreach at pretty much every event we go to, talking up the river side greenway.&nbsp; We&#039;ve met stay at home mom&#039;s who don&#039;t bike but like the idea of calming traffic and giving cyclists somewhere safe on Vernon that isn&#039;t the sidewalk.&nbsp; We&#039;ve met commuters from Brooklyn who come over the Pulaski to work at locations like the power plants down past Astoria Park.&nbsp; We&#039;ve met families that live in Ravenswood, Queensbridge and Astoria Houses and would like a better connector for their kids to use to get to the parks for all the great events that hold there.<br /><br />Yes parking will be lost, around 250 spots.&nbsp; But DoT is open to create more parking along side streets by changing the regulations.&nbsp; It probably won&#039;t replace all the spots, but it will replace some.&nbsp; And it is being lost for a good cause, by building a useful and safe bike network the City encourages a healthy, cheap and emission free form of travel.&nbsp; Some us may think it&#039;s insane and strange, but our children and grandchildren who grow up with the bike infrastructure won&#039;t think it&#039;s strange, they&#039;ll just think it&#039;s there to be used.&nbsp; This is something that will benefit our City&#039;s population into the future.<br /><br />Finally, I&#039;d like to address to taxes comment.&nbsp; This is often the one that bugs me the most, because I also pay taxes, the same taxes everyone pays.&nbsp; I pay taxes for the QBB and I pay taxes for Vernon and I pay taxes for free parking all throughout the city.&nbsp; And I barely get to use any of these facilities, b/c I don&#039;t own a car.&nbsp; I&#039;d like part of my taxes to go to a bike lane, how about that?&nbsp; While legislators are pushing for a tax rebate for hybrid drivers, I get no rebate for riding my bike and taking mass transit, while the gas tax is being bounced around as something to eliminate for this summer I will get no discount for riding my bike around town.&nbsp; While people cried that $2k a year for congestion pricing is too much to drive, often alone, into the busiest part of the city, I pay $972 a year for a metrocard to cram onto often crowded trains.&nbsp; What do I get back for my taxes, hmmm?&nbsp; More parking and wider roads is not what I want and does not serve me.

				This is great news!&nbsp; I think Heff has summed up the issue very well.&nbsp; As for who bikes down Vernon - my husband commutes to work in Brooklyn daily on his bike and takes Vernon along its entire length - both ways, every single day.&nbsp; It&#039;s a terrible part of his commute and I&#039;m very pleased to see that it will soon be safer.

				The Vernon Bike route is great!&nbsp; I&#039;m very happy that the DOT is doing this and I can&#039;t wait to ride my bike along the shore and have lunch down in LIC!<br /><br />I think that those people who are worried about the impact of losing some parking spots will be pleasantly surprised that the actual effect will be the reverse!&nbsp; Since more people will feel comfortable biking to the park, less will use their cars, and more spaces will actually open up.<br /><br />This bike route is going to stimulate business along Vernon and is going to force the people who move into those new condos to use mass transit, to walk or to bike (since there is no where for them to park their cars.&nbsp; Bike lanes have also been shown to slow down traffic by 10%, making it friendlier for people to cross streets and enter parks.<br /><br />Folks, we cannot pave over our neighborhoods and parks and neglect all other uses of our streets in pursuit of ever more places to park our cars.&nbsp; This bike lane is a great benefit to those who want to live a car free life, and free America from petro-dictators, and free themselves from $4/gallon gas.&nbsp; Thanks DOT!

				Hello.&nbsp; I&#039;m a tax paying, car owning resident who lives near Astoria Park.&nbsp; I run at the track every morning, and commute to work and elsewhere by driving more often than not, but I have to say that I am really excited by this plan to create a&nbsp; bike lane on Vernon Blvd.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve been trying to ride my bike more to work and to get around, because these gas prices are just ridiculous (projected to be $7 a gallon by the end of the summer!) and I need the exercise. I&#039;ll ride down Vernon Blvd to LIC to run errands or see friends and the cars and trucks really speed by and whip around those curves!&nbsp; Having a buffered bike lane define space for cyclists and offer some protection.<br /><br />Usually someone has to die to prove a point in order for things to change.&nbsp; I&#039;m glad that DOT is being proactive and that hopefully we will get to see this stretch of bike lanes built on Vernon Blvd without a tragic event having to happen first.

				The signs are not just on the walls but at the pump. Time to switch to human powered vehicles. And if it&#039;s DOT spearheading this change on Vernon Blvd., well, about time they got their smarts. I say DOT sees the future. They are into building highways, streets, roads or what have you to accommodate traffic and make it flow. Well, they are just preparing for the coming advent (it&#039;s almost here) of more bicycles on the road. I&#039;m happy to see the end of &quot;Build longer, wider and straighter roads, and bigger, heavier and more gas-guzzling V8&#039;s and SUVs&quot; mentality. Traffic calming is what we need. Making room for bicycles is the right thing to do to encourage more cycling and lessen our dependence on foreign oil that causes unjustified and costly wars. Besides, who says no cyclists use Vernon Blvd.? Duh?! Most people who go to the parks on the Queens waterfronts use bicycles or go by foot. This has already been proven by a recent Dept. of Parks survey. Duh!<br /><br />Emmanuel<br />from L.I.C. 11101

				Waterfront parking? Why did this exist in the first place? We should be so lucky as to be one of the few Queens neighborhoods that has access to the water. I for one am incredibly grateful that someone has finally taken the sensible move to use the waterfront for something more healthy, fun, and entertaining than car storage.

				Having a bike lane that is part time parking and part time a bike lane be confusing for everyone.&nbsp; And having the bike lane temporarily break off only at the Costco site would make one of the more dangerous intersections along Vernon remain dangerous only to save maybe 10 parking spots tops. <br /><br />Plus Costco isn&#039;t going to be there forever, the owner of the actual land the Costco is on (which is not owned by Costco) is already entertaining the idea of selling to residential builders once their lease is up.&nbsp; And&nbsp; no matter how busy they may seem, Costco isn&#039;t making the money it needs to for such a high profile spot (wedged between two popular parks on the waterfront).&nbsp; Seems most NY&#039;ers don&#039;t have the apartment space to buy more than a few non-perishable bulk items from the store, most of us don;t have garages or pantries to store boxes of mustard or crackers.&nbsp; This bike lane will probably be around longer than Costco.

				Not for a while, about 10 years.&nbsp; Still I think Costco just isn&#039;t a really good fit for the neighborhood, my parents shop at Costco back home, and you need a certain amount of space to store their goods.&nbsp; People have talked about it on the board here before, its popular locally at least to get a case of tp or one or two other items that people use a lot of, but I don&#039;t think a lot of people are doing the bulk of their shopping there, and thats what Costco really needs to pay the rent.&nbsp; And I&#039;ve heard from reps at certain parks that while Costco was initially very giving of water and food and stuff for events, in the last few years they haven&#039;t been giving out anything, which could mean they don&#039;t have strong intentions to remain neighbors forever.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m not against Costco by the way, as far as I know they treat their employees well and the discounts come from buying in bulk, not bullying their vendors (as far as I know), I just don&#039;t think the edge of Western Queens is a good fit for them.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know a lot of people that shop from them regularly or at all.

				Thanks.&nbsp; I&#039;m actually a member, and several of my friends are as well -- all of us here in Astoria.&nbsp; It certainly can be a challenge to find room for some of the bulk items, but I split a membership with a family member, and we often split packages as well.<br /><br />I don&#039;t usually see the area around Costco jam-packed with street parking, even when the parking lot is full or nearly so.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think there will be a huge effect on the parking lot from eliminating those few spots, either.

				I&#039;m not speaking to anyone specific here but I really have to speak to this bike issue a bit.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s great that people ride bikes for pleasure and even for commuting.&nbsp; But I think this automatic and overwhelming support for all things bike related is very unfair and misguided.&nbsp; Personally, I&#039;ve had more than a couple of very unpleasant run ins with bikes/bikers.&nbsp; Literrally.&nbsp; Bikes can actually reach a pretty high speed and it&#039;s no fun for a pedestrian to be hit by one.&nbsp; And it happens A LOT.&nbsp; There are a lot of bikers out there who think because they&#039;re doing this amazingly green thing, that they&#039;re entitled to race down the streets and sidewalks as they please.&nbsp; They run red lights rampantly and then yell and whistle as they&#039;re blowing through intersections filled with people who have the Walk signal.&nbsp; And their disdain of car drivers often leads to aggressively dangerous run ins with cars as well.&nbsp; A law-abiding driver shouldn&#039;t have to slam on breaks because a bike flies in front of them illegally, and worse - deliberately.<br /><br />Hey - I don&#039;t think it&#039;s smart for any Astorian to be driving around in a Hummer.&nbsp; But not all of us can realistically use bikes.&nbsp; I can&#039;t take a bike to my job in the clothes I wear.&nbsp; I can&#039;t take the bike in the rain or snow or 90 degree days.&nbsp; It&#039;s important that I look and smell clean for my job.&nbsp; So I ride the subway (I know - not always clean and pretty smelling either!).&nbsp; I would seriously consider a Vespa but that&#039;s about it.&nbsp; I am also not in my 20s anymore and maybe not in the best shape to be biking over bridges and across boroughs.&nbsp; And you know what?&nbsp; Maybe I just don&#039;t want to.&nbsp; But don&#039;t assume that makes me, and everyone like me, to be these horrible people who just use up gallons and gallons of unnecessary fuel.&nbsp; <br /><br />I guess I&#039;m trying to say that it&#039;s not fair to think you know both sides.&nbsp; Because maybe there are aspects not being considered.&nbsp; So I don&#039;t believe that the entire stretch of Vernon should be changed in this way 24/7/365.&nbsp; I think maybe during rush hours, like HOV lanes, makes sense.&nbsp; But all the time?&nbsp; And over the weekend when we have company visiting who need to park - then no.&nbsp; It&#039;s like anything else.&nbsp; No one likes any group of people imposing their standards on others.&nbsp; I think a rational result will come if some of the more adamant bikers tone it down a notch.

				There are an amazing number of pedestrians who never look out for bikes who are obeying the traffic laws, either.&nbsp; Bikers are surprisingly invisible to both car drivers and pedestrians.&nbsp; If you provide a designated space for bikes on the streets, there will be fewer bikes on sidewalks, where some bikers go because they feel the road is too dangerous because there <em>aren&#039;t</em> designated lanes.&nbsp; Their perceived disdain for car drivers are likely as a result of years of battling car drivers who disdain them -- or who go so far as to target them and terrorize them.&nbsp; I know people this has happened to.&nbsp; Maybe both sides need to calm down, but from what I&#039;ve seen, aggressiveness by bikers stems from their desire to stay alive.&nbsp; There are many cities and countries where bikers and cars drive together harmoniously - the antagonism doesn&#039;t need to be there.&nbsp; But until cars give a little of the road back, it will probably continue.&nbsp; Both bikes and cars are legally allowed to use the roads - they are <em>not</em> exclusively a domain of cars.<br /><br />Of course commuting by bike isn&#039;t for everyone, but why penalise those for whom it is possible by forcing them to ride in the middle of motorized vehicle traffic?&nbsp; As for your job - well, I know several people who commute by bike whose jobs require them to wear ties and smell clean.&nbsp; They seem to have figured out a way to make it work.&nbsp; They aren&#039;t in their 20s, either.<br /><br />For the record, I don&#039;t commute by bike and I don&#039;t intend to.&nbsp; But I fully support safer roads for those who do choose to do so.&nbsp; In the end, bikers, car drivers, and pedestrians will all benefit.

				Well said Lanseaux, there are good and bad pedestrians just like there are good and bad cyclists and drivers.&nbsp; I&#039;m a very cautious and law abiding cyclist, but I still get yelled at sometimes by drivers, and I can&#039;t say why.&nbsp; I can say that if you want to keep all cyclists in the fringe culture that TJT described, the best way to do that is to not make biking accessible and safe for everyone.&nbsp; I hate the cyclists who ride on sidewalk and blow red lights without caution probably more than most because they make my job harder, which is to make cycling accessible to people who just want to get where they are going a little faster than walking.<br /><br />TJT you&#039;re saying we should take a look at all sides and make a compromise, but if you were to do the same you might see that cyclists are already making a compromise and have been for a very long time.&nbsp; We&#039;re talking about removing parking on one side of one road, and not even the whole road, the parking removal and bike lane ends at 45th in Hunters Point.&nbsp; Cars still have the run of the majority of the public space in NYC.&nbsp; Bike lanes, particularly in Queens, are still scarce and often ignored and poorly enforced.&nbsp; Like I said earlier, I pay the same taxes on the city roads that everyone else pays, all I want is a little space on some of the roads.&nbsp; I would call that a fair compromise.&nbsp; <br />

				I think we need to stop categorizing and demonizing each other as &quot;drivers&quot; or &quot;bicyclists&quot; or &quot;pedestrians&quot;. &nbsp;We&#039;re neighbors, and we all need to work with each other, with respect and understanding to achieve a better Astoria. &nbsp;I&#039;m sorry if my earlier comments made you feel like I was demonizing you TJT. &nbsp;I think a lot of people feel the way you do. &nbsp;I understand your objections, but I think the bile lane is a good thing.<br /><br />I walk/bus/subway 99% of the time. &nbsp;I only ride my bike recreationally on weekends. &nbsp;I don&#039;t think I qualify as a &quot;hard core&quot; cyclist.<br /><br />I think one of the reasons why drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians get on each other&#039;s nerves is due to the fact that the street doesn&#039;t assign cyclists a given space. &nbsp;As a driver I admit I get startled and annoyed when I suddenly look in my right hand mirror and I see some guy on a bike, 12 inches from my car, going at 20 mph! &nbsp;Legally, he has a right to be there, but my mind set is that the streets are for cars and there was nothing warning me to look out for this guy. &nbsp;Likewise, when I&#039;m riding my bike, even if I&#039;m hugging the parked cars (which is dangerous to me due to doors flying open!) there are still some drivers who buzz way too close to me on purpose to show me whose boss! &nbsp;It happens a lot. &nbsp;And as a pedestrian I&#039;m sick and tired of getting harassed at corners by both drivers and bicyclists (but more often drivers to tell you the truth, Livery car drivers).<br /><br />Bike lanes do a great deal to solve these problems. &nbsp;It lets me know, as a driver, that there are bikes around here and that I&#039;m supposed to share the road, it also lets me know how much space to give them. &nbsp;I know exactly where they are going to be. &nbsp;As a pedestrian it lets me know when I&#039;m jaywalking or in the cross walk that I should look out for bikes too! &nbsp;I think bike lanes let everyone know where everyone else should be and they reduce the stress on drivers, cyclists and pedestrians alike. &nbsp;Right now, its a free for all. &nbsp;So quite frankly, I think that all of this aggravation is due mostly to a street design which leaves a prominent mode of transportation without a defined space. &nbsp;They don&#039;t have these problems in Europe, because European cities define seperate lanes and even streets, just for bicyclists.<br /><br />Finally, I don&#039;t think asking for one street to be dedicated full time for cyclists is such a sacrifice. &nbsp;All of the roads in Astoria are dedicated to cars 100% of the time. &nbsp;All of the curb space in Astoria is dedicated to car parking. &nbsp;Asking for one side of one road is not an unreasonable sacrifice, its not even a compromise, it is a crumb off of the table, a token gesture. &nbsp;Cars still have 99.9% of the curbside street space for parking. &nbsp;Is it too much to ask that 0.1% of the curb NOT be dedicated to cars? &nbsp;<br /><br />I don&#039;t think its the cyclists who are being unreasonable here.

That being said I wish to address what you said in the first part. Actually defensive driving is more than just &quot;being aware of the other side of your vehicle&quot;. It is being aware of what happening 15 seconds AHEAD of you, behind you, to the left and to right of you. So let me understand what you&#039;re saying. You&#039;re saying that just because there is a bike lane, people forget to check ahead or to their sides? I drive in this neighborhood and let tell you something, people don&#039;t check even when they&#039;re driving down 21st Street with two lanes of traffic!! <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;To address your second point. Again, it is going to sound familiar, you&#039;re saying that the bike lane should be placed on some side streets, let&#039;s say 14th street for example, which doesn&#039;t work, since that ends at Broadway. Ok, how about 21st Street!? Even though Vernon Blvd has its own dangerous intersections, I would never in my life even suggest to bicyclist to try and venture down 21st Street on a bike. It&#039;s like committing suicide! You say it will take away &quot;much needed parking&quot;. Well, look at it this way, if people KNOW IN ADVANCE that there won&#039;t be parking or a limited number of spots available do you think they will come to look for spots?&nbsp; <br />Plus, some on here say &quot; I hardly see people biking down Vernon&quot; or &quot;it isn&#039;t fair to take away parking for a few bikers&quot; &quot; or I could never bike to work in a suit and tie&quot;. Well let me tell you something, in cities like Copenhagen, Amsterdam, Berlin, London, Oslo and countless other cities in Europe, there are plenty of people who bike to work in suit and tie. <br /><br />&nbsp;So I guess I am a &quot;pedestrian-driver-public transport user-bicyclist&quot;. <br /><br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk6YxhKH590 (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk6YxhKH590)

				By stating that you would rather see it turned into a one way street instead etc etc etc, doesn&#039;t actually produce the same results that the DOT is proposing. What the DOT is proposing, is to have a BUFFERED bike lane, meaning that it is PROTECTED, not just running parallel with the traffic, but there will be a gap between the bike lane and the traffic lane. Eventually, TransAlt Queens, hopes to have an actually physical barrier, like such that exists in some foreign cities such as Amsterdam and Berlin. If the street were to be turned into a one way street (and I don&#039;t see that happening anytime in the near future) it will still happen the same way- buffered bike lane etc. Plus, you propose something which is not viable, such as using &quot;other streets&quot;. So which streets exactly? Is it going to be in a zigzag sort of pattern? What about all those people who use Vernon Blvd. to get to the Pulaski Bridge or to the 59th via an alternate route ( cause biking down Crescent St. just doesn&#039;t cut it)? <br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=10543.msg129543.html#msg129543">Quote from: rnrollgirl on May 22, 2008, 06:39:45 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">i am only taking about one little stretch of vernon blvd...the area around costco, that japanese art musueum, socrates sculpture park, rainy park, etc.&nbsp; i can&#039;t give a specific route, as i don&#039;t know all of the back and smaller streets in that area, but if this part of vernon blvd. is so important to the bike path plan, i would rather see it turned into a one way street instead.&nbsp; that way, you can keep parking on both sides of the street, put a bike lane in, and keep car traffic moving.&nbsp; on a busy weekend, that area can get pretty hectic with all of the people going to the museum, parks and shopping at costco.&nbsp; traffic is backed up on vernon going into the costco parking lot and as mentioned before, there are people parking in that lot to go to socrates park (so parking is a premium as it is already).<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Actually I&nbsp; am at Socrates quite often on the weekends and yes I see plenty of people who park at the Costco parking lot who shouldn&#039;t be.

And I can count just as many bicycles as cars, usually more, going both ways on Vernon. That intersection is THE blind corner. If traffic were forced to slow down, and I&#039;ve been beeped at many times, in my car, from drivers behind me who thought that I was going too slow! I didn&#039;t know that the speed limit on Vernon Blvd. was 50!!! 30 on local roads!! <br />&nbsp; So, basically, you&#039;re saying, that bicyclists should turnd onto Broadway, go up one of the side streets, let&#039;s say 12th, then go down till 36th Ave, and come back onto Vernon just because of one lousy intersection near the Noguchi ( that&#039;s the name BTW), Socrates Sculpture Park, Rainey Park and Costco that causes you to sit in traffic? I&#039;m sorry but that has got to be the most self absorbed&nbsp; comment I have ever seen in three years on the board.

				Ya know, if there were a bike lane on Vernon, I&#039;d probably bike to Costco more often instead of driving (yes, and shlep the stuff back on my bike - it&#039;s quite feasible if you plan properly).&nbsp; I did bike to Costco once -- the battery on our car died and it was the only way we could think of bringing it there.&nbsp; While it was very funny to bike through the streets of Astoria with a car battery strapped to the back of the bike, it would have been much easier if there had been more bike lanes.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=10543.msg129543.html#msg129543">Quote from: rnrollgirl on May 22, 2008, 06:39:45 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">no i agree with you 100%&nbsp; the person who commented previously (the one i quoted) made it sound as if there were a bike lane, it would be their main guideline for driving with a bike down that street.&nbsp; maybe i misinterpreted that, but my response was just reiterating how often some people don&#039;t use bike lanes even when they&#039;re available and that bike lanes aren&#039;t the only way to make sure everyone is safe on the road.&nbsp; in my experience, i am more likely to see a biker not follow the lanes or the rules of the road.&nbsp; so this is one of the reasons i am so wary of the importance of bike lanes. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I don&#039;t think people would follow like sheep and all bikers would use the bike lane.&nbsp; But they certainly won&#039;t use the bike lane if there isn&#039;t one to begin with!&nbsp; Bikers need to be educated about the importance of bike lanes just as other people do, and one of the best ways to do that is to increase the number and visibility of bike lanes.&nbsp; <br /><br />BTW - there are bike lanes on both 35th and 36th Streets - the one on 35th St. is quite new.&nbsp; They are much welcomed and I have used them and see people using them frequently.&nbsp; However, as Jtrane points out, cars often block the bike lane.&nbsp; When that happens, the biker is forced to swerve out into traffic.&nbsp; It would be nice if cars respected the bike lane, too.&nbsp;

				Both. Parking or standing/stopping. The law clearly states that one should park,stand or stop OPPOSITE the bike lane, so that those using the bike lane won&#039;t have to jut out into traffic and fight for their already limited space.

				Hi all,<br /><br />I ride my bike along Vernon Blvd every morning and every afternoon.&nbsp; It is an ideal bike route through Astoria, as the traffic is not too bad and the road is wide.&nbsp; I believe the average driver (definitely the average taxi) chooses 21st Street over Vernon as a pipeline through western Astoria, but I think a lot of bikers use this route because of the parks.<br /><br />A few points:<br /><br />-A good bike line may consolidate a lot of commuter (but not food delivery guy) bike traffic to one street, which is good for everyone on the road.&nbsp; I know I will gladly bike a few minutes longer or a few blocks further to ride in a safe environment, and I&#039;m sure I&#039;m not the only one who wants to feel safe when they bike.<br /><br />-The purpose of plans like these is not necessarily to meet the needs of the majority.&nbsp; Clearly, we have a traffic problem in NYC, and if we&#039;re going to be forward-thinking, we need to pursue plans like these.&nbsp; The easier and safer it is to bike, the more people will choose that mode of transportation.&nbsp; Then the road is clear for those of you for whom biking is not an option.<br /><br />-Garciavision: I read your post and all I see referenced are YOUR needs, not the &quot;needs of the area&quot;.&nbsp; Very weak post, for reasons others have pointed out better than I.&nbsp; That said, THANK YOU to all you motorists who are willing to share the road.&nbsp; Every time you slow down rather than run me off the road, or give me the time to move to the shoulder while you pass, I feel a little better about humanity in general.&nbsp; You have my LOVE!

				As it stands now, this is one of the unfriendliest cities for bicyclists there is.&nbsp; Lack of bike lanes, lack of bike parking to lock up, lack of motorist awareness of bicyclists, etc...<br /><br />As it stands now, there is no sharing of the roads for cars and bikes.&nbsp; Creating bike lanes on 35th and 36th streets is nice, but is really not much more than a token effort, and falls significantly short of the real need to make biking easier, and more importantly safer.&nbsp; Almost every restaurant that delivers uses bicycles.&nbsp; That alone should create a demand for safer bike routs.<br /><br />As a non-driver, who doesn&#039;t actually bike that often, I would really appreciate seeing better enforcement of basic traffic laws, in particular, use of turn signals.&nbsp; I got in a shouting match with a driver last weekend when he nearly clipped me because he didn&#039;t use a turn signal, and I was on his right at 21st Street and 23rd Ave.&nbsp; If there was a bike lane on either of those streets, maybe the driver would have taken time to see if there was a rider by him, and perhaps he would have used a turn signal.<br /><br />The more bike riders, the safer it is to ride.&nbsp; But for there to be more bicyclists, more bike lanes need to be created.<br /><br />And I also like the idea of fewer cars on the road.&nbsp; Less pollution, easier for the vast majority of pedestrians and bike riders, easier for buses, etc...

				Hello<br /><br />I ride my bicycle along the 2 mile route Vernon Blvd often and prefer to ride on the waterfront sidewalk since it is continuous with no interupting streets. It takes me around 8 minutes coasting pace not worrying about the traffic. Even if a bike lane is made I will stay on the sidewalk. Few people walk on this isolated sidewalk so it is a smooth ride along waterfront. This should be the greenway instead of spending so much time and money on redoing the road.

				Frankly, I&#039;d like to see bike lanes on all streets where the preponderance of homes are one-family and they all have garages.

				Nice to see all the thoughtful pro-bike sentiment. I ride down Vernon all the time to go between Astoria and Brooklyn, and I think this sounds like a great idea. It&#039;s the most efficient route to the Pulaski bridge, and this could make it a much more pleasant and appealing ride.

				Actually, wearing a helmet is only mandatory if you are 14 and under, however it is usually recommended to wear one regardless. The people who ride on sidewalks are ignorant to the laws of bikers and should be educated, and the same goes for those who ride against traffic. The problem in American society and especially NYC is that for decades bicycles were viewed as not a mode of transportation like the Europeans do, but rather as a way to exercise, for kids to play on/with/around; meaning a toy, and for delivery of foods from restaurants etc. Now all of a sudden that gas has become so expensive, almost prohibitively so, people are looking for alternate ways of commuting and just plain getting around. I don&#039;t know where in Astoria you live that all you see are delivery guys on bikes, but let me assure you that there are plenty of others who bike. Like the guy I saw today, who unfortunately was on the sidewalk, but I gave him a quick education on bike laws, and he thanked me and he said &quot; I didn&#039;t know that I could get a ticket for it. No one ever told me&quot;. Not everyone is so nice though. <br />&nbsp; Creating a bike friendly city doesn&#039;t also mean making it greener, it sometimes means changing traffic regulations that may or may not have been in existence for decades. And it&#039;s going to suck for a while and not everyone will agree with it. But, in the long run, you will see how effective it will be to make our city more beautiful and accessible to pedestrians, bicyclists, and yes even drivers.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=10543.msg130954#msg130954">Quote from: rnrollgirl on May 31, 2008, 04:56:36 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&nbsp; if there&#039;s going to be more biker safety and respect for the other, it has to come from both sides.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes of course it has to go both ways, but at least you can be a little more open to the thought itself.

Like Jennifer said, go earlier and think of others besides yourself. America is one of the only societies in the world that is so car driven and that everything that they do revolves around their automobiles. You can blame Henry Ford for that one. It&#039;s time for a change. <br /><br />p.s. - please don&#039;t take offense at anything I have said here, rnrollgirl.

I have been a Looooong time user of a Metro Card....and still do....and now I&#039;m paying $81 a month for the pleasure....with no bonus or breaks for buying an unlimited monthly...which is insane.<br /><br />So now I have to pay attention to the alternate side of the street parking....hope my car isn&#039;t vandalized, stolen or damaged...and dread the winter snow ins...and shovel outs.<br /><br />I last had a car in 2002.....I swear there is less parking now. It&#039;s an extra expense and stress factor...but I have family upstate and friends out on the Island....mass transit sometimes just wasn&#039;t feasible.

				I just rode down the length of Vernon this Saturday and there was not a single car parked on the west side of the street for at least one mile, from the Queensboro Bridge to the northern end of Vernon.&nbsp; I wish I had a camera on me so that I could post what I saw so that the people who are afraid of losing parking could see that parking does not seem to be a problem in that area.&nbsp; It seems to me that people in that area just do not like parking on Vernon for whatever reason.&nbsp; Maybe its too far away from their homes, who knows, but it really was revealing to see how little the curbside parking was used.&nbsp; I think the bike lane would inconvenience relatively few drivers and provide safety to hundreds of bike commuters and recreational cyclists.

				I saw it!!! They&#039;ve started painting it!!!<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry, but a bike lane on Vernon makes me VERY happy!!! I&#039;ve been biking that route for about three years and seeing the traffic keep getting worse, with more trucks and construction vehicles all the time. It will be nice to have a buffered lane where I am not constantly running the risk of getting hit or honked at (why do drivers insist on honking at bikers... unless you are driving a Prius on electric, chances are I know you&#039;re there!).<br /><br />Now if we could only get the drivers to understand that a bike lane is not just additional parking...

So I stop, get off the bike, put it on the kickstand, walk over to her window, and say- &quot; oh you did know that this is a BIKE LANE?&quot; So she says, and I quote: &quot; I don&#039;t give a s___ what it is, you&#039;re in my effing way!&quot; I took down her license number and took a pic with my cell phone. She didn&#039;t like that too much, and told me she was going to sic her hubby on me.

				The parking has not been elminated at the Nothern end Vernon Blvd in front of the Astoria Houses projects. Also, not eliminated by Queensbridge Houses projects.

				Altho I&#039;m a driver, I support this and was happy to sign the petition for it. The area by the Housing projects is not part of it, is my understanding. I saw it and was happy.

Ever seen a car commercial on television? &quot; it has a 258 horsepower engine, goes 0-60 in 6 seconds etc etc&quot; Nothing is mentioned about mileage, and if it is they espouse the fact that it gets 30mpg as if it were the greatest thing on Earth. What a joke! And it just goes to show that the automakers still control the politicians, just like they did when Henry Ford was alive. Maybe it&#039;s about time people gave up on using their cars for every little errand. Maybe they&#039;ll see the road a little differently, who knows?

				I&#039;m confused by something.&nbsp; I understand bikers liking the new bike lane.&nbsp; It&#039;s cool and it serves bikers without creating havoc to drivers.&nbsp; (Though I&#039;m worried that a lot of drivers have no idea what it means and the laws surrounding it - but that&#039;s another story)&nbsp; What gets me is that a lot of people here are for green initiatives - and so have put their support behind the bike lane thing.&nbsp; That&#039;s fine.&nbsp; But how come both car owners and bikers don&#039;t rally together for new and improved forms of mass transit???<br /><br />I am definitely in the camp of people who would bike for exercise and pleasure.&nbsp; But you will never, ever get me to peddle myself back and forth from my office.&nbsp; Never.&nbsp; Nor would I use my car or any other car.&nbsp; Call me crazy but I want something to move me from point A to point B.&nbsp; I want shelter from rain, sleet, snow, heat, humidity, etc.&nbsp; - you get it.&nbsp; And since our roads are still dominated by the car for the near future, I want to arrive alive.&nbsp; And I don&#039;t want to use my arms or legs.&nbsp; I want to be able to read, unwind, look out the window and daydream.&nbsp; After the pressures of my day, there is no way I can safely negotiate roads on a bike between midtown and Astoria.&nbsp; Bike lane or not.&nbsp; And I just don&#039;t want to and make no apologies.<br /><br />So how come we can&#039;t rally for a light rail line that goes up and down Vernon?&nbsp; Or maybe 21st Street?&nbsp; That would relieve stress from the N/W line and would better serve people living closer to the waterfront - which is being increasingly developed.&nbsp; The bus lines don&#039;t cut it.&nbsp; There needs to be something closer to the subway&#039;s reliability but that serves other parts of Astoria.&nbsp; We live on a river for goodness sake!&nbsp; Why can&#039;t we scream bloody murder for more NY Watertaxi docks?&nbsp; <br /><br />I just think that if you honestly believe that you&#039;re going to convince a large group of people to use a bike as an alternative - well you&#039;re being totally unrealistic.&nbsp; But sensible options will garner support from everyone.&nbsp;

				I don&#039;t think anyone is saying you should be deprived of the option of driving a car. At least, I would never propose banning cars altogether. But as it stands right now, our government spends a lot of money creating roads and free parking spaces in order to facilitate one transportation option (private cars) compared to very little that is spent on other options--which includes bikes but more importantly, and here I agree with TJT, better mass transit. That&#039;s where the disagreements come from, and that&#039;s why this debate can&#039;t be ended by just saying &quot;everyone should use whatever mode of transportation suits their personal preference&quot;. Some people, like me, would prefer that our tax dollars go to subsidize mass transit and bikes, while you apparently believe that we should primarily subsidize drivers. You are, of course, entitled to your opinion, but we can&#039;t both get what we want!

Pretty much any city developed or settled within the past 100 years is a total quagmire from this standpoint. The planning just wasn&#039;t there. It is going to take a long time to turn this around but with the price of oil(gas) as a nation we are going to see renewed urbanism and hopefully smart (re)development.

				I never said give up your car completely, or not to use mass transit. But to use your car to go from your house to a shop five minutes away, when you could bike or *gasp* even walk to it, has never made sense to me, and I grew up in the suburbs of NYC where walking was, and still is to an extent, looked upon as strange, to say the least. So when living in the 5 boroughs I find it strange that people need to get into their car ( like one of my neighbors does) and drive literally 6 blocks to go a place like Top Tomato, drive around looking for a parking space, and then drive home. By all means use your car, but for short trips inside the confines of the 5 boroughs, it makes less and less sense to use a car. Unless you&#039;re disabled and have a specific need for it. Rnrollgirl, I &quot;singled you out&quot;, not out of sarcasm, but because you said yourself that there is no way that you would ever give up your car. So I put you in the same boat as all the others who are unwilling to see the big picture. Have you ever tried to do without your car for a day or two? Yes, I have a car, but I drive it less than 20 miles a week. <br /><br />TJT, you spoke about proposing something like a light-rail system on Vernon Blvd or somewhere else. Do you realize how long the politicians would take for that to come to fruition? I know, I know, you&nbsp; don&#039;t know till you try. So try.

What about the rest of us little folk who don&#039;t live in condos? Parking and bike lanes and traffic lanes cannot co-exist obviously on Vernon Blvd, that&#039;s why this was implemented, get it through your thick skull. Jeez. I have a car and I park on the street, and sometimes it is a struggle to find a space but that&#039;s a part of daily life in NYC. Deal with it. Or give it up. And just because you &quot;dress nice&quot; doesn&#039;t mean you can&#039;t bike to work. Ever been to Amsterdam, or Berlin, or Helsinki, or Oslo, or Copenhagen. In those cities Plenty of business men and women bike to work in their work clothes. Why fight the bike lanes anyway. This is probably the only place in the world where people are fighting to have traffic and parking restored from bike lanes. Pathetic is what I say. &quot;ooh my car, I can&#039;t find parking&quot;&nbsp; Go here for tips on biking to work. You don&#039;t have to bike in your suit you know, you can change when you get to work. Or do you work in one of those types of place where they judge you by how you show up to work? I knew a guy who used to work for Bear Stearns for 10 years and he biked to work pretty much every day, except when it was snowing and then he took the subway, and he was coming from Midwood!! And this was before NYC had bike lanes, in the early 80&#039;s to early 90&#039;s. He would bike in biking gear, and he would leave his suit the evening before at a dry cleaners nearby.&nbsp; Then in the morning he would pick it up and put it on after he got to the office. So if a top commodities trader can do it, so can you. He stopped doing it because he retired. But he still bikes. With his grandkids.<br /><br />You petition isn&#039;t going to work because of all the work to do it in the first place. Why don&#039;t you petition to have shuttle run from Astoria/Lic to Manhattan, separate from the subway or a light rail system. I just think it is a waste of time what you are doing. Instead of trying to undo what&#039;s been done and it is for a great purpose.Why should cars always be the ones that get preferential treatment?

				I am not the one who started the petition but am in support to bring back the parking. I have seen many places which has the bike lanes and the parking has not been removed. notice that the parking was not removed on Vernon Blvd by Queensbridge Houses. Another idea is to allow the parking when people come home in the evening and few bikes are on the road. This way the parking is utilized until the morning when people go to work. There are more building and residents moving in and the parking is highly needed

				I&#039;m a driver, but frustrated with the parking and the pollution, so I invested in a vespa....which I LOVE and can park anywhere, take into work in the city, where Vespas are everywhere. In Europe, scooters, motorbikes and vespas are a way of life as gas prices have been incredibly high for quite some time...i&#039;m curious if the vespa will pass the trendiness and become a way of life here as well. <br /><br />They take about 2-3 bucks a week on gas (if used every day), and i get to work (Hunter College) faster than if I took the train or my car. My hair gets a little windblown, but I freshen up before going into my office or teaching...i get no sweatier than if I was on a stinky subway, and even get on in a skirt and heels..highly recommend it. <br /><br />I had heard talk of a scooter lane in the city, but not sure where I heard that from.

				Excuse me, but doesn&#039;t that condo building have underground parking? This is actually a rhetorical question since I once went to an open house on a whim and I was told and shown the underground parking garage. If you can park indoors, why the heck would you need street parking? And according to that poorly composed petition, it seems that you not only against the bike lane itself, but the whole entire Queens West Greenway proposal! Half of those &quot;signatures&quot; are doubles, meaning people signed twice. And BTW Garciavision ( who doesn&#039;t seem to have any vision actually) every new condo building that is built in the 5 boroughs has to have underground parking. As far as LIC condo buildings, I don&#039;t know when the last time you were down where the Rockrose buildings are, but at last count there were 8(eight)) parking garages for all the residents of those buildings. Each one being a minimum of 4 stories and maximum of 8 stories.

				Since we live in a democratic society, the needs of the majority will prevail. As the area develops, the residents will complain and want change.

				I totally agree. TJT you speak about your 85 yr old father. Well maybe it&#039;s either time he, and others like him, learned what a freaking bike lane is, or they stopped driving altogether. But that&#039;s entirely another subject. It is not impossible to ride a bike and have packages on them. TJT you yourself mentioned being in many of the cities mentioned. Well whilst there didn&#039;t you happen to notice many people speaking on their cellphones, having packages on the rear or even front baskets, or even those lovely and useful cargo bikes with kids and even passengers in them? The Dutch and the Finnish and the Swedes make very good use of their bicycles in ways most Americans can only dare to imagine. Ikea in The Netherlands has a pilot program where you get &quot;loaned&quot; a bicycle with a trailer so that you can take it home without having to rent a van or a car with a trailer. It seems that 20% of their customers there BIKE to Ikea and they thought it would be a great idea. Usually it is people who live 20km or less from Ikea, but there have been stories of people biking 50km. Yes, just to buy a piece of furniture or a lamp.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=10543.msg139825#msg139825">Quote from: Garciavision on July 14, 2008, 04:10:13 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Since we live in a democratic society, the needs of the majority will prevail. As the area develops, the residents will complain and want change. I also notice visitors to Socrates and Rainey parks do not have easy parking anymore. We do not live in a dictatorship where a few people want to eliminate the parking for the masses<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hey garcianonvision, I hate to repeat myself but here goes. The bike lane on Vernon Blvd&nbsp; has been in the planning stages since 1997. NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t just foisted upon us by the DOT, mind you, but it took a lot of work by a lot of people, not &quot;a few people&quot;. Plus it is a part of the greater vision for Western Queens. Do you want just cars, cars, cars, trucks, pollution? Or do you want a healthier, safer place for your kids ( or your friends kids) to live in the future? It looks like you want the same old same old crap that American society has been pushed to believe. So again, check your facts before sticking your foot so far into your mouth that it sticks out of your ass.

				It just goes to show that people become so fanatic about a topic that there is a lost of respect toward one another. There is no need to insult or use foul language. One can state their opinions without becoming militant in the matter. At no time have I directed an insulting comment toward anyone. Next we will have protestors with banners on Vernon Blvd yelling out insults. This demonstrates the quality of the people who support the bike lanes

				I&#039;m all for more bike lanes and have no problems with the initiative. &nbsp;I see using bikes as an alternate form of transporting groceries and furniture as only useful to physically fit people without families who are only shopping for themselves and one other person. &nbsp;There will be plenty of those people who will use these bike lanes and that is great. &nbsp;Loading 10 bags of groceries or furniture on a bike isn&#039;t happening for the majority of folks with families, or the elderly. &nbsp;And thank goodness I don&#039;t have to wear a suit to work. &nbsp;I&#039;d need a good shower after riding my bike commuting to work to Manhattan everyday, and my coworkers would not appreciate my smelliness. &nbsp;But I&#039;m sure there are plenty of people who will use the bike lane and for them this is a great option, and I&#039;m all for it. &nbsp;
