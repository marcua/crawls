			Hi all,<br />I&#039;m a New York Times reporter and (Astoria resident) looking to chat with homeowners in Astoria (including single-family and apartments). When did you buy? Did the search take forever? How are the local brokers? <br /><br /><br />I&#039;m writing from experience - I bought a house in Astoria a couple years ago, and it felt like I won the lottery. Very few listings and they always seemed to be under contract by the time I arrived. Maybe you had a different experience. In any case, I&#039;d love to chat. <br /><br /><br />I&#039;m also looking to speak with folks who are currently trying to buy in Astoria.<br /><br /><br />You can reach me at stefanos (dot) chen (at) nytimes (dot) com. Hope to hear from you!
