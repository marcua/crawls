				<br /><br /><br />I was very disappointed to witness today, a massive stately tree chopped down to the ground.&nbsp; I could clearly observe the tree from my 3rd floor balcony, and never say anything to suggest a tree that was decaying.&nbsp; Many large birds would fly onto that tree on a daily basis.&nbsp; It would turn a very pretty yellow in the Fall.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />And now the entire tree is Gone.&nbsp; The life that tree gave us is gone.&nbsp; No more home for the birds.&nbsp; No more protection from the sun.&nbsp; No providing us with much needed oxygen.&nbsp; Now more beautiful yellow leaves in the fall.&nbsp; Now, when I look out my window...instead of seeing a huge pretty tree...I see a big HOLE.&nbsp; And beyond that?&nbsp; Well now I have a perfect view of...the CON EDISON PLANT.&nbsp; How lovely!<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m curious if anyone knows why this tree may have been cut down??&nbsp; Was there indeed a grave problem with the tree roots, or is it possible that the person who lives there simply decided the tree was an &#039;inconvenience&#039;...maybe they don&#039;t like leaves?...maybe they want to dig up their entire yard and cover it with &#039;pretty cement&#039;??&nbsp; (I do know that for some reason, there are many NYers who don&#039;t like trees...the prefer to see cement everywhere...they think it&#039;s &#039;cleaner&#039;...&#039;neater&#039; looking...&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard many a person express their dislike for &#039;leaves&#039;.&nbsp; Etc.&nbsp; So this is why I&#039;m suspicious as to their motives.)<br /><br /><br />The house is on 41st Street... a red house that is two houses in from 20th Road.

				<br />Greetings yippee <br /><br />&nbsp;:angry: that pisses me off, yippee.&nbsp; While I am not exactly familiar with that area, chopping down a perfectly healthy tree makes no sense at all.&nbsp; Not only does it remove carbon dioxide and provide habitat for animals (i.e., birds, squirrels..), we all should know it provides oxygen as well.<br /><br /><br />Trees are like the lungs of our Planet !!&nbsp; I can go on but will not.&nbsp; &nbsp;:smiley: <br /><br /><br />C&#039;iao for now ~ <br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 0.7em;" class="bbc_size">Please be kind to our Planet earth and all its habitats and creatures</span><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				Healthy trees should not be cut down for convenience, and it is illegal to remove or prune a tree without a permit. https://www.nycgovparks.org/services/forestry/illegal-tree-work (https://www.nycgovparks.org/services/forestry/illegal-tree-work)

That could be the reason it was cut down.<br /><br />

				<br /><br /><br />The tree that was cut down was in someone&#039;s back yard.<br /><br /><br />Also...just about a week later.... one Saturday when we had a pretty strong storm...a good sized limb of a tree fell off a tree on Steinway Street....in front of a private home...in the tree pit.&nbsp; The day after the storm, I saw the branch on the sidewalk, and could see the area on the tree from where the limb broke off.&nbsp; The rest of the tree appeared to be in good shape.<br /><br /><br />But I guess as &#039;punishment&#039; to the tree, a few days later.... the entire tree, chopped down to the ground.&nbsp; ;-(
