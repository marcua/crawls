				Just found out that Applebee&#039;s is going into the old Gold&#039;s Gym space across from the Astoria Kaufman 14.&nbsp; It looks like they&#039;ve already gutted out the space and work is progressing pretty quickly.

				Applebee&#039;s is the worst of those sorts of chain restaurants that I&#039;ve experienced. Usually places like TGI Friday&#039;s and Bennigan&#039;s means instant deliciousness (and disgusting unhealthiness of course), but the food there was always dry and just tasted like it was frozen and they put it in a microwave. There was one near my smalltown college, and that was one of the cool places to go up there. TGI Friday&#039;s, Bennigan&#039;s, Ruby Tuesday&#039;s, and Chili&#039;s are all much better as far as those things go. Not that I want any of them to open around here.. well on second thought a Chili&#039;s wouldn&#039;t be so bad given our Tex/Mex options in Astoria.. but anyway, if we had to have one of them Applebee&#039;s would be my last choice.

				I have a fairly high tolerance for chain restaurants... I think growing up here in Astoria, or even in NYC for that matter (especially in a family without a car) chain restaurants were somewhat of a novelty for me. Once I started driving and ventured out of the city, there was a whole world of food I&#039;d never experienced! I remember when I had my first mozzarella stick -- such cheesy goodness! Never before had I tasted such deliciousness... a log of cheese? Battered? And deep fried? Wow. My arteries clog with excitement at just the thought.<br /><br />Chain restaurants are safe food... relatively consistent, you know what to order, nothing is especially bad tasting, though none of it is especially good for you. Of all the chain restaurants, though, Applebees is the one I think sucks the most and has the least vegetarian options. They&#039;re always kind of sticky and dirty. Chili&#039;s, Outback, Olive Garden... all much better -- everything is relative (and yes, I know that Olive Garden is hardly real Italian... but&nbsp; who can pass up the unlimited breadsticks and salad!).

				While not an Applebee&#039;s fan myself, this is an obvious choice and unsurprising -- if you have been to a mall anywhere in the tri-state area (or Times Square AMC Empire 25) in the past (many) years, this is how it works. Full-family entertainment -- movie theater -- parents with kids in tow -- followed up by a big restaurant equipped to deal with that big family and kid-friendly menus. <br /><br />That kind of restaurant is not the authentic, home-cooked low-key in-the-know declicious epicurean expereience most people here on the board are looking for. But that&#039;s the reality of the crowd and economics of Kaufman Astoria and makes sense for the area.

				One minor benefit to Applebee&#039;s, at least compared to similar chain restaurants, is that they have an official Weight Watchers menu - complete with point values, and fat and fiber count..&nbsp; Yes, it&#039;s marketing, but it&#039;s a nice nod to healthier eating.

				There is nothing healthy about Applebees.&nbsp; I don&#039;t care what celebrity chef they have endorsing the food, or what buzzword name they give to new menu items.&nbsp; Make no mistake about it... there is no real cooking that goes on in that place.&nbsp; I&#039;m a research and development chef by profession, and I know the stuff that goes into food at those places, whether it be Applebees, Olive Garden, etc.&nbsp; It is full of gums, starches, and preservatives for the simple reason that they aren&#039;t cooking the food on premises, just &quot;re-heating&quot; it.&nbsp; It&#039;s a total garbage food and it&#039;s disappointing to know that it&#039;ll be infecting our neighborhood.&nbsp; Stick to the places where people actually have a little passion about what they cook

				I think celebrating mediocrity is going to be the downfall of this nation, and I think spending your hard earned dollars at businesses like Applebees is doing just that.&nbsp; Applebees is unhealthy - there is no arguing that - no amount of &quot;calorie lists&quot; is going to change the fact that they perpetuate the myth that quantity is better than quality.&nbsp; There is no reason for an Applebees to exist in this gastronomically wonderful neighborhood.&nbsp; As a consumer I will make sure that I will NEVER give Applebees my business - and if enough of us do that we will make a difference.&nbsp; This is a no-compromise situation.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t need to read PETA pamphlets to form my own opinion - all I have to do is open my eyes and see how giant restaurant conglomerates are destroying the health of this nation with cheap and very CRAPPY food.&nbsp; And every time we shop at a place like Applebees we are saying that that&#039;s OK.<br /><br />It isn&#039;t.

				The strongest, most vibrant neighborhoods are the ones of great diversity.&nbsp; This extends to gastro-entertainment.&nbsp; So let there be the chain restaurants along with the bistros.&nbsp; Both fulfill a different function in the neighborhood and both strengthen the neighborhood.&nbsp; Not every teenager coming from the movies or every multi-rugrat family wants to eat quaint after seeing a flick.&nbsp; They want simple, relatively cheap.&nbsp; Too much of any one thing, including boutiques and eateries, is never a good thing.&nbsp; Give &#039;em the choice to make on their own.<br /><br />And when it comes to health related concerns: <span class="bbc_u">Eating out is almost never a healthy decision as compared to eating at home</span>.&nbsp; This includes the quality of food, additives and the handling and preperation of food (if you eat out, don&#039;t waste your money on purell).&nbsp; If you are at a point that your personal health is dependent upon the quality of fare dished up at restaurants, then it is time to re-evaluate things.<br /><br />And this is coming from someone who would never eat at a place like that.&nbsp;

				First of all, to me, PETA stands for &quot;People Eating Tasty Animals&quot;.&nbsp; I am not some ultra organic barefoot wannabe who makes my own clothes and fights for greenpeace.&nbsp; I&#039;m just letting you know some information from a different perspective.&nbsp; Some people have never been to an Applebees, and that&#039;s great... don&#039;t bother.&nbsp; I know every small mom and pop place isn&#039;t the best either.&nbsp; My point is that at least they&#039;re cooking things.&nbsp; Chain places like Olive Garden and Applebees don&#039;t even put items on plates half the time.&nbsp; That manicotti they serve comes cryovac sealed from the factory ON THE PLATE and they put the entire thing into a steamer.&nbsp; That to me is sad.&nbsp; Also, eating out is totally unhealthy.&nbsp; From zero stars to 5 stars, it&#039;s not good for you.&nbsp; That being said, I love eating out, but the places I go to aren&#039;t loading their cheese filling with Xanthan gum and Ultrasperse.&nbsp; And the meat is actual meat and not mechanically pressed with wheatex or some other soy derivative.&nbsp; Believe me, it might taste like meat, but it&#039;s not.&nbsp; I&#039;ll admit it, when I was poor in college I ate the hell out of some applebees wings and mozzarella sticks.&nbsp; It was great.&nbsp; Knowing what I know now, the chemicals they put in that stuff really gums your system up.&nbsp; I won&#039;t touch it.&nbsp; Make your own mind up.&nbsp; Go there and see if it&#039;s worth it.&nbsp; Just know from a physiological perspective, it&#039;s not good food.

				Ok calm down everyone!&nbsp; I think you all have it wrong.&nbsp; Sure, we can all complain about how bad Applebee&#039;s is, but why not just speak with your business?&nbsp; Instead of going to the chain restaurants, why not support your local restaurants.&nbsp; Go to Cup or the new Italian restaurant that just opened down the block from Cup called Cinema Paradisio I think.&nbsp; It looks really nice, although I have never been (anybody want to organize a field trip?).&nbsp; I think both are a great example of nice, delicious, local restaurants.

				Eat what you want when you want and how much you please. I don&#039;t think their is anything wrong with Sous Vite Manicotti. &quot;That manicotti they serve comes cryovac sealed from the factory ON THE PLATE and they put the entire thing into a steamer. &quot; It is a idiot proof technic that assures the operator consistancy and controll.<br /><br />&nbsp;I never ate at Applebees, yesterday we enjoyed JJS Fusion and today we enjoyed Cafe Triskell. The Dulce de Leche Crepe was Heaven and the Passion Iced tea refreshing and exotic.<br /><br />If anyone ventures to Bayside their is a new Rest. Bar called SALA on 189 and Northern looks great (oldest historic house in Bayside) very promising chef, Peter, from NYC with a deep Passion for grilled seafood opening in like 2 weeks.<br />But in the hood my favorite right now is Triskell.

				Woah, didn&#039;t know Applebee&#039;s evoked such strong feelings in either direction.&nbsp; It rocks, it&#039;s evil, it&#039;s... polarizing, I take it.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Having never been to Applebee&#039;s I wouldn&#039;t know about the food.&nbsp; I tend not to do the chain thing.&nbsp; I like the fancy schmancy foodie places and the unpretentious here&#039;s-your-burger-and-coke places too.&nbsp; Depends on the mood I&#039;m in.&nbsp; Had to laugh when I read the post above about the &quot;passionate&quot; chefs giving you the shits... I love me some foie gras and the like but I&#039;ve paid for it with some gastric distress.&nbsp; The diners in our area haven&#039;t wowed me (haven&#039;t been to Michael&#039;s, though -- that place seems to get good reviews) so if I were to think of something casual and comfy that would be nice to have near the movie theater I&#039;d be thinking a good diner would work for me.&nbsp; Yeah, I know Cup&#039;s a stone&#039;s throw away.&nbsp; I like their decor but the food just, well, meh.&nbsp; And the service has been kind of meh too.&nbsp; One time when I went not only did the waitress not know what an egg done over easy was, neither did the cook.&nbsp; With all the great restaurants in the area I find it hard to want to spend money on something that&#039;s lacking in flavor, whether fancy or casual.<br /><br />I second the vote for bringing good Chinese food to Astoria.&nbsp; <br />

				Well, my point wasn&#039;t really that people should ONLY shop locally.&nbsp; I&#039;m not against shopping at chain stores at all(I do myself sometimes).&nbsp; I&#039;m just saying that in a lot of areas of the country, it would do the community well for people to support local business more than they do.&nbsp; Here, this is not really a problem.&nbsp; Where I am from, it is a problem.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m not a believer in supporting bad service just for the sake of supporting a local business.&nbsp; If a chain has better service, or product, or whatever, then they win.&nbsp; But, in a lot of cases, the local businesses will still lose even if they provide a comparable or better product or service.&nbsp; People are free to do as they choose, but, if I can go to the local hardware store and get something that might cost me 1.00 more than Lowe&#039;s, while still getting service comparable to Lowe&#039;s, I&#039;m going to go to the local store to keep the money in the community.&nbsp; But, hey, I also believe that Bill Gates should help pay for my healthcare, so maybe I&#039;m crazy.&nbsp; <br /><br />It is all relative, and, of course, depends on your financial situation and what you are purchasing.&nbsp; It is a matter of choice and opinion.&nbsp; The Wal-Mart effect really does exist, though, and many times local businesses are completely destroyed by the big chains coming to town, even if the local businesses are just as good, or better.

				I feel like a lot of you are missing the point.<br /><br />Chains aren&#039;t better because they&#039;re cheaper.&nbsp; They&#039;re cheaper because they get HUGE tax breaks from the government and unfair advantages by same in relation to the little guy.&nbsp; They&#039;re cheaper because they can mass produce private label items and make a crapload of money off of you and then use that money to hire corporate attorneys to create a corporate structure that is divisive and beneficial only to the wealthy, upper echelon of management.&nbsp; <br /><br />Yes, we are all &quot;free&quot; to make whatever choice we so desire - BUT:&nbsp; know that when you shop at Walmart you aren&#039;t just getting a cheap lawnmower (or whatever) - you&#039;re supporting a business that doesn&#039;t provide affordable healthcare to the core of its employees (among many other things).&nbsp; And as a ginormous corporation, you know they get the cheapest rates out there - why do they make it so difficult for their employees to obtain healthcare - it doesn&#039;t make sense, unless you understand that huge business isn&#039;t about people, it&#039;s about profits - at any and all cost. <br /><br />I have been a small business owner in this city for nearly 14 years.&nbsp; I have watched neighborhood after neighborhood roll over into the mall setup and I have to say that we are not immune to the corporatization of the rest of this country.&nbsp; <br /><br />I CANNOT stress this enough:&nbsp; every time you shop in a chain store you are saying NO to a mom and pop.&nbsp; It&#039;s that simple.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Chain store culture is a celebration of homoginization and mediocrity - why would you want to be a part of that?

				One of the reasons I like Astoria so much is the fact that there aren&#039;t many chain restaurants, or other big chain cookie-cutter stores for that matter, around.&nbsp; Hell, even in Manhattan, there are tons of options besides the chains that I don&#039;t remember having before I got here.&nbsp; In most cities that have had their growth recently, your mom-and-pop options, seem to me anyway, much more limited.<br /><br />I disagree that some, or even most, people won&#039;t support local businesses for a little extra money.&nbsp; I would hone it down to serious price differences, if anything, and maybe even focus that statement more on retail over food service.&nbsp; I have personally thrown a few more dollars at a local business for something than go to a chain to save a few dollars more than once.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now, if we&#039;re talking $300 compared to $150 for the same item, I&#039;m not an idiot and I&#039;m not going to be that loyal.&nbsp; But, if it&#039;s the difference between getting a pasta plate at the local business compared to the same thing for a couple bucks less at an Applebees/OG/Chili&#039;s/etc., I&#039;d gladly spend the little extra on the local.<br /><br />Just throwing in my .02.&nbsp; I&#039;d be happier without the Applebee&#039;s.&nbsp; If it&#039;s successful, there will be more crap to follow.

				replaying to a few points i want to say<br />1. healthcare- yes walmart doesn&#039;t offer it to their employees and i agree with that.<br />As much as i would love for everyone to have affordable healthcare it is not feasible in this climate. Ask GM and Chrysler what is the biggest reason for them not being profitable and the answer is healthcare. They spend Billions of dollars a year on healthcare, thats with a B.<br />I find it intersting that whenever people bash walmart its always on that point of healthcare, walmart has a business modal it worked for them and they are profitable lets move on.<br />2. of course if the difference is a few bucks i will buy it locally because it makes no sense financially to get in my car drive to a mega store spend half hour to save a dollar when my gas probably cost more.<br />3. I also believe that many young people who live here and work in manhattan do not have a car so driving to a chain store is not an option. shopping locally is all they have anyway.<br />4 Regarding eating at a local restaurant compared to a chain I will always choose local and the reason is selling food is different then selling motor oil, freshness counts. If my local shop has fresh ingredients and they know how to prepare it then i will eat there all the time.<br />Major chains get produce shipped to them from all over the country and I am sure that all of their meats chicken or fish is frozen.

				Ok ok I gotta jump in here.&nbsp; Frankly the REASON I love(d) NYC is because of the LACK of chains.&nbsp; the variety of choices.&nbsp; The people, the personalities.&nbsp; It sort of breaks my heart to hear people get all excited about a Panera Bread in a neighborhood with such a huge concentration of bakeries- there arent that many left in Manhattan anymore--- or people begging for a mexican chain or a Jamba juice with all the great local establishments around.&nbsp; The chains tend to drive up prices in real estate as well- since they can pay more, and can afford to run on a loss in a single location. This also drives out the Mom and pop stores.&nbsp; Happens all the time-there were several places in the east village i would regularly shop for food that are simply no longer there---all gone in the last 5-7 years.&nbsp; don&#039;t you think NYC will simply turn into a Long Island-middle american shopping mall if it continues this way?&nbsp; To me it&#039;s about quality of life.&nbsp; I will ALWAYS pay more for the local guy to look me in the eye and say &quot;thanks&quot; and mean it.&nbsp; The guy making a straight salary at any of the box stores could care less.&nbsp; If you dont buy something, he still gets paid.<br /><br />-I LIKE when I go to the hardware store and the guy says hello and helps me with what I need-advises me that I can spend LESS on an item that will work better-&nbsp; I LIKE buying my bread from a place that is proud of what they make.&nbsp; Sometimes the bread is darker than usual, sometimes it&#039;s saltier or rises differently.&nbsp; I LIKE that--The country is mostly running off of chains, and it does seem that my sentiments are in the minority.&nbsp; I hope we all realize what we have before it&#039;s gone.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sorry about my rant--

				there is no doubt that choosing to buy from big chains hurts the mom and pop stores.<br />Unfortunately those guys are here and they will take over within 5-7 years all the prime real estate in Astoria. The M&amp;P stores will be here but it will be at an off location.<br />Look at steinway st with all the chain stores there, the rent on steinway is already too high for a M&amp;P operation. When a 1500 sq ft store rents for over 14K there is no way a small guy can make a profit. Look at the Gap paying 38K a month and they can afford to close down for 4 months to remodel the store. Steinway has become a number 1 location for banks. BANKS. landlords don&#039;t give a flying F about M&amp;P and it shows in their actions.<br /><br />Now i want to ask a question,<br />all the people here who want to support locally, why is starbucks still here and why are they so busy.<br />I walked into starbucks this Saturday at 1 pm and they ran out of ice.<br />there are plenty of coffee places here but they seem to come and go and starbucks keeps going.<br />As for panera i have been to the 1 at rockville center and the food is awful the service sucks but my young daughters like it so i take them there sometimes. <br />I also expose them to the local food here in Astoria, whenever they come to see me at work we always go to eat lunch or dinner here.<br />I finally got my 12 year old to eat a shish kebob from the guy on the corner of Steinway and 31st on the baby gap side and now she is hooked.

I think a lot of it has to do with consistency -- both with the quality of the food/beverage and to a lesser extent, the service. <br /><br />For example, I was at Cup Diner with some friends Saturday night for dessert. We wanted to sit outside. A waiter came rushing by us and warned us that service outside would be slow. He was really rude about it. The same waiter proceeded to get into a fight with a customer -- and when I say fight, I mean it was about to go to blows -- over how the customer was sitting at his table (he had his chair turned sideways). We ended up sitting inside, the dessert took forever anyway, the waiter barely paid attention to us, and it was an all-around miserable experience. Will I go back? Probably not, since I&#039;ve yet to have a good experience there. <br /><br />Now, had my friends and I gone across the street to Starbucks, we could have gotten a pastry of some sort and coffee and spent less money. No table service, but that would have definitely been better than the rude, slow, short-tempered waiter. With Starbucks, you know what you&#039;re getting. With the local establishments, it&#039;s hit or miss.

				Of course- but is Starbucks the next logical step? There was NO other local place to go? Also it&#039;s like comparing apples and oranges in this case... no service--paper cups--pre packaged pastry etc.&nbsp; As opposed to weird twilight zone service at Cup.&nbsp; &nbsp;But, point taken. Starbucks has it&#039;s place-&nbsp; I for one just want to always have the choice to go for one (international chain with the same things I can get ANYWHERE-from the airport to the mall to, sigh, astoria) or the other (something special unique one of a kind), and it seems to me that as a previous poster noted, it won&#039;t be long before you ONLY have Starbucks, Applebees and the like to choose from.&nbsp; Sure it&#039;s consistant-- consistently mediocre. never horrible but certainly no surprises, and never great.<br /><br />

				In 1995, our Zoning Resolution was amended to make it easier for big box stores to settle within the city.&nbsp; This was because city residents wanted to shop at them and they were leaving the city to frequent them.&nbsp; Now the city gets tax revenues from Lowes and Home Depot, unskilled labor is employed at a relatively good wage, contractors who are based in the city can compete with those from the burbs because of the cheap supplies they can get.&nbsp; Property owners, outdoor markets vendors, construction projects, do-it-yourselfers all benefit from lower costs.&nbsp; &nbsp;Some hardware stores did go south, but the ones that evolved serve the neighborhood better now then they did before.&nbsp; And the shops which replaced the ones that did fail now service the insatiable demand of our hood&#039;s foodies.<br /><br />If you ask, I&#039;ll give the same run down for wal-mart, <span class="bbc_u">barnes &amp; nobles</span>, target, mcdonalds, TGIF, et cetera.&nbsp; Now I understand the concern about the inexorable march of capitalism, but the same knell rung for the Big Apple itself two decades ago.&nbsp; Now 2 grand gets you a closet in Williamsburg.&nbsp; Our transportation patterns, population densities and prosperity levels will not permit the city to go the way of the burbs.&nbsp; Shopping and entertainment is a regional matter in the burbs, drawing patrons from miles away.&nbsp; Here, it is a neighborhood matter, drawing patrons from blocks away.&nbsp; That market model will not allow a wal-mart on steinway.&nbsp; It will allow it though where automobile accesibility is key and there is room for parking, like in Bayside, or maybe even northern boulevard.&nbsp; Mom and pop shops, as long as economic darwinism forces them to evolve into their niches, shall always command a sizable portion of the market.<br /><br />As for picking up prime property, give Jane Jacobs a read.&nbsp; She wrote pretty insightfully about neighborhoods needing a mix of prime and not so prime property.&nbsp; If a population density is high enough, then both can still prosper and the neighborhood gets the widest range and depth of services. <br /><br />So if you don&#039;t like the chains, just ignore &#039;em.&nbsp; I ignore &#039;em, but I realize their importance.&nbsp; Just do what you can to make sure the city does not become the burbs.&nbsp; Do not let cars take over, do not let streets to be widened, do not accept urban renewal.&nbsp; Let chains exist, but they have to exist by our rules, not theirs.<br /><br /><br />

				Frappe --<br />I agree with your opinion about corporate chains to a point but you continue to leave out of your argument what geoworld has pointed out -- big box retailers receive tax breaks to set up shop, thus have a competitive edge over smaller business, courtesy of the City of New York. <br /><br />They earn profits at everyone&#039;s expense so yes they can offer cheaper &#039;stuff&#039; but we all suffer when the tax burden is shifted onto smaller businesses and homeowners, which in turn pass it along to tenants through higher rents, or higher prices, etc. we all pay one way or another.<br /><br />You can say this is business as usual but it does irk me whenever I hand over money to Home Depot or Best Buy.<br /><br />...and to all who rail against big coporate chains and retailers, like Walmart and Starbucks...but would be more than happy to see a Barnes and Noble set up stakes in Astoria. I myself have nothing against B&amp;N let&#039;s not forget that they are singly responsible for driving scores of bookshops out of business in this city.

				By looking at it from the consumer standpoint, which is the standpoint we are talking about in this thread, then I think I did address it.&nbsp; On the macro level, the consumer doesn&#039;t care.&nbsp; And on a personal level, its almost impossible to apply such principles except in the most gaulling cases.&nbsp; If most folk have no problem consuming Nestle products even though they murdered babies in Africa just to make their bottom line look fatter, then I think very few would have any compunction with frequenting a business who scored tax breaks.&nbsp; Though when it comes to the tax breaks, I completely agree with you.&nbsp; They can set up shop, but they should have to pay the same taxes.<br /><br />I don&#039;t mind a multi-national selling me toilet paper, lag nuts or flash drives, but the vanillafying effect Barnes &amp; Nobles has on literature does make me wary.&nbsp; In that case, I go against my own opinion and I will go out of my way and pay more to support an independent bookstore.&nbsp;

				Mmm...sure having big stores would give a boost to the real state (vroom, vroom). Just the way PC Richards gave a new face to steinway and 35th Ave. But Pc Richards doesn&#039;t produce a PILE of almost 5 feet high of garbage everyday.<br />Let&#039;s take a walk through Steinway today at 9:00pm. Is it worth it? And now all that garbage is coming thanks to Applebee&#039;s massive CHAIN-Low_quality-horrible taste, FAT producing food to my hood.<br />Why not a GNC, or another SPA, or a bookstore. <br />Any of those stores would bring the same &quot;vroom&quot; to the real state property (so if you are an owner is the same $$$ --$cashin!). Is this restaurant pleasing an unfulfilled demand? and if so --demand from WHO?<br />do we love when our kids get another choice of JUNK food?&nbsp; <br />

Is an I-pod made better then other MP3 players? does it last longer? Is the battery life better?<br />what is the difference in supporting applebees and apple.<br />If you care about companies getting tax breaks and making an obscene amount of profits why would you buy an i-pod why not support the small company who is trying to make it.<br />Last time i checked apple was making this things in china an it probably costs no more then $10 to produce it. Is that OK?<br />I know that I am comparing apples to oranges (no pun intended) but i am not I am comparing 1 huge corporation to another. Apple is in retail just like any other retailer and if they decide to open up a store on steinway I am sure all the nay sayers will be happy.<br /><br />In the end Applebees fate will be decided by the consumer, If people will come it will stay otherwise they will close down.<br />I remember when I lived in forest hills and they opened up a HUGE olive garden on queens blvd. by the Court house. Within 2 years the place was closed because the consumer preferred to go to the local Italian resturants. The peoples voice is still strong when it comes to corprate America and our voice is our money.<br />(i don&#039;t want to sound like i am running for presidency&nbsp; :-) )<br /><br />I know i wont be eating there.<br />

				For everyone that is speaking out against the big chains...how many of you buy no frills brands in the supermarket.&nbsp; I bet 85-95% of your products are big name brands like Charmin or Ruffles or Nabisco.&nbsp; You are so quick to put down chain businesses but you will still support the big businesses in the supermarket.&nbsp; What is the difference.&nbsp; Nabisco makes cigarettes that kill.&nbsp; Are you going to stop buying their products.&nbsp; Some how I doubt it.<br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong, I love the small mom and pop stores.&nbsp; I am all for the small businesses.&nbsp; One day I would love to own my own business.&nbsp; However, I would be lucky if I could grow my business to something hugh like Starbucks or McDonalds.&nbsp; We forget&nbsp; that at one point, these big corporations were just one store.&nbsp; They were built up by hard working men like Roy Croc or Howard Schultz.&nbsp; Is every big business good.&nbsp; No, of course not.&nbsp; But we have a choice to shop there.&nbsp; You may not like McDonalds or Wal-Mart, but Millions of people do like them and that is why they are still around.<br /><br />Anyone that has seen my post on here, know that I don&#039;t often say much.&nbsp; I am a quiet person and kind of keep things to myself.&nbsp; This post really ticks me off though.&nbsp; We have gone off topic again and I think a lot of people aren&#039;t really thinking about&nbsp; what they are typing.&nbsp; I don&#039;t mean to offend anyone and this is just my opinion..which everyone is allowed to have and I do respect that.&nbsp; I just wish that everyone would really think about what they are saying before saying it.&nbsp; And if I am wrong about any of this...I do apologize.

Common are we drinking coffee or we are ordering a complete 7 course meal in a French restaurant.<br />But as you said they cornered the market on coffee and you see people walking around with the starbucks cup as if they are carring a $3000 Gucci bag, its called BRANDING BRANDING BRANDING<br />again i have to say BUT this is why the American way is emulated all over the world, they hate us but they all want to be like us.<br />Where else a guy selling coffee from a cart become a billionare?<br />only in America, BABY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />

				I don&#039;t drink coffee, so I have little use for Starbucks and find them a bit annoying, especially since they seem to be everywhere, but I do understand that in terms of how they treat their workforce, they&#039;re among the most progressive companies around.&nbsp; They pay good wages, offer fairly comprehensive benefits and actually try to be socially responsible.&nbsp; I think there is a lot of difference in whether the big chains are good or bad.&nbsp;

Met Life was given at least $20 million of OUR tax money, if not more, to move to LIC and now they decide they don&#039;t like it and are looking to move out. Will they now give it back?<br /><br />Some other points to note:<br /><br />1) Last time I checked it was CUSTOMERS paying sales tax, not the retailer.<br /><br />2) If big stores can&#039;t operate without tax breaks then perhaps their business model is flawed. And if their business model if flawed why the hell do I have to subsidize them? My responsibility to keep them in business should end as soon as my purchases are rung up and paid for.<br /><br />2) Real estate tax must be paid regardless of whether a site is in use or not. Granted the tax is higher if a site is developed but in the case of big box retailers it my understanding they receive rebates on real estate taxes and I wonder if the city was receiving more money when a site was empty than when it has a fully operational superstore sitting on it. If I&#039;m wrong on this point, I&#039;ll accept I&#039;m wrong. But if I can afford to pay my property taxes without a rebate, the big box retailers should be able to as well.<br /><br />3) Jobs are created and I guess money is generated through payroll taxes but this only adds to revenue if the people working in the stores didn&#039;t have jobs or had lower paying jobs in the first place.<br /><br />3) Small stores don&#039;t get special treatment when it comes to taxes, electricity or anything else and they often have to operate in hostile environments, especially in regard to parking. It seems unfair to me to give HUGE corporations tax breaks period.<br /><br />By the way, I&#039;m in no way against the big chains in regard to what they sell or how they sell it but I think think the playing field should be leveled a bit and the city shouldn&#039;t encourage growth by helping put existing businesses out of business in favor of out-of-town corporations. <br /><br />Pheww. I&#039;m tired...and hungry. Is Applebees or Pantera or whatever open yet? I almost forgot what this discussion is about.

				Hi all&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; I just want to throw in my 2 cents.<br /><br />Panera = Awesome! fresh, delicious.<br />Applebee&#039;s = Disgusting, ridiculous excuse for food.<br /><br />I&#039;m from LI originally and there was a Panera near my house that I went to often - I&#039;ve yet to have a bad experience, the staff are always very friendly and professional, and the food is consistently yummy. The free wifi is also amazing.&nbsp; On LI, I&#039;d had the unfortunate occasional visit to Applebee&#039;s (ALWAYS someone else&#039;s decision) and each time I&#039;d think &quot;Maybe it won&#039;t be so bad this time&quot;... and it continually surprised me that it was not only possible, but probable that each experience might get worse and worse. I ordered their chicken and walnut salad... &quot;walnut&quot; is in the title of the salad.... My salad came out with what can only be described as walnut crumbs from the bottom of their walnut barrel. When I asked for more walnuts, the waitor told me that they used the last of the walnuts on my salad! They also forgot the blue cheese. I was furious (although I kept my calm), mainly because if they do not have enough of the necessary ingredients to make an item on the menu, they should TELL you so you can choose something else; they should not try to just wing it!!!<br /><br />One last thing - I worked at Chili&#039;s in Westbury for several years, before I moved here, and I know what it is like behind the scenes in a chain restaurant.&nbsp; I completely agree with previous posters who&#039;ve said eating out is never good - at Chili&#039;s, some customers would claim &quot;I&#039;m going to be good, give me the Quesadilla Explosion Salad&quot; and I didn&#039;t have the heart to tell them that this salad is in fact BAD for you, with over 60 grams of fat and over 1,000 calories.&nbsp; Although I respect Chili&#039;s having worked there for so long, it&#039;s restaurants like these that are fattening <strong>unsuspecting</strong> Americans - THAT is the problem. We have no clue what we&#039;re eating....

				The margarita sippy cup was likely a server getting a freebie from the bar and hiding it in a kids cup.&nbsp; Oops...grabbed the wrong one for the table.<br /><br />For fattening the unsuspecting Americans, it sounds like Bloomberg is trying to change that and requiring restaurants to put calorie counts on menus as big as prices and dish names.&nbsp; I dunno if it&#039;ll hit the big chains too, but it might.<br /><br />I know when I worked at Ruby Tuesday, they put the calorie counts on the menu.&nbsp; It was amazing that once people saw that the chicken, ribs, and fries had about 1600 calories that it&#039;s popularity dropped off pretty quickly.

				Yeah when I worked at Chili&#039;s, they had a &quot;Guilt-Free&quot; section on the menu that had all the calories and fat listed, and even that was higher than you&#039;d imagine - 685 calories for a piece of grilled chicken, some rice, and vegetables... it&#039;s scary thinking of the other items on the menu that still seemed healthy but weren&#039;t included in that guilt-free section... eating at restaurants is just bad, mmkay.

				Agreed.&nbsp; But many people just think of fast food as being Satan, but sit-downs are just as bad or worse.&nbsp; A burger&#039;s a burger.&nbsp; Just because it&#039;s at Chilapplennigandays doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s any healthier.

				I really hate how people will say they hate big chains like Applebees and in the same breath wish there was a Barnes and Nobles here.&nbsp; Can we look at the big picture.&nbsp; As I have said in the past, there is nothing wrong with big chains because at one time most of them were small businesses.&nbsp; They just did really well and expanded.&nbsp; My whole problem is that Applebees is horrible.&nbsp; I have yet to find one redeeming quality from them.<br />One last thought.&nbsp; For everyone that says they hate big chains and would rather go to smaller places like Peach Freeze of Igloo or wherever, what would you do if places like that made it really big and spread throughout the country.&nbsp; Would you stop going to them because they are a big chain?&nbsp; Probably not because you remember them when they were little places.&nbsp; &nbsp;

Oh and everyone&#039;s other favorite punching bag (even while they&#039;re using the free wi-fi): Starbuck&#039;s.<br /><br />But everyone else has made plenty of good points, the most obvious being: if you don&#039;t like a place don&#039;t go there. <br /><br />Perhaps this site needs a separate category for groaning and whining. Unless someone&#039;s proposing banning such places, wherein a central planning and/or socialist section can also be setup on astorians. Rise up comrades! ;-)<br /><br />Update: Oops, my bad, there already is a &quot;Politics &amp; Rants&quot; section. Maybe time to move this thread... we might still need the socialism one though!<br />

Then again, someone in another neighborhood/town/state will be pissed off when our &quot;local&quot; becomes their corporate invader.&nbsp;
