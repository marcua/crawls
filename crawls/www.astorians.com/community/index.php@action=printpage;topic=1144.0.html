				is anyone interested in doing a clothing swap?<br /><br />You bring clothes you're tired of looking at - but are in good condition<br /><br />We'd hang everyones clothes so they were on display<br /><br />and then we'd take turns taking a new item for each item we put in<br /><br />we'd add food and drink to make it social<br /><br />and we'd also want people of like sizes &nbsp;- or we could group by size if there's enough interest.<br /><br />The leftovers could either be brought back home - or donated<br /><br /><br />anyone anyone....<br /><br /><br />Where I used to live there were great consignment shops - here in queens there are crappy thrift shops and in Manhattan there are over priced &quot;gently worn designer&quot; shops. &nbsp; Of course if you know of a good consignment shop... throw that info out there too. &nbsp;I do go to one on 9th st between 1st and 2nd aves. &nbsp;The owner lives in astoria. &nbsp;But i haven't' found much there lately - and it's kind of pricey.

				It&#39;s about that time....<br /><br />I&#39;m going through my stuff and putting winter clothes in storage (It will NOT get cold again - I&#39;m praying)<br /><br />and before I put everything away until next fall... I&#39;d like to get rid of the stuff I didn&#39;t wear this winter.&nbsp; So... I could donate it... or you all could come over and pick through and see if any of my garbage is your treasure.<br /><br />See the first post in the thread for the true details of the swap.&nbsp; &quot;Garbage&quot; is only literary license.&nbsp; <br /><br />And for those who are wondering about sizes<br /><br />My tops are all M and L (some may have shrunk to S by this point) and pants range - from 6 - 10.&nbsp; So we&#39;re talking a WIDE range of available stuff and that&#39;s just MINE. <br /><br />If any of you truly petite lasses out there are interested we&#39;ll give you your own separate room.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;:-)<br /><br />Who&#39;s in??<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I might be interested. Especially when I pull out my spring stuff - that&#39;s when I usually discover stuff that I know I probably won&#39;t be wearing anymore. But I&#39;m waiting on that until it gets a little warmer.&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />I&#39;m like you, most of my stuff ranges from 6-10 (the 6&#39;s being the stuff I can&#39;t fit into anymore - ha!). In fact, I can already think of a couple of pairs of pants I could bring... Hooray for spring cleaning!

				come on folks - I know you need to clean out your closet -<br /><br />what better excuse than to organize for a clothes swap.&nbsp; <br /><br />if transport is a problem - i can make a run around the neighborhood with the automobile to pick up large loads.<br /><br />All the unswaped clothes can be donated to Salvation Army or Goodwill on Steinway.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />2 of us a swap does not make.... and I&#39;ve seen Amanda - there&#39;s NO way i&quot;m going to fit into her old clothes!!!<br /><br />&nbsp;:-)

				I&#39;m going to be pulling out the spring stuff this afternoon, I think, so I&#39;ll put aside items from various seasons in case a real swap gets going. I know of at least two or three pieces I never wear (and possibly never worn) that might be due a better home.<br /><br />But, most of it ranges from black to, uh, black ...

				I&#39;m glad this thread isn&#39;t dead.&nbsp; I have 2 bags of clothes ready to go. I went through my closet a few months ago but there isn&#39;t a good will near me.<br />Most of the clothes are in the 4-6 range.&nbsp; I do have a size 8 french connection skirt that is black silk with a beatiful pattern on it I think someone would like.<br />I wear a lot of black so I&#39;d like to see what dulouz-cats has..

				Okay, so I have two shopping bags set. I unfortunately did a pretty efficient job of purging before I moved as well. My spring/summer wardrobe consists of about 16 &quot;Favorite&quot; T-shirts (in black) from the Gap. Yeah, feel free to psychoanalyze me with that info ...<br /><br />The selection&#39;s not great, but, well, it&#39;s all stuff I&#39;ve never worn, or wore once. Mostly tops, sizes S or M. One dress and a skirt both S/4, though the dress seems to me closer to a 6 or 8. Not too much black, some, but, most of this stuff represents various failed attempts to add &quot;color&quot; to my wardrobe, which apparently is also not to be. <br /><br />Haven&#39;t gone through the shoes yet (I&#39;m a little squeamish about that, myself), but I&#39;ll take a look. Size 8.

				I have a bunch of clothes to get rid of. I have stuff that always looks good in the store, but then when I actually try to wear it, it just does not look right on me. I have lots of stuff in a Size 6 which I acquired when I was in a particularly ambitious mood and thought that I might actually be a size 6 again one day. Tops are mostly medium, some large-that-fit-like-a-medium. <br /><br />Size 8 shoes. I&nbsp; should get rid of my cute-but-impractical heels and accept the fact that I am too klutzy to wear them.<br />

				That was GREAT!!&nbsp; Thanks to all of you who made it!!<br /><br />I have to say that as i&#39;m here cleaning up I have actually tried on some more things that I hadn&#39;t noticed earlier that i&#39;m claiming.&nbsp; The casmere? purple cardigan (without it&#39;s twin) and the banana republic size 8L grey chinos.&nbsp; mine. <br /><br />anywho... there&#39;s a belt that was left that obviously goes to ... something.&nbsp; I didn&#39;t see anything as I was packing that it matched - so I wonder if someone took something and forgot the belt.&nbsp; It&#39;s sort of an olive green, cotton belt - the buckle are two silver hoops that you&#39;d thread the belt through and then fold it back through.&nbsp; It looks like it would go with a jacket?? maybe??&nbsp; I don&#39;t know.&nbsp; Let me know if you think it&#39;s yours.&nbsp; Or if you know what it went with and who got that item.&nbsp; <br /><br />Again - thank you all for coming.&nbsp; Cathy and Erin it was a pleasure to meet you both.&nbsp; Hope to see everyone again soon. <br /><br />J<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />

				Thanks for hosting this Jennifer! I too had a great time. In fact, I&#39;ve already worn TWO of the items I got!

				so <br />I&#39;m switching out the summer clothes with the fall/winter clothes... and realizing....<br /><br />it might be time for Swap II<br /><br />I want to find out if there is interest...<br />Seems that most of what I have though is summer stuff... and so I wonder if we should wait until warm weather... though I probably have some winter stuff to trade as well<br /><br />for those of you who missed the first swap it works like this:<br /><br />Bring those clothes that you&#39;re tired of looking at, or that don&#39;t fit you any more but are in good shape and bring them over.&nbsp; We hang and display all clothes that are up for trade and you get to basically go shopping for free.&nbsp; <br /><br />Leftover clothes were donated to Goodwill. <br /><br />Last swap had everything from size 2 to size 14.&nbsp; Tops, pants, jackets... whatever....&nbsp; we could even branch out to non clothing items...&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Let me know if you&#39;re interested.&nbsp; And let me know if you&#39;d be up for a 4 season swap - or just a fall/winter gear swap.&nbsp; <br /><br />And... as always... everyone is welcome - newbies and oldies alike.

				Hey... I didn&#39;t mean to let the ball drop on this.... I was just waiting for some more mediums to chime in. <br /><br />Sun Dec 10th &amp; 17th are possibilities.... and then people might score new party dresses for the end of the month.... or.... we can wait until January kicks in .... and give away all those hideous sweaters from Aunt Myrna.&nbsp; <br /><br />What dates work for everyone??&nbsp; <br /><br />Even if you&#39;re new to the board you are totally welcome.<br /><br />

				Well, you know, Jen, a clothing swap is a rare medium well-done. (Er, maybe I mean a small medium writ large?)&nbsp; Ok, ok, I&#39;ll stop.<br /><br />December is getting busier and busier, and I&#39;m not even sure I have any weekends left - maybe the 9th/10th.&nbsp; I&#39;d be happy to wait until January.
