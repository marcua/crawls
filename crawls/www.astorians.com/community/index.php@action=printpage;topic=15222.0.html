				I&#039;ll be back at the new Astoria walkway this Sunday with my jewelry collection. I&#039;ll be set up from 1-7pm with earrings, necklaces, bracelets, decorative bookmarks and my new phototile necklaces featuring original photos of astoria and nyc on metal tags. Stop by and check out what I&#039;ve got goin on and the other vendors. Though I shouldn&#039;t be spending my money while trying to make some I&#039;ve already snagged a couple of nifty items from other local artisans. It changes weekend to weekend, even within the weekend. The walkway market is on 31st st in the alley that leads to the 33rd street parking lot. So head out and get some brunch, run your errands, or stop by to or from your N train destination and check out what&#039;s there. This space has the potential to really support local artisans and crafters, but it really needs more weekend traffic. Astorians.com members have always been supportive of local artists and businesses and just stopping by the venue at some point this weekend is a great way to do just that.<br />Whaddya say? :-)<br /><br />For more info on Firelight Jewelry and designs check out:<br /><br />www.FirelightJewelry.artfire.com<br />or <br />fan us on Facebook (http://www.facebook.com/pages/create.php#/pages/Astoria-NY/Firelight-Jewelry-Designs/82268419567)<br /><br />(http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3377/3616550207_edfba7a66a_b.jpg)

				I totally forgot to post this week (otherwise I would have started a new thread about today instead of bumping my old one)but I&#039;m at the walkway again today (!) with my jewelry collection and with a bunch of other really cool designers. If you&#039;re walking around poke your head into the walkway and check it out. Or just say hi. Even stopping by to add to the traffic flow is really appreciated. And promise to post with more advance notice about the next 2 sundays.<br />Thanks!<br />Back to your regular more prompt postings. :-)
