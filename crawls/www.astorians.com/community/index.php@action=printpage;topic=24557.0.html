				28 y/o professional looking to find male or female roommate for 2B, 1 bath apartment for May move in.&nbsp; The apt is brand new and completely refurbished - all new appliances (including dishwasher), wood floors, tiled kitchen, central air conditioning.&nbsp; I have pictures of the apt, building, and neighborhood.&nbsp; The apt is currently being refurbished but you can get a sense of the layout.<br /><br />The owner owns several other buildings along the same street and lives across the street and two doors down.&nbsp; Rent is $2000/mo ($1000 each), with a security deposit of one month&#039;s rent and a negotiable broker fee of one month.<br /><br />It&#039;s a half-block/30 second walk to the M/R subway stop at 46th St. and Broadway in Astoria, Queens.&nbsp; If you work in Manhattan, this is extremely convenient for the price.&nbsp; It is 15 minutes once you&#039;re on the subway from the stop to the 53rd and 5th stop in Midtown.&nbsp; The line bisects the 4/5/6 for an easy transfer at 53rd and Lex or 59th and Lex, and then continues down the middle of the island.&nbsp; It&#039;s also an easy transfer to the E to reach the west side A/C/E line.<br /><br />Pets are fine with a pet deposit.&nbsp; It&#039;s a three story building, with a 2 bedroom apt on each floor, each with nearly identical layouts.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />The neighborhood is nice and quiet - a couple of bars/lounges, thai and chinese food, donut shop, cafes, health market, various bodegas, barbershops, the usual.&nbsp; There&#039;s also a large 24 hour gym one subway stop/ten minute walk away, a movie theater one stop away, and pretty much anything else you&#039;d need at the Steinway St. stop.<br /><br />I&#039;m friendly, neat, easy to get along with, non-smoker/drinker (but you do what you want), work full-time in Midtown, recent law school graduate, big sports fan, very sociable.&nbsp; I&#039;m looking for a relatively quiet atmosphere at home but I&#039;m flexible and won&#039;t be there all that much during the week.&nbsp; I have some furniture for the common area, but aside from the TV and couch, I don&#039;t have to keep it if you have stuff you&#039;d rather put in there.&nbsp; If you&#039;re a female and are concerned about living with a male roommate, I currently live with a female and she can provide a reference if you&#039;d like.&nbsp; I&#039;m cool with pets but don&#039;t have any.&nbsp; Obviously, plans change, but ideally, I&#039;m looking for a longer-term roommate who plans to live/work in the city for a few years and isn&#039;t planning on moving. Anything I&#039;ve missed, feel free to ask.
