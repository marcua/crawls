				I am going to be travelling several times this year and I need someone who can come to my apartment each day and feed my 3 cats, scoop the litter &amp; change their water.&nbsp; My first trip probably won&#39;t be until May.&nbsp; I live on 28th Street between 23rd &amp; 24th Avenues.<br /><br />

				Thank you both!&nbsp; Rapture, I checked out the thread about kennels but didn&#39;t see an address for Janimals.&nbsp; Is it in the Yahoo Yellow Pages maybe?&nbsp; What kind of activist are you anyway?&nbsp; Just curious&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />Jayme, you sound ideal since you&#39;re so close and have cats yourself.&nbsp; I&#39;ll keep your name and call you closer to the time I&#39;m going away.&nbsp; I&#39;m sure we can work out something.&nbsp; I&#39;m not too savy about how these threads work but I would like to exchange phone numbers and/or email addresses if you want to.&nbsp; I&#39;ll try to figure out how to send you a private message.<br /><br />Renee

				I googled her &amp; found the site.&nbsp; Thanks, again.&nbsp; Sounds like she&#39;s got a great operation.&nbsp; Did you actually leave your animal(s) with her or have her come by &amp; take care of yours?&nbsp; Or did you just hear of her by word-of-mouth?
