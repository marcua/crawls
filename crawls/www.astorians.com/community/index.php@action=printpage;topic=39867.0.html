				<span style="font-family: Verdana;" class="bbc_font"><span style="font-size: 2px;" class="bbc_size">Anyone else remember Lionel Playworld in Astoria. I know this may have been mentioned in a old topic discussion but I actually worked there as a Seasonal Stockperson/Cashier during the 1993 holidays. Unfortunately, it was being liqudated during that year as the store was facing Chapter 11 as of 1992-93 due to a Toys R&#039; Us buyout where they decided to just close all the stores. Very unfortunate since my mom worked there from the late 1970&#039;s to mid 1980&#039;s as a cashier in addition to Consumer&#039;s (remember that too?). </span></span><br />At any rate I was actually completing a job application and couldn&#039;t for the life of me remember the exact address. I had to research it for two days and thanks to Google search and Google Earth I not only was able to find an old pic of it in the 1980&#039;s but I was able to get what it looks like today and the address. I enlisted in the military in mid 1994 and it had already been turned into a Furniture store..then they removed the recognizable overhang....followed by a Young World (kids clothing store) and finally a Rainbow Clothing store (for Plus size women) split with Planet Fitness and some sort of restaurant. The building was built in 1930 but the whole place was renovated to nearly unrecognizable facade in 2010. <br />Wow...time does fly...but memories don&#039;t. If anyone else has worked there or knows people who have please feel free to reply. Also if you just want to share memories please do. Fyi the address is 30-33 STEINWAY STREET, ASTORIA, NY 11103 and enjoy the before and after pics I found.

				My mom brought me to Play World every now and again the 80&#039;s to early 90&#039;s. What a great toy store to visit as a kid growing up in Astoria!

				I remember that store!&nbsp; I didn&#039;t go there much, as I preferred Valco toy store on Steinway between Broadway and 34th Ave.<br /><br />If you check out the site 80s.nyc, you can look at entire blocks of Steinway (and other parts of Astoria) from the 1980s City tax photos.&nbsp; Very nostalgic.
