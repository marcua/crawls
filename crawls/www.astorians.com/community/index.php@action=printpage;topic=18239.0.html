				<br />I think there are arguments for and against, but I am suspicious about the intent.<br />If the argument is to be more inclusive or increase participation, you could have other voting systems and maintain party involvements.<br />Is there a reason to believe voters have changed minds to have them be nonpartisan.<br /><br /><br />As it is, I think many accept voting in a Dem primary as a key selection. Would it be possible to allow parties to have multiple candidates for a general election?<br />Again I am reminded of reforms suggested for runoffs.<br /><br /><br />The Charter revision discussions may play games with term limits again.<br /><br />http://www.nyc.gov/html/charter/html/home/home.shtml<br /><br /><br /><br />Tuesday, May 25 – TERM LIMITS<br /><br />Place:&nbsp; Brooklyn Borough Hall, 209 Joralemon Street<br />BROOKLYN <br />Time:&nbsp; 6 p.m. <br /><br />Wednesday, June 2 – VOTER PARTICIPATION <br /><br />Place:&nbsp; Lehman College, 250 Bedford Park Boulevard West<br />Music Building, Faculty Dining Room<br />BRONX <br />Time:&nbsp; 6 p.m. <br /><br />Thursday, June 10 – GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE <br /><br />Place:&nbsp; Staten Island Technical High School, 485 Clawson Street<br />STATEN ISLAND <br />Time:&nbsp; 6 p.m. <br /><br />Wednesday, June 16 – PUBLIC INTEGRITY<br /><br />Place:&nbsp; City College, 160 Convent Ave<br />MANHATTAN <br />Time: 6 p.m. <br /><br /><strong>Thursday, June 24 – LAND USE <br /><br />Place:&nbsp; Flushing Branch, Queens Borough Public Library<br />41-17 Main Street, Flushing<br />QUEENS <br />Time:&nbsp; 6 p.m.</strong> <br />

				I grew up in California where they have non-partisan elections. . Well, not really. The ballot contained no party lines....but you pretty much knew who was what. However, it created, at times, a very vigorous election season<br /><br />But, I had thought about this over the last two days. I was confused when someone in the JFP/AS thread had challenged JFP regarding a &quot;petition slate&quot;. Why is one limited to a slate and can&#039;t sign any other petitions to get a candidate on the ballot. <br /><br />The only answer I can think of is to limit competition. <br /><br />This is the first election I have seen in NYC with a open seat. And, it seems to me that the system is set up to insure that no outsider can be a spoiler. <br /><br />I remember in 2000 when McCain had to go to court to get on the ballot because the state GOP had decided to support Bush and set the deck to exclude McCain. <br /><br />I don&#039;t like the process here. I don&#039;t mind the endorsements. I don&#039;t like the fact that there is not a vigorous and open process that allows for many candidates and open debate. Yes, it can be messy......but isn&#039;t that what it is all about? <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I strongly oppose non-partisan elections myself - I like knowing what party people are caucusing with and with whom they are aligned.&nbsp; I think non-partisan elections would basically allow the wealthy to purchase their way into office with campaigns decrying the two parties.&nbsp; Bloomberg is more than enough non-partisan for me.<br /><br />Candidates often get on slates both in Queens and the rest of the city, it allows for coordination of resources and volunteers between campaigns and is not always an endorsement, though usually that is the case.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think being on a slate keeps people out - you can always draft your own petitions and work to get on the ballot, though a slate makes it easier for candidates who are part of the slate to qualify.&nbsp;

				No thanks.&nbsp; I recall that one of Barrack Obama&#039;s arguments for his competence and qualification to be president was running a campaign.&nbsp; Although, I do not agree with him on much, I think he had a point, at least by the time he had won the Democrat nomination.&nbsp; <br /><br />How many different lines are available on the ballot in NY?&nbsp; Off the top of my head, I can think of a handful: GOP, Democrat, Green, Conservative, Liberal, and whatever that SEIU front group calls itself-Working Families or something like that.<br /><br />That is six freakin lines.&nbsp; And, unless I miss my guess, there are a few fringe groups that get on the ballot from time to time.&nbsp; In other words, if you want to get yourself on the ballot in NY, I imagine you could with relatively little difficulty.<br /><br />The process, as it were, is open to outsiders, and that is one of the few things I actually like about NY politics.

A single handpicked candidate would then get support, he said, while challengers would be shunned.<br /><br />“Ninety-nine percent of the Republicans that were involved in choosing our candidates are now excluded from choosing our candidates,” Mr. Nehring said. “In the future this decision will be made by no more than a few thousand and, in most cases, a few dozen.”<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I hope NY would encourage voter participation.

				I am all for debates that permit all the candidates to participate.&nbsp; In fact, I would like to see debates without a moderator.&nbsp; The current format used for most debates is more like a quiz show than a real give-and-take between candidates.
