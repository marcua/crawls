				Hey all!&nbsp; A frequent poster here...and I wanted to invite / put the word out for our sketch comedy show on Monday night (May 21st) in the city.&nbsp; <br /><br />With the exception of one castmember, we are ALL Astorians!<br /><br />There&#039;s no cover charge for the show so if you are around, do come on by - I ain&#039;t lyin when I say it&#039;s funny stuff.&nbsp; Happy Spring!! --jr<br /><br />LionHearted Players present “AMERICAN MIDOL”<br />An emotional evening of Comedy, Music, Cannibalism, and Magic<br /><strong><br />Monday, May 21 @ 7:00pm&nbsp; &nbsp; ---&nbsp; &nbsp; Broadway Comedy Club&nbsp; <br />318 West 53rd Street (@ 8th Ave.)&nbsp; <br />NO COVER (2 drink minimum)—reservations suggested - 212-757-2323<br /></strong>&nbsp; <em><br />Join The LionHearted Players as they present their latest twisted comedy / variety show, featuring the <br />New York City debut of Miami sketch comedy troupe PUNCH 59, “The Rob And Mark Show” (SpikeTV’s “Geek Ray Vision”) and out-of-this-world magical comedy with Magician Dave Cremin!<br /><br />PUNCH 59 (1996-2001) was South Florida’s only sketch comedy troupe, logging over 165 performances. The Ft. Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel calls PUNCH 59&nbsp; randy, rowdy, scathing satire&quot; and the Miami New Times hailed them as &quot;bold, original, sophisticated sketch comedy.&quot; After a large dose of electricity, PUNCH 59 is proud to be revived and performing again in New York City and features Jen Ryan (original PUNCH 59 castmember &amp; FringeNYC ’04 Outstanding Performance Award), Rik Sansone (Summer ’69), Amir Darvish (Mercury: The Afterlife and Times of a Rock God), and Kate Stuetzel.&nbsp; &nbsp;PUNCH 59 alums have appeared in theatre, TV, commercials, films, and voice-overs, and include Jill Michele-Melian (MAD-TV &amp; Reno 911!), Karen Gordon (Legally Blonde II) &amp; Larry Robinson (Sergeant Kabukiman) <strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;www.punch59comedy.com</strong><br /><br />THE ROB AND MARK SHOW is a two-man musical comedy/stand-up show in the grand, insane tradition of the Smothers Brothers, Blues Brothers and Tenacious D! Rob Gorden and Mark Douglas have been performing with the LionHearted Players since 2002 and are the hosts of GEEK RAY VISION on Spiketv.com. <br />www.myspace.com/therobandmarkshow<br /><br />MAGICIAN DAVE CREMIN puts a twisted spin on old tricks, combining stand-up with magic, illusion, and sleight of hand.&nbsp; You may want to leave the kids – and your larger bills - at home…this ain’t your kids’ birthday party magic show!&nbsp; www.outofthisworldmagic.com<br /><br />THE LIONHEARTED PLAYERS began as an actor’s workshop in the LES’ Planet One Café in 2001.&nbsp; Since then, producers (and spouses) Powell Leonard and Ella Louise have produced variety, music, and comedy shows featuring some of New York’s most talented singers and comedians.&nbsp; The LionHearted Players have performed to packed houses all over New York City including Don’t Tell Mama’s, Danny’s Skylight, Undercroft Performance Space, and are proud to be making their debut at the Broadway Comedy Club.<br /></em>
