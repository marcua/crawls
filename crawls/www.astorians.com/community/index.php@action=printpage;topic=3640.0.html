				Ok, so noone has taken the ball and ran with it... so i will be proposing something new.<br /><br />Hows about a cheap/bar/chill EATS? I&#39;ve been looking for a day and an excuse to go to Indigo, the new bar lounge place that Harlan kindly reviewed. We can eat drink and be merry. And we can still take advantage of the outdoors with their cool back patio with fireplace. Its on 31st St and 30th Ave. Its just an idea. <br /><br />Any other places you&#39;ve been wanting to try?<br />

				Well i&#39;m thinking this Thursday is a little soon for people to make plans no?<br />How&#39;s about next Thurs the 12th?<br /><br />This might be a good thing, being less formal and cheap and all encompassing?!?!? I would hope that we&#39;d be a boatload of peeps up in there and we&#39;d show the new business that we appreciate them not being another greek cafe! It&#39;s like an Astorian mixer but with chow too.

				Ugh, I really wanted to go to this, but it looks like I won&#39;t be able to make it. I&#39;ve been on this board 3 months, and this is the third EATS that I can&#39;t make! Anyone remember that baby shower I was whining about earlier this week? Well UPS finally decided to deliver what I ordered (a high chair, a friend and I went in on it), and I have to deliver it to Long Island tomorrow night. I shoulda just had it shipped to their house to begin with, but oh well.<br /><br />Come hell or high water, I WILL MAKE IT TO AN ASTORIA EATS EVENT BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR!

				Woo! This thread has gotten racy!<br /><br />I may have to do the ol&#39; swing by, grab a quick drink, then get home. I&#39;ll be working late and then have to clean my entire apartment tonight. Hrm.. fun! Hopefully some folks will still be around.

				tonight was great fun but not because of the food... that said, the outdoor space is really nice and this location would work really well for an Astorians social :)<br />

				I had lots of fun last night - it&#39;s always great to see y&#39;all!&nbsp; :wink: Indigo was really nice and I liked the outdoor space too. Food was good but the service.....not so much.... maybe they will get better with time.<br /><br />On our way to the train for this EATS! Lanseaux and I found $20 and we split it! <br /><br />Loved getting a glimpse of Goldfish Boy&#39;s improv!&nbsp;

				I botched my first gathering!&nbsp; I completely had it in my head that it was next Thursday. I&#39;m not EATS worthy.&nbsp; &nbsp;I was so looking forward to meeting everyone.&nbsp; How was it?&nbsp; I&#39;m definitely heading to the next one!

				Did GFB do improv last night at Indigo?!?!?&nbsp; Damn it!&nbsp; &nbsp;Did all you kiddies have fun?&nbsp; &nbsp;Sorry we missed it.&nbsp; We ate there wed night.&nbsp; Food was totally forgetfull, Guinness was watery and cold but it is a nice place. Service was fine.<br /><br />I&#39;m sure they are just getting up to speed and look forward to going again.
