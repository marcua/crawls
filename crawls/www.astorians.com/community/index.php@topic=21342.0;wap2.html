			I was chatting with a friend and had to explain to him the border between Astoria and LIC ends on Broadway but he say&#039;s it&#039;s Between 34 and 36 ave. I said to him hell no! I ask why do you say that and he says a real estate agent explained it to him long ago.&nbsp; I tell him the real estate agents always spread the borders further out and labels parts of Woodside as Astoria and parts of LIC as Astoria. Then I asked an old timer and he say&#039;s from 34 ave and beyond it&#039;s Dutch Kills followed by LIC.&nbsp; So who&#039;s right??

			On lower streets it is.&nbsp; You are right.&nbsp; &nbsp;People who live along&nbsp; Broadway, even as far south as 37th avenue, usually say they are in/from&nbsp; Astoria.&nbsp; It is LIC though.&nbsp; One side is, one side of Broadway isn&#039;t.&nbsp; Example,&nbsp; Bel Aire Diner is Astoria, gas station across street is LIC.&nbsp; &nbsp;That is&nbsp; being technical though, if you go by zip codes.&nbsp; &nbsp; Well, maybe official if we go by zip code.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

			There is no generally acknowledged border between Astoria and LIC - some say Broadway, some say 30th Ave, some say 36th Ave. I&#039;m sure there are other opinions. I don&#039;t trust real estate agents with this question - they will answer it in a way that benefits them professionally (understandable), even if it seems a bit off.&nbsp; Personally, I consider 36th Ave to be the border but a half dozen people will say I&#039;m wrong. C&#039;est la vie.
