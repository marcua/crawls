			hey fellow hockey fans and players if your as pissed as i am about the NHL lockout and really wanna play roller hockey you should come join us at hoyt park in Astoria queens under the N train station across from Neptune dinner and near the basketball and handball courts. me and my friends have been playing on that flat area for a few years we just started playing again and are looking for other players who would like to join. we play for fun and have a goalie with equipment and are working on a goalie net as we speak. we usually try to get 3 on 3&#039;s going when we have enough people. we play on Sundays and usually get there from around 1pm to 2 pm and play the afternoon. we have some people who play on skates and some on feet but its always a great game. again we play for fun and if your interested come on thru you&#039;ll see us in the benches across from the basketball courts. bring your skates and stick and maybe we can get some good games going. if u need any info email me at sofaisking88@gmail.com or just respond back to this post and i will get back to ya hope to see some of u on Sunday.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; frm: ray
