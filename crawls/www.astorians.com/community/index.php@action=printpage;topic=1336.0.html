				Les Moules is the Belgian tapas/mussels/frites/beer place on Ditmars and 35th St. Apparently it&#39;s a &quot;location-of-death&quot;, although I haven&#39;t been in the nabe long enough to see that. (Or so I thought...)<br /><br />I and my dining companion have been twice. The first time was a few days after they opened, and the second time was a few days ago. Oddly, the experiences were remarkably similar... Even down to the same waiter...<br /><br />On our recent visit, we had a coupon from Clipper for free tapas and salad with purchase of an entree. We ordered an apple-rutabega soup, and the steak frites (medium), plus the tapas and salad. The tapas were these crisp baked puffed-up pita cracker things, a failed attempt at hummus, a cup of soup, and a salad. The crackers were OK, but the hummus was awful. Horribly dry and tasteless. The &quot;chunky style&quot; hummus in the little deli case near the front of the nearby Key Foods is really excellent, incidentally. The soup, oddly, was the apple-rutabega soup we&#39;d ordered additionally. The salad was simple, but pretty good. Speaking of incidentally, I highly recommend the salad with walnuts, feta and balsamic vinegar at Philoxenia... OK, we finished that, and... a bowl of soup came out! This is the one we&#39;d specifically ordered, but they&#39;d gotten confused and given us the cup of the apple-rutabega, and the bowl of the &quot;tapas&quot; soup, which was a pretty decent creamy pumpkin. OK. Then we got the steak. It was a New York Strip, cooked medium-well to well, with a decent sauce. The fries were good. <br /><br />The waiter was exceptionally friendly, and a bit less manic than on our first visit. There were only a couple of other guests. The bill ended up being about $28. Their credit card machine wasn&#39;t working, so I had to run to the ATM (and pay an extra surcharge) to get cash.<br /><br />Overall, as I commented to my dining companion, it seemed as if they were having the same start-up confusion that they had 6 months earlier!<br /><br />And now I know why! Les Mousles&#39; web site is http://www.lesmoulesny.com/ . If you go there, you get the following:<br /><br /><pre>The Restaurant at this location<br />has one more&nbsp; time<br />Changed management...<br />will keep you updated when new plans are made public<br /></pre><br /><br />Hah! And indeed, their current menu (as photocopied and posted on their windows) is significantly changed from their old menu (http://www.lesmoulesny.com/dinner.html), which is still available on their website if you go through Google&#39;s cached version (http://64.233.161.104/search?q=cache:NaDTU3rVE04J:www.lesmoulesny.com/+les+moules+astoria+menu&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a). Their old menu was rather better.<br /><br />I guess that explains a few things...<br />

I&#39;d say give it a month or so to gets its act together, and if it hasn&#39;t folded by then, I think it&#39;d be a fun place to go. I don&#39;t remember much vegetarian on their menu, though. <br />

				You know, a really good vegetarian restaurant (like Greens in SF) would be awesome here.&nbsp; Vegetarian food that is fresh with clean flavors and influenced by various world cultures.&nbsp; I find the food at Zen Palate and Angelica&#39;s Kitchen to be over (or under) cooked and uninspired, and have not found a vegetarian restaurant I really love out here.&nbsp; I would like to try some of the raw food places in Manhattan, though, and see how they are.&nbsp; But I do miss the delicious and beautiful food I could get at Greens.

				megc - I&#39;m not a vegetarian, but one of my favorite low-key restaurants to go to in the city is Kate&#39;s Joint. They have only vegetarian and vegan food (dishes can be customized either way, like if you want real cream or whatnot). It&#39;s a bit of a trip from Astoria, in the east village, but definitely worth a try if you have a hankering for some veggie comfort food. And they have $2 PBR.&nbsp; :wink: It&#39;s at Avenue B and 4th Street.
