				Did anyone else preserve their CSA veggies this past season?&nbsp; I froze and canned some things and am so glad I did!&nbsp; I just had a lunch of green beans (I froze them) in tomato sauce (sauce from my tomato share that I canned) with organic eggs poached in it all.&nbsp; Delicious!&nbsp; The only thing I regret is that I didn&#039;t preserve more that I did.

				those beans sound delicious! I wasnt part of the CSA, but I flash froze tons of local blueberries from the summer and made some amazing pies for a holiday party. Now it&#039;s all about pickling stuff - still fun, but not as delicious.

				Hi Megc -<br /><br />I sauteed and then froze a mixture of bok choy, various greens, celery &amp; onions and now use them in a wok mixed with chicken, shrimp, etc. and brown rice for an almost instant (and healthy) &quot;Chinese&quot; meal.<br /><br />Wish I&#039;d frozen more too . . .

				Right on, astoriagirl!&nbsp; Next summer I&#039;m going to try to can and freeze more, myself.&nbsp; I&#039;m down to only 2 pints of tomatoes and boy will I miss them when they&#039;re gone.&nbsp; Your idea to sautee the greens and such, then freeze them, is a good idea.&nbsp; I&#039;ll have to remember that next summer!

				Which CSA do you belong to?&nbsp; I belong to the Astoria CSA.&nbsp; Sign up for that one is January 15 for previous members.&nbsp; The fruit share was really worth it . . . additional cost, but worth it.
