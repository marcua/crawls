				Hello all,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve recently run into some difficulty where I&#039;m about to be one roommate short come next week. I&#039;m currently in a 3 br and my other roommate still wants to live together. We love the neighborhood and want to stay in the area, so we&#039;re looking for a 2 br apartment ASAP. If we can at least secure a place for a move-in date in mid-June or early July that would be ideal so we don;t cause any problems with the current landlord and make matters even worse than they are and because we&#039;re on a month-by-month lease and he is really nice. We&#039;re both employed full-time, mid-20&#039;s. Non-smoker/partier, no pets. We&#039;re looking (or rather, hoping) to find a 2 br for no more than $1400. If we can not go through a realtor/broker that would be ideal, but we don;t really have our hopes set very high for that.&nbsp; If anyone knows of any places or even realtors that have places in that price range, please e-mail me or if you need anymore information from me, don;t hesitate to let me know. Thank you very much. <br /><br />-Josh

				I&#039;m in exactly the same situation.&nbsp; We&#039;ve only been looking on Craigslist, but if you hear of any other website, let me know:) Also, I haven&#039;t found any apt listings on it, but astoria-ditmars.com is another local forum you might check out.<br /><br /><br />
