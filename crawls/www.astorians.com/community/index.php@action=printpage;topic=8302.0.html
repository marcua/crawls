				maybe this belongs in the rants section....<br /><br />i&#039;m becoming increasingly annoyed at the Q101 bus.<br />i live east of steinway street. and above astoria boulevard.&nbsp; i work in Jamaica. so i take the Q101 bus down steinway to get the R and take the trains to Jamaica.&nbsp; <br /><br />it doesnt get me to work on time if i get to the bus stop one hour before work begins (because the bus seems to be very unpredictable). so today, i got to the bus stop an hour and a half before work begins. that bus was stuck at the intersection of steinway and astoria boulevard for more more than 5 light changes. it&#039;s quite frustrating.<br /><br />and then of course, when we get to subsequent stops, there are tons of people waiting. one by one get on the bus. and then people fight to get on because it&#039;s crowded. and people fight to get off because it is crowded. <br /><br />is my annoyance at the Q101 justified?<br />is it just the traffic at Astoria Boulevard that is the problem? the construction (STILL!!!!) going on at that overpass?<br />is there a better way to get to Jamaica that i don&#039;t know about?

				I feel your pain... Im another who lives at the intersection of Steinway and Astoria Blvd. and take the 101 (to work in Jamaica as well).&nbsp; The traffic in the morning is not that bad, yet the bus is ALWAYS late, and many times, the &quot;scheduled&quot; bus just never comes.&nbsp; Its not quite as bad as the Q46 I have to take on Union Tpke, but its slowly getting there. Sorry, dont know any easier way.

				I see that traffic every morning backing up past 23rd Ave. Probably faster to walk to the south side of the blvd and pick up the buses that <strong>were</strong> stuck in the traffic over there. I know I can walk to 28th ave faster than the traffic will get there when it&#039;s backed up like that.<br />At least the bridge itself is open- it was worse when it was shut down southbound for repairs!

				Can you get to the 19A? That runs down Ditmars to 21st St, right? You can pick up the F at Queensbridge from there, then change for the E at Roosevelt, Continental or Union Tpke (depending upon where in Jamaica you work). <br /><br />I also work in Jamaica and take the 102 from 30th Avenue and 31st Street, down 31st Street to Queens Plaza for the E (or take the 18 to the 101 to Steinway, or just walk if the weather is decent). The 102 comes pretty infrequently, though, so I have to time it just right or I&#039;m getting to work WAY late.<br /><br />

				If I ever leave Astoria, I certainly won&#039;t ever miss the 101! <br /><br />I could not deal with having to rely on the bus on an everyday basis.&nbsp; Too subject to whims of traffic conditions.&nbsp; When looking at apartments, I do not even consider anything which is not walking distance to the train.

				This problem with the Q101 is most recent. It&#039;s been going on for the past month. I&#039;ve been regularly riding that bus for the past 3 years without a problem. I&#039;m down on 20th Avenue and Steinway and it is so much more convenient for me to take that bus to the R train then rushing down to the N Train.&nbsp; It seems as though the light is slow on Steinway and Astoria Blvd.&nbsp; From what I understand a few of the passengers have dialed 311 to report the traffic problem.&nbsp; Even our bus driver was saying that if they have a few traffic cops directing traffic it could alleviate the problem somewhat.&nbsp; Lately, I&#039;ve had to resort to leaving earlier to make it to work on time.&nbsp; Hopefully the traffic issue will soon be resolved.
