				<br />Are you angry about this?&nbsp; 8 Democratic Senators voted AGAINST gay marriage in NY.&nbsp; We knew the Republicans weren&#039;t going to help with equality rights.&nbsp; This is a disgrace.&nbsp; Sen.

				Onorato&#039;s a Democrat who doesn&#039;t know the meaning of the word.&nbsp; Today was just a hiccup on the way to the eventuality of marriage equality in New York State, and Onorato&#039;s tenure grows ever shorter as he becomes more and more irrelevant in the minds of his constituents.

				<br />What plans may Gianaris have in 2010, to consider the Senate??<br />Does Cuomo stand with Paterson and supporters or with the opposition?<br /><br /><br />I am sorry to hear the Senate lets state prejudice continue.<br />There certainly was bipartisan discrimination. I take it many believe this was how they would find re-election next year.<br />At least voters now have a record to consider. That is a minimal consolation.<br /><br /><br />Beyond looking to get representatives to vote for fairness, I also suggest reaching out to more voters as to why this matters.<br /><br />http://www.prideagenda.org/tabid/304/default.aspx?c=402<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">This list represents a diverse group of faith traditions and congregations from all corners of our state. The leaders of these religious institutions understand the spiritual value of respecting all members of their community, including those who are lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, said Empire State Pride Agenda Executive Director Alan Van Capelle. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />http://www.gothamgazette.com/blogs/wonkster/2009/12/02/the-marriage-vote-and-the-aftermath/<br /><br />Coverage of the vote:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />Then Republicans requested a slow roll call–meaning each Senator would be able to speak about how he or she was voting. Democratic nay votes came quickly: Sens. Joseph <strong>Addabbo</strong>, Darrel <strong>Aubertine</strong>, Ruben <strong>Diaz</strong>, Sr., Shirley <strong>Huntley</strong>, Carl <strong>Kruger</strong>, Hiram <strong>Monserrate</strong>. <strong>Republicans </strong> also chimed in in the negative, softly saying, “No.” When it was his turn to vote, Sen. Pedro Espada said “Yes,” and “Yes to as many do-overs” as necessary.<br /><br />Things started to look grim for the bill. By the time Sen. Kevin Parker was called upon to vote it was clear the measure was doomed. He grew visibly upset and called out members for being scared about “getting reelected.” But the Democratic nays continued. George <strong>Onorato </strong> and Bill <strong>Stachowski </strong> also voted in the negative.&nbsp; When the bill was announced as “lost” by a vote of 24-38 there was a surge to the exi ts. Outside, protestors chanted and screamed.<br /><br />Duane stood in the corner of the room taking questions from the press. He said he had been “<strong>betrayed</strong>,” but wouldn’t name names. He said he had assurances that didn’t pan out.<br /><br />Then Gov. David Paterson made his way into the press scrum, sidling up to Duane. He went to console Duane, but the Senator insisted he continue speaking to the press, as he had committed to do so. Paterson waited. Then questions were fired at Paterson. Did he regret bringing the bill to a vote, now that it had been defeated? Paterson said he did not regret it.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				It does seem there was quite a bit of cowardice.<br /><br />I have read of a good deal of blame pinned to Dems.

				Just a quick, slightly OT, follow up on TRX&#039;s quote:<br /><br />Years ago when my partner and I got our Domestic Partnerhip through the City (which was later replaced by a marriage license in CT now that it&#039;s been legal there for a year) the people at the next desk getting a marriage license were doing so with the help of a translator. &nbsp;Mind you, this was not a translator to aid in the process but was being used to help the husband and wife applicants communicate with ONE ANOTHER! &nbsp;The person doing the license didn&#039;t even flinch at this absurdity but we certainly did as we were paying $1 more for a limited rights Domestic Partnership than they were paying for a real marriage license.

				JoeyC - with all due respect, a legally binding marriage is a contract and not a religious even.&nbsp; That is what I&#039;m interested in.&nbsp; I&#039;m not interested in having a wedding, getting lots of presents or people fawning attention all over us (which is exactly the reason we didn&#039;t tell our friends we got legally married in CT until two months after the fact).&nbsp; What I want is the legal rights that you share with your wife (if you are married), not having to pay an exorbitant amount to in taxes to carry him on my health insurance and to have the same basic human rights that comes with a marital contract that is taken for granted so often by everyone - is that too much to ask?

				It amazed me when one NY Democratic senator said New Yorkers didn&#039;t care about gay marriage because of its bad economy.&nbsp; <em>WTF??</em><br /><br />Wouldn&#039;t having a slew of same-sex marriages in NY state BOOST the economy?&nbsp; Imagine all the hotels, catering, florists, salons, B&amp;Bs, printers, DJs, wedding bands and gift stores that would have gotten a much-needed financial shot in the arm.&nbsp; We&#039;re not stupid, Senator.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t about economics, at all.<br /><br />It&#039;s about fear of change.<br /><br />We don&#039;t want the religious part of marriage (with 50% of marriages ending in divorce those church bells don&#039;t seem to guarantee success for a couple anyway), but the legal FEDERAL rights that come with it are crucial.&nbsp; My partner is not from the USA.&nbsp; We&#039;ve been together 7 years here in Astoria.&nbsp; If we were, say, to get married tomorrow in CT, it wouldn&#039;t mean ANYTHING regarding her potential citizenship.&nbsp; Zilch.&nbsp; We asked an attorney.&nbsp; He said &quot;your union means nothing on the federal level.&quot;&nbsp; When I added my partner to my health benefits, the Human Resources woman said &quot;Don&#039;t forget -- they&#039;ll tax you big time on this as an INCOME.&nbsp; Are you sure you want to add her to your benefits?&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s so unfair and must change.&nbsp; Let&#039;s not get so hung up on the &quot;marriage&quot; word and start fighting on a federal level.&nbsp; The states won&#039;t do much for us anyway.&nbsp; <br /><br />Keep up the good fight.&nbsp;
