								<div class="inner" id="msg_4512">Hi Kaosaur, I'm having problems with my computer automatically restarting. I suspected it had something to do with a conflict with the sound card [(Creative SB Live! series (WDM)] but I think (by process of elimination) that this is not the case, and now I am suspecting a short rather than a software problem. It could also be the temperature, though I think this unlikely. Is there an application to monitor the temperature of the CPU? I notice that the comp tends to shut down when I have music or applications running... it's almost as if this were too much for it to handle... and over time it shuts down more frequently (temperature?).<br /><br />[Am still looking for applications to moniter the temperature of the CPU et alii. and have got a lead... Will soon be posting links here /Ed.] <br /><br />The computer previously belonged to a hardcore gamer and has been upgraded by him (sound card, memory) and was Extremely dirty and dusty. Also the moniter's chord is kablooey (I had to tie it in a knot to get the monitor to work)- could this be the problem...will try connecting to another monitor [Much later: nope, that's not the problem]. I don't see anything wrong with the fans (I cleaned them &amp; air-canned the rest) or the connections. Microslut's site has been less than helpful. Ran CWS, Ad-Aware &amp; Spybot in that order in safe-mode. Also noticed that the computer didn't restart automatically in safe-mode (I fell asleep for about six hours with it on).<br /><br />I haven't gotten around to shutting off the &quot;services&quot; yet as blackviper's site has been down. [Much later: O.k., I shut the majority of &quot;services&quot; down (Blackviper's site is still down, wtf? got to send him some $) hopefully this will work] [Much much later: Nope, that didn't work either]<br /><br />[Later: Am now booting up with a live CD of Knoppix, just to see whether in fact this problem is a hardware problem or a software conflict]<br /><br />[Later: System crashed and re-booted. Well, I&#039;m led to believe that it is indeed a hardware problem and I suspect that the gamer&#039;s upgrades were too much for this box to handle. And here I was all ready to screw Microsoft and install a clean version of Ubuntu! which I plan to do anyway as soon as I get this accursed thing fixed. Later tonight or tomorrow I will re-go-over all the connections, uninstall the added memory and sound card and clean it yet again. Unless of course somebody out there has figured out the problem. If all else fails then I will bring it to Growtechsolutions and ask how much it will cost for a preliminary diagnostic.

It is one of my favorite articles.<br /><br />Enjoy :-),<br />-zen cf<br /><br />[Note: One word, the &quot;S&quot; word as in sh*t has been censored by phpBB /Ed.]<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">A history of 31337sp34k<br />From DocDroppers<br />Author: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;StankDawg<br />Date Released: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;07/15/2002 - In 2600 Magazine (<a href="http://store.yahoo.com/2600hacker/fall2002.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://store.yahoo.com/2600hacker/fall2002.html</a>).<br />Added to DD: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;09:44, 23 Nov 2004 (EST)<br /><br /><br />Y d0 j00 hakkerz al’//4ys t4lK Lik3 Th!s?<br /><br /><br />Well first of all, I am not going to write the entire article in “elite speak”. It defeats the purpose and is annoying beyond belief in this context. What I am going to do is enlighten the new generation of hakkerz into what “elite speak” is, where it came from, and when (and if) to use it. It has become commonplace in the hakker community, but I think everyone should understand its origins.<br /><br /><br />Long before Internet Explorer was even thought of, and when Netscape was still a wet dream, the Internet existed. Most people reading this article know that the Internet is not the same as the World Wide Web, but for the novices, it imperative to point this out. Back then, we used to communicate through earlier aspects of the internet, some of which still exist today. The most prominent are Email, Newsgroups, and Internet Relay Chat (IRC).<br /><br /><br />Let’s start with Email. It is the most obvious and widespread in use. Its use has exploded since back in the early days. Back then, we used emoticons to convey emotions, not to decorate our email with pretty pictures. We didn’t come up with the word “emoticons”, that was some media bullshit label made up to be cute. We used them for effectiveness. Using emoticons could convey in a couple of keystrokes what might take several sentences. Keep in mind that back then, we had to keep our messages short and sweet. I used a 300 baud modem (the coupler kind that you had to put the headset into) to get dial-up access. Broadband was never heard of in this low bandwidth world, so messages had to be brief. Think of how telegrams work today, where there is an incentive to be brief (telegrams charge per word). To that end, we would simply use the letter “Y” instead of typing the entire word “Why”. We used “R U” to shorten the phrase “are you”. These are only a few examples. The drawbacks to this are that people who are not used to it may get confused and wonder if “Y” means “why” or “yes”. It could refer to either of these. It was only after practice and reading for context did people become accustomed to using this new “shorthand” to communicate, but this was only the beginning of the language.<br /><br /><br />“Elite Speak” really took off with the onset of newsgroups. The net was growing, bandwidth was increasing (I was now up to a 900 or 1200 baud modem), and newsgroups (which came about the same time as email using a slightly different protocol) were becoming more popular. Newsgroups allowed people with common interests to have a central area to communicate with one another. In this medium, the same shorthand used in email was perpetuated and expanded. But an additional problem arose. The server administrators felt the need to control the content and censor speech that they found “questionable”. They would regularly filter the database to delete posts containing “objectionable material” just like the content filtering software of today.<br /><br /><br />What this meant was that you either got your messaged deleted by the administrators or you found loopholes to outsmart the filters. That is what hakkerz do. I get a lot of flak from n00bs who don’t understand why I say “Hakkerz” instead of “Hackers”. The reason is simple. Since “hacking” fell under the “objectionable material” category, we had to intentionally misspell the word to avoid getting kill-filed. OK, so they added “hakker” to their filter. But what about “H4ck3r”, “H4kk3r”,”Hax0r”, and so on? We kept adapting the language (and don’t think this is any less of a language than Ebonics) until the censors finally gave up. We could make every word adapt and change to avoid being blocked. It got to the point where we started intentionally misspelling words that didn’t even have the potential to be kill-filed. Words like “Kool” and “rokk” began to be added and it fit with the pattern of our other words while stilling maintaining meaning. Eventually, they realized that it was impossible to block a polymorphic language, and they gave up.<br /><br /><br />The final transformation of the language was built purely on ego! That’s right, there is an aspect of simple ego involved of trying to look “kool”, and it came about mostly on IRC. Those of us who have been online for the genesis of the language communicated like we always had, using the methods mentioned above. It was mostly out of sheer habit. This led to inevitable questions from n00bie Hax0rs and non-hakkerz alike asking why we “can’t spell” and asking what we were trying to say. Nubies picked up on the language, but they began to pervert it. Because we used words like “h4kk3r” which used both letters and numbers in it, it made the word appear to be in mIXeD CasE (because using a fixed font, numbers are generally bigger than letters). This caused many people to start using “mIx3d c4Se” just for the sake of making words look like the traditional “elite speak”. Quite frankly, it did look kind of kool (when not used to excess)!<br /><br /><br />So with all of these things creating and modifying the language, you can see why we have such a beast. It grew out of necessity. The new generations of hakkerz pick up and learn the language as it is today, but they don’t always understand and appreciate its roots. Hopefully now they understand the history and the beauty of the language.<br /><br /><br />Where does it go from here? This is an ever-evolving language! It is, by no means, set in stone. Currently, it is accounting for multiple languages (Spanish, “Spanglish”, Portuguese, etc…), adding current slang speaking terms (“wasssssup”, “pissed”,etc…), and remnants from many other languages. The most complex addition is the integration of actual source code and symbolism into the language. In the beginning of this article I said that the World Wide Web is not the same as the Internet. More than likely, had we been talking online, I would have said “WWW != Internet” just like I always say that “Hakkerz != Criminals”. Hopefully, with all of this newfound history, you will not only understand the language, but you will also appreciate it, and use your new power isely. Use it with other hakkerz, but don’t annoy people who don’t or can’t understand it. 0n1y t#en ‘//!ll j00 +ruly b ‘1337!</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Some of his other work can be found here:<br /><a href="http://binrev.com/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://binrev.com/</a><br /><a href="http://www.docdroppers.org/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.docdroppers.org/</a><br /><a href="http://www.stankdawg.com/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.stankdawg.com/</a></div>

&nbsp;Post subject: More on this... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reply with quote Edit/Delete this post Delete this post<br />Monday, November 07th 2005 1200 hours will see the kick-off of a series (if the gods are willing) of weekly events centering around the free (in both senses of the word) information that is available about technology and the culture of technology.<br />&lt;BR&gt;(in this particular case, PoDcasts)<br /><br />The original idea was started by Windowsrefund when he attempted to spark interest by gathering an audience together at the Peach to listen to the Massachusetts hearing on OpenDocument Format which was considerately downloaded, burned &amp; supplied by CritterNYC who was currently working on a project called Portable Firefox at the time. I guess alot of the people coming into the cafe&#039; didn&#039;t realize what was going on hence the idea of introducing a large sandwich Smile It was originally going to be 4 feet, then (at the advice of a friend) became 8 feet, but due to the impractical nature of such a large sandwich, I think that we are going to settle for two (2) four (4) foot heroes with the promise of drunken rewards for those of us who delight in such things afterwards (to counteract the healthy nature of the sandwich in the name of Balancing the Equation &lt;/smirk&gt;) The idea was further given the breath of life by Frozenfroot who thought that such an event would be good on a weekly basis. Hopefully Merm will give me a hand with the sandwiches!<br /><br />To tell you the truth though, I am not expecting a large turn-out. It was decided that Monday&#039;s at 12pm is usually was slow time of the week, which is o.k. with me because we will be trying to listen to spoken word with undivided attention anyhow. It doesn&#039;t matter though what the turn out is, it is enough that the event takes place, and that consistently, from week to week, information being exchanged and yet another time-slot in the year where like-minded individuals can find haven. Between the Cons, the various computer clubs and user groups there should be no day in the year where one can&#039;t find or communicate knowledge by speaking to a live individual face-to-face when one needs to get up and away from the computer screen for awhile.<br /><br />I chose Binary Revolution Radio for several reasons. The creator, Stank Dawg is very entertaining in addition to being highly informed. He is 1337 yet not &quot;elitist&quot;. A very down to earth personality who emanates intelligence and humanity; I just like listening to him. I chose this particular episode because I think the science of Cryptology has been getting much attention lately from the general public given the popular craze surrounding books as The DaVinci Code and the success of such movies like Enigma &amp; National Treasure, and the mystery that surrounds and fascinates all who come into knowledge or contact with the sculpture of Kryptos. I also think (on a socially conscious level) that the time is now ripe for people who are concerned about their privacy in their personal day-to-day communications, whether it be by email or videophone to take hold of the reigns of simple technological solutions that are easily within the grasp of every man, woman and child, and to use these tools which is our human birthright to begin laying a sound pavement along the long and glorious road to freedom.<br /><br />Well, anyway, get your pencils and papers ready &amp; here are some sites you might want to have handy in near future...<br /><br /><a href="http://elonka.com/kryptos/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://elonka.com/kryptos/</a><br /><a href="http://www.binrev.com/radio/archive.php?p=5" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.binrev.com/radio/archive.php?p=5</a><br /><a href="http://members.aol.com/nova1337/tutorial.htm" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://members.aol.com/nova1337/tutorial.htm</a><br /><a href="http://www.phreaknic.info/pn9/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.phreaknic.info/pn9/</a><br /><br />What follows is the Phreaknik challenge which Elonka cracked, she uses this code in a tutorial that some of us will be following:<br /><br /><a href="http://members.aol.com/nova1337/phreaknic.txt" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://members.aol.com/nova1337/phreaknic.txt</a><br /><br /><br />Cyrillic Projector<br /><br />OMN1SCAN<br />_________________<br />&quot;Don&#039;t burn the oil wells.&quot; -George W.

This particular cipher is <em>ancient</em> and is still widely used.<br /><br /><strong>Transposition:</strong> When all the information to understanding the message is present but the order is all mixed up. For example, if you write the following encrypted text (&quot;TKIHESEY3&quot;) on a 3x3 grid from left to right (starting at the top) and then you read down, the decrypted result is (&quot;THEKEYIS3&quot;) or &quot;The key is three.&quot;<br /><br /><span style="color: cyan;" class="bbc_color">T K I<br />H E S<br />E Y 3</span><br /><br /><strong>Concealment:</strong> The actual hiding of the text or information. Writing with lemon juice is one example, hiding text within a picture or audio file is another (as is used in steganography). Elonka gave the example of the messenger who had his head shaved and the message tattooed on his head. After waiting for his hair to grow back he was sent across enemy lines (where he was searched and nothing was found) whereupon his head was re-shaved and the message presented to the receiver. In the short story/movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113481/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">Johnny Pneumonic</a> the courier had secret information downloaded into his brain (which had cyber-electronic components surgically implanted). This may seem far-fetched, but the recent advent of nano-technology makes all of this quite plausible and has far reaching implications for concealment type ciphers.<br /><br /><strong>2600 (frquency &amp; Group &amp; Atrai):</strong><br /><br /><strong>Binary:</strong><br /><br /><strong>Hex:</strong><br /><br /><strong>rot13:</strong> If you begin at 'A' and count thirteen letters you end up at 'N'; conversly...

The hacker is usually quite good at his craft, but may very well not be a professional computer programmer or designer. The hacker's work may be useful or may be just a game. As an example of the latter, more than one determined hacker has written a program which, when executed, writes out an exact copy of itself<span style="font-size: 9px;" class="bbc_size">1</span>.

I have more personal reasons as well, having to do with the contsitutional right to privacy: see the P.A.T.R.I.O.T. Act thread (hopefully I have matured a little since beginning that thread).<br /><br />I still only use rudimentary encryption algorithms for my communications (if at all) and the reasons for this, although there are a plethora of open-sourced tools available to me only a small download away are simply ignorance and laziness. Many people avoid using passwords because remembering them is a tiresome task, or typing it in simply takes too long. Now, through the modern miracle of mnemonics I can remember a password 40+ characters long! And so can you! Take this example:<br /><br />&quot;Sometimes I Go To The Refrigerator Very Late At Night To Get A Late Night Snack. Whether I Eat Cheese Or Cereal It Really Makes No Difference Just As Long As I Remember To Brush My Teeth Afterwards Because Tooth-Decay Is An Unpleasant Thing, Just Like Bad Breath.(my phone # with the last two digits changed (and a different area code)&quot;...<br /><br />Renders this relatively secure password: [&quot;SIGTTRVLANTGALNS.WIECOCIRMNDJALAIRTBMTABT-DIAUT,JLBB.(my phone # with the last two digits changed (and a different area code)&quot;] =<br />Sixty-five (65) characters<br /><br />By using numbers and punctuation marks in addition to alphabetic characters you increase the sophistication of the password. Add to this case sensitivity then you may have something very daunting indeed. Of course, the above example may be a little extreme so you'll have to adjust the strength of your passwords for your own needs. You could measure the time taking to type the password in against how much the information you are attempting to protect is worth. But to not use them at all or a password that is easily cracked or guessed (like a pet's name or your favorite food) may not be advisable. I guess, what I'm trying to say is that with a little information, solutions are only a small act of volition away.<br /><br />I hope you will join us this week as we learn how to protect our privacy together and am sure you will see me taking notes.<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Note: I am open to suggestions regarding the nature of the hero or the brunch... it doesn't even have to be a hero. I'm trying to keep it vegetarian however, as I want to try something different and vegetables are for the most part cost effective. Today's hero will be the same as last week, and No, I didn't use the leftovers from last week lol. I will buy the vegetable materials the same day or the night before. The reason that it is the same as last week is due to a lack of imagination and also, I really want to get a handle on the exact amount of goods needed to make this particular hero in order to further my knowledge of this special branch of sandwich technology.<br /><br />As for the programming, I am always looking for new shows to listen to and Tech-Brunch won't be sticking exclusively to Binary Revolution Radio. I am planning a Monday in the future that will have 4 or 5 (10-15) minute shows.<br /><br />Also: If anyone would like to give a talk or a presentation having to do with tech in lieu of the Internet Broadcast please get in touch with me... however, keep in mind that 12pm Monday may not be the most lucrative time. You will have at least two listeners!<br /><br />There is alot of free information out there and I advise everyone to explore on their own so that we may pool together the fruits of our exploration and so be in a position to build a better tommorrow based on information and humanity.<br /><br />-Zeno.<br />_________________<br />&quot;I have known Fear.

You are truly an inspiration &amp; it is only a matter of time before there is a New York panel on <a href="http://www.groklaw.net/articlebasic.php?story=20050926191316526" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><span style="color: black;" class="bbc_color">Open Document Format!</span></a>); SKaReCRoW (whose presence at these events not only helps hold the thing together but educates and inspires as well...I am honored to know you); La Machina (keep coming, there is much to learn!); Frozenfroot (It was you who first said to me that &quot;Linux is the solution&quot;); Merm (I'm still trying ;-)); Doctor Mung Mung and his biblical friend whom I don't have a handle for yet (for an enjoyable evening at Wave); <a href="http://johnhaller.com/jh/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><span style="color: black;" class="bbc_color">CritterNYC</span></a> am enjoying your very small applications :-); JCY for a very pleasant lunch and meaningful discussion at Watana and all the other kind individuals who showed up but whose handles for now escape me.<br /><br /><strong>Logistics:</strong><br />Today we tried something different and I was a little late as a result. Next week I will remember to prep the brunch at least 2 hours early and not procrastinate as much in preparation for the event as well as getting the notes out there <em>post</em> the event.<br /><br />There were not as many people this Monday (it varied from 4 to 9 people) but we are going for consistency here rather than quantity... and quality is always a plus (which excluding my humble self) I believe we have achieved ;-)<br />However, the sooner we get a consistent amount of people showing up in greater numbers (15 or so) then the sooner we can ask people like Elonka, Emmanual Goldstein or Bernie S. to show up and give a presentation.<br /><br />Some of the questions that were raised was: &quot;Where do I learn to hack?&quot; and not having earned that title myself I can only direct the curious to go to the source and ask the hackers themselves. 2600 meetings are a start and there is more than enough information on the Net. I'll relist some of the links below. In future we will listen to more shows geared towards the aspiring hacker but until then these shows I have found useful [...] and of course the erudite Jargon File is a great launching point to computer hacking culture. Of course anything to do with technology, be it automechanics to music can also be a good place to start. Public libraries are also a great source for access to materials that would normally cost a small fortune. I definitely recommend textfiles.com and a perusal of their audio archives.<br /><br />Another question was &quot;How many times to you have to listen to a show until you can have an understanding of the material?&quot;, to which I answered that &quot;It depends on the material as well as whether I'm taking notes or not, but generally three or four times.&quot; Paying close attention also helps but many times I have shows going on in the background while I'm doing something else, so I pick up snippets of information here and there while I'm working or otherwise preoccupied.<br /><br />Another question concerned shortwave radio, for which there is already a group at the Freezepeach that is studying for the various licenses. I direct the curious to ARRL's <a href="http://www.arrl.org/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">website</a> (American Radio Relay League) which is actually the National Association for Amateur Radio.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 9px;" class="bbc_size">Schrödinger's Wraps<br />(2pks.)Flour Tortillas (toasted slightly in frying pan);

Your definition of hackerdom is worth more than its weight in gold... I am continually inspired. Follow your True Course, it is redemption for El Mundo ; XlogicX, for joining the forums and... opening the door to...well... Logic (read Logos); Jayme (who is a light in an otherwise cloud covered day); Frozenfroot (without whose support this brunch would not be possible and for continually getting me to Think &amp; whose focus on Libertarianism and Equality remains as constant as a L.A.S.E.R.); Merm, whose friendship and caring might just possibly keep me alive a bit more longer than necessary ;-); Green Circus, for not only the great music but for posing a solution to a problem that affects even CEOs of evil mega-corporations... check them out!; Jh. for showing up again...albeit a little bit late :-) (You can always refer to the writeups and links... but it would be nice if you furnished me with a handle :-)); to One who showed up, showed interest (which is inspiring to me) but whose name I didn't obtain (talk to me next time!); &amp; last but not least Dm. who once posed a question which made me evaluate if Love really existed in this distracted and perhaps robotized heart. I seek to know you better. Shouts all... you are keeping me alive.<br /><br /><strong>Logistics &amp; Random Notes:</strong><br />Today was more entertaining to the audience than I had predicted. Personally, I can't get enough of this stuff. Whenever I come across a con (whether fictional or not, whether successful or not) I feel that my knowledge of psychology has broadened. It's as if a window has been opened on a certain aspect of human nature and as a result may even make me personally a little more resilient.<br /><br />This is a very controversial subject and needs to have a more in-depth debate.<br />One point was made that a possible detrimental effect of alot of people practicing SE was to initiate even further control, procedures and restrictions. Paranoia might become even more in fashion and simple human interactions could break down. While I didn't see an easy answer to this another point was made that when a corporation or governmental body allows information to be compromised then personal privacy suffers as a result. Someone pointed out that companies simply need to train their employees better and should actually know the equipment that they are using. But wouldn't that mean that trained employees would be worth more money and not as expendable?<br /><br />Earlier (during the show) someone mentioned a recent break in Experian's security which I still have to look up &amp; post some links.<br />Some of the later discussion involved how to get started in coding. It was suggested to me that I learn how to use a text editor such as emacs or vi. I confessed that I still haven't learned to touch-type &lt;embarassed&gt; Emulation. The 'folding' function in vi. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_dialing" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">Pulse dialing</a>.

It seems that Time is the overriding concern no matter what we do. Thankfully their are people working on that problem as well.<br /><br />I really think that this is one of my most favorite of the &quot;fun&quot; binrev episodes... something about Lucky&#39;s sketch on Tr0n sticks in my head and this also had the effect of encouraging me in my addiction to the web tv series &quot;The.Scene&quot; and it&#39;s attendant parody &quot;Teh.Scene&quot; which I sincerely recommend everybody to watch. I found &quot;Teh.Scene&quot; very very funny. While the show may or may not be an accurate portrayal of the software piracy scene, it is a highly original creation of alternative media... and yes there <em>is</em> non-content-free information to be found in it. Unfortunately it has the unfortunate reputation of being torn apart by critics... who may or may not be creative themselves. Also, I can listen to Stank&#39;s screaming rants again and again without them <em>ever</em> getting old... and add comuniques from SystemSh0xxx0r! into the mix and you have a <span class="bbc_u">perfect</span> show!<br /><br />I honestly believe that the number to call for ANI is 958... but not having a landline (for all you passive fingerprinters out there :-)) I find this difficult to test out. I feel kind of weird asking my friends to call this number... but I have a feeling I&#39;ll soon get over this weirdness. To add to the dilemma, I still don&#39;t know whether this still applies to payphones (easy enough to find out) and COCOTS (Customer-owned coin-operated telephone system) are said not to work at all being that they are not using the same system as the IBX (Incumbent service provider)[ later: sorry, I don&#39;t think that IBX is a term at all... I was probably thinking of ILECs (Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier)]; and VOIP is right out highly problematical. [later...] O.K., I have a confirm.. 958 does indeed work (afaik) on <a href="http://[color=black" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">Verizown[/color]]<span style="color: black;" class="bbc_color">Verizown</span></a> payphones.<br /><br />As a side note, I met yet <em>another</em> individual who thought that the definition of hacking was breaking into people&#39;s computers, case closed. O.K., security penetration <em>is</em> a subset of hacking, but to say that this is what defines hacking is not only assinine but ridiculous (did that make sense?) This is like saying that the field of Biology is restricted to the study of swans. I sincerely believe that the majority of the hackers out there that actually do penetration testing and bypass security systems do so out of boredom, curiosity as a sort of <em>game</em> in their off-time! Most of the hackers that I&#39;ve met look on this practice as a non-serious diversion likened to playing Klondite solitaire that most people &amp; office workers are all too familiar with. And God forbid that they actually <em>alert</em> the companies in question of a security hole which if exploited for criminal ends could have disasterous consequences. Despite the Draconian punishments that await such people many hackers do in fact try to be helpful in the interest of the public good,&nbsp; often with disasterous consequences to themselves. On their &quot;on-time&quot; they are writing useful applications, building the internet, innovating or inventing new hardware, or even doing security and penetration testing for their employers!...iow pushing foward the Technological Age and reaching out and improving their Communities...iow Helping people, which is more than I can say for soulless companies such as Microsoft, Verizon, Time-Warner or Burger King.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/gba.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">The Word Hacker</a> by Paul Graham<br /><br />Watch the video put out by &quot;Hippies From Hell&quot; where they show someone making a keyboard out of pebbles and stones at a Hacker conference and tell me What has this to do with &quot;breaking into people&#39;s computers&quot;. Newsflash: Hackers are Not at All interested in your data or what you wrote in your email. These gals and guys are easily bored with even exciting things! The only people who <em>do</em> care are corporations and the Government, the prior to sell you something, the latter to control you, to paraphrase d3c0d3r. The difference is that these corp.govs don&#39;t need to <em>break</em> into your computer... they have already been invited!<br />A good question to point out at this juncture is &quot;Where does Spam come from?&quot; If you answer this question correctly then you are well on your way to seeing through the illusion of consensus reality which is the Matrix.<br /><br />Another thing that I find humorous is that hackers are notorious for <em>hating</em> the Windows/Mac environments. They love the Linuxes &amp; the BSDs.<br />So why in the <em>hell</em> would they want to take over your Windows machine?<br />Perhaps to torture themselves? :-)<br />Media tells us one thing... History teaches us another. Look To Your History!&lt;/rant&gt; :-)<br /><br />As far as Tech-Brunch, there is a possible presentation coming soon (it will be our first) although perhaps it will have to be a Tech-Dinner or Dessert. Keep your ear to the ground!<br /><br />Also, rumor has it that there is another Hacker Conference in the works, and the prospects for this are very exciting indeed.

I look at this as a good thing, however as it is exposing us to some of the great culinary institutions as well as the great people in the neighborhood. This is precious.</span><br /><br />Hi all in Internet TV Land!<br />This week was very stimulating and the energy levels were up there between clouds 7 and 8 and at brief moments were spiking towards the Holy Nine. I can honestly say that listening to BaseNet or talking with the creators usually has this effect on me and I don't think I'm alone. &nbsp;Many people don't know that the crew at BaseNet are actually highly politically and socially oriented and yet do a very good job at keeping it to a minimum on their show... which may (Destiny willing) soon be remedied by <em>another</em> show devoted to this sad yet necessary topic exclusively... let us hope that they go through with it. Maybe their unending humor will bleed over into such a show as well and inspire us to think our ways out of such morasses and concrete rooms as we find ourselves at present in a positive and thoughtful manner. I don't doubt it for a second. This group definitely jokes around alot and continually claims their show as A.D.D. Compliant and yet at the same time, IMHO they are also some of the most down to earth people that I know who <em>know</em> what &quot;the deal&quot; is; shattering the sacrosanct Prism of Occlusion that blinds us with pretty illusions, phantasms of ignorance, oligarchical deceptions; solving problems, in a way that is both peaceful, egalitarian and noble...i.e. truly educating. And don't get me wrong... I don't think they're doing this because they have some Grand Mission... they're doing this because they enjoy it!<br />Again, let's give them our support... they deserve it.<br /><br />At the brunch a new [to us] method of hacking the polaroid picture was employed. Whenever you take one and it begins to develop, just draw on it with a stylus and according to the pressure that you apply you get variations in thickness as well as color superimposed upon the captured image. This is because of the fluid that resides within the photograph which eventually dries... and that's really all I know about the logistics behind that. We thought that a new genre of art could be created from this given the time-critical nature of drawing on a polaroid before it dries. We also came up with a name for one of the snacks served at the Freeze... namely the &quot;Hacking Isaac's Newton&quot; which was bravely modeled by SKaReCRoW. At one point we had four people working on this title, including the author of &quot;The Bad Catholic's Guide to Good Living&quot;, JPZmirak. Let's just say that we had a ball naming the &quot;fig&quot; dish.<br /><br />After the meeting SKaReCRoW and I had some fun with the local Verizon and COCOTs in the neighborhood... always being careful not to harm these precious artifacts or break any laws of course, and I think that SKaReCRoW found some interesting avenues to explore. Next time I'd like to bring along a digital recorder to capture some of the interesting sounds that we heard as well as capturing the rocket take-off effect of the Freeze's Expresso machine. Speaking of the Peach, we also need someone to contribute a stamp for the cup of the U.S.A. P.A.T.R.I.O.T. Missile Large Americano heavily caffeinated beverage. :-)<br /><br />Well, I guess I got to apologize for the delay the last few weeks (and this week) for the approriate links and T.O.M.s... I haven't forgotten about them you know. But looking back over the past six weeks (it's hard to believe how time flies) I'm under the impression that I'm getting a type of handle on this kind of thing and perhaps am improving (albeit sluggishly) with age. Please remember, that the Brunch is a humble endeavor but has the potential to be much more... I think that it is it's humility that protects it from attempting to be something grandiose that it is not.<br /><br />Food.<br />Information.<br /><em>(FoodInformation &lt;NewSpeak)</em><br /><br />Everything else that follows (and things already have) are added blessings that breathe in Life nourishing mana flowing in like River Nile. Again, in this humble project, consistency is king, which means basically at the very least rolling out of bed in the morning and if too lazy to cook then buying a bag of bagels &lt;smirk&gt;.<br />And as far as Content?... well, that's easy... the people creating these radio shows have already done the hard work for us.<br /><br />Humbly,<br />zen/CF SubcorticalAI operating system architecure No.00009 v12.0 Beta<br /><br /><br /><strong>Linksys:</strong><br /><br /><a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1149.txt" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1149.txt</a><br /><br /><strong>Books, Magazines, Manuals &amp; other Media:</strong><br /><br />Powers of Ten<br /><br /><strong><a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/index.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><span style="color: black;" class="bbc_color">T.O.M.s</span></a> (<em>Terminological Offensive Maneuvers</em>):</strong><br /><br /><strong><em>Projects...</em></strong><br /><br /><strong>Pong update:</strong><br /><strong><em><span style="color: red;" class="bbc_color">M</span><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">K</span><span style="color: yellow;" class="bbc_color">-</span><span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color">U</span><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">l</span><span style="color: indigo;" class="bbc_color">t</span><span style="color: violet;" class="bbc_color">r</span><span style="color: red;" class="bbc_color">a</span> <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color">Pong</span></em></strong> is <em>temporarily</em> on hold.
