				Should I make the post a little more political?? <br /><br />I think the fact that it&#039;s been moved to Business Services and Services Directory is interesting. <br /><br />Are the posts about the Jackson Heights Board also in the business services and Services Directory section. <br /><br />Interesting. <br /><br />a form of Censorship??<br /><br />you decide

				Interesting site.&nbsp; Similar site, just more posts about politics.&nbsp; Even some of the topics are the same.&nbsp; (Everyone loves brunch in Astoria)&nbsp; That&#039;s cool.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think moving this post to the appropriate category is censorship.&nbsp; It still shows up in my unread posts and I&#039;m still reading it.&nbsp; It&#039;s just in the right category now.&nbsp; If not pointed out, I would never have noticed anyhow.&nbsp; The Jackson Hts post was under board announcements, because it was a board announcement regarding the announcement of Astorian&#039;s sister site.&nbsp; That&#039;s filed appropriately too.&nbsp; I like having more choices to read more about what&#039;s going on in Astoria.&nbsp; I don&#039;t like debating politics so I won&#039;t respond or read those posts, but I&#039;ll end up reading both sites for their informational value regarding Astoria.&nbsp; So, best wishes to both!

				Speaking of Politics Without Censors, you&#039;ll notice that any post on Astorians.com that links to A s t o r i a l o g u e s . c o m is now broken. That&#039;s because the Admin of this site has made Astorialogues a &quot;bad word&quot; that is automatically replaced with &quot;astorialogues&quot;. Notice the missing &quot;u&quot;?

If you wouldn&#039;t mind sharing here or perhaps via private message, I&#039;d be appreciative.&nbsp; <br /><br />On the topic of this strange, targeted crippling of links to the other forum, I too would be curious about &quot;the thinking behind this action.&quot; Turns out that if you go to your Profile and check the box for &quot;Leave words uncensored.&quot;, then astorialogues appears as it should. Meaning that astorialogues is a censored word? Wow.<br />

				Dear Board Admin,<br /><br />I am writing to you to ask that you please undo the &quot;censored word&quot; status that you&#039;ve applied to my Astorian-based web site. For the vast majority of users on your site who will not check the box next to &quot;Leave words uncensored&quot; (which defaults as unchecked in their User Profile), any link to my site is broken by your decision to have your site&#039;s censored word filter respell it incorrectly. For clarity&#039;s sake, astorialogues.com appears without the &quot;u&quot; unless that box is checked. Most people would not think that astorialogues is or should be a censored word. <br /><br />I hope you will reconsider your decision to do this. You are fostering the false impression that my site does not exist under false pretenses (ie, by intervening to misspell its name). You placed reference to my site in the Business and Services area of your web site. I&#039;d ask that you afford it the same, bare minimum of respect that you would afford any other business and/or service based in Astoria (ie, please don&#039;t censor the name of my site).<br /><br />Thank you for your time and consideration.<br /><br />Adam<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				To be honest, my impression with astorialogues is that it&#039;s more for people interested in politics and specifically libertarian politics.&nbsp; I disagree with the majority of the viewpoints expressed but as I don&#039;t care to argue or get stressed out by arguing my case, I don&#039;t bother myself with the site.&nbsp; As far as site functionality, things could be better.&nbsp; Clicking on a link takes you to the first page of the topic, instead of the last post of it.&nbsp; It could use a view unread threads option, as the same posts appear under view new posts, even if you&#039;ve read them already.&nbsp; But these are minor gripes, and really just my opinion, which is based entirely upon my interests and sensibilities.&nbsp; I see absolutely no reason references to the site should be altered.&nbsp; I get that there&#039;s a rift on the board.&nbsp; I try not to get into those things and use this board for its informational purposes only.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure many do so as well.&nbsp; And I&#039;m sure there are plenty who enjoy the other site as well.

As a forum software neophyte, I&#039;m still piecing things together. The view unread posts option is something I&#039;d love to add as soon as I find a reliable implementation of it. As the community at astorialogues grows, I&#039;ll be looking into gathering user interface requests and improving the site&#039;s look, too. <br /><br />Although there are some libertarians there (full disclosure, I&#039;m one), most of the registered users aren&#039;t, and the debates, for those who are interested in engaging in them, have been pretty great. If that&#039;s not your cup of tea, the other big focus over there is food (buying it, preparing it, eating it, and eating out). You&#039;re right that there are more threads dealing with current events and politics and public policy stuff than most anything else. That said, the forum does offer options for the full range of conversations, much like astorians, just with a different administrative approach and, admittedly, a smaller group (we&#039;re still taking off the gift-wrapping).<br /><br />Thanks again for the feedback, daisy, and for supporting the idea that astorialogues shouldn&#039;t be a censored word.

				Actually I&#039;m surprised that shithead.com gets through the filter but astorialoges doesn&#039;t... hmm.<br /><br />I just added astorialoges to the filter for fun the other day when the thread got bumped (again) by someone who is trying to drive traffic to the site. It was a little tit-for-tat bumping is all, maybe distasteful - but not meant to be harmful.<br /><br />For the record, I think it&#039;s great there&#039;s another Astoria site out there. Just wish that we didn&#039;t need to re-bump this thread to build traffic over there. It&#039;s sort of annoying (kinda like broken links maybe?). :)

				Oh come on. It&#039;s bad enough that you sent this thread to the Businesses &amp; Services directory after it was posted, but you&#039;d go so far as to suspend the person who tries to bring attention to the board merely by bumping this thread? Then you add their name to the censored words list so anyone who clicks on it gets sent to a broken page. I&#039;m fairly certain you wouldn&#039;t treat any other local business or service as terribly as you&#039;re treating astorialog-ues. If deleting the post, suspending the poster, and then censoring the site&#039;s name is not meant to be harmful, what was it meant to be?

				Historically other websites that use Astorians to build their traffic by linking are moved to the Business Listings section because it&#039;s the most appropriate section for those links to reside. These are in effect classified ads, that are &quot;marketing&quot; something. In this case the OP is one of the founding members of that site. And in the case of the duplicate posting (bump) - were it not that person&#039;s 3rd suspension I&#039;d have just given them a friendly warning.<br /><br />In some other cases the posts are removed entirely, but I didn&#039;t think that was necessary since I&#039;m actually glad the site exists. I was just annoyed that the thread was bumped more than once. I thought it was a harmless way to annoy the &quot;bumper&quot;.<br /><br />My personal feeling is that there&#039;s enough room in our neighborhood for more than one site. I welcome it and harbor no ill-will. By the same token though I expect that when users promote that site that they&#039;ll at least respect our rules and not just continually repost the same thing to rise to the top of the thread list inorganically. That&#039;s all.<br /><br />I sincerely apologize if it upset anyone - I really did just do it to annoy the bumper, not to do the site a disservice.

I just came across your post in the board announcements category and have merged your request with this thread. I think by now you&#039;ve probably read my explanation for why &quot;u&quot; were (was) missing in the link. It seems you have a few users that want to keep bumping this thread in order to promote your site. After removing the duplicate post a second time I found this a little annoying and responded yesterday by removing the &quot;u&quot;. It wasn&#039;t meant in any harmful way. I apologize in that it seems to have sent the wrong message to you and your users.<br /><br />I&#039;ve already stated, but will do so again that I only wish you and your new site the best. I harbor no ill will towards the site you&#039;ve started or the opinions expressed on it. Astoria is certainly big enough for both our sites to exist side by side.<br /><br />I do ask though that you encourage your users if possible to just try and respect the decorum we have here at Astorians.<br /><br />I wish you and your group only the best in your new endeavor.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />merm<br /><br />P.S. Merging a topic makes the &quot;nods&quot; for the merged post disappear. This is a bug I haven&#039;t yet figured out how to fix. Nothing intentional in the missing nods (which were +8 when I merged it).

				Interestingly Merm&#039;s maneuver has increased awareness of the other site and probably traffic also.&nbsp; The discussion of the missing &quot;u&quot; keeps the thread active.&nbsp; So, maybe Merm and Adam are in cahoots&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />

				Stewart, I fully realize the wrong message it sent. Also, I&#039;ve apologized for that. My intention wasn&#039;t to stop driving traffic to the site, but rather than keep removing the post of the &quot;bumper&quot; to make the link temporarily not work for them. In short I was annoyed and made a bad call. I genuinely feel bad that some took it like I meant harm towards the site. This couldn&#039;t be further from the truth, and any of my friends can vouch for that.<br /><br />Generally, I sincerely have nothing against astorialogues as a whole, just people who keep bumping posts is all. The existence of this thread I hope shows that I have no objection to the link - just felt it was overtly promotional by someone I perceived as a founder of the new site (apparently I was wrong, my &quot;research&quot; on these kind of things isn&#039;t really scientific. I generally try and get a sense for if something is self-promotion, or a genuine endorsement of a business by a third party).<br /><br />In sum, I&#039;ve never had a problem with the site, and I greatly respect what Adam and his team is trying to do (as I&#039;ve done it myself and it&#039;s a lot more difficult than it would appear). I fully endorse the site, and their proposed ideal of &quot;free speech&quot; that they are striving for - it&#039;s not unlike the ideals I had for Astorians when I first launched it. I&#039;ve since discovered that I don&#039;t indeed believe in <em>completely</em> free speech for a variety of reasons, and after much discussion with others rules were created to create a framework for the dialog on this site. While it&#039;s been bumpy, I believe it&#039;s largely been a success given the diversity of the crowd both here, and in our neighborhood. In no way do I think Astorians represents the ideal however. <br /><br />Speech is a messy thing, and this site (as do I) remain a work in progress (current example notwithstanding).

				Please read my message again. It has nothing to do with Adam or another website. I don&#039;t care what you think about another site. I don&#039;t mind if you suspend users. I don&#039;t mind if you delete offensive or repetitive posts. I don&#039;t mind if you redact things that violate whatever standards you care to apply.<br /><br />I object to changing posts from what the original poster wrote without indicating that you made such a change. This isn&#039;t an issue of free-speech, but one of trust. <br /><br />There in no need for you to apologize for what I may have thought, or others may have thought. Leave that sort of apology to the political professionals.
