			When you run a pizza joint on the corner of the busiest intersection in town you inevitably become something of a neighborhood institution... every Friday evening starting at 7:00pm the Pizza Palace gives back to the community of Astoria by sponsoring a live streetside concert on the corner of Ditmars Boulevard and 31st St.<br /><br /><br /><br />Come out as long as the weather permits and dance the evening away to the lighthearted folksy-rock-and-roll-traditional performance by local artist Tommy Kelly.
