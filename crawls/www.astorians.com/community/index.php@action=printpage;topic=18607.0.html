				The garbage in Astoria Park is out of control. I walk their weekend mornings with my son and it&#039;s disgusting--garbage strewn everywhere. I find myself picking things up and throwing them out myself. Does anyone know when the park is regularly cleaned? I know the city is strapped for cash and park maintenance is taking a hit, but there&#039;s no reason for our park to look the way it does. It makes me sad.

				I suspect that will happen today, what with the start of the regular work week.&nbsp; Trash piles up quick on summer weekends, especially hot ones.<br /><br />I am still trying to figure out what the deal is with playground restrooms.&nbsp; Sometimes they are open.&nbsp; Sometimes they are closed.&nbsp; There seems to be no rhyme or reason, just totally random...which can be interesting when one has a three year old. :cry: :cry:

				Yeah, the trash is a huge eyesore as is the constant smell of s___ (please excuse the french) wafting in across it as you run.&nbsp; While I love the view from the river while I run and it&#039;s better than being a hamster in the gym on a treadmill, the smell and garbage are really wearing on me :(&nbsp;

				I was off 2 weeks ago and took my kids to the park a couple of times in the afternoons.&nbsp; Each day there was a parks department crew picking up trash.<br /><br />Astoria park could use some more garbage cans, but people are slobs.&nbsp; We shouldn&#039;t be relying on the city to keep our parks clean.&nbsp; The people that use them should be doing that.&nbsp; If there&#039;s no garbage can or if they are full, take your trash home and throw it out.<br /><br />People are generally inconsiderate slobs.&nbsp; It&#039;s the same reason that we can&#039;t have a clean subway system.

				The bathrooms by the track are open til 8pm.&nbsp; I know because we were in the park after 8 for a nice walk and it was still light out, the track was crowded with soccer players and runners, and yet the stupid bathrooms were locked.&nbsp; &nbsp;Good think I didn&#039;t need to go badly but let&#039;s just say some plants got a little watering by a few people.<br /><br />And yes, people are huge slobs.&nbsp; I see it everyday.&nbsp; The garbage has more to do with people being slobs than the lack of garbage pickups.

				Glad this subject came up.&nbsp; This is the letter I sent out last week:<br /><br />To:<br />Queens Borough President Helen M. Marshall<br />Council Member Peter F. Vallone<br />Commissioner Adrian Benepe<br />Deputy Commissioner Therese Braddick<br />Queens Borough Commissioner Dorothy Lewandowski<br /><br />I would like to begin this letter by stating that as a resident who lives in the vicinity of Astoria Park, I was against the concept of a skateboard park from the beginning.&nbsp; At this point, it is well on the way to becoming a reality and I am resigned to the fact that those of us who live in the area will have to find a way to deal with the noise and the crowds it will bring.&nbsp; Overall, I do agree with Council Member Vallone that the idea of a place for kids to practice their skills and have fun is a good one.&nbsp; <br /><br />We have other problems to contend with however; as summer approaches once again we are astounded to find our park full of trash and overflowing trash cans.&nbsp; Memorial Day weekend was gruesome.&nbsp; There was trash everywhere.&nbsp; Imagine what the Fourth of July will bring.&nbsp; <br /><br />Simply put, it is amazing that so much money is being spent on another venue in Astoria Park which will bring more crowds and more trash at a time where it is obvious that the Parks Department is not capable of keeping up with the current trash problem.<br /><br />Capital Expenditure Budget vs. Operations Budget is irrelevant to the residents of Astoria.&nbsp; What we see is that a very expensive venue is being built and yet there are not enough trash cans, not enough staff and not enough trash pick-ups.<br /><br />It is nice that your names are being memorialized at this skate park but it would be nicer if the park was cleaner.&nbsp; The bottom line is that if the Parks Department can afford to build the skateboard park, you can afford to keep the park clean.&nbsp; Please do not send a letter explaining how your budget has been cut.&nbsp; In good years and in bad, the park is overwhelmed with litter during the summer months.&nbsp; Also, to add salt to the wound, it is embarrassing to see so much money and work put into the new venue while noticing all the litter and lack of trash cans.<br /><br />I personally spend a lot of time cleaning up the small field across the street from my house.&nbsp; Right now, I fill two large trash bags daily.&nbsp; As soon as the pool opens, I will need to use four or five trash bags every day.<br /><br />Finally, the park gates are in a terrible state.&nbsp; The gates that run between the Parking Lot and 24th Avenue were stripped by park staff but no one has appeared to paint them, so now they are down to the original metal without any paint!<br /><br />Surely, the park will be made spotless for the grand opening ceremony of the skateboard park.&nbsp; You will all stand proudly for the photographers and local press.&nbsp; The reality is however that the park is filthy in the summer.&nbsp; Our team will be documenting and photographing the situation so that we too can present our case to the local media during whatever ceremony occurs in the fall.<br /><br />Please do something about this before the pool opens – we need more trash cans, more staff and more trash pick-ups.&nbsp; And, before you say ‘we can’t afford it’, just remember that your names are going to be engraved somewhere in that very costly skateboard park!<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />

				Great Job Debbie. <br /><br />- I hate to say it, but the tons of illegal mexican families DO NOT CLEAN UP AFTER THEMSELVES. Our city doesn&#039;t know these people &quot;exist&quot;, so they don&#039;t prepare for their garbage, sewage, and transportation needs. Us tax paying citizens are once again caught paying more, and having less. But I guess what i just wrote is racist right? Nope, its factual. People need to stop being so scared to offend people.

				Thank you, Debbie! That&#039;s a great letter and I hope it will get the attention it deserves. I had heard about the skate park, but wasn&#039;t aware it was opening in the fall. <br /><br />It&#039;s people like you that inspire me to do more. It&#039;s crazy that one person should have to fill two to five bags of trash on her own. It&#039;s really up to us as a community to keep our park clean. I know the Astoria Park Alliance is doing great things toward that end and that&#039;s something I would like to be involved in. Imagine if every one of us who came into the park picked up just one piece of trash? That would make a huge difference! I&#039;ll see you out there with a trash bag. <br />

Racist and factual are not two related terms. Factual would indicate that you could back up your statement with data and supportive evidence, whereas racism just indicates that you assign a particular notion to an ethnic group. What you said was, in fact, racist by pure definition. <br />This is the United States of America, please learn English if you&#039;re going to live here. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=18607.msg198013#msg198013">Quote from: LeavingSoon on June 22, 2010, 01:53:23 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Didn&#039;t realize this was being run like a Nazi regime.

				<em>People are generally inconsiderate slobs.&nbsp; It&#039;s the same reason that we can&#039;t have a clean subway system</em><br /><br />They&#039;re the &quot;trashy&quot; people. They like to believe that by throwing their trash all over the place, they&#039;re providing work for the prisoners who are forced to clean it up. Easier for them to justify their laziness by thinking up erroneous stories.<br /><br />All kids should take courses in outdoor education in place of gym classes, at least for one year. Then, maybe they&#039;d learn the importance of &quot;pack out what you pack in.&quot; Maybe they&#039;d even learn to go a few hours without eating snacks!!&nbsp; :-o<br /><br />As for the skate park: One of the most frequently-requested features in the parks has been skateboard plazas (I used to respond to the letters as part of my job.) Skateboarders are a passionate group, and I&#039;m all for giving them places to practice- it&#039;s healthy, physical exercise, even with the risks of falling down. The one in Astoria won&#039;t have any features over 3&#039; high, and when not in use, will provide a great seating area/vantage point overlooking the river.
