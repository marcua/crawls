				Thanks for the kind words. &nbsp;It was like 75% my fault and 25% the dregs of society.<br /><br />When the weather is nice I like to leave my bike locked up in my front yard, which never was a problem before. &nbsp;I live in a quiet residential street and its not real high traffic. &nbsp;Got lazy the last time I locked it up and only used my u-lock to lock the front wheel to the fence in the yard and left my chain lock hanging on the handlebars, which is where I leave it when I ride. &nbsp;I guess I never figured someone would just walk into my bldg&#039;s yard and yoink it, but I was wrong. &nbsp;They must have come along and removed the wheel from the fork, then pulled the fork up out of the u-lock, which was also my fault b/c I usually use the chain to lock the bike to something via the back wheel and then use the u-lock to lock the front wheel to the frame. &nbsp;Had I used the chain as well as the u-lock like I usually do, I&#039;m sure it wouldn&#039;t have happened. &nbsp;So it&#039;s extra frustrating b/c I could have easily prevented it by spending a extra minute before going inside. &nbsp;And since I got it used I never bothered to write down the registration number, although the cops don&#039;t actually go looking for lost bikes, so I don&#039;t even have that. &nbsp;I was so frustrated and stunned, I think I stared at the lonely wheel for a minute before unlocking it. &nbsp;<br /><br />So the lesson here is always make sure you lock your bike up completely, even at place that you feel is safe.<br /><br />On the bright side I still have the u-lock and now I have a spare wheel.<br /><br />Oh and its a Trek hybrid (forgot the exact model) with a chipped orange paint job, but I don&#039;t imagine it&#039;ll turn up.

				Heff, so sorry to hear it! If you bring or send us a descriptions of the bike (w/ a photo if you have one), we&#039;ll be glad to post it in the shop in case anyone&#039;s seen it around. <br /><br />Filing a police report is of course a good idea, even if you didn&#039;t have id on it. FYI, the 114th precinct does offer &quot;bike registration&quot;--they&#039;ll engrave an id # on your bike and keep a record of it in case it&#039;s ever stolen and recovered.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				You would go to the precinct where it was jacked (I believe) and file the report. It&#039;s a minor hassle but if you have the time, do it for the sake of the statistics. <br /><br />Might not hurt to alert local bike shops just in case somebody brings it in. An orange hybrid Trek isn&#039;t so hard to remember.<br /><br />At least you have the lock/spare wheel. When my Trek got stolen, it had a complete repair kit, new pump, AND the lock vanished along with the entire thing.&nbsp; :x

				As far as locking goes, in NYC is it safe to remove the front wheel and lock it to the back wheel, frame, and post/U-Rack/whathaveyou with a U-Lock but without a big chain?&nbsp; Or is the big chain no matter what, a necessity?

				I have always bought Kryptonite u-locks.&nbsp; They were an excellent investment, and yes, about as much as I paid for my last bike.&nbsp; When I lived in Berkeley, there were a rash of thefts of bikes that used the &quot;wide&quot; u-lock.&nbsp; Thieves were able to fit a small car jack between the two posts of the u-lock and jack it apart.&nbsp; Crazy.&nbsp; That&#039;s when we were advised to buy the &quot;narrow&quot; u-locks, and do the lock-front-wheel-to-back-wheel-to-post kind of locking.&nbsp; I never had a bike stolen that way.&nbsp; But this is NYC and everything is different!<br /><br />Used to be that you could unlock a u-lock with a ballpoint pen.&nbsp; Thank goodness the Kryptonite people learned how to make locks that foiled that.<br /><br />The return policy on Kryptonite locks is sweet, too.

				Heff, I feel yer pain. If anyone&#039;s been following the &quot;Bike shop in Astoria?&quot; thread, you may have read that I recently bought a new bike from Tony&#039;s Bicycles. It&#039;s a Trek hybrid (not orange, though!) and is the mirror image of my previously <strong>stolen</strong> Gary Fisher Tiburon hybrid, which had cost me about $400 bucks. I can&#039;t tell you how upset I was to find that it had been stolen out of the locked basement in my old building in Manhattan. I was the dumbass in this situation, having locked the bike to itself and not the bike rack. I used a square-link chain with an American city gate lock run through both front wheel and frame, but someone just picked it up and carried it off to where they could leisurely work on the chain or lock with the power tools needed to cut through. The moral of this story: Don&#039;t relax for a second in this city. Lock your sh!t down like it was the last bike on earth and then, perhaps, you will still have one to ride when you come back to it. Oh, and go to Tony&#039;s and have them chain your seat. That&#039;s the first thing that goes--even in broad daylight.
