				Interested but worried about the stink factor.&nbsp; Would they cover outdoor composting too?<br /><br />Question:&nbsp; Why indoors?&nbsp; If you have no outdoor garden why compost at all? Just asking

				From what I remember reading about indoor composting (when I had a garden), if the balance of dirt + garbage + worms + newspaper (a good compost starter) is right, it shouldn&#39;t be smelly.<br /><br />I have no garden anymore though so I don&#39;t compost.<br /><br />But hey, if you need some help in the garden, I really like the pre-planting post-winter cleanup part.&nbsp; Playing in the dirt!

				I&#39;ve become quite the little composter lately and I&#39;m proud to announce that after my first batch failed, I have a strong second and third batch going now.<br /><br />There are two methods for composting, one uses worms, the other doesn&#39;t. I like the non-worm method the best.<br /><br />I keep a small bucket with a lid in my kitchen. I got it at the $1 store, it&#39;s like a 1.5 gallon pail basically. Anyway, we throw all our scraps in there and then once a week we empty it. It does smell a little bit by the end of the week, but honestly it&#39;s not bad at all if you just empty it after a few days.<br /><br />I then have a big garbage bin outside that I drilled a bunch of holes in. I just threw a little dirt, shredded up newspaper, and then mixed in the veggies. I keep it covered and I don&#39;t add water (this is the number one reason composting fails, too much water). I just stir it every week or two with a shovel. <br /><br />It has produced some really good compost, no worms.

				I hope to go to both composting sessions on Sunday.&nbsp; Maybe I&#39;ll go compost-crazy and try both.&nbsp; My decision will depend on whether my landlady allows me to do the outdoor method.&nbsp; Vermicompost sounds a little daunting.<br /><br />~chicken
