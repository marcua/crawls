				My husband is craving a batch of scungili fra diavlo.&nbsp; Can anyone recommend a fish market in Astoria where I can buy either fresh or frozen scungilli?&nbsp; He would double over if I used canned scungilli, although I&#39;ve seen it in a number of recipies.&nbsp; Also, when I read recipies for using fresh or frozen scungilli, they often say to throw a wine cork into the pot as the scungilli boils.&nbsp; Does this really add anything or is it just an old wives tale/tradition?

Lots of work for the same finished product as the canned item.&nbsp; I know it sounds like blaspheme but its a good product.&nbsp; Ask the fish guys, they will say the same.<br /><br />As for the scungili fra diavlo, it is my favorite seafood dish too.&nbsp; I would gladly bring some wine and my own napkin...&nbsp; or at least post your recipe.&nbsp; <br /><br />There is a restaurant in Brooklyn called Fiorentino&#39;s on ave U by east 2nd street. When you order the scungili fra diavlo they ask you how you like the garlic, sliced or chopped.<br /><br />

				I wasn&#39;t looking forward to the cleaning part at all from what I&#39;ve read, so thanks for the tip.&nbsp; I am a bit suprised that the canned works well though.&nbsp; Is there any special tip that I need to keep in mind with the canned?&nbsp; Lots of rinsing, extra cooking time, etc?<br /><br />It&#39;s funny that you mentioned that place in Brooklyn.&nbsp; A friend told us about it too and totally raved about their food.&nbsp;

				When using the canned scungili, your cooking and prep time is almost nill. Use a bit of the liquid when creating your sauce (I would even sacrifice some of the scungili&nbsp; at this point to add flavor).&nbsp; Just before serving, add the remaining scungili into the sauce and heat through, taste and season if needed.<br /><br />Thats it.<br /><br />Ask the fish guys for any other tips.&nbsp; I do like to pick up some shrimp while at the fish store. Either to add to the scungili or for a salad before the meal.<br /><br />
