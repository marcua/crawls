				We’re renting one sunny bedroom in our three-bedroom apartment in Astoria. The room is unfurnished but is large enough to fit a queen sized bed, dresser, and desk and comes equipped with a nice, large closet. The bedroom is also already wired with it’s own cable box and a TV.<br /><br />We’re located ten minutes from the R/V and we’re a fifteen-minute subway ride to midtown Manhattan. The neighborhood is fantastic with grocery and laundry within a block, and all of the shops and restaurants on Steinway about five minutes walk away. The apartment has a very large kitchen and furnished living room, and pretty hardwood floors throughout.<br /><br />Your other roommates are two women in our mid-20&#039;s. We’re both professional, responsible and super fun. We have opposite hours (one of us works during the day and one works evenings) so we’re rarely at the apartment at the same time, but we’re very friendly.<br /><br />Rent is $650 per month and we require one months security deposit ($650). Utilities are not included but they come to (roughly) $75 per month.<br /><br />We’re looking for someone responsible, employed, and friendly. You are also clean, respectful, and a good communicator. Guys and girls are welcome, but no couples please.<br /><br />We’re looking for someone to move in immediately or August 1st. If you’re interested please send us an email and we can set up a time to meet (hopefully this weekend!) Hope to hear from you soon! <br /><br />Photos available at the Craigslist ad- please apply there:<br />http://newyork.craigslist.org/que/roo/1287740633.html
