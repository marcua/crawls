They&#39;re <br />conservative on others, like gun control. But at <br />their core, <br />Libertarians care most about preserving personal <br />freedoms like the <br />freedom to back whomever they want for governor, <br />even if he&#39;s <br />Republican. Republican gubernatorial candidate <br />William Weld said, &quot;I&#39;m <br />the guy who addressed the Republican National <br />Convention in Houston in <br />1992 and said I want the government out of your <br />pocketbook and out of <br />your bedroom. And if that&#39;s not Libertarian I <br />don&#39;t know what is. The <br />Libertarian Party of New York met this weekend at <br />the Best Western Hotel <br />in Colonie and voted William Weld as their man, <br />even though Weld <br />disagrees with many of their core values.<br />http://www.capitalnews9.com/content/politics/?ArID=177498&amp;SecID=285<br /><br />Snooping Capital of America<br />New York again leads the nation in criminal <br />wiretaps. New York <br />prosecutors reported 391 wiretap applications, <br />followed by California <br />with 235, New Jersey with 218 and Florida with <br />72. Court officials say <br />those four states accounted for four out of every <br />five wiretaps in the <br />nation. Across the country, state judges last <br />year approved 17 percent <br />more wiretaps, while federal criminal wiretaps <br />dropped 14 percent. <br />Overall, court-approved wiretaps increased 4 <br />percent to 1,773 in both <br />state and federal investigations. Only one <br />application was denied. The <br />increase in 2005 was much smaller than the 2004 <br />figures, which leaped 19 <br />percent. Critics say the figures raise worries <br />that judges aren&#39;t <br />thoroughly scrutinizing eavesdropping <br />applications. Over the past 10 <br />years, the number of wiretaps have jumped almost <br />70 percent.<br />http://www.wstm.com/Global/story.asp?S=4843464&amp;nav=2aKD<br /><br />Mean Genes<br />Standing alongside the city&#39;s police commissioner <br />and all five district <br />attorneys, Mayor Bloomberg pressed Albany <br />Democrats to approve plans for <br />collecting DNA from all convicted criminals. Mr. <br />Bloomberg wants New <br />York to create the nation&#39;s most extensive DNA <br />data bank, collecting <br />genetic material from anyone convicted of a <br />felony or misdemeanor. <br />People convicted of noncriminal violations - like <br />disorderly conduct and <br />open container citations - could keep their DNA <br />to themselves.<br />http://www.nysun.com/article/32154<br /><br />Jobs Program for Cops<br />Governments in Canada should steer clear from <br />adopting or emulating any <br />drug policies in the United States, an outspoken <br />New York state <br />prosecutor said Tuesday. &quot;My advice to Canada is <br />stay as completely far <br />away from U.S. drug law policy as possible,&quot; said <br />David Soares, the <br />Democratic district attorney for Albany County. <br />In a scathing <br />condemnation of his state and country&#39;s drug war, <br />Soares said lawmakers, <br />judges and prosecutors in the United States know <br />their system is <br />ineffective, but they support it anyway because <br />it provides law <br />enforcement officials with lucrative jobs.<br />http://www.newsday.com/news/local/wire/newyork/ny-bc-ny--prosecutor-drugla0503may03,0,3394256.story<br /><br />====================<br /><br />* Rant of the Week *<br /><br />PREPARED REMARKS OF WILLIAM F. WELD<br />Libertarian Party Convention<br />Albany, New York <br />April 29, 2006&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Proper governance can be summed up in one phrase: <br />Keep out of my <br />pocketbook and out of my bedroom. When the <br />government leaves citizens <br />alone, it empowers them. Without undue government <br />interference, we <br />retain the unlimited possibilities provided <br />through choice and <br />competition. It is the individual who decides how <br />to properly spend his <br />money; and it is the family that decides what is <br />best for its children.<br />&nbsp;<br />After all, as John Stuart Mill pointed out, &quot;The <br />worth of the state, in <br />the long run, is the worth of the individuals <br />composing it.&quot; This is why <br />it is important to preserve freedoms and empower <br />individuals.<br />&nbsp;<br />New York State has done a reasonable job of <br />staying out of our bedrooms. <br />New Yorkers support a woman&#39;s right to choose and <br />so do most of its <br />public servants.<br />&nbsp;<br />While our government seems amenable to staying <br />away from the bedroom, it <br />is having a harder time keeping its mitts out of <br />our wallets.<br />&nbsp;<br />In search of votes, politicians continue to turn <br />government into a <br />grocery store offering never ending goodies to <br />voters. They forget, or <br />willfully ignore, that it is the voters that must <br />ultimately pay for <br />these things--through a loss of liberty and a <br />loss of resources. And by <br />taking liberty from the individual, we weaken the <br />state.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />New York is spending too much. By way of example, <br />New York&#39;s Medicaid <br />program is more expensive than California, even <br />though its program <br />covers 55 percent less people. Last year&#39;s <br />Medicaid budget was bigger <br />than Florida and Texas combined. If New York just <br />cut the size of its <br />Medicaid program to twice the national average, <br />taxpayers would save <br />$5.3 billion.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />And how does New York feed its out of control <br />spending? New York taxes. <br />In fact, we tax more than most other states, and <br />we have created the <br />worst business tax climate in the nation.&nbsp; <br /><br />When we are not taxing, then we are borrowing. <br />The Citizens Budget <br />Commission just revealed that New Yorkâ€™s state <br />and local governments and <br />their public authorities have borrowed $227 <br />billion.<br /><br />And when we run out revenues from taxing and <br />borrowing, New York has to <br />turn to creative budgeting and other schemes. The <br />specter of eminent <br />domain abuses now exists in light of the Supreme <br />Court&#39;s Kelo decision.<br /><br />We are now seeing the effects of misguided fiscal <br />policy. New Yorkers <br />are leaving. And they are leaving in droves. We <br />are losing our talent. <br />We are losing our young. Between 2000 and 2005, <br />New York lost 1 million <br />people. I think it is because other states are <br />successfully competing <br />for our people. Florida and Texas have no state <br />income tax. And other <br />southern and western states have significantly <br />lower property taxes.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />Fortunately, there are some simple things we can <br />do to keep the <br />government out of our pocketbook:<br />&nbsp;<br />First, we can send government to bed without its <br />supper. In other words, <br />cut taxes. I have always said, taxation is <br />theft--organized theft, but <br />theft all the same. If we truly want to create <br />jobs and help families <br />and individuals, we could do worse than to <br />eliminate all income taxes <br />for people earning under $75,000 per year.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />I believe in eliminating taxes for this <br />demographic, because New York&#39;s <br />tax burden effectively robs them of the power of <br />choice. If you are a <br />family earning $50,000, you may not have the <br />choice of where to send <br />your children to school. You may not have a <br />choice of whether to <br />purchase health insurance.&nbsp; <br /><br />I also want to eliminate taxes for those earning <br />under $75,000 per year, <br />because I want to create an incentive to stay in <br />New York. Living in New <br />York should be a choice--an attractive choice. If <br />you are earning <br />$50,000 per year, Florida, without its income <br />tax, becomes a very <br />attractive locale.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />I also plan on limiting property tax increases to <br />2 1/2 per cent of <br />total valuation, and limit growth in that tax to <br />2 1/2 percent per year.<br />&nbsp;<br />Second, we can put a leash and collar on <br />government spending. I have <br />proposed a taxpayers&#39; bill of rights that will <br />limit government spending <br />to the previous year&#39;s revenues, with adjustments <br />for population growth <br />and inflation. If New York government wants to <br />increase spending, then <br />it will have to ask the voters for permission. If <br />there is a surplus, <br />the government will have to give half back to <br />taxpayers in the form of a <br />tax rebate, and put the rest in a rainy day fund.<br />&nbsp;<br />Third, we should limit borrowing. In New York, <br />there is a constitutional <br />requirement that state debt be approved by <br />voters. The government gets <br />around this by issuing debt through public <br />authorities. This loophole <br />must be closed.<br />&nbsp;<br />Last, we need to end clever government methods to <br />increase the tax base. <br />There are, of course, proper uses of eminent <br />domain. Takings for public <br />infrastructure improvements are proper. <br />Unfortunately, the Supreme Court <br />Kelo decision permits the government to uses <br />eminent domain solely to <br />increase a government&#39;s tax base. This, I <br />believe, is improper. While <br />the government has the power to tax, it does not <br />exist to tax. Taxing is <br />not, and should never be a public use under the <br />constitution. A better <br />decision would have recognized that the state has <br />no inherent right to <br />&quot;increased tax revenue.&quot; The citizens, and our <br />constitution, limit that <br />function. There is, in the final analysis, no <br />such thing as government <br />money; there is only taxpayers&#39; money.<br />&nbsp;<br />Taxes and spending are just one facet of improper <br />government intrusion. <br />Regulation is another aspect. New York businesses <br />suffer from high job <br />killing costs. In addition to Medicaid, New York <br />businesses also have <br />high energy costs, workers compensation costs, <br />and tort costs. Excessive <br />regulation kills jobs and limits freedom and <br />stifles choice. <br />&nbsp;<br />Not every person in this room will agree on every <br />position, but I think <br />that everyone here agrees with the fundamental <br />principles of freedom, <br />choice and competition. I am an aficionado--a <br />disciple even--of <br />Friedrich Hayek. A government that respects <br />individual rights is the <br />government that best represents the spirit of <br />American democracy. <br />Removing the burdens of taxation and reducing the <br />cost of doing business <br />empowers our individuals and our economy. This <br />will lead to good paying <br />jobsâ€”not some expansive government program that <br />decides what&#39;s best for <br />New Yorkers.<br /><br />In short, I would like to remind everyone here of <br />the words of Robert <br />Nozick:&nbsp; <br /><br />&quot;There are only individual people, different <br />individual people, with <br />their own individual lives. Using one of these <br />people for the benefit of <br />others, uses him and benefits the others. Nothing <br />more.&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />It&#39;s time to empower individuals. Through <br />individual choice and <br />competition, we will grow as a state and prosper. <br />It&#39;s time to make New <br />York an example of proper governance, of freedom, <br />choice and limited <br />government.<br /><br />There is much at stake: Again, as John Stuart <br />Mill cautioned: &quot;A state <br />which dwarfs its men, in order that they may be <br />more docile instruments <br />in its hands, even for beneficial purposes, will <br />find that with small <br />men, no great thing can really be accomplished.&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />Thank you.<br /><br />===================<br /><br />* Upcoming Events *<br /><br />Saturday, May 6, 10:00 a.m. â€“ 5:00 p.m.<br />Operation Politically Homeless booth<br />Join the Manhattan Libertarian Party at this fun <br />outreach project.<br />Second Avenue Festival<br />2nd Avenue between 11th and 12th Streets<br />http://www.manhattanlp.org<br /><br />Monday, May 8, 6:30 p.m.<br />Manhattan Libertarian Party monthly meeting<br />Guest speaker: Vijay Govindan, Regional Currency <br />Officer for the Liberty <br />Dollar<br />Food and drink service available<br />Ukrainian East Village Restaurant, 140 Second <br />Avenue<br />http://www.manhattanlp.org<br /><br />Monday, May 8, 10:30 p.m.<br />&quot;The Libertarian Alternative&quot;<br />A Libertarian political talk show<br />Time Warner Cable Ch. 34, RCN Cable Ch. 110, MNN <br />Ch. 1<br />http://www.libertarianalternative.org<br /><br />Tuesday, May 9, 8:30 p.m.<br />&quot;Hardfire&quot;<br />A Libertarian political talk show focusing on NYC<br />Time Warner Cable Ch. 56<br />http://hardfire.net<br /><br />Wednesday, May 10, 7:00 p.m.<br />The Republican-Libertarian Alliance<br />2005 Libertarian Comptroller Candidate Ron Moore <br />will discuss what a <br />Libertarian is and how Libertarians and <br />Republicans may work together. <br />Refreshments served.<br />$5 for TR/Gramercy Park Republican Group Members, <br />$15 for non-Members<br />191 Seventh Avenue #2S at W. 21st Street<br />http://www.tr-group.com/events/events.php<br /><br />Saturday, May 13, 11:00 a.m.<br />Queens Libertarian Party monthly meeting<br />Guest speaker: Guerrilla Activist Jim Lesczynski<br />Bohemian Hall<br />29-19 24th Avenue, Astoria<br />http://www.lpqc.org<br /><br />================================<br /><br />* News tips, rants and events wanted! *<br /><br />Help us improve THE VILLAGE CHOICE.
