				Hi guys,<br /><br />So the mighty Corolla needs new tires. Anyone have any recommendations for/against anywhere in the neighborhood? It seems like there&#039;s a few places I could go (http://maps.google.com/maps?client=firefox-a&amp;channel=s&amp;hl=en&amp;q=tires+11105&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=40.765201,-73.907604&amp;spn=0.093221,0.160675&amp;z=13&amp;om=1). In the past, I&#039;ve always gone to a Firestone-type place, but I figured I&#039;d ask here. :)<br /><br />Ooooh, Costco has tires. Maybe this will finally convince me to go and buy a Costco membership, haha.

				I always go to the Goodyear place on Newtown Avenue and 31st Street. Their prices are reasonable, the service quick. I&#039;ve tended to go in the early morning on my way to work and have never had a problem getting out of there quickly.

				Do your research on tires! Buy them online and have them delivered to the shop. Corolla tires are small so you can easily pop four in the trunk. <br /><br />The tires are going to have a huge effect on the ride. Get good ones.<br />

				Oh.. no you&#039;re not going to change the tire.. Take it to the tire shop.&nbsp; You can buy the rubber online, have them ship to your house then send them in. Give me a few min.. I&#039;ll find some nice tires for you.l.<br />

				Newtonian - thank you anyway, but I just came back from getting my tires. I went to the place barrister recommended, and they were quick and reasonable, as she said. (I had to get them today because I have no other time later this week, and the front tires were pretty bad, tread-wise).<br /><br />That was very nice of you though to offer to help me :)
