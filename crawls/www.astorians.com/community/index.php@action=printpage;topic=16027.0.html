				Ok. So I&#039;m trying to make some delicious cold fruit and cheese kebabs, but I can&#039;t find any wooden skewers. But I have only checked Key Foods and Rite Aide so far. I&#039;m thinking the Euro Mart might have some? Also I went into the city today looking for a bento box but it was so crowded out, I was like gah! And came back to Astoria. I know this is a loooong shot but does anyone know if there&#039;s a place that may sell bento boxes and the like around Astoria? I guess I don&#039;t mind schlepping out to Woodside tomorrow if I have to, but closer is preferable... I also went to East Village cheeses today because people I know said they had some good bargains, but I don&#039;t think it was all that awesome there. So if anyone knows a good cheese/deli shop, let me know. I am awefully demanding today I apologize. I feel like I need more varied lunches for work, sandwich and yogurt can only hold my love for so long, so I figured trying out some bento recipes would be exciting. I&#039;ll do take 2 on making onigiri, the first time I tried making it, they all looked just terrible.&nbsp; And I have no idea what I should get for groceries. Maybe just subsisting off of $2 cereal is ok...

Village (or Grand Central, but crowded). More expensive than E. Village. Or certainly any of the fancy groceries (Whole Paycheck, Garden of Eden, Fairway). If you just want relatively standard stuff, you could always go to somewhere like Rosarios under the Ditmars stop.<br />

				Saxelby&#039;s (http://www.saxelbycheese.com/) in the Essex St. Market (http://www.essexstreetmarket.com/) has its fans. (What&#039;s small and cardboard and smells like a sock? A holiday box o&#039; cheese ..)

				Stop and Shop on Northern Blvd and 48th St. has a good selection of cheese.&nbsp; They probably sell skewers somewhere there as well.

Thanks for the tip! :) I like Sai&#039;s organics and all, but I wish there were a whole Foods in Astoria. They have such awesome cheeses! I love love really salty crumbly cheeses and goat brie. Soooo good. I found out you can make onigiri with the same kinda rice that you make risotto with, well in theory, that&#039;s what I&#039;ve read. I&#039;ll have to check out Saxelby&#039;s, maybe one day after work, I just can&#039;t do Manhattan on weekends anymore, too many blorange tourists excited about shopping in the city. *blech*&nbsp; I&#039;ll try Stop n&#039; Shop too,&nbsp; I miss going there when I visited my extended family in Cape Cod. They had delicious popsicles that had weird flavors like bubble gum, and cotton candy, which actually were pretty tastey, unlike most cotton candy and bubble gum flavored things.

				The Key Food off of 30th Ave &amp; 33rd St has skewers.<br /><br />They&#039;re not easy to find, though, they&#039;re in the back on a free standing rack by the cheeses and meats.
