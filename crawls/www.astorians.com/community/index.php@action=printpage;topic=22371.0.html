				<br />Hopeful about this being good. Anyone have experience with the original location of De Mole in Woodside/Sunnyside?<br /><br /><br />They&#039;re announcing this on their website - I saw the location with the sign now up as of today too (thanks to @tastoriaqueens for this tweeted tidbit):<br />http://www.demolenyc.com/ (http://www.demolenyc.com/)

				I&#039;m really excited about this.&nbsp; Reviews on Yelp of De Mole&#039;s Sunnyside location are very positive.&nbsp; For those who live in that section of Astoria, please keep us posted on when they are open.

				Wow, this is great! I was underwhelmed last time I ate there, but am more than happy to try them again. I know they have quite a following in Sunnyside.

				We recently ate at the Sunnyside location.&nbsp; They impressed us every step of the way.&nbsp; The place was subdued and bistro like.&nbsp; The food from apps to entree showed a real chef in the kitchen.&nbsp; Wine by the glass was good price, big pour and excellent for what it was.&nbsp; Service was quiet, efficient and friendly.&nbsp; Let&#039;s be honest, this was not what you would normally expect from a Mexican place in Sunnyside.&nbsp; When I saw the awning going up on 30th avenue I rushed to tell my wife about it.&nbsp; Cannot wait for the grand opening.&nbsp; Wife gave a much fuller review on Yelp (Jennifer).

				I haven&#039;t been in, but walk by every day...looks like they are having a decent start. I hope they add more to the plain interior decor...the light fixtures are very nice, but the walls are bare!&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />Im also very curious to hear from anyone who gets there before me.

				I was there recently at the Sunnyside location and enjoyed it so much more this time than the previous time. Looking forward to checking out the Astoria location, too!

				Went yesterday and was extremely impressed.&nbsp; It&#039;s still very new.&nbsp; Just painted and not fully decorated.&nbsp; Liquor license not yet approved.&nbsp; But the kitchen is going full blast and the food is spectacular.&nbsp; The ceviche is incredible.&nbsp; Rich and buttery from the avocado.&nbsp; The scallops were fresh and delicious.&nbsp; No rubbery squid.&nbsp; Just a very rich and tasty ceviche with only bay scallops, onions, fresh herbs, and citrus.&nbsp; The corn tamales with cheese are very good.&nbsp; Hot chili peppers and red sauce down the middle gives them a really spicy bite.&nbsp; The chicken enchiladas with mole sauce is really outstanding.&nbsp; It&#039;s not one of those moles with a bunch of melted chocolate in it to appeal to Americans.&nbsp; It&#039;s peppery and complex.&nbsp; A hint of cocoa to round it out.&nbsp; I loved it.&nbsp; There were fish tacos as a special yesterday. Outstanding.&nbsp; Simple, fresh fish and soft warm tortillas.&nbsp; In my opinion, it&#039;s the best Mexican I&#039;ve had anywhere in Astoria.&nbsp; It think this place is going to be very popular. Especially after they add beer and sangria.&nbsp; The waitress was super friendly and offered some very good advice about our choices.

				TJT, you said it brother!&nbsp; We went last week for dinner and loved it.&nbsp; Yes the place is not finished yet, yes it looks a bit bare, yes it is not the cozy bistro setting found at their original Sunnyside location.&nbsp; But it is delicious.&nbsp; We brought in some beer from deli next door and settled in for a chill meal.&nbsp; <br /><br />Fish ceviche was in a corn tortilla bowl with finely diced red onions, tomato and avocado plus the usual herbs and lime juice.&nbsp; Was a bit mild but so fresh and clean.&nbsp; We loved it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Guacamole was a decent portion.&nbsp; Butter smooth and fresh.&nbsp; Served with paper bag of tortilla strips.&nbsp; My son loved that part best.<br /><br />We had two burritos.&nbsp; Carne asada and the pork.&nbsp; Both were full sized, rich and nicely balanced with a very creamy crema.&nbsp; <br /><br />Over all two thumbs up and an extra thumb for good prices.&nbsp; Child friendly too.&nbsp; We were there at 630 and it was mostly families.&nbsp; <br />
