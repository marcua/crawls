				She is dead to me. I turn off the news when they start talking about her, I look away from magazines with her picture on the cover, I won&#039;t google her, when Pandora puts her music on my playlist I vote it off the station - all my attempt to do my part to avoid any indication to media sources that she is newsworthy and I would rather hear about her than say, global warming.<br /><br />Despite all of this, I&#039;m dying of curiousity. WTF <i>is</i> up with her? (Word of mouth or forum gossip is ok)<br /><br />I heard buzz cut and rehab.

				The buzz cut itself is cool, I&#039;ve wanted one on occasion myself - it&#039;s just that it seems more of an acting out attention-whore thing than a &quot;being my own person/breaking the chains of patriarchal oppression&quot; thing. <br /><br />Who knows?

				I just wonder if she has a substance problem, or merely a case of really bad judgment.&nbsp; I tend to think the latter, but obviously I have no way of knowing for sure.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)<br /><br />Oddly enough, in this case, my compassion reflex does not kick in.&nbsp; I don&#039;t really feel that bad for her.

				She needs help big time.&nbsp; I think cutting her hair is a big cry for help, albiet in her subconscious.&nbsp; Unfortunately, she will not get better unless she is ready to accept the help, and like with many addicts, she may need to fall real hard before she can get her life on the right track.&nbsp; Most likely she&#039;s on some drugs, and I do feel sorry for her.&nbsp; It can&#039;t be easy being in the spotlight all the time.&nbsp; But in the end, picking herself up is going to be her responsibility.&nbsp; &nbsp;Those kids are not going to have an easy life.

				I feel sorry for her, but even more so because I think there&#039;s a greater fascination in the media with female celebrities than with male celebrities.&nbsp; Would anyone really care if a male performer went out partying night after night?&nbsp; I was looking at one mag when I was waiting for a prescription refill at the drugstore, and it actually had a chart comparing the post-breakup accomplishments of Britney and Justin Timberlake.&nbsp; Is this really necessary?&nbsp; I think that the strongest feelings people should have toward celebrities is polite disinterest.

				Here&#039;s an article on MSN Encarta that suggests a few possibilities: Celebrity Obsession: Is it Wrong? (http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/Columns/?Article=celebritymain). <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Joel Stein, who often interviews celebrities for Time magazine, and who wrote a star-studded column for Entertainment Weekly before he was replaced by a bigger celebrity known as Stephen King, thinks star gazing could have something to do with the demise of small-town America. When people started living in big cities, they lost having that common group of people to gossip about. Celebrities filled that niche. <br /><br />Kat Giantis, who writes about celebrity gossip for MSN, has another theory. By tracking celebrity successes and glamorous romances, we get to experience their lives vicariously. And the flip side of that coin is schadenfreude, she says. When the rich and famous screw up, our normal-sized lives seem all that much better.<br /><br />My own theory is a little wackier, and based on my lifelong interest in mythology. I think the modern celebrity fills a bit of the same role played by the Greek gods. Unlike more modern deities, the Greek gods made mistakes, had feuds, and often got into trouble--sometimes of the most personal romantic nature. The Greeks shared these stories, in part, as entertainment--a little bit like a prototype People magazine. As those gods were replaced by an all-knowing, all-seeing, and always-perfect creator, stories about people behaving both bravely and badly had to fill the gap. And so, in my theory, were invented the first human celebrities. <br /><br />Francisco Gil-White, a psychology professor at the University of Pennsylvania, has yet another theory--that celebrity obsession has to do with how human beings form relationships. Gil-White says that human beings are unlike other animals in that most of what they know about the world, they learn from other humans. As part of this, the most successful human beings are ranked the most highly socially. We look up to them and even suck up to them so that they will want to interact with us. This is an adapative behavior. We benefit from using information and from being in the good graces of the successful. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

They feel that the respect for family members has been replaced by worship of the famous, as this is the new method of associating with success. In modern cultures, there is less emphasis on the value of experience, but instead knowing the &#039;secret&#039; of success, and celebrities are seen to hold this, since they often come from mediocrity.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />What we do, and why we do it, are topics of endless fascination...

				Great article Meg- thanks for posting it. I am not by any means a Britney Spears fan, but I have to say I have felt so sorry for her and her kids these last few months. She really is self destructing. I hope she is able to get help. At the end of the day she is just a vunerable human being.

				<br />That was an interesting article, Meg.&nbsp; In all honesty, I know what its like to be hounded. <br />Britney needs to take a break.&nbsp; She should move to Europe.&nbsp; The thing with me and this story is that there are so many girls who idealize Britney Spears, and may think this sort of behavior is hip. <br /><br />Ok, on a lighter note. If you take &quot;Britney&quot; + &quot;Spears&quot;, merge both words, then create an anagram of the merged letters, what do you get?&nbsp; Answer: Presbyterians&nbsp; <br />
