				I don&#039;t know. I am more of the agnostic flavor so for me maybe there is and maybe there isn&#039;t. I grew up Christian, however, so everything was a sign then. I&#039;ll admit that sometimes there does to seem to be weird coincidences...perhaps those are signs?

				I think &quot;signs&quot; are seen when you want to see them. they are self-fulfilling prophecies. maybe for that reason they should be heeded--it&#039;s you telling yourself the way you want or think it should be.

				Here&#039;s the thing: when I was 18 and in my first year of college I wrote my first novel. It was about a girl who lived in NYC and wanted to be a writer, had a poopie job, a string of meaningless encounters with men and a general malaise about everything. The weird, spooky thing is that it was like I wrote my own future. (actually now that I think about it it is a pretty common future and a predictable one but at the time I didn&#039;t think it would turn out that way for me...oh how naive). <br /><br />Right now, I&#039;m trying to decide if I should stay in NYC or leave. My lease ends this month. My temporary job ends next week. I want to go home. I probably will go home. For a while I wanted to stay but right now I am ready to go. But I&#039;m not 100% there and still deeply conflicted...ambivalent. There&#039;s a chance my temporary job could become permanent. And so far things have been going really well there. And if they made me an offer, it might seem foolish to turn down a job in this economy, even if it means staying in a place where I&#039;m not exactly happy. So I&#039;ve been wishing for a sign that would give me a clue one way or the other...and you know, in that story I wrote, the character leaves New York and finds what she&#039;s looking for...serenity and all that. It seems like since so much has turned out exactly as I wrote it that this would, too. I&#039;m getting a little bit squirrely waiting for thigns to work themselves out. So yeah, maybe its not a sign, but I&#039;d like to believe it is.<br /><br />and please, nobody make fun of me. that would really hurt my feelings and make me sad&nbsp; :oops:

				I&#039;ll be the first to admit that NYC can suck hard sometimes.&nbsp; It&#039;s a lonely, emotionally rough place, and I think that everyone who has ever come here from somewhere else, has thought about leaving.&nbsp; <br />Here&#039;s the best advice someone gave me when I was down in the dumps here.&nbsp; Once a week, take a day or a few hours and do something that you&#039;ve never, in your life, done before.&nbsp; Examples may include: taking the bus to Red Hook, Brooklyn to eat latin food at the soccer fields, Riding the Cyclone in Coney Island, Visiting Ellis Island, taking a trapeze class.&nbsp; The beauty of NYC is that the number of unique, interesting things, a lot of which are low cost or even free, you just might have to spend some time internetting.&nbsp; The more oddball crap that you find yourself doing, the more oddball characters you&#039;ll meet, and the more stories you&#039;ll have to tell (or write about).<br />Giving up is the worst thing you can do right now, in my estimation (this is coming from the Prince of Giving Up) because you know what going home has in store for you, but who knows what can happen here.

				Betheroonie06, I think that if you set yourself up to have your life play out like your novel then it will.&nbsp; I&#039;m not entirely sure if I believe in signs but I know for sure that you have the power to create a fullfilling, satisfying future for yourself.&nbsp; If we get caught up in our failures and negativity, for example, then we are just bringing more failure and negativity to ourselves.&nbsp; I say rewrite that novel (despite the happy ending) and put to paper what you want to be happening in your life write now.&nbsp; Write <span class="bbc_u">your</span> story.&nbsp; Good luck with whatever it is you decided to do.<br /><br />(I hope I haven&#039;t sounded like someone that should be on Oprah)

Which surprised quite a few people who knew how much I hate snow, among other things.<br /><br />Still satisfied and with peace.<br />But it is easy to understand that others may be happier elsewhere away from the madness that is NY.<br /><br />Good luck with your story(s) and with your choices.<br /><br />

I am a writer, and I wanted to live here. Those things aren&#039;t interconnected. Besides, I worked for a summer at a publishing house in Minneapolis (my hometown) and that will be the place I try first, when I finally finish what I am working on (it&#039;s entirely new). I can write from anywhere. That&#039;s not the point. The point is my grandmother&#039;s 85th birthday is next month and I want to be there, and I don&#039;t know how many years she has left, and I would like to see her more often than once every six months, which is all I have been able to manage since I&#039;ve been here. Additionally, if I go home, I have a plan, and my plan is to go to grad school and get an M.Ed and teach ESL, which is something that I really want to do and have been thinking about for a long time, and would give me summers off to write. I don&#039;t want to put it off anymore. I want to get it done. (I know, I could do that here, blah blah, but I&#039;ve done my research and have concluded it would be much easier to do it elsewhere. End of discussion). <br /><br />And the thing is that we can get used to anything, including this city&#039;s Murphy&#039;s Law antics. We become jaded. And New York has a lot to offer but there are things I miss that New York sorely lacks, like trees, grass, gardens, the sound of crickets at night, of thunderstorms on summer nights and my closest friends. Also, I want to go to the University of Minnesota, because it&#039;s pretty cool. <br /><br />Its just that a few people, namely my therapist, keep trying to convince me to stay, (and she&#039;s getting on my last nerve--she doesn&#039;t want to lose a client, and her agenda pushing is pissing me off. I know an agenda when I see one!) and I find my self having to justify my wanting to go That, and people do seem to have this attitude of &quot;leaving NYC = giving up&quot; (not you, KidMurdock) which is ludicrous...there are many more cities in this country and they are pretty awesome. Well, some of them. Maybe I&#039;ll miss New York more than I think and that&#039;s what worries me, maybe I&#039;ll regret it. But if my grandma dies, I&#039;ll regret that a lot more, not being with her more, that is. <br /><br />Anyway sorry for my self indulgent rambling. All I wanted to say was originally that it was weird that so much turned out like i wrote it, i didn&#039;t &quot;set it up&quot; that way. Also, last night I got sushi and I said to myself, &quot;tomorrow they are totally going to have sushi in the cafeteria at work&quot;. And they did! Is it a sign? Maybe, I don&#039;t know of what, though...maybe I&#039;m just clairvoyant when it coems to food... :lol:

				I totally believe in signs, just don&#039;t know what to do with them. The weirdest sign I received was last year the day of my birthday.&nbsp; I was showering in the morning (as I always do) and was thinking that it would be really cool to get a tattoo.&nbsp; I thought at that moment that I would like a star and that I would place it on my wrist. Then I began to think if it would be weird in certain work situations, but then switched to something entirely different. <br /><br />Fast forward to that night I had dinner in Astoria and my waiter had a tatoo of a star on his wrist.&nbsp; Or maybe it was a symbol that stood for a star.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I think I actually posted about it somewhere.

The weirdest sign I received was last year the day of my birthday.&nbsp; I was showering in the morning (as I always do) and was thinking that it would be really cool to get a tattoo.&nbsp; I thought at that moment that I would like a star and that I would place it on my wrist. Then I began to think if it would be weird in certain work situations, but then switched to something entirely different. <br /><br />Fast forward to that night I had dinner in Astoria and my waiter had a tatoo of a star on his wrist.&nbsp; Or maybe it was a symbol that stood for a star.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I think I actually posted about it somewhere. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So, did you end up getting it? BTW, It&#039;s nice to hear from someone who does believe in signs&nbsp; :mrgreen: And, my $.02 about tattoos: You don&#039;t have to be 100% sure what you want or where you want it, because, more often than not, you will fall in love with the result. When i got my tattoo, I originally wanted to get Picasso&#039;s signature, but I didn&#039;t have a copy of it when I went to the tattoo parlor, and they couldn&#039;t do it. I had also been thinking about getting &quot;Liberté&quot; (&quot;freedom&quot; in French), and the friends who were with me at the parlor knew it, and told me they liked that idea, and I went through the book of fonts they had, picked one out, and that&#039;s what I got and I absolutely love my tattoo. Most people I know love their tattoos--unless you&#039;re drunk or your artist does a bad job or you get something like a swastika or someone&#039;s name, you probably won&#039;t regret it. I&#039;m going to get another one eventually, and I want it on my wrist as well, and right now I&#039;m thinking of a Swedish Dala horse, since my dad&#039;s side is Swedish. I&#039;m not sure if I want it to be in color or just black but I know either way I&#039;ll be happy in the end. <br /><br />Jeez...I should have this kind of clarity about other things....something to think about...

				I believe in signs because I believe that the human mind is trained to recognize its own needs. You get cravings for strawberries when you need vitamin C or feel the need to be outside in the sun if you body needs vitamin D production. You know when you&#039;re too tired, cold or wet. I believe that we see signs because our subconscious knows what it is that we need and it tries to communicate this to us based upon what we notice in the world around us. There are hundreds of things around you every moment that you don&#039;t notice. &quot;Signs&quot; that you don&#039;t pick up on. But the ones that your brain does take note of and process are the ones that I believe are important. I think the recognition and realization of signs is like that of dreams.<br /><br />Just my $.02. <br /><br />Also, on the tattoo part: I carried the designs for both of my tattoos around in my wallet for 30 days before I got them done. The guy who did them both for me was a close friend and it was on his recommendation that I did it. He said if you still loved it and didn&#039;t question the design or want to change something after a month, there&#039;s no way you wouldn&#039;t just grow to love it more and more once you got it done.
