				Hi all,<br /><br />I am sponsoring a free concert Monday night at 6:00p in Athens Square Park.&nbsp; The concert will feature amazing performers - including local Broadway stars and high school talent.&nbsp; We will have free food, a free raffle, and kid-friendly activities.&nbsp; The entire community is invited; it promises to be a fun night for all!&nbsp; The concert features:<br /><br />Tristen Buetel, a high school student and one of Astoria&#039;s rising stars<br />Janine Divita of &quot;Grease&quot;, an Astorian<br />Erica Dorfler of &quot;Avenue Q&quot;, an Astorian<br />Demi Fragale, a local Astorian up-and-comer<br />Jene Hernandez of &quot;The L Word&quot;, and &quot;In The Heights&quot; workshop, an Astorian<br />Karla Mosley Frei-Pearson of &quot;Guiding Light&quot; and &quot;Hi-5&quot;, an Astorian (I&#039;m biased, but Karla is my favorite performer - she is also my wife!)<br />N&#039;Kenge Pacurar of &quot;Sondheim on Sondheim&quot;<br /><br />Two of Astoria&#039;s greatest strengths are our diversity and our talented artistic community.&nbsp; This concert is a celebration of both, and we hope to see you there!<br /><br />For those of you who don&#039;t know, I am running for State Assembly.&nbsp; I think we, as a community and as a State, are at a crossroads.&nbsp; You all, the voters in this election, have a very serious choice to make in this election.&nbsp; I&#039;m not going to make a political speech here.&nbsp; But I do want to say that there are real differences between all 3 candidates (lots of differences - John and I differ strongly on social issues; Aravella and I differ strongly on reform), and I hope you will meet us all and then judge for yourself whom can best represent you.&nbsp; To learn more about me and my campaign, go to www.jfp2010.org<br /><br />Also, given some of the comments that have appeared on this blog and elsewhere, I want to stress that I think both of my opponents are, at bottom, sincere people who want to serve.&nbsp; I have serious disagreements with them on policy, but I will do everything in my power to have an honest debate and to avoid mud-slinging and personal attacks.&nbsp; I hope to earn your support, but, more importantly, I promise to run an honest campaign that will earn your respect.<br /><br />Enough politics for now.&nbsp; I hope I see you at the concert!&nbsp; <br /><br />(Mods, if I posted this on the wrong board, I apologize and please move it.&nbsp; Thanks!)<br />

				Thanks Daisy!<br /><br />FYI, I&#039;m going to be off this message board for most of the weekend, but, if folks have questions, I&#039;m happy to try to answer them early next week.

				It&#039;s so great to see one of the candidates come to the forum in person! This sounds like a fun event, I hope I can get out of work in time.

				Hope it is a beautiful evening. At the very least, the artistic roster is a great one.<br /><br /><br />Do you expect any local press will be there?<br />When does petitioning start? So will there be 3 Democrat candidates collecting signatures? Would your petition only cover for your race?<br />I&#039;d like to ask you some questions after Monday. But appreciate all must be very busy early summer.<br /><br /><br /><br />With all folks could afford, I think supporting campaigns is a worthy expense. I am leaning towards making a small donation to Jeremiah, and probably Aravella as well. If there is a 3rd Democrat, not much chance.

				TRX, petitioning starts on Tuesday, June 8th. As far as local press--a press release went out last week &amp; some follow up efforts were made so we&#039;ll see!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=18430.msg196846.html#msg196846">Quote from: TRX on June 04, 2010, 11:53:00 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">With all folks could afford, I think supporting campaigns is a worthy expense.

It&#039;s not much, but I do what I can because every dollar helps and one of his opponents is heavily funded by the likes of John Catsimatidis. I make up for being too broke to help out financially by volunteering my time--a great alternative for people who can&#039;t afford to make a donation!

				Mr. Murphy can you please stop all the negativity. Everywhere I see you post you have some sort of negative comment. Please stop it is hurting your candidate.<br /><br />

As far as I can see, the vast majority of the negativity has been coming from the Simotas side on this board--your posts included, hellsgatetim. And what did mjmurphy say, exactly? That one of Jeremiah Frei-Pearson&#039;s opponents is funded by John Catsimatidis? He didn&#039;t say which opponent or even place a value judgment on the statement.<br /><br />It&#039;s absolutely ridiculous how quickly every discussion of this race devolves into this kind of nonsense. I&#039;m impressed that Jeremiah Frei-Pearson came and posted here himself. And Mr Murphy is a volunteer for Frei-Pearson&#039;s campaign and not hiding who he is either. On the Simotas side, I mostly see a lot of anonymous negativity. I hope I can find time to attend a candidate forum or something soon because I have to believe the Simotas supporters on this board aren&#039;t representative of her campaign.

				Thanks for the comments.&nbsp; Tomorrow looks like it&#039;s going to be a beautiful day, and I&#039;m very excited by the amazing group of performers (I&#039;m extra excited to have Karla back in town; she&#039;s been gone for most of the week).&nbsp; I&#039;m also excited by the energy behind this campaign; we just opened our campaign office&nbsp; on the corner of Astoria Boulevard and 31st Street - feel free to stop by and check it out.<br /><br />As promised, I wanted to answer TRX&#039;s questions:<br /><br />Do you expect any local press will be there?<br />-Press has been invited and we hope they will attend.&nbsp; In any case, we will post video on youtube.<br />When does petitioning start? <br />-Tuesday.<br />So will there be 3 Democrat candidates collecting signatures? <br />-I think so.&nbsp; One lesson I&#039;ve learned in politics is nothing is certain, but I expect there will be 3 of us collecting signatures.<br />Would your petition only cover for your race?<br />-On Tuesday we will only be petitioning for my race.&nbsp; I think we will only petition for my race throughout June, but that isn&#039;t set in stone.<br /><br />I&#039;d like to ask you some questions after Monday. But appreciate all must be very busy early summer.<br />-Thanks.&nbsp; Always happy to answer questions.&nbsp; I want to work for you in the State legislature, so you have the right to ask me questions and expect answers.&nbsp; It&#039;s an extremely busy summer.&nbsp; I just left my job and will be campainging full time through the general election.&nbsp; My wife will be campaigning full time from July-September.&nbsp; It&#039;s an exciting experience, but also extremely busy.<br /><br />Hope to see you all tomorrow!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
