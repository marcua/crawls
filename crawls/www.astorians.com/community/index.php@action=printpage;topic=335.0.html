				Okay folks....her we go...<br /><br />We were thinking of starting an organized get together to kick of the beginning of summer. &nbsp;This event should be in Astoria, fun, cheap and have the potential for being a little crazy.<br /><br />What do you think about when you think of Astoria? Me, besides an overwhelming Greek population, those personal shopping carts that EVERYONE here seems to own. Shopping, laundry......a cheap walker to prop up your mortal remains.......why not make a rally using these carts! How about giving awards for best team rally time......best dressed cart ( this is where you really can get creative!)....best costumes ( this is where you can really get CRAZY!)...get the idea?<br /><br />Okay now, what should this rally be doing? SHOPPING of course! Now, this is where you all come in. WHAT do you shop for? We were thinking of giving teams identical shopping lists of items that could then be pressed into service at a picnic in the Park...Astoria Park of course.<br />Can you picture the scene of this motley crew of contestants rolling into Astoria Park afterwards, ready to party? ......can anyone say TOGA?.............<br />But I digress......this whole thing probably should take place sometime around the summer solstice...on a weekend. YOU FOLKS would need to submit ideas....hey, spring has just started, you've got plenty of time, as to how to get this thing going, what we should be shopping for, perhaps even where to shop.<br />GO FOR IT!<br />Intersted parties can email: granny.cart@gmail.com<br />..........or just post replies here.

				hey mister!<br /><br />i think this is a GREAT idea! <br />but i think we should change 'granny' to 'Queens'. i always call my cart the &quot;Queens Cart&quot; b/c everyone in Queens has one. (or, at least i thought.)<br /><br />i love my Queens cart. i have a very good relationship with it, although i abuse it sometimes.... too much laundry, or moving heavy things around in it...etc. <br /><br />being that i'm a 'crafty' person, i would love to decorate my cart.... this is so awesome! can anyone guess what colors mine are going to be? ;)<br /><br />this is a great idea. i dont know what you have in mind for the theme or purpose of this rally. the first thing that comes to mind is that our carts kind of represent us as a community. but we are all different people who live in the same community and can come together to realize and CELEBRATE our similarities and our differences. <br /><br />maybe if everyone brings the cart decorated to represent themselves. or to have the cart carry something that represents themselves. or if we are going to have a picnic in the park, to have the cart carry all the supplies and things we are going to contribute to the picnic. <br /><br />races would be totally fun. :)<br /><br />dude, i was throwing this idea around with someone before. a SCAVENGER HUNT where all the items you get have to come from Astoria. maybe we could utilize that &quot;shopping&quot; list thing into it, and carry all our stuff back in our cart.... or whatever. <br /><br />another idea: we could use the time to share and talk about our favorite things, shops, eats, in astoria, like a best of contest and announce them or whatever. best pizza, best bar, best Tea (who will that go to? ;) ), coolest bench spot, best place to catch a soccer match, etc...<br /><br />and i'm rambling... who else wants to do this? i think this is a fun idea!

				...i admit i use my stroller like this. (have you seen me balance my laundry on top of the stroller, with sam inside?)... would technicalities count? would your cart have to have been bought in astoria?<br /><br />i like the idea a lot. hee. (i had been wondering if it would be possible to hold an art festival under the triborough bridge... but this sounds like more fun.)<br /><br />perhaps each team would be given a particular item (chocolate mouse, for instance)... and they have to get at least three examples from different places. that way, you could combine the picnic with the best of astoria thing...<br /><br />anyway, neat idea. :)<br /><br />cheers,<br />alia

				Well, with my knee I wouldnt be racing my cart but I would like to decorate it up some. I think decorating it is a good idea cause it would make them unique and different. &nbsp;I am looking forward to a picnic. Rosemary, I definately know what colors yours would be.

				I am loosely basing this on a road rally I used to attend religously for 9 of its ten years. It was known as &quot; Aspluh &quot;. ....maybe somebody has heard of it?......immaterial, I know.<br />&nbsp;What I do remember is how this event evolved and what was done differently.<br />&nbsp;First, they had a similar idea, ie; different teams buying different food stuffs. The end of the race the 3 doz. hot dog buns and 6 jars of relish, ketchup, and mustard....were all still waiting for the hot dogs to finally giveup, get unlossed or bailed out of jail and join the rest of us.<br />&nbsp;* Remedy! *<br />&nbsp;Get it catered or at least have some people doing prep work at the final stop.<br />&nbsp;Second, they tried to sell t-shirts to cover costs. What happened was those shirts were like woodstock 69 tickets...everybody wanted one to say they were there...nine years later.<br />&nbsp;* Remedy! *<br />&nbsp;You pay, per person, a fixed fee at the start....I believe my Rally was $20.00. Believe me a real deal too....bought you a special, limited run T-shirt, a drinking vessel, a shot at three large dust collectors for the mantel of your ski house and....we learned this from a few close calls....does not really aply to this instance with the carts but worth mentioning...a spot at a campsite...usually as far away from anyone else as humanly possible...so nobody travels home DWI. Good idea really......fall in the campfire....don't drive....swimming at night is not encouraged either.<br />&nbsp; Obviously there wil not be......should not be.......but pagans will be pagans.....any open fires and I doubt if sleeping in the park would be allowed either....so .....coffee for everyone!<br /><br />!!!!!!!!!!!**************** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;JUNE 18, 2005 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;********************!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />&nbsp;A saturday, the weekend before the solstice, far enough from July 4th not to cramp anyones style and warm enough....hopefully, to dress freely.

				right on dude. <br /><br />but i'm sure you'll talk things out with other people who are interested regarding tweaking the event so that it suits our community.<br /><br />i dont like this whole hotdog idea. not to say that i've never been guilt of it, but in general, i dont like to waste food. so sharing food is good. i just dont think it's a good idea to do this assembling hot dogs and stuff as part of the contest and stuff. am i understanding your idea correctly? i dont think i am. please clarify if possible. <br /><br />a fee? i dont know if i wanna pay a fee for dressing up funky and running around with my Queens Cart on a weekend. i do this on a regular basis. ;) since this is the first year for this possible event, maybe it would be ok to start charging if it does become a big deal in the future. <br /><br />and i drink tea. not coffee. ;)

				Yeah, I was just mentioning how the past road rally was conducted, they had alot more invested in this stuff...I was also discussing this with Meesh and thought that a &quot;pot Luck&quot; meal brought at the beginning of the rally along with a folding chair could be pressed into service later...negating a need for any $...unless we need a permit from the Parks Dept.....another thing that needs to be looked into. If a tent fly, folding tables, etc are wanted.....they need to be factored in. A tarp and a few blankets should suffice. The chairs and food could be left at FreezePeach until later...commemorative T-Shirts could be discussed. <br />&nbsp;The anecdote about the hotdogs was to illustrate how NOT to do this with people responsable for main entry food stuffs still out on the course somewhere....<br />&nbsp;We're getting there....I am beginning to really like the Toga idea...
