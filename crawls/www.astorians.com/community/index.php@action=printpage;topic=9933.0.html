				I&quot;m eight and a half months pregnant. I wanted something cheaper, smaller, and manageable in small stores and aisles. The graco snap-and-go is small, fifty bucks, and you would get the carrier that snaps right into it. This will take you till the babe is about 8 months? I thnk but it depends on your baby. Then, they outgrow it and you get a bigger one. I chose the Maclaren as it is narrow, easy to maneuver and good quality. That is my take on these, and ai[m just about ready to roll. I solicited a LOT of parents to get this info.

				Before you buy a stroller, please check with the <span class="bbc_u">Consumer Product Safety Commission</span> (http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prerel.html) to be sure it hasn&#039;t been recalled for a safety issue. It&#039;s also not a bad idea to also check with Consumer Reports.

				When our baby was first born we had a Graco car seat that snaps into the stroller bottom. It was handy and easy to fold up, once you figured it out.<br /><br />We&#039;ve got a Maclaren that I like a lot.&nbsp; It&#039;s very common in the city, because it&#039;s reasonably priced (little over $100), relatively light, folds up easily and has storage underneath.&nbsp; There are definitely higher end models out there, but ours has held up pretty well over the past year or so.<br /><br />However, you might not have the same needs as we do.&nbsp; We don&#039;t have a car, so we&#039;re lifting the stroller up stairs to the subway all the time.

				Congratulations!<br /><br />When I had my son (almost 8 years ago) I had a pricy Peg Pergo.&nbsp; It was nice, had the ability to lie him flat&nbsp; in the stroller so I could use it while he was an infant.&nbsp; However, it was big, wide &amp; heavy!! I soon leaned that it was not that practical to walking around and frequent stores that are small.&nbsp; I used it for a few months and then got a smaller Peg Pergo (I think it was called Aria).&nbsp; That was much easier it use around Astoria &amp; it was much lighter, easier to fold, etc.<br /><br />Now with my daughter, I used the large Peg Pergo that I had used with my son but I only used it for a few months.&nbsp; Once she was able to sit up, I bought a lightwight Maclaran.&nbsp; So much better than the light weight Peg Perego (which I had gotten rid of because it did not hold up well after using it for 3+ years with my son).&nbsp; I still use the Maclaren, it is light, so easy to steer (even with one hand!).&nbsp; It folds very easy.&nbsp; The only minus that I found is that the basket is a little small.<br /><br />Hope that helps!!

				Thank you!&nbsp; I&#039;ll definitely look into the Maclaren - I like light weight and easy to fold!&nbsp;

				I used a Combi City Savvy for the first 18 months.&nbsp; It&#039;s very similar to the MacClaren already discussed, but you are able to snap in the infant seat when they are very little, and also fully reclines (I don&#039;t think the Mac does, but I&#039;m not sure).&nbsp; It&#039;s pretty cheap (around $100).<br />It was great because it is so light- I could easily lift it up subway stairs- and manuevers fairly well.&nbsp; However, I beat on it- we walk a ton and the thing was pretty busted up in 18mos.&nbsp; Also, I am 5&#039;8&quot;, and I wish the handles came up a bit higher- I found it to be a little rough on my back.<br />Recently, I purchased a City Mini by baby jogger, and so far I love it.&nbsp; It&#039;s a three-wheel type, but has the plastic wheels, so it&#039;s not technically a jogging stroller (they call it &quot;all terrain&quot;).&nbsp; The thing handles like a dream (haha I feel like I&#039;m talking about a ferrari) and folds incredibly easily with one hand.&nbsp; It&#039;s still fairly light, and I can get it up the stairs of the subway, but with a 25 pound kid in there, I try not to!<br />I have a lot of Mommy friends in the area now, and I&#039;d say 90% started with either the MacClaren or the Combi, and most have purchased some kind of three wheel model after a year or so.&nbsp; :-)
