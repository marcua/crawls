				I *hope* this is a really easy question for someone to answer, but I&#039;ve never bought one so I&#039;m not sure what store to go to. Actually, I&#039;d like two vanilla beans. One for the ice cream (http://www.davidlebovitz.com/recipes/vanilla_icecream.html) I&#039;d like to make this weekend, and another for some vanilla sugar (http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/recipes/recipe/0,1977,FOOD_9936_24170,00.html) for my coffee.<br /><br />I&#039;m in the Ditmars area but I have a car. And feet. And a Metrocard...but I&#039;d rather not go into Manhattan today, and duh, I can probably buy one right around the corner, right? Right?

				Call over to fresh start or Said&#039;s health food store on 30th ave. <br /><br />I bet that the Grand central market has them at the Penzy spice counter.

				Be very careful when purchasing these - the McCormick ones at Key Food are about $14!!!&nbsp; I have found them at Rosarios on 31st Street cheaper.

				Thanks guys! I ended up getting them at Fresh Start on 23rd Ave (between 31st &amp; 29th). They were pricey ($10 for 2 beans), but hopefully the things I make with them will be super delicious. :)<br /><br />I went to Best Yet after to do food shopping, and just out of curiosity, I checked the spice section, and they didn&#039;t have any.<br /><br />Also, when I called Fresh Start, the girl put me on hold to check if they were in stock, and when she came back, she said, &quot;we only have 1 left!&quot; (Meaning one little tube, there are 2 in a tube.) She then asked me if I wanted it to be put on hold, so yay for good customer service :)

				Allison, beware that 1 bean goes a long long way.&nbsp; We put 1 bean into a canister (1.5qt) of sugar and it was too strong.&nbsp; Using it for our morning coffee.&nbsp; Try half a bean and it&#039;s important to split it open to release the oils&nbsp; Will last a very very long time.&nbsp; Just keep adding sugar.<br /><br />Also try it in a bottle of bourbon, hot coco and cinnamon, a qt of good yogurt then drizzled with honey.&nbsp; <br /><br />Delicious.

				The best way to make vanilla sugar is putting *used* vanilla beans in the sugar. (Otherwise too strong.) You&#039;ll have the vanilla bean bubbling away w/ the cream when making your ice cream and should scrape out all the sticking bean center you can into the cream. There is plenty left you can&#039;t get at, which is why it&#039;s perfectly okay to still use. Just rinse the bean well, let it dry out overnight and stick it in your jar of sugar. I&#039;ve had one in my sugar for almost a year and it&#039;s still making deliciously flavored sugar. Every time I use a vanilla bean I stick another bean in there... But as you say, vanilla beans are expensive, and you should pay for them. You want to make sure the beans you are buying are top of the line and most importantly, not dried out. I don&#039;t know any place around Astoria that has them, but Whole Foods carries them for $10-14. Also, if you get one that is dried out, soak it in bourbon for a bit.

				Hmmm...well I already scraped out and put 1 bean&#039;s worth of seeds (and the pod) in about 2 cups of sugar (it&#039;s what Alton Brown told me to do!) so maybe I&#039;ll just buy another pound of sugar or something and put it all in a bigger container.<br /><br />The other bean is in the ice cream base that has been cooling in my fridge overnight, and I&#039;m going to churn it in a little while. I tasted it, and it tastes like....melted vanilla ice cream. But really tasty melted vanilla ice cream.<br /><br />Thanks for all the help guys!

				Mr. Brown is not always correct (just like most of us).&nbsp; Belle is right.&nbsp; Use the left over pod to flavor your sugar. Next time use the innards for the baked goods or other featured item.&nbsp; Also, some people prefer the pods as opposed to the seeds so that you don&#039;t look inot the sugar and see little black specs.&nbsp; Much like little bugs.&nbsp; But some people are sensitive like that.

				But....but....but....he&#039;s Alton Brown! Doesn&#039;t he know everything???&nbsp; :-P<br /><br />Should I just toss it, or should I just add a lot more sugar to dilute the vanilla-ness? (The seed specs don&#039;t bother me.)<br /><br />The ice cream is freakin&#039; awesome, btw. If any of you have an ice cream maker, you should totally make the recipe I linked in the first post of this thread. (Although the recipe never said when to add the &quot;few drops&quot; of vanilla extract, I just added it when I added the vanilla bean.)

				TOSS NOTHING!&nbsp; &nbsp;What are ya crazy?&nbsp; &nbsp;Just add more sugar to that goodness and keep adding sugar until months from now when you need to add more vanilla pod.&nbsp; Nothing ever goes to waste.&nbsp;
