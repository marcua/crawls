				I have to be honest - never meditated (officially, I suppose) and I have never gotten a &quot;real&quot; massage. So for the uninitiated where would you send me? Recommendations anyone?<br /><br />Don&#39;t mind if you make suggestions for Manhattan either if you don&#39;t know any around Astoria.

				There&#39;s always all those adds in the back of the Village Voice for &quot;body work&quot; and massages.&nbsp; :evil: :evil: :evil:<br /><br />But maybe that&#39;s not what you&#39;re looking for.&nbsp; Haha.&nbsp; <br /><br />In all seriousness, though,&nbsp; if you belong to a health club, like the Rock, or Equinox, you can get a massage there.&nbsp; It&#39;s a nice experience.&nbsp; Very relaxing.

				I can highly recommend a local certified massage therapist.&nbsp; I&#39;ll have to wait until I get home to post her contact information, but she&#39;s reasonable and very good.<br /><br />Also, you don&#39;t have to belong to the Rock to get a massage there.&nbsp; She&#39;s also very good, but more expensive.

				There&#39;s a really good meditation class at Grace Lutheran Church on 21st Ave @32nd St on Sundays at 12 noon.&nbsp; Its based on the Kadampa school of Buddhism, the most accessible to most Westerners, and led by a former Wall Street trader who&#39;s very funny.&nbsp; Normally we go in, sit for a while (1/2 hour or so) to clear our heads, then the leader speaks for a while on that topic, and then we sit again for 1/2 hour or so.&nbsp; I know he&#39;s got another class at Grace Lutheran on Mondays at 7pm, but I haven&#39;t been to that one, and I believe its more of a classy-class with books and all.&nbsp; Hope that helps.

I think she&#39;s awesome, and it was the most relaxing massage I&#39;ve had in ages. She has studied a bunch of different massage styles (I think she said she&#39;s studying at the Swedish Institute at the moment) and seems genuinely interested in her work. During my massages, she often talks to me about what&#39;s going on with my muscles and why. She really knows her stuff, and I never want it to end. It&#39;s also very affordable compared to what you&#39;d find in Manhattan.

				SPAce (http://www.salonspace.com/) website, with prices listed for their different offerings.&nbsp; Their basic hour massage appears to be $65, which is pretty reasonable.<br /><br />They&#39;re on Ditmars between 31st and 29th, a couple of doors down from La Guli.

				Has anyone tried Angel Spa on Steinway (near Broadway)? I&#39;ve been wanting to get a massage but would prefer not to travel up to the Ditmars area. Plus their prices seem to be reasonable...<br /><br />If you have a better suggestion in the area, I&#39;m open! Must note though, I&#39;m also cheap.

				I usually do tip around 15%, but then your question prompted me to go to Google and find that tipping is not really expected by massage therapists. This (http://frappydoo.com/forum/showthread.php?threadid=2622) is a good online discussion that you might want to read.<br /><br />After seeing that, I think I&#39;ll continue tipping Maria at SPAce, since I&#39;ve already established that practice. But with anyone else, I&#39;ll take into account whether or not they&#39;re already receiving the full fee and whether I&#39;m there for relaxation or therapy. It seems that some therapists feel just a little insulted if you tip, whereas no one feels insulted if you don&#39;t.

				You might like to try The Emerald Spa http://www.emeraldspa.net/<br />What&#39;s good about it is that you can use the spa facilities before topping it all off with a massage. <br />The best massage I&#39;ve gotten there was from a woman named Dina. You might want to ask for her.&nbsp; If you don&#39;t specify, there&#39;s a chance you might get a male therapist, which might make some women a tad uncomfortable.<br /><br />One big drawback they have, though, is that the showers in the women&#39;s locker room have NO COLD WATER - just scalding hot water, which renders them unusable. Apparently, this weird situation has been this way for a long time because there is a permanent sign in the locker room warning of this. Why they don&#39;t address the situation is beyond my understanding. I&#39;d go there more often if I could use the shower to wash the pool chlorine from my hair before leaving. As it is now, I have to go right home afterwards to shower, shampoo and dry my hair. I only live two blocks from there, but still it&#39;s a drag. I&#39;m sure it&#39;d be an even bigger drag for anyone who lives further away.
