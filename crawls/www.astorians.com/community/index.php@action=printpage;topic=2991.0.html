				<em>This was in the Splendid Table newsletter today, and I thought you guys might be interested.</em><br /><br />We received a listener question recently that I answered in my newspaper column, Ask the Splendid Table®, but I thought it would be handy for newsletter readers, too.<br /><br />The listener lives in St. Louis, where a recent storm knocked out power for several days. He and his wife had to pitch nearly everything in their refrigerator. Aside from the usual foods, they wanted to restock with &quot;new and exceptional things&quot; and asked for ideas. These were my thoughts:<br /><br />Organic whole milk yogurt stands in for sour and heavy creams in soups, dips and dressings, and is lush on its own. <br />Premium Japanese soy classes up take-out sushi and rubs for grilled foods (refrigeration keeps the sauce in excellent shape for a year). <br />Cultured butter tastes richer than regular butter. <br />Cold-pressed almond and walnut oils make everyday salads taste new, but they must be kept cold once opened. <br />Thai curry pastes (green and red) need a short simmer in coconut milk with your choice of chicken or fish, vegetables, a shot of lime or tamarind, and a finish of fresh herbs for a big bowl of eye-opening, sinus-clearing stew. <br />A brigade of fresh basil, rosemary, coriander, sage, thyme and marjoram mean you are never at a loss for a fast, fresh tasting sauté. Pitted Kalamata olives could go into those sautés along with zest from an orange, lemon or lime. <br />There always seems to be that citrus triumvirate of lemons, limes and oranges in the vegetable drawer. If they don&#39;t go into savory dishes, they end up squeezed into icy pitchers for summer coolers. And fresh lime juice, tequila and sugar shake into the lazy man&#39;s very fine Margarita. <br />I keep whole-grain flat breads (they keep longer in the refrigerator) like Caribbean-inspired lentil/legume roti and whole wheat tortillas for quesadillas, bastardized pizza, and for cutting up into bite-sized pieces and toasting with garlic and olive oil. Here is where that whole-milk yogurt with fresh coriander and a dash of Thai curry paste enter the picture as a topping for the perfect small bites with drinks. <br />Vastly, consider the foods which are meals unto themselves, as in a collection of keeping cheeses to serve as a main course with a few interesting condiments and a salad. You could stick to non-fragile American artisan cheeses and pick from Grafton cheddars, Vella Dry Jack, vacuum-packed fresh goat cheese, California&#39;s blue Humboldt Fog, Van Gogh from Roth Kase, Wisconsin&#39;s Mt. Pleasant cheese, and that state&#39;s Carr Valley cheeses. Group together a trio, flank them with condiments of dried fruits, salted nuts, or spiced chutneys and bread for a company supper. <br />I should add that nearly all the jars of condiments in the cupboard, once opened, end up in the refrigerator—so tamarind concentrate, Spanish pequillo peppers, Chinese Hoisin sauce, Romanian eggplant relish, Italian mustard fruits, and tapenade from France nearly crowd out the fresh items coming in every week. <br />Take your pick of what sounds new and interesting. But beware—you, too, will join the ranks of those who&#39;ve not seen the backs of their refrigerators since the Clinton administration.<br />

				this is an excellent questions (and answer). i, too, was a little overwhelmed by the clean slate that was handed to me by con-ed. it felt like an opportunity to add some new items to my tired refrigerator standards.<br /><br />that said, i started with the basics: dijon mustard, soy sauce, sriracha, butter, eggs, milk, ketchup, onion, red pepper and lemons. i would have gotten more on my inaugural restack run, but i couldn&#39;t carry anything else.

When my children were still living at home, I used to have to keep doubles of so much—like ketchup. One for the refrigerator, one in the cabinet. The same with (if memory serves me correctly) 3 different kinds of mustards (that&#39;s 6 jars), and all those jams, preserves and jellies; peanut butter—who liked creamy or chunky, refrigerated or not . . .<br /><br />My dining room table used to look like a grocery store on weekend mornings when we all sat down to eat breakfast together. Every jam, preserve and jelly in the house piled in the middle of the table; who wanted ground black pepper with their eggs and who wanted cracked black pepper; Kosher salt or iodized . . .<br /><br />I jes looooove living alone! Now I can actually see what is in *my* refrigerator!

				normally i would have no need for the most pedestrian of condiments, but my wife and i have developed quite an appetite for tater tots. i know. i know. it&#39;s kind of pathetic. but they taste so goooooood and can be prepared in a toaster oven thereby not heating the house too much.<br /><br />as for multiples, we strive for an incredible variety of items without repeats. you never know when you might need 1 of 6 different types of vinegar.

				Well, I just decided to restock on Monday, and I discovered chopped basil in the jar (with olive oil?), as opposed to the dry seasoning.&nbsp; Now I know that fresh is best, but having the jar handy is great when you can&#39;t run to the store all the time.

				Well, I keep neither hot sauces nor vinegars in my fridge, but they plus other sauces and condiments such as mustards and nam pla take up one entire cupboard shelf.&nbsp; Vinegars:&nbsp; white, white wine, red wine, sherry, rice, tarragon, raspberry, ume plum, brown rice, malt, apple cider and balsamic.&nbsp; <br /><br />Phew.&nbsp; I&#39;ll figure out the hot sauces when I&#39;ve recovered.&nbsp; But it&#39;s about that, including five kinds of Tabasco and three or four Bufalo brand hot sauces from Mexico, Tapatio and El Yucateco habanero.&nbsp; And then there&#39;s the malagueta talisca, which is basically malagueta peppers in vinegar, so I suppose it could go in either category.&nbsp; &nbsp;8-)

				Vinegars--let me see, I have red wine, white wine, balsamic, white balsamic, strawberry flavored, cider, sherry, white wine with tarragon, and in the bathroom, white.<br /><br />Not all of them are open.<br /><br />I always buy my balsamic vinegar in a cylindrical bottle so I can use it as a rolling pin for small jobs.<br /><br />BTW I just defrosted my fridge and I took the occasion to give it a thorough cleaning, throwing out most of the stuff I had in it.&nbsp; (I even found some gunk that must have been left over from the George H.W. Bush administration.)&nbsp; I&#39;ll come back to this thread.
