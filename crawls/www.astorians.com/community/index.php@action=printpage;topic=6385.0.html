				Hey!<br /><br />I&#039;d like to invite crafters, indie business entrepeneurs and anyone who likes to play with others in a setting that involves creative endeavors to come to a general interest meeting on Wednesday, May 23 at 7 p.m. I know some people had expressed they could not make the Astoria Crafty Knitty times, and this group would in fact be a separate entity so as to expand to other ventures and to preserve the ACK as it stands.<br /><br />Let&#039;s get together and discuss the possibility of starting a group with regular meetings, events and workshops-- and even consider creating an Astoria craft mafia, if people are so inclined.<br /><br />If you plan on coming, suggest a meeting spot (I know Tell Astorya was mentioned) and let me know you will be there! Sure I could go and craft by myself on Wednesday, but that wouldn&#039;t be as fun-- so if this is gonna happen, get on board and say hello! <br /><br />Info about the craft mafia-ness can be found at: www.craftmafia.org.<br /><br />Two things I will point out about starting that in Astoria: it involves a yearly membership fee and requires at least three creative members with different businesses (online counts) to start a group. Members do get the benefits of being part of a larger network, which is helpful in getting a name out there.<br />

				I guess we need to firm up where we&#039;re meeting.&nbsp; As far as coffee/cafes I know on this side of Astoria Blvd. there&#039;s TellAstorya, Esparks, Himalaya teahouse, and a few Starbucks.&nbsp; What do you think?

				I definitely want to pop in, but i have a friend from out of town i might be having dinner with. If not, i will shoot up there.<br />Do we have a set location?<br />If it&#039;s Tell Astorya, is that the one that doesn&#039;t serve alcohol or is that Time Cafe that doesn&#039;t?<br />This week blows, i&#039;ll be wanting a drink on hump day.&nbsp; :-D

				Oh! And how should we recognize each other? Do I need to call this place ahead of time? I figure if we are just chatting and hanging out for now we don&#039;t really need to inform them what we are doing just yet... you know, until there&#039;s like, paint brushes and crafty elements strewn about.<br /><br />I could wear a certain color and be a huge dork like that.<br /><br />Keep me posted!<br /><br />

				Tell Astorya is relatively small- they have various tea, coffee, and snack items.&nbsp; It&#039;s very low-key and laid back.&nbsp; We should be able to recognize each other by crafting accessories and our general crafty cool aura.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think a tentative agenda is just introductions and discuss options for craft meetings including locations, dates, specialties, etc.&nbsp; Anything else we need to add?

				wait...are we crafting or is this just a general &quot;sit down&quot; to discuss what we want to do.<br /><br />If they&#039;re small it wouldn&#039;t be conducive to crafting.

				So the plan is tonight at 7pm at Tell Astorya?<br /><br />I am as of now not sure I will end up making it this time. I have come down with a pretty bad case of bronchitis. I will see how I am feeling by tonight. But, if I don&#039;t make it I am 100% still interested in joining up with the group once it gets going. Normally Wednesdays are a good day.<br /><br />

				Just a quick meeting recap for those who missed it-<br />We will be meeting Wednesdays, 7pm at TellAstorya.<br />Three crafters attendend- representing yarn, jewelry, and paper crafts.<br /><br />For next week we will be working on a group name.&nbsp; Also, we are brainstorming ideas for a crafty summer kick-off bash at the end of June.&nbsp; We&#039;re also going to have a bit of works-in-progress craft time and a bit of finished work show-and-tell.<br /><br />I think I got everything- did I?

				Yup, you got it, Darcee!<br /><br />It was so fun to sit down and chat with you ladies yesterday-- I&#039;m already excited for next week.<br /><br />I hope to meet everyone else next week, and as I was walking home yesterday-- I passed that Himalaya Tea House and noticed they have a cute outdoor eatery area, perhaps we could try there instead next week if the weather is nice?<br /><br />You think in case, if we are bringing materials, we should clear it with the owners/managers first?<br /><br /><br />&lt;3 Rachel<br />

				I posted this in the other thread, but figured I would post it here. <br /><br />Hey everyone. I live in Astoria and I am a member of the NYC Craft Mafia. The New York City Craft Mafia has signed an agreement with Austin to be the exclusive craft mafia within the 5 buroughs of New York. We may be taking in some new members in the near future, If you are interested in membership, please visit our website www.newyorkcitycraftmafia.com.<br /><br />Last weekend we did a supply swap at etsy labs in Brooklyn. How great would it be to do something like that in Queens? The two we have done so far have been a huge success! One of our other members, Veronica Soto is also from Astoria. So we do have a bit of Astoria representation. <br /><br />It would be awesome though to get a craft group together in Astoria. Even if it isnt the Craft Mafia! I would totally be game for craft get togethers or mini labs or figuring out some craft events in the area. I sew and make soap and dabble in other things. <br /><br />My website is www.bejessie.com. Are you guys still meeting up locally?<br />
