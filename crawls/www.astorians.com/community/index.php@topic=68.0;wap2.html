			<strong>Bookbinder</strong>:
			<br />
			a new Japanese cuisine restaurant called WATAWA has recently [2 weeks ago] opened! &nbsp;its located at 33-10 Ditmars Blvd. &nbsp;and i gotta tell ya, its delicious! &nbsp;and cheap! &nbsp;i just had the best vegetable tempura and miso soup. &nbsp;their list of sushi is quite impressive. &nbsp;and the best part - they didnt mind me staying long after i finished my meal to just sit and have 2 pots of green tea while i wrote some letters to friends. <br />&nbsp;<br />it was a bit odd though to hear the party of seven behind me talking of how one of them has &quot;really strong toes!&quot; &nbsp; :shock:

			I must agree!! &nbsp;I ate at Watawa about 2 days after it opened (as it's a block away from me), and since then I've eaten there/ordered delivery probably 3 or 4 more times.<br /><br />I've had better miso soup, but the sushi was quite delicious and affordable.

			I did not care for the dressing on the salads that they used, but their sashimi was delicious. Nice and fresh and melts in your mouth goodness. From the food alone I would never guess that Chinese people run the place. I love the decor and atmosphere as well, very pleasing to the eyes and very relaxing.

			What's your opinion on &quot;Go Wasabi&quot;?

			I really like Go Wasabi. &nbsp;Never actually eaten there, always had delivery. &nbsp;Before Go Wasabi, and now, I guess, this new place, the only sushi places were really scary bad, so I'm happy they've arrived.
