				Where are there some good bookstores in Astoria? It seems like there really aren't any in the Ditmars area unless I am totally out of it. I found a great used bookstore yesterday at Broadway and 34th or something similar, but I'd like to know if there are others as well. Easily accessible by subway would be preferable also.

				hi wasabisam. saw your post about the lack of bookstores in astoria. its not just you. i havent found a single one. that sells used books - hand picked by people who actually like to read - with sofas near a window somewhere to hang out for awhile. maybe pick up a conversation with someone...<br /><br /><br /><br />although slightly out of the way for astorians, the GOTHAM BOOKSTORE in midtown, and STRAND books on Broadway, near Soho are both great. Gotham is this tiny old basement place, thats packed full of well chosen used and new books - and the kids that work there love to read. Strand is bigger, slightly less personal - but still rad.<br /><br /><br /><br />I just pulled the following address off the net for Gotham... i would highly recommend it to anyone who &nbsp;not only loves to read - but loves books, and everything that goes with them<br /><br /><br /><br />Gotham Book Mart<br /><br />41 W. 47th St. (Midtown West)<br /><br />near Sixth Ave.<br /><br />212-719-4448<br /><br /><br /><br />ff

				I visited Strand a few months ago - I like it, except it seems a little unorganized and confined. I suppose that is kind of what you get when you go to a used bookstore - you're never going to really find exactly what you are looking for unless you go hunting for it for hours.<br /><br />I will have to try out Gotham. Sounds like it is in the Times Square area which would be fairly easy for me (except having to dodge all the tourists! &nbsp;:wink: ).

				Maybe since there aren't any great bookstores in Astoria we should start some sort of book club where we can trade or borrow books to read from each other. What do you think?

				There *is* a bookstore on Broadway. &nbsp;It is a bit small but I like it. &nbsp;It's called &quot;Book Value&quot; and it's on the steinway side of the tracks, with a big green awning. &nbsp;I've found some good deals there, and the owners are very nice, or at least they were the last time I was over that way.

				This topic hits close to home! &nbsp;Or at least potential home. &nbsp;I may be moving to the 31st St &amp; Steinway Ave area soon and I'm wondering if there are any bookstores nearby. &nbsp;I've been spoiled living in Brooklyn with BookCourt being a few blocks away.

				Maybe finding a local bookstore isn't the solution for our community then... Until there is a full-fledged bookstore in the Ditmars area, maybe we'll just have to hike it to Manhattan.<br /><br />Another idea is to start a book share network. For instance - say I want to read the new book, &quot;The Historian&quot; by Elizabeth Kostova (and I do) but don't want to pay full-price for it, and one of you had it and was willing to lend it to me or trade it for something of mine that you wanted to read (perhaps &quot;The Other Boleyn Girl&quot; by Philippa Gregory which I do have) - then we could swap it. How could we get something like this going?<br /><br />I usually use Half.com to buy books I want to read, but this might be a good way to get books around the neighborhood without spending any money or at least without having to keep buying books all the time.<br /><br />Maybe we could all list the books that we each have available for trade or borrowing and list all the books we were interested in... Hmmm... still needs some thought...<br /><br />So - your thoughts, oh great readers of Astoria?

				I wish there was some local institution that would host a book co-op or something. Ya know? You could join. If we had one, lots of my books would end up there. I often end up donating them or selling them unless I *love* them. Maybe a church or something would do it. I dunno. <br /><br />PS. Its not just the Ditmars area. The &quot;bookstore&quot; on Broadway is useless. I started a petition pleading with them to alphabetize thier stock. <br />http://www.petitiononline.com/books4us/petition.html

				That might work, maybe we could even create a new message board like this but just for people to list and trade books. I have some books I can share. I just threw out a whole mess of them but I do have some more to go through that I can share.
