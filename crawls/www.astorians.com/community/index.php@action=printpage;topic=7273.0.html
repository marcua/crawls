				A pound of their unsliced lox.&nbsp; (It&#039;s $12/lb.)&nbsp; Absolutely the best.&nbsp; They&#039;re great about letting you try things, too, which is nice.

				Their whitefish salad/spread is the BEST.&nbsp; Funny story... We were at someone&#039;s apt and they served whitefish spread to go with crackers during a little cocktail party.&nbsp; I commented that it was delicious.&nbsp; I tell the story how I find Acme to be the best and that it&#039;s in most supermarkets in small round containers, etc etc.&nbsp; She said she bought hers at Costco and shows us a large white tub.&nbsp; I was surprised.&nbsp; The next time we&#039;re in Costco we see the large tub of whitefish spread near the cheeses and salmon.&nbsp; We buy it.&nbsp; After getting it home and looking more closely at the tub, it says - in small print - manufactured at Acme Smoked Fish in Brooklyn!

				non eventful.&nbsp; Found the place with no problem.&nbsp; Parked with no problem.&nbsp; Had there not been someone else walking in at the same time as me I would have had a problem.&nbsp; I was expecting a &quot;showroom.&quot; Ha!&nbsp; Just a refrigerated room at the back of the garage.&nbsp; &nbsp;I Wild Salmon, Sable (Carp), a White fish (YUMM) and some packaged stuff - including the Salmon pastrami - which I really liked, but weirded out the rest of the family.... what is it?? Pastrami?? or Salmon???&nbsp; I bought WAY too much food - but we sent all the leftovers back to CT with the mishpacha.&nbsp; <br /><br />Gotta say - although I loved the fish - I found everything TOOOOO salty.&nbsp; <br /><br />
