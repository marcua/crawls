				One place that&#039;s nice for a drink if you&#039;re in the area is the new Hilton on 42nd between 7th &amp; 8th Ave.<br />It&#039;s one or two doors down from the AMC movie theatre. They have a bar/lounge when you take the <br />elevator up to the main level. It might be a little pricey for drinks, but when my boyfriend and I first <br />started seeing each other, we used to go up there after a movie. <br /><br />It&#039;s got a great view, comfortable and you can also get something to eat if the evening progresses well and<br />you want to linger a little. <br /><br />Plus the location is good for mid-town.

				Looking to impress? The Oak Room at The Plaza. For a snooty experience try the Campbell Apartment Bar in Grand Central. (dress appropriate- no sneaks). The bar at the Marriot in Times Square is pretty cool- you can sit and watch the action down below. The Hudson Hotel has a snappy little bar as well.

				The Shalel Lounge on the upper west side!!! Your date will be impressed as it&#039;s more of a &quot;hidden find&quot; - you&#039;d walk right past without even knowing it&#039;s there!

				I would highly recommend &quot;Your Couch&quot; - you can control the atmosphere, the drink selection and if the date blows, you don&#039;t have to worry about waiting for 45 minutes for an N to show up on a weekend.
