A grab-bag of choreographic tactics focus on working with the architecture of a site to pull images and meaning from its components. Techniques for researching a site and exploring its possibilities in movement; finding hidden meaning in a space and developing methods to amplify it; and issues of staging, storyboarding, and choreographing for the camera will be introduced through a series of focused exercises.<br /><br />$35 if registered by May 2nd/$40 at door<br />Film Screening<br /><br />Tuesday May 17th 8-10pm<br /><br />Join us for an evening of Dance for Camera curated by Zach Morris of Third Rail Projects and The Dance Film Lab.

This Kinetic Cinema focuses on films that utilize dance/movement created in relation to furniture, props, or the built landscape--examining how filmakers and choreographers are using environments to build dramatic tension, elucidate meaning, and further their narratives.<br /><br />Zach Morris is a Bessie Award-winning choreographer whose work includes site-specific performances, installation art, video and multi-media projects, and immersive performance environments. He is particularly interested in creating projects that place contemporary art and performance in non-traditional contexts.<br />Zachâ€™s work has been seen internationally, at several theaters around the U.S. and at numerous venues in New York City. He is Co-Director of Third Rail Projects, an NYC arts organization dedicated to bringing art to the public through an array of media; organizer and moderator of the NYC Dance Film Lab; creator of the annual Steampunk Haunted House in New York City; and serves as adjunct faculty for Florida State University.
