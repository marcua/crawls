				I heard good things about this Pizza Place so I decided to give it a try on Saturday and I was pleasantly surprised.&nbsp; Now I see why people rave about this pizza.&nbsp; It&#039;s thin crust pizza and the crust is so light and crispy.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t even attempt to fold my slice like I usually do because I felt like the crust would break in half so I ate in without folding.&nbsp; It was very hot, just the way I like it and the sauce was perfect and also the amount of cheese.&nbsp; I enjoyed it so much and couldn&#039;t believe how good it was and while I was sitting there eating my slice, a lady who works there came around handing out complimentary mini cannollies.&nbsp; That was delicious too.&nbsp; I will definitely be going back to Rizzo&#039;s whenever I&#039;m on Steinway

				I remember when my brother and I were kids that my mom would take us there as a special treat if were shopping on Steinway. Rizzo&#039;s was always the bribe that made us behave. She would promised to take us there<br />after her errands if we were good and didn&#039;t give her any trouble. It was actually the only time we did behave!<br />I haven&#039;t been there in years, but good to know it&#039;s still up to par!

				I also grew up with Rizzo&#039;s being a highlight stop while family shopping. Their recipe remains the same after all these years.

				It&#039;s the ONLY good pizza in Astoria. Every place else tries to hide the fact that they have no flavor by adding 30 pounds of cheese. No thanks.

				This tastes like real homemade Italian pizza.&nbsp; Now a lot of times when you go for pizza they are run by hispanics.&nbsp; They don&#039;t know how to make a real Italian pizza.&nbsp; The sauce they make isn&#039;t good or the crust and grease drips from the slice while you eat it.

				Rizzo&#039;s is the best in the neighborhood. On a related note, Retro Pizza on Broadway by the library is also quite good. They have a Margharita worth checking out.

In fact they probably made the bagels you eat in the morning at Brooklyn Bagel and Italian pastries at Rose &amp; Joe&#039;s and the sushi at whatever place and so on and so forth. Even in Italy the workers in pizzerias/trattorias are not always native but immigrants from other&nbsp; countries. Just because a pizza has what you call &quot;grease dripping from it&quot; doesn&#039;t mean that it&#039;s of inferior quality. Most true pizzaioli will drizzle olive oil on the pizza before putting into the oven and some do it afterwards. In any event Rizzo&#039;s isn&#039;t what I&#039;d consider true Italian quality. But it is a quality NY slice.
