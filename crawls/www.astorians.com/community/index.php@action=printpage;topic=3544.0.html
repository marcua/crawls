				So after reading the &quot;Tacos&quot; posts, I started to think about dinner, and my thoughts became more refined as I saw a passing reference to Papa&#39;s Empanadas and Mundo.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am new to the world of empanadas (having also only recently disovered arepas), and I would love to try some in the &#39;hood.&nbsp; The question is like this: my wife and I have certain dietary restrictions such that we don&#39;t eat meat or chicken out - we do, however, eat fish, veggies, and dairy.&nbsp; Do any of the empanadas places have enough of a variety of things we can eat (e.g., rice and beans, veggie, cheese) to make it worth our while?&nbsp; If so, which one?<br /><br />I don&#39;t want to get into the whole question of whether lard is used in the dough or beans or whatever- that&#39;s in the &quot;don&#39;t ask, don&#39;t tell&quot; category of knowledge.<br /><br />thanks!<br />bennyt

				Papa&#39;s Empanadas has a great selection of veggie empanadas and desert empanadas.&nbsp; They have cheese, spinach, peanut butter/chocolate, cherry/chocolate and a few others.&nbsp; Do you eat eggs?&nbsp; They have a number of egg based empanadas.

				yo.&nbsp; just ate at Papa&#39;s.&nbsp; Plenty we could eat.&nbsp; Queso, guava and queso (good), fig caramel and queso (really good), rice and bean, falafel (not recommended so much), and of course, the Elvis.<br /><br />Next time, will have to try the mac &#39;n cheese, which I noticed on the menu after I had already ordered...<br /><br />Good time.&nbsp; Thanks for your help.<br />bennyt

				I didn&#39;t know they had mac and cheese empanadas.&nbsp; That sounds divine.&nbsp; I think the cherry and chocolate are the best right now.

				I forgot to mention the plantain and queso- that&#39;s pretty damn good too.<br /><br />One thing that I found kind of interesting is that the empanada &quot;shell&quot; is different, depending on the filling.&nbsp; There is the standard deep-fried yellow-ish one, but then there&#39;s a baked doughy white one (which came with the falafel, and if I remember correctly, the rice and beans), plus even in the standard category there is some variation (e.g., crimped vs. folded edges).&nbsp; Interesting.<br /><br />

				Papa&#39;s Empanadas is on Steinway on the East Side of the Street just North of 26th Avenue.&nbsp; It&#39;s walkable from Lower Astoria and they deliver (but make them read it back, they&#39;re not so great on getting deliveries right).&nbsp; The quality of the food more than makes up for that.

				I&#39;ve had mac and cheese&nbsp; --&nbsp; it was, not quite right.<br /><br />I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s good or bad.<br /><br />But this is also from the person who hates the deep fried oreo.

				there&#39;s also a smaller Mama&#39;s Empanadas on Greenpoint Ave.<br />same awning, just Mama instead of Papa. I was very tempted, but i think my mommy&#39;s would probably be better. &nbsp;:wink:

				There is a Mama&#39;s Empanada&#39;s in Hell&#39;s Kitchen too.&nbsp; Great stuff, though pricier than Papa&#39;s.&nbsp; Ruben&#39;s Empanada&#39;s has a number of locations as well.

				I think Ruben&#39;s is more meat heavy, but Mama&#39;s has vegetarian options, though not as extensive as Papa&#39;s.&nbsp; I&#39;ll see if I can rustle up one of their menus.&nbsp; My bf is a vegetarian and we get to Mama&#39;s with some regularity, so I know they vegetarian empanadas.

				I&#39;ve also had deep-fried mac &#39;n cheese in other contexts (e.g., at Homer&#39;s on the Upper West Side), and it&#39;s pretty righteous.<br /><br />One thing I don&#39;t recommend, though, is the deep-fried pickle at the Park Slope Ale House.&nbsp; Not so good.<br /><br />bennyt<br />
