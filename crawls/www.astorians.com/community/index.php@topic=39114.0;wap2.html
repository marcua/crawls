			<br />Starting off the new year Randomly:<br /><br />I bought a packet of Turtles on post-Christmas sale and looked up the history of the company.&nbsp; This bio contains some interesting commentary on what life was like for women 100 years ago. <br /><br />http://www.demetscandy.com/demets/half-a-century-in-food-service/

			Since we&#039;re talking about random turtles, did you know that there is a turtle that lives in the fountain/pond on the corner of 28th Street and Ditmars? Every once in a while I catch him as he pops his head up above the water&#039;s surface. So cute!

			I didn&#039;t know, and I&#039;m glad you told me.&nbsp; Is the fountain/pond something the turtle might be able to stay in when the weather gets cold?&nbsp; Otherwise I&#039;ll have to wait till spring to go see it.&nbsp; Which corner is the turtle corner?

The fountain/pond is on the southeast corner of the intersection. The guys that live there have made that corner a lovely little spot. Their landscaping work is really nice and lots of neighbors love stopping by to see the fish, and the flowers that bloom each year. Their light displays for Halloween and Christmas are awesome, too.
