				I decided to move the topic on Astoria/suburban vs. urban here.<br /><br />We definitely come from different perspectives, daisy.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)<br /><br />I don&#39;t consider Astoria to be suburban, and certainly wouldn&#39;t attach the term &quot;suburbia&quot;, what with its strong negative connotations.&nbsp; I&#39;ve lived in what I think is the quintessential suburban area of the country, the single story tract home of Southern California.&nbsp; And I&#39;ve lived in Suffolk County on Long Island, which is also suburban bordering on exurban.&nbsp; It troubles me to think that the presence of nature is thought of as distinctly suburban, whereas I believe there is nature even in the city, not to mention the inner city, like south central LA.&nbsp; Squirrels and ants are everywhere, not to mention the ever present sparrow which lives in a variety of environments.&nbsp; Pigeons are everywhere, too, and to me actually seem more of a city bird than anything.&nbsp; <br /><br />Astoria has single family homes, but those homes are also split into flats, and there&#39;s the big apartment buildings that are everywhere, even down by the park (thinking 23rd Ave and 21st Street), and even smaller apartment buildings (Ditmars near 19th Street).&nbsp; Not to mention that set of giant apartment buildings near the power plant.&nbsp; <br /><br />For me, suburban areas also primarily bedroom communities, where goods and services are found primarily in the city further away, save for giant supermakets; big box stores are more exurban, but also suburban, so yes, Costco follows that (but as I said, I see it as an anomaly).&nbsp; And the zoning is quite extreme in the suburbs, where residential and commercial don&#39;t necessarily exist one next to the other.&nbsp; &nbsp;Suburban development eschews the concept of density, and is more accommodating to sprawl, although the exurban communities are more guilty of that.&nbsp; There is lots of residential/housing in Astoria, but it&#39;s interspersed with commercial.<br /><br />I also associate suburbs with &quot;white flight&quot; and for suburbs to be ethnically/demographically homogenous, which I don&#39;t find Astoria to be.&nbsp; Sure there are cars here, but they are everywhere.&nbsp; However, we don&#39;t have the ubiquitous cul-de-sac, which is another defining suburban element, I think used for traffic calming.&nbsp; Suburbs also don&#39;t favor reasonable, if not convenient, public transportation, and emphasize car culture.&nbsp; <br /><br />I do agree that there are cities/towns in Queens that are more suburban, especially as you head toward Nassau County, which I see as fully suburban.&nbsp; But I just can&#39;t associate Astoria with the term suburban.&nbsp; I moved here with the perception that is wasn&#39;t suburban, but more urban.&nbsp; Urban doesn&#39;t equal loud and fast always, too.&nbsp; I think there are various kinds of urban, moreso than&nbsp; suburban. Thanks, though, for your perspective.&nbsp; I would be interested in hearing other views on this.<br /><br /><br /><strong>daisy said:</strong><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I grew up in upstate ny.&nbsp; With lots of houses, cars, and huge department stores.&nbsp; I feel in some subconscious way, I was drawn to Queens (not just Astoria) because it tends to remind me of life upstate.&nbsp; I don&#39;t get this same feel from Brooklyn or the Bronx - although I&#39;m sure the further you go out in these areas the more houses you&#39;ll find and the more suburban it will get.&nbsp; &nbsp;Queens for the most part has more houses than apartment buildings (minus the new developments), parking spots next to those houses, and very huge department stores.&nbsp; It is only now that the department stores are invading Manhattan but Queens had them for a long time.&nbsp; Home Depot, Stop and Shop, Pathmark, NSW Warehouse, Sterns before Target, JCPenney, Costco, that huge Queenscenter Mall, etc.&nbsp; I like Astoria because I find it&#39;s much quieter on scale than Manhattan (perhaps not Broadway but lots of other areas are quiet), people here actually know each other and smile on the street to one another, and it has a small town feel that I just don&#39;t get from Manhattan.&nbsp; I lived in Manhattan 4 years, and it&#39;s nice and all, but I guess I felt a little isolated.&nbsp; I&#39;ve been in Astoria going on 9 years now, except for a short stint in Rego Park.&nbsp; I&#39;ve lived in a bunch of areas in Astoria and have traveled much of Queens by now.&nbsp; Overall, this feeling I get is everywhere.&nbsp; Yeah, there are sections of Elmhurst, Rego Park, and Jackson Hts I don&#39;t get this feeling from, but overall, I feel it&#39;s quite suburban here.&nbsp; And considering the amount of wasps, ants, squirrels, birds other than pigeons, racoons, possums, and other animals you can see around here, it&#39;s suburbia to me.&nbsp; People even hang their underwear out to dry on the clothesline here!&nbsp; And for the most part, driving around Queens doesn&#39;t look quite so harrowing.&nbsp; Also the holiday season here has a very small town feel as well.&nbsp; &nbsp;The music and decorations and all.&nbsp; Think opening scene in Gremlins.<br /><br />But I stress that these are only my impressions, opinions, and experiences, and not everyone is likely to share them.&nbsp; But hopefully, more than just me </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I think I agree with you, Meg. The single clearest aspect of Astoria that makes it &quot;urban&quot; and not &quot;suburban&quot; for me is that I can live here, quite happily, without a car. Farther out in Queens does seem to me to be significantly less dense, mid-20th century urbanism rather than late 19th-century urbanism, where cars really are necessary, however. But I wouldn&#39;t really call it suburban in the sense that the towns around Chicago are suburbs... <br />

				Astoria is not suburban. Any place that has direct access to the MTA Subway System couldn&#39;t possibly be anything but urban. I&#39;ve had stuck up Manhattan friends refuse to move to Queens because they consider it &quot;suburban.&quot; I grew up in Port Jeff Station in Suffolk County, that is Suburban. Though the reach of development has begun to get as far as there now too. The soccer fields and woods of my youth are now all condo developements. And places like Great Neck, LI feel almost urban with their similarly styled brick apartment complexes, MTA LI busses, sidewalks filled with pedestrians and choking traffic. Who knows, maybe one day all of LI will look like the island of Manhattan.<br /><br />what is this &quot;exurban&quot; term? something in between suburban and rural?

				I know I&#39;m a minority, but like I said, it&#39;s my opinion, experience, and impressions of Queens, not just Astoria. &nbsp;Astoria is just one bit of the entire picture of Queens and what I was thinking of. &nbsp;Queens is huge, and made up of many many neighborhoods. &nbsp;I grew up in a very extremely diverse area of upstate ny, only an hour and a half north of here. &nbsp;There are immigrants and many different colors there, and not very homogenous at all. &nbsp; I&#39;m not familiar with California or much of the rest of the USA as far as living there goes. &nbsp;I find that there are huge department stores here, - and in Beacon, where I&#39;m from, huge department stores are not that far away from where I lived either. &nbsp;So I don&#39;t see a zoning conflict, at least up there. &nbsp;In talking about Queens in general, there are tons of areas where having a car is absolutely necessary and at the very least helpful, and that would include many parts of Astoria. &nbsp;If I lived near the park, as many people do, I would love to have a car, as many people do. &nbsp; Anywhere near the water, and anywhere where the subway just does not reach. &nbsp;Having to rely on a bus would drive me crazy.<br /><br />Yes, perhaps as NYCMacuser said, there should be a term for something inbetween suburban and urban, because there are absolutely differences. &nbsp;Beacon has bigger yards for example. &nbsp;This of course is changing as people are selling their land just so more houses can be built. &nbsp;But for the most part, excluding the new McMansions, houses are the same size. &nbsp;Here they are more likely to rent out parts/floors of their houses, in Beacon - not so much. &nbsp; And yes, I love that I don&#39;t have to have a car here if I don&#39;t want to - but am also very happy to be near enough to the subway so that this is possible.<br /><br />I&#39;ve never heard of the term exurbia until now, and am not sure what it means. &nbsp;But I also don&#39;t consider where I&#39;m from - Beacon - rural. &nbsp;Therefore, it&#39;s suburban? &nbsp;Not sure, but never liked labels to begin with, and don&#39;t automatically think suburbia is so negative. &nbsp; And besides from the designated parks and planted trees in Manhattan I don&#39;t see much green there, not like here. &nbsp;Not sure what to call Queens, but whatever it is, it&#39;s not that urban to me.<br /><br />But either way, this is all subjective. &nbsp;We are all of different experiences growing up, different perspectives on life, and such. &nbsp; No biggie.

				Daisy - you&#39;re from Beacon?&nbsp; Jim and I were there last weekend!&nbsp; We loved it - in fact, we were discussing just what Beacon was - is it a suburb?&nbsp; Suburban?&nbsp; Does an area have to be a true suburb of a larger city to be suburban?&nbsp; We thought it was a little far to be a suburb, and settled on that it might be its own town or little city, with its own suburbs.&nbsp; But I don&#39;t know.<br /><br />I&#39;d never call Astoria suburban, though.&nbsp; It&#39;s a neighbourhood in New York City.&nbsp; I also consider the accessibility of the subway and the ability to live without a car - even though Astoria is more car friendly than, say, Manhattan - part of what makes it urban.&nbsp; Maybe it&#39;s a different urban than Manhattan, a different urban than Brooklyn (although not that much, really), but &quot;urban&quot; is not monolithic - in fact, it&#39;s defined partly by its very diversity.&nbsp; So to me, Astoria is nothing other than urban.

				<strong>From megc: &quot;I also associate suburbs with &quot;white flight&quot; and for suburbs to be ethnically/demographically homogenous, which I don&#39;t find Astoria to be.&quot;</strong><br /><br />I agree with just about everything you wrote, except that.&nbsp; This used to hold true, but certainly not in the last 10-20 years.&nbsp; You&#39;re finding plenty of black, hispanic and asian families clearing out for the suburbs.&nbsp; Wouldn&#39;t even say &quot;clearing out&quot; is the appropriate term -- in their minds, it&#39;s moving up, and in many cases financially, it is, and a victory of sorts.<br /><br />Like I&#39;ve noted in previous posts, I believe Astoria is on the slow-developing arc of gentrification.&nbsp; Rent and real estate wise, this started happening in earnest right around the turn of the century.&nbsp; One day soon, we&#39;re going to turn around and find studio apartments going for $1,200/month.&nbsp; In effect, you&#39;re getting a &quot;white flight&quot; to Astoria right now, albeit we&#39;re talking younger white people without families who cannot afford, or are slightly too sane, to afford Manhattan.<br /><br />One thing to keep an eye on is schoolyards, especially for elementary grades.&nbsp; Notice the racial demographics which, unless we&#39;re talking the specifically Greek schools, are predominately hispanic and black.&nbsp; Gentrification won&#39;t be a true reality here until you walk by a schoolyard and notice all the white kids, i.e., when people who moved here in the past 10 years feel comfortable enough to have and raise kids here, which hasn&#39;t happened yet.&nbsp; I have friends in Williamsburg encountering this now -- meaning they&#39;re from the suburbs, used to clean/nice schools, and shocked to death over how awful both the education their kids are receiving in public school, and how rundown/over-crowded the school is.&nbsp; That&#39;s the speed bump in gentrification!<br /><br />But I definitely agree with you on most of your points.&nbsp; I feel like I&#39;m living in the city when I&#39;m in Astoria, albeit a more quiet/much slower version than Manhattan.&nbsp; And I like it that way.

				I, too, grew up in the &#39;burbs of upstate NY.&nbsp; And I definitely don&#39;t look at Astoria as representing the suburbs at all.&nbsp; We have relatively reliable public transportation here.&nbsp; As was mentioned before, if there&#39;s decent public transit to get you to other parts of the city so a car is not a necessity, the suburbs it is not.&nbsp; Now NJ, particularly Bergen County, has the NJ Transit commuter trains.&nbsp; But these are not for just zipping around different parts of the county.&nbsp; They run on a tight schedule, and usually in hour increments.&nbsp; And other than using these trains to get to the urban center for work, a car is a necessity there.&nbsp; The fact that there are more houses than apartment buildings, I don&#39;t believe, disqualifies Astoria from being considered an urban area.&nbsp; The fact that there are so many stores, restaurants, etc. within walking distance, I think, designates Astoria as being an urban area.&nbsp; Keep things in context, also.&nbsp; Manhattan is the ultimate urban center in the entire country.&nbsp; Although Astoria is less of an urban environment compared to Manhattan, there is no denying that it is still an urban area relative to most other towns in the entire country.

				The exurbs are indeed beyond the suburbs.&nbsp; It has been said that Bush won the 2004 election with support from the exurbs and rural areas, which are all traditionally &quot;red.&quot;&nbsp; I recommend reading this artice from the NY Times:<br />http://tinyurl.com/held2<br /><br />&quot;McMansion&quot; is a term often used when discussing the exurbs.&nbsp; I also believe small towns and suburbs/exurbs are not the same.&nbsp; Exurbs also contain the planned community full of giant houses on land that is small in its ratio of land:house.<br /><br />I agree with those that say that the car is a defining element of whether a place is urban or suburban.&nbsp; It is almost impossible to live in the suburbs and have a manageable life without a car.<br /><br />I would agree the Beacon is a suburb.&nbsp; And remember, Queens is a borough made up of individual towns and cities.&nbsp; Brooklyn was conceived and developed as a single entity, a single city, with distinct neighborhoods.&nbsp; Manhattan the same way.&nbsp; <br /><br />Perhaps the beauty of Astoria is that you can find what you&#39;re looking for.&nbsp; daisy looks for suburban element and finds them.&nbsp; I look for urban elements/non-suburban elements and I find them.&nbsp; I will also say that I find Astoria has a lot to offer that a suburb could never off me in the way of transportation, culture, and sense of community.&nbsp; As daisy says, it&#39;s subjective.

				I&#39;m with daisy, from my own experience growing up in a suburb of Chicago (where we did have public transport, by the way), Astoria does seem a bit suburban to me, primarily because of the existence of the big box stores. &nbsp;It&#39;s also distinct from Manhattan, in my mind, which is more densely populated and is the definite urban center in this area. &nbsp;Maybe precisely because I grew up in a suburb, I find myself recreating the dynamic of where I live vs. the &quot;city.&quot;<br /><br />I wouldn&#39;t call Astoria a suburb necessarily, but it&#39;s somewhere in-between. &nbsp;Urban sprawl, perhaps?

				I&#39;m talking about the ones along Northern Blvd and in other places - Home Depot, Best Buy, Costco - in the Chicago area, these are concentrated in the suburbs.&nbsp; I was surprised to see stores like these in Manhattan.&nbsp; Maybe it has to do with the reliance of most New Yorkers on public transport - in Chicago, it&#39;s fairly common to own a car, even if you live within the city limits.

				&quot;Urban center&quot; and &quot;urban&quot; don&#39;t necessarily mean the same thing.<br /><br />I do not believe Astoria is a product of urban sprawl.&nbsp; That usually refers to the expanding of the suburbs and exurbs over a larger, horizontal area.&nbsp; However, Astoria is experiencing newfound density within its current limits with the newer developments that have been discussed here on the board, and therefore I believe discounts it as truly suburban.&nbsp; &quot;Urban Sprawl&quot; traditionally has negative connotations, as does &quot;suburbia&quot; (sorry, daisy).&nbsp;

				Looking for a new term for &quot;inbetween&quot; urban and suburban comes from a fundamental misunderstanding of the city as space, in my opinion. In this country, we tend to think of &quot;urban&quot; as densely packed with very little green space or private homes- in short, Manhattan. However, this is only one manifestation of the city.<br /><br />Really, to have an urban area, you need just two things: mixed-use and walkable. Manhattan is urban, but so is London, and they are very different cities. You can have a city of primarily private homes, as long as those homes are not separated from jobs and shopping by feeder roads requiring private cars.<br /><br />Suburban is simply a residential area that is physically separated from employment and shopping.<br /><br />In short, suburban and exurban living is primarily defined by an extreme separation of uses, which keeps getting worse. A 19th Century railroad suburb may have been a five-minute walk from the train station- now we have neighborhoods plopped down in a field 25 miles from the nearest employment or shopping.

				From wikipedia...<br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburbia<br /><br />Suburbs are inhabited districts located either inside a town or city&#39;s outer rim or just outside its official limits (the term varies from country to country), or the outer elements of a conurbation.<br /><br />The presence of certain elements (whose definition varies amongst urbanists, but usually refers to some basic services and to the territorial contiguity) identifies a suburb as a peripheral populated area with a certain autonomy, where the density of habitation is usually lower than in an inner city area, though state or municipal house building will often cause departures from that organic gradation. Suburbs have typically grown in areas with an abundance of flat land near a large urban zone, usually with minimal traditions of citizens clustering together for defence behind fortified city walls, and with transport systems that allow commuting into more densely populated areas with higher levels of commerce.

				Actually, the layout makes sense if understand that Astoria was part of Long Island City. Outside of some early planned communities (Old Astoria, Steinway) the area west of about 51st street was planned as a classic small city (very much like found in America&#39;s heartland) with zones for discrete types of activity:<br /><br />Hunters Point and Queens Plaza: transportation and commercial centers<br />Sunnyside and Astoria: residential precincts.<br />All connected by mass transportation with clearly identified neighborhood shopping/entertainment districts (Steinway Street, Queens Blvd.) <br /><br />Even better, the charms of Manhattan was only a few minutes away (even as early as the Civil War) so the area always had an urban edge to it. LIC/Astoria was very different from the rest of Queens, which, when all this was thought out, little more than cornfields. Its hard to believe, but some people from Bayside, for example, brag to this day that they have not been to the city for years.<br /><br />Even more significant, the merchants, property owners, and community leadership actually lived in the community, so everyting was planned to last. <br /><br />The problem now is this orderly set-up is breaking down: movie theaters are now placed so foot traffic goes through neighborhoods, skyscrapers are built without local shopping. Poor planning is now the order of the day.<br /><br />And the community leadership, merchants, and property owners increasingly do not live here. Their horizons are increasingly short term.<br /><br />Am looking forward to the planned mall over the Sunnyside Yards. You can kiss Steinway Street good-bye when that happens.

				It is interesting to read this thread and see how &quot;suburban&quot; is looked at in such a negative light. While I am not much for cookie-cutter houses and boxy stores, I tend to imagine suburbia comes in a wide range of shapes and colors, etc., etc. I&#39;d be fine living in a suburb myself.<br /><br />I actually consider Astoria to have more of a small-town feel to it rather than a suburb feel, but I can see how some of the outer sections of pretty much any of the boroughs would feel that way. I also don&#39;t think of Astoria as super urban either. Manhattan=super urban, Astoria=sort of urban.

				I lived my entire life up until a year ago in a neighborhood a lot like Astoria (on a smaller scale), and I can&#39;t imagine living anywhere less urban than a place like this. Like my dad (who has also spent his whole life in that &#39;hood) once said, &quot;I can&#39;t imagine not being able to get dinner at a decent restaurant, the newspaper from the corner store, and a drink from a local bar if my car was broken down.&quot; Basically, he likes being able to walk and get whatever he needs. Up until the local pharmacy closed, he used to go get his perscriptions too - he was big on supporting independently owned places even if it cost a little more because it seemed like the neighborly thing to do. I know there are always exceptions, but&nbsp; would there be a market for those types of places to flourish in suburban sprawl? If there is, I haven&#39;t seen much.<br /><br />I actually had an ex who lived in typical &quot;suburbia&quot;, and he refused to go to non-chain restaurants. Needless to say, that didn&#39;t last too long&nbsp; :roll:<br /><br />I think the bad ideas (for me, anyway) about typical suburbia partially come from the fact that people go from their house to their car to work, and then back home again at the end of the day. It seems like they don&#39;t really get to know their neighborhoods, or they don&#39;t take ownership of or responsibility for their neighborhoods. I have friends who live in really suburban areas (both on Long Island and in CT) who have no idea who their next door neighbors are, and I think that&#39;s so sad. I mean, I definitely don&#39;t know everyone who lives right around me, but if I see people in the hall or out front or whatever, I make an effort to say hi. These people I know just absolutely don&#39;t care to even pretend - its like they have their house on their land, and they don&#39;t owe anybody or the neighborhood anything.<br /><br />I guess it comes down to the fact that I feel that everyone in suburbia is so separated, where people in areas like this tend to be more of a community. But, like I said, this is just what I&#39;ve observed, I&#39;m SURE there are lots of people who could prove me wrong. :)<br /><br />Cookie cutter houses/McMansions also really depress me.

A few months ago I found an online community just as active as this one in a suburb in NJ (within commuting distance of NYC), and thought that was fantastic. They all talk about their favorite restaurants, stores, parks, etc., etc. just like we do - they just happen to be in the suburbs. They also seem to get together just as much as many &quot;Astorians.commers&quot; do.<br /><br />I do agree that it does take effort to get to know your neighbors in suburbia, but at the same time it is really great to have that extra bit of grass and not have your walls be shared with strangers (don&#39;t personally know my immediate neighbors). I also think it would be nice to have a car (not here, though). I sometimes get really tired of lugging everything around or pushing that granny cart.<br /><br />Of course I also think that it takes a lot of effort to get to know your neighbors in a place like Astoria as well. I lived here for a good year to two years before I knew another Astorian. Part of my problem is probably because I am not much into bar-hopping and *gasp* I happen to dislike most of the restaurants around here. So I suppose I am antisocial by nature. ;) At the same time I have read on Astorians more than once about other people who also have lived here for years without having friends or acquaintances in the neighborhood - that is, until they got on Astorians.com or started hanging out at a local cafe or bar.

Plus, it seems like there are more opportunities just to bump into/meet people in a place like Astoria. Like I said, I&#39;m just talking from my own (admittedly very limited) personal observations, and I know there are lots of exceptions. :)<br /><br />Speaking of development in other areas (mcw mentioned Chicago)...has anyone else flown into Las Vegas during the day? I know, ew, yes, Las Vegas, but its fun if you&#39;re in the right frame of mind. (People aren&#39;t even supposed to live in the desert like that! Arugh!) But, flying in, its seriously like, thousands of identical rooftops of houses. Then, more. Then, more and more and more. Then there are the main roads with the giant stores and strip malls. Its all just very shocking after flying over farmland and the Rocky Mountains! Also, I went there for the first time when I was 21 or 22, and my friends and I drove out to Red Rock Canyon one day. About 2 years later, we made the same trip (taking the same route), and the sprawl had spread SO MUCH from what I remembered, and on the outskirts, there was more construction. A friend once commented that she could see herself moving there (she is a cute blonde bartender, so she might be able to do well there), but I was like &quot;Why?!?!? Why would anyone ever want to live there??&quot;

				I have to chime in here about the knowing your neighbors thing. &nbsp;It&#39;s always been my impression from growing up upstate, and in the movies and tv, that everyone in a smaller city/town (Beacon is considered a city) knows each other. &nbsp;Growing up, the neighbors had block parties in which they invited everyone on the street, and they still do. &nbsp; My family knows most of everyone who lives on their block. &nbsp;You see a moving truck next door, you say hi.&nbsp; You walk over with baked goods.&nbsp; And in high school, I couldn&#39;t get away with anything, because word travels so quickly. &nbsp; &quot;I saw her with so and so and she was blah blah blah&quot; &nbsp;and so forth. &nbsp; In fact, when I left high school - I went away to the big city of Manhattan to college at NYU - and what did I love about it? &nbsp;The anominity and the fact that no one knew me, and had their own lives, and were too busy to worry about mine. &nbsp;I also liked the luxury of never having to see anyone I don&#39;t want to see ever again. &nbsp;And in Beacon, one of the primary refrains I hear about the city (Manhattan) is how no one knows each other. &nbsp;That said, something drew me to Queens. &nbsp;And maybe subconsciously, I want my neighbors to know me. &nbsp;Life is a big circle. &nbsp;But at least everyone has so much more to do here, so they don&#39;t have to make up stuff about my life, because their life is so uninteresting. &nbsp;Maybe that&#39;s the difference - things to do. &nbsp;There is so much more to do here than in Beacon. &nbsp;But you know, it&#39;s hard to meet people anywhere, and if it wasn&#39;t for Astorians - I would know very little people here.<br /><br />Oh and on my street in Beacon, a short walk away is a Dunkin Donuts, 2 bars, car dealerships, a dollar store, and a laudromat.&nbsp; And everyone drives to them.&nbsp; The stuff is a short walk, but yeah, most people drive.

				he could have been a hermit by choice or he could have silently suffered a solitude life. it&#39;s how people just gossip rather than take a genuine interest in people that sucks. and it&#39;s a matter of personality if you just know enough about a person to blab to someone else or if you get to know them, respect their privacy and then earn their respect enough so they may reach out and ask for help when they need it and no one else is around....<br /><br />as for urban vs. suburban vs. small town feel. in LA, yes LA, land of urban sprawl, my parents know their neighbors. why? because they have lived in the same house for 20 years and so have a good portion of other residents on our block. when it&#39;s a good place to live and real estate is out of control, you have no real cause to move. and guess what, maybe it&#39;s because in california people are less uptight or because we spend so much more time outdoors (and of course we have more time for it) but we have the block parties and the community events, and it&#39;s in one of the largest cities. even better, it gets so quiet at night, you can hear the coyotes, the crickets and sometimes even the mountain lions out on a hunt. go figure.<br /><br />i think astoria feels more small town or community for most americans in the same way it feels like i&#39;m&nbsp; back in the mediterranean region. people are out. shop owners are friendly. you can say hi to the people out on the stoop if you just dare go beyond the &quot;i don&#39;t talk to strangers&quot; attitude that marks most of manhattan. but then again, it&#39;s my job to say hi to strangers and enter their homes so maybe i&#39;m less afraid or held back by the thought of not wanting to intrude or overstep.

				I still think of suburbs as bedroom communities.&nbsp; I used to hear it a lot when I lived in the Santa Clarita Valley in SoCal, as Valencia was such a place.&nbsp; They also built a new development into the hills that was so massive it had its own brand spankin&#39; new zip code.&nbsp; Pretty amazing how the area looks now; I didn&#39;t even recognize the place when I was there last.

				My honest (un PC) feeling is that suburbia totally sucks. I was suburbia-born and raised. The real OC, on top of it all. As far as I can tell, suburban living is safe, clean, cheaper and part of the American Dream. But it can also be insular, narrow-minded, lacking in cultural activities, and frought with socioeconomic prejudice. On most subway lines, I see stockbrokers, lawyers, and other affluent suits riding alongside homeless winos, students, labor workers and Jesus freaks.&nbsp; Do you see all those people carpooling together in suburbia? The suburbanite lives most of his daily existence with blinders on, and those blinders are the buffer-zones of his lawn, his home equity, his cul-de-sac, and his home owners association. He doesn&#39;t have to deal with looking a panhandler in the eye on the way home from work. So why think about those unpleasant things? Just keep driving your Hummer to the Applebees and back...<br /><br />Sure, we were all safe and sheltered little suburban kids... but hanging out in the Chili&#39;s parking lot smoking and drinking because all the strip malls close at 7pm isn&#39;t exactly more culturally enriching than a night in the city. I mean, what if I grew up with independent film houses, cheap ehtnic food eateries, real libraries and concert halls? Maybe I wouldn&#39;t have been scarred by the goddamn &#39;bloomin onion&#39;.

				I couldn&#39;t agree with annie more.&nbsp; Suburbs to me represent static living.&nbsp; Many are dysfunctional.&nbsp; Most of them require a car to have a real, functional life.&nbsp; It IS possible to manage around the limitations, but it takes a lot of tolerance and willingness to adjust drastically.&nbsp; And in a region that has less than 4 season availability, even these adjustments don&#39;t work.&nbsp; Believe me, I did this - I lived on Long Island/Suffolk County without owning a car for 4 years.&nbsp; I was lucky enough to have some things within walking and biking distance, but not everything.&nbsp; And these places were not truly integrated into the community as is the case in NYC/Astoria.&nbsp; I was not able to function without some access to a car (bus system was a joke) during my entire time there.&nbsp; I&#39;m sorry, but you need a car in the suburbs.&nbsp; To me, this is dysfunction on many levels.

				I grew up in a fairly affluent suburb of Rochester, but my family was far from affluent.&nbsp; But I had a relatively possitive experience.&nbsp; Maybe it&#39;s because of my family, or friends, but I was exposed to many cultural activities and experiences.&nbsp; Certainly not as many as here, but I think I got a pretty good background of experiences to set me up for city living.&nbsp; I searched out and found some really amazing jazz musicians in Rochester.&nbsp; Ok, it was in the city proper, and not in the &#39;burbs.&nbsp; But downtown Rochester is just a stones throw from the burb I lived in.&nbsp; But my teachers were usually very encouraging, and gave me great advice on things I should check out.&nbsp; And the friends I associated with, most of whom I&#39;m still very close with, all seeked out great music and art to better themselves.<br /><br />So I think it has a lot to do with personal experiences that shape our oppinions of the burbs.&nbsp; And one last note...<br />I grew up playing soccer and lacrosse.&nbsp; Wouldn&#39;t have been possible in a city school.&nbsp; Being able to ride my bike to the school or park on a daily basis to play soccer or baseball was a great experience that I can&#39;t imagine living without.&nbsp; I wouldn&#39;t have been able to do that stuff in the city.<br /><br />So the city I would agree is about the best place I could be at this stage in my life.&nbsp; But growing up until the end of highschool, the burbs was just fine with me.&nbsp; And there are plenty of people in the city as well that have no desire to seek out the wonderful cultural benefits of the city.&nbsp; So again, it has just as much to do with the person as it does with the place.

				I agree with you completely.&nbsp; It&#39;s entirely dependent on your experiences growing up.&nbsp; Wherever you grow up.&nbsp; I have met many NYorkers born and raised who can&#39;t wait to leave this city.&nbsp; &nbsp;And as far as culture goes - look at Beacon now - I WISH I had access to that growing up.&nbsp; All those galleries and artists everywhere.&nbsp; It is 10 times more different than it was years ago.&nbsp; Art was a class in high school back then.&nbsp; I had many encouraging friends and teachers, and I wouldn&#39;t be where I am today without them.&nbsp; And with more people moving there from the city, I have noticed a lot more open-mindedness come into Beacon as well.&nbsp; I&#39;m not sure the gossiping will ever change though.&nbsp; Yeah, you need a car.&nbsp; Things close by 9pm.&nbsp; If you don&#39;t want to rely on a car and go out late night, you live in a place that has a transit system nearby and more of a nightlife.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#39;s pretty simple.&nbsp; Which is why I&#39;m in Astoria.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)&nbsp; But that said, one of the biggest reasons I am happy I grew up elsewhere is that I know how to drive.&nbsp; And it&#39;s all a part of what has led me to the person I am today.<br /><br />As far as what constitutes suburb and city at this point, I could care less.&nbsp; &nbsp;The big box stores tend to remind me of upstate, so that&#39;s my biggest comparison.&nbsp; I&#39;m just happy to live in a place I love, and that fulfills my needs at this point in my life.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=3000.msg25937.html#msg25937">Quote from: Jtrane on August 18, 2006, 12:15:24 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I grew up in a fairly affluent suburb of Rochester, but my family was far from affluent.&nbsp; But I had a relatively possitive experience.&nbsp; Maybe it&#39;s because of my family, or friends, but I was exposed to many cultural activities and experiences.&nbsp; Certainly not as many as here, but I think I got a pretty good background of experiences to set me up for city living.&nbsp; I searched out and found some really amazing jazz musicians in Rochester.&nbsp; Ok, it was in the city proper, and not in the &#39;burbs.&nbsp; But downtown Rochester is just a stones throw from the burb I lived in.&nbsp; But my teachers were usually very encouraging, and gave me great advice on things I should check out.&nbsp; And the friends I associated with, most of whom I&#39;m still very close with, all seeked out great music and art to better themselves.<br /><br />So I think it has a lot to do with personal experiences that shape our oppinions of the burbs.&nbsp; And one last note...<br />I grew up playing soccer and lacrosse.&nbsp; Wouldn&#39;t have been possible in a city school.&nbsp; Being able to ride my bike to the school or park on a daily basis to play soccer or baseball was a great experience that I can&#39;t imagine living without.&nbsp; I wouldn&#39;t have been able to do that stuff in the city.<br /><br />So the city I would agree is about the best place I could be at this stage in my life.&nbsp; But growing up until the end of highschool, the burbs was just fine with me.&nbsp; And there are plenty of people in the city as well that have no desire to seek out the wonderful cultural benefits of the city.&nbsp; So again, it has just as much to do with the person as it does with the place.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
