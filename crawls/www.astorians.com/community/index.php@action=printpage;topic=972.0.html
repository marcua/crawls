				Astorian Sandwich Eaters,<br /><br />I am posing a sandwich dilema to you, seeking your sandwich wisdom:<br /><br />I want to make a sandwich for lunch. <em>At work</em>. I want to keep the sandwich makings there and just make it there. I'm vegetarian. I work in an office that has a kitchen...ya know, a fridge, microwave, counter, sink, cabinets. Recommendations?

				1. &nbsp;peanut butter and jelly<br />2. &nbsp;cheese and pickle (get branston's at tea and sympathy)<br />3. &nbsp;cream cheese, nuts and dried fruit<br /><br />i was thinking about this earlier and that's all could come up with. &nbsp;maybe there will be some answers for me too...

				Hey &nbsp;- <br /><br />I'm PB&amp;J'ed out. But thanks. <br /><br />I think there is a cheese sandwich in my future, but I'm not sure about the cheese and a pickle. Although I like both quite a lot.

				not &quot;a&quot; pickle.<br /><br />Branston's pickle. &nbsp;It's this british thing, sort of like a root vegetable chutney, crunchy and spicy, AWESOME with cheese.<br /><br />you get it at Tea and Sympathy on Greenwich St. (not ave)

				Keep a bag of pitas in the fridge, along with a container of hummus and a container of baba ganoush (like Sabra or whatever brand you like). &nbsp;A container of prepared fresh veggies of your choice - lettuce, tomato, carrots, cucumber, peppers, lightly cooked broccoli or cauliflower, whatever, even avocados. &nbsp;A container with sliced cheese if you want. &nbsp;A bottle of Tabasco on your desk. &nbsp;That gives you a base for variety every day.<br /><br />If you want it hot you can nuke some of the veggies with a slice of cheese over them on a plate. &nbsp;Wrap the pita up in a paper towel and nuke it for about 20 seconds to take off the chill. &nbsp;Slide the warmed veggies with melted cheese into the pita.<br /><br />In addition to the boca burgers Flooz mentions, I also like Quorn patties. &nbsp;You heat them on paper towels, so they don't have an excessive amount of liquid.

				Depending on how cleanly you can eat, you could make TVP sloppy joes - just keep dry TVP and a jar of tomato sauce on hand.<br /><br />Also, some grocery stores sell packaged marinated tofu steaks - you don't need to cook them, just drain, pat dry, and shove between slices of bread.<br /><br />Other options: canned refried beans; olive spread; cream cheese &amp; cucumber; veggie pâté; etc.<br /><br />And if you rotate the types of bread, too, then the possibilities are endless! :-)

				oh, two more ideas:<br /><br />i used to replicate the whole foods eggplant salad. &nbsp;at this point i don't remember exactly how i did it. &nbsp;roasted eggplant and tomatoes were involved, plus chickpeas, parsley and feta. &nbsp;mix it all up and put it in pita.<br /><br />i have also kept a salad in the fridge with a sandwich spread, cheese, canned jalepenos and olives and made a spicy vegetarian sandwich that way.

				Hey all (and particularly ASS) - <br />I started a little blog chronicling veggie sandwiches, perhaps inspired by enigmacat and maura and my search for lunch. I know there's sandwich fanatics and vegetarians on this board. This could definitely be a team blog. If others are interested, let me know. It’s veggiesandwich.blogspot.com. I know it's kind of silly, but it could be fun.<br />-Cheese
