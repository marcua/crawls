				I was reading the thread about the dog run and I really miss my Cocker Spaniel &quot;Patches&quot;.&nbsp; I had to put her to sleep last May and I still miss her terribly.&nbsp; She was diabetic for four years and needed two shots of insulin a day.&nbsp; Her vision failed and she was 100% blind the last year or two but was sweet and gentle to the end.&nbsp; If anyone else has lost a pet when do you feel like getting another one or do you just not want to go through the loss again?

There are meadows and hills for all of our special friends so they can run and play together. There is plenty of food, water and sunshine, and our friends are warm and comfortable.<br />&nbsp;<br />All the animals who had been ill and old are restored to health and vigor. Those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again, just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by. The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing; they each miss someone very special to them, who had to be left behind. <br />They all run and play together, but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance. His bright eyes are intent. His eager body quivers. Suddenly he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster and faster. <br /><br />You have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again. The happy kisses rain upon your face; your hands again caress the beloved head, and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart. <br /><br />Then you cross Rainbow Bridge together....&nbsp; <br /><br />Author unknown...<br />&nbsp;<br />

				We lost our cat suddenly in November of 07 and I was really hesitant to jump into having pets again.&nbsp; That said, however, we decided that the universe would let us know when it was time to adopt as that is how we knew when it was the right time to adopt our previous cat.&nbsp; Lucky for us the universe has plans for us and we adopted a brother and sister that had been taken away from a woman who &quot;horded&quot; and lived in the shelter/foster systems for months before they came to live with us.&nbsp; The love these two share for one another is quite powerful as they have been through so much and are happy to have a stable home.<br /><br />I guess my best advice is to just throw it out there and you will know when the time is right.

				Oh, the Rainbow Bridge poem gets me EVERY TIME. Seriously, I can&#039;t hear the words &quot;Rainbow Bridge&quot; without choking up. <br /><br />One of my kitties will be 17 years old in May. He&#039;s still plugging away, but there are days I wonder how long he&#039;s got. No major problems yet except for a few days here and there where he can&#039;t keep food down, but I am dreading the day I put him in the car for the last time (he LOVES car rides) and come home to my other little guy without his big bro. Having had to put another cat down several years ago when she was 21 years old, I definitely know that losing a pet is like losing a member of the family. There&#039;s always a special place in your heart just for your little buddy.&nbsp; :cry:

				I&#039;m sorry for your loss. I know just how you feel!<br /><br />I just put my dog down in September. He had lymphatic cancer and was suffering a great deal.<br />My vet was wonderful - he and his staff were just great and helped me accept the fact that at <br />14, he&#039;d had a really good, long life. <br /><br />But it was SO hard. Although he was my third dog, my dad had always &quot;done the deed.&quot; <br />Luckily my boyfriend was right there next to me. He held my hand while his other petted<br />my boy&#039;s head and told him how great he was. <br /><br />It&#039;s been a few months now and while I miss him terribly, I&#039;m not sure about owning another<br />one. I don&#039;t know if I have the strength for that again. A friend of mine told me to wait two<br />years to fully get him out of my system so that whether I decide to get another animal or not,<br />I make the decision with a clear head. And I think he&#039;s right. <br /><br />But let yourself grieve. Don&#039;t deny the feelings. Thank god people at my job too were wonderful.<br />A couple of women here brought me flowers (!)&nbsp; and others gave me cards. Sounds silly to some,<br />but it was devastating and having that support and show of understanding was helpful. <br /><br />My dogs pix are still on my desk and even if I get another one, I wouldn&#039;t put them away. <br />They&#039;re a part of you - good and bad - and the loss is very painful.<br /><br />Wait awhile and see how you feel. <br /><br />Good luck.

				You&#039;ll know when it&#039;s the right time to get another pet... with the exception of my first two cats (Squeaky, who has since gone over the Rainbow Bridge, and Velcro, who is still with us), our other pets have always found us. Our dog was found outside of an abandoned house near work as a stray puppy. After a few weeks of going from co-worker to co-worker, she finally settled in with us. And our other cat was found mangy and scrawny, right outside of our building during a torrential downpour (as if he thought, &quot;it&#039;s raining and I&#039;m hungry, and I think there are might be some cat-loving lesbians around here to take me in and pamper me... &quot; Smart kitty!).<br /><br />While you may not have the animal finding luck (?) that I do (I also found a chicken once, but brought her to an animal sanctuary upstate), you&#039;ll know when it&#039;s the right time to move on. Much like love, it comes when you least expect it and when you&#039;re not looking.

				I am so, so sorry for your loss.&nbsp; I had to put down my 15 year old dog a few years ago...he had been through so much with me and I was devastated.&nbsp; Shortly after he passed, I began volunteering with dogs and cats at the ASPCA.&nbsp; Dudley was a rescue, and I thought it might help to refocus some of my grief into helping other animals.&nbsp; It defintely helped a little.&nbsp; I still have not gotten another dog, but I did rescue 2 wonderful cats who think they are dogs!&nbsp; They are both so snuggly I think they are channeling Dudley&#039;s spirit&nbsp; :wink:<br />

My mom never thought she&#039;d get over the death of her first cat, but she ended up loving our second cat just as much, even though she was nothing like the other cat. All animals are different and have their own personalities and something to offer. It&#039;s like making a new friend, if it helps to think of it that way. You won&#039;t get over the death of your pet, but I think it&#039;s worth the good years you have with them to get another one when you feel ready to welcome one into your life.

				I&#039;m sorry to hear about your doggie. I&#039;ve had dogs and cats in my life since I was five and have had to say goodbye to quite a few. The very worst experience was having my 4-year old cat die suddenly in the middle of the night while she was sleeping next to me. The veterinarian said it was probably an aneurysm of some sort and there was nothing that I could have done to prevent it, but I still obsessed about her behavior in the previous month, searching for clues. In my grief, I adopted a kitten almost 2 months later thinking it would make me feel better. In hindsight, that was not a good idea. We never really bonded, though she got very attached to my then-boyfriend.<br /><br />In the end it worked out: the 2nd cat stayed with my ex-boyfriend when we broke up, and now I have a very sweet pair of cats, brother and sister, living with me. They came along at just the right time and I am so glad I took them in. You will know when the time is right, when the right dog licks your hand and gives you the &quot;take me home with you&quot; look.<br /><br />-Deborah
