				Hello All,<br />I am looking to start a band with musicians in the Astoria area. My friend plays bass and I play guitar and sing lead and backup vocals. His favorite band is Rage against the Machine and mine is Led Zeppelin, so we play pretty much anything between. Working with Astoria musicians would be great because we have the Great Astoria Sound Rehearsel studios which are very affordable.<br /><br />I am looking for somone who is in their twenties and had been playing for several years. My friend has been playing for 13 years and I have been playing for 14 so we need a solid musician.<br /><br />I look forward to hearing from you.<br /><br />Take Care,<br />C

				Do you and your band practice in that studio on Broadway, between Crescent and 29th?&nbsp; &nbsp;I know a good drummer, but he&#039;s already&nbsp; in a band, I willl ask him though, maybe he knows someone.

				Thanks, that would be cool. We are serious about this so if he is invovled with another band I prefer not wasting my time. However if he wants to jam with us, I am down with that.<br /><br />We would rehearse at Astoria Soundworks on 23rd ave. near steinway.<br /><br />Take Care
