				At the request of a friend I've decided to start a new topic not so much about politics in general but rather about the intrinsic nature of Power itself.<br />Such meanderings and musings, speculations and theories can conveniently be categorized under the topic of Political Philosophy. For those of you who are new to the idea, much can be gleaned from one of the recommended books for university students called <span class="bbc_u">Political Thinking: The Perennial Questions</span>, by Glenn Tinder.<br /><br />Or, for those of you who mind paying 40 or so dollars for a 264 page paperback book, <span class="bbc_u">The Prince</span>, by Nicolò Machiavelli will serve just as well. Since it is in the public domain you can view it here without threat of being sued for copyright infringement:<br />http://www.constitution.org/mac/prince00.htm<br /><br />I'm sure there are better versions available online or you can pay a little over 4USD for a paperback version at your nearest book-chain-outlet.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Here is the history of the birth of the thread (if anyone is interested):<br /><br />Albert: I think that rhetoric is always hard to avoid and it brings to mind the &quot;anxiety of influence&quot; that poets sometimes feel. I feel it's hard to be original in one's views especially when certain problems seems to have &quot;obvious&quot; causes and/or solutions.<br /><br />Bert: I guess that goes back to my earlier comment of at least being willing to have your beliefs challenged. Unfortunately, the stink of politics tends to hinder that. Politics don't allow us to think, just react and endorse. Nasssty business, really.<br /><br />Albert: Also, maybe you are a little too dismissive concerning the field of politics; here I'm going to attempt to sway you Smile. And I have to admit that this subject makes me slightly nauseous as well. Outside of partisanship and reoccurring rhetoric however, there is a branch of thought called &quot;Political Philosophy&quot; which seeks to understand the dynamics and mysteries of power. It asks such perennial questions such as &quot;Does might equal right?&quot;, &quot;Should the masses decide policy&quot;, or &quot;Are we better governed by a professional class of educated individuals? IOW an elite&quot;.<br />I believe that the ideas we hold toward the concept of power and how it should be distributed or defined affects us every day of our lives (not just on the macroscopic level) from how we line up for the bus or that early morning cup of coffee, how close we allow others to get to us spatially, to how we allocate our listening space to our friends. In fact, the egalitarian anarchistic ideals that I personally strive for is a direct result of the preconceptions I hold regarding politics. `Power' is one among many glasses that reality can be filtered by. Pecking-orders, hierarchies and flowcharts are ubiquitous (even if not clearly defined) and I believe that these relationships need to be explored if we are ever to rise above the realm of strictly automatic (animalistic) responses to situations.<br /><br />Bert: I [would] really [like] exploring issues of power and authority. Let's take what you wrote here and turn it into another topic! Sound good?<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I thought it sounded good and so here is the topic. Let me reiterate a long held belief of mine:<br />&quot;In addition to being sexual beings, we are spiritual beings; we are also <em>political</em> beings. These aspects of our nature (human nature) will only be denied at great peril to our happiness and well-being.&quot; Not very original, I admit, but sometimes overlooked.<br /><br />Some food for thought or the beginning of a &quot;perennial&quot; discussion:<br />&quot;Power tends to corrupt; absolute power corrupts absolutely&quot;--Lord Acton<br /><br />Salve,<br />-zeno-

				I'm going to try to resist sounding too academic, but I won't skimp on the cynicism... :twisted:<br /><br />Politics is about goal attainment within a social sphere. Accordingly, it also provides a medium by which we define/refine those goals. And not just on a governmental level. For instance, when your book club is deciding what to read next, getting everyone to choose involves politics.<br /><br />But when we talk about Politics as we know it whereby it's become a <em>profession</em> rather than an act of service, it's more about self-serving the practitioners. IOW, the goal is to preserve their power, expand it, take it away from rivals, etc. A politician may say, &quot;the goal is to [insert issue],&quot; but really it's, &quot;the goal is to make sure I stay in office.&quot;<br /><br />(When I say 'office', I don't just mean elected officials. It could apply to all sorts of positions of authority, from school principals to CEOs.)<br /><br />It gets really messy when politicos start colluding. Then you get political parties, platforms and agendas that creates a power system for its own sake. Self-invested authority will seek to expand that authority -- at the very least preserve it.

				Title: <strong>Power as an end in itself</strong><br />
				Post by: <strong>zeno</strong> on <strong>September 16, 2005, 01:29:18 PM</strong>
			</dt>
			<dd class="postbody">
				I must admit Daveed that your last post has me positively salivating :twisted: <br /><br />I recently finished a video game (Deus Ex 2: Invisible War) which your post brought to mind. http://www.deusex.com/<br /><br />Within the game there are two rival organizations (fictional), namely the WTO which represented economic and structural reform (big business) and The Order (a green religious group). Denizens of this fantasy world belonged to one or the other (for the most part). Ideologically and practically they were diametrically opposed, both in their rhetoric and actions. I'm sorry if I spoil the ending for anyone who hasn't played it yet, but about 3/4 through the game it is dicovered that both organizations were in fact inventions of One group... namely the global Illuminati. The main protagonist expresses shock at this somewhat predictable state of affairs and when he/she questions the reasoning behind this grand deception he/she is answered something to the effect that &quot;The Illuminati cares for nothing except for the Centralization of Power and will use any platform regardless of programme to that end. Inventing two organizations that are in conflict with one another simply served as a necessary step toward galvanizing the disparate populace into one of the two groups thereby eventually making an ultimate synthesis possible.&quot;<br />I'm not sure how this relates to the current world (if at all) but I thought it was interesting.<br /><br />I admire the simplicity and elegance with which you formularize the motivation which lies behind the political profession: <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;A politician may say, &quot;the goal is to [insert issue],&quot; but really it's, &quot;the goal is to make sure I stay in office.&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />However, and now we reach a conundrum, could it be said that a politician may also add to this and come out with the following: &nbsp;&quot;A politician may say, &quot;the goal is to [insert issue],&quot; but really it's, &quot;the goal is to make sure I stay in office&quot;, &quot;so I can be in a position to help with &nbsp;[insert the same or &nbsp;another issue].&quot;<br /><br />When people strive to obtain, preserve or expand their power, original motivations may be unclear. I believe that a certain percentage will use their position for completely selfish ends, another percentage for competely altruistic goals, and I believe that the greatest percentage will be an admixture of the two.<br /><br />Mixing analogies let's liken this argument to the pursuit of wealth. Some will pursue money to live comfortably (a means to an end), others will pursue monetary gain so that they may provide for others (not at all uncommon these days), and some others will pursue money simply because they like the smell of crisp dollar bills and the retention of these bills will potentially expand their ability to exponentially expand the horizons of their fetish.<br /><br />Am liking this conversation :-),<br />zeno<br /><br />P.S.: I have a question to put forth to the group (the group that surfs the net and reads posts). <br />Is it desired or even necessary to have professional politicians?

				Power is about control. We, in our benevolent society, presume that it is about [insert issues]. Or it is about the longevity of staying in office, (what 8yrs?). But really political power is quite limited in our society. We have distributed it broadly, made possible attainments seem minor, and regimented the requirements and procedure so that there is little satisfaction out of winning an office. There are however other types of power, like business and propaganda. Here America has made much wider gains in control. By having a powerful business machine we can control most of the worlds resources. Through the long arm of our propaganda machine we have a powerful impact over the worlds mind. It is of course changing as other countries are beginning to discover the limit of power that we are willing to exorcise. In order to understand the true nature of power you have to look at it both on its largest scale by viewing global politics both in terms of how countries interact with each other, but also by how they act with their own constitutes. But you really also have to look at politics on a micro scale...say a family and the power dynamics of siblings. &nbsp;The principles of power remain the same where ever you find the need to struggle for control over something. Here you can isolate through the various scenarios that it all has to do with control. If you want peace you have to have a mechanism that distributes power across a broad platform. Honestly that only insures, of course, minimal damage control by the warring parties<br /><br />I think an interesting topic to explore would be the cyclical nature of power and its attainment. And how many people are seeking power for those reasons?

				This definition came from a former professor of mine who had consultantship ties to various figures in government. His role was to provide dispassionate advice concerning the use, retention and proper execution of power for those who didn't have the time to fully explore these issues. [Italics mine]<br /><br />&quot;Power (in the social sphere) is the measurement of the ability to get people to do what you want them to do willy nilly, that is, <em>whether they want to or not</em>.&quot; -L.<br /><br />There are many parallels between money and power, though I think that it would be erroneous to equate the two. Both follow silmiliar principals of economy and both have directly proportionate (at times) relationships to each other. There are many exceptions to this rule, so to say that money=power, or speed=power would be missing the point. The only equation that makes sense to me is power=power, which isn't very helpful. To what end these (precious?) resources are directed toward is a separate matter entirely, but at the same time one of the only instruments with which we can gage it's influence.<br /><br />&quot;It's always good to question authority wherever possible.&quot; -Emmanuel Goldstein<br /><br />zero.

				&quot;Power that is given or bestowed is not power at all, but rather the semblance or mimicry of power. Just as Sun shines on Moon, Earth admires reflected glory.&quot; -Ancient Chinese Proverb<br /><br />&quot;The temple, he says, took fire and was burnt while its mistress was absent, assisting at the birth of Alexander. And all the Eastern soothsayers who happened to be then at Ephesus, looking upon the ruin of this temple to be the forerunner of some other calamity, ran about the town, beating their faces, and crying that this day had brought forth something that would prove fatal and destructive to all Asia....&quot;<br /><br />(http://www.coinimages.co.uk/images/1994greece5ecualexanderthegreatobv240.JPG)<br /><br />Bucephalus<br /><br />&quot;...still keeping the reins in his hands, and stroking him gently when he found him begin to grow eager and fiery, he let fall his upper garment softly, and with one nimble leap securely mounted him, and when he was seated, by little and little drew in the bridle, and curbed him without either striking or spurring him. Presently, when he found him free from all rebelliousness, and only impatient for the course, he let him go at full speed, inciting him now with a commanding voice, and urging him also with his heel. Philip and his friends looked on at first in silence and anxiety for the result, till seeing him turn at the end of his career, and come back rejoicing and triumphing for what he had performed, they all burst out into acclamations of applause; and his father shedding tears, it is said, for joy, kissed him as he came down from his horse, and in his transport said, &quot;O my son, look thee out a kingdom equal to and worthy of thyself, for Macedonia is too little for thee.&quot;&quot;-Plutarch<br /><br /><br />&quot;Speak softly and carry a big stick; you will go far.&quot;-Theodore Roosevelt<br /><br />&quot;Submission and peace will only carry us far.&quot;-Cato the Elder (Apoc.)<br /><br />Sleep tight Astorians,<br />Zeno.

				Title: <strong>Of water, gourds, pyramids and Divine Right</strong><br />
				Post by: <strong>zeno</strong> on <strong>October 29, 2005, 08:10:09 AM</strong>
			</dt>
			<dd class="postbody">
				After reconnecting with my subconscious mind, a.k.a. sleep, I remembered that there is another way to look at power, or another way to model it, and this model to me (although metaphoric) seems to me to make the most sense.<br /><br />Imagine if you will... water. Water is the life giver and yet it is also known as the Universal Solvent. Now, imagine if you will a network of gourds and these gourds are filled with water with one gourd that is tipping over filling the next and the second gourd filling the third and so on. Maybe the sixth gourd is not only filling the seventh gourd but also the eighth as well. As the water flows into the gourds imagine that the water picks up speed as it makes its way down, the higher the first gourd the more crushing its effect on the last. The more gourds there are then the bigger the reservoir the first must be.<br /><br />If the first gourd were to steady itself or to dry up then the consecutive gourds would by logical extention also dry up. If the first gourd in the series were to limit the flow of water by only slightly steadying itself then the remaining gourds would adjust themselves accordingly becoming either more filled or less filled with water. What would happen if the first gourd were cracked? Depending on where the fracture was (and how severe) we could have the first gourd spilling more water into the third gourd while completely bypassing the second!<br /><br />If power can be likened to water, then power flows down. That is its natural state. And this works itself in well with the pyramidal model of power, where you have one extremely paranoid individual (capstone) at the top and a multiplicity of bricks at the bottom supporting it. Why paranoid? Oh, let me explain.<br /><br />Apexualis is a man who is afraid of his own shadow so he hires a bodyguard. Can this bodyguard be trusted? In all good conscience Apexualis hires another bodyguard to watch the first. But who will watch the second? Why, a third bodyguard of course! And the third...? Well, there is definitely something shady about him...<br />This goes on until the amount of potential bodyguards runs out or the resources of the first to control them. Keep also in mind that the bodyguards themselves have become the apex of their own pyramids and also need watching. :-) The higher the pyramid, the greater the resources, id est the greater the power. So now you have this gargantuan structure with everybody watching everybody else but more importantly everyone is watching the one individual at the top from whom they take their cue. If it was Apexualis' original intent to feel more secure then it seems to me that he has alot more to worry about now besides his own shadow.<br /><br />Back to the gourds. There is another use for this model of aqueducts and reservoirs which has been used historically. This self-same system has also been used to model the flow of divine energy or spiritual enlightenment, even Grace. As the water flowed from one gourd to the next the water got more tainted as a result. The water which supplied the first gourd came from resplendent Heaven and had complete purity. By some twist of word association and post nocturnal grogginess this brings me to the Divine Right of Kings.<br /><br />Is it a coincidence that there has always been throughout history a dialectic between Church and State, Hierophant and Pharoah, Pope and King? Who gave Charlemagne his crown and who crowned Napolean? Who does George W. talk to anyway when he appears to be muttering to himself when he should be studying with his speechalist? And why was it so fashionable in Egypt and Rome for the supreme rulers to deify themselves? Didn't they have enough power? Perhaps this was only a justification for the power that they already wielded. After all people are less likely to question the dictum of a god than a mere mortal. And why do people seek power to begin with? Could it be that the closer to the top of the pyramid one gets the more likely one would be able to comprehend the inner workings of the Universe, the truer meanings of existence, and a more personal relationship with God to boot? To mortal-ken that have a limited time on earth, that are in fact Doomed to Die, perhaps it wasn't a &quot;relationship&quot; to God that was sought for after all, and given the imperious nature of these individuals who never liked playing second fiddle to anyone, perhaps it was Eternity...<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;So Alexander went to visit Diogenes at his home and found him lying down, sun-bathing. &nbsp;Diogenes raised himself up a little when he heard the crowd approaching, and Alexander asked the philosopher very courteously if there was any favor a king could do for him. &nbsp;Diogenes only said: &quot;Yes, please take your shadow off me.&quot; &nbsp;Alexander's companions, on the way back, were making fun of the simple-minded old man, but Alexander told them: &quot;Laugh if you must, but if I were not Alexander I would choose to be Diogenes.&quot;-from Plutarch's &quot;Lives&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />----Zeno

				I can’t say that I really agree with the way your analogy of water reflects the nature of power. To me that analogy was indicative to the nature of gravity. In the past I believe that people thought power was pyramid in nature, and that analogy would have worked then. But we know that is not true now. It is actually more akin to frequency vibrations that anything else. So in that sense we could create a new analogy that in which we compare the way that sound travels through water. Some frequencies are able to travel through water more easily than others. By the nature of the frequency, you can conclude the power of the sonic wave. So then by going back to your view of the bodyguards you demonstrate that a true pyramid distribution of power is not an effective method of transferring power. How many guards can the guy buy before he runs out of money, and through the whole process he still has to live with the fear of his shadow? A more modern way of looking at the issue would be to hire one guard who is not afraid of shadows to demonstrate to the guy that he does not have to be afraid. Since most of us know that a shadow, by itself will not hurt anyone. Here the nature of power stills lies in the nature of control, but it is a change in what is being controlled. Rather than a person we are controlling it is a fear.<br /><br />On your last issue you tie power with spirituality. To explore this you have to go back and analyze the root of how God entered into human understanding. &nbsp;Without going into the definition of God, Which would be the seed, we can conclude that Man has looked to God as the authority in the universe and as such we have subscribed to God the beacon of morality. In part, because over time we recognize our own failings, but also because we have not been able to understand all that transpires in the world or why. &nbsp;God becomes the convenient escape goat for our failings, and simultaneously the hope by which we imagine we will overcome them. It becomes an intellectual case of denial, followed by a willingness to try to get better. It also embarks upon the beginning of change in the way we look at power. If there is no clear line of communication between the creator and the created, there can be an array of miscalculated conclusions and as such the otherwise given distribution of power could be tampered. We then gain a surer platform by which to attempt to acquire power over our own lives. This leads to the notion that failure is a vital part of our growth, and creates a lesser dependency on God to solve our problems. Eventually you can logically move towards the conclusion that we must develop a moral standard independent of God. Today this is probably the hottest issue regarding the distribution of power. <br /><br />From here you can move quite easily into the region of Religion, which I will skip. Structured religions are a thing of the past, at least intellectually. They will, like race, be used as a means of acquiring and maintaining power for years to come, until such time as the whole of man recognizes their fallacies. Having said that, the moral vacuum that comes from such a fallout could be devastating. &nbsp;To move forward into the future of understanding and implementing moral codes without the notion of a God, we get easily lost into the mathematical impossibilities of understanding all the circumstances of a scenario and have to conclude eventually that the best we can do when it comes to making the right decision morally is make a good guess. And then through our weakness we permit ourselves to make that guess work in our advantage, undermining our integrity. <br /><br />To those who argue that we all know right from wrong, I would strongly disagree. Instinct can prompt us to do any number of things that would be considered abhorrent morally. So if it is not instinct and it is not God, what is it that allows us to make decisions of moral right and wrong? Obviously, those who are in power make the moral codes by which we adhere to as a society. &nbsp;The strongest debate lies in the priority of the moral power. Does the individual have a right to create his own moral edicts? Does society have the right to independently create their own? &nbsp;And when there is a conflict which one has the moral high ground? <br /><br />From here it would be unwise to pass a decision and say that one or the other is more important. &nbsp;The issue wraps itself around the priority an individual will have in shaping society, and vice versa. Ultimately, there has to be a sharing of power and control. &nbsp;Where that lies would have to be at the frequency where the needs of society and individuals resonate.
