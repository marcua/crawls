				Worldly travelers and foodies, any advice as to the &quot;not to miss&quot; restaurants in Montreal? We&#039;ll be taking a 6 day trip and I&#039;ve heard you can&#039;t have a bad meal in this city, but are there any standouts you&#039;ve experienced?

				The food is great at mant places but the best restaurant we went to was Stash, which isn&#039;t gourmet -- polish homecooking, more like-- but we never, ever wanted to leave. it was just a great place to hang out in.

				Six days?&nbsp; I&#039;m envious!&nbsp; I love Montreal, and the food and restaurants are fantastic.<br /><br />First on anyone&#039;s list should be Au Pied de Cochon (http://www.restaurantaupieddecochon.ca/index_eng.html), specifically their poutine topped with foie gras.&nbsp; It&#039;s a heart attack on a plate but entirely worth it.&nbsp; They have a whole section on their menu devoted to foie gras, in addition to many local/Quebecois specialties, including lots of game.&nbsp; The venison tartare is also delicious.<br /><br />Another restaurant we enjoyed very much but that seems to be off the tourist radar is Aux Deux Canailles (http://www.hour.ca/food/food.aspx?iIDArticle=766).&nbsp; Reasonable and delicious (but we didn&#039;t try the horse tartare).<br /><br />Aux Deux Canailles<br />256 Roy E., 844-0222<br />Dinner for two, not including wine, tax or tip: $40-$60 (prices from 2004)<br />Lunch tables d&#039;hôte, Mon. to Fri.: $13-$17<br /><br />(I found one online reference that indicates that Aux Deux Canailles closed in that location and may now be a Basque restaurant called Pintxo.&nbsp; It was supposed to have reopened somewhere else - I have found it in current online lists at 250 Roy E., with the same phone number.)<br /><br />Regardless, though, almost anywhere you go it will be good.&nbsp; Enjoy!

				For Montreal meals there are two things you definetly need to have.&nbsp; Poutine and smoked meat.<br />Poutine, I would suggest La Banquise which is on Rue Rachel right off of Parc Lafontaine.&nbsp; Good news is is that place is 24 hours, the last call rush is always amusing.&nbsp; And for Smoked meat, Schwartz&#039;s on St. Laurent cannot be beat, there is usually a line on the weekends but definetly worth the wait.&nbsp;
