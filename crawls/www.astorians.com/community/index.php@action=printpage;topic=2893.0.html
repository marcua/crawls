				The one nice thing is that they do have an office where you can call and have your complaints/problems/issues heard regarding their rental units.&nbsp; I lived in one of his blgs.&nbsp; Some people I contacted at the office were very nice, others were not so nice.&nbsp; It helps to be very informed of your rights as a tenant when calling, and written letters help as well.&nbsp; Most of my issues were resolved, but it took multiple phone calls, and full knowledge of my rights.<br /><br />That said, the blg I was in was rundown, very old, and not well-updated - one 15 watt of electricity for the entire two bedroom apt without grounded outlets - which meant you blew fuses on a regular basis.&nbsp; The blg also had roach, mice and all sorts of other bug problems.&nbsp; The last straw was the bed bug problem, which hastened my departure.&nbsp; &nbsp;I was probably more vocal than most about the problem, but it did result in getting the entire blg, and all units granted access to, exterminated twice for bed bugs.&nbsp; I could not beleive that people knew about this problem but most had chosen not to speak up about it, whether out of fear or indifference, I think it was both.&nbsp; &nbsp;Unfortunately, if your neighbors do not let exterminators in, the pests accumulate and just come thru the walls to every other apartment.<br /><br />When I moved in, the unit was negotiated lower based on my good credit.&nbsp; Subsequently, every year the rent was raised to max rent stab laws allowed, and was non-negotiable.&nbsp; Upon looking for apts with new realtors, I was told of his slumlord reputation, and quite a few said they did not work with him because renting to him reflected badly on their real estate company.&nbsp; &nbsp;Be aware.<br /><br />All I can say is good luck.&nbsp; I have yet to hear of one positive experience with this landlord.

				Hi Daisy,<br /><br />What kind of problems did you have with them besides Pest Control?<br /><br />The pest control company that is supposed to come to our bld once a month did not come in July, and the black out/heat wave caused a bug problem in our place, so we paid for an exterminator to come. I took it out of the rent, and included the reciepts, so I&#39;m just waiting for the lanlord to respond (he hasn&#39;t cashed our rent check yet) but I&#39;m not expecting it to be easy..&nbsp; Is the monthly pest control that they&#39;re supposed to provide in a lease, where is it stated?

				are you in 38th and Ditmars?&nbsp; The exterminator there came once a month, and the super was really nice about you giving the key so they could exterminate if you weren&#39;t home.&nbsp; Also had the schedule as well.&nbsp; This website is a great resource for finding out your rights -http://www.housingnyc.com/html/resources/faq/quality.html#exterminate<br /><br />I&#39;d be very nervous about those bed bugs, be very careful.&nbsp; They just came thru the walls and invaded everyone&#39;s apartments.&nbsp; The vacuum is your best friend.&nbsp; If you are getting bit, you may have them.<br /><br />I remember his leases being very by the book, but don&#39;t recall anything about extermination in them.&nbsp; However, they did send someone the very next day after my many numerous frantic phonecalls about the bed bugs.&nbsp; I admit, I freaked out when I discovered them, but who in their right mind wouldn&#39;t?&nbsp; I did not pay for any of the three visits to exterminate them.&nbsp; Call the office, follow up, write letters, educate yourself of your rights.&nbsp; They did fix problems although it took a long time.<br /><br />Also did you put down a key deposit?&nbsp; They are supposed to be illegal but I did get mine back upon moving out.&nbsp; Also you are owed interest on your security when you move out, but most landlords pocket the money.&nbsp; I managed to get this as well, through numerous phonecalls.

				I am trying to find out as much information as possible on Pistilli Riverview East Apartments (City view)<br />If any on has put in to purchase any of the unites if so have you been given a date on when you can move in?<br /><br />My husband and I are both from Astoria and we have been living in NJ<br />for the last 5 years but are looking to move back. When we heard about<br />this new building and went to see it&nbsp; in November of 2006 we were very<br />excited. We went to see the apartments and loved one of them and<br />decided to purchase it. The Pistilli group told us we need to make a<br />decision fast and put a deposit right away in order to secure the unit<br />we loved. Pistilli mentioned they were due to close on the units<br />starting at the end of February.<br />Needless to say today is July 2nd and we still have no where to go and <br />we closed on our house and moved out end of March!!!!<br />any other person in the same situation?<br />k4sting :oops:

				Hi, <br />I looked at the units several times and got the prospectus.&nbsp; I&nbsp; decided not to pursue it at this moment. I would need to sell my place first and I could only afford a much smaller space in there than what I have now. But I still think about &#039;what if&#039;.&nbsp; I remember them telling me that they would be opening it up, I think in May or June.&nbsp; <br />What was their most recent estimate of a move-in date for you?<br />

				This concerns me greatly.&nbsp; You should go to their offices on 28th Avenue and demand a response.&nbsp; The place does not look quite ready yet.&nbsp; As someone who has put down a deposit, you should know when the apartment will be ready.&nbsp; They owe you some information.

				I brought a unit at Pistilli Riverview East as well. My closing was suppose to be on May 8th but due to NYC Certification it had to be postponed. I was there two weeks ago and was informed that they pasted the first phase of certification and are now in the last phase. They were working with Con Edison on the electric wiring to the units. Spoke to the workers privately and they are confident that by end of July they should be done. I will be going next week to check up on the progress.&nbsp;

				A guy in my building bought one of those apartments, but I don&#039;t know if he actually did his closing yet.<br />Our building is owned by Pistilli and I that&#039;s why he went for it. I saw him last week and asked him when<br />he&#039;d be leaving. <br /><br />His response was &quot;probably not till end of August or early September, there&#039;s still more work to be done.&quot;<br /><br />But I know from experience having been a Pistilli tenant - he bought my building about 20 years ago - they&#039;re<br />very unprofessional in his office. When you get paperwork from them, check the dates, spellings and details <br />carefully. And keep copies of everything&nbsp; -- which I&#039;m sure you already do.<br /><br />You may have to go to their office, as another poster suggested. Followup and returning calls is not their strong suit.<br /><br />Good luck!<br />

				Pistilli seems to be every where in Astoria but very hard to find them <br />I did stop at the 28th Ave office one time it was just a secretary there and a desk <br />she had no information, since then they have rented that office to a medical office<br />and they are not there any more.<br />thank you for the updates and as you meet people who have purchased into the building <br />please direct them to this post. I think by our self&#039;s we are not getting anywhere maybe <br />if we all get together we might be able to get some answers from them.<br />this is the most amazing experience they are so unprofessional<br />k4sting

				Did you get your loan through Pistilli&#039;s bank, First Central?&nbsp; Because he is probably the only bank that would give a loan for that property.&nbsp; Most banks require at least 50% of the units be sold first, some even 80%.&nbsp; They can not even give you a straight answer when you ask them how many units are sold.&nbsp; I keep getting &quot;A couple&quot; as a response.&nbsp; Co-ops are a big risk for banks, and with Pistilli&#039;s name being on it, the risk is even greater.&nbsp; The asking prices are through the roof, and the maintenance fees are also high, why??? Because he has until 2012 to payoff Eagle Electric, who still owns the land.&nbsp; 2012 is around the corner, what happens if he doesn&#039;t pay it off???&nbsp; And besides, the quality of work in the units are so poor, you would have to buy it and renovate it right away.

				There is a beautiful, friendly, 7-year-old female Rottweiler that Pistilli has been using to guard his Riverview Towers.&nbsp; She lives (and has lived for a wicked long time now) alone in the garage.&nbsp; She rarely sees the light of day, rarely goes outside and rarely has any company.<br /><br />Some of the workers pay attention to her a little bit - they&#039;ll walk from time to time, play with her a little here and there when they can, but basically this poor dog lives confined and alone with no human or animal companions.<br /><br />Somehow, she is still super sweet and friendly.&nbsp; <br /><br />I was told the building is set to &#039;open&#039; 9/1...which means in a few weeks Pistilli needs to find someone to take the dog because she won&#039;t be &quot;needed&quot; anymore.<br /><br />Apparently, they&#039;ll put an ad on Craigslist or something in an effort to find her a home.<br /><br />If I could take this gorgeous girl myself I would, but we&#039;ve already got a dog and you all know how hard it is to rent an apartment in Astoria if you have a dog, especially if it&#039;s a Rottweiler...<br /><br />Let&#039;s hope this sweetie gets a lovely home with an owner who will love and care for her the way she deserves to be taken care of.&nbsp; <br /><br />Maybe one of you fits the bill... :-)<br />

				just because there is a hand written sign on a door that means &quot;sold&quot; doesn&#039;t mean it actually is.<br /><br />my bf and i went by early july. just hillariously bad. and the maintenance is out of this world. <br /><br />not to throw dirt in anyone&#039;s face that bought on this board --- its just bad.<br /><br />and the kitchens, -- you have to gut these places the appliances are so cheap.&nbsp; i asked the tour guide if they units could just come empty and his reply was no. i was like, you should just sell the space raw at half the price and let people design. that would be easier then putting in the CHEAPEST materials possible. <br /><br />i couldn&#039;t get over in some of the units how huge the closets were, but yet the kitchens and bathrooms were miniscule.&nbsp; and about the kitchens -- i was informed i was used to seeing &quot;manhattan kitchens&quot; and that these were merely &quot;queens kitchenettes&quot; -- because queens people don&#039;t cook because the restaurants are so good.<br />&nbsp;that is literally what he said.

				I went there with my wife this past weekend.&nbsp; And yes, I too was shocked by the extremely poor set-up of this place.&nbsp; It looks like they hired the person who graduated last in thier class at the worst architectural school in Kazakhstan.&nbsp; <br /><br />Honestly, I had such high hopes for this place.&nbsp; Large space, right next to the park, bus stop at the foot of the building...heck, I was even hoping that the ground floor would have been turned into a mini-supermarket so that way you can just pick up something when you get home from work (or that late night snack that you need).&nbsp; But this whole place is turning into a real-eastate disaster, the likes of which I&#039;ve never seen in this neighborhood before.&nbsp; <br /><br />Even at a rental, it&#039;ll be hard pressed to have good tenants find this place appealing.&nbsp; I&#039;ll say a prayer for those of you who bought into this property already.

				I couldn&#039;t agree more here... I went to look at these places recently (mostly because of what I read on this board), and I can&#039;t see this place even getting off the ground.<br /><br />1)&nbsp; Nobody in their right mind would pay 800K for a large 2 bedroom in this place (especially being a co-op)... I suspect, if the seller is desperate, you could easily low-ball them 2-300K on the asking price since you&#039;ll have to put at least 100K into the larger units to actually fix them up (assuming the board even approves you to do this)<br />2)&nbsp; The lofts are ridiculously laid out (The large martini glass pillars in the bedrooms are hilarious)<br />3)&nbsp; The quality of the construction was terrible throughout the inside and outside of the building <br />-- we could see real evidence of water damage in certain units in the ceiling (I suspect the plumbing is very cheaply done, like the rest of the&nbsp; building)<br />-- The vinyl flooring was already coming un-done<br />-- The kitchens were an absolute joke (the cabinets were already falling apart)<br />-- Any wood work done in the units looked like it was produced by a grade 9 shop class<br /><br />For those that bought into this place, I feel for you... I really do.&nbsp; The fact of the matter is that there are many large 1000 sqft+ units in this building that will probably never sell... I can&#039;t see people from the city buying into this place at all.<br /><br />-Your Mother<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=6902.msg89572#msg89572">Quote from: TJT on August 24, 2007, 01:00:39 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">And say a prayer for those of us who live near it.&nbsp; I have genuine fears that this will go belly up and lay vacant.&nbsp; Smashed windows, rats, squatters, etc. etc.&nbsp; Pretty much what I heard it was for years before the magnificent idea to convert it to housing.&nbsp; (I wasn&#039;t in the area at that time but that&#039;s what I was told it was like in the 90s)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				My wife and I checked it out yesterday, just to see what it&#039;s like.&nbsp; It is truly awful!&nbsp; The place we looked at was a two bedroom.&nbsp; It was listed at 715k with $1800/month maintenance.&nbsp; Not only is that price insane for anything around here, but it was just AWFUL inside!&nbsp; <br /><br />The living room was very spacious and well lit and the bedrooms were pretty big, but the kitchen was TINY and there was plenty of space that they could have made them bigger and beautiful.&nbsp; The toilet looked like it was pulled out of the garbage and thrown into the common bathroom and the master bathroom had a jacuzzi tub with no shower.&nbsp; The cabinets in the bathrooms looked like they were from Ikea and they hadn&#039;t even put the hardware on half the equipment.<br /><br />I can&#039;t believe they&#039;ll be able to sell any of these units.&nbsp; The &quot;tour guide&quot; didn&#039;t even make an effort to stop us from walking out the door as we laughed and talked with the other folks in there with us about how awful it was.&nbsp;

				so i past by the pistilli complex today, it looks like they are getting ready to open or something cause they had the grand opening flags...but there was also a big sign that had directions to the Sales office, i think they&#039;re getting desperate to get people to buy into the place...if they reduce the price and maintenance by 70%, i&#039;d consider it

				In my continuing, futile attempts to counter the negative hostility on this board, I would like to point out the positives of this development.&nbsp; &nbsp;I feel that anyone browsing through the threads deserves a balanced picture of this place.&nbsp; They have certainly heard plenty about the drawbacks.&nbsp; Not everyone agrees the building is the hellhole most posters here make it out to be.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Positives:<br /><br />- Large square footage in apartments - much larger than anything else we looked at when shopping&nbsp; &nbsp; around Astoria.<br /><br />- Location, location, location:&nbsp; Right on Astoria Park!<br /><br />- 2/3 bedrooms have 2 bathrooms - and start at around $500k.&nbsp; (I do agree that <span class="bbc_u">some</span> of these units are overpriced for this neighborhood.&nbsp; But not all.)<br /><br />- Many have balconies<br /><br />- Many have nice views - the better the view, the higher the $$ of course<br /><br />- Bus stop directly in front of the building<br /><br />- Doorman<br /><br />- Exercise rooms<br /><br />- Zoned for PS 122&nbsp; - an excellent k-8 school with the middle school having a reputation as one of the best in the city<br /><br />- Time Out NY named 19th street along the park one of the &quot;top 50 blocks&quot; to live on in the city.&nbsp; The building is not on that exact block, but pretty darn close!<br /><br />- Lots of good restaurants/shops within walking distance<br /><br />- Nice neighbors:&nbsp; we have met some of the others who have bought units in the building and everyone is very friendly, smart, nice, professionals - many have been in Astoria for a long time.&nbsp; &nbsp;In our case, I am a television writer/producer and my husband is a chemical engineer.&nbsp; We have been renting in Astoria for 7 years.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				$500k does look like a bargain.&nbsp; if you ignore the cheap quality of EVERYTHING.<br />&nbsp; <br />However - the really expensive part is the $1/square foot maintenance.&nbsp; So ... take the $500k unit - that&#039;s 1200 sq. ft (200 is outside on your balcony) and then you have to pay $1200/month in maintenance to upkeep a place that was poorly built in the first place.&nbsp; <br /><br />500k is no longer a bargain when you have to continue paying 1/2 of you current rent each month.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />AND the exercise rooms ... bah... don&#039;t get me started.&nbsp; An alcove in a hallway&nbsp; - where i&#039;m sure the equipment is going to match the rest of the quality in the building.&nbsp; Cheap! Not well done. <br />

				Went to see the place last month.&nbsp; Its not that the appliances are cheap, its that the construction is cheap and you cant replace that.<br /><br />-wood floors were put down like a laminate. Now all bubbled up and there were sagging dips in the floors of all 5 apartments we looked at.<br />-cracked marble molding everywhere.<br />-dark hallways<br />-exercise room turned out to be in front of two apartment entrances where 1 couch and two chairs should have gone.&nbsp; can you imagine the odor and noise every time you walk past that spot?<br />-the interior apartments have giant windows facing opposite apartment windows or sitting areas.&nbsp; People will be looking down at you at all times unless you put up black out curtains.<br />-the incredible maintenance costs.&nbsp; You might as well by something by Gantry park for 70K more but with half the maintenance fees.<br /><br />And the best part!&nbsp; Our &quot;salesman&quot; was a young 20 something yutz who didnt wear a jacket, tried to make conversation by talking about an ex teacher of his that tried to fail him in high school and how he almost failed his regents exam. Then went on to explain that they will fix the shoddy construction when the place is finished by rehiring only the good construction guys to redo the apartmets.&nbsp; When I asked why they didnt just do that know he mentioned that there is a contract to get the work done and &quot;you know how t is&quot; the crews just want to get each place done and get out, they dont care about doing a good job.&nbsp; WOW what a salesman.&nbsp; you would think that for 500k + they would have a qualified sales team in place.&nbsp; You could have swapped these people with the hostess and bussing staff at Neptune diner.<br /><br />Oh, we didn&#039;t buy a place there if you were wondering.

				OK, let me address some of these concerns:<br /><br />- The building is new construction which means everything comes with a warranty.&nbsp; Everything.&nbsp; So if something goes wrong or breaks down, guess what?&nbsp; They have to replace it.&nbsp; And frankly these accusations of cheap construction have been blown way out of proportion.&nbsp; It&#039;s not a completely false observation, but it&#039;s not as dire as some would have you believe.<br /><br />- You have a final inspection as a buyer.&nbsp; So if there&#039;s a crack in your molding or the floors are not up to snuff, guess what?&nbsp; They have to fix that before you move in.&nbsp; I am sure that&#039;s how they plan to handle any deficiencies that have developed in particular units.&nbsp; They have a lot of apartments in that building, over 100 - it&#039;s difficult to keep up with all of them at the same time while trying to get the building open. And also remember how long these units have been up.&nbsp; They&#039;ve been moving at a snail&#039;s pace for years.&nbsp; So that&#039;s years of exposure these units have had with no owners to keep up with them.<br /><br />- Exercise rooms - whatever.&nbsp; We were perfectly happy with what they showed us.&nbsp; Picking on the exercise rooms is just being curmudgeonly.&nbsp; I suppose you&#039;re looking for a five star resort gym and spa in your $300k one bedroom apt purchase?<br /><br />- Costs - we&#039;ve run our numbers with mortgage, maintenance, tax deductions, the whole bit.&nbsp; We&#039;re satisfied that the costs are within our budget and is absolutely not out of line with other new coop developments.&nbsp; &nbsp;Maintenance depends on the size of your unit.&nbsp; If you can&#039;t afford a big place, well, that&#039;s not the building&#039;s fault.<br /><br />- Bottom line - and obviously I can only speak for us personally -&nbsp; the following were important to us in an apt:&nbsp; spaciousness, location, the community within and around the building and a cost that fit our budget.&nbsp; We have gotten everything we wanted on those points and then some with this purchase.&nbsp; And while you continue to lob insults, just remember there are people in this neighborhood and on this board who are going to make this place their home soon.&nbsp; You insult the development, you&#039;re insulting us by default.&nbsp; &nbsp;If this place isn&#039;t for you for whatever reason, that&#039;s fine.&nbsp; But I refuse to sit back and watch our future home and our decisions to purchase there get ripped to shreds any longer on this board.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Crocker – welcome to the neighborhood.<br /><br />I’m left to wonder after reading your post that if you’re as happy with your purchase and if the Riverview East is as great as you say, why do take it so personally that you feel insulted if someone criticizes the building? <br /><br />You and other people may feel the prices are a bargain for the space, and perhaps judged by a Manhattan standard they are but 300K-500K apartments are not considered cheap for Astoria, at least by me.<br /><br />I haven’t viewed any apartments and am not likely to but judging by the looks of the exterior of the building, and the other Pistilli property on Ditmars – the construction looks cheap and in my opinion sums up what’s wrong with some of the real estate develops in the neighborhood.<br /><br /><br /><br />Has the question been answered on what happens when the lease to the property comes up? Will the tenants be forced to buy out the landowner? There was talk of&nbsp; a contingency fund to cover the cost but I wonder if this is true or will it be up to the apartment owners to cough up the dough when the time comes.<br /><br /><br />

				Krocker, so you are saying you bought an apartment. Congratulations.&nbsp; You are also being defensive about your purchase.&nbsp; Totally understandable and perhaps correct in parts.&nbsp; We DID go there in hopes of buying but it did not work out for us.&nbsp; I am allowed to express my views here and have done so.

No one is forcing you.<br /><br />Now for my opinion : have a gut feeling you may work or be related to someone very close to this project, again, just a hunch with no base, but my opinion. Enjoy and let us know when you move in.<br /><br />

				I haven&#039;t seen the places, so I can&#039;t say from first hand experience.&nbsp; I&#039;m speaking in more general terms and not specifically about this place.&nbsp; I can&#039;t even come remotely close to affording half a million, so it&#039;s a mute point.<br /><br />My main reasons for not wanting to buy an apartment is because I don&#039;t want to have to pay a monthly fee.&nbsp; I see a main point of owning a place is to not have to pay rent anymore.&nbsp; Paying a monthly fee, to me at least, is rent.&nbsp; Even when you are done with your mortgage, you&#039;re still paying rent.&nbsp; If you can afford it, more power to you, and I think it&#039;s great.&nbsp; And yeah, I understand you&#039;re gaining equity in owning.&nbsp; But it just doesn&#039;t make sense for me personally.<br /><br />Good luck in the new digs when they finally open it up.&nbsp; It really is a great location.

				OK now its my turn to throw in my 2 cents&nbsp; :-D<br /><br />Krocker: As a soon to be Riverview East owner as well, we have no control over what others on this board or any other board say about the property. If you are serious about investing the rule of thumb states that you turn to your inner circle for advise (ie: lawyers, accountants, relatives, current economic bracket, etc) not a board of strangers. So I would not worry about a potential investor being discouraged from buying after reading the threads. If you are going to let a board talk you out of buying then in my opinion you are only &quot;window shopping&quot;.<br /><br />Moveover, I agree that some of the statements concerning Pistilli have been a bit over the top but some people can&#039;t think outside of the box or the bigger picture for that matter.

				Krocker and Latinguy,<br /><br />Welcome to the neighborhood!&nbsp; I live down the block (purchased a house on 19th Street seven years ago) and I love it!&nbsp; My husband and I toured the building.&nbsp; I think that some of the points on this board are correct, but some are outrageously exaggerated.&nbsp; I fell in love with the amount of light that comes into the apartments in the front of the building.&nbsp; Light and closet space are important to me and some of the apartments had an abundance of both.<br /><br />It is a pity that real estate in this area has become so expensive, and with homes going for $800,000+ it makes sense to purchase a condo or coop.&nbsp; Also, to those folks who are stating that the materials are cheap, have a look at some of those relic homes on the market for nearly a million!&nbsp; My neighbors purchased two years ago and paid $780,000 and had to put in another $100,000 in repairs and they are still working on it!<br /><br />I have heard that the &#039;glass house&#039; on Astoria Park South went for over a million and there was a year worth of repairs made to that house.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, I congratulate both of you and look forward to meeting you when you move in!

				Hello all!<br />I am new to this board but have been reading the many posts regarding the Riverview Apartments. We too have purchased a unit there. I am from Astoria born and raised and so is my wife. We left here for a stint in NJ, but now we are back. Let me first say that the opinions of people regarding this development are just that, opinions. People have every right to state what they feel is good or bad about anything. People have different &quot;crap&quot; levels. All I would like to say is that we are all lucky to have a place we can call home whether its an apartment, house, rental or purchase, as cheesy as a building may look. There are many people less fortunate then we are. So who cares what people say about the place, enjoy your new home for the reasons you want to. Some people just don&#039;t &quot;get it&quot;.&nbsp; My wife and I have looked for a long time all over Queens and to be able to get a place that is 1400 sq feet for $500,000 is a nice deal. All developers use cheap materials it is called making money. The only place we saw that was over the top in amenities and quality of extras was the Arris lofts in LIC. 800 sq ft for $825,000! There is a building on 31st ave. new, nice looking, cost for 2 bedroom (really 1 the other looked the size of a closet) $600,000 + $40,000 if you wanted to buy a parking spot!! yes that is not a typo... $40,000&nbsp; to purchase a parking spot that is what there sales person told us. Riverview I believe is $150 per month. <br />Anyway, just wanted to post and introduce myself. looking forward to our new digs. Hopefully be able to move in soon.<br />&nbsp;<br />We are happy to be home! :-D<br /><br />Ciao

				Good to hear some more support for the building...<br /><br />As someone looking to get a place in the apartments, I&#039;ve read through all of the opinions and can understand the frustrations...one&#039;s home can be a very personal thing, and everyone has their opinions.&nbsp; What it really comes down to is what is important for each of us in our idea of home.&nbsp; For some, the emergence of a proportionately large condo building in a primarily 2 family house neighborhood is an unwelcome intrusion.&nbsp; For me , it could also mean a shift in the character of the neighborhood.&nbsp; Is it good or bad?&nbsp; will each unit remake their space?&nbsp; Will the co-op board change how the back exterior looks?&nbsp; There&#039;s no way of telling for sure.&nbsp; I&#039;m excited to see what&#039;s possible.&nbsp; The neighborhood has been changing, and I think that&#039;s a good for any community.&nbsp; I&#039;m all for hearing criticism, but I think some of the frustration I&#039;ve felt has been from posts that are primarily speculation or uninformed.&nbsp; We&#039;re all here saying something because it&#039;s important enough to us to express ourselves about it, and it&#039;s great that this has become a heated topic of discussion.. and I hope to hear a lot more about from everyone about it.

				Folks - I am so excited that you are coming into the neighborhood.&nbsp; I have been waiting for years for folks to finally move in!&nbsp; You should know the following - our neighborhood is amazing for ten months of the year.&nbsp; We feel like we are in the country - it is so peaceful.&nbsp; The park is used by elderly, children with their parents, joggers, dog walkers etc. and most of us know each other!&nbsp; From the beginning of July until Labor Day however, it is challenging.&nbsp; The crowds come to the pool, it gets very dirty, it gets noisy, motorcycles race around the park etc.&nbsp; We (some of the participants on this forum) are trying to organize a meeting with our local representatives to discuss some of Astoria&#039;s quality of life issues.&nbsp; It would probably be quite educational for you to attend.&nbsp; Look out for the date / time on Astorians.com.&nbsp; Also, please do not let anything discourage you.&nbsp; This is a wonderful place to live!

				I&#039;d just like to say congrats to everyone who purchased a new home there.&nbsp; Good luck, everyone!&nbsp; <br /><br />The idea of being able to basically redesign your apartment is really cool.&nbsp; But does that mean you can change the rooms?&nbsp; For example, tear down the kitchen and make it bigger if you wanted to?&nbsp; Or get rid of a bedroom and make the living room bigger?&nbsp; Obviously these are all hypothetical, but is that something you can do if you choose?

				So... back when a friend visited during one of the first open houses, 2 bedrooms were going for 500k, 3 bdrms for 750... i was perusing the nytimes, and it appears to say that a 3 bdrm there is now going for $260. <br /><br />Are they doing a bait and switch (yes, we *said* 3 bdrms, but that price was actually &quot;prices *start* at 260... for a studio...&quot;) or have they really lowered prices that much?<br /><br />Very curious.<br /><br />alia

				The purchase of the land is being financed by a &#039;wrap mortgage&#039;, a pretty common financial instrument.&nbsp; The prospectus describes the plan in detail.&nbsp; But the bottom line is the owners will not have to shell out.&nbsp; <br /><br />As far as additional stories go, your question was the first I&#039;d heard of it...?

				My wife and I took a tour of the facilities on Saturday.&nbsp; Our sales agent was an idiot who couldn&#039;t actually answer any questions other than the square footage and price of each apartment he showed us.&nbsp; I asked him if I could rip up the floor and put in new ones, since they were all laminate instead of real wood, and he couldn&#039;t answer me.<br /><br />The closet spaces in some of the apartments, especially the two bedrooms, are unreal.&nbsp; They&#039;re GIGANTIC!&nbsp; Between the closets and the other spaces they offer for storage, nobody should have a problem fitting all of their things.&nbsp; That being said, you could fit two of their kitchens in one closet.&nbsp; I can&#039;t figure out why they splurged for the closets and cut back for the kitchens.&nbsp; A few of the apartments have kitchens that are more open, but most of them have smaller-than-usual refrigerators and, when the fridge door is open, you can&#039;t actually move in the kitchen.&nbsp; It blocks the entrance.&nbsp; Cabinets were terrible.&nbsp; I imagine most people will replace them as soon as they move in.<br /><br />There was one kitchen that had an immovable column built in with tiny, random space behind it - nothing you could do anything with.&nbsp; One of the lofts was set up this way as well.<br /><br />Could have been my imagination, but there were moments in both the hallways and apartments where I felt like the floor was not quite level.<br /><br />Finally, two of the apartments they showed us had cracked windows and water damage.&nbsp; I understand these things will be fixed, but...wouldn&#039;t it behoove you to either fix those now, or show different apartments?<br /><br />I took home their brochure.&nbsp; I think this may have been mentioned already, but in their pitch about great restaurants, they have a photo of the Egyptian place on Steinway...not exactly a close walk.<br /><br />I believe our sales <del>putz</del> agent said that there were 186 units, and so far, 45 have been sold.

				Just visited the apartments on Sunday. Thought they were better than the overall negative opinion of this board. They were spacious enough and there was good light. The layout of the apartments was suspect. The kitchens were horrible. very small with small appliances.<br />The bathroom fixtures were rather budget. But for the price I thought it was a good deal. It wasn&#039;t anything like LIC prices. Although the maintenance fee seemed exorbitant - $1 for every sq ft. <br />Not surprising overall that only 45 out of 186 units have sold.

				Having visited the co-op quite a few times, I can say it has both it&#039;s strengths and weaknesses...<br /><br />To address the last few posts:<br /><br /><strong>Sales staff:</strong> Some of them are not experienced at all.&nbsp; Regarding the &quot;putz&quot; salesman, I think I know who you may be referring you to.&nbsp; He&#039;s usually the person who comes to the lobby to escort prospective buyers to the sales office.&nbsp; The saleswoman who originally showed us the units, Athena, was helpful and easy to talk to.<br />Realize, though, that most of the sales staff won&#039;t know the answers to questions about alterations and other specific things.&nbsp; A good part of this is mainly because this is a new development that doesn&#039;t have any preexisting policy regarding rights/responsibilities/etc.&nbsp; Many things may have not been determined yet...which gives all the tenants and buyers a strong negotiating position.&nbsp; Bottom line is, the most effective person to talk to in the sales office is Kevin Riley, the Sales Director.&nbsp; He&#039;s been able to answer pretty much every question we&#039;ve had, and has always admitted to a &quot;that hasn&#039;t been determined yet.&quot;&nbsp; Although he usually doesn&#039;t show the units, he&#039;s the one you want to talk to first thing after seeing the units.<br /><br /><strong>Kitchens:</strong> - Everyone is in agreement that the kitchens are small...the bigger question behind that, however, is if the kitchens are too small to be workable.&nbsp; The unit I&#039;m pursuing has a C - shaped kitchen, where the stove is opposite the dishwasher. At first I said,&quot; I won&#039;t be able to open the stove and the dishwasher at the same time!&quot; - after which I wondered when I would ever in my entire life need to do that.&nbsp; Historically, the kitchen has been gradually shrinking because it&#039;s function has changed so much in the last century.&nbsp; I&#039;m willing to bet that your kitchen is smaller than your parent&#039;s kitchen. If you&#039;re a professional chef, then yes, these kitchens will not be up to par at all.&nbsp; But how much space do you actually need?&nbsp; For some, they won&#039;t work.&nbsp; For me (and I enjoy cooking) the c-shaped kitchen means that everything I need is no more than 2-3 steps away.&nbsp; The fact that the cabinetry stops short of the ceiling will allow me to store books, bottles, and others things above.&nbsp; So, for me, the kitchen works perfectly.&nbsp; Also realize, by law, the appliances have to be above a certain standard to be approved - but why should the developers buy big fridges when a purchaser may most likely replace it with either one they already own or with one they really want. The same goes for the fixtures - most purchasers will also want to customize, so it doesn&#039;t make financial sense to focus your money there.<br /><br />Brochure: Kevin has mentioned that the marketing needs an overhaul, and is cheesy.&nbsp; I think we can all agree on that.<br /><br />Moving in dates:&nbsp; Although still an aggravation, the constant delays in finishing the building and having it ready are not uncommon.&nbsp; A few pages back, someone posted a NYT article about how common this is with new condo/co-op developments in the past two years.. The best way to deal with this is establishing a drop-dead move-in date which can establish a responsibility on their part to have it ready, or suffer financial consequences.<br /><br />the important thing is to ASK QUESTIONS.&nbsp; If someone doesn&#039;t have the answer, ask for someone who will.&nbsp; As a business transaction, you have the right to be fully informed.&nbsp; Most places aren&#039;t trying to hide anything, as anything hidden will be revealed during an appraisal or when a real estate lawyer gets involved.&nbsp; Be ruthless.&nbsp; be a reporter.

My kitchen is smaller than my parent&#039;s kitchen because I grew up in a house in the suburbs, and now I live in an apartment in the city. Maybe I&#039;m weird, but whether I&#039;m in an apartment or a house, I would like the kitchen to be bigger than the bathroom (and that doesn&#039;t mean I want the bathroom to be two feet wide, but the kitchen should be functional as a kitchen and not just a place to reheat food). I&#039;d want enough counter space so that if I need to wash dishes in the sink or am preparing some food to be brought out to the dining room, I don&#039;t have to put plates on the stove in the meantime, or so I don&#039;t have a bunch of vegetables competing for the same foot of counter space when making a salad or sauce. I want enough cabinet space to store various dishes, including plates, bowls, pots, pans, mugs, and glasses. This especially goes if I&#039;m going to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on an apartment. <br /><br />I am not a professional chef. I don&#039;t understand the implication that anyone with the money to buy a nice apartment won&#039;t ever want to cook a large meal.

				I have to think that the size of Manhattan kitchens have historically been shrinking over the years, and that the function of them has changed along with them.&nbsp; This small kitchen &quot;I eat out most of the time&quot; mentality has started to translate into anything new being built not only in Manhattan but to Queens and Brooklyn as well.&nbsp; Go to any of those new luxury McMansions being built all over upstate in the suburbs and you will see a huge kitchen that is in fact way bigger than my parents.&nbsp; &nbsp;I do know a lot of peole who are just fine with a small kitchen.&nbsp; And there are a lot of people who are not.&nbsp; It&#039;s all a matter of preference, but the small kitchen is so prevalent in modern NYC construction that it makes it hard for people who enjoy cooking to be happy with buying a place here.&nbsp; I&#039;m curious to know if the developer could afford to invest in better appliances, fixtures, and construction based on what the place costs.&nbsp; How much money just goes right to their pockets instead?&nbsp; Ultimately, people want different things in buying their place, and I&#039;m glad to hear it&#039;s working out for many of you.

				I will jump in here and say that as a buyer, I would also have liked a bigger kitchen.&nbsp; I mean, who wouldn&#039;t?&nbsp; But as people have stated, it is very common for kitchens in the city to be small.&nbsp; The kitchen I&#039;ve been living with for the past 7 years here in Astoria is hardly what I would call spacious.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think the main problem people had with the kitchens in this place (myself included) is that the apartments are so huge, would it have killed them to make the kitchens a little larger?&nbsp; Who knows what their thought process was there.&nbsp; It couldn&#039;t have cost that much to make it a little bigger.&nbsp; They chose instead to make the bathrooms and closets huge.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, it wasn&#039;t enough of a minus to stop us from buying.&nbsp; And I love this comment:&nbsp; &quot;At first I said,&quot; I won&#039;t be able to open the stove and the dishwasher at the same time!&quot; - after which I wondered when I would ever in my entire life need to do that.&quot;&nbsp; I laughed out loud.&nbsp; I had the same exact reaction!

				What is EIFS?<br />EIFS stands for Exterior Insulation and Finish Systems. The product is also called synthetic stucco, and refers to a multi-layered exterior finish that&#039;s been used in European construction since shortly after World War II, when contractors found it to be a good repair choice for buildings damaged during the war. The majority of repairs to European buildings were to structures constructed of stone, concrete, brick, or other similar, durable materials.<br /><br />EIFS in North America<br />North American builders began using EIFS in the 1980&#039;s, first in commercial buildings, then applying it as an exterior finish to residences--mostly wood frame houses--using the same techniques that had been successful in Europe.<br /><br />Eagle Electric is a stone, brick and concrete structure. The problem with moisture comes with EIFS applied to wood frame homes.&nbsp; &nbsp;:mrgreen:

				I know a waterproofing/roofing contractor that&#039;s specifically putting off his retirement plans 10 years to take full advantage of all the problems he says these styrofoam-type insulated homes will be having in a few years. <br /><br />Personally, I do like the way some of the more tasteful jobs that have been done in the &#039;hood look.&nbsp; But overall, the gaudy, one-upmanship that I&#039;ve noticed in most European home owners have killed it for me.

				I just had a brief conversation with Kevin. <br />It seems that they have passed the FD inspection. What concerns me the most is their inefficiency and lack of knowledge in executing all the necessary steps in order to expedite a move in date before the Holidays. <br /><br />Lets hope Kevin doesn&#039;t get sick b/c it seems - at least from the front line, this is a one man&#039;s show. <br />I would love to go into details on our whole experience with the sales office and its staff, but it&#039;s not worth any key strokes. Perhaps, once we&#039;re all into our apts we can share our experiences.<br /><br />What has aggravated me the most, are not the &quot;lies&quot; (b/c it&#039;s part of the job - to certain extent), but the inability to be consistent. It is a mystery, how can someone that works almost 7 days/week on one project cannot convey trust to us (the buyers) that they are on-top of things, knowledgeable, but rather coming across like they are new to the field and that they just got hired recently. I guess it&#039;s called &quot;low IQ&quot;<br /><br />Regarding all the comments regarding the building, whether this is considered a good &quot;buy&quot; or not:<br />If everyone thought the same way, everyone would make the same decisions and there would be a no arbitrage opportunity out there - in terms of an investment. So to the Buyers, Potential Buyers and to those that just post out-of boredom. Do your research, educate yourself, take a view, make a decision, stick to your decision and don’t be concerned by anyone&#039;s comments. Unless, the news/info is coming from a reliable source that can add some value to your decision, the rest is just white noise. <br /><br />Me and my wife bought an apt on the 1st FL.<br />Ethnicity: Greek<br />Age: 29<br />Job: Investment Banking

Astoria used to be a family Community. Folks got married and moved into an apartment within walking distance of their parents. Now, they can no longer afford to live in Astoria. I remember when large, prewar buildings had 2–3 generations living there. When the mail carriers needed to know first names to put the mail in the correct mailbox. Now I see the apartment listings above my mailboxes which have 3–4 different last names in each apartment, because it takes that many people to afford the rent. I just find the situation sad; very, very sad. Not all of us aspired to ownership. We simply wanted to live comfortable surrounded by loved ones.

				NYCMacUser: my posting was not mock the current vs. past situation of Astoria boom. I intend to continue making Astoria a family community. Sad but true things do change. I grew up in Bayside (Bay Terrace) and the area today is nothing to what it was in the 80&#039;s. But with that said, there is still a sense of community and respect between the old timers like my parents and the new comers. My parents still get invited to Rosh Hashanah celebrations by their Jewish neighbors and live comfortably surrounded by loved ones even though they are not blood related. <br /><br />

I am sorry, but I cannot agree with the premise. The rich and the poor cannot live in harmony. Not in these times. Astoria will now be a part of the <em>nouveau riche</em> experience because of the prices that are surrounding us. The rents, the property ownership, the restaurants, the small shops, all are slowly becoming too expensive for the average person. <br /><br />Even many of the local supermarkets have changed to suit the needs of the these folks. One of them discontinued stocking dozens of food items to put in a whole isle cooler of assorted beers. Even the pasta isles have changed. Imported means higher prices and the average person can&#039;t afford any higher prices. <br /><br />When postage-sized, studio apartments rent for $1600–$1800, and people who obviously have the money rent them, everything goes up. When a one bedroom condo sells for $450,000–$700,000 and people who can afford to pay that move into a community, they will be living their lifestyle and the neighborhood will be catering to them, and no longer concerned about the rest of the residents. <br /><br />I was recently broadsided on 31st Street and Astoria Boulevard by a man driving a Lexus. When I asked him for his ID I saw that he lived in the luxury, Manhattan style and priced Gantry. He walked over to me while I was writing down his information and asked me if we could settle &quot;it&quot; right then and there because he was in a real rush to get to some kind of meeting. Then he reached into his pants pocket and pulled out a wad of hundred dollars bills. He started to peel them off and he handed me a dozen or so. He literally shoved them in my face like I was supposed to drool or something. I guess this is how you live when you have all that money to flaunt. <br /><br />There are no luxury cars parked on MY block. People still greet each other by name. People who don&#039;t work know that they shouldn&#039;t use the laundry room on the weekends because that is the only time working folks have to do their laundry. I guess it&#039;s a matter of attitude. With all these luxury condos going up I fear that the flavor of Astoria will immeasurably change, and not for the betterment of the Community, but for the comfort and convenience of those luxury condo owners.<br /><br />Astorians.com has a couple of threads dealing with where you come from. I wish someone would start a thread about where you plan on retiring and you will see that those luxury condo owners will be fleeing Astoria when the time comes and the community will be left in shambles.<br /><br />I have 2 sons living in Los Angeles. They scoped out these condos the last time they were in town. They both agreed that they could get twice as much for the buck, at half the prices these places were asking. <br /><br />I know things get more expensive all the time, but it sickens me to think that if North America has to revisit a downsizing/outsourcing period ever again that these buildings and their tenants will have to abandon our Community and it will be left without a waterfront for people to enjoy and boutique-like shops that will no longer be able to make the exorbitant rents and we will be so over-developed and so over-priced that Astoria will never be able to sustain itself as a middle-class, family oriented, affordable Community.<br /><br />Of course, this is just my opinion, and at my age, it is fairly safe to assume that I will no longer be here to see it happen.

				I see what you are saying, but I do think this is happening everywhere and not just in Astoria.&nbsp; It happened first in all of Manhattan, and then anywhere close to Manhattan.&nbsp; It happened in most of Brooklyn anywhere near the city and now it&#039;s happening in Queens, anywhere close to Manhattan.&nbsp; It happens in Jersey City and Hoboken, Long Island, Westchester, and even as far away as Duchess County.&nbsp; It&#039;s telling to see that anything new being built is either specifically luxury (more often) or specifically low-income (less often).&nbsp; What about for us middle-income folk?&nbsp; Those who live on 30K - 80K?&nbsp; But I can&#039;t say it&#039;s correct to say that no one worked on Wall Street from Astoria before now, and I can&#039;t lay blame with those who buy luxury.&nbsp; It&#039;s not that simple, and I don&#039;t have all the answers.&nbsp; Developers ignore middle income people, and it&#039;s incredibly frustrating.

				NYMacUser, you are pessimistic.&nbsp; I learned a long time ago that I cannot expect things to remain as they are today.&nbsp; When I visit my parent&#039;s hometown overseas, it is not the same place I visited 20 years ago.&nbsp; I feel nostalgia for the old days, but I understand that change is a part of life.&nbsp; I miss the old neighborhood, I miss my Aunts and Uncles who have passed, and I miss the simple way of life.&nbsp; Even in this relatively small town on a relatively small island in the Meditteranean, life in the past 30 years has changed drastically.<br /><br />Just to be clear, my husband and I have friends from all walks of life who sit on our porch.&nbsp; Most live in the area.&nbsp; We have a friend who is a pilot, a lady who works in a pita bread factory, two Grandmothers who look after their Grandchildren, our neighbors include two professional photographers, a CPA, an Attorney and other professionals.&nbsp; We all get along, we all greet each other, we have great fun.&nbsp; There is room for all of us - the professionals, the Grandmothers, the factory workers.<br /><br />Also, the Astoria I grew up in (from 1973 to 1993) was Archie Bunker territory.&nbsp; Sorry, but this is true.&nbsp; Perhaps your area was better, but I could not wait to get away from the narrow minded, racsist folks who lived in my area.&nbsp; Most are dead today and the people who have moved in tend to be far more open minded, well traveled, well read etc.&nbsp; I am happy with some of the change, but I do not like the overcrowding, expensive rents, no place to park etc.&nbsp; I think we should work on solving the quality of life issues so that we can all live together in Astoria.

It&#039;s America. I&#039;ve said this before, but I grew up in a Connecticut suburb where most of the houses were modest colonials, and now not only are all the new ones going up mansion-like (and cheaply built, of course) things awkwardly placed in the middle of fields, but people are putting bizarre additions on the older houses and cutting down all the trees in the yard. It disgusts me to go home and see how much it&#039;s all changed. Just like it disgusts my mom, who&#039;s close to 60, to go to the place she grew up. And my dad&#039;s parents, who are around 80, looked on as their formerly wooded back yard became a Circuit City parking lot. They&#039;ve lived in the same house for over 40 years. Yes, the change can be disheartening, but Astoria is not nearly alone in this.

				Am I allowed to agree with everyone, here? &#039;Cause I&#039;m really uncomfortable with the lexus drivers --or at least the group of unthinking and uncaring rich they symbolize. I think there is a major difference in mindset/ what people value, when they never have to worry about money. And for some reason, it often messes with their ability to have empathy with anybody who does have to worry. ...not to get philosophical, but I think people who can buy their way, value other people less because they don&#039;t realize that they need (or might need) other people in the future.<br /><br />And at the same time, I&#039;m afraid I&#039;m part of that upper middle class influx-- at least by the income measure. And we&#039;d stay in Astoria even after we retired--if we could afford to. We&#039;re still not sure if we&#039;ll be able to stay more than 2 years. Ironic, eh?

				Just found this blog.&nbsp; My girlfriend and I bought an apt on the 2nd floor back in 2006. We have been waiting a long time as well and feel like we get the run around either by lies or just lack of knowledge from the sales reps.&nbsp; I&#039;m tired of wasting my time going there to speak to Mr. Reilly or some college student because they are not a reliable source of knowledge.&nbsp; Perhaps we can get all the current buyers together and speak as one voice which I believe would be much more effective.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been talking to a few friends who have had similar issues with their own sponsers and they had formed a group to get their demands made.&nbsp; I believe this is the only way we can be heard and get some kind of compensation for the delay.&nbsp; Let me know your thoughts.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=6902.msg101746#msg101746">Quote from: pdv2101 on November 16, 2007, 03:15:15 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I just had a brief conversation with Kevin. <br />It seems that they have passed the FD inspection.

Perhaps, once we&#039;re all into our apts we can share our experiences.<br /><br />What has aggravated me the most, are not the &quot;lies&quot; (b/c it&#039;s part of the job - to certain extent), but the inability to be consistent. It is a mystery, how can someone that works almost 7 days/week on one project cannot convey trust to us (the buyers) that they are on-top of things, knowledgeable, but rather coming across like they are new to the field and that they just got hired recently.

				I believe that the next World War is not going to be racially or gender based, or another Ethnic Cleansing or even a Jihad. I believe it is going to be the poor against the rich; the have-nots fending off their own decimation from the haves. I believe that everyone will have to take a side because I believe that all human-kind will fall into one or the other category. There will be no middle class to be indecisive. What used to be charming Communities like Astoria will be the new South Bronx of yesteryear. Rotting and abandoned by the wealthy who have gone on to do the same to other nice Communities while the poor are left in their dust to try to salvage their lives.<br /><br />Astoria always had (so-called) white collar people here. We always had 6-figure earners among us. But they didn&#039;t flaunt their wealth and expect the Community to change for them. If you wanted a 4 star meal, you went to Manhattan. You didn&#039;t expect the restaurant to open up in your neighborhood. If you wanted the front of your building kept clean, you spoke to your landlord or picked up a broom and swept it clean yourself. You didn&#039;t expect the Community to devise some funding to make it cleaner for you. If you got sick, your neighbors looked in on you and helped you out. You weren&#039;t left to die alone at home because your neighbors didn&#039;t even know who you were. If your laundry got lost by the laundromat&#039;s &quot;laundry lady&quot; the owner expected and got a reasonable list of the costs of the items that were lost and offered you either the cash or a free year of bi-weekly laundering. If someone was lurking around your car, a neighbor called you and the police to be sure you didn&#039;t suffer any damage. If you were standing in front of your house, a neighbor driving by would ask you were you were going and offer to drive you to the doctor 15 blocks away or to the hospital to visit your Mom in Manhattan. If the grocery bags you were schlepping seemed too heavy, someone would offer to carry them home for you. Astoria had so many local saloons where Mom and Pop could go on a Saturday night for a couple of beers just to get out of the house. If you wanted to dance or otherwise drink and do something else, you went to Manhattan. You didn&#039;t expect it to be happening around the corner from where you lived.<br /><br />I find the changes dehumanizing and extravagant. Hmmmm, perhaps I should purchase a fiddle?

				I re-read through this thread again. The last time I did so I had second thoughts about some of the comments I posted, thinking them too harsh especially about the aesthetics of Riverview East.<br /><br />It didn&#039;t fully register with me that the apartments were finally on the market, people were actually buying them and that we&#039;ll soon have some new neighbors so I should have been, and be, more neighborly.<br /><br />To the new owners: You are rightly upset about the delay in taking possession of your apartments and I hope all is resolved soon. <br /><br />But I would like you also to consider about something: do you think you&#039;re the only people who have a stake in what happens to this building? <br /><br />A bit of history: When the Met apartment complex on Ditmars went co-op in the 80s and became the Acropolis everyone when rah! rah! and hopped on the buying-mania band wagon<br /><br />Unfortunately the stock market crashed in 86, the real estate market cooled, and the Acropolis almost ended up in receivership – which would have resulted in everyone losing their shirts.<br /><br />Were it not for Queens Borough President Claire Shulman, who stepped up and negotiated a deal to save the complex everyone would have lost – I mean everyone: existing rental tenants, the new individual owners and the Ditmars community, who would have had to live with a 618-unit building cast adrift without any real management. <br /><br />http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CEEDA1E3FF935A15750C0A963958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all (http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CEEDA1E3FF935A15750C0A963958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all) <br /><br />http://cooperator.com/articles/248/1/New-Lending-Options-for-Co-ops/Page1.html (http://cooperator.com/articles/248/1/New-Lending-Options-for-Co-ops/Page1.html) <br /><br />Now here we are again. I&#039;m sorry but two, rather large apartment complexes by the same developer are entering on the cusp of a downward market (Riverview East now and Stern&#039;s warehouse, hopefully soon) with what seems like very poor management – everyone should be concerned. <br /><br />Perhaps the negativity in some of the comments stems from the fact that both buildings have been under construction for what seems like forever. I think it took less time to build the Empire State Building then it has to complete Riverview East and Sterns – which to me never seemed quite right or bode well for future residents. Is it so surprising that it also seems to be taking as long to gain possession of your apartments? <br /><br />Regardless of how I feel though, the complexes are built and it&#039;s to the benefit of the entire community that all the apartments are sold and occupied. It would be far worse for the buildings to remain half sold and potentially half empty.<br /><br />I&#039;m very sorry for any difficulty any buyers are finding themselves. I&#039;m aware it&#039;s your money on the line, but what happens in that building will affect everyone in and around it. <br />

				To: Handyman<br /><br />First of all if your intention is to be helpful, could you please post some information about your credentials/background (i.e. age, education, work experience, etc). I think everyone would like to know a little bit more about a person that makes a blanket-statement like this. <br /><br />The question you have raised is valid, but it&#039;s something that even a ten year old would have thought of. There could be many answers to that question. It is primarily dependant on the type of boiler they have installed and the buildings HVAC duct architecture/layout. I have an engineering degree (EE) as an undergrad and worked for a consulting engineering firm for a couple of years in the City - before I went back to school and changed careers. Even though I was not a mechanical engineer, this is what I recall: <br /><br />Large developments, such as this building could be designed to isolate certain sections or even control the air flow to designated areas. You can even have a duct system that can provide independent air-flow to every unit (you don’t need a boiler per apt). Usually, the main ducts are in the corridors and branch out into the units via a &#039;gate&#039; that controls the air-flow. I don’t know the specs of the installed boiler nor have I seen the duct layout, so I cannot make the statement that the boiler can operate on an approx. 25% capacity (25% occupancy ~47/188) or if the air-flow can be controlled to satisfy the initial (Phase-I) populated sections of the building. However, these are very common practices so I expect something to that extent, especially for the boiler. <br /><br />I asked Kevin regarding the heating issue a couple of months ago, when they started using the electric heaters in the sales office. I asked, how come they were not using the buildings heating units and the answer was that there &quot;has&quot; to be a minimum of units occupied to in order to operate the buildings boiler. I guess the cost of operating the boiler to its minimum capacity far exceeded the cost of the electric heaters. <br /><br />Question: &quot;Handy-man&quot; does the &quot;Handy&quot; refer to something specific? <br /><br />Next time you decide to post and raise a question (that might worry some people for no reason), it would be great if it could be accompanied with a list of possible answers or even sources (like &quot;28Grand&quot; did - Thanks for those article by the way, very informative - worth while reading) that support your argument and serve to clarify certain concerns...be informative or even be helpful aka &quot;handy&quot;<br />…otherwise you only cause static on this forum

				I would not live in either.&nbsp; The one by Astoria Park had all sorts of problems while being built, including catching fire.&nbsp; The workers were non-union, mostly day laborers, and it set time table back. I saw them building it with a friend who is in construction, and he pointed out a lot of mistakes.&nbsp; He told me 2 years ago that place would never be ready on time. <br /><br />The older buildings in Astoria are actually built better, try some of them if any are are market.&nbsp;

				I went and read through this thread, partly out of boredom and partly out of bewilderment.<br /><br />A few owners have posted over the past several months essentially hoping that they can move in &quot;soon&quot;; this was back in May, then August, October, November (which was when the FDNY gave its blessing) and now....?<br /><br />One buyer even expressed concern for the sellers&#039; &quot;inefficiency and lack of knowledge&quot; was contributing to the delay.<br /><br />From my perspective, it seems like buyers are being strung along. Maybe not. But is it normal to keep people waiting for months before they can move in?

				Thanks, Harlen, we all should think of your words the next time we squeeze onto the N train, discover the new joys of Astoria gridlock in the streets, or when the power grid fails.<br /><br />Astoria stands unique in the City of New York with a vocal minority that thinks more development is better.<br /><br />You will get what you hope for.

				We are drifting off target here (my personal fav would have been to make his buildings artist lofts/cooperatives, but something like that requires a tincture of imagination and creativity in a community whose leadership is running on autopilot)<br /><br />Take a look at the areas that are considered attractive - a nice mix without a five story monster three feet from your bedroom window and sunlight and quiet in a backyard, not some noisy human warehouse that seems to be the style in our community these days. <br /><br />Perhaps taxes can even be used, instead of helping developers, ensure we all get a steady supply of electricity, school desks for the kids, new hospitals, firehouses, more police officers, more garbage pickups - we all know the routine by now.<br /><br />Areas like downtown Flushing, or Elmhurst, are terribly overcrowded, and are not considered good places - even the immigrants that live there want to leave ASAP. They are a cautionary tale for the tear down and build set.<br /><br />Again, those that like development, like those that want to tear down Old Astoria and are against landmarking, are a small radical but very vocal element of our community. To date they refuse to share the nuggets of their &#039;wisdom&#039; outside of our community -and until they do so - perhaps we should just all tune them out. They seem to be out of step with the rest of the city.<br /><br />As to real estate prices climbing, you have infinite demand on a very finite supply. We will never get ahead of this problem as long as our country has no borders. It will get worse. A lot worse.<br /><br />Now back to Pistilli.

				Look, I am for improvement of neighborhoods, not merely increasing density with shoddy construction. Improvement means just that. More people get to live in a nicer neighborhood. <br /><br />Incidentally, I fully agree with you Gleason, that artist lofts/co-ops would have been preferable to the condos...<br /><br />A few other points... Astoria is geographically close to the largest economic engine in the US, making it an ideal place for people who work in the city to live. This is a neighborhood that <em>should </em>be denser, because it is close to good public transportation. I&#039;m very opposed to suburban sprawl for the same reason, that it&#039;s far from public transportation. (People have to live somewhere... Should it be farther out on Long Island?) <br /><br />The reason politicians support development is exactly taxes. The Pistilli building will bring in hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to the city that the abandanoned factory would not. How do you propose to pay for all the police, hospitals, schools, etc, without money coming in to the city? Raising property taxes on the existing property owners even higher? Seems like a bad idea to me, but maybe you think that&#039;s the solution...<br /><br />Flushing and Elmhurst certainly aren&#039;t ideal neighborhoods, but the problem isn&#039;t density. They&#039;re nowhere near as dense as, say, the UWS or the West Village, which are considered great places to live. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=6902.msg106106#msg106106">Quote from: Gleason on December 21, 2007, 08:18:51 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">As to real estate prices climbing, you have infinite demand on a very finite supply.

				The 26,751 p/sqm population density quote is for all of New York City, not for New York County.&nbsp; Manhattan has about 1.5 million people living in 23 square miles, which makes a population density of 66,000 p/sqm.&nbsp; Mind you, those 23 square miles includes governors island, wards/randals island, ellis island, central park, the docks and the bulkhead line and the business districts which are comparatively empty of residential development.<br /><br />When you consider the &quot;hot neighborhoods&quot; of the UES, UWS and the Village, you are easily approaching if not surpassing densities of 100,000 p/sqm.<br /><br />As for the Astoria population density quote, it does not seem correct.&nbsp; It states a population of 43,151 people and a population density of 50,455 p/sqm.&nbsp; That would breakdown to a square mileage of .85 square miles.&nbsp; This indicates to me, in particularly because Astoria has a population approaching 140,000 and much larger than .85 square miles, that the 50,455 p/sqm number is the most dense part of Astoria and does not reflect the neighborhood on the whole.&nbsp; It is most likely about only 50% to 60% of the stated number.<br /><br />Note:&nbsp; This is merely a point of clarification.&nbsp; Its an interesting debate which I am enjoying just listening to and I have not made up my mind about which way I am leaning.

They would of course be out of scale to the rest of the neigborhood but in the hands of the right developers the buildings could have been transformed into great looking, taxes generating properties that would be an asset to the neighborhood.<br /><br />My apologies to the new owners at Eagle, I don&#039;t mean to offend but in my opinion what we now have is a big disappointment -- at least looking at it from the outside. My hope is that once people move it the building will be transformed somewhat and become more alive -- fingers crossed! -- and a sincere good luck to those moving in. We need you now.<br /><br />In the case of Sterns warehouse there was a strong sentiment among residents living around it that the building should be pulled down and replaced with row houses.

The average foreclosure time in New York State is about 445 days, which puts it at #1 on the list of longest foreclosure times.&nbsp; This is about 3x (or more) longer than most of the other states that you&#039;re hearing so much about now (CA, OH, MI, FL, etc.) and it is a full 145 days longer than the 2nd longest.<br /><br />Because of this, NYS is usually much later to the party and stays much longer.<br /><br />Here&#039;s my source:http://www.mortgage-investments.com/borrow-money/foreclosure-laws.htm (http://www.mortgage-investments.com/borrow-money/foreclosure-laws.htm)<br /><br />2.&nbsp; The dollar is weak compared to the other world currencies for a multitude of reasons.&nbsp; This is bringing investors from other countries to scoop up real estate &quot;deals&quot; here in the city, as they are now at a 20-40% discount to them because the currency conversion rate is so skewed in their favor.&nbsp; Remember when the Euro was equal to the Dollar, or when you could get $1.50 Canadian dollars for $1 US?&nbsp; Not anymore.&nbsp; It&#039;s a little under $1.50 for 1 Euro and the CDN $ is about equal (at one point, it was worth MORE) than our dollar.&nbsp; So, someone that had 200,000 Euros now has about 300,000 in US dollar buying power.<br /><br />Thank you, Federal Reserve, for printing money at will, which has flooded the market with dollar bills and driven their value down in relation to the world market, which takes money out of each American&#039;s pocket (those imported goods now cost more to buy).<br /><br />But, I digress...<br /><br />3.&nbsp; Wall Street bonuses were not terrible across the board this year, but they&#039;ll very likely be down next year.&nbsp; The financial industry is probably going to take a big hit in 2008, which will bring laid off people and fewer/smaller bonuses.&nbsp; This will hurt all of those new developments and bring up foreclosures, bigtime.<br /><br />While buoyed temporarily by decent Wall Street bonuses this year and the influx of foreign cash, the NYC market will very, very, very likely come down before too long.&nbsp; Nothing is immune.&nbsp;

I think (hope) it&#039;s unlikely things will get as dreadful as they were then, but there&#039;s certainly room for things to go downhill a bit.<br /><br />As for Pistilli and other development in the area, I generally can&#039;t fathom the &quot;utter tastelessness&quot; of so much of it. Is it cutting edge and beautiful work in some other country and being American I just don&#039;t &quot;get it&quot;? Or is it an elaborate strategy to shape the neighborhood population by making things so damn ugly certain groups who value appearances won&#039;t consider moving here? Is it just super-cheap to build ugly? <br /><br />Handling a conversion like Eagle was (visually from the outside at least) makes me think it must have been a clear decision to not follow the approach taken with that type of conversion in just about every city in the US. I can&#039;t help but wonder if that&#039;s a cultural difference or something, based on cultural perceptions and feelings about &quot;factories&quot; and the like. Or maybe someone just has bad taste and/or hired a bad architect. In fairness there are terribly ugly dev/re-dev all over the more popular/&quot;hot&quot; boroughs as well...

				There is only one reason that the Pistilli developments are so utterly unattractive - the owners have bad taste and the architect is extremely provincial (or the opposite of what a visionary is).&nbsp; I have met Joseph Pistilli and he is a nice man, but I think that most of his life was spent on this side of the river and although he has lots of money, I am not sure that he has travelled much or has much imagination.&nbsp; Sorry, but the buildings are a dissapointment.&nbsp; In spite of this, I am looking forward to seeing people move in and perhaps make improvements.

I remember it well. The boom and bust of the 1980&#039;s and early 1990&#039;s was created by a confluence of factors. Changes in the tax code spurred a speculative building boom in New York, which led to a glut of apartments on the market. Then, in October 1987, the stock market collapsed, rocking consumer confidence and wounding the city&#039;s economic base. Finally, the crisis in the savings and loan industry led to a tightening of lending requirements that greatly restricted the availability of loans. But it&#039;s a different city now, and the fact that crime is lower makes a difference. Plus there are far more foreign investors buying here than ever before. <br />&nbsp; But, to say that Astoria will never have a &quot;low demand &quot; for housing, just because it is &quot;20 minutes from Manhattan&quot; is utterly ridiculous. It has happened before and it is happening again. Look at what&#039;s&nbsp; happening in Miami, which up until a few months ago had a booming condo market. Well, ok the builders might think that the market is still booming, but it is definitely a buyers market, as people are unable to offload what they bought thinking it was a good deal at the time. Do some research next time.

				Well, my neighbor who purchased an apartment there just had his closing delayed yet again - <br />I think this might be about or near the tenth time. <br /><br />It was set for mid-January and was pushed back to February 9th. Luckily our buildiing is owned<br />by Pistilli, so he didn&#039;t need to give up his place.<br /><br />But I still think that for the price he paid - which I believe was between $500K - 600K - he could have<br />done better than that place and with a lot less hassle. <br /><br />This isn&#039;t said with jealousy or sour grapes. Being a Pistilli tenant, I truly wish everyone who<br />moves in there the best of luck and hope it was worth all this waiting.<br />

				When you criticize the aesthetics of the Eagle building , in essence you are judging all of Astoria - correct? I personally can&#039;t differentiate the two. The only reason that the Pistilli developments are so utterly unattractive is to fit in, both aesthetically and architecturally, with the rest of Astoria. Could someone elaborate what your benchmark is when you judge a building on how it looks? Please give me an address and so I can drive by there… Please don’t even mention Astoria Towers, a 20-25 year old building with their 6&#039; ceiling apartments that has the feeling of a grave and that go for 900$/sq-ft. <br />I&#039;ve been living in Astoria for the past 6 years and I would describe the average house in Astoria as a semi-attached, wooden-framed, 2 family house that is approx 50-60 years old, which is literally rotting and slowly falling apart. The main thing that Astoria has to offer to newcomers is its geographical location. Astoria is so densely populated, not for its great &quot;neighborhood&quot; nor its beautiful buildings, but because of the convenient commute to the city and its ethnic diversity. I&#039;ve had many friends from Europe visit Astoria….people with different backgrounds, ethnicities and social status (white, blue, red, yellow and purple collar people) and they all had the same opinion - that they were visiting a third world country. Thank God the City was close, so they left with a good impression at the end. You don&#039;t need to travel that far to become objective with what is beautiful. You just need to cross the Atlantic ocean - that&#039;s all. But then again - I don&#039;t think any of us has chosen to live in Astoria because of its beauty - we all have our personal reasons. <br />Very few buildings and neighborhoods get a passing grade in Astoria. Perhaps, 19th street is one of those… and that&#039;s only because of the &quot;park,&quot; which acts as some sort of an asylum and refuge from the rest of Astoria. However, any brand new development/conversion gets some sort of extra credit in my opinion, which makes it at least above the average. <br />Before people start commenting on how ugly any building is in Astoria, first take a look around you and then recalibrate your measurements of judgment...before this forum really starts to get ridiculous. Where do you live? <br />I take the Triboro every day…and my observation is a little more broader than yours Handyman, I look at Astoria as a whole…it reminds me of some documentaries they show for Kazakhstan....I can see the cruise ship metaphor, but I also see hundred of other smaller ships buried - a grave-yard of buried ships! <br />If there was a unit of repulsiveness, per unit the Eagle building is equally ugly to any other in Astoria. It&#039;s just much bigger, so it seems uglier as it sticks out to the human eye

				As an owner at Pistilli Riverview East how much longer are our neighbors going to complain about the building? Not to sound rude but reality is that the building is open and functioning. We are now part of the community. So to those members that like to peck away at everything relating to this property, can you show some respect since it is our new home?

				Used to travel all over the U.S. - some cities were so horrific that the best thing about visiting them was getting out!&nbsp; If you want beauty, you should live in Paris (although there are some very unsightly neighborhoods just on the outskirts) or Vienna.&nbsp; Astoria seemed beautiful at one time, if you look at 100 year old photos, but then was ruined by urban sprawl and the attraction of being close to Manhattan.&nbsp; It is what it is folks!&nbsp; Those that like it can stay, and those that don&#039;t can move on to more beautiful pastures!<br /><br />By the way, it is the people who make Astoria beautiful.

				I think we can all agree that we are all going to have different views on the buildings appearance-I personally think it&#039;s cool looking. I&#039;ve lived in Astoria all my life and have always loved the old eagle plant and am so happy that it will be preserved. My husband and I loved the interior of the building as well, the apartments are unbelievable-yes, the fixtures are cheap but you are paying below market value for an enormous space, the fixtures can be replaced! Congratulations to everyone who was able to purchase there! :-)

				This is a condo complex. The common charges are high but that includes the RE taxes-they have applied for a tax abatement but it hasn&#039;t come through yet. I imagine once it is approved the CC will be half, as it stands right now it&#039;s about $1 a SF.

				Hello, I am new to this board and wanted to introduce myself.&nbsp; I have been renting in Astoria (really upper Ditmars) for the past 2 1/2 years and am currently in the market to buy something.&nbsp; However, because I seem to work all of the time, I really am not that interested in buying a single family home and be saddled with the upkeep and other headaches that come with it (for that matter, a 2-family with the prospect of a renter seems even more daunting). As such, I would prefer to buy in a new development somewhere in Astoria that will require little, if any, work at the outset.&nbsp; Specifically, I was wondering if people on this board have been to the open houses at the Pistilli Grand Manor on Ditmars (I think the cross street is 45th st).&nbsp; I have visited and have some mixed feelings.&nbsp; I really like that area of Astoria and the square footage in the condos is great, but I&#039;m concerned about the (very) high monthly maintenance fees.&nbsp; My overall first impression, however, was favorable (if you can get over the combined costs of maintenance and parking along with a mortgage, which I don&#039;t know if I can yet).&nbsp; <br /><br />I was wonder if others on this board have taken a look at the apartments and, if so, what their general impressions were?&nbsp; Secondly, I was wondering if others on the board have &quot;heard&quot; anything negative (or positive for that matter) about this building?&nbsp; <br /><br />I was hoping this post could serve as a new thread on the topic of the Grand Manor.<br /><br />Thanks.

				I went to the Grand Manor open house on Saturday 3/1.&nbsp; <br />on the plus side, I too like the area, the rooms are HUGE and your maintenance covers the central heat &amp; a/c, doorman and porter.<br /><br />Now, the minus side.&nbsp; The material used looks cheap and the fridge and stove are bottom on the line. Prices are based on square footage, so because the room are so big, most 1 bedrooms are around $380,000 and maintenance is around $800 per month (again, depending on the square footage.)&nbsp; &nbsp;Also, there are parking spots but those are an additional $185 per month.<br /><br />All in all....the prices are much too expensive for what you&#039;re getting.<br /><br />Hope that helps, and good luck.

				Flikchik- Thanks for the reply.<br /><br />Do you know of any other new Condos or Co-ops in the area that are of similar sizes?&nbsp; What would you use as a comparable - something that is of comparable size and better priced?&nbsp; I haven&#039;t been able to find anything.&nbsp; I too think the units at the Grand Manor are very expensive, but there is almost nothing specific to compare those units to, other than the Pistilli Riverview (which, for me is out of the question considering the sponsor does not actually own the land).&nbsp; Acropolis units seem older and smaller to me and Shore Towers really isn&#039;t the same area (and, while the building is nice enough, the units are certainly smaller than the Grand Manor and sell for similar prices).&nbsp; There just doesn&#039;t seem to be very much else.<br /><br />Anyone else have any thoughts on the Grand Manor or other developments in upper astoria?

				I totally agree with you.....I&#039;ve been looking for a condo in Astoria and it seems it&#039;s a buyers market everywhere except Astoria.&nbsp; I did go to an open house for a new condo that was built on 12th Street and 27th Avenue.&nbsp; The &quot;model&quot; apartment was a 2 bedroom/2bath apartment.&nbsp; The rooms were small but there was a nice view of the city.....which must be why they&#039;re asking $556,000!&nbsp; The 1 bedrooms were around $350,000......but the problem is that there is absolutely no parking and the train station is rather far.<br /><br />Check on Craigslist......there are listings in there, but again, everything seems very pricey.

				I was at the open house. &nbsp;I&#039;m not an expert on kitchens and appliances, but there are nice, modern, stainless steel appliances and cabinets...and there&#039;s what&#039;s in the ditmars condo - &nbsp;they&#039;re the kind that you DEAL WITH when you&#039;re a college kid getting you&#039;re first apartment. &nbsp;The stove was the kind from 1970 with no clock. &nbsp;You can find modern stuff in little studio apartments around here for that matter. &nbsp;I mean, this is an investment of hundreds of thousands of dollars, in a brand new building that&#039;s immaculate on the outside, and the inside doesn&#039;t match the splendor...AT ALL. &nbsp;Especially for their abnormally high asking price and maintenance, you should get the best. &nbsp;As far as upper ditmars, all the luxury condos seem to be going up in L.I.C. &nbsp;We looked at one on the water where the appliances, the cabinets, the wall sockets, bathroom fixtures were what you&#039;d find in a luxury hotel. &nbsp;And of course, I&#039;m not suggesting Brooklyn when you&#039;re talking about upper ditmars, but my point is, there&#039;s a new condo there with amazing bathrooms, a huge kitchen island...outstanding.<br />They&#039;ve been building that thing for a long time, and there was a big anticipation. &nbsp;I&#039;ve heard from 5 or 6 people who went to the open house and they were disappointed. &nbsp;I&#039;ve heard people who heard people were disappointed. &nbsp;Even the people at he walk-thru appeared un-impressed. &nbsp;It even seemed that the layout in some of the bigger condos had the odder kitchen layout, very narrow where the door of the fridge nearly hits the oven across from it - not the type of awkwardness you expect from a condo. &nbsp;But at the end of the day, you have to formulate an opinion by seeing the place doing what makes you happy.

				I went for a viewing on these condos. They weren&#039;t bad. I agree that the kitchens do not have the best appliances, but that&#039;s something that can be easily changed. As far as the maintenance is concerned, it actually is not that high, considering that the taxes are included as well as heat and air conditioning, plus a door man, laundry, and gym facilities. The maintenance at the Acropolis is just a little cheaper for a way smaller apartment with less amenities. <br /><br />This neighborhood (Ditmars area) is really tough to buy in. It&#039;s either a co-op or condo for around 300k (and up) or to buy a house for a minimum of 700k (and up). There is not a lot of selection.

				Our guide was telling everyone that the studios were in the mid 300k range and the 2 brs were in the 6s and 7s depending on the layout - there were many different ones, 1BR w two bath, 2BR with one or two bath, etc. &nbsp;For a studio 300K is a lot, the good news is, if you&#039;re only paying maintenance for square footage, you won&#039;t have to pay as much as the condos with a bedroom.

				You know, I really wish more builders would offer buyers a choice of finishes.&nbsp; What I mean is they price the raw space at a certain amount.&nbsp; Say $300,000.&nbsp; Then offer the buyer plan A, B, or C.&nbsp; Plan A might be the economy finishes (floors, cabinets, appliances, fixtures) and would add maybe $20,000.&nbsp; And Plan C would be the high end like the Sub Zero, the Viking Range, etc and maybe add $50,000.&nbsp; I realize it can be labor intensive and can create some confusion.&nbsp; But the builder usually orders and pays in bulk for all three categories and can pretty much quickly transform each unit accordingly.&nbsp; Then the buyer gets what they like and what they can afford.&nbsp; This is very common in suburban housing developments.&nbsp; I think the reason Pistilli tends to offend a lot of people is that he seems to push out the lowest quality possible in order to make the highest profit.&nbsp; So the happiness of the buyer is not even part of the equation.&nbsp; That&#039;s not a very nice feeling for a new homeowner to have.&nbsp;

				I personally think people just pick on the Pistilli Buildings because he ended the fun for all the landlords who have been hiking up rental apartments in Astoria for so many years, which yes, that I agree are completelly overpriced. People are paying rediculous amounts for tiny places with no closets!!! Therefore, I agree with the comments of some folks, you are much better off buying your own place, and if this is what you can afford then be it... better than renting... plus if they are so picky about the quality of certain things, they should go spend their millions in Manhattan... give people a break... like older buildings don&#039;t have mice running around them! Haha...

It&#039;s quite a risky buy, not because of the 22 mil debt, whic now is about 18 mil. First of all, the building owes this much, not Pistilli himself... The reason why is because the Coop (which is in fact a corporation) took an underlying mortgage of 20 something Mil when it was first created to build the building. This cost is included in the monthly maintnance payments, which explains why maintnance is so so HIGH!!! The way they catch you is because they say MAYBE, in 3 years, the building MIGHT become a Condo, IF the Board votes for it... yada yada, then they say the value MIGHT go up... oh I was almost forgeting, this building does NOT own the land where it stands, therefore, they also tell you IF the bldg becomes a Coop, the Sponsor MIGHT purchase the land and he MIGHT give the Coop its right to the land... The bottom line, I don&#039;t think you should buy into it unless you know for a fact that you have the stomack to go through this transition in 3 years or so, and&nbsp; you should probably wait that long, otherwise, I don&#039;t think it would be worth the investment. But if you are in it for the long term, I think you have good chances of making a good deal... we did not go for it cause we are a young couple considering moving away, so it just wasn&#039;t the right place for us, but wish everyone luck who are considering it. I just think you should negotiate really well because it seems they were having a tough time selling it, not sure that&#039;s still the case today. We looked back in Jan&#039;08.

				It could be that buyers bought the units as an investment opportunity and are now renting out the unit they bought, instead of moving in themselves.&nbsp; Or that Pistilli is having trouble finding buyers, and is now renting units to make up for it.&nbsp;

				All the buyers I know are living in their apartments, including me. As for information concerning renting an apartment, the Sales office on the premise is for potential buyers only. You would need to contact the real estate agency that is handling the rent units. The Sales office is not associated with the Real Estate broker. I believe the Craiglist link that Angastoria posted last week should have be the realtor&#039;s information.<br />

				I went to the open house a couple of weeks ago and we are really considering buying.&nbsp; It&#039;s almost double the amount of space we have today.&nbsp; Of course taking into consideration the maintenance, it&#039;s also more than double the rent.&nbsp; Since I am a first time home buyer I&#039;m gonna have to read up on tax exemption before we schedule our second visit, so I can ask them why is this building not exempt.<br /><br />Finishes are definitely cheap, but we figure (hope) we can always update in the future and right now our rental has a 70&#039;s refrigerator that is killing my electric bill, so anything is an improvement, really.<br /><br />I saw a similarly priced in a less than desirable Manhattan neighborhood and it was tiny. Not to mention the gang-looking kids in the corner did not look friendly at all!&nbsp; I really want to stop renting and with a big efforts we might be able to afford this, so I guess I&#039;m willing to re-decorate b4 we move in.<br /><br />

				Hey Krocker,<br /><br />Good news and thanks for the inside scoop!&nbsp; You can&#039;t blame your neighbors for not having the &quot;facts&quot;.&nbsp; You must admit - what we all witnessed with this building has been one fumble after the next.&nbsp; And the builder did nothing to explain to the surrounding community what was happening.&nbsp; Here nor up on Ditmars.&nbsp; But I must say, the delays and problems with this building do seem extraordinary compared to any other construction site most of us have seen.&nbsp; And it seems like Pistilli has an overall unsavory reputation.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s good they&#039;re capping the renters percentage.&nbsp; And it sounds like you will form a board that will do the right thing.&nbsp; Especially if you can limit the voting power of an off-site sponsor.&nbsp; Maybe these problems will serve you well in the end.&nbsp; Most new coop and condo boards are clueless and make terrible mistakes.&nbsp; My guess is that you guys will be sharp from the get go and second guess everything.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think I disagree about the luxury thing.&nbsp; You have a doorman, security, receipt of packages, secure parking, maybe a gym?&nbsp; And a hefty maintenance fee.&nbsp; I think that would qualify as luxury.&nbsp; No, not like Williamsburg or the LIC waterfront, but that&#039;s totally due to location.&nbsp; The Astoria waterfront is coming along in due time.<br /><br />I guess I just want to be clear that I&#039;m thrilled that you and other owners and tenants are happy there.&nbsp; I walked by the other night and was so happy to see lights lit and people decorating.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think anyone on this board has any ill wishes towards the folks who bought here.&nbsp; In fact, quite the opposite.&nbsp; I think people worried about cut corners and a disregard for - and disrespect to - the future buyers/tenants and the nearby community.&nbsp; No one wants to see a bunch of people purchase property in our neighborhood and then have problems - financial or otherwise.&nbsp; <br /><br />I hope you guys all settle in and take over the operations of your building and become a vibrant part of the community.&nbsp; That you enjoy the park and all the great restaurants and shopping in our area.&nbsp; &nbsp;:mrgreen:

				I am so confused!&nbsp; It is like your in-laws telling you that you&#039;ve made the wrong investment after you&#039;ve already moved in and love it!&nbsp; Are we going to be hearing these criticisms over and over again?&nbsp; Can you folks please call the Joseph Pistilli and complain to him directly?&nbsp; <br /><br />Joseph - you have bad taste.&nbsp; You could have done something spectacular with this building but did a shoddy job using cheap materials.&nbsp; You took too long to build it and now the real estate market is down and you will have trouble selling those apartments.&nbsp; Your layouts do not make sense.&nbsp; The appliances are mediocre.&nbsp; The lighting is wierd.&nbsp; And, what are you doing mentioning salami on your website?

				Debbie, I totally agree with you. I am confused too however the woodpeckers of this thread will still continue to peck away at the building even after we are living there and are part of the community. It is obvious that there are still ill feelings toward this property. And all please spear us the reasons toward the ill feelings, we have heard/read them before. Now I await the negative nods to this posting.&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				Any idea what sort of apartments are still available for sale and what the asking price is? Not asking what anybody actually paid (though that sort of information is usually publicly available if you do a lot of digging), just what they are asking?&nbsp; 2BR and 3BR apartments in particular.

				If these are the Pistilli apartments by Astoria Park, the front stairs are already cracking, the cement and bricks all around front need repair, and mold is forming by bottom of store/office space area where building meets the ground.&nbsp; Also I looked at store site, they have leaks already--bad leaks. That whole sheetrock in store may have to be taken down, and ceiling repaired.&nbsp; I passed by for&nbsp; a look last week, on 21 street side.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />If you are talking about another development by same builder,&nbsp; my mistake.

				This is for the new astorians: congratulations on your purchase! I love the building, think it has a great view and fantastic location. I believe the investment will appreciate considerably. It was very exciting to watch an abandoned factory where we were malcreants as kids get repurposed.<br /><br />This is for the lifers: do you believe they made a multiple felon the foreman of that construction project? c&#039;mon, we all know him- he got by by cutting corners back then- does that habit change?<br /><br />And for the litigious: if it doesn&#039;t work out, due to aforementioned <strong>alleged </strong>corner cutting, you always have construction defect litigation to fall back on...<br /><br />

				Triboro man: sorry to hear about your situation with J. Pistilli. I wish you all the luck.<br /><br />As for Cable/Internet access, the building has been set up and Time Warner Cable came to my apartment today, hence this posting from the comfort of my bed. As for complaints from inside the building, I agree with Krocker, nothing major that can&#039;t be fixed. The super who runs the place is amazing. Moreover, lets all keep in mind an investment, nor matter where it is, is not for everyone for x and y reasons. I too almost backed out of this investment due to the delays in closing/moving in. <br /><br />

				I have to say, I am fascinated by this thread. When my girlfriend and I were looking at apartments to rent back in February we looked at the Pistilli building and fell in love immediately. I decided it would be smart to google the building and see what I could find before I went through with it, and we saw nothing but bad news, mostly on this thread. <br /><br />We backed out, and I am perfectly happy where we are now. Our place is much smaller than the Pistilli place, but we have a big outdoor patio, an amazing location right off 21 Ave near the Subway, and a wonderful landlord. However, I still wonder what if? What if we had moved into the Pistilli building? I will say Id be furious without Internet or Cable, but I did love the building.<br /><br />I wish all of you who moved in the best, and look forward to more arguing/commenting on this discussion thread.<br /><br />-Andrew

				Just as a comparison, there are a couple of 2 story, 2 bedroom (with a basement with a bathroom that can be converted into a &quot;rental&quot;--it&#039;s technically not legal but quite a few rent them as studios for as much as $700-- or more bedrooms) HOUSES on our street (28th and 21st Avenue) that sell for $590K.&nbsp; We are closer to the train.&nbsp; I guess I thought I would expect to pay less for a condo than a house with a yard.

				My husband and I live just around the corner from this place and have been watching the incredibly shoddy construction for a long time now. Now they&#039;ve glued the molding back on where it&#039;s fallen off and are open for business! So, for giggles, we went to an open house and were not surprised to find holes in the walls, mullions not properly installed in the windows, flooring improperly laid, poor kitchen space, etc. I&#039;m a petite woman, and some of the bathrooms I was hitting my shoulder on one side of the door frame and my purse on the other when I tried to walk in. Some of my more muscular friends would have to turn sideways to fit through a door that small. One of the units even had the balcony built off of the bathroom. As for the kitchen cabinets- they&#039;re like the kind I had in college where the doors would fall off at random moments. Of course, you get a scenic view of either the gas station and meat processing plant or the strip mall! Trust me, if you live here you are going to have problems. The group I viewed them with were all pretty amused with what they were trying to sell. I think the poor woman showing them was nearing the end of her rope. I&#039;m sure you can do better!

				I haven&#039;t logged on in a while...I just want to check on how everyone who bought/rented is doing.&nbsp; We love being in the building despite &quot;growing pains&quot; the building is going through.&nbsp; We bought our unit knowing we had to do renovations.&nbsp; I&#039;ve read in other threads that this shouldn&#039;t have to be the case.&nbsp; Honestly I wish we don&#039;t have to and just move into a perfect apartment.&nbsp; The reality is the &quot;perfect ones&quot; that we&#039;ve looked at are usually unaffordable (&gt; 600K).&nbsp; It&#039;s been a real sacrifice these past couple of months going through renovating our living room and kitchen (mostly the kitchen).&nbsp; Our living room is finally done for the most part...the kitchen should be done next Saturday.&nbsp; Over the next months we will be doing smaller renovations.<br /><br />Here&#039;s how the living room looked before:<br /><br />(http://img168.imageshack.us/img168/1662/2356223512ff1cb3cebdbff6.th.jpg) (http://img168.imageshack.us/my.php?image=2356223512ff1cb3cebdbff6.jpg)<br /><br />Here&#039;s how it looks today with the renovation:<br /><br />(http://img515.imageshack.us/img515/5015/26479138430d46f223afbyb6.th.jpg) (http://img515.imageshack.us/my.php?image=26479138430d46f223afbyb6.jpg)<br /><br />(http://img170.imageshack.us/img170/5479/264874810208fa5c4eaebvv7.th.jpg) (http://img170.imageshack.us/my.php?image=264874810208fa5c4eaebvv7.jpg)<br /><br />When completed our kitchen will be much bigger (at least 2x the square footage, counter space, and storage...yes the original design was that bad).&nbsp; We enjoy being here.&nbsp; I really like the fact that it&#039;s next to the park (one of the main reasons why we bought here).&nbsp; It&#039;s nice to walk down to the pool in the morning to do laps or cool off when the it gets hot.&nbsp; It was a treat to watch the 4th of July fireworks from the rooftop (albeit rainy night).&nbsp; It would be nice to have a meet and greet sometime this summer with others who live in the building.

				It is pretty cool to have the entire 5th floor to myself though.<br /><br />My girlfriend and I moved in in April, and aside from the poopie floor and kitchen, it&#039;s pretty cool. I accepted the fact long ago that they have no idea how to construct a decent looking building. I love the front water fountain. Nice touch with the blue tiles and the copper birds. Very classy.<br /><br />Still, the space for the price is the best in the area for a new building. They are pretty quick to fix issues aswell. <br /><br />Plus going into random empty apartments with all your friends, drinking, and using the hot tubs is pretty fun.

				Great!&nbsp; Then tell me more about that brick.&nbsp; I was looking at some faux stone wall treatments that are very popular now. We saw a display at the recent International Design Expo.&nbsp; These are man-made materials and are either interlocking or applied with an adhesive.&nbsp; The main advantage is that there is practically no mess to the room.&nbsp; See this photo to get an idea of the product.&nbsp; Also, if you ever eat in Luna De Juarez on Steinway (great food), you will see they used almost an overabundance of this material.&nbsp; I ask because we are at a pretty final stage now and we cannot bring in buckets of wet mortar.&nbsp; So I&#039;m always interested in materials that can have the smallest impact on the rest of the apartment.&nbsp; But I would definitely consider the bricks you used for the next apartment we buy.&nbsp; <br /><br />(http://www.culturedstone.com/photos/large/interior/architkhsint85.jpg)

				The bricks are real bricks...the same dimensions as a normal brick, just thinner..about 1/2&quot; thick.&nbsp; It&#039;s attached to the wall using mortar (first treating the wall behind it as I described previously).&nbsp; It does get messy when the brick is cut...most of the cutting was done on the terrace...but we had to cut some details after the brick was up so that created a lot of dust in the living room.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m not familiar with any faux stones so I can&#039;t speak about them.&nbsp; It looks nice on the photo, but you can&#039;t really judge something like this based on a picture.&nbsp; I really wanted something that looks and feel like a real brick wall.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen faux brick walls before and wasn&#039;t happy with how they looked.&nbsp; It was actually at a design show where I first saw these bricks and gave me some confidence on installing them.&nbsp; I was surprised that these things actually existed.&nbsp; I suggest going to the place where we bought the materials from:<br /><br />Extech Industries 43-87 Vernon Blvd. Long Island City, NY 11101 718-786-2288<br /><br />You might get more ideas from them...plus its fun if you like renovating&nbsp; :-).<br />

				It&#039;s a very interesting product, these thin bricks.&nbsp; But they do seem to require a similar installation to a traditional brick wall in terms of the wall prep and the actual &quot;brick laying&quot; with the mortar and the whole nine yards.&nbsp; I&#039;m old enough to remember the awful faux brick of the 70s that was all the rage.&nbsp; Like the expression goes, it&#039;s come a LONG way since then.&nbsp; The stones like in my photo are a dead ringer for real stone when you see them in person.&nbsp; And surprisingly, even to the touch.&nbsp; The only real sign is if you knock on it, you will hear the hollow echo and a vinyl/plastic tone.&nbsp; Our personal issue is that we spent the past couple of years doing both heavy and light renovations to every room in our apartment.&nbsp; We&#039;re finally at the stage of decorating elements such as final choices in furnishings, lighting, art, etc.&nbsp; So bringing in a brick layer at this point is just not happening for us.&nbsp; It&#039;s easier to move!&nbsp; So when we saw the guys at the trade show with this artificial product, it was interesting.&nbsp; The material is made by Owens Corning (and competitors, of course).&nbsp; You basically use an adhesive like Loctite in a caulking gun on the wall.&nbsp; Then stack these &quot;blocks&quot; of stone on the wall like a puzzle.&nbsp; No prep.&nbsp; Just a drop cloth underneath in case of an accident.&nbsp; They even cut with a heavy duty shears.&nbsp; (Oh how I remember the wet saw on the terrace.&nbsp; And the chalky splatter of granite dust all over our windows)&nbsp; Anyway - that&#039;s it - pretty simple.&nbsp; What&#039;s held us back is the concern that in ten years, it might scream 2008.&nbsp; In other words, your job is real brick and looks like plain brick - it&#039;s timeless.&nbsp; This fake stuff looks nice now but it could turn off a buyer down the road and that&#039;s not a good thing.&nbsp; I love experimenting with unusual paint techniques and doing accent walls.&nbsp; I may stick to that.&nbsp; If it&#039;s not someones taste - or if we tire of it - just get a gallon of paint and go over it.

			<dd class="postbody">
				Whenever something big goes up in Astoria, and I mean BIG, I always hear two names: Pistilli and HANAC.<br /><br />The motivation of Pistilli, a private developer, is pretty clear. But what exactly is HANAC? What is the criteria used in selecting residents for these housing projects? Does it give any preference to seniors of Greek descent? Or is based purely on economic need?

				I know nothing about HANAC.&nbsp; To my mind, housing is housing. As an outsider who didn&#039;t grow up here, the perennial Irish/German/Italian/Greek &quot;you people take all the goodies&quot; stuff just doesn&#039;t resonate.<br /><br />I was raised Presbyterian, so I would rather that Scottish widows had preference.<br /><br />As I understand it, the Sterns warehouse at 45th and Ditmars was considered for affordable senior housing. Then it was to be 20% senior housing and 80% condos, and on that understanding, the residential zoning was approved. The original developer died. Pistilli Group took on the property. They decided not to be bound by the deal that the former developer had made.<br /><br />To jog my memory, I found this Queens Gazette article from Feb 2003 (http://www.qgazette.com/News/2003/0507/Front_page/001.html) and another from May 2003 (http://www.qgazette.com/News/2003/0507/Front_page/001.html)<br /><br />(A bonus feature of the second article is a picture that some may want to use as a dartboard.)<br /><br />This project may be different, in that there is actual money that will (presumably) go away if the purpose changes. But that public money could be a drop-in-the-bucket compared to the opportunity for condo development.<br /><br />I don&#039;t like the size of the proposed building, and I hate to see the picturesque, if somewhat crumbling, old edifice go. But I&#039;ve lived in the neighborhood for 28 years and I never set foot in that church. To be all indignant now, I&#039;d feel a hypocrite.<br /><br />Anyway, it will be fun to watch what trajectory this new project will take. (Fun in the sense of watching mischief that mostly involves other peoples&#039; material interest.)<br />

				I&#039;ve lived in the Astoria area my entire life and currently work in the real estate investment properties and construction.<br /><br />Like many, I was excited about this project even before Pistilli was the owner and bought the rights to the building after the prior realtor died.&nbsp; I kept a close eye on this property because it seemed like it would be a great investment, and possibly a place where my son or daughters could live in the future if I bought property there at the beginning.&nbsp; That was 5 years ago and now that they&#039;re old enough to be on their own.<br /><br />However, when I went on their &quot;tours&quot; and visited their open house, including additional visits by appointment, I can only say I was utterly disappointed.&nbsp; The place had enormous potential, but the number of mistakes I found with the property was astounding and I&#039;ve taken a pass on investing in the building.<br /><br />For starters, the quality of the construction was poor.&nbsp; It&#039;s to the point that they&#039;re just covering up mistakes instead of fixing them, including water damaged ceilings, eroding floors, wood laminate passed off as wood floors, numerous soft spots in the floors which will only lead to sagging floors, to broken window fixtures and springs that already need to be replaced before people even move in.&nbsp; Paint was chipped in the model rooms, as well as damage to walls and fixtures before a person has even moved in.<br /><br />The layouts of the units are terrible.&nbsp; One thing they teach designers and architects immediately is not to waste space.&nbsp; The majority of the units have terribly wasted space including semi walk-in closets that aren&#039;t true walk in closets, long corridors to bathrooms, obstructed angles to bathrooms, uneven ceiling levels preventing anyone from hanging light fixtures or ceiling fans, on top of odd corners and nooks that can only fit decorations or small furnishings.&nbsp; The space of the units is large enough that these spaces could have been utilized more efficiently.<br /><br />The appliances are regular day bargain basement items you find at Home Depot.&nbsp; When building a multiple dwelling building, the ideal is to save money on appliances by getting them in bulk.&nbsp; Having accounts with Home Depot, Lowe&#039;s and other retailers allows you the ability to get quality materials for cheaper prices.&nbsp; Considering Pistilli needed 200 appliances minimum, he could have even gotten great contractor deals directly from manufacturers (instead of third party retailers like Home Depot).&nbsp; But Pistilli took the cheap route and installed all low end products.&nbsp; Every stove, dishwasher, toilet, sink, bath tub, shower head, refrigeration unit and microwave he installed can be found at Home Depot, and marketed towards the middle income class families (I checked this on my own).&nbsp; The &quot;stainless steel&quot; products are faux stainless steel... a great seller&#039;s tool that people will not notice on first walkthroughs.&nbsp; The product is a metallic tape, permanently sealed to a plastic fridge to give the appeal of stainless steel.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t scrape or tear like normal tape, but will wear and tear over the years.&nbsp; It&#039;s an extraordinarily cheaper solution to stainless steel than actually getting stainless steal products.&nbsp; To add value to your condo, these products should be replaced immediately, which will cost you upfront money.<br /><br />My final concern is the price.&nbsp; Unfortunately, there is no true competitor in his market.&nbsp; Pistilli Grand Manor does not have a single condo competitor within a 10 block radius, and the closest 3 markets are Garden Bay Condos, Barclay Gardens and Shore Towers Condos... each offering completely different amenities and values for buyers.&nbsp; His pricing of ~$1 PSF is slightly pricey, but again, there is no true competitor to challenge his price.&nbsp; The average asking price of $400K for $500 PSF is also relatively high compared to 3 aforementioned condos.&nbsp; The only difference is the GB, BG &amp; ST have more to offer than just a 200 unit building with a garage (where you still rent a space).&nbsp; ST offers views of Manhattan, tennis courts, balconies and other high end amenities.&nbsp; GB &amp; BG offer homestyle ownership of a condo, with outdoor patios, grassy backyards and a limited number of neighbors, thus their pricing plateau is $150K lower on average, offering a much more cost efficient alternative.<br /><br />I strongly believe this property could have been worth this asking price of $500 PSF, had the conditions been right.&nbsp; The appliances, the construction, the layouts and amenities should have been top notch to ask for $500 PSF, but they fell below average expectations and underwhelmed at best.&nbsp; Though his prices are negotiable, it seems the money he is willing to lose on payment for the unit, will have to be reinvested by the buyer back into the property to make it enjoyable.&nbsp; Thus, purchasers will be saving on the signing price, but paying for personal renovations and upgrades to make the space their own, and make the unit more profitable in maintenance costs in the future for Pistilli.<br /><br />As a realtor, an investor, a prospective buyer and a father, I would strongly recommend anyone interested in this property to do their research into alternative purchases.&nbsp; The money you spend buying a unit here might be better spent at another condo like Garden Bay or Barclay Gardens.&nbsp; Or, you can always wait for Pistilli&#039;s next project, which will be built diagonally across from his current building since he bought the retail space that has Astoria Bakery, the cleaners and brick oven pizza restaurant.&nbsp; When their leases expire, he will raze that space to build another condo unit.&nbsp; The last lease belongs to Astoria Bakery which will expire in 2009.

				I belonged to the gym across the street from this building.&nbsp; Most of the people who worked across the street went and checked out the apartments.&nbsp; No one thought they were well made.<br /><br />If you really want a Condo and not a co-op, have you checked out the pre-war building in Jackson Heights that&#039;s been converted to a condominium?&nbsp; Stratford Hall on 35th Ave. at 80th Street.&nbsp; I have friends looking to buy in the building.&nbsp; They liked the apartments they saw there.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t had time to look inside but the building looks nice from the street and the location is great.&nbsp; &nbsp;I read that the building has 1, 2 and 3 bedroom apartments.<br /><br />You might want to check out other buildings before committing to one on Ditmars.&nbsp; Then you&#039;ll have some other comparisons to help you make a decision.&nbsp; I found this link online and it has photos of an apartment there with prices listed.&nbsp;You&#039;ll have to click on View Listings and scroll down till you find Stratford Hall to see the photos.&nbsp; This will give you an idea of what&#039;s out there as far as size and prize although this particular apt. looks like someone made an offer.&nbsp; but it&#039;ll give you something to compare:<br /><br />http://www.jacksonheightsproperties.com/agent/listings2.phplisting=71b308388e79bd18aaa0ae2e66766f54&amp;username=vsimkhov<br />

				Last Saturday I went to the Pistilli apartments on 21st Street for the 2nd time in 2 years.<br />At first appearances things looked well enough - until the realtor began taking me into the apartments for sale - and I notices multiple apartments with water damage in the ceilings (that they tried to cover up) and damaged floors. <br />To me, the biggest reason I would never buy an apartment there is that Pistilli does not own the land, they lease it - which is why the prices and maintenance are so high.&nbsp; Stay far far away!

				When I went to the open house at Pistilli I wasn&#039;t worried about the appliances that much.&nbsp; What concerned me most was the lousy floors and the way the wood seemed to warp in areas.&nbsp; Appliances and cabinets can be switched, according to the agent you can negotiate it with the purchase price, so if you want Sub-Zero appliances and Mahogany cabinets with a marble countertop you can get it.&nbsp; Itll cost you though.

				Can someone who&#039;s lived here for 20+ years please explain why Pistilli dominates&nbsp; development around Astoria? I know he&#039;s got history and I&#039;m sure politics on his side, but besides the few developers, (Corcoran, Toll Brothers, etc..) who are building in LIC and not Astoria mostly, why aren&#039;t other developers buying up smaller lots and building quality? Why is most of this crap, some Mediterranean looking&nbsp; ostentatious s___ that looks like it belongs&nbsp; in Sicily or Greece? No windows, ugly balconies, or balconies that step out 1 foot outside the building, can you even call this a balcony? No kitchens to speak of,&nbsp; kitchens for people who don&#039;t know what a refrigerator is (why bother having a kitchen if you&#039;re going to store your shoes in there?) A Dwell prefab would be better than the things going up around here. I hate to say it, but Brooklyn coops/ condos are just a boatload nicer.

				You are right. Take a look at factory loft conversions in Brooklyn or even the Bronx. Excellent work. What happend to Eagle Electric, L I Savings Bank on 30th Ave, and the Steinway Piano are embarrassment that are an exercise in bad taste.<br /><br />You questions are easy to answer and all but impossible to solve unless things change. <br /><br />You have a small clique that runs Astoria and have been doing so for a very long period of time. They know each other and have no real desire (or incentive for that matter) to open up their little clubhouse. Years ago when the rest of the city was burning this made some sense, but now the city has moved forward and this little group has lot touch with progress. To ensure a quiet public, any avenue for discussion or information is blocked. Newspapers, community board, officials, and what passes for civics.<br /><br />Good luck in even trying to get a serious discussion.<br /><br />As the attitude (even on this board) demonstrates, the first reaction is to deny there is a problem, and the second (when their face is rubbed in it) is to snarl that you should move as others (more desperate and not as discriminating perhaps?) would be happy to fill your shoes. Check out the &#039;human feces thread&#039; as a stellar example of public discourse in this community.<br /><br />So you have the small time small town local talent (with no taste or sophistication) throwing up cheaply built tenements and ready to milk as much as they can as quickly as they can. As someone wrote on Queens Crap, they have written off the community and are ripping out the pipes.<br />&nbsp;<br />Architects on the community board are involved in building in the community, everyone has a fratboy approach to an empty lot - &quot;lets see how much we can make.&quot; Many people making choices on&nbsp; our future don&#039;t even live here. The largest contributor to politician&#039;s campaigns are developers. Your tax money is used to subsidize them, not provide services to your family.&nbsp;Remember that when your taxes take a big jump next year. <br /><br />When that stucco starts to fall off, fades, and gets dirty in about 20 years these developers will either be dead or in Florida.&nbsp; :x<br /><br />The west of Queens is targeted for a massive jump in population and - with no discussion of infrastructure to support it - a massive decline in quality of life. Thoughout the city, with a smirk, its called the &#039;Wild West.&#039; And Community Board One is famed as the belly of the beast. Go to another community board meeting and the difference is glaring.<br /><br />Go down to LIC or Dutch Kills. Look at communities hoodwinked and betrayed, or if that failed, simply ignored. <br /><br />That is our future.&nbsp; :cry:

				<strong>PLEASE READ </strong> <br />Hello All, <br />I have been living here since this past summer (loft on the 2nd floor) and have had some pretty significant water damage several times when it rains. This past week we noticed a black spot on our ceiling that I believe is black mold. [The Super] is supposed to be removing the ceiling and surrounding areas this week but as many of you probably know with his usual response time I doubt that will happen this week. I&#039;ve picked up a home test kit to test for Stachybotrys (black mold) which is highly toxic. If you have had water damage as well (like many of my neighbors) you may want to also. If I can see it coming through my ceiling than I am almost positive it must be growing inside. <br />Please feel free to email me or respond with any questions. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				Suigenerous1, your best better is to contact the Building Manager, immediately if the Super is not following up with your situation. The Building Manager&#039;s office is in the lobby next to the mail room. I&#039;m sorry to hear about your water problem by hopefully going to [the Building Manager] will help. The Management office needs to know about your situation as well. I know that when I had issue in my loft calling the Management office and talking directly to [them], as well, always helped.

				Stachybotrys is not as toxic as it&#039;s reputation. There are many other types of mold that are much more dangerous and insidious. If it were I, I would not rely on a home testing kit. I would call in a professional to do a full house inspection. They should take air samples and swab samples from every area of the place. I understand that there are some infrared cameras that can even detect mold that has not yet discolored enough to be visible. Before any attempts to remove and/or clean the mold you should know the type of mold you are dealing with, how sever the growth is, it&#039;s source, and then the proper process to treat, prevent and permanently remove the mold. If you own this apartment, this is an investment in your future.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				on the top balcony on the corner of 21st/23terr (NE corner of building), from the street you can see where a huge hole was made to let out water that seeped under the roof.<br /><br />also, a little birdie told me two restaurants are about to occupy some storefronts on 21st, one being a very tasty Astoria eatery that is relocating, and the other is a Thai restaurant.&nbsp; that leaves one storefront left..

How much more respectful does a tenant have to be but to simply inform you of a problem—and in the case of water damage induced mold—and expect you to reprioritize your duties to take care of the problem immediately? This has the potential to be a very serious health issue. This is not the same as taking care of someone&#039;s kitchen cabinet doors that are not perfectly aligned, or a leaking shower faucet, or even a nail protruding from a wood floor. This should have been responded to in the shortest time frame possible. <br /><br />Your tenants, Robert1919, paid exorbitant prices for the privilege of buying these apartments. Many of them are also paying for replacing the inferior quality kitchen appliances installed by the builder. The very last thing they ever would have expected was to have their health deteriorate as a result of their investment into this property, and you come here to whine about disrespectfulness. <br /><br />You can have all your notes in your little book of problems, but when the NYC Department of Buildings and the NYC Department of Health descend on your building and want to know why this safety and health condition has not been alleviated as quickly as possible, please tell them that the tenant did not treat you with the respectfulness that you feel you deserved!<br /><br />As the mother of an intractable asthmatic, all I can say is SHAME ON YOU. This unhealthy and life-threatenting moldy condition would have caused my son&#039;s death . . . and I don&#039;t take these kinds of problems lightly!

				As a tenant at 19-19 24 Avenue, I am still puzzled why someone who is having problems in their apartment would come to a website, post names, whine, etc. instead of spending that time to call the building management, cause all HELL to break out in the lobby/management office or in the worst case scenario call their attorney and/or hold back rent/maintenance. Instead they run to their keybords because that&#039;s going to solve the problem? <br /><br />NYCMacUser, with all due respect, you don&#039;t live in the building, you don&#039;t know the Super and then you go off on him based on a few postings from people you don&#039;t know?

				First, check out this scenario: I have a sharp pain in my left arm, pain in my chest and I am having problems breathing so let me log on to Web MD and see what might be causing these symptoms instead of calling 911. The point is that if this tenant thinks that their unit might have a serious health issue, coming to Astorians.com and posting is not the solution.<br /><br /><br />Secondly, I am glad you have respect for yourself.<br /><br />Third, FYI the tenant is a renter not an owner. So no purchase out of sheer desperation.<br /><br />Fourth, I have had my share of problems, some minor and some not so minor. I have found Management to be very responsive . Perhaps, it might be my big ass mouth sprinkled with a bad ass attitude that I was lucky to be in the so called &quot;small minority&quot;.

The tenant told the super about the problem and apparently was ignored. Where should a tenant go after they are ignored repeatedly by the person who is expected to fix the problem? Please bear in mind that most of us are not &quot;big ass mouth sprinkled with a bad ass attitude&quot; folks.

				NYCMacUer, <br />1) The fact that there are renters in the building with the option to buy has always been known perhaps not to the public but to us owners. As for the ownership of the land, we all know the history about so you did not discover life on Mars. <br />2) The only reason I stated that the person was a renter not an owner, was in respone to your comment &quot;who were foolish enough to have purchased an apartment there out of sheer desperation.&quot; <br />3) Fair enough, perhaps my WebMd analogy wasn&#039;t the best but the point is if it&#039;s that life threatening, posting on Astorian.com will not get you anywhere. That was the gist of my argument all this time. <br />4) The Super is the only person the tenant can go to? Oh please!!! Call the management office, attorney, etc. if its that important and life threatening its a no brainer not to be passive. <br />5) Lastly, I am not a tough guy but I expect things to get done to my satisfaction especially if my hard earned money is going toward something. Having met you, I am quite sure you can relate to this. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

Get rid of the half dead flowers, and go to home depot and pick up some slate tiles. put them over the blue tiles then get bamboo or some other plant that can survive half in/out of the water. It will look very classy and cost next to nothing for the tiles. Unless the &#039;pond&#039; leaks, i dont know the story. Just a suggestion.

				Does this building have off-street parking? If so, you guys should contact Zipcar about getting a couple of cars based there. The only Zipcars in the area are down near Socrates and in LIC. It would be a significant benefit for your building (and to me, who lives a couple blocks away!)<br /><br />Also, any more rumors on the ground-floor retail? I heard that small-business loans are down like 40% in Queens recently. I hope that that doesn&#039;t throw a wrench into the plans...

				FYI for the people who have posted issues with water and mold issues<br />this can be a health problem and very expensive to resolve properly...<br />(the information below is from a general web search)<br />Toxic mold, which can develop when an organic substance comes in contact with water<br />and can spread to many surfaces throughout a home, is a problem in buildings across<br />New York City.<br />Any indoor mold, including species that are not considered toxic, can, in sufficient<br />quantities, have adverse effects on susceptible populations, such as children, the elderly,<br />and asthmatics. Exposure to sufficient quantities of any kind of indoor mold is likely to<br />aggravate asthma conditions and provoke other severe allergic reactions. An additional<br />long-term effect of mold exposure is that it can increase a child’s chances of becoming<br />asthmatic; even fetal exposure can increase the risk of developing asthma.<br />Mold destroys the surface it grows on by digesting the organic material. It can rot wood,<br />drywall, and other construction materials, eventually causing structural damage.<br />Roof leaks, faulty plumbing, flooding, and high levels of humidity can all<br />contribute to destructive indoor mold growth.<br />How do I get rid of mold?<br />It is impossible to get rid of all mold and mold spores indoors; some mold spores will be found floating through the air and in house dust.&nbsp; The mold spores will not grow if moisture is not present.&nbsp; Indoor mold growth can and should be prevented or controlled by controlling moisture indoors.&nbsp; If there is mold growth in your home, you must clean up the mold and fix the water problem.&nbsp; If you clean up the mold, but don&#039;t fix the water problem, then, most likely, the mold problem will come back.<br />

				WOW that is pretty detailed stuff about mold!. Thank you for that. It sounds like people should take this a little more seriously, instead of bashing other people. I have been reading this blog for a while now and this thread seems to be the most heated. I think it is good that people can come on here and find out info about things going on with this building and around Astoria. So this is a very helpful tool. Sounds like some of the people in this building need to understand the whole issue here (mold) before they just brush it aside and give someone advise on where they can go to get help within the building or state that the super comes quickly when called. It seems it is everyone&#039;s issue (mold) who lives in this building not just the people that have visible presence of mold. I hope it all works out for everyone. Good Luck!

				People really! So many negative responses to the building. Look at the positives - your next to a park, hm, guess that&#039;s it. The truth is your always going to have issues when you move into a new building. But MOLD and water damage???? Wow, those are some biggies! You would think with what they charge in maintenance fees, $1 per square foot, they would have the money to fix this. My recommendation to those thinking of moving here, look at all your options first.&nbsp; Good luck to all!!

Twice my apt flooded and LL refused to pay for damages. Front door was broeke into and took them a MONTH to install a new security door. He &#039;let himself in&#039; my apartment to get the rent cash (he didnt take checks). Took 3 months to fix the bug issue we had.

				Aside from obvious health problems brought on by mold, water damage can lead to serious structural problems if it&#039;s chronic. If it&#039;s an older building (like most of the homes surrounding the Pistilli place with wood beams) water damage can lead to termite infestation-a pretty commom problem here in Astoria. If the exterior of the building is covered in that man-made stucco stuff mold will set in and grow if there is a leak. I think the Eagle building-er, I mean Pistilli building- is covered in EIF. That synthetic stucco stuff isn&#039;t all that it&#039;s cracked up to be. It&#039;s been associated with moisture problems. If the leaks are interior in origin, then you have a whole different can of worms!<br /><br />http://www.almosthome.com/eifsFaq.htm<br /><br />(I&#039;m not a contractor, but I wouldn&#039;t use this stuff on my home.)<br /><br />Hope the above info helps!

				Question for you folks who live there - is there no Coop Board?&nbsp; If not, should you not form one?&nbsp; Look, I was happy to see the old factory converted but I was not happy that it was Pistilli, who has a negative reputation in Queens.&nbsp; Obviously, a sense of good design does not run in their family.&nbsp; In spite of this, I have seen some of the apartments and they look quite nice and there are benefits to living there - the park, the workout facilities, the laundry rooms etc.<br /><br />Instead of complaining on this forum however, which no one from Pistilli is likely to view or do anything, why not get together and form a board that can represent tenants / owners rights and complaints?&nbsp; I think that if this were to happen, they would have no alternative but to listen to you and do something about the issues.<br /><br />Instead of telling people to &#039;stay away&#039; from the building, why not do something to help yourselves, those of you who have an investment in this building???

				Although co-ops and condominiums are both considered &quot;common interest developments&quot; a co-op building is owned by a cooperative housing corporation, while in a condominium, each unit owner owns their individual apartment. Co-op owners do not own their units but they own a share in the cooperative corporation, and that co-op share gives them sole right to their living space.

				Magnetic sheets are great in hiding the symptom, but they are not a cure. It is not uncommon for cold air to come through the vent, but it is always wrong. The purpose of any &quot;vent&quot; is to remove air from the space. I would definitely talk to the super, but do some research first.

				Well.. I&#039;m officially an Astorian. Having lived in Kew Garden Hills practically all my life this is a nice change of scenery. Unfortunately my fiance insisted on this PGM complex. She just can&#039;t tolerate roaches.. so older buildings are a no-no. Well I wish I read a little more online before committing to this 1 year rental. Aside from the totally craptacular no-frills appliances. The warping Pergo-laminate flooring. Here&#039;s some things that aren&#039;t mentioned:<br /><br />1) There&#039;s no cooking gas at ALL. Having spoken with someone that has lived here since last summer, that hasn&#039;t changed for 7 months. This adds $$$ to my bottom line when I have to spend extra money on take out. Buy new temporary electric appliances (crock pot, convection ovens, etc). Adds to my electric bill. <br /><br />2) Right now as of this writing there is no water. They turned it off without any notice this morning. No time to bottle or store water in a pot.<br /><br />3) The doorman is only there for 1 shift. Which is not a big deal but... (see next gripe)<br /><br />4) There are no security cameras to speak of for such a huge place. It&#039;s not a dangerous neighborhood but anything to deter riff-raffs would be nice.<br /><br />5) It&#039;s kind of eerie living in a building with 180 units and having only 10-20 apts filled. Nice if you like to go streaking down the halls in the middle of the night. <br /><br />6) Good luck if you live in one of the apartments in the back of the building. You&#039;ll have to walk from the front of the building to take the elevator in order to walk all the way to back. Worse yet.. if you pay for their parking lot.. you&#039;ll have to walk from the parking lot (back) to the front and all the way back again. Good luck with those bags of groceries.<br /><br />7) Pistilli, in their infinite wisdom, installed a high gloss marble floor at the top of the steps extending from the glass foyer. So during this last snow storm (before the superintendent puts out the salt or mats) I almost break my neck. That is a lawsuit just waiting to happen. Remember as condo owner that&#039;s on your head.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll have more complaints as the weeks turn into months..<br /><br />-Slappy

				So searching online i have read things here and there about this (Pistilli) building and so forth. However i have been looking for apartments in astoria for the passed 2 months (30+ apts) and i haven&#039;t found none nearly as nice as this one. All the apartments i have seen have been either too small, to expensive and small or just plain garbage. Now i want to know why/how this place is any different with the management (etc) as ive seen posted online? I have lived in Astoria for 2+ years and have had the same problem with my current apt as people are having at this building. Problems such as cold winters, hot summers, pluming takes forever to fix, water leaks, etc. Now people are saying they are having these problems at the pistilli buildings... So my guess is the people that are complaining are either use to extravagant way of living (rich people) or they&#039;ve never lived outside of there parents house till they bought/rented the apt here at the Pistilli locations. So, what should i be looking forward to when i move in the Pistilli building over at Ditmars...any input would be nice.<br />Thanks

				everything i&#039;ve ever heard about these Pistilli buildings has been horrible. it looks like people finally moved into the units on the 21st St building by the park, after years of waiting to get in. <br /><br />prdct, if pistilli refuses to help, could you just hire you own exterminator and then subtract the bill from your rent? i&#039;ve personally done this for other pest problems in the past, always gets the landlords attention real quick.

				OK well the bed bugs seem to be a big problem, do you know if that is the case at the Ditmars locations too? Since i have dealt with landlords that take forever to do something that isn&#039;t too uncommon for me. Is there any other complaints about the place i should know though. Cause as ive stated ive seen some crappy looking apts for more with much less space. i would say about %90 of apts i have seen looks like this. With the Pisitilli building im seeing more space, for slightly less expensive (still little expensive) for a newly done apt. Don&#039;t get me wrong i am not planning to buy, its only for rent. I think i were buying all the complaints ive heard i wouldnt even consider buying a condo-but for rent it seems reasonable to me...am i right or wrong here?

				Hey All,<br />My lawyer is currently revising a contract for a unit in this building but I&#039;m having some hesitations after reading though this forum and other websites.<br />Here&#039;s whats in my contract:<br />Buying Price: 281K - negotiated down from around 360, but they said they originally wanted to sell it for 400K+<br />950 square feet<br />Maintenance: approx $500/month - includes heat, hot water, insurance<br />Real Estate Taxes: approx $400/month<br /><br />Okay, here are some issues/questions that I&#039;ve been having.<br />1. When I asked why there wasnt a tax abatement, he said the building missed the deadline. Is this a legitimate excuse? Isn&#039;t that a poor excuse for something so significant? The broker also said that what I can do is file for something (I&#039;d have to ask my accountant) that would reevaluate my taxes and that it would significantly go down afterwards. When I told my lawyer, he said that was wrong, and that taxes were based on the assessed value of the property. So, it&#039;ll stay at the $400/month price.<br /><br />2. Are there any current owners in this forum? Can you tell me what I should expect from the management? Are they helpful, do they get back to you in a timely manner? Are there actual cases where things like no heat, no water, no gas occur? I read that Pistilli&#039;s other buildings have had problems with water leakage. Does anything like this happen in this building? <br /><br />3. I asked the broker for some comparables in the building and asked how much people have been buying for. He said that he&#039;s not allowed to tell me the details when the deals are in contract. There must have been people who already bought the units, but he didnt tell me those prices - why? I eventually found a website that gave me the details and found units that sold for around the same price as mine but about 50 sqft larger. <br /><br />4. Considering there is no tax abatement and a lot of renovations have to be done, I calculated that an extra 60K (40K from tax abatement you&#039;d be saving in another building + 20k for renovations) would need to be put in for the unit. That would mean I&#039;m essentially paying 281+60 = 341K. <br /><br />I know of all the things I&#039;ve said and read, the clear thing would be to forget about this unit but I think if it&#039;s renovated, there could be potential because of the location and the good size. Also, I don&#039;t think I can find anything in Astoria for 341K that&#039;s 950 sqft. Thoughts? Comments? Suggestions?

				It looks like most of the current occupants are renting, not buying. Must be a reason.<br />Also, what kind of renovations are you looking at ? I thought these were fairly new units ?<br />I&#039;d like to hear from current tenants......talk to neighbors.

				I&#039;ve looked at those apartments...and there were a couple of issues I had with them:<br /><br />- Windows have <strong>no screens </strong> and they are too large - need custom made shades &amp; screens (more $$$).<br /><br />- The <strong>range hood </strong> above the stove is blank inside (there&#039;s no fan motor)...it&#039;s only there for decoration.<br /><br />- The <strong>laminated flooring</strong> they used scratches easily.<br /><br />- And even though <strong>heat</strong> is included in the maint. you need electricity to run the fan motor and spread the heat and a/c throughout your apartment. Your electric bill is going to be high.<br /><br />-The <strong>gym</strong> is too far into the lower level - it seems like a dungeon down there.

				<em><strong>No One should have to live with bedbugs, roaches etc.&nbsp; It is one thing to discover you have infestation or are somewhat affected by such but the Management or landlords should respond and address these issues immediately.&nbsp; Yes, it is expensive to take care of bedbugs but the renter and or owners have a right to a safe and comfortable life.&nbsp; I have to disagree with anyone that thinks it&#039;s acceptable to accept things as they exist- you shouldn&#039;t have to be wealthy to live in a bug free environment (unless I misunderstood).&nbsp; NYC in general has a major bedbug epidemic but it is controlable if management resolves to do so.</strong></em>

I have yet to come across a landlord or super who is on top of things. Mind you i&#039;m making middle class wages here, so obviously the more money you make the better the living. However with middle class wages you get what you can get in the NYC area. Any who i&#039;ve had issue with various things in the apt at the Pistilli building but all in all its not that bad (as of yet) and aside from the rent cost. I&#039;ve been here for a little over 6 months and haven&#039;t minded dealing with the Pistilli ppl-the good so far is outweighing the bad by a good amount.<br /><br />Side Note<br />-Not related to Astoria or the Pistilli building, has anyone seeked out apts in long island, near the long island mall.

				I hold no brief for Valone but i sincerely doubt that Pistilli&#039;s $7500 in contributions over the course of a decade correlates with anything much at all.&nbsp; <br /><br />That said, what a nightmare for the residents.

				Wow!&nbsp; How else can we get the word out and expose Pistilli?&nbsp; He needs to be exposed.&nbsp; He made so many promises to the community and wound up to be nothing better than a slum lord.&nbsp; He and his family should be banned from developing anything else in our community.&nbsp; I hope he has lost millions in this and the other monstrosity on Ditmars Blvd.

				On behalf of the PRE Tenants&#039; Association, thank you 28Grand and thank you to everyone who has recognized the situation we the tenants are in, and why we are fighting instead of walking away and letting some other poor individual or family take over the problems we have been dealing with. <br /><br />Staying silent is not the answer and by staying silent, landlords like Pistilli continue to profit from despicable actions and in general, disregarding the community (and yes, JP, residents of PRE are part of the community) in which he does business.

I&#039;m also guessing that the repair work that was done to my apartment 6/15-6/18 is the reason why the same apartment next door to me suddenly developed a water leak since then.

I have been served with eviction papers, been to court, granted and Order to Show Cause (OSC) which stops the eviction process, and given a court date of 7/16/2010 to argue the case in front of a judge. This is in addition to the existing court date I have on 7/21/2010 which is a follow-up to the court proceedings from 6/14/2010. <br />It would be great if residents in the building would join me in going through the court process. I understand why they are reluctant to do so. This has been a miserable process and because the apartments are not rent stabilized, the tenants here make too much money to qualify for legal assistance and therefore must pay out of pocket for legal representation. I have been representing myself which makes the process even more frustrating because I often learn a better or quicker way I could have filed or done things- after the fact. Live and learn. I&#039;m sure learning a lot!

				The construction is the same at Pistilli Grand Manor on Ditmars. They are very poorly constructed buildings. We&#039;ve been watching that building come together for 4 years-- the decorative molding falls off of the exterior, the window mullions are not aligned or in some cases even attached, the door openings within the apartments are not regular or even standard widths, the windows don&#039;t have screens-- they&#039;re just badly built. Every Pistilli property should be avoided like the plague.

				Some will, after we have the 1/3 of renters we need to make the tenants&#039; association official. At that time, we can file a group HP Action. That will make the process easier on each individual tenant and as an official association, tenants will have more protection against possible retaliation by the landlord. As someone who did this as an individual and not as a group, I don&#039;t blame them. <br />I&#039;ve paid out of pocket for an attorney, paid filing fees in court, spent more than $100 on parking garage fees for court dates and filing papers in court, had to take more than 30 days off of work (since moving in) for issues related to the apartment, plus lots of other miscellaneous inconveniences and nuisances that just made my life pretty unpleasant. <br />We&#039;ll see what happens.

PM me if you want to discuss further re how to proceed but to keep initial costs down obviously you must recruit/implore others to &quot;man up&quot; -as an outside observer this is a TOTALLY ridiculous situation.

				The Daily News contacted me regarding a story they are pursuing related to problems with Pistilli Realty properties. This is about more than Pistilli Riverview East and from what I understand, they are looking to cover Pistilli Grand Manor, The Astral &amp; other properties as well. If you are a current or former tenant of a Pistilli owned building, please read the rest of this message.<br /><br />I have agreed to be interviewed and have my identity revealed. The reporter would like to interview at least two other tenants from each building as well as former tenants. I informed her that I would ask and if anyone is interested in being interviewed, I would forward her the contact information for those individuals.<br /><br />She has promised to conceal the identity of anyone, other than me, who agrees to be interviewed. If you agree to be interviewed, your name will not be used and your apartment number will not be identified, unless you provide the reporter with express, written permission to do so.<br /><br />Please contact me as soon as possible if you would like to be interviewed for this news article.<br /><br />Thank you.

				I live in the building across the street from Astoria Park. My Girlfriend owns the Apartment and is probably one of the frist people to live in the building. we have had some minor problems with leaks but i have to say everything was repaired in a timely manner. not to say i have not heard the horror stories about massive leaks and whatnot, i know them to be true and i am not really clear on why our luck has been so good.<br />I find that the maintenance staff has always taken care of us and i think they are good guys that do a pretty good job around the building. Especially now with the pool open and all the trash that gets dumped around the perimeter of the building. its never there for long although it is a bit messier on the backside of the building. <br />now building management is a different story. i believe we are on our second building manager since the site has opened. the first guy was totally useless, i dont even remember his name. now its run by Pitsilli&#039;s son and nephew (both named michael) and i think we deal mostly with the nephew. he doesnt seem to care about anything and he takes his sweet time responding to your calls. so now we just go straight to the supervisor of the maintenance crew, his name is Robert and he is top class. always returns calls promptly and when he tells you a time that somebody will be there they are there. i guess i&#039;m just trying to say that not everyone in the building is bad and i hope that if this daily news thing brings about any changes that its to pitstillui and building management and not to the hard working maintenance crew.

There are good things about this building and it is very unfortunate that Pistilli manages this property in a way that only the bad is what is discussed. If it was all bad, I would have just moved instead of fighting to get my apartment repaired doing everything I can to make Pistilli follow the same laws that all landlords of multi-dwelling properties of this size must follow. <br />In regards to the building workers, yes, most of them are nice people. That doesn&#039;t change the fact that they are not qualified to to perform many of the repairs which they are being asked to do. That&#039;s not their fault and that fact is clearly stated on the blog in several different posts and replies to comments.<br />

				Despite court ordered repairs 6/15-6/18 in my apartment, the repair work was done by Pistilli&#039;s choice of repair people. The result is that I still have the same leaking floor and, as a bonus, two new leaking areas in my apartment. <br /><br />http://thetruthaboutpistillirivervieweast.wordpress.com/2010/07/24/another-failed-repair-job-at-pistilli-riverview-east/

				Hi,<br /><br />I just came across this thread. I&#039;ve been in the river view east since 2008 when they started rentals, been renting for about roughly 2 years. I love the area and I love the people that reside in the building along with great access to famous Astoria park! I must say I have a pet, so it&#039;s with ease of my morning to take a walk right around the way. I can agree with you that waking up every time there is a major rainfall does suck, but Pistilli in my residence in the building has never left me stranded. There is always two sides of a story and as we know the good and bad of something, so I thought I would also share my story.<br /><br />I was lucky to be one of those apartments that didn&#039;t have a water leak continuous, but since they fixed the side where I reside 23rd terrace, I have been leak free..... so far. I am happy along with that and not major rent hikes for the space, quality, and terrace... I am happy. I can truly say the management does lack in certain aspects, but nothing that is getting blown out of proportion. I have never been left with a problem longer then a manageable time, of course we are all human beings and surely we all can get frustrated. <br /><br />The building overall is great, maintained truly well by our porters, of course Robert our super works very hard, can you say you have a super that will come to your apartment at 3AM to help with a leak?? On the other hand Belkis the office manager is very hard to get in touch with and I do agree with you that if you place a call for her, you will never get a call back or you will be pushed to one of her many office assistants. The dollar for the square footage is definitely holding me in, because with all the furniture I was able to get back when I first got the place not sure if I can find a place for the money I pay now and that will allow me to have a pet.<br /><br />I understand your point fully and do read your postings and I do hope you get the help you deserve, I wouldn&#039;t want to be in a problem like that either...... The building is definitely not a slum, I would encourage anyone that would like to view a place in here to contact me to view my place. I hope you have a good night. Thanks for reading.<br /><br />Cool site BTW.&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br />

				I live in a Pistilli owned building and here is how I get things fixed: <br />Call every single day (gradually increasing to twice and three times a day) until the person you need to talk to is not &quot;out for lunch&quot;, &quot;not in today&quot;, &quot;hold on, oh he/she&#039;s in a meeting&quot;.&nbsp; It takes at least a week and is infuriating, but it works.&nbsp; I also find that quoting housing code works somewhat quicker if you happen to have an issue of that level (like having the right to live in a vermin-free environment).&nbsp; <br /><br />Hope your ceiling is hole-free, hannahlly!

				It&#039;s important to know if your security deposit is in Pistilli&#039;s bank for many reasons. The bank, First Central Savings Bank, was recently fined $100,000 by the FDIC and ordered to pay restitution to account holders affected by the bank&#039;s failure to disclose an &quot;interest-floor&quot; on applicable accounts. First Central is on multiple industry lists of &quot;troubled&quot; banks and the March, 25, 2010 rating and review by The Street, gives First Central Savings Bank a Safety Rating of E, Very Weak Financial Strength.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “The E rating means that, in our opinion, this institution currently demonstrates what we consider to be significant weaknesses and has also failed some of the basic test we use to identify fiscal stability. Therefore, even in a favorable economic environment, it is our opinion that depositors or creditors could incur significant risks.”<br /><br />For more information, you can read the blog post http://thetruthaboutpistillirivervieweast.wordpress.com/2010/08/02/is-your-security-deposit-in-pistillis-bank/ or click on the individual information sources listed below.<br /><br /><br />Sources:<br />FDIC Order: http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:7-BeAbFHywIJ:www.fdic.gov/bank/individual/enforcement/2010-02-29.pdf+first+central+savings+bank+fdic&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESiV143msTcKMe6uhrcG9p6B14wqWVxtXe8yxQww0PTX5_0vhIa2bjl22eo6YrrhbEET1q-iNcHwGGC2rY9PLg3xgXDbV36nYV8x1UtbW_QDsSBrahsHBtXl5uycj4OvVOAViYlu&amp;sig=AHIEtbSs1wP_Yq2QVPRkEhKx2KxKPwO1XA<br />The Street Rating: http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:Qz0CXD4j8MkJ:www.thestreet.com/tsc/ratings/pdfdata/WEBRATS/B/FREECSU_0F1E0E41-6F80-4C3E-B36A-4E50391B2130.PDF+first+central+savings+bank+glen+cove&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESgfDnMiI1eJZvvpDADRB0XUUh_g92aTc0QG4kXBxmqOO0V8XkwNCwGqi8XaaJxLxyKiTqZHk3tp4NB_hLY_p9OSpDJCw-Wmum__eEyerL59u3APq9xFQeKGiRmJK0IJ5J3lOMif&amp;sig=AHIEtbQS3IOYGdsB2_mOfACh9-i8ZUk4Vg

Anyone willing to put in the time and effort can find the information. I started with a search to find out what the name of the bank is that Pistilli owns/whatever, found the name of the bank here, on Astorians, then did a search with the bank name and then tried adding words such as trouble, fraud, etc. and eventually I found the info that I cited in my post.<br />

				I used to live in a Pistilli building for a number of years.&nbsp; When I finally moved out, it took a number of phonecalls and quoting of the law to the Pistilli Realty office, but in the end I did receive my check.&nbsp; I think most landlords are counting on people giving up and/or forgetting about the money.

				I currently live in Pistilli Riverview and my lease ends next month. Given the bad reputation of Mr Pistilli and his management team, I am concerned about my deposit check. Can I use it towards my last month&#039;s rent?

				hi,&nbsp; sorry for the cross-post, but im trying to get CURRENT opinions on riverview east.&nbsp; heres my original post.&nbsp; feel free to message me directly if youd prefer:<br />Any recent thoughts on Pistilli Riverview East?&nbsp; Good place to live or bad place to live?&nbsp; (note: I know they had serious leakage problems before which seem to have been resolved as I can&#039;t find any complaints about it within the last 2 years or so, and I know there are a lot of Pistilli haters out there, but I&#039;d like to know people&#039;s thoughts only on living in Riverview East.)<br />Thanks!
