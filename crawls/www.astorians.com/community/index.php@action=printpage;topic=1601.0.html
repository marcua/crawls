				i would love to see if there is!<br />i love these bad boys myself. i always have to wait for my friend&#39;s yearly package from Nana in Louisiana to get my fix. Its the double decker ones that are key...<br /><br />ok, i have had one in the city... Trailer Park Bar downtown sells the single ones for an arm and a leg from what i can remember. i went awhile back and its a fun kind of place, so if your there for drinks and snacks well then a Moon Pie is def in order for the train ride home!

				Well, when Food Lion comes to town, I bet you&#39;ll be able to get them there.<br /><br />Just reading their website, they seem to have done some interesting things.&nbsp; For instance, there&#39;s a whole page entitled &quot;Animal Welfare.&quot;&nbsp; I&#39;ll be curious to check them out when they come to town.

				AWESOME.<br />Lets locate some moonshine, Portuguese or otherwise.<br />Who&#39;s in for ordering a case of moon pies with me? Let&#39;s make a list, like the Girl Scouts do and I might even put on a beret and come house to house distributing them but no guarantees that I&#39;m being a &quot;productive young scout&quot; or anything, just moonpie madness at the wholesale level.<br />And then, when the weather looks a bit more... shall we say, consistent, then we can have a white-trash party or something!

				Moon Pies have GOT to be available somewhere in New York. &nbsp;I&#39;ve been familiar with them my whole life, though I&#39;ve never been a frequent consumer. &nbsp;Even Tastykakes are sold here, so Moon Pies surely must be.

				Yeeeeeeah I totally thought the same thing-- but admittedly I&#39;ve lost faith in NYC&#39;s ability to procure anything rare for me after seeing what people out here will call a fish taco. Damn, people, its supposed to be a CORN tortilla and no its not supposed to cost $12 at Rosa Mexicana or whatever! hehe sorry I digress.... so the idea is to get some double-decker moonpies (bonus points for the vanilla flavor!) at prices that <em>aren&#39;t</em> embarassingly inflated... I&#39;m still lookin around but the online bulk purchase may be most prudent...

				I had a boatload of Moon Pies a few years ago. I brought them up from Sneedville, TN. If I&#39;d known there was any demand I&#39;d have set up a a distribution channel.<br /><br />What about Scooter pies? I remember seeing those at Pathmark and imagining them a suitable moon pie replacement. Not sure if they&#39;re individually wrapped, though.<br />

				A year ago Food World on 36th Ave had Moon Pies briefly (were they the ones with Banana icing)?&nbsp; Goo-Goo&#39;s were readily available at Pathmark 6 or 7 years ago (ah yes, during my infamous weight-addition campaign&nbsp; :roll:) so I&#39;m trying to remember that there were two varieties, one of which I fell for heavily.

Good prices, good portions, good taste. Fast, friendly and efficient vendor personnel. The corner and area is kept noticeably clean. Convenient location via subway - areas nearby to sit and eat, i.e., near Central Park. They even cater!&quot; <br /><br />&quot;The tastiest food in the city! The line always borders on epic, and people are fanatical about the food. Five dollars for the choice of chicken and rice or lamb and rice. The white sauce has an almost cult following. I&#39;ve talked to people in line there who had driven from New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Only food stand I&#39;ve been to with such a loyal and intense fanbase.

				WE HAVE A PROBLEM!!<br />Someone in my office just told me that the cart is only there AFTER 8pm on weekdays?!?! I checked on the Vendys awards site and... <strong>its true</strong>. Bizarro hours for a kabob cart, but there you go. Mental note: if you&#39;re ever trapped in midtown after 8pm Halal Team cart food is your friend, I guess. <br /><br />A one-way ticket to Disappointmentville. What do we do now? ...maybe just get kabobs from one of the regulars on the west side of 6th ave? Dammit.

				Argh. I know. I&#39;m crestfallen. Sorry I didnt do more research on that Food Cart Tip; I just assumed that food carts would be open for lunch. duh?<br />Well I could always just go for chicken and rice from one of the carts here near the fountain... a let down, but I cant think of anything on the dreaded Concourse that would ameliorate my remorse!<br />

				Well punctual they may not be down there in Moon Pie HQ, but it was nice of them to respond anyways. Thanks for posting it, Jonathan... now if I ever set foot in a WalMart (hasn&#39;t happened yet), I&#39;ll know what I can get!! <br />I ate one of the flooz-ordered moon pies like the second she gave it to me and it was so sublime I almost forgot I was in my office... it was like I was magically transported back to the summer of 1988 when my dad brought a whole box along with us camping... YUM. My craving is finally satiated!! Thanks to everyone who humored and/or joined in with me on my enthusiastic search...

				Hey Flooz -&nbsp; you still peddling those moon pies? I&#39;d totally buy a couple off of ya! (I&#39;m new to the boards - as you well know - and missed this whole thread!)<br /><br />By the way, there seems to be a good deal of Southerners around here. Where&#39;s everyone from? I&#39;m from Texas (and still at work. and very bored).<br /><br />PS - RC is the best partner for the moon pie. There was a place near my old apartment that had it on tap. It was the most blessed thing on a hot day!

				If you&#39;re going to be at the beer garden on Friday, maybe I can get them from you then? I&#39;ll take 2. I haven&#39;t had a moonpie in SUCH a long time!<br /><br />PS, regarding my earlier note about finding RC on tap, just spotted it last night at Rizzos on Steinway, which, FYI, was noted as one of the best sicillian pies by New York mag a couple of weeks ago. It is definitely worth walking the extra few blocks for me on my way home from work!<br /><br />Okay, all this thinking about food has made me hungry - thank goodness it&#39;s lunch time!

				...well, Long Island City, anyway.<br />You&#39;ll find both the chocolate and the vanilla Moonpies (triple-deckers, all of &#39;em) in the convenience store at the BP gas station at the intersection of Steinway and Northern Blvd. I think they&#39;re only about a buck each.<br /><br />But if you&#39;re looking to buy gas, that BP station SUCKS! All of the credit card machines at the pumps are broken, and have been for at least a year now. I&#39;ve been complaining to them about this for months, and have yet to see them do anything about it.

				Moon Pies are nice, but GooGoo clusters are what I yearn for.&nbsp; I can&#39;t believe they really have them in Elmhurst - I&#39;m going to have to get over there and see if I can find them.&nbsp; I look for them when I&#39;m back in my homestate of in Georgia, but they seem to be harder to find each year.
