				<br />Hi, I don&#039;t have a place yet but I need a couple people to look with. My budget&#039;s about 600-700 a month--it&#039;s low but I bet we can find something. My name&#039;s Alice, I&#039;m an artist in my 20s, I have a steady job and I&#039;ve lived in a lot of roommate situations (I used to move a lot). So I&#039;m pretty clean (extremely afraid of getting roaches), very respectful. I have no preference in regards to age, gender, religion, sexuality, profession, etc. I do think it would be cool to live with some other visual artists and turn the communal space into a work space. But if not, I&#039;m cool confining that stuff to my room. Let&#039;s get coffee and see if we hit it off.<br /><br />

				Hi,<br />My name is Evelyn and my budget is very similar to yours.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I&#039;m a teacher, not an artist, but I&#039;ve moved a lot as well and I need to find some roommates.&nbsp; If you&#039;re still looking, contact me. :smiley:

				Hi Evelyn! I looking to move by the end of this month or mid May (the earlier the better). I&#039;m 23, female and will be starting full time as a Marketing Coordinator responsible, non creepy and like to read books and watch mystery shows on netflix. If you&#039;re interested please email me at chromered@live.com<br /><br /><br />Thanks!

				I am also look to move to Astoria. One of my friends recommended it, so I checked it out. I love the area, now I have to move there. I am looking to move May 1st (or earlier) and my budget is also $600-700 per month. Preferably something with a yard (I heard they have 1/10th acre zones, that would be perfect). Please feel free to contact me.

				Hi. My name is Craig. I&nbsp; was wondering if you are also still looking for rommates just like the other girl. I don&#039;t know if you would mind having a guy roommate but I am in the same situation. I am a clean person who is looking for roommates that like to hang out on the weekend and go have some fun. My budget is between 500 and 550. I am looking in Astoria also. Please let me know if you find something in Astoria.

				<span style="font-size: medium;" class="bbc_size">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hi there, I&#039;m new to this site, but willing to look into it. I &#039;m a blind and disabled man looking for a room or apartment that can be shared, but my income is rather limited. I can only offer to pay $200.00 a month maximum.</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;" class="bbc_size">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I get along with anyone that I have spoken to and am very honest. Am a professor of languages and I am very clean and also cook excellent meals, if you would like to be treated well at home. I hope you might consider me as a room-mate as I like to be around the apartment(homebody)in the evening.</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;" class="bbc_size">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Please contact me and we can discuss this further.</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;" class="bbc_size">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thank You - Philippe</span>
