				Hey Astorians,<br />I&#039;ve recently decided that I&#039;m done with Chase.&nbsp; I spent a lot of frustrating time back and forth with them trying to figure out how to keep my accounts there to no avail.&nbsp; I have two accounts: one for me and one for my business and I was grandfathered in to these accounts from WaMu.&nbsp; <br /><br />My question is for other small business owners in Astoria: Where do you bank?&nbsp; I&#039;m looking for a no-fee checking account, convenient locations, good reliable fast online banking, and little or no minimum balance.&nbsp; <br /><br />So far, my finalists are:<br />TD Bank<br />Capital One<br />Bank of America<br /><br />Does anyone have any recommendations?&nbsp; (Or, if the days of free checking are over, let me know.&nbsp; Maybe I&#039;m just holding on to the dream.)&nbsp;

				i&#039;ve used capital one (aka greenpoint &amp; northfork) for 6 years for banking for my graphic design studio in astoria. the online banking is much better and the only hassle we&#039;ve run into is a wait period of up to 2 weeks for checks over $5,000. this isn&#039;t a huge problem. that said, they have been pretty much no-fuss. if you are near 31st &amp; ditmars branch, stop in and talk to rhonda.<br /><br />our account is no-fee and we make all of our deposits (since we are not paid in cash) through the atm. never had a problem.<br /><br />recently opened a safe deposit box at astoria federal credit union and was impressed with them, too. they also offer no-fee business checking.

				I have both my personal and business accounts with TD Bank and I love them.&nbsp; You have to keep a small balance in the account monthly to avoid a monthly fee but the first year is free if you wanted to give them a whirl.&nbsp; What I like best is the super convenient hours they have.&nbsp; I would reccommend them.

				After much research, I decided to stick with Chase.&nbsp; Turns out, free checking is becoming a thing of the past with most other banks.&nbsp; And banks that offer it free for a year are only delaying my hassle of finding a new bank in a year.&nbsp; Chase bank has &quot;Business Basic&quot; account which is free IF you use the debit card 5 times in a month (OR have direct deposit over a certain amount OR have a min. daily balance of $5,000 -- neither of which applies to me.)&nbsp; You can then link your &quot;premier&quot; personal account for free.&nbsp; I think I can manage that.<br /><br />The hassle annoying part is that you have to go into the bank and switch all the accounts up.&nbsp; I went in to explain this to Chase and they are aware of it and how annoying it is and really worked to make it as painless for me as possible.&nbsp; And I must say, the customer service I got today was really good.&nbsp; My original annoyance was directed at one person at one branch so I decided to try another branch and had a MUCH better experience.&nbsp; (Just for them to admit that it&#039;s annoying helped a lot.)&nbsp; In the end, a major selling point was the bazillion ATM&#039;s and branches around the city.&nbsp; <br /><br />That&#039;s my two cents.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Good to know.&nbsp; I ended up with HSBC business - they have free business checking and a whole lotta other perks.&nbsp; http://www.us.hsbc.com/1/2/3/business/checking/direct-checking?code=MIW0000405&amp;WT.ac=HBUS_MIW0000405&nbsp; The&nbsp; bad thing is they are not in Astoria but they don&#039;t charge ATM fees for using other banks.&nbsp; Branches are all over Manhattan and in other areas of Queens as well.&nbsp; I did walk up and down Ditmars and practically every bank but Chase offers free personal checking, including Astoria Federal, Marathon, Capital One, Alma, and Atlantic.&nbsp; Since I work at home, using a local bank for quick cashing is really not a problem and when I&#039;m in the city, I use HSBC.
