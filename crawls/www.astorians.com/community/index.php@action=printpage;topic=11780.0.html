				Hello,<br /><br />I understand this is kind of a bizarre request, but hear me out.&nbsp; I&#039;m a die-hard Madden fan.&nbsp; I picked up my copy at the Steinway St. Gamestop today.<br /><br />The problem is, is that the game freezes on my 360 within 10 minutes of playing -- randomly, and without fail.&nbsp; I went back to Gamestop, exchanged the disc, and still have the same problems.<br /><br />I can send the game back to EA under warranty, but I want to see first if it&#039;s a) a bad batch of games that went out to the local Gamestop, or b) my system.<br /><br />To rule out (b), I want to test my copy on someone else&#039;s 360 to see if it works.&nbsp; So if anyone with a 360 lives around 37th St. and 31st Ave. and wants to get in a game of Madden (I&#039;d bring my controller), PM me.&nbsp; I could bring a couple beers too to sweeten the deal.<br /><br />This whole thing is just frustrating the hell out of me.<br /><br />Thanks.

				My husband has had the exact problem before, did exactly what you did, still problems...only with a hockey game. After looking long and hard and talking to someone at EA and some people that had the same problem, he was told to empty his cache and see what happens.&nbsp; And that seemed to clear it up. That is not to say that it has never happened again...however, that trick always seemed to fix the situation for awhile.

				If you haven&#039;t done it before....<br /><br />to clear the xbox 360&#039;s memory cache,<br />1. go to the system blade on your menu(should be the very last one)<br />2. go down to were it says memory, click on it. this should bring up your hard drive or other storage devices, press a on the one you want to empty<br />3. once you&#039;ve gotten to the screen were it shows rename or format your storage device, input Y,X,X,LB,RB,X,X and a prompt will come up asking you if you want to empty your systems cache.

				Thanks for the reply.<br /><br />I just tried this a little bit earlier, but unfortunately the problem persists.<br /><br />After reading some Madden message boards though, at least I discovered that I&#039;m not alone with this problem.

PS3 usually just collects dust, but i have been playing Uncharted this week.
