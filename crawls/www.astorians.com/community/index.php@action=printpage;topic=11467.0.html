				GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Help me get my sanity back!&nbsp; This is almost too stupid for words.<br /><br />A few years ago when the tv show Deadliest Catch first came on, I was, like many other people, in awe of the bravery of the men who work on the Alaskan crab fishing boats - the ocean, the cold, the danger of the job!&nbsp; But I didn&#039;t feel any need to go on line and talk about it.&nbsp; Then one day, while scanning the Discovery Channel website, I saw that some of the boats had their own websites.&nbsp; I looked at a few, and for some reason stayed with the Time Bandit. <br />&nbsp;<br />I started posting messages there, though the company that hosted the website seemed to be strangely amateurish, considering how long other online forums have been around.&nbsp; While coping with the problems the website was having, I had computer problems of my own.&nbsp; It turned out I had an outdated version of Java, and when I downloaded the new version the old one didn&#039;t get deleted.&nbsp; It took me a few weeks to get that straightened out, and during the time when I couldn&#039;t get into the website&#039;s chat room I began to get disillusioned with the other women (it was all women, there) who were posting messages.&nbsp; <br /><br />They kept starting new threads with misleading titles, that all talked about the same thing - which crew member was the sexiest.&nbsp; I mean, how many times can you say that about a guy, especially one you don&#039;t and never will really know?&nbsp; These were women of mixed ages who lived in different parts of the country and had different occupations, yet they were stuck on this one thing.&nbsp; <br /><br />I noticed that the actual crew of the ship rarely posted anything on their own website.&nbsp; I tried several times to get the subject back to crab fishing or to something relevant to our lives, I tried being one of the girls and made a few posts about my own favorite guy and what I liked about him, but no matter what, they were stuck on the one topic.&nbsp; <br /><br />The moderator explained why certain posts were deleted - some women were going into details about their sexual fantasies about the guys and what they would do if they actually met them, and the mod felt this was insulting to the men&#039;s wives and children.&nbsp; The explicit posts would slow but not stop.&nbsp; <br /><br />The mod told them not to start new threads on old topics but it was all they did.&nbsp; I wondered what they talked about in the chat room.&nbsp; Finally I got my Java problem solved and got into the chat room, where I was greeted by one nut whose opening remark to me was f___ You!&nbsp; <br /><br />She irrationally went on in that tone and I contacted the moderator who pm&#039;d me to say that he/she had never been in the chat room but would go in to check the situation.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think the mod could see a log of what was said before entering the room, and of course this nut was not going to saying like that with the mod present.&nbsp; <br /><br />In my less disillusioned days I had gotten the idea to rally the women with a group identity and suggested we call ourselves the Time Banditas.&nbsp; Everybody loved the name, and I wrote to Andy Hillstrand, through the website, asking permission to use the name.&nbsp; He wrote back giving his permission and saying he appreciated me asking because so many other people/groups were using their names and images without permission.&nbsp; <br /><br />On the forum message boards I started discussing with the other women coming up with our own logo, since we couldn&#039;t use the ship&#039;s, and having tee shirts made.&nbsp; <br /><br />The website had a section for asking fishing questions.&nbsp; One day I posed a question and the mod answered back &quot;you kidding, right?&quot;.&nbsp; This jerk from the chat room and her idiot friends added their tee hee&#039;s.&nbsp; I was surprised the mod gave me this kind of response, especially in light of what I said about this nut in the chat room.&nbsp; I said no, I wasn&#039;t kidding, and why wouldn&#039;t the thing I was asking about work?&nbsp; I also reported the mod to the web-hosting company for being unprofessional.&nbsp; The mod then gave a really great, educational answer my question, and I replied with praise for the mod, saying that was the kind of quality answer I had hoped the forum would be all about.&nbsp; But soon after I noticed that the mod&#039;s answer was gone, leaving only my original question, the rude response, and the tee hee&#039;s.&nbsp; I thought that was really odd.&nbsp; I hadn&#039;t been going to website as often (I was getting disillusioned) or reading all the messages, but looking through them now I saw that the mod had asked for volunteers to help moderate the forums, and one of the women chosen was this little nut from the chat room!&nbsp; I figured it must have been her who took down the official mod&#039;s answer, leaving just the parts that suited her.&nbsp; <br /><br />I got good and pissed off at the Hillstrands for having this nonsense on their website till I remembered that no one from the crew seemed to be actually involved with running the website and rarely posted there.&nbsp; Then Discovery ran the episode that showed Johnathan piloting through dangerous blocks of ice, and the happiness in his voice when the ship was clear of it.&nbsp; I took this as an analogy for problems I had in my life and how if I didn&#039;t solve them it would be like being in that ice and that I would just sink to my death under my problems.&nbsp; <br /><br />I decided to redirect my energies.&nbsp; One of the things I stopped wasting my time on was that web group.&nbsp; Months later I went back to the website and found that many of the ladies had incorporated the name Bandita into their screen name.&nbsp; So, my legacy lived on!&nbsp; By this time, though, the women were posting things like &quot;gee, it&#039;s quiet in here lately&quot;.&nbsp; I noticed the website had a link to another website and when I clicked I found the other website had a forum, and all the women from the original website, as well as men, were posting there.&nbsp; It also had to have been an official website of the Time Bandit, since the link to it was prominent on their own website.&nbsp; Since that little idiot didn’t have sway on this site I posted a message saying that I had come up with the name for our group and that she can&#039;t change history (meaning she could delete my posts, but not change the fact that I had come up with the idea of giving ourselves a name and suggesting the name that was unanimously chosen.)&nbsp; <br /><br />A few months later I tried to get back to that site and it was closed!&nbsp; I went back to the original website and posted a question asking what had happened.&nbsp; The next day my question was gone without leaving any reply.&nbsp; I figured that nut was up to the same thing as before, I got good and pissed at the Hillstrands, remembered they don&#039;t run their site, and just didn&#039;t go back.<br /><br />So, the current tv season is progressing and I&#039;m watching the show, and I get the urge to look at the website once again.&nbsp; Only the link is taking me to a new website.&nbsp; I see a little news article written by a 12 year old who said two years ago when she was sick with cancer she started watching Deadliest Catch, her mother found the ship’s website, and started calling her The Littlest Bandita.&nbsp; I was thrilled that my idea had spread so far and was making such a big impact on someone else&#039;s life!&nbsp; I was also happy at first thinking the Time Bandit finally upgraded to another company, but disfunctionality and the mod&#039;s sig seem to indicate it&#039;s the same web-hosting company as their original website.&nbsp; I looked around and started reading a few messages.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t believe it!&nbsp; A few of these women were now putting &quot;Founding Bandita&quot; in their sigs!&nbsp; I posted a message to that same little nut questioning how she could be the Founding Bandita when I was the one who came up with the idea and the name!&nbsp; This, yes, this, is what has me saying &quot;GGGGGGRRRRR!!!!!!!&quot;.&nbsp; It’s really aggravating.&nbsp; Long ago I thought about writing to Andy letting him know that this little bitch who spoke that way to me in the chat room was now a moderator of the website that represents him, but as I said at the outset, it all seems too stupid for words.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />On the current website, what I said to that little nut case was part of a reply to an existing thread.&nbsp; I’m thinking of starting a new thread to out this little bitch and whoever else is describing themselves as “founding”.&nbsp; I still have Andy’s original reply, but I’m not sure it would be proper for me to reprint it without his permission.<br /><br />I’d like to hear other opinions on this situation. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />

				what are you hoping for? <br /><br />i don&#039;t think you can do too much about it except to let it go and look for other places where your input is acknowledged and appreciated. <br /><br />and if you are interested in marine life for its own sake, there are some really cool projects here in the city you can volunteer for - i know there is a group trying to reintroduce oysters into the hudson river, among other things. i think that kind of thing has more of the level of intellectual interest and maturity that it sounds like you&#039;re looking for - better than debating which guy is the hunkiest :) <br /><br />

				just about every person with internet access has gotten sucked into some toxic online communities. it&#039;s a very, very common thing. you&#039;re looking for new friends to discuss your love of proust and the next thing you know you&#039;re spending an awful lot of time being really upset about people you&#039;ve never met. <br /><br />when i catch my blood pressure going through the roof, i quit. a group that i belong to because i chose to should be about fun and learning. i have enough stress IRL. <br />

				Thanks to Enigmacat I did a search for Marcel Proust quotes and found one that sums up what this thread is all about:<br />&quot;Time passes, and little by little everything that we have spoken in falsehood becomes true.&quot; <br /><br />That&#039;s why I&#039;m not letting that little bit of flotsam get away with this.<br />
