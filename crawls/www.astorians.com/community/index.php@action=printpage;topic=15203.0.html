				It seems the issue Republicans are most passionate about is relinquishing power, whether in NY State or Washington DC.&nbsp; Albany politics have never been about what is best for the people of NY State.&nbsp; I gave up trying to understand it long ago. :-(

				I spent many a year living in third world countries. I am pretty comfortable now. <br />But any of you who stick to the party line (how does a scumbag like Monserrate get elected?) have only yourselves to blame.<br /><br />And to the OP, the single minded focus on a signature issue is truly the pathway to damnation. Being more worried about same sex marriage than the financial well being of the state is just another symptom.

I am not saying I would solely vote on this issue alone-but surely you can see how this single issue would be a bigger priority for so many. <br />You are talking as if one party is hellbent on bankrupting you-I don&#039;t think either party wants any more than the financial prosperity of all Americans. Riding the party line goes both ways, and I think accusing one side of &quot;bankrupting you through confiscatory practices&quot; seems like riding a singular party line issue to me.

				Outrageous.&nbsp; Should be interesting to see if they hold on.&nbsp; It certainly sends a strong message that awful people should not be elected to office - it&#039;s certainly time for Monseratte and Espada to go.&nbsp;

				Monserrate has been troubled for years - lots of scandal around him.&nbsp; He is a good organizer and has a strong political operation, though I think his days are numbered now.&nbsp; Once he committed the assault, I think it became only a matter of time before he is off to jail. <br /><br />Espada was a crook the first time he was elected and he is a crook this time too.&nbsp; He got ousted from office last time he pulled this exact stunt, though then it was just buttressing the Republican majority.&nbsp; He does not appear to live in the Bronx and only won because he has high name recognition and was well funded.&nbsp; He was also up against another crook - so either way voters lost.<br /><br />They were both lousy Democrts and should have been in jail even when they were caucusing with the Democrats.&nbsp; Hopefully justice catches up with them both.

You’re a father, would you give a s___ if the State of New York had something to say about your personal relationship to your child? Easy to say ‘single-minded’ when the laws work in your favor.<br /><br /><br />Anyway, this is really isn’t about gay marriage – it’s a giant pissing match between the boys to see who can control all the marbles. Reform? Taxes? It’s a joke because neither seems to tackled whichever party controls the legislature.&nbsp; It’s all about who gets to make the secret deals.<br /><br />Whatever, it’s disgusting. I generally hold the position that paying taxes is a duty and the price of living in a civilized society and I generally don’t have a problem with city taxes and federal taxes, but I have to say, The New York State government is a waste of money and everyone involved with it a joke.<br />

I would suspect nothing will happen in court that day -- day before a holiday weekend. Odds are he&#039;ll never see jail time. The girlfriend doesn&#039;t want to cooperate, so the DA&#039;s office will likely offer a plea deal down to a violation (probably Disorderly Conduct) and he&#039;ll walk away with a fine. <br /><br />Espada is a total scumbag. I was reading up on him last night and, yes, while he supports marriage equality, he&#039;s got his hands so dirty in a variety of financial matters that it&#039;s only a matter of time before he&#039;s indicted for something. My understanding is that into late May he still hadn&#039;t filed his campaign finance reports and that he had, at one point, been accused of illegally using campaign funds towards the legal fees of two of his lackeys who appear to have taken the fall for him when he directed funding for his health clinic towards his campaign. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know, but if I&#039;m a Dem senator on shakey ground in this political climate, I don&#039;t make enemies in my own party because I&#039;ll need their support when the sh*t hits the fan.

				It never fails, no matter what party anyone is in, when they switch, the side he was on who praised them for&nbsp; years, now&nbsp; say&nbsp; they were lousy &#039;bums&#039; all along?&nbsp; :lol:&nbsp; I think the term &#039;coup&#039;&nbsp; is misplaced.
