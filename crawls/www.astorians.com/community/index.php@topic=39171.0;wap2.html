			<br />Thought I should start a new post to make it clear that ...I&#039;m still looking to make some friends in the nabe! ;-)<br /><br />As mentioned, I&#039;m totally normal ;-) ....have plenty of friends outside of Astoria, and while they DO occasionally visit me here, it always must be &#039;planned&#039; in advance.&nbsp; It&#039;s not quite the same as having folks in the immediate vicinity to just say &#039;hey, what are you up to ...wanna meet for brunch...or drinks&#039;?&nbsp; &nbsp;etc.<br /><br />The older I get (I&#039;m 52 and have friends of all ages...younger and older), and the longer I live the solitary apartment life, the more I think &#039;Why can&#039;t people be real NEIGHBORS anymore?&#039;&nbsp; I mean, even in my small apartment building where I live, most of us are single, and every night we close ourselves up in our own private litte box apartments.&nbsp; Why?... why aren&#039;t we connecting with our neighbors more?&nbsp; Are we afraid of appearing weird?&nbsp; Or (gasp) lonely?&nbsp; What&#039;s wrong with wanting to connect with other human beings every now and then, even for just some simple conversation?&nbsp; ;-)<br /><br />I myself live near Steinway/Ditmars, but can certainly travel to other parts of Astoria to meet up.<br /><br />So let me know if anyone wants to start off meeting for just coffee or anything...<br /><br />Thanks!&nbsp;

Astortians site came up and the rest is..., well me here now :)<br />anyway, I am totally normal, moved here 3 years ago from living in NYC for 19 years. I am an artist, and art director for magazines and would to have a friend my age!! (I am 55) in the hood.<br />I also live right next to steinway and off ditmars. if you are still looking to meet new friends, e-mail me back. thanks<br />Tracy
