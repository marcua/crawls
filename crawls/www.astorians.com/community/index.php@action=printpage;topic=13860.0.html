				Hi everyone,<br /><br />I am pretty new to the area and I&#039;m interested in playing some basketball.&nbsp; I know I am probably too late for most of the leagues, but does anyone know if there are any indoor courts around Astoria where I could just go to shoot around or any that have semi regular pickup games that take place?

				Howudoin237, I am also very interested in some local basketball.&nbsp; Zogsports used to have a Queens b-ball league but discontinued it this year.&nbsp; Not sure of any indoor courts around here.&nbsp; Anyone else interested or know of courts?&nbsp; In any event, I would be up for playing outdoors once the weather gets nicer.

				Not sure of any indoor courts... maybe Astoria Sports Complex(?)<br /><br />I&#039;m close to Astoria Park and I know those outdoor courts get some good pickup games going sometimes.&nbsp; If we can get enought people together at the right time, maybe we can run some games there.&nbsp; Assuming the weather is on our side.&nbsp; 8-)

				I&#039;m interested as well, for as long as the knee holds up, which could mean I might be playing for 2 minutes...we&#039;ll find out.<br />Some of the courts on&nbsp; Roosevelt Island are the nicest around.<br />I tried to talk my way into seeing if I could &quot;rent&quot; the gym at Most Precious Blood but due to insurance policy they aren&#039;t allowed to do it, too bad.<br />Keep me in mind.....
