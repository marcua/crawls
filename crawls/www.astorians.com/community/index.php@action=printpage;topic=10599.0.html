				Hi all! I&#039;m moving to 37th st / 23 ave on Friday and I&#039;m looking for your best recommendations on just about anything in the area. I have poked around the forums and have a bunch of ideas gleaned from those posts (and found my fabulous broker thanks to you guys!) but figured it wouldn&#039;t hurt to ask about my specific area. I&#039;m in my mid-20s, single, and working in midtown, if that makes any amount of difference.<br /><br />Stuff I&#039;m looking for:<br /><br />-dentist<br />-chiropractor<br />-dermatologist<br />-orthodontist (I have invisalign on my bottom teeth -- someone familiar with this...)<br />-gynecologist<br />-veterinarian<br /><br />-yoga studio (I&#039;m very close to Dahn but heard I should avoid...I heard about The Yoga Room and The Rock classes - thoughts on those?)<br />-nail salon<br />-hair salon<br />-facials/massage spot<br />-grocery store (I think Key Food? I found Top Tomato...)<br />-laundromat<br />-animal shelter (Hope to get second cat in late June. I found Francis&#039; Friends, which is near me -- anyone adopted from them?)<br /><br />-great takeout -- I&#039;m open to anything except seafood<br />-chill bar/coffee shops I can feel comfortable going to alone (I&#039;ve got Freeze Peach and Sparrow written down already!)<br /><br />Apologies for the lengthy list. I&#039;d love to hear any and all things you have to say about people and places to try or avoid... ;) <br /><br />Thanks in advance!

				With the possible exception of chiropractor and orthodontist, there have been many posts on just about everything else you&#039;ve listed. Do some searches for that stuff here and let us know what you still need to know. Threads on each of these end up being several pages long, so a one-thread list of all those things will be fairly unwieldy.

				Welcome to the neighborhood, Sarah!&nbsp; I live just down the street from your new apt.&nbsp; You&#039;ll be in the neighborhood of the St Irene Chrisovalantou Greek Orthodox Church, which has unusual and (IMO) wonderful bells at various times during the day.<br /><br />Definitely avoid Dahn Yoga.&nbsp; As far as yoga studios, I hear good things about The Yoga Room on Steinway (32-32). <br /><br />You&#039;ll be a block from Trade Fair, which has some interesting things, though odd smells at times.&nbsp; Top Tomato has ok produce (not great, but decent) and is open 24 hours, which is very cool.&nbsp; Key Food is over on 31st Street by the train.&nbsp; Fresh Start on 23rd Ave between 29th and 31st is a good natural foods store.<br /><br />I go to SPAce (Ditmars by 29th Street) for my haircuts.&nbsp; I like Edna (I have an appt with her next weekend even).&nbsp; I went upstairs once, where they do the massages etc, and it&#039;s really nice up there.&nbsp; Like a totally different world from downstairs.<br /><br />As far as food, I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll get lots of opinions.&nbsp; Favorites in the neighborhood for me are Wave Thai, Golden Chopsticks (mediocre yet better than a lot of Chinese places), Zorbas (for Greek and general diner type food), and Michael Angelos for pizza (get the Sophia Loren).&nbsp; One interesting place nearby is Balkh Shish Kebab, an Afghani restaurant.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Their dumplings are good, kebabs are tasty, and they do deliver. I also order from Kumo, which makes fine sushi.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard good things about Sakura, though, a new Japanese place.&nbsp; I think a Brazilian place is opening up on 23rd Ave soon, too.&nbsp; Oh, and you can&#039;t not visit the Sandwich Kings on 23rd Ave near 35th Street.&nbsp; Total yum.<br /><br />Oh, there are some good things to be had at Soho, especially the whole wheat pancakes. <br /><br />I&#039;d recommend avoiding Los Amigos.&nbsp; I had, um, GI distress last time I went there.&nbsp; Yuck.&nbsp; Also be careful of the bird crap bridge on 23rd Ave.&nbsp; I&#039;ve not been crapped on... yet.<br /><br />Freeze Peach is great, and a new coffee place just opened on 31st near the Ditmars station.&nbsp; They will be open from 6:30am to midnight 7 days a week.&nbsp; Wifi is coming, apparently, but not there now.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />essen is right, there are a lot of discussions about all of this stuff.&nbsp; But enjoy the neighborhood!&nbsp; It&#039;s a great part of town.

				For a Vet, I like Astoria Veterinary Group, on Steinway just North of the highway. I don&#039;t much like the place on Ditmars and roughly 34th St.<br /><br />I adopted a cat from Francis&#039; Friends. They take good care of their cats, and place this with good foster families. Their adoption contract is the standard one for animal adoption agencies: fascist. You agree not to declaw the cat, not to give the cat to anyone else without the agency&#039;s prior permission, and about 300 other limitations. I&#039;m pretty sure there was something in there about their being allowed to use deadly force (against people) if they get even slightly suspicious. It&#039;s understandable, but obnoxious.<br /><br />Meg got most of the other highlights for this neck of the woods! You may have to learn to like seafood, though...! :)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=10599.msg129884.html#msg129884">Quote from: sarah23 on May 25, 2008, 10:52:55 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">-veterinarian<br />-animal shelter (Hope to get second cat in late June.

				Welcome to the &#039;hood!<br /><br />I can&#039;t make recommendations for any of the medical people (unless you want some in Manhattan) but for Vets I use Dr. Hatzi as All Pets on Ditmars between 35th-36th.&nbsp;

				Welcome to the neighborhood!&nbsp; You&#039;ll love living here.<br />I have seen all the Vets at Astoria Vet Group (one of my 2 cats has a chronic disease, so they basically can build a wing named after him)- they are all great, my personal favorite is Dr. Kamer.&nbsp; Our other cat (not the sick one) was adopted from Francis Friends.&nbsp; We had a great experience with them.<br />I can also recommend SPAce for haircuts &amp; decent color.&nbsp; I go to Rejuvenate on 23rd ave &amp; 27th (?) for massages and facials, and have been happy with them.&nbsp; It&#039;s a small space, but the massuese is great (Beatrix). Plus I beleive they only use organic products.<br />I get my fruits and veggie at the stand on 23rd Ave and 29th street- it&#039;s smaller than Top Tomato, but I think the quality is a little better.&nbsp; Fresh Start is great if you&#039;re looking for a Natural Foods option.<br />I like Watawa and Sakura for sushi, Wave Thai and Bangkok Tasty for Thai, Michaelangelos has great pizza, and Zorba&#039;s for greek salads and gyros.&nbsp; We love to go out for breakfast, and can usually be found at Igloo on the weekends for brunch (or Fatty&#039;s if we feel like a little something special).<br />I belong to the Rock, but haven&#039;t done a yoga class- I hear good things though.<br />So many great options here- have fun exploring!

				I can second, or it third, Astoria Veterinary Group, Dr. Kamer rocks!! And the others are just as sane and intelligent. I will also second the veggie place on 23rd ave, especially since our favorite other place (ditmars and 38th st) got closed&nbsp; due to landlord assoholocity. Watawa has consistently good sushi, but we also go to Kumo occasionally, Sakura is nice too. What else, oh yea if you want some great gelato (Italian Ice cream) go to La Guli on Ditmars between 31st and 29th. Rose and Joe&#039;s bakery, St. Honore a great little bakery that make absolutely the best butter cookies!! Across the street from Top Tomato. I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve seen the lines outside of Taverna Kyklades, a Greek seafood place. We have tons of places to go, Waltz on Ditmars and 24th, Freeze Peach on 29th and Ditmars.<br /><br />Anyway welcome to the hood!

				Welcome to the hood, though your priorities are pretty screwed up.&nbsp; &nbsp;You listed bars LAST!!??<br /><br />You&#039;re spitting distance from McCann&#039;s.&nbsp; &nbsp;(Ditmars, and 37th) Great staff, great food (for a bar), pretty good atmosphere.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				For a special occasion or splurge meal- Christo&#039;s Steakhouse. 23rd &amp; 41st St. Filet Mignon to die for, and not a silly NYC 4oz &quot;medallion&quot;. A real cut of 12oz plus. It is a bit pricey- $100+ for 2, including a drink &amp; dessert.

				Hello! Welcome to the neighborhood!! I also just recently moved here and I absolutely love it! I hope you learn to enjoy it as well. As far as recommendations for food go, I can agree with mostly all of the previous posts on here. All of the restaurants are good but I think it really would depend on what you like and what you are in the mood to eat. So don&#039;t be afraid to try everything because the choices are endless.<br />The Yoga Room is also a great place! I have been going there for a couple of months now and I think the people and instructors are really friendly. They really make you feel welcome.<br />Anyway good luck with your move!

				Thank you all so much for answering! This is exactly what I was looking for. (And I will continue to poke around the forum for more answers, essen, promise!) I&#039;m all moved in and don&#039;t start work in midtown until Wednesday, so I&#039;ll definitely be walking around exploring these next couple days (I&#039;m on the hunt for some windows fan, first off!). I&#039;m not sure of what my work hours are going to be like yet, but I&#039;m open to hanging out and getting to know people once I get my schedule together. Feel free to PM me. :) Thanks again for the help, I can&#039;t tell you how much I appreciate it.
