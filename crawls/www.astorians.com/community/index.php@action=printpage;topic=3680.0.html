				OK, I know this might not be the right place to post this thread since it is not &quot; where can I find in Astoria&quot;, but I really need your advise on this.<br />Since I am from Europe and all of my friends from there want to know all about how I am doing here and see the photos of USA and stuff, I decided to start a blog where I can write my kind of diary and upload photos and videos and then they can just go there and read.<br />The only thing is I have no idea about this topic&nbsp; :oops: and did hear about some sites like MySpace or Blogger or Geocities, but since I know that people on this forum are very familiar with this topic I would like your advise. Which website should I use which is the best one and why, can I make the blog only to be private - I mean I do not want the whole internet world to read my writings and see my photos, and by the way how secure this blogging is? I mean can people steal your info and abuse it in any way?<br />Please shed some light for me on this topic, I would really appreciate.<br />And also some advise on how to make your blog look nice and fun :-) <br /><br />Thanks so much,<br />Mima

				When I was in my blogging heydey, I was using Blogger. I found it very easy to use and I know in the past year or so they have made some improvements to their tools like uploading images. You might also try WordPress but I still find Blogger the easiest.

				Please, do humanity a favor and avoid the horrendity that is MySpace.<br /><br />I also recommend Blogger - I haven&#39;t used it in a long, long time, but from what I hear it&#39;s quite easy to set up.

				I use Blogger and really like it.&nbsp; There are more user-friendly permissions you can set up to let only certain users read your output.<br /><br />Wordpress is nice but sometimes seems a bit bloated and slow to load.<br /><br />Movable Type is great but not free.&nbsp; Even Typepad costs a bit.<br /><br />There are older things like Diaryland and LiveJournal, which are more like, well, diaries.&nbsp; I have one friend who has used both and continues to use Diaryland and likes it.&nbsp; They look very no frills.&nbsp; I don&#39;t really know what it&#39;s like to use LiveJournal.&nbsp; I haven&#39;t really read too many of them to know what they have to offer that is unique from the others.&nbsp; It&#39;s funny - the two LiveJournal users I know are both from Kansas!

				I used livejournal for a while.  It&#39;s sort of like the myspace of online diaries--very friend oriented.  I think Blogger is probably best.

				I&#39;ve heard that LiveJournal allows you to set different levels of privacy, which is a feature you indicated you wanted.&nbsp; I&#39;ve never used it myself, but apparently you can have entries that are public, or entries that only certain people can see.

				The new Blogger beta allows varying levels of privacy that weren&#39;t available before.&nbsp; It&#39;s a nice option for those who want/need it.&nbsp; mima, I think it would work well for you.&nbsp; Plus, Blogger blogs just don&#39;t seem so awkwardly private as I feel LiveJournal and Diaryland do (well, in the limited experience I&#39;ve had with my two KS friends), even when they are public.&nbsp; Less &quot;Dear Diary&quot; and more &quot;Here&#39;s something I&#39;d like to say.&quot;&nbsp; Good luck!
