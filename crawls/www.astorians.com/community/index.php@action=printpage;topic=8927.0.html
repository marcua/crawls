				The thread I started about my obsessive hunt for Fage tzatziki sauce, which is one of my crack addictions, got me thinking about what other people consider their personal &quot;crack.&quot; That food substance that for whatever reason you will go to great lengths to procure.<br />For instance my friend Michael refers to the fresh mozzerella at Heliopolis his crack.<br /><br />Mine would be:<br />Fage Tzatziki (as previously stated)<br />Dubliner Irish Cheddar from Kerrygold (not their other irish cheeses, just that one)<br />Chicken Francaise from Napoli (ok, that and any of their super cheesey pasta dishes)<br /><br />I&#039;m curious to know what other astorians are addicted to; I may find a new addiction in the process. As you may as well.

				Chicken Souvlaki from Ditmars Gyro Place. I actually check my cell phone whenever I order from there and make sure it&#039;s been a week since I last called, because if left to my own devices, I would eat it at least every other day. Also, I am trying to figure out what brand of tzatziki they use. I know they don&#039;t make it there (I saw them getting a delivery once), but I forgot what the name on the box was. I think it might have started with G?<br /><br />Also, I don&#039;t get it often because it comes in like a 6 pound bag, but the spinach &amp; mozarella ravioli in the green bag that you can only get at Costco. Yum, yum, yum.<br /><br />

				Hmmm, interesting. When you say goat, do you mean &quot;baby goat&quot; or is it a full grown goat? I know Greeks love to eat kids---it&#039;s the truth!

				Yes, I always loved the way Marie Belle looked, but could not bring myself to buy them (i was afraid they would be prettier than they tasted, and i guess they really are.) Two other places I&#039;ve liked for V-day or birthdays: La Maison du Chocolat and one I don&#039;t remember the name of. It&#039;s a restaurant as well a as a truffle maker and they make very interesting flavors. It&#039;s located in midtown on the east side if anyone knows which one this is.
