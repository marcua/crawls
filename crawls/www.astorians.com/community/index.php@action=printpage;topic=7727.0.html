				one of todays headlines on cnn.com is about how White House press secretary Tony Snow is&nbsp; leaving his job http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/08/31/white.house.snow/index.html (http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/08/31/white.house.snow/index.html) because the financial burden of earning only $168,000 a year is too great. <br /><br />Now, if someone who works for this administration can&#039;t support his family and feel comfortable about the future on $168,000 a year, which is about 8 times the official threshhold for poverty, how is everyone else supposed to be getting by? <br /><br />I understand he has health issues and will be dealing with a lot of overwhelming medical bills, but again, if having a steady job with health insurance and earning 8 times the poverty limit is not enough to protect you fom the uncertainties of a medical emergency, how on earth are all the people who don&#039;t have insurance, or who have crappy insurance supposed to survive?

				I think he really is stepping down b/c of the cancer, but doesn&#039;t want to straight out say that.&nbsp; Alot of times when someone has an deadly illness, like getting colon cancer again, you pretend that the illness isn&#039;t the reason as a show of strength to both yourself and others.&nbsp; Or maybe it is the money, cancer treatment is expensive even with insurance and he probably has a nice house with big bills.&nbsp; Who knows?<br /><br />I don&#039;t think the new girl, Dana, is going to be up to the task.&nbsp; She&#039;s no Ari Fleischer thats for sure.

Curious to see how the conditions in poverty have changed and what policies have helped.<br /><br />http://www.heritage.org/Research/Welfare/bg2064.cfm<br /><br />(http://www.heritage.org/Research/Welfare/images/b2064_chart1-lg.gif)<br /><br />Poverty is an important and emotional issue. Last year, the Census Bureau released its annual report on poverty in the United States declaring that there were 37 million poor persons living in this country in 2005, roughly the same number as in the preceding years.[4] According to the Census report, 12.6 percent of Amer­icans were poor in 2005; this number has varied from 11.3 percent to 15.1 percent of the population over the past 20 years.[5]<br /><br />To understand poverty in America, it is important to look behind these numbers—to look at the actual living conditions of the individuals the government deems to be poor. For most Americans, the word &quot;poverty&quot; suggests destitution: an inability to provide a family with nutritious food, clothing, and reasonable shelter. But only a small number of the 37 million per­sons classified as &quot;poor&quot; by the Census Bureau fit that description. While real material hardship certainly does occur, it is limited in scope and severity. Most of America&#039;s &quot;poor&quot; live in material conditions that would be judged as comfortable or well-off just a few generations ago. Today, the expenditures per person of the lowest-income one-fifth (or quintile) of house­holds equal those of the median American household in the early 1970s, after adjusting for inflation.<br /><br />...<br /><br />But the living conditions of the average poor per­son should not be taken to mean that all poor Amer­icans live without hardship. There is a wide range of living conditions among the poor. Roughly a third of poor households do face material hardships such as overcrowding, intermittent food shortages, or difficulty obtaining medical care. However, even these households would be judged to have high liv­ing standards in comparison to most other people in the world.<br /><br />...<br />

				Gee I don&#039;t have 2 or more cars, dishwasher, own my own home or many other things that many if not most of poor households listed here have. I wonder if one extrapolated these measures to those living by either birth, circumstances or even choice in expensive urban areas, would find ? Can one make 50 - 60K or even more be considered poverty line or below ? I know I don&#039;t feel rich by any means although I supposedly make a decent or at least half decent salary and worked steadily all my life.&nbsp;

				If my relatives and friends upstate are any example, most families in rural and suburban households have to own 2 cars because each person has to work, and the only way to that job is to drive.&nbsp; Cars, houses, tvs, etc. are all purchased through huge<em></em> loans and credit card debt, which they struggle to pay off, plus the food, gas, taxes on the house, electric, heat, etc.etc.etc,&nbsp; all on jobs that, far and wide, pay less than $15 an hour.&nbsp; They rarely get to vacation, and when they do it&#039;s locally, never abroad, and it all goes on the credit card.&nbsp; Money for social outings is carefully watched.&nbsp; And they are not considered poor by definition.&nbsp; I know that compared to third world countries, our struggles are nothing.&nbsp; But that doesn&#039;t mean, it isn&#039;t still very difficult to support one&#039;s family these days.&nbsp; <br /><br />I did find Snow&#039;s desire to quit for more money a bit insensitive to those of us without such pay, but then again, I didn&#039;t expect more from him.&nbsp; Look who he worked for.&nbsp; But also, I do not know what kinds of bills he has, and who am I to prejudge him?

				You can&#039;t forget, he had a very successful career prior to his job as Press Secretary.&nbsp; He did well for himself, was successful and was highly paid.&nbsp; &nbsp;He took a huge pay cut to work in government and is entitled to go back to earning as much as he can. I am surprised that he made such a reference in his announcement though.&nbsp; Surprising for someone who is supposed to manage the press.&nbsp;

				I suspect that if the cancer is as bad as was indicated when initially announced, Snow isn&#039;t looking to increase his annual income, because he doesn&#039;t have years. He&#039;s probably going to try and make as much money as possible between now and when he&#039;s incapacitated by his cancer, for his family&#039;s sake. Just speculating, but it&#039;s certainly a choice I can imagine making in a similar situation.

				Unless his wife is also working, $168,000 is not a lot of money to live off of in DC, especially when you have 3 young (I presume) children to support. Housing costs alone in the DC metro area (including Virginia and Maryland) ahve skyrocketed in the past 10 years. Like NY, $100K is pretty much a middle-class income in DC.<br /><br />Also, I&#039;m pretty sure that that position of White HOuse Press Secy is a political appointment, meaning that it doesn&#039;t come with any kind of civil service pension or retirement benefits.
