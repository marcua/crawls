				He was very good.&nbsp; I give host Ben Affleck and the cast credit for showing respect and being fair. Even though most&nbsp; back Obama, they showed class in way they acted towards him.&nbsp; McCain did not go after Obama, but poked fun at self (The double Maverick :-D)<br /><br /><br />Kieth Olberman spoof was funniest part of show.

				He was funny, but I think it won&#039;t change any votes.&nbsp; I liked how they had Cindy McCain participate too.&nbsp; The QVC piece was very amusing.

Without the tone, you can&#039;t tell if someone is serious or not.<br />I should have left it at &quot;You&#039;re kidding, right?&quot; And then you could have said, &quot;Yeah, I&#039;m kidding.&quot;<br /><br />BTW, I did think SNL was pretty funny.
