				Megc gives her warm regards from Washington to her friends on astorians.net<br />She sounds very happy amidst the crowd (estimated now over 300,000), and I sensed optimism and electricity in the atmosphere.<br /><br />She said that police presence was minimal from where she was at. Within an hour or so they will be going to the White House... Our House.<br /><br />Meanwhile, on CNN I'm watching Rita blow shingles off somebody's roof. Fox is enjoying a picture of a building that looks like a trashed out bar. They must enjoy it very much, because whenever I turn it on it's there taking up half the screen.<br /><br />I believe that the War on Iraq is a war of racism. I think that people who continue to support the occupation of Iraq are racists. Are the Iraqi people not capable of governing themselves? They seemed to be doing fine until we arrived. What is this arrogance that thinks that we can fix a problem of this magnitude? <em>We</em> are the problem. Oh, by the way, who helped Sadam to begin with so that he could commit genocide against his own people? Who funded him? Who gave him weapons? The British?<br />How different is this from sending 1900 troops (mostly children) to their deaths for an unjust cause?<br />Hey, if your racist, that's fine by me... just don't go walking around calling yourself a liberal. That would be dishonest.<br /><br />If you work as a waiter in a restaurant and you notice that the majority of customers who are rude to you are black, maybe you can forgive them and reflect that maybe that's what 400 years of slavery does to you. Where would America be economically without slavery? Personally, I'm seriously considering moving to a country that is a little more poor and a little more egalitarian. The comforts of home (T.V., hot water, air-condition, sound system, nice couch) are ceasing to give me comfort, when the prevailing atmosphere seems to reek of fear, lies, oppression and violence.<br /><br />And speaking of the British, by the same logic they were reluctant as well to leave colonial India. Brown skinned peoples are simply <em>incapable</em> of governing themselves. Now you have India. Now you have Pakistan. Both have nuclear weapons. Yea, British!<br /><br />&quot;If my child died because someone decided to drop a bomb on my building saying that they were helping me to write a constitution I would dedicate the rest of my waking life to killing those who were responsible.&quot; -Anonymous<br /><br />&quot;In order to fight the War on Terror we have created a training ground in the place of Iraq.&quot;<br /><br />Is the world safer? Are we more secure? Have we successfully defended our freedoms from those ugly foreign extremists who want to take it away from us.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">CIA Report: Iraq Is New Terrorist Training Ground.<br /><br />In a major new study, the CIA's National Intelligence Council says Iraq has replaced Afghanistan as the training ground for the next generation of &quot;professionalized&quot; terrorists, officials at the CIA director's intelligence think-tank said, The Washington Post reports Thursday on its Web site.<br /><br />Iraq provides terrorists with &quot;a training ground, a recruitment ground, the opportunity for enhancing technical skills,&quot; said David Low, the national intelligence officer for transnational threats, the Post reported.<br /><br />Low's comments came during a public briefing by the NIC on its report of significant global trends looking out as far as 2020. Within the 119-page report is an evaluation of Iraq's place as a breeding ground for the new generation of Islamic terrorists, an evaluation that represents a consensus among terrorist experts throughout the world. &quot;At the moment,&quot; said NIC Chairman Robert L. Hutchings, Iraq &quot;is a magnet for international terrorist activity,&quot; the Post said.<br /><br />Dow Jones Newswires.<br /><br />[13-Jan-2005, 15:24]</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />&quot;Americans are willing to give up even more freedom in exchange for security&quot;<br />http://www.newstarget.com/001116.html<br /><br />&quot;Half of Americans are willing to give up personal freedoms ...&quot;<br />http://www.courtaccess.org/states/otherresources/articles/personalfreedomsstudy.pdf<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><strong>&quot;Those who are willing to give up their freedom for a little temporary security, deserve neither freedom nor security.&quot;</strong>-Benjamin Franklin</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Yes, I went to the demonstration yesterday and was glad I went. &nbsp;It was good to see so many people out there raising their voice in opposition to the current government policies with regard to this war. &nbsp;The socialists were even out there demanding a class war, which was interesting. &nbsp;In past protests I've heard so much commentary about racism, that the bringing up the issue of class is an interesting change. &nbsp;I hope more discussion about class is raised in this country, because I think it needs to be addressed.<br /><br />There were a lot of good posters and messages in the crowd. &nbsp;Our 3-D doves were a hit! &nbsp;People loved them! &nbsp;Yay.
