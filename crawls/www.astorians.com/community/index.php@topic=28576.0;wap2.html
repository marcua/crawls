			A guy came in our building today (Steinway and 28th Avenue), knocked on the door, claiming to be from the NYC Housing Board (can&#039;t remember if he said board or commission). Anyway, he had a clipboard and was wearing a jacket with some sort of NYC patches on it and a cap, asking if our heat was on and working OK, and then also our hot water. Was about 55-60 years old I&#039;d say, African American. <br /><br />Anyone else had this happen? Not sure if it&#039;s legit. Thought it was a little odd on a Saturday at noon.<br />

			I feel like you live in my building around the corner as we have recently reported the landlord for a lack of hot water which finally was fixed 3 days ago. I&#039;ve had Housing followup before so it&#039;s not unusual. I&#039;m guessing that if a building wide issue has been reported, it&#039;s easier to find people home on the weekends to check the status. <br /><br />Also, that&#039;s how they are usually dressed. They should also have ID. <br /><br />
