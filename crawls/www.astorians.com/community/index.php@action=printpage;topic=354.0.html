				A group of us are getting together ideas on how we can petition our city councilman(woman) to do something about the incessant insanity-driving jingles that are played by the ice-cream trucks in Astoria (among other things.)<br /><br />Suggestions so far include:<br /><br />1. let them play the song once every 3-5 minutes<br />2. make them turn the volume way down so you don't hear the song for 10 blocks<br />3. ban them from playing the tune at all<br />4. make them use a &quot;bell&quot; instead of a computerized jingle<br /><br />please add your suggestions below. and indicate an interest if you'd like to be included in the group of people who will be contacting our councilman's office.

				Sign me up for the petition. &nbsp;<br /><br />My suggestion is to not have the truck come by after 8 p.m. &nbsp;In the summer, he's still traveling around the neighborhood at 11 at night. &nbsp;<br /><br />A few years ago, we called the company's manager and complained and as a result, the truck stopped coming by for a few weeks. &nbsp;There was also a long discussion on the L.I.C. message board about how to get rid of him, especially late at night but there doesn't seem to be anything that can stop him. &nbsp;[One man in Ct., a few years ago, came out with a baseball bat and beat up Mr. Softee but I wouldn't advocate that. :)].<br /><br />Anyway, sign me up. &nbsp;I'm on the ground floor, front apartment and he always stops right in front of my building for at least five minutes each time he does our block.

				(disclaimer: i just came back from class, i'm super tired, and this post will not be very orderly)<br /><br />i think this is a great idea and i'd be willing to help out as best i can (although it's finals time and i really need to do papers).<br /><br />first, things like this--- numbers are VERY important. <br /><br />if you have a lot of people interested and committed and willing to dress up and follow a theme actually go to the representative's office, that would be great.<br /><br />though i think it would be best if you go to the ice cream company manager/supervisor first. if they refuse to listen to you or outright deny that this is a problem, then you go to your elected officials and claim that this is a neighborhood issue, and not just a few people that are annoyed and prove to the elected official that it would be in the best interest to come to a solution/compromise.<br /><br />definitely, when you get your interested people, have a meeting to talk about how they feel about all of this. how does this noise make them feel? how does this affect their life? what they would like to see done. &nbsp;document it, and hopefully some of these comments can be made directly to the ice cream company/elected official. &lt;-- testimonials are very powerful.<br /><br />then go to that link that enigmacat posted up and find out information and stats about noise pollution. <br /><br />on a slightly side note, and b/c i just rode with one of these guys on the subway right now and am very disgruntled:<br /><br />NEXTELL FONES ARE EVIL! THEY ARE THE DEVIL! THE BEEPING IS DRIVING ME CRAZY! NOT TO MENTION THAT I DONT WANT TO HEAR YOUR STUPID CONVERSATION!!! CANT YOU LOWER THE VOLUME ON THAT?!

				The music from an Ice cream truck does not bother me very much. I know there are probably niose ordinances in place, no loud niose after 10 or 11 pm something like that. Maybe they can be made to follow that rule. Also, there is no reason why they should play the music while parked somewhere so maybe that can be worked in as well. The music they play unfournately is the way they draw in thier customers. They have been doing it for years. Without it they would go out of business. &nbsp;If we ask them not to play it really late at night or while they are actually parked then that should be good enough.<br /><br />What bothers me more living in a bottom floor apartment is the car alarms that constantly go off at all hours of the day and night. Some are so sensitive and go off over and over that &nbsp;feel like taking a baseball bat to them.

				I'd be willing to sign a petition.<br /><br />Another option is to file a complaint by dialling 311. &nbsp;There used to be a direct phone number to file complaints, but it's been pretty much taken over by 311 in the past year or so. &nbsp;If for some reason 311 doesn't work, you can try the City DEP at (718) 699-9811.<br /><br />I filed at least three complaints against the ice cream trucks on our block last year, with a result of at least one ticket being issued. &nbsp;A short time later, the most annoying driver (started in February; would come at 11:30pm) disappeared, and the truck was softer and much more tolerable. &nbsp;It seems louder and more persistent this year, but still not as bad as the worst.<br /><br />The story you get when you call to complain is mixed, though - one noise control guy told me that technically, the trucks are only supposed to play their tune once per block and not repeat it. &nbsp;Another time I called, and the guy wouldn't even take the complaint, telling me that they couldn't write a ticket for an ice cream truck. &nbsp;That, clearly, is not true.

				So who's going to write the petition to sign? &nbsp;And calling 311 to file a complaint is good. &nbsp;<br /><br />My experience with Mr. Softee is that any action against them gets them to quiet down for maybe a month and then they're back at it again. Still, it's better to keep harassing them than to do nothing.

				I grew up in Astoria and I can tell you that Mr Softee has been playing that song late into the night for over 30 years and personally it's never bothered me.<br /><br />Now, maybe that's because it's a little nostalgic for me; every time I hear it it reminds me of being a little kid, anxiously waiting for Mr. Softee to pull up in front of my house so I could get a vanilla cone with chocolate sprinkles.<br /><br />David

				Well, it clearly bothers many of us. I know that 311 noise complaints have been making an impact on the mayor's agenda. This is an election year and a perfect time to raise an issue like this. Our area is very significant in the election math this year.

				I think many of us grew up to the tune of Mr. Softee, regardless of neighbourhood. &nbsp;While some may find it nostalgic, others find it has evolved into an unmitigated nuisance.<br /><br />According to the Daily News (http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/275021p-235300c.html), Bloomberg's proposal to revamp noise ordinances would affect Mr. Softee jingles. &nbsp;Of course, there's a lot of opposition to the proposed revisions, but consistent complaints, either to 311 or to a City Council member, might have an effect when it comes time for the hearings.

				I think the place to start is to determine exactly what we want to accomplish and what laws are already on the books - perhaps there is already an existing noise ordinance that is not being enforced.<br /><br />I think what we want is probably an ordinance restricting noise from vehicles to, say, 10 yards in residential areas, including ice cream trucks, music playing in a car, car alarms. &nbsp;(i'm not big on distances, so someone else may want to tweak that number) &nbsp;Heck, I live across from a hospital and if the sound bugs me I wonder how the patients feel. &nbsp;<br /><br />Then we can back up our request with data on noise pollution as it affects property values, stress levels, quality of life, and anything else we can think of. &nbsp;Maybe there's a community meeting we can show up for to present the petition (that would be better than mailing it) and voice our concerns. &nbsp;<br /><br />But first we have to learn what's already on the books. &nbsp;Does anyone have access to this kind of info?

				Yesterday I wrote to the website I posted here previously to request support/ideas/materials. &nbsp;<br /><br />So there's a law about noise, has anyone else sent off for the copy? &nbsp;if not I will.<br /><br />What if we went to street fairs with a petition to enforce existing rules and maybe gave out sets of free earplugs and info sheets on noise hazards, laws, etc?<br /><br />this is from the site mrm posted:<br /><br /><br />HOW TO FORM AN ANTI-NOISE GROUP IN YOUR COMMUNITY <br /><br />Taking the Necessary Steps <br /><br />&nbsp;Get Organized: The noise in your neighborhood must also be disturbing your neighbors. Knock on some doors, speak to neighbors in the stores, and set up a small meeting in someone's home. Get yourselves a name, e.g. Citizens Fighting Community Noises; elect some officers, add some well-known names to your advisory board, secure a mailing address, and print formal stationery.<br /><br />&nbsp;Be Prepared to Do A Lot of the Work Yourself: You may find that it's only a few of you that will do the bulk of the work - expect that. However, you can always get lots of signatures on petitions to give the impression that your group is large. Remember there must be a We to battle noise.<br /><br />&nbsp;Take Advantage of Existing Community Groups: Some communities have block associations, local community boards or other existing groups that may welcome a sub-group on noise. You may be able to attach your group to this existing organization. In that case, the existing group should allow you to use their already formalized stationery.<br /><br />&nbsp;Become Knowledgeable About the Noise Problem, the Effects of Noise, and Potential Solutions. You will have to do a great deal of homework to be able to discuss the noise problem intelligently. Document the noise problem: keep logs of noise occurrences including time, date, and duration. You can also purchase an inexpensive decibel meter to measure how loud the noise is. Know whether there are laws that can be used to correct the noise problem. Seek out possible solutions. Remember you may end up knowing more about the noise problem than the public officials or enforcement agencies.<br /><br />&nbsp;Go to the Media: Publicize the noise problem. Create events to highlight the problem. Send out press releases to all the media, e.g. radio, television, daily newspapers. Don't forget the small local community newspapers that may give you more coverage. Work hard at getting publicity for the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;Enlist Your Public Officials: Your local public officials, e.g. council members or aldermen, will be more accessible. Enlist public officials in your efforts to quiet the noise and educate them about the problem. Ask them to join the noise group and add their names to your stationery.<br /><br />&nbsp;Discover Which Agencies May Be Able to Tackle the Problem: Is it the Police Department, the Transit Authority, the Department of Environmental Protection, or the Buildings Department? Write a letter on your impressive stationery to the appropriate agency asking for a meeting on the problem. Have representatives from your group and local representatives attend this meeting.<br /><br />&nbsp;Hold Community Meetings on the Noise Problem: Ask agency representatives, local public officials and knowledgeable group members to speak to the community about the problem and possible solutions. Publicize your meetings - you want large turnouts.

				I am on the phone with the NYPD as I am writing this post. &nbsp;I count upwards of 15 rings so far to our local precinct in Astoria, and it doesn’t appear as if anyone has any intention of picking up. &nbsp;I live on 14th street down by the park, and after more than two years of the ice cream trucks, the cars with modified mufflers, the horrible deadly music, the obnoxious insults from the tourists hanging out by the water, &nbsp;I am ready to declare war. &nbsp;I call them tourists because as soon as the summer ends the cars, the bikes, and the asswipes magically disappear and suddenly it’s a pleasant, safe, quiet walk by the water again. &nbsp;Frankly they remind me of some Modells’ version of the backstreet boys hootin and hollerin.<br /><br />Lets by some paint guns, and form an assault group to deface their cars and bikes. &nbsp;If we make it pricey enough they will either shoot us or not come back. &nbsp;Either way something has to be done. &nbsp;I do, however, believe there is a very compelling story for both the city council, residents, local business owners and property developers to support. &nbsp;That noise and traffic will continue to bring Astoria down. &nbsp;But most importantly, it destroys the family atmosphere, and the serene pleasantries that Astoria Park offers. &nbsp;It’s rare in New York to be able to afford to live close to a park right by the water and so it would be nice if we could all enjoy that experience year round. &nbsp;I didn’t read many of the other posts so I am probably repeating what has been said—I promise I will once I am no longer angry--but for right now I am ready to break out those police chains with spikes on them and reduce all the motor bikes passing by to twisted, bloody rubble. &nbsp;<br /><br />I remember seeing Mayor Bloomberg on the TV declaring shore blvd a quiet zone. &nbsp;The signs are still up. &nbsp;What a joke. &nbsp;This is starting to get close to election time for Bloomberg and so that means he has to be susceptible to some kind of political pressure. &nbsp;I will of course, sign any and all petitions written to do anything about the sound pollution, but until you make the pressure real for them then not much happens. &nbsp;Close to 40 rings and finally I was disconnected. &nbsp;The police in this area are too concerned with parking tickets and whistling at lovely women to be of any real use. &nbsp;.<br /><br />As far as practical suggestions, I think we should generate a letter that we write to the Mayors office. I think we could also generate a letter from a group of concerned Astorians that goes to the city council and all our major council people threatening their reelection if they don’t make a legitimate move to reduce the noise and increase the safety for people walking in and around the park during the summer. &nbsp; &nbsp;So I say to you all, fellow Astorians, lets shut the bastards up<br /><br />PS- The ice cream trucks are only supposed to play their songs once on a residential street then move on. &nbsp;I am thinking that slashing tires, eggs, or something else could also work in this case. &nbsp;Better yet we could find the dude who did the baseball bat thing and get him all hopped up on truckers speed and send him out to do our dirty work.

				hmmm.....<br /><br />i really hope you are taking out your anger by writing that post.<br /><br />but violence is not the answer. paint guns, slashing tires, etc.... that's not acceptable. and not very Astoria-like. <br /><br />i do support any forms of diplomatic and peaceful ways of getting the noise down. <br /><br />as far as elections go... noise pollution may be a little bit lower on each candidate's list, given that our current mayor has mixed things up really nice... (That's another topic for another day!) <br /><br />**i think there is definitely a lack of <strong>enforcement</strong> of noise rules. **<br /><br />i have seen the signs in the park designating a quiet zone, but how quiet can it be when there are people in the park, actually using the park? the playground, the pool area, the basketball courts, people playing soccer... all of that dribbles out to the other parts of the park. so, do you want more presence in all parts of the park, especially the quiet zones? more presence couldnt hurt anyone going to the park. <br /><br />so, let's continue to be proud Americans and kick ass Astoria Community members and keep Astoria the way WE want it to be. <br /><br />everyone keeps talking about doing this, that and the other thing, but i challenge alll posters of this topic:<br /><br />WHO WANTS TO STEP UP TO CONTACT THESE PEOPLE, SET UP A MEETING, VOICE OUR CONCERNS, AND GET EVERYONE MOTIVATED?<br /><br />BRING IT ON ASTORIANS!<br /><br />&nbsp;:lol:

				The more angered moments on &nbsp;my previous post were purely for the sake of hyperbole and to release a little frustration at the 30 plus motorbikes that were parked on my streets last night stopping traffic and the 40 unanswered rings from the local police. &nbsp;It’s pretty funny that you think slashing tires and paints guns are not very Astoria like, especially when I saw some people running around with spray paint cans writing fun little slogans like &quot;Stop raping our community&quot; on new building projects, and seeing cars shot with paint guns earlier this week. &nbsp; I also see one re two new cars with slashed tires every week. &nbsp;<br /><br />What is very “Astoria” like? &nbsp;Is it two shades of Williamsburg minus the high rent…a little less hipster for your buck with some real New York neighborhood charm? Wait, I will tell you what it is. &nbsp; It’s a place to live and while I live here I would like to fully enjoy the park and get some sleep during the summer.<br /><br />Hmm… the Basketball players, soccer players and people playing in the park make noise? &nbsp;Oh my god and to think I have been directing all my anger at the loud cars, motorcycles, and ice-cream men. What a revelation! &nbsp;Your point is irrelevant. &nbsp;I am not suggesting that a pure quiet zone be implemented throughout the park--however if anyone wants to start a petition to the airlines for a no speaking section I will sign that too--but wasn’t the purpose of the quiet zones to allow police officers to enforce a set of noise rules which they are clearly not doing. &nbsp;I suggest an increased police presence up and down shore blvd, and that they actually do something instead of sit there. &nbsp;And while it may be low on Bloomberg’s list of politics, he IS the mayor, and its only a small issue because no one has pushed it into a larger political framework from which it can take flight. &nbsp;I am sure Robert Pistilli who has been working closely with the city council to develop the Eagle electric factory and another factory in upper Ditmars area would be interested in reducing the noise on the street above the park for his future residents. &nbsp;<br /><br />Numbers are not as important as you think, rather the illusion of numbers is more important and actually speaking to the right people who have the ability to affect change.<br /><br />This morning, I saw an old man standing outside his house in the blazing heat handing out flyers about the proposed tennis bubble they are looking at constructing over the Astoria tennis courts. &nbsp;He wants to stop it, and is actually doing something about it. &nbsp;I am joining forces with him. &nbsp;So you can go ahead and be Captain Astoria all you want. You win. &nbsp;<br /><br />I just want some peace of mind. &nbsp;Have fun with Mr. Frosty.<br /><br />PS--I am sure Plato would find it interesting that he was being quoted on a wall in the midst of the cave..

				hey, no need to riot, your friendly neighborhood council member here. &nbsp;thought you might want an update on the softee situation. &nbsp; as part of the negotiations over the new noise code, mr softee agreed to install music boxes that would not play while in park, to not play the jingle after 9pm, and to play it at about half the decibel level that it is currently played at. &nbsp;obviously, this is not happening. &nbsp;i'll be posting a letter soon that i am writing to them regarding this. &nbsp; i am in favor of putting these restrictions into the new noise code (not adopted yet) for all vendors. &nbsp;however, since i am not mayor or speaker (yet) i can only advocate this on our behalf. &nbsp;any other suggestions are appreciated. &nbsp;feel free to stop by my office anytime (just leave the torches home - thanks)<br /><br />pete vallone

				Wow! I'm excited to see a council member join us in this online forum - it's really cool.<br /><br />I alsow wanted to express that I'm willing to support this kind of effort in any way that I can. If there are ways that we need to get the word out about reducing some of the levels of noise in our neighborhood I'm very willing to do some volunteering to raise awareness.<br /><br />I wonder if there's an interest in starting a noise-pollution group that meets once a month or so to discuss ways we can help our community become noise concious, and help Mr. Vallone have more support in contacting other community leaders and enforcers on this issue.<br /><br />This has turned into a great dialogue online already. To be fair, it feels like the Mr. Softee guys have tightened up their act a little in the last couple weeks - has anyone else noticed a slight improvement? I wonder if this is due to the negotiations?

				<span style="font-size: 18px;" class="bbc_size"></span>I think the best way to remedy the noise pollution issue in Astoria is to appeal to the politicians. &nbsp;They would then have to appeal to the police department to hand out fines or tickets or whatever they do. &nbsp;Presently, I think the law is that noises cannot exceed a certain decibel level. &nbsp;I haven't seen too many police officers using decibel instruments lately...have you?

				I'd just like to again encourage any Astorians that share my hatred of the insane levels of noises (motorcycles in particular for me) to take just 4 minutes and call 311 to complain.<br /><br />I really think we'll have a better chance if our local precinct knows that we do indeed care when hogs ride up and down our streets at insane noise levels and speeds.<br /><br />When they get on the line tell them you are making an illegal noise complaint and give them the intersection. you can remain anonymous as well.

				Was jolted awak this morning about 5 a.m. by a LOUD noise like a plane overhead or a jackhammer breaking up concrete -- a buzzing sound. It went on from 5 a.m. for about 20 minutes then faded away for awhile, then came back not as loud. &nbsp; <br /><br />Does anybody know what this noise is? It's not the first time. Is it a small plane near LaGuardia or what? Since it's happened before, I'm getting really curious now about what it is. Did anyone hear it (I don't know how you could have missed it)?

				Sometimes Big Alis (the Ravenswood Con Ed plant) spouts off steam for 20 to 30 minutes at a time, which can sound pretty intimidating. I don't know if you would hear it all the way over by Ditmars- you can really hear it from Roosevelt Island, and I sometimes hear it from where I am on 31st ave.

The other is that people are generally good and reasonable and you can get them to modify behavior best by approaching them reasonably and asking them to change.<br /><br />It might be the age old philosophical debate over whether people are inherantly good or evil.<br /><br />Maybe Nextel users don't relize how annoying they are, or perhaps they see it as a cool status symbol to go around beeping each other all the time, but don't see any harm in it.<br /><br />In either case I agree that there should be some way to show them that they are indeed harmful (at minimum annoying). Whether the most effective remedy be through legal means, or another approach has yet to be put forward in a concise way on this forum.

				[quote=&quot;merm&quot; Whether the most effective remedy be through legal means, or another approach has yet to be put forward in a concise way on this forum.[/quote]<br /><br />There is no way to pose an effective remedy. &nbsp;The &quot;problem&quot; is simply one of one's annoyance level. &nbsp;There are lots of annoying things in life. &nbsp;We all have sets of them. &nbsp;In many cases, our sets overlap in many areas with others thereby forming a societal norm. &nbsp;In other cases we just have individual pet peeves that bother only a small segment of society or perhaps even an individual.<br /><br />Mobile phone technology is really in its infancy and people are still exploring how to deal with it. &nbsp;There is no standard norm for any society yet. &nbsp;It will take years for those conventions to mature and evolve.<br /><br />You can't honestly legislate poor choices people make any more than you could legislate the obnoxious loud guy at the party away or two people sitting next to each other on the subway talking loudly and obnoxiously to each other.<br /><br />I'd propose that instead of trying to alter other people's behavior so much that working on strategies which help us control our frustration would be more successful. &nbsp;Being rude generally only begets rudeness from others. &nbsp;The only people shaming and rudeness affect are those who are inherently not rude but are making an honest mistake by forgetting one's surroundings. &nbsp;Those who weren't raised with the same sense of propriety as ourselves will not get the message and will probably become offended.

				I live on the corner of 34th ave and 29th street. &nbsp;While I'm a decent distance from the train I am 5 feet away from the trash. No big deal if the sanitation dept. makes some noise twice a week, they're doing their job, BUT, there is a woman that collects bottles and cans for recycling every morning from 7am-8am. She clanks and rattles so loud that I've been woken up with ear plugs in. I now find myself anticipating the grocery cart of hell clanking its way towards my refuse. &nbsp;I've confronted her (in my robe no less...hey it was 7am!) and tried to persuade her to change her route so that she comes around my apt later in the morning when I'm gone, but to no avail - she acts (or maybe doesn't) that she doesn't understand english. &nbsp;I've learned to deal with it, but I'm curious...does anyone else hear the &quot;Recycle Renegade&quot;? &nbsp;As for the ice cream trucks...my only question is, why do I only hear the gingle at 8pm at night? Is it a drug-mobile or something?

				Mine is a total PITA. I live on the first floor too and when my son was born she managed to wake him up constantly shuffling through my recycle bin. I don't think there's much you can do. They all try to beat eachother out by going earlier than the next person. Maybe you can move your recycle cans? Or.......... put the returnable recyclables in a separate bag and hang it on a fence post so they don't have to go through the can and make a lot of noise. I do that sometimes.[/i]

				Didn't read this entire thread, but something needs to be done about the motorcycles. If they want to hit the park en masse on a Sunday afternoon, all five hundred billion of them, fine. If they want to cruise the highways, fine. <br /><br />What I can't stand is how they sit at the light and rev their engines, and drag-race down Hoyt Ave. @2:30am like it's nothing. You can't even enjoy a stroll in the park without the souped-up cars and motorcycles trying to out-decibel each other.<br /><br />It's beyond inconsiderate; it's like being assaulted by noise.

				They &quot;rev&quot; and &quot;race&quot; down every major street in Astoria.<br /><br />Calling 311 and submitting a &quot;noise complaint coming from outside&quot; seems to work. They submit the complaints to our local precinct (114). While this usually doesn't solve the problem immediately it does show up on the Sargent's desk, I actually had the guy call me and say he had put a &quot;special interest unit&quot; on it some nights. If we can get enough people to call 311 and file complaints something will be done. This also gets put on reports that are seen by the Mayor and the Department of Environmental Protection. They are the ones that can make legislation that can change the rules.<br /><br />If you EVER see a motorcycle racing, breaking the speed limit, or being dangerous the most appropriate thing to do is call 911 and report a reckless driver. This DOES work right away as they send police to the area to check it out immediately.<br /><br />We need to all just take a moment and at least file a noise complaint with 311 whenever this happens. I do it quite regularly, and the sargent did say that the number of complaints has been rising so I know others must be calling and reporting too.<br /><br />We need to continue making this a public issue. It is pretty bad sometimes.

				I've done that several times; call 311 to report noise, but when I mention &quot;drag racing&quot; they switch me to 911. <br /><br />As much as I hate when they switch me over, it is more than just a noise problem. I think the police have responded once or twice- I've seen lights as a result, whereas noise complaints just get dutifully chalked up.<br /><br />I've even gone so far as to write to the officials in charge- it was a couple of years ago so I don't remember offhand who exactly- citing the noise ordinance etc. They were kind enough to respond in writing, but it was still a bit of a blow-off: &quot;We've checked the decibel levels on such-and-such a date and have determined that they're within acceptable levels....&quot; Yeah, when you bring out the meter at 1pm on a Wednesday afternoon, sure! &nbsp;:roll: <br /><br />But Bloomberg has been to Astoria Park and has acknowledged that the problem exists, so we have to keep up with the reports. I think we've made a dent.
