				Its a beautiful day today, cool, clear and crisp outside, just like 9/11 2001.&nbsp; Im feeling sad and down.&nbsp; Watched the French brothers documentary on 9/11 last night instead of the ABC show.&nbsp; Very sad and upsetting.&nbsp; Just like 2001, im home working on the computer and watching events on the news.&nbsp; Went out did some errands but feeling sort of useless.&nbsp; <br /><br />Everything is so political now and partisan and mean.&nbsp; I came away from last nights show thinking that this was one event (horrible huge and terrible) but one event. Look at all the life, effort, politics and money spent on this and so little has actually been accomplished.<br /><br />The other feeling I came away with from last nights show and todays events is a sense of love, power, courage and spirit in those who have worked to help each other just because we are all human. Maybe that is the best thing to hold on to today.&nbsp; 9/11 was tragic yet also showed the goodness of the human spirit.<br /><br />

				It is a beautiful day today.<br />I too feel a little restless, a little fractured.<br />In the complexity of the event, my most overwhelming emotion was that of loss and confusion.<br />I&#39;m confused as to why my government has chosen, in the wake of such destruction brimming with compelling human courage, to make our world less safe and more destabilized, polarized.<br />I try not to get bogged down by cynicism and pessimism today.<br />

				I&#39;m feeling sad, but not down, particularly.<br />It&#39;s funny how everything else that was happening to me in September of 2001 feels like 5 years ago, but September 11, 2001 feels so much more vivid. &nbsp;It&#39;s easier to remember it so viscerally when today&#39;s weather is so similar to how it was that day.<br />I think the main thing I took away from the experience was a profound sense of how much human beings can affect one another, for good and for bad. &nbsp;It&#39;s a big complicated soup, this human society, and it&#39;s sometimes a rough haul, this being human.

We will look to place blame and make sweeping changes, accusations. The compass that is our agenda may find a new magnetic north, but first we will have come together again and helped each other and comforted one another.<br /><br />All the while life will have gone on and more beautiful days will have come and gone.

				I&#39;m having a difficult time with all the media coverage and pomp that surrounds this date now.&nbsp; I get a sense from the rest of the country that it is a distant memory to many of them.&nbsp; They have no problems with all the movies being made, and docu-dramas, etc...&nbsp; But as someone who witnessed it, it&#39;s still very fresh in my mind.&nbsp; I feel a lack of sensitivity regarding this date.&nbsp; Particularly from politicians to use as election fodder to boost their poll numbers.&nbsp; Us New Yorkers experienced it.&nbsp; It&#39;s something we&#39;ll have to live with the rest of our lives.&nbsp; And most of us will have extremely vivid memories of it.&nbsp; I feel very isolated as a New Yorker today from the rest of the country, because I just don&#39;t believe the rest of the country fully grasps the magnitude of the events of that day and what it was actually like to be there watching those towers burn.<br /><br />But with that in mind, I also feel that it is time to try and move forward, in a positive way.&nbsp; To stop treading so lightly.&nbsp; Moments of silence and reading of 3,000 names rings hollow to me.&nbsp; Names just blend together, especially a full 5 years after the events.&nbsp; Perhaps we should do more to celebrate the opportunities that lie ahead of us for the memorial services.&nbsp; It seems you could simply play the video tapes from the last 3 years memorial services on tv, and nobody would even know the difference that it&#39;s not live.&nbsp; We have a tremendous opportunity to move forward, and instead of dwelling on the terrible day that occurred, look forward.&nbsp; It seems a more fitting way to honor those who have died.&nbsp; I fear that in 100 years, when all people directly involved and their children are all dead, we&#39;re still going to be reading the names of the victims and it will be meaningless. And each year they do the reading of the names, I feel it loses meaning, and with it, the overall impact of the date.&nbsp; As a city known for constant motion, I feel we&#39;ve shown a lack of it during these 5 years.<br /><br />Hope, love, desire, dreams, PEACE!

				Some sort of mixed feelings.<br />Before 2001, NYC felt very strongly apart from the country.<br />A very different cosmos.<br /><br />End of 2001, this city and the whole of the country, with much of the world, was a community that transcended politics and divisions.<br />Seems that was very brief.<br /><br />Do the great political divisions now mean that we are recovered to our former selves?<br />&nbsp;:-(

				A well-meaning friend not from here just sent me a video to watch in remembrance of 9/11. &nbsp; It was a compilation of all the footage from that day, set to Enya, so that we would remember that we were attacked and why we continue to fight. &nbsp;I appreciate the gesture, and know she didn&#39;t have any bad intentions in sending it out. &nbsp;I can&#39;t watch stuff like this. &nbsp;I was here when it happened. &nbsp;Not to be insensitive or anything, but I just want to get on with life. &nbsp;I prefer to move on, not keep wallowing in the grief that the tv and media stuffs down our throat. &nbsp;I won&#39;t even turn on the tv today. &nbsp;I would like to make the world a better place, a peaceful place. &nbsp;Reading 3000 names evey year and watching endless hours of the towers burning, where does that get us? &nbsp;There&#39;s been so much bickering downtown that we haven&#39;t even rebuilt much at all. &nbsp;Grief just seems so marketed. &nbsp; Moving on doesn&#39;t have to mean forgetting. &nbsp;I remember all too well.

				I&#39;ve been edgy for a few days now, not looking forward to this day; it still causes me anxiety.&nbsp; That, plus the stress of temping, is an exhausting combination today.

I looked uptown and then downtown, wondering &quot;could I have seen the towers from here?&quot;<br /><br />I was on LI when 9/11 happened, sitting in my studio going over music.&nbsp; I was only a little over a month in NY, just starting my doctoral work, and was finally beginning to feel comfortable so far from home (CA).&nbsp; What a way to start out the new chapter in my life.&nbsp; Even 60 miles away the tragedy seemed so immediate.&nbsp; I don&#39;t need to see it replayed on the TV, either.<br /><br />I don&#39;t know when I&#39;ll ever become comfortable with this date.

				9/11 was a strange day for me because I was in Tel Aviv, which in 2001 was hit by a few terrorist attacks itself, and I was in the Israel&#39;s tallest high rise for a job interview. I get downstairs where there is a small shopping center, it&#39;s afternoon Israel time and I&#39;m watching live on television on CNN what happened here... it was very surreal to say the least<br /><br />In the meantime I&#39;ve come to grad school in NYC and as a grad student, I worked with the FDNY Liberty project, which provides grief counseling and intervention for firefighter families. I was involved with the support project for the 9/11 families and I transcribed the intimate stories of several victim families. I know that five years later, many of the wives don&#39;t want to hear the memorial speeches or the commercial movies, or anything else. This day is hard enough for them, most of them want to be left alone and grieve in silence. &nbsp;For their children, on the other hand, the memorials have been a real booster, helping preserve their fathers&#39; memory as persons that put their lives on the line.<br /><br />Then, last year, I was working on a project with the OAG Healthcare Bureau. My partner from the project eventually described for me the havoc and fear of being in the vincinity ground zero on that day. Her personal story made it all the more real for me just how tragic this event was.<br /><br />I hope that the federal government begins finally to accept responsibility for all the other victims, those that continue to suffer from dibiltating chronic illness due to the cleanup in the aftermath of the tragedy. They too are heroes and they too need to get our praise and recognition.<br />

				I&#39;m also finding today more difficult than I perhaps expected to. And absolutely, I felt a vague uneasiness as I walked out this morning as thought automatically, &quot;what an incredibly beautiful day.&quot; Five years is a benchmark as far as anniversaries, certainly. I&#39;m sure that&#39;s another reason today feels harder. I&#39;ve spoken to my mother, had friends come down to my office to reminisce at work, and we all seem to be feeling this in a similarly strong way this year, and have found ourselves surprised by it. Strange, because I&#39;m ashamed to say, I barely remember last year. <br /><br />Yet, not only can I remember that day and each moment of it with aching clarity, but every day that followed it for a week and more. I remember coming out of the subway and standing in a doorway on Second Avenue and 43rd Street on Friday morning, (9.14.01) watching the rain fall, and for some reason, the rain, the torrential violence of it broke me down for the first time since the events took place. And the following day, 9.15.01, driving in to the city to bring in donations, etc. and being the only other car on 23rd Street and Fifth Avenue at 11:00 a.m. except for the fully armed military truck next to me at the light. Sitting there looking straight down 23rd Street with nothing but NJ in front of me. The chills two months later when the plane crashed a few feet from the home where my father then lived in Rockaway and thinking it was happening all over again and that this time I would not escape &quot;unscathed.&quot; As I am perhaps one of the few natives who did not have a direct loss of a friend or loved one that day.<br /><br />I can remember one month, two, six, and one year later, equally so. The next few, not so much. I suppose this is not so uncommon, either. I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s not meant to&nbsp; be callous, I certainly know that I sat and reconsidered the day and the events at least for a period of time on each of those anniversaries.&nbsp; But, as I said, today (and actually, this has been true for much of last week, as well), I am feeling a similar melancholy that I experienced in the few months after the original day. It&#39;s more acute, certainly. A part of that has to do (from a very personal perspective) with looking back and thinking, &quot;Five years is a long time. What have I done in five years? How has it all gotten past me like this?&quot; And the rest has to do with not only the scar of the day, but all the other evil that has come from this administration during that time.<br /><br />As far as not dwelling or not moving on, well, as I see it, I&#39;ve had plenty of good come to me since that day. I do not write the above to dwell on the morbid. I celebrate the good as often as I can every other day of the year and try to recognize as much of it as I can when it happens. I would do that with or without 9.11.01 to give me perspective. And yes, I will even do that today as much as I can. But to recall the events on the day they occurred, and allow them to remain powerful has nothing to do with not getting on with your life for me, personally. It is only when you let something like this overwhelm your thoughts and actions (be it 9/11 or any other personal strife) that you have ceased to live. <br /><br />So. Essentially. Yes. Sad. More than anticipated.<br /><br /><br />**********<br /><br />&quot;like tears in rain.&quot;

				a friend of mine lost her dad. she wrote this in a journal entry and this morning i read it and it really moved me. thought you&#39;d like a look. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><em>9-11-01, Five Years Later.<br />Remember September, remember September. I think I have grown tired of remembering, tired of living it over and over again in my head so many times. The day before, the morning of, the moment, the realization, the breakdown, the desperate and screaming phone calls, the ride home in Joe&#39;s car the next day, the cars in the driveway, the hope on everyone&#39;s faces, and then...<br /><br />And then. And then and then and then. I think I slept through the year. I delivered a eulogy, I wrote poems and painted, I sculpted, I made so much bad art that I almost lost myself in it. I wrote and wrote, and the writing was as good as the art was bad. I swallowed a lot of pills that never seemed to do anything other than have side effects. I spent a lot of time with Ghevf who became one of the most trusted people in my world and still is. He was there you see. Not a lot of people were.<br /><br />I look back and I remember. I look back and I see how young I was. There&#39;s nothing quite like finding yourself at the epicenter of a national tragedy to make you grow up fast.<br /><br />***<br /><br />I was reading Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close last week and I had such a visceral reaction that I got up from where I was, went into the studio where James was working and put my arms around him. &quot;I need a hug&quot; I said, and lost myself in a long, emotional hug, the kind where you leave spots on the person&#39;s shirt because your face is leaking.<br /><br />It&#39;s peculiar - most of the time, I cannot feel much of anything about it, even to this day. I reach inside myself to try and summon the sensation of loss, and all I find is a void. It&#39;s the biggest and most hollow thing I have ever experienced, just sitting there in my heart taking up space. It always takes some sort of outer stimulus to break through the hollow space and pull out the tears of grieving, and when the tears come, they are intense and sobbing. They are loud. They are extremely loud.<br /><br />I&#39;ve never been someone to repress an emotion, and I think this is the only area in my emotional life that has repressed itself against my will. Perhaps my heart knows what&#39;s best for me better than the rest of me. There&#39;s a certain frustration to it, though - and I don&#39;t like how uncontrollable the emotions can be when they are bursting through my seams.<br /><br />Watching footage is an understandable release. Reading accounts can get me. The aforementioned book really got me. The memorials usually get it out of me too, though usually because I look around at all the young kids and widows and parents and I want to cry for them. Through empathy I have found my own release.<br /><br />***<br /><br />In five years I have come to understand more about my mother than I knew back in 2001. Most of it entails a kind of grace that is something I have rarely ever seen. She kept on working and living even when she lost her partner of many, many years. She kept her grief private and never let herself become labeled as a professional widow. She endured. She kept her family close. Incredibly close.<br /><br />***<br /><br />I&#39;ll go to the memorial again this year, five years later, five years after the fact. I still miss him. He will never see the woman I have become, the woman he helped shape me into. I&#39;ll never know the details surrounding his death, who he was close to, who he spent his last moments with. I&#39;ll never kneel down at a grave where his remains rest because they never found a single thing that could be buried. I&#39;ll never, I&#39;ll never, I&#39;ll never.<br /><br />But I keep remembering. I remember the sunsets at the lake where he sat in his tattered Cornell sweatshirt, I remember his struggles, his accent, his intensity, his smile. I never knew what a good father he was because I never got to approach him as an adult, and he never got to approach me as one either.<br /><br />***<br /><br />Grace.<br /><br />***<br /><br />Everyone&#39;s got their tragedies, and this one&#39;s one of mine. I&#39;m ready to leave New York now, but I somehow doubt it will ever leave me.</em>

				The overwhelming military, police and national guard presence in Lower Manhattan (and in our subways) for the weeks after 9-11 still are very vivid in my memory. &nbsp;I remember how it was primary day, usually one of my favorite days of the year and I was involved in a heated City Council primary in Lower Manhattan. &nbsp;We heard the first plane go overhead and then heard the cries that the WTC had been hit, and sure enough, when we looked up, everyone stopped to stare in amazement and shock. <br />I was seeing a guy who lived in Battery Park City at the time of the attacks and getting to his apartment for weeks after the attacks took going through many barracades. &nbsp;It was so depresssing and surreal. &nbsp;I still find it hard to think about 9-11, the memories are too raw. &nbsp;Has anyone seen any of the films made about the day, or that wretched ABC mini-series? &nbsp;Watching the NY1 coverage was the first real historical overview I&#39;ve watched on TV and it brought back many strong memories.

And absolutely, I felt a vague uneasiness as I walked out this morning as thought automatically, &quot;what an incredibly beautiful day.&quot; Five years is a benchmark as far as anniversaries, certainly. I&#39;m sure that&#39;s another reason today feels harder. I&#39;ve spoken to my mother, had friends come down to my office to reminisce at work, and we all seem to be feeling this in a similarly strong way this year, and have found ourselves surprised by it. Strange, because I&#39;m ashamed to say, I barely remember last year. <br /><br />Yet, not only can I remember that day and each moment of it with aching clarity, but every day that followed it for a week and more. I remember coming out of the subway and standing in a doorway on Second Avenue and 43rd Street on Friday morning, (9.14.01) watching the rain fall, and for some reason, the rain, the torrential violence of it broke me down for the first time since the events took place. And the following day, 9.15.01, driving in to the city to bring in donations, etc. and being the only other car on 23rd Street and Fifth Avenue at 11:00 a.m. except for the fully armed military truck next to me at the light. Sitting there looking straight down 23rd Street with nothing but NJ in front of me. The chills two months later when the plane crashed a few feet from the home where my father then lived in Rockaway and thinking it was happening all over again and that this time I would not escape &quot;unscathed.&quot; As I am perhaps one of the few natives who did not have a direct loss of a friend or loved one that day.<br /><br />I can remember one month, two, six, and one year later, equally so. The next few, not so much. I suppose this is not so uncommon, either. I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s not meant to&nbsp; be callous, I certainly know that I sat and reconsidered the day and the events at least for a period of time on each of those anniversaries.&nbsp; But, as I said, today (and actually, this has been true for much of last week, as well), I am feeling a similar melancholy that I experienced in the few months after the original day. It&#39;s more acute, certainly. A part of that has to do (from a very personal perspective) with looking back and thinking, &quot;Five years is a long time. What have I done in five years? How has it all gotten past me like this?&quot; And the rest has to do with not only the scar of the day, but all the other evil that has come from this administration during that time.<br /><br />As far as not dwelling or not moving on, well, as I see it, I&#39;ve had plenty of good come to me since that day. I do not write the above to dwell on the morbid. I celebrate the good as often as I can every other day of the year and try to recognize as much of it as I can when it happens. I would do that with or without 9.11.01 to give me perspective. And yes, I will even do that today as much as I can. But to recall the events on the day they occurred, and allow them to remain powerful has nothing to do with not getting on with your life for me, personally. It is only when you let something like this overwhelm your thoughts and actions (be it 9/11 or any other personal strife) that you have ceased to live. <br /><br />So. Essentially. Yes. Sad. More than anticipated.<br /><br /><br />**********<br /><br />&quot;like tears in rain.&quot;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Absolutely.&nbsp; My idea is not to forget, and just put it behind us.&nbsp; I don&#39;t think this is the kind of thing you can ever just put behind you.&nbsp; I&#39;m trying to use the memory of those events as a way to propel me to better things.&nbsp; As a starting point, in a way.&nbsp; With great tragedy can also arise great potential.&nbsp; I&#39;ve written some music with that in mind.&nbsp; But again, I didn&#39;t lose anyone directly in those attacks.&nbsp; I did witness the attacks, but didn&#39;t lose anyone.&nbsp; But it&#39;s interesting how I personified the Towers.&nbsp; When those buildings fell, I felt like I watched 2 people get cut down that were close to me.&nbsp; I worked a block away from the trade center for a couple years, and actually lived a block south of the trade center the year before the attacks.&nbsp; I would go to the plaza between the towers on almost a daily basis to eat lunch.&nbsp; And with the loss of the towers, it felt similar to losing a loved one, as I&#39;ve experienced.<br /><br />I&#39;m not quite sure how I feel today.&nbsp; Somewhat numb.&nbsp; Somewhat frustrated by not achieving as much as I wanted to.&nbsp; Frustrated by the idea that maybe I&#39;m not living my life as fully as I could, or should.&nbsp; Frustrated by not taking advantage.&nbsp; Advantage of the opportunities that life in the city provide.&nbsp; Advantage of the opportunity to tell my family and friends that I love them and how much they mean to me.&nbsp; It&#39;s as though life is a gift, and I don&#39;t feel entirely like I&#39;ve unwrapped it yet.&nbsp; And this day is just a reminder of that.

				I didn&#39;t yet live in New York on 9/11. (I moved here on the day after the blackout, which is an actually funny story!) I was in Urbana, IL, which is a long way from New York City in many many ways. I woke up, heard something on the radio about a plane crashing into a building, recalled that a plane had once hit the Empire State building, and thought little of it. I went to class (Zulu!), where everything was normal, and walked up to work afterwards. Only then, hearing from my officemate Scott that the towers had fallen, and seeing the absolute gridlock on the Internet, did I realize the scale of what had happened. <br /><br />I lived in a brand new co-op then, which had two big effects on my experience of the event. One was that we had a hugely important meeting that evening. We&#39;d been up and running for all of three weeks, and the general manager of the organization that helped us buy the house was driving down from Ann Arbor, MI. (Poor guy spent all day driving the interstate with the radio tuned to the news.) We had our meetings as normal, and somewhere there&#39;s a photo of the new members of the co-op sitting at the table for dinner on 9/11, smiling somewhat unhappily at the camera. So in some sense my experience of 9/11 was a little overshadowed by my personally being so busy that day and the following couple of days. The second big effect of living in the co-op is that we had no television. I paid very close attention to the news, read the NYT online and so forth. But we didn&#39;t have a TV (being a hippie commune and all), and there weren&#39;t many videos on the Internet in 2001. So although I saw lots of pictures, I never saw the video of the second plane hitting. In fact, my recollection is that the first time I saw that video footage, that 90% of the US saw that day, and that some of you saw with your own eyes, was in Michael Moore&#39;s Bowling for Columbine the following Spring, perhaps six months later.<br /><br />My experience with this anniversary is also different. Part of it, perhaps, is that it&#39;s the 5th anniversary, and not the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th. But I think the bigger reason why is because I have a much stronger connection to the city now. I only knew one person in NYC on 9/11. (His email back to me that day said, if I recall, &quot;M&#39;ok.&quot;) Now I know hundred of people here and I feel like a New Yorker in at least some ways. It&#39;s a little like marrying into a family that lost a sibling a few years back, and having it be my adopted family now too that&#39;s recovering... <br /><br />Go see some music, y&#39;all...

				Two things happened to me since 9/11 that have deeply shaded how I see that day.&nbsp; Both are deaths -- of one of my parents and a close friend, in 2003 and 2004.&nbsp; Both of which brought home a sense of personal loss I didn&#39;t understand back on 9/11/01.&nbsp; And both of which put that day in a different context for me.&nbsp; When you lose someone in your life, it doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s some awful world event like 9/11 or just a parent quietly passing away on a hospital bed.&nbsp; It&#39;s like getting shot through the heart, and you carry that with you the rest of your days.<br /><br />At that time, the events of 9/11 had a profound effect on me, mainly in terms of grief and anger.&nbsp; But I can see now, the simple passing of two people close to me registered so much more.&nbsp; And no one&#39;s going to mourn these two people who passed, save for the people who knew and loved them.&nbsp; In the grand scheme of things, that&#39;s all that makes sense and matters to me now.&nbsp; And that is in no way meant to disparage anyone who still feels deeply hurt over that day.<br /><br />You live with these things, and you walk on.&nbsp; Death and dying are the hardest things we&#39;ll all deal with one day, if we already haven&#39;t. My memories of 9/11 now are associated with seeing that stuff go down with my own two eyes, running like hell at various points, coming over the 59th Street Bridge to see Peter Vallone, Sr. handing out water, walking through Astoria on a beautiful, sunny day, and feeling like I was on another planet as the streets were bare, and this made no sense compared to what I had just seen across the river.<br /><br />But in all honesty, that&#39;s a lot easier for me to deal with now than these two far more private things that happened in the following years, and which let me know there are more of these sort of emotional jolts to come in the future that I&#39;ll be ready for.&nbsp; In all honesty, I&#39;m glad that day is slowly receding in my rear view mirror and hope a day like that never happens again.

				This was a beautiful thread to come home to today.&nbsp; I know I&#39;m not a New Yorker, and really I&#39;m just passing through, but this day is significant for me because it showed me that people will come together in a crisis to help each other heal.&nbsp; I was here on vacation during the attacks.&nbsp; I got to see how such a tragedy could at once destroy and strengthen an entire city.&nbsp; This day is close to my heart because of how deeply it affected me and changed my views of the world.&nbsp; I always felt that because I live in America, I&#39;m safe.&nbsp; 9/11 shattered that calm.&nbsp; <br /><br />On my way home from work today I walked up Broadway through Times Square and past the theaters.&nbsp; It reminded me of the day after the attacks, when Broadway was empty and lined with candles.&nbsp; It reminded me of walking down 5th Avenue and seeing columns of smoke instead of those powerful buildings.&nbsp; This is certainly not just any other day in New York.&nbsp; I felt it as soon as I woke up today.&nbsp; There is sorrow, certainly, because so many lives were ruined.&nbsp; But on such a gorgeous, perfect day, I can feel hope in the air, a city rebuilding, it&#39;s residents healing, and I can&#39;t describe how proud I am to live here.&nbsp; New York is a place unlike any other, and rising above the horror, thriving on the desire to repair and protect, it proves its greatness and the greatness of its populace.&nbsp; <br /><br />I feel so fortunate to, five years later, be living in this city which taught me so much about life and myself.&nbsp; This is a very special place.&nbsp; All my memories here (even the bad ones) are precious.&nbsp; I am most thankful for my new friends here. Long after I leave New York, I will remember all the kindness and friendship generously given to me.&nbsp; I&#39;m a better person having you all in my life.&nbsp; Thanks to all of you.&nbsp;

				Excellent picture, erpotown.&nbsp; I had forgotten that on my vacation here 5 years ago, we took a trip to the World Trade Center and spent a good couple hours at Tower 2 on September 10th, around 4 pm.&nbsp; The very top observation deck was closed because of the rain, but we were able to take some great pictures from the indoor deck.&nbsp; I&#39;m so glad I got to visit the buildings before it happened.&nbsp; I wanted to go down to the site this afternoon to pay my respects, but I didn&#39;t think I could handle it.&nbsp; My walk up Broadway was good.&nbsp; <br /><br />I hope all of you are feeling better now that the day is almost over.&nbsp; This will always be a special, tragic day.&nbsp; I think the weather was so gorgeous today to spite the perpetrators.&nbsp; They didn&#39;t win.

				My new job is on the corner of Liberty and Broadway and last week I noticed something while I was standing outside (supporting my bad habit). I usually stand just inside Liberty Park and face Broadway while I smoke and I noticed that almost every person who passes that corner looks toward Ground Zero. I didn&#39;t pay attention at first, then I noticed obvious non-NY&#39;ers doing it but then I realized regular, eyes-to-the-ground NY&#39;ers were doing it too. Maybe it&#39;s just because today was so close, but I&#39;m going to keep watching. Just an observation. <br /><br />It&#39;s been hard for me to walk past there every day going to work and not look towards where the towers should be and think about what it must have been like that day. It makes me very sad. We could hear the bells all day in our offices and everyone was very somber. <br /><br />Today is also my best friend&#39;s birthday. Last year I wasn&#39;t here on 9/11 because I went back to Texas to surprise her for her 30th. So even though this is my second year in NYC it&#39;s only my first time to be here on September 11.<br /><br />I loved reading everyone&#39;s posts, even though most of them made me cry.<br /><br />I&#39;m glad I know y&#39;all. In this short time you have left a mark on my heart and I can&#39;t imagine NOT knowing y&#39;all. I won&#39;t get too sappy here, but next time you see me, remind me to tell you how great I think you are!&nbsp; :-)

				I wasn&#39;t going to read this thread today, but I&#39;m really glad I did. I would describe myself as a pretty emotional person - wear my heart on my sleeve and such - but for such an emotional person, I&#39;m really good at finding ways to avoid and repress it. So that&#39;s one reason why I was avoiding it. The other is that, this is just one of those things about being a New Yorker that I can&#39;t really share with the people who were here on that day. I&#39;ve spoken with a few people about it, about what it was like, but always feel awkward doing so. I can&#39;t imagine living through something like that, can&#39;t even begin to put myself in your shoes, or in the shoes of those that lost people they knew and loved.<br /><br />Therefore, in all honesty, I&#39;ve avoided a lot of things that might trigger the sadness. I won&#39;t watch the movies or the specials on TV. Won&#39;t dwell. But reading this was good. It reminds me that I can still be affected by it. It&#39;s like a pin prick. Yes, it&#39;s still there, inside me. I hope I always feel that sting.

				Media and public commemoration of 9/11 seems to be centered so much on the deceased.&nbsp; Not that we should forget them, but I&#39;m glad that this thread is about life.

				I really appreciated reading everyone&#39;s articulate comments in this thread. I was taken aback by how sad I felt today, more so than in previous years - felt like a general sadness in the air. Don&#39;t want to write much about it, but it&#39;s nice to read this and end the day feeling a little more optimistic and hopeful.
