			Thanks for response, angela1969 / Eamonn.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />I have been informed for the possibility of a one-bedroom w/balcony.&nbsp; Will be checking it out. Yes, I even forgot I applied &quot;years&quot; ago.<br /><br /><br />Soo what is the change that is not good?&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />As far as the walk to the train, right now it&#039;s takes me about 7minutes to walk to the Ditmars Station.&nbsp; I see that the #7 goes Express during rush hours from 61st Woodside to QBP, which is good&nbsp; :smiley: .&nbsp; &nbsp;Right now it&#039;s apprx 12 minutes or so from Ditmars/QBP.[size=78%] [/size]<br />[/size]<br />[/size][size=78%]C&#039;iao for now ~[/size]

			Woodside has changed considerably over the past 30 years. From mainly Irish American, to a massive influx of Irish from Ireland, to a rapid multicultural mix, to what could be a hipster haven. A lot of old timers lament the changes. I agree certain things have changed for the worse but I am optimistic. For examples of bad trends, the areas around Roosevelt to Queens Blvd east of 65th Pl have goten quite rundown. I think it will turnaround soon.

			Greetings of 2017 to All ~<br /><br /><br />So I went to view the offer .. now, decision has to be made quickly.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Pro&#039;s?&nbsp; the monthly would be half of rent what I pay now and includes everything; it is affordable for to purchase the aprtment.&nbsp; Besides the #7 the Q60 is close by as well the M/R, however that&#039;s a 15 minute walk.<br /><br /><br />Con?&nbsp; LR/BdRm smaller than what i have now and would have to make adjustments.&nbsp; I would also leave Astoria with a heavy-heart.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;:embarrassed:&nbsp; what to do what to do.&nbsp; Enlighten me ~&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;C&#039;iao for now ~

			This is obviously a very personal decision but if you really like Astoria, I would not consider this move. That part of Woodside is just far enough from the fun stuff of Astoria that it might as well be 10 miles away. The immediate area just doesn&#039;t offer a lot for walking around, browsing stores, etc. Savings won&#039;t seem that important once you realize you are spending so much more time at home because things are not convenient. I would stay put.

			Eamonn ~&nbsp; &nbsp; Correct, a personal decision and just wanted the opinion from here.&nbsp; Your point is well-taken.<br /><br /><br />Thank you for the reply.<br /><br /><br />C&#039;iao for now ~
