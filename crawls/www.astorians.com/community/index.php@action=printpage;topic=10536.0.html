				warning: slightly sappy story ahead.<br /><br />A child melted me into a puddle of joy on Sunday.<br /><br />I was dogsitting this weekend, and I’ve realized that dogs don’t belong to their owners, they belong to the world. But that&#039;s a different post.<br /><br />Clementine (the bulldog I was dog sitting) is well-loved by adults and children alike, and so I purposely hang out on benches so she can make people happy. So I was sitting and a family with kids came over and wanted to pet Clementine. A girl of maybe four calmly approached Clemmie, and petted her nicely. She looked over to me, and just as calmly came over to me, and in a way started petting me! She stood right next to me, and started playing with my earrings. Her parents started to tell her NO but I shook me head and mouthed “it’s ok.” Soon she was playing with my red hair, and just viewing me so intently. She was so curious, so unafraid, so pure, and in that moment, I loved her. I would have hugged and her she would have hugged me back but I’m sure her parents would have thought it weird, but she and I wouldn’t have. Why can’t we as adults have such innocence and trust between us?<br /><br />I hope her parents treasure her.<br /><br />Had the opposite thing happen later that day, I was trying to take the elevator downstairs to walk Clemmie, and some kids were filling it up with some bags, and their two dogs in carriers (obviously going on a trip). I tried asking them questions about their dogs, but they didnt&#039; want to answer me (Clemmie was hurt that they didn&#039;t even try to pet her!). I saw why just a few minutes later, their mom comes racing down the hall and tells them to &quot;take the bags out of the elevator!!&quot; I offered to just help them unload downstairs, but she just ignored my offer (and me). Such a contrast between parents who teach their kids (whether by word or example) that people are nice and parents that teach their kids not to interact with strangers.

				&nbsp;:-)<br /><br />&nbsp;:-(&nbsp; It&#039;s sad that our society has gotten into such a state that we have to be wary of all strangers, don&#039;t get involved, don&#039;t look, mind our own business...<br /><br />&nbsp;:-) And then a little kid reminds us that we aren&#039;t meant to be that way!<br /><br />(http://www.northalabama.net/images/BulldogPuppy.jpg) <br /><br />The only people who don&#039;t love bulldogs have never met a bulldog. <br />&nbsp;<del>Or have been bitten by one.</del><br />

				STRANGER DANGER!!!<br /><br />I hate it - it&#039;s taught in school like &quot;JUST SAY NO&quot; was taught in the 80s.&nbsp; The ridiculous part of it is that most kids who are harmed by adults are harmed by a friend or family member - It&#039;s rare that a stranger is a real threat.&nbsp; <br />

I can&#039;t stop playing with him and making stupid baby voices at it.
