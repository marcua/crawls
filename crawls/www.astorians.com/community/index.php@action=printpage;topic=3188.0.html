				Hey all, with all the talk about the button going on i decided why not get one out there for the masses!?!?!?!<br /><br />Mind you these are not &quot;official&quot; to the astorians site, just similar ones that i make no money on, just putting them up for anyone interested. i bought a ten pack for myself and figured while its up there, others may be interested.<br /><br />I think it would just be cool to start spotting these guys all over the nabe. And once the astorians.com stuff starts coming out there will be NO excuse to not be stylin!<br /><br />http://www.cafepress.com/astoriabutton (http://www.cafepress.com/astoriabutton)<br /><br />...&nbsp; :-D<br />

				I got my I &lt;3 Astoria pins in this morning&#39;s mail delivery. I put one on the strap of my purse, and I hung one on a little chain on my rearview mirror. Guess what? Okay, give up? I took my car to the shop today for a minor repair and I met another Astorian who recognized the pin on my rearview mirror! How exciting is that! They&#39;re small and unobtrusive—which I love. <br /><br />I promised someone one of mine when I posted that I had ordered the 10-pack. But I don&#39;t remember who it was.
