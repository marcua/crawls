				You should upload an mp3 of your song so we can hear it... I just get no satisfaction out of reading lyrics to songs without actually hearing the song, since they&#39;re so out of context. If you posted this as poetry, then I could see the point.. What I mean to say is, get a soundclick.com account and stream us the entire thing, then there will be the opportunity to properly critique it.<br /><br />

				I don&#39;t write music, just write.<br /><br />Took after my Dad in regards to the writing.&nbsp; He used to recite poetry in the late 60&#39;s, early 70&#39;s.&nbsp; Performed in Carnegie Hall, Madison Square Garden, he was offered a part in the Valachi Papers (which he turned down because he had to travel to Italy).<br /><br />Sooooooo, read it poetry then and thank you for the critique.

				Thank God, No.&nbsp; I feel bad for the families that have a loved one over there.&nbsp; It&#39;s such a senseless war.&nbsp; :cry:<br /><br />He had to leave to take care of his father who&#39;s very ill after the chemo treatments.&nbsp; We don&#39;t know what the length of time will be that he&#39;s gone, depends on a) whether his Dad gets better; b) whether he can convince his Dad to come back to the U.S. for treatment; or c) we don&#39;t want to think about this one.&nbsp; He does call me almost every day but ...... you know, it&#39;s not the same.
