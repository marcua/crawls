				Hi all -- <br /><br />We&#39;re just writing briefly to announce that our website has gone live, and that we&#39;re now accepting sign-ups for the upcoming season! You can check out the new website at our new address: http://www.hellgatecsa.com (http://www.hellgatecsa.com)<br /><br />There&#39;s a couple things you should be aware of going into the new season. First, we&#39;ve changed out distribution point for the season in order to be more centrally located for a majority of our members. We are now distributing out of the Freeze Peach cafe (full directions on our website.) We&#39;ve also changed our name from RavenswoodCSA, to Hellgate CSA as this more appropriately reflects our new location.<br /><br />We&#39;re also excited to announce that above and beyond the normal vegetable share that farmer Bill has agreed to offer both a &quot;tomato share&quot;, a &quot;honey share&quot;, and a &quot;flower share&quot; this year. We&#39;ve also extended the lenght of the share and will begin distribution the first week of June.&nbsp; Full details are on our website.<br /><br />We&#39;ve also added the ability to sign up online (no paperwork!), pay with credit cards for your share, or the option to make payments throughout the season. You can also sign up to get our online newsletter, or check out the blog. There are also pictures of last year&#39;s shares to give you an idea of what to expect.<br /><br />Take a moment and check out the new site, and if you have any questions don&#39;t hesitate to send us an email.<br /><br />We look forward to hearing from you.<br /><br />You&#39;ll be hearing from us again soon.&nbsp; Take the time to sign up for your share in the Hellgate CSA today!<br /><br />cheers,<br />- jayme (&amp; the Hellgate CSA core group)

				Cool, lookin&#39; forward to this! One suggestion -- does your farmer have a chart listing what vegetables are expected to be harvested when? I&#39;ve seen CSAs that do this, and it&#39;s very useful and handy... Here&#39;s one (http://www.prairienet.org/pcsa/croplist.htm) from a CSA I belonged to in Urbana, IL...

				We don&#39;t have a chart from our farmer -- but we do have a weekly record of last year&#39;s shares.<br /><br />This is only our second year so suggestions welcome -- a chart is a good idea.

				*bump*<br /><br />This note just went out to people on our mailing list -- I thought I&#39;d share it here as well though as it makes some great points and is a good reminder to sign up!<br /><br />Come meet Farmer Bill THIS Tuesday, May 9th, and sign up for Organic Veggies!<br /><br />We&#39;ve contacted you before, but we want to remind you that time is running short for you to join Hellgate CSA for the whole season.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you delay much longer, you might miss out on Green Thumb Farm&#39;s great spring greens and luscious, sweet strawberries.&nbsp; &nbsp;Every week you put off joining is one less week of Bill&#39;s freshly harvested organic vegetables on your table.<br /><br />We at Hellgate CSA also want to share a little bit of why we think being a CSA member is such a great idea.&nbsp; &nbsp;One, it&#39;s easy on your wallet.&nbsp; &nbsp;Hellgate CSA&#39;s basic share is only $10 a week.&nbsp; The share is an ideal size for two people (or one really enthusiastic vegetable lover).&nbsp; If you&#39;d like, you can share a share with someone (a neighbor or friend).&nbsp; We&#39;re also offering a fresh flower share, honey shares, and September tomato shares (in addition to the tomatoes included in the regular share).<br /><br />But there are bigger, better reasons to join Hellgate CSA.&nbsp; As a CSA member, you are taking steps to declaring independence from the corporate agribusinesses that ship you pesticide-laced tasteless tomatoes and squishy squash grown thousands of miles from your door.&nbsp; &nbsp;Instead, you will be supporting a local, sustainable food economy, and getting great-tasting vegetables while you&#39;re at it.&nbsp; Your support of Green Thumb Farm, a mostly organic farm in Water Mill, Long Island, also means you will be helping to prevent soil erosion, protect water quality, save energy, and promote biodiversity.&nbsp; &nbsp;You will have a direct connection with Bill Halsey, our farmer.&nbsp; He&#39;s a great guy, but don&#39;t take our word for it – meet him yourself at the Freeze Peach Café THIS Tuesday, May 9th, from 5:30-7:30.<br /><br />Payment plans are available.&nbsp; You can sign up online and learn more about Hellgate CSA on our website at www.hellgatecsa.com. <br /><br />Join today!&nbsp; We can&#39;t wait to see you.<br /><br />The Hellgate CSA
