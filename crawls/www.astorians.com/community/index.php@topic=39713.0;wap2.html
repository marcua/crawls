			Take Root presents MoveWorks and Ballaro Dance<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;MoveWorks: The programs will include four works by the company - a continuation of the Helga Series - an ongoing exploration into a the psyche of a simple, yet comedic, country-woman, choreographed by Sarah Foster, performed by Christina Morris, Alanna Newkirk, Monica Mordaunt, Charlotte Ghigliazza, and Phoebe Sandford, set to an array of classical favorites; The Red Scarf - a slapstick comedy duo choreographed and performed by co-directors Sarah Foster and Christina Serrano-Goden set to the music of Charlie Chaplin; a new contemporary ballet duet choreographed by co-director Christian Serrano-Goden; and a new work by guest choreographer Sandra Shih Parks.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Ballaro Dance: Ballaro Dance will present three works: Stairway To Nowhere is a quirky solo where the dancer shifts through various characters, first becoming an amoeba â€“ like serpent, then at times like a circus performer exploring daring physical feats. Vivaldi begins as a duet of sisters, friends, confidants. The leader and follower roles of the two performers shift to enable growth and change. The circles created in space and in the body reflect the ongoing, and the plucking of strings, or the heartbeat, keeps time. Reflections on Thursday is a new work made during weekly reflection following the 2016 Presidential Election.&nbsp; This piece references the sights, sounds, and images experienced in NYC and how we are impacted by them.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;April 21st &amp; 22nd, 2017 at 8pm<br />&nbsp;Admission: $15<br />&nbsp;Green Space Studio<br />&nbsp;37-24 24th Street, #301<br />&nbsp;Long Island City, NY 11101<br />&nbsp;718-956-3037<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Tickets are available at the door or online at http://www.greenspacestudio.org/TakeRoot.html<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Take Root is a monthly curated series that supports dance makers by providing an opportunity to show a half evening work paired with another artist.
