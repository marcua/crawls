				I was walking to the train this morning and I saw a girl dressed in a smart little outfit walking with her mother.&nbsp; It reminded me of the excitement I always felt on the first day of school.&nbsp; I loved shopping for school supplies and picking out my clothes.&nbsp; I always planned my outfit carefully because the first day of the school year always felt like a chance to be someone new.&nbsp; It never worked though, not even when I wore my &quot;cool&quot; jeans (the only ones that didn&#39;t expose my big white socks when I sat down).

				See, while you were feeling all nostalgic, I was looking at all the students today and thinking, &quot;Suckas!!!&quot;<br /><br />I don&#39;t miss school...except for the part about not having to make a living. This is the time of year where I have that dream about being late for class. It never fails. Same stupid dream, same feeling of panic.

				Thanks Jtrane!&nbsp; I have the fear of the wrong tie dream, but not so often.<br />I used to have a really interesting one where I was being chased down a hill, I was never sure by what, but it always got my adrenaline flowing.&nbsp; I haven&#39;t had that one in years though.

				This time of year always makes me think of that line from You&#39;ve Got Mail where he tells her that he&#39;d like to send her a bouquet of freshly sharpened pencils. Don&#39;t you miss that smell? I love the fall. <br /><br />Like most, I hated school (high school in particular), but the things I hated about it (trying to be cool, get in with the popular kids, stressing myself out over doing well, etc.) have followed me into the real world. The only thing I LOVE not having anymore is homework. Only I&#39;ve found that if I&#39;m doing my job really well, I usually still have homework to do. How depressing.&nbsp; :-(

				I love the first day of school.&nbsp; I love my girls!!

I still have the one where I realize that I forgot to go to class ALL semester and then I find out I have to go take the final in order to graduate. <br /><br />As far as hating school - I hated undergraduate school.&nbsp; I couldn&#39;t have picked a more inappropriate place to go - Rensselaer Polytechnic.&nbsp; I never wanted to step foot in a classroom again.&nbsp; Then I went to graduate school at Antioch.&nbsp; There were never two more polar opposite institutes of higher learning.&nbsp; It brought me back to loving education.

				I didn&#39;t like school until the second half of high school when I actually got to take some interesting classes, but I do miss that &quot;fresh start&quot; feeling.&nbsp; I still get it, even minus the school.&nbsp; I love fall.<br /><br />And like everyone else I have the recurring forgot-you-registered-for-the-class-have-to-take-the-final dream.&nbsp; It&#39;s so, so awful.&nbsp; Clearly those kinds of experiences are pretty primal and ingrained.

University of Chicago is nothing like Hampshire though, so I think I&#39;m in the clear. <br /><br />Incidentally, I dated a guy from RPI for a long time, so I spent half my weekends in Troy.

				UC Santa Cruz had in the meantime all but done away with narrative evaluations, but I loved them as an undergraduate.<br />The only time I was even allowed to ask for a grade was when I was in upper division courses for my major (and I&#39;m glad I did opt for some grades because I was an econ major)<br /><br />narrative evals didn&#39;t do away with numerical grading, it challenged it and allowed for my profs and instructors to make the effort to really say how well I did in class beyond my exams (i.e. if I participated, if I was articulate, etc etc)...<br />they also made for great references when I first started out

It really did seem like a good idea, but it wound up being one of the most anti-intellectual environments I&#39;ve ever experienced.

				My experience is very different. I was very fortunate to go to an International School throughout my secondary school education. I really enjoyed middle and high school very much. Most of my very dear friends are from those days. Jocks and nerds comingled in relative peace and harmony. Actually, most of the jocks were quite nerdy in their own way.<br /><br />Like the previous poster&#39;s experience with Berkley, I can say that Manhattan School of Music was a strange trip also.<br /><br />I feel that my H.S.&#39;s alumni programme is more first-rate than my conservatory! <br /><br />I did play a lot of AD&amp;D (Advanced Dungeons and Dragons) and some people found that a bit strange.
