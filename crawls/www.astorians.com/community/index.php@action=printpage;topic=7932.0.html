				Folks, if you can&#039;t have an intelligent conversation and express your views without name calling please do not post. This is an interesting discussion, but it&#039;s made trivial by name calling and insults. I&#039;m interested in intelligent dialog about the issue - and it&#039;s one that is not frequently discussed publicly. Let&#039;s let each other have opinions about this emotional issue without the need for making it personal or abusing each other.

				What a terrible thing. <br /><br />Years ago a woman wrote into Dear Abby (I think), saying that her father, a truck driver, had been deeply scarred after someone committed suicide by stepping in front of his truck. He was tormented with feeling of guilt, wondering if he could have somehow done something differently and spared the man&#039;s life. <br /><br />I would hope that anyone considering suicide and reading this would remember the pain they will cause their families and loved ones in addition to any innocent bystanders, and seek help instead.&nbsp; <br /><br />National Strategy for Suicide Prevention website: http://mentalhealth.samhsa.gov/suicideprevention/<br /><br />

				I have often thought the same thing, and yes I&#039;ve also lost someone close to me to suicide. It really bothers me when people decide to involve others in their attempts to kill themselves.. like kids who shoot up schools and then shoot themselves, and those who decide to drive in front of an oncoming train or drive the wrong way on the highway or something. Those people are obviously messed up and not in a proper state of mind for considering how it might affect others, but it still bothers me.

				I don&#039;t understand why people are so upset at Frappe&#039;s post. This is a &quot;rant &amp; vent&quot; forum; he appears to be venting. He also said he was on the train that hit that person. I think it is completely reasonable for him to be upset.<br /><br />I also don&#039;t understand some of the criticisms. Everyone knows that the person who committed suicide was suffering and was in a terrible state, but this doesn&#039;t mean that all anger directed towards that person is somehow cruel or inhuman. I think it is also unfair to suggest that we ought to &quot;think of what this poor person must have been going through in order to do something like take there own life,&quot; without also acknowledging what those people on that train went through. We can and should make room for those people to express their feelings, and many of those people, like it or not, will feel anger. Just imagine how terrible it would have been if you were a parent sitting with your children in the front of the train. I think most people in that situation would feel a deep sense of anger and frustration afterwards. That&#039;s completely natural. Why belittle or criticize those feelings? <br /><br />Also, I think it&#039;s wrong to take Frappe&#039;s suggestion to imply that it&#039;s possible to commit suicide without affecting others. I think his point has to do with the degree to which it affects others. All suicides affect others. If you jump off of a building and land on a group of tourists though, it affects others in a much more egregious sense. I think this was what he had in mind concerning this particular suicide.<br /><br />I think everyone should keep in mind that Frappe was on a train that killed someone two days ago. If he is upset about it and expresses his anger in the appropriate &quot;rant &amp; vent&quot; forum, why not just see his post as a way for him to say what&#039;s on his mind and to get it off his chest? <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				It&#039;s sad to think how miserable a person has to be, and how totally hopeless and sad they must feel to be able to stand in front of a train and let it hit them. I can&#039;t imagine the pain they must feel to be able to do that, no matter how they do it. I feel for them and anyone who cares for them.

				I agree that the delivery of the message was more in the voice of someone who is warning that there would be a fire drill at 3pm today and please remember to file out of the building in an orderly fashion.&nbsp; But as I&#039;ve found, some people are not always effective communicators for an issue at hand.&nbsp; <br /><br />Not everyone is good at explaining things or being clear - for instance, I can think of performing musicians that play wonderfully but can&#039;t teach their instrument to save their life.&nbsp; It&#039;s not a knock on their ability to form complex ideas, either.&nbsp; For me, understanding this makes me less likely to throw the baby out with the bathwater and completely write someone off.&nbsp; I&#039;ve known lovely people that sounds harsh and abrasive through their writing, but face to face I&#039;ve had some amazing interactions with them.<br /><br />There are some users here that come to mind that have communication styles that I don&#039;t particularly care for (I won&#039;t name names). But mind you, it&#039;s simply my preference. And really, there are some here that I know do not like the way I write things.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m sorry you were on the train, Frappe.&nbsp; <br /><br />And logicchop points out that this place is a &quot;a &#039;rant &amp; vent&#039; forum&quot;.&nbsp; Indeed.&nbsp; That means anyone is allowed to rant and vent, even against another person&#039;s ranting and venting!&nbsp;

				I have had several people in my life commit suicide.&nbsp; A cousin hanged himself after going through an ugly divorce and losing what he believed was everything in his life; a friend who had epilepsy and struggled with his seizures, the side affects of the medications that he took to control the seizures and a family who treated him like a reject because of his condition; a successful high school athlete and future minister who was gay, but was unable to tell his family because he grew up in the same backwards little town that I ran from as soon as I turned 18; and a struggling musician who battled with alcohol and drug addiction, until he finally decided to take a lethal overdose.&nbsp; <br /><br />In each situation, I had the mix of emotions regarding their loss.&nbsp; There was anger, bitterness, and deep sadness.&nbsp; I knew most of their families and mourned with them.&nbsp; I found that being angry or bitter didn&#039;t really help and I struggled to empathize with what they were going through so I could identify other friends and acquaintances who were going through the same thing.&nbsp; Through this experience I gained invaluable knowledge and compassion for people who are suffering to that extent and feel hopeless.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve never actually witnessed someone kill themselves and I&#039;m pretty certain that it&#039;s a traumatic experience; however, based on my own personal losses, I tend not to judge the individual who has committed suicide without knowing more.&nbsp; But then again, each person has their experience and their own opinion regarding this topic and I can&#039;t judge how they feel either.<br /><br />

				Dang, I needed a dictionary to even figure out what a git was!&nbsp; Thanks for the example Urrisgirl.<br /><br />On communication styles, some of us do not feel the need to preface the post with perfunctory remarks about how bad we feel about it.&nbsp; It&#039;s stating the obvious and doesn&#039;t need to be said.&nbsp; Though some might see such terseness as disrespectful or ineffective, others are inclined to think that manufactured, impassioned remarks are no more effective or respectful.&nbsp; <br /><br />Either way, I do not think suicide is a cowardly act.&nbsp; I think each situation is different, but if someone arrives at such a decision in a well thought out manner, and it is not being used as a permanent solution for a temporary problem, then it might be a good decision.&nbsp; Its one&#039;s own personal business and it should be kept that way.&nbsp;

				Frappe, thanks for your clarification.&nbsp; At the risk of totally overstaying my welcome in this thread, I just wanted to explain that the reason I thought your comments were flip was not because you did not express sympathy for the deceased, but because there was really no foregrounding of what happened to make you react in the way that you did, in such a way to encourage dialogue.<br /><br />I assume (but am not sure) that what you would have said is that the experience of being witness to a suicide was a troubling one for the passengers on the train, including yourself.&nbsp; And to question whether suicide should be a public act, and whether innocent bystanders ought to be pulled into someone else&#039;s emotional state.&nbsp; But again, I don&#039;t know and I don&#039;t really know what good it does to demand that people not commit suicide publicly (which is how your original post sounded)...

But, when one does so in a public manner -- i.e. jumping in front of a train OR as I read in the paper yesterday a man jumped in front of 3 different cars trying to kill himself in NJ before finally getting hit (but he didn;t die) -- it disrupts the lives of others (people on the train), puts others lives in jeopardy when they don;t feel like geting killed or hurt (e.g. people jumping out of windows), and scars people for life (guy whose car hit the guy trying to kill himself). <br /><br />&nbsp;So I am sorry but I think we can ask that people do not make their suicides public.&nbsp; Suicide is inherently a selfish act (I am not inlcuding NYCmac Users hypos in this category as I think the reason are different and don;t particuarly fit into &quot;suicide&quot;) and to involve other people in that act is selfish, unnecessary and downright rude.

I have also believed that those who attempt suicide in public are doing so as a last minute thought; that it is a spontaneous act. In general I believe that suicide is a very private/personal matter. That the mere act of making it public is a cry for help. I simply cannot deal with terms like rude or selfish . . . unnecessary, yes . . . but not selfish or rude. In that sudden moment of desperation, the end of mental anguish is all that is thought of.

				Clinically speaking, suicide is rarely spontaneous. People who commit suicide have in fact planned it and are usually coming <em>out </em> of a depression. When an individual is so depressed and distraught, they can rarely move, get out of bed, or leave the house. It is when a little bit of energy is mustered, that suicide actually occurs, and usually with a specific plan.<br /><br />There are certain suicides that are in fact a cry for help: notes that are left to be found, attempts at overdosing on nonlethal substances, cutting yourself in a way to get a lot of blood and effect, but not as lethal, etc. <br /><br />However, jumping in front of a train is not a cry for help...there is no one to hear it. It is a violent act of self-injury. I&#039;m not judging either way, and it is upsetting that an individual may feel that a situation has come to a point that it is no longer salvageable. It is unfortunate that others had their lives inconvenienced for a couple of hours, but on the bright side, a couple of hours of a delayed train in a life that you don&#039;t feel suicide is the answer...not so bad. <br /><br />While not a cry for help, certain more violent suicides <em>may</em> be attention seeking, and wishing to cause pain to others...the more violent and disturbing, the more guilt the mourners may feel. Sort of a &quot;they&#039;ll be sorry when I&#039;m dead&quot; scenario. Other more violent suicides may be by people that are so ambivalent, they are not confident they will be able to carry out the suicide, and to it in a way that leaves little room for error (jumping off the 20 story building, gun in the mouth, etc.)My two cents on the topic.
