				So I noticed that L&#039;artiste has been open for a little while in the space that was formerly Piazza Pizza next to Cavo, and I did a search and couldn&#039;t find any info on it. Just wondering if anyone has been, how it is, or anything else.&nbsp; From what I&#039;ve gathered, it&#039;s owned and operated by the folks that do Cavo and Studio Square, but it seems like every time I walk by it&#039;s practically empty. I think last night may have been the first time I&#039;ve seen anyone inside. <br />Anyway, just curious, with the shuttering of Bistro Les Minots, we&#039;re hoping that there&#039;s another decent French restaurant just around the corner.

				I ate there with friends about a month ago and enjoyed my meal very much.&nbsp; We were given a salmon tartare amuse to start.&nbsp; I had the scallop dish mentioned on the blog linked to above as a starter, and seared duck breast as my main.&nbsp; I found everything nicely cooked and the flavours well-balanced.&nbsp; If they were closer to me I would already have been back, but since they are a little far I haven&#039;t yet had the chance.&nbsp; But it&#039;s definitely worth trying.

				I was there last night with some friends, and we all enjoyed it very much.&nbsp; Nice staff and friendly service, and the space is cozy.&nbsp; We were given an amuse of chicken liver and bacon, topped with some pea shoots (I think they were pea shoots) on top of a housemade chip - delicious!&nbsp; It was adjusted for our vegetarian friend with hummus with olive, which she liked a lot.&nbsp; There was a little bread and tapenade at the table, too.<br /><br />We tried both the beet and goat cheese salad and the baby spinach salad with fennel, citrus, almonds, and a light creamy blue cheese dressing, perfectly dressed. Out came a little espresso cup filled with a kind of ricotta and almond soup with a touch of truffle oil, which was wonderful. Then we had a seared scallop over creamed spinach and mornay sauce, topped with a cute little fried egg with another drop of truffle oil on it.&nbsp; Wow!!<br /><br />For our mains, I had the duck breast, which was served with spaghetti squash, which was just lovely.&nbsp; My friend had the poulet roti, which was very tasty and moist.&nbsp; Our veggie friend had the open mushroom ravioli in a cream sauce that was also delicious. Everyone liked what they got.<br /><br />For dessert we had profiteroles, a fig tart, and a coffee panna cotta with caramel ice cream.&nbsp; All were excellent but the panna cotta really stood out for me - it had some chocolate toffee crunchies between the panna cotta and whipped cream and ice cream, and I absolutely loved it.<br /><br />The wines were very enjoyable, too.<br /><br />I left the restaurant satisfied but not overstuffed.&nbsp; That&#039;s a win in my book.&nbsp; Food and wine were just great.&nbsp; So nice to have a good French option in town. I&#039;ll definitely be back!<br /><br />

				oh, awesome! I&#039;m so excited to hear about this place.<br /><br />I just made reservations to take my bf for his birthday next weekend :)<br /><br />When I made the reservation, they mentioned that it&#039;s BYOB for wineâ€”which I&#039;m all for, but confused about the comments here about their wine selection.

				We&#039;ve been there three times.&nbsp; So far everything has ranged from good to excellent.&nbsp; It&#039;s a little pricey for the area, but the food quality is definitely there.&nbsp; They appear to have a pretty serious chef; we&#039;ve gotten an amuse all three times and all of the food has been pretty sophisticated.<br /><br />I&#039;ve read reviews suggesting that the steak isn&#039;t that great.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t had it, so YMMV.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />As of a week ago they were cash only, so bring cash.&nbsp; They also let us bring a bottle of wine, which saves a bunch of money; I&#039;m not sure how long they&#039;ll allow that without a charge, of course.<br /><br />If you live in the area you should definitely give it a shot.&nbsp; We need more good restaurants around here!

				Went here on Saturday night and the food was absolutely amazing.&nbsp; The portions are on the smaller side but everything tasted so wonderful, it was a thoroughly satisfying meal.&nbsp; &nbsp;:mrgreen:&nbsp; We had the grilled scallops, the duck, the open faced ravioli, the panna cotta and the fig tart.&nbsp; Everything had such a nice mix of flavors.&nbsp; I hope they are popular enough to stay in business.&nbsp; Astoria needs more places like this in the neighborhood.

				There is a Groupon deal being run right now for L&#039;Artiste: $15 for $30 worth of food. It&#039;s a three day deal, so you still have another two days to purchase. You can get there by linking on the right sidebar on the groupon site <em>or</em> by clicking my personal referral link: http://www.groupon.com/r/uu690296 (http://www.groupon.com/r/uu690296)! :mrgreen:

				I ate there last night.&nbsp; Food was so good.&nbsp; Staff could not be be more pleasent and accommodating.&nbsp; I had French onion soup and coq au van.&nbsp; Delicious.&nbsp; Friend had a seafood appetizer rolled in phylo dough with Moroccan spices and the steak.&nbsp; They do have a liquor license now.&nbsp; We had a very nice Bordeaux.&nbsp; Dessert was a show stopper.&nbsp; I had a pear tart and friend had a chocolate cake.&nbsp; We got there just before six and were the only ones there.&nbsp; One other group of people came in just before we left at 7:30.&nbsp; I do hope businesses gets better for them.&nbsp; Seem like nice people and a great addition to the neighborhood.

				After all the positive reviews, both here and yelp...I had high expectations for this place....I&#039;m sorry but it was a real let down. Our waitress was non-attentive and the food was average at best. It just doesn&#039;t really fit the bill of a real French bistro... I really miss Bistro Les Minots!! ... now that was real French Bistro fare ! ..Hopefully it will be back one day.&nbsp;

				We finally made it here, a few weeks ago, and it was dynamite. Unfortuantely, I don&#039;t recall what we had ordered, other than everything was great, and that we skipped on dessert, and went to DiWine for one last glass of wine and the goat cheese and fig zeppole. Great spot for a date, I couldn&#039;t ask for anything more of the place.

				I had a very nice dinner on Friday night at L&#039;Artiste, a small French bistro on the corner of 31st Avenue, 43rd Street, and Newtown Road (next to Cavo).&nbsp; I started with a salmon tartare on top of avocado and a roasted beet disk--both the salmon and avocado were creamy, and it was a substantial portion.&nbsp; My entree was sliced duck breast on top of squash puree and vegetables in cream sauce.&nbsp; The duck was cooked medium rare as ordered, and was generally tender except for a few tough bits of skin.&nbsp; For dessert, I had the pear tart in a caramel sauce.&nbsp; Though the pastry part could have been crisper, I liked the flavors and it was easily large enough for share.&nbsp; The red sangria is interesting--it has cinnamon but no pieces of fruit.&nbsp; <br /><br />The owner, who is originally from Morocco, and his staff are very friendly.&nbsp; Prices are average--appetizers in the low teens, entrees in the high teens to low twenties.&nbsp; It&#039;s nice to have another French restaurant in the neighborhood.

				It&#039;s been a while since we went, but I love the place, and it&#039;s been discussed a few times. For some reason I had to search for &quot;Artiste&quot; without the l&#039; to find this:<br />http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=19731.msg206408#msg206408<br /><br />But I definitely want to head back, as I absolutely loved the meal I had there.

				I FINALLY went last night.&nbsp; I had purchased a Groupon for $30 late last year and for whatever reason just haven&#039;t been able to get there.<br /><br /><br />Anyway, I insisted we go last night.&nbsp; We walked in and were greeted in a very friendly manner and escorted to a table.&nbsp; They were about 1/2 full.&nbsp; We ordered escargot, I ordered the lamb, he ordered the NY Strip.&nbsp; We also had a very nice bottle of Cote du Rhone and the chocolat fondant for dessert.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />This place is sublime.&nbsp; Or maybe I should say WAS sublime.&nbsp; Everything was absolutely perfect until the very end when they brought the check over.&nbsp; They automatically put an 18% gratuity on the bill.&nbsp; When I asked them what it was they said they do it for all Groupons.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />What a way to ruin an evening!&nbsp; I own 2 businesses that have done the Groupon thing.&nbsp; I understand how it works:&nbsp; it&#039;s great for the consumer and it positively SUCKS for the business owner.&nbsp; You&#039;re eviscerated on what you sold because of Groupon&#039;s cut.&nbsp; In the beginning, and because of the economy, it seemed like such a good idea:&nbsp; get more people in the door!&nbsp; Introduce your product/service to new people!&nbsp; Grow your tribe!&nbsp; The reality is that a new culture developed:&nbsp; the grouponer.&nbsp; It&#039;s a group of people who ONLY go to places that have deals.&nbsp; You&#039;ll never capture them and so the promotion is a waste of money.&nbsp; Let me add this:&nbsp; there are some people (like me) who buy these things who are not about going to the cheapest place possible all the time.&nbsp; I&#039;m a total candidate for becoming a &quot;raving fan&quot; of a place (read my numerous sycofantic SugarFreak posts).&nbsp; All L&#039;Artiste did was piss me off with their auto-gratuity scam.&nbsp; Let me also say that gratuities are OPTIONAL.&nbsp; I&#039;m not even sure it&#039;s legal for them to add it on - at least without telling you ahead of time.&nbsp; I understand they did it because maybe they noticed that Grouponers - who aren&#039;t interested in a relationship - don&#039;t care if they tip appropriately, and by that I mean tipping on the full value.&nbsp; That&#039;s just the way it goes, though.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />The kicker - I would have left way more than 18%!&nbsp; Not only did they piss me off to a level that I&#039;m going to bitch about them to everyone but they ultimately shortchanged themselves.<br /><br /><br />What a shame!

				Many of the Groupon/Blackboard Eats/Living Social deals note right on the coupon that an 18% gratuity may be added to the bill.&nbsp; Some places do end up adding the automatic grat and some don&#039;t.&nbsp; Your beef is probably with the coupon companies and not with the restaurant, and next time check the fine print.&nbsp;

				The 18% gratuity is there to protect the servers not the establishment. I had been a server for many years in the past, and there are way more times that I was tipped on the discounted total (I guess) than on the actual total. Just saying ... It has nothing to do with the restaurant trying to scam you, they don&#039;t get a cut of the tips. (That is, unless the owner waits tables ;))

				The groupon story doesn&#039;t surprise me.&nbsp; L&#039;artiste is at a --- surprising --- price point for Astoria.&nbsp; Usually I don&#039;t complain about overall prices when the food is good, but twice I&#039;ve walked out of there with a $100+ bill for an app, 2 entrees, a dessert, and a bottle of wine.&nbsp; $120+ with tip, which is starting to venture into L&#039;incontro and Christos territory.&nbsp; And, well, L&#039;artiste is tasty and can be surprising but L&#039;incontro it&#039;s not.&nbsp; I thought the same thing about Sugar Freak when they opened with $11 and $12 drink prices...which are now at a much more pleasant $8.50.
