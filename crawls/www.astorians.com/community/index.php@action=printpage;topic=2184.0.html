				<br />Here&#39;s the Information about A3:<br /><br /><br />Astoria Animation Association&#39;s purpose is to broaden the senses of anime for those who are new and also those who would like to see new and classic titles. The meetings will show both classic and new anime depending on the scheduled airings and ideas from members of the association and anime fans around the community. Founded by Aristotle Stathatos, former member of many anime clubs in New York and in college, A3 will promote new anime as well as provide information about aquiring them for collective or viewing purposes. <br /><br />The anime that will be screening during every meeting will consist of fansubbings from other organizations that are shared by many of their administrators, enabling a clearer and brighter visual context for both the viewers and fans alike. It is also noted that several of the anime that will be screened will be both licensed and non-licensed, meaning both anime on the market for sales and anime that are either aired in Japanese television stations or haven&#39;t been negotiated by the animation corporations (United States Manga Corps, Viz, Bandai, etc.) in the United States, will be viewed in every meeting. <br /><br />One of the prime examples of our viewing will be our first meetings in Waltz-Astoria (www.waltz-astoria.com), May 25, 8p.m<br /><br />Martian Successor Nadesico (1996-ADV Films)<br />http://www.animenfo.com/animetitle,1,iixlmv,martian_success.html<br /><br />Avenger (2005)<br />www.boxtorrents.com<br /><br />Revolutionary Girl Utena (1997- Central Park Media/Software Sculptors)<br />http://www.animenfo.com/animetitle,308,pqjjon,revolutionary_g.html<br /><br /><br />All are welcomed to watch and meet up with anime fans in A3&#39;s debut in Waltz Astoria. We hope to see you all there. The more people that arrive the better. I would love to start these meetings as soon as possible so we can have a starting fanbase in Astoria.<br /><br />www.waltz-astoria.com<br /><br />-Aristotle-<br /><br />
