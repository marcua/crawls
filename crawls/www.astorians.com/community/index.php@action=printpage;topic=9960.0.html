				Democracy for NYC is a progressive democratic organization dedicated to raising political awareness in individual communities and advocating for change through local involvement.&nbsp; Our next meeting is on <strong>April 2nd </strong> from 7:30-9:15 at the Sanford Restaurant.&nbsp; Bring your appetite for good food and political discussion as we look forward to the Pennsylvania primary, discuss the state of NY politics and the State Senate, and discuss our plans to work park clean-ups/canned food drive. All are welcome! <br />&nbsp;<br />

				Work is kicking my butt, as usual, so I probably won&#039;t be able to make it.&nbsp; I feel bad because I want to get involved and it&#039;s such a small commitment (and I love Sanford&#039;s food and support Costas) to make, similar to the Heff&#039;s Transportation Alternatives events and meeting.&nbsp; However, this job pays for my rent and allows me to wear nice, fancy clothes and go to lounges where the drinks cost way too MUCH!!!<br /><br />That being said, have a great time, guys, and keep me updated on what&#039;s going on!&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				Had a great time as usual.&nbsp; The Linkup has a lot of the things I wish my Democratic Club had; open discussion, political action, good food.&nbsp; (my democratic club does have Sanka though).
