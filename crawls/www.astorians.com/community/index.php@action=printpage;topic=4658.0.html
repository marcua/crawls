				does anyone know of an after-school program for elementary school kids in southern astoria/lic -- ideally &#39;til about 6p.m.&nbsp; our local school doesn&#39;t have one available.&nbsp; i&#39;m hoping some parents in the neighborhood would already know the answer to this.&nbsp; <br />

				I do know that the local elementary school has 1,300 plus kids.&nbsp; I can&#39;t imagine that there isn&#39;t a demand for afterschool programs for parents who both work.&nbsp; I guess I&#39;ll contact the school and see what they say.&nbsp; I&#39;ll post here if anyone is interested.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				Could there maybe be something at LaGuardia Community College (that&#39;s what it&#39;s called, right?)<br />Just a thought.

				my elementary school also had one when i was a kid, but i understand programs in some of the elementary schools were phased out over the years.&nbsp; i&#039;ll look into laguardia and will check to see whether p.s. 70 takes kids from other schools.&nbsp; b/t/w what&#039;s the location of p.s. 70?&nbsp; thanks so much for your reply. <br />
