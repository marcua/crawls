The idea behind McGriddles was to create a breakfast sandwich version of pancakes with syrup on them. And then you can put sausage or egg and bacon or whatever inside. So the &quot;bread&quot; of the breakfast sandwich consists of two dense pancake-type things with a very distinct maple syrup flavoring added in. <br /><br />If you get the sausage one (as I LOVE to do), you&#39;re eating a bite of pancake and sausage with syrup on it when you bite into it. Truly genius. This is why Americans are FAT. Only Americans would think up something like this. God bless us.&nbsp; :wink:

				Thanks, Manda!&nbsp; Yup, I love the syrup on bacon/sausage thing, too (well, I don&#39;t like sausage very much, but it&#39;s definitely better with syrup).&nbsp; This would be why I think praline bacon from Elizabeth&#39;s in New Orleans is the food equivalent of crack.&nbsp; :lol: It&#39;s a good thing Elizabeth&#39;s is in New Orleans (yes, reopened), not New York, and it&#39;s also a good thing they serve it only at breakfast, or else it would be a very unhealthy lunch item!
