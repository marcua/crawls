				instead of hijacking someone else&#039; s blog on strand i have decided to start a new blog just to highlight the issues confronting the community because of the new Strand Smokehouse on broadway as well as its sister business Bakeway.<br /><br />I wasnt going to do this at this very momement but figured that strand/bakeway show no carefor the community so why should i care. Myhope is that our posts will educatethe community and patrons on exactly how its owners and employees are destroying our community and hopeful cause some positive changes.<br /><br />

				You should definitely be talking with the Community Board - they might be able to get the attention of the owner, especially as they will have to go back before the CB for liquor license renewal eventually.

				Issue # 1 -&nbsp; Strand and Bakeway is essentially the same operation.<br /><br />Strand and Bakeway hae common ownership and employees, as well as the same kitchen. Since strand doesnt have a kitchen....food, booz, and supplies are shuttled from bakeway,&nbsp; two store fronts ove via the backyard. This is done at all times of the day and night, particularly troubling is the 2am cleaning up and prep for the next day.<br /><br />Employees show no concern for the community around them. They are loud, slam stuff, throw beer kegs around like they are action figures, and hang out on their breaks in front of peoples windows.<br /><br />Just the other day at 2am they were either high pressure cleaning some equipment or cutting up some cow. It woke up the whole neighborhood.<br /><br />Srand stores there beer kegs and other supplies in the bakeway side of the backyard. This is messy and loud when employees strart toying around with supplies.

				Also - when we had to fight NuBar/Ultra on Broadway, we formed a e-group on yahoo - and put up signs around the neighborhood encouraging people to join, then were able to coordinate our 311 calls.&nbsp; It helped us, though it took a while to get them reigned in.

Well if they do strand is not showing care in this regard. Patrons and employees smoke all over the backyard as well as the front patio, even though the front is&nbsp; technically a covered space. I suppose this is issue #2 - Strand is polluting our air and may be in violation of&nbsp; nyc smoking laws.

				It&#039;s a good question.&nbsp; I&#039;d suggest calling the health department.&nbsp; They might not be able to smoke in the backyard as it&#039;s considered part of the restaurant.

				Bakeway is no problem, it is actually nice, and run well. Their new place is potential problem due to noise.&nbsp; AS I mentioned in other thread, I heard sound system being tested, it is loud enough to be used at Madison Square Garden. They have a stage for bands, so I can imagine how it will get.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />Across from them is Monte, a place that was supposed to be food related, turned out to be club that blasts music till 4 am every weekend.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;People on 33rd avenue get more noise than Broadway from Monte , way more.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />People from both sides of street should team up.&nbsp; The 33rd avenue people and some from building next to monte have tried to get help, been calling 311 for 2 years, nothing.&nbsp; Gianaris office, nothing.&nbsp; Vallone, nothing.&nbsp;

The kitchen for strand is located in bakeway, they are storing beer kegs in the back of bakeway, just the other day they were cutting up a pig at 2am to smoke in the back of bakeway&nbsp; for the strand (well maybe not exactly but you get the picture of the noise). Employees are going in between via backyard at all hours of the day and night, including as i write this. How is this not a problem?<br /><br />Also, i dont know about your issues with the other place on the other side of broadway, but i think half the problem is the other side is mainly made up of smaller apt buildings and family homes. Just behind strand and bakeway is 2 massive apt buildings each with at least 100 apts each. So when we are done with strand,&nbsp; maybe we can do something about your problem with monte.<br /><br />As for the noise from the stage, if they manage to keep it inside there will not be a problem. If they dont then managers can can expect the community will fight back. No MSG&nbsp; in astoria.<br />

				I haven&#039;t been in the Strand yet but plan to as I heard the food was good. From all the complaints I&#039;m reading, It would be best to have a proper video recording backing up the claims. Some of these claims seem highly exaggerated. From my understanding, this is zoned as a commercial area.<br />Once again, a video recording of your problems and uploading to YouTube or something would help all of us agree and take actions against the extreme livability conditions you state.

				Issue # 3 - Strand regularly violates NYC noise ordinance.<br /><br />With its staff and patrons going in out of the backyard and into bakeway, loud noise from the place is heard throughout the area. This occurs thoughout the day and night. Its not just one person or one building that feels like this. Today i spoke to someone inthe other building overlooking this establishment and tenants are very pissed.<br /><br />Its interesting because the owner of strand/bakeway personally suggested that he was going to be good for the neighbors because he would get the loud and dirty chinese restaurant workers out of the backyard along with thier rodents. Excuse me but your place makes substanially more noise and garbage than the nearby chinese restaurant. The only question now is what about the rodents? Maybe they are making all the noise?

It amuses me a bit to check out some patrons come out in the backyard and look around the proximity of the buildings each with over 100 plus units and without regard to the people in them simply t start making noise, drinking, and smoking.&nbsp; &nbsp;no regard for the community!<br /><br /><br />

				Well I heard the food was really good, the service is on point and the cost is fair, please refer to yelp for further in dep reviews - I seen no bad ones so far. And this is America, here we have freedom to smoke, drink where n when we want to, esp a OUTSiDE patio, get over it. Leave the employees alone, they are working trying to feed their families, a restaurant is high pace, lots of energy going, sorry it&#039;s not like your library. Worry about yourself not about people u don&#039;t even know who want to get some fresh air, cold hot rain snow whatever and enjoy a drink or smoke, as for the noise, it&#039;s a city urban area get use to it!

The health dept and liquor authority will be heard,on this in due time unless the establishment has paid them off to look the&nbsp; other way which is highly possible. However, with the proper pressure applied from the community and elected officials this will stop.<br /><br />As for the noise this to is controlled by nyc. Employees are also have proper protections.<br /><br />Thank God we live in a society with laws and rules! I am all for freedom....but if you want to smoke or drink don&#039;t do it directly under mine or other peoples bedroom Windows! Surely you would agree with this....if not kindly give me your addresses and I will kindly get a group together and smoke and drink under your window!

Even if you assume somebody from this board did a biased review of strand, that leaves quiet a bit of other not so great reviews. Where there is smoke their is fire. But, really i am not a food or restaurant critic. I am just a citizen with community issues that happens to be with a restaurant, or should i say a bar/ unlawful smoking yard.<br />

				Cj,it doesnt matter if we own or rent or rent controlled/sub - which 1000% they are not. But i can tell you that we are not &quot;SPOILED&quot; as you say. <br /><br />Yes, Strand took over the space from blockbuster. Thats great.....what happens inside that space as long as its compliant with all regs, doesnt matter to us. What the issues that are impacting the coumminity is that they decided to convert the backyard for use as a smoking,&nbsp; drinking, hangouting out place, as well as an expressway for workers to bring food,&nbsp; beer, and supplies from bakeway which is separated in the front by two other stores.<br /><br />So the outside&nbsp; smoke garden is know 4 stores deep. Within a few feet of this garden are apt where people are resting and sleeping. Mind you, that living in astoria we expect noise and in the past we got our share of noise from the backyard of the chinese restaurant that is in the middle of strand and bakeway. Although very annoying it was not to the level of that strand/bakeway are doing these days. Fyi...the backyard of the chinese restauant now belongs to strand as it kicked out the chinese to build their backyard out.<br /><br />Also, even if you say we need to subject ourselves to this change as we&nbsp; chose to live in a commercial zone, their are rules that must be followed which they are not&nbsp; for example patrons cannot randomly smoke anywhere in the backyard they please - it must be in a restricted&nbsp; designated space no larger than 25% of the place. The owners know this and yet they allow this to continue. Clearly, they show no care for the community, the same community that funded their bakeway, which provided them the money to expand and build this concept of strand.

You would be passionate as well if a local business man with a cafe/bakery (bakeway) decided to open another biz ( strand smokehouse) that threaten the&nbsp; very community that supported his first biz. Furthermore, this new biz is such a departure from the norm of the community&nbsp; that its essentially slapping the people in the face. This will change the fabric of the area, upset the daily routine of the locals, invite unsavory types to the block that will challenge the safety of each person that lives here. Additionally, their is no need for this as the owners could easily have opened this place as in door only and blend into the community, but they went out of their way to upset the community. If you think its just me, its not - even the village voice said as much in their review of this place.<br /><br />If you think I am some cranky elderly person with a dream of returuning to the 1920&#039;s , don&#039;t, because I am not - I am all for progress and business but this is not a proper. I accept that blockbuster closed down and there may be room for a bar that disguises itself as a fake bbq restaurant but c&#039;Mon have some ethics and responsibility to the community. Yes...this may be strong toned but its the truth. <br /><br />Merry Christmas!

				<span style="font-size: 1.35em;" class="bbc_size">You&#039;re obviously not worried about ethics and the proper way for a business to conduct itself. You have become obsessed with a single issue because it affects you personally without considering the lives of others -- their jobs, their capital investments, or their enjoyment of an evening with drinks and company. The fact is that our area&nbsp; is commercially zoned and nobody forced you to live there. Blockbuster used to be there, that&#039;s great. A restaurant is there now? That&#039;s great too. It&#039;s nice to have a local business open that&#039;s employing people and bringing happiness (as evinced by yelp reviews). All you can do, astoriacrescent, is complain.

However, you should visit the strand and check out the backyard. When you are out in the yard, look to the right, look straight ahead, and look to the left. After that you can actually report back to this board on what a great idea it was for the strand to open this yard to patrons in the middle of two 100 plus apartment building and a 3 family house. Actually, you can probably waive to some of the neighbors, I will wave back too if I know when you will be there. Don&#039;t worry I don&#039;t have to be go far out of my way to wave back cause I will will be in my bedroom or living room. Maybe I can save you a visit to the backyard, just read the village voice&#039;s review of the strand. Their words &quot;its a slap in the face of the neighborhood&quot;. Check it out....<br /><br />&nbsp;http://blogs.villagevoice.com/forkintheroad/2012/12/queue_and_cue_a.php<br /><br />Odd coming from the voice, but I guess even the village voice has standard....who knew?!<br /><br />As for the employee&#039;s jobs and owners invested capital, one should be concerned given the economy, however how about the value of our community. The value of the buildings around and the three family house probably just decreased 25% overnight. Why so some people can frolic in the backyard? Please can we have some balance.....how about keep the patrons inside and on the front patio, leave the backyard alone??? The inside is more than enough for the owner to earn a nice profit, employees employed and the community happy....I know cause I actually been inside and pass the place at least 2 of 3 times daily.<br /><br />You say to move to Ohio or new jersey? Why....so you can have a place to hang out and drink and smoke in the backyard...I think you should move to nj or Ohio, for the price you pay rent here you can get a place that has a huge backyard that you can drink and smoke without concern for the neighbors or law enforcement busting up your party cause the smoking going on in the strand is actually illegal.

				People living in the 2 buildings behind place are obviously pissed off.&nbsp; &nbsp;Strand owners obviously don&#039;t care.&nbsp; &nbsp; People don&#039;t either, if they are not ones hearing noise, which seems way out of line EVEN FOR NYC.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Maybe if it was&nbsp; animals, people would care.&nbsp; &nbsp;For example, if someone said &quot;I live behind the building where Strand is located. I raise Sea Turtles, to save them from extinction.&nbsp; &nbsp;The noise is disturbing them, ruining their sleep cycle, and stopping them from breeding. &quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; This would bring protestors and support.&nbsp; Or say &quot;My dog (or cat) can&#039;t take it!&nbsp; &nbsp;Since they opened, he/she is not eating,not sleeping, and depressed. &quot;&nbsp; This would get sympathy.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />However, no one gives&nbsp; a f!ck&nbsp; about other residents (human ones) and so&nbsp; move to close place down, or get them to tone noise down,&nbsp; will get no support, or just a little.&nbsp;

				Kudos to Clare Trapasso of the Daily News for doing this article in a well balanced way and for highlighting the issues. Kudos to Peter Vallone and his office for taking time to be involved in this issue.<br /><br />The best thing the executive team of strand can do right now to avoid further public relations issues is voluntarily close the backyard to patrons year around and at the same time build a kitchen in the Strand so employees don&#039;t have to go back and forth from bakeway. It would be a happy ending that everyone would look forward to and a public relations bonanza!!! I am sure ms.trapasso would write a follow up and the 200 plus units in the buildings around the place would become instant customers!

				And for the record: I didn&#039;t think the food was good at all. It was dry and all tasted the same. No one I know has enjoyed the food enough to want to eat there again. I make better sides at home. As a 10-year Astoria resident - I&#039;ve been in Bakeway twice. I&#039;d rather eat at Hill Country BBQ in the city - same concept, much better food. So, I&#039;m not some insider trying to post something in support. I do think this place is a cool new venue to grab a beer.

				Small victory... Yesterday employees drew a no smoking sign on the front patio overlooking broadway. This is required by law as the space has an over hanging roof. <br /><br />Anybody that doubts should check the nyc/nys smoking regulations.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the strand continues to violate the smoking law in the backyard as of last night.<br /><br />

				In the spirit of taking a break from hating on the strand, I am gonna hate on the actual landlord of the property. Why would you want to rent out the backyard to strand so it can annoy the neighbors and cause conflict with nearby business that are also renting from you??<br /><br />I realize that you must be getting some $$$ but is the longterm headache worth it? You should inspect you property and see what it is doing to the community. Undoubtedly, the property values&nbsp; and rents on commecial property are going to decline as resident move out and trouble brews from the load parties. Their may be a boycott of the businesses ( bakeway and strand for starters)&nbsp; that rent from you. What you ggonna do when you have 5 vacant store fronts? <br /><br />I know you got property taxes to pay and put food on the table, but you should reconsider your decision. You are already filth rich and made a pretty penny on these properties.

I ask myself this every time I see people hanging out in the backyard, it really upsets me because the only thing I come up with is that people are hanging out in the cold because they want to smoke. This is however not legal because the strand has not set up proper setting in the backyard&nbsp; for this activity under smoking regulations. Even in the front patio that is expressly prohibited because it has a roof people are smoking. Even as they painted a phony sign that says no smoking because of presumably a recent visit by the health dept, I saw on Thursday and Friday evenings some people standing in front of the sign and smoking. Needless to say I will be sending some emails to health dept. However, I rather them smoke in the front patio than in the backyard.

I hear loud drunks, I hear kegs rolling, I hear food and plates/silverware being ferried at all times of day. It doesn&#039;t have to be this way; it&#039;s all correctable. Put in a kitchen, close the garden, stop the music at 11pm, I&#039;m fine with that.<br /><br />I just called 311 because very loud music with very heavy bass started around 2:20am. That&#039;s just not okay. This combined with the reviews of mediocre food/running out of food have all ensured that I will not patronize this place or Bakeway. I was excited about it before it opened but if they don&#039;t get their own kitchen and close the backyard, forget it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Same here -- but I got a report back from 311 that the police found no evidence of loud noise when they checked at 2:45 am or so. Maybe the funk band/DJ was at Monte? Hard to believe we&#039;d hear it all the way across Broadway, but if so -- I weep for the people on 33rd Ave.

No ordinary employee would set out to mess with neighbors or police unless he got directions from the top. I am not surprised by the owners/managers screwing with the neighborhood but I had a personal conversation with one of them and he indicated that if we started to start complaining to much he would start to employee this method and have look outs so when police arrived they would turn down the music. <br /><br />

We cannot give up hope, which honestly at times I have. Hopefully, in the near term, we can be more coordinated&nbsp; and support each other which my be in the cards. Every person is important and every violation of local laws and regulation should be reported. <br /><br />Reminder as Vallone said in the daily news...strand is a nuisance to the community and the village voice said....the strand setup is a slap in the face to the community. <br /><br />

				Just wanted to let you all know that I was on the corner of Crescent and Broadway coming home on Saturday night when you all heard that music and there was a car parked on the corner in front of the bodega there with all the doors open and about 4 people on the sidewalk dancing. They were playing music ridiculously loudly out of a car with a souped up stereo system. Like, it was shaking the windows of the bodega. That may have been the music you were hearing.

But i believe they now have wifi.<br /><br />Many a times i have been tempted to go to bakeway but i had to stop myself. I am not putting another penny in thir pocket so they can use to expand their backyard business. I simply walk across street to dunkin or brew my own coffee at home.

				No, they weren&#039;t at Crescent Lounge, I was coming from having a drink there. They were in front of the bodega on the corner which is indeed a bodega. I had just bought toilet paper there so I wasn&#039;t hallucinating. They weren&#039;t playing that at the time, but they were indeed playing extremely, crazy-loud music. They weren&#039;t the crowd that Crescent Lounge attracts and Crescent Lounge never plays music loudly. If anything they have people standing directly outside of the bar smoking not blaring insanely loud hip hop out of a souped up car. Unless you were referring to Broadway Sports Bar which does attract some loud and often obnoxious people.

				I think TJT&#039;s suggestion is a good one. There is nothing wrong with suggesting that a person see things for themselves so that they can make up their own mind and opinions about a situation. I can&#039;t see how that is unreasonable. Besides, if someone is asked, &quot;does the Strand make excessive noise in the backyard?&quot; it&#039;s much more convincing if the answer is &quot;yes, I heard it with my own ears&quot; instead of &quot;yeah, I heard about it from some guy on an internet message board.&quot;
