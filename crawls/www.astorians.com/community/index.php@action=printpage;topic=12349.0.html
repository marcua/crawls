				I though this subject might be of interest to other singles on the board - dating no-nos based on harsh experience. <br /><br />A Guy&#039;s Guide to Not Getting it On (Jezebel) (http://jezebel.com/5051963/a-guys-guide-to-not-getting-it-on)<br /><br />How to not get it on (Feministe) (http://www.feministe.us/blog/archives/2008/09/19/how-not-to-get-it-on/)<br /><br />Dating Don&#039;ts (Broadsheet) (http://www.salon.com/mwt/broadsheet/2008/09/19/dating_donts/index.html)<br /><br />Based on my own experiences, here are my dating don&#039;ts: <br /><br />1. After I tell you I&#039;ve just found out I&#039;m being laid off, don&#039;t insist on taking me to a chi-chi bar after I&#039;ve suggested a cheaper place, order a second pitcher of drinks after I&#039;ve said I&#039;ve had enough, and then when the bills comes tell me I owe half. <br /><br />2. If you talk about your use of hard drugs as something you are proud of, rather than part of your misspent youth - or if you show up high for our first date - I am not interested. I am freaked out. <br /><br />3. Don&#039;t scold our waiter over a trivial point to impress me. You&#039;ve just inspired him to spit in our appetizer. <br /><br />4. After I&#039;ve said &quot;no thank you&quot; once or twice, stop trying to get me to come into your apartment for a drink. <br /><br />5. Trying to rapidly lick the back of my throat is not an acceptable kissing technique. <br /><br />6. Don&#039;t tell me about your ex, except in passing. If you are talking about another woman (who is not Sarah Palin or Hillary Clinton) with passion, resentment, or anger for more than 60 seconds while on a date with me, you should not be on a date with me. <br /><br />7. Don&#039;t bring me a Dr. Wayne Dyer tape or CD (oddly, this has happened to me on 2 first dates, with 2 different guys)<br /><br />8. Don&#039;t chew gum, especially not with your mouth open. Ewww. <br /><br />9. If I can tell within one second of meeting you that you&#039;ve severely stretched the truth on your match.com profile ... why the hell did you bother? <br /><br />10. If we are walking down the street, do not stay a few steps ahead of me as if you are afraid someone may see us together. After you&#039;ve already spent the evening being incredibly cagey about what you do and who you are, I think I&#039;ve got this picture. <br /><br />11. DON&#039;T SAY I&#039;LL CALL YOU. I know what that means. There&#039;s nothing wrong with just saing &quot;It was nice to meet you.&quot;

				Haha, enigmacat--I couldn&#039;t agree more with you!&nbsp; I was on a date last week with a guy that kept talking about his ex--about how glad he was to be out of that relationship and about how horrible she was.&nbsp; Anyone who would talk negatively about someone they once thought the world of obviously has no respect for the people they date and that&#039;s not someone I want to be involved with.&nbsp; THEN I found out that he still lives with his parents--at 30 years old!&nbsp; Definitely won&#039;t be seeing him again...<br /><br />Other &quot;Don&#039;ts&quot;:<br />1.&nbsp; Being a downer.&nbsp; No negative talk about life.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to hear about how horrible his job, family, friends, financial situation is.&nbsp; He must see the positive side of things.<br />2.&nbsp; Telling a dumb joke and then laughing at it.&nbsp; I guess that&#039;s just my personal pet peeve, though.<br />3.&nbsp; I&#039;m a vegetarian and get the same stupid questions from everyone.&nbsp; (&quot;What do you eat?&quot;--duh, I eat food just like everyone else!)&nbsp; I don&#039;t make a big deal of it and am not difficult with regards to restaurant selection, so I don&#039;t see why anyone else would make an issue of it.<br />4.&nbsp; Talking about money--how much he makes, how much things cost, etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Oh, that reminds me of one more: <br /><br />A friend of mine went on a date and mentioned to the guy that she was a vegetarian. He started talking about how much he LOVED hunting deer. After he talked about the thrill of the kill for a few minutes, she figured that at least he wasn&#039;t interested and at most he was being a jerk. <br /><br />A few days later he called and wanted to go out again!

				Wow, I&#039;m surprised with how many in each list I disagree with!<br /><br />I think the better tactic is probably to just be yourself. If you&#039;re a crass kinda guy at heart and you don&#039;t already hold back in public, why would you want a lady who would expect that? If you&#039;re at heart a little crass, but you keep it in when you&#039;re out, you&#039;ll already do that for a lady!<br /><br />In my limited dating time, I found that what is way worse than hearing a gross story on the first date is finding out after five that they&#039;re like that. Imagine if your vegetarian friend didn&#039;t find out until after several weeks that the guy was a big hunter? How would that ever work out in the end? While it was rude for him to rant about it, I would think that would be a pretty big hurdle!

I would rather know that Mr. Handsome has a coke habit up front. However, these are things that make me not want to go out with someone again - precisely because they were themselves, and I can see that their real selves are just not good matches for me. And I&#039;m grateful that I was able to get that information right away and move on to look for a better match. <br /><br />I&#039;m really going more for the humor value here than trying to actually dispense advice.&nbsp; :) I&#039;m sure there are plenty of stories about women, too... <br /><br />I&#039;m trying to think of horrible dating faux pas I have made. There&#039;s the time I was on a date with a cop and made him jaywalk with me across 42nd street. He didn&#039;t call me. :)

				Odenhal, you sir, are funny as hell.<br /><br />I already told this story somewhere else on this site, but...<br /><br />I once went out on a date with a girl who was living with her ex-boyfriend. And who kept hinting that she wanted to move out (and in with someone) the entire time we were out. I did end up taking her back to my place, although I think she was more interested in checking out my place and measuring for curtains than sleeping with me. Afterwards I proceeded to utilize the &quot;not answering my phone&quot; technique. Part of me was still afraid she&#039;d show up at my door one day with a suitcase since she knew where I lived.<br /><br /><br />I also once tipped a cabbie $20 for an $8 cab ride because my date was seriously in danger of throwing up in his cab. He didn&#039;t understand and tried to give it back, but I insisted. She held out long enough to make it into my apartment and into the bathroom before losing it. Good times.

				I hate meeting women at bars and talking to them for a bit, buying them a drink and once the drink is in their hand, _then_ they mention they have a boyfriend.<br /><br />I also hate it when women that I&#039;ve just introduced myself to ask me to buy them a drink.

I always presume people are just being nice and in it for the conversation. I have bought people drinks on a number of occasions without any intentions behind them, but I&#039;m a drunk. (It says so over there &lt;------)<br /><br />I like talking to strangers and I never know when to insert the fact that I&#039;m in a relationship.<br /><br />It&#039;s kinda hard to just slip it in, I think, but if you have any ideas of when or how, that would be cool info for me.

				From my end, I&#039;d really appreciate it when the guy manages to work in some mention of his girlfriend if he has one. Suggestions (could also insert &quot;boyfriend&quot; where applicable:<br /><br />Oh, my girlfriend loves that restaurant. <br />My girlfriend hates that show. <br />I like this tie too, my girlfriend got it for me. <br />My girlfriend couldn&#039;t come out with me tonight, she&#039;s having her ears waxed. <br />I think my girlfriend is in the mafia. <br />
