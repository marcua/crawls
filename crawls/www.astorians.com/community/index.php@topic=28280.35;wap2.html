			<br />--- Quote from: 28Grand on February 12, 2015, 03:18:41 PM ---To follow up on this story, the convicted child molester placed in a shelter for families has been removed.<br /><br /><br />http://www.timesledger.com/stories/2015/6/costaspeech_tl_2015_02_06_q.html<br /><br /><br />holyfrjole, I&#039;m in total agreement with you but I wanted to ask, do you have any insight why this individual was placed at the Westway? To me, it plays right into the fears of residents living near the shelter and promotes distrust between residents and the city. If Westway is supposed to house families, this was a very poor decision for everyone.<br /><br />--- End quote ---<br /><br /><br />Honestly, I don&#039;t know how this person ended up there. Keep in mind, there are families with young children living there, and it&#039;s not in the city&#039;s best interest to put anyone at risk, especially when they&#039;re relying on the city to provide safe housing.<br /><br /><br />The residents in the shelter deserve to be as safe as the residents outside of the shelter.<br /><br />
