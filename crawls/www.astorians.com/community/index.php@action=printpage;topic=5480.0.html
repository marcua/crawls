				Two nights ago, a fire in the Highbridge section of the Bronx took the lives of 9 people in one house.&nbsp; The local news channels, for the most part, dedicated the first fifteen minutes of their broadcast to this tragedy.&nbsp; <br /><br />My condolences go out to the family and friends of the victims.&nbsp; This is so sad&nbsp; :-(&nbsp; <br /><br />http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/09/nyregion/09cause.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin<br /><br />I&#039;m trying to find a place where I can donate clothes and money.&nbsp; I thought one of the television stations had a list of charities on their website, but my office blocks certain sites and I couldn&#039;t find anything.&nbsp; Could anyone possibly find the information and post it?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				My school is collecting clothes and money.&nbsp; The kids&#039; cousins go to my school and their uncle works at my school.&nbsp; It is very heartbreaking.&nbsp; If anyone would like to meet up I can bring stuff in to the school, PM me.&nbsp; We are in the process of getting clothing sizes, too.&nbsp; I will get you an update.

				Ways to Help Families Affected<br /><br />Local mosques and a school are gathering donations to help send the bodies back to Mali for burial.<br /><br />Religious and elected officials were at the Islamic Leadership School in Parkchester this morning. They say the money raised will help the Soumare and Magassa families rebuild their lives.<br /><br />&quot;We are praying for the families who have been in tremendous pain,” said Sheikh Drammeh Islam of the Islamic Leadership School. “But we all are praying for the ones that have already left, we pray that god give them easy settling wherever they are now.”<br /><br />&quot;We have in the Bronx 1.4 million residents and we are rich in diversity, but this is time for us to speak in one voice in a unified front regardless of race and religion or ethnicity and to help this family and I think we are seeing that this is a time when you see the best out of Bronxites,” said Assemblyman Ruben Diaz Jr.<br /><br />Donations for the families can be sent to:<br /><br />Magassa-Soumare Family Foundation<br />c/o Islamic Cultural Center<br />371 East 166th Street<br />Bronx, NY 10456<br /><br />Mosques throughout the metropolitan area are also collecting money for funeral services for the victims of the fire.<br /><br />The African Services Committee is also accepting donations to support both families displaced by the fire. For more information, call 212-222-3882 or go to www.africanservices.org.<br /><br />Taxi drivers are collecting money for Soumare. To help, send a check made out to Mamadou Soumare, care of the New York State Federation of Taxi Drivers at:<br /><br />5811 Fourth Avenue<br />Brooklyn, NY 11220<br />(718) 492-7680 <br /><br />****Note:&nbsp; This is from NY1.com
