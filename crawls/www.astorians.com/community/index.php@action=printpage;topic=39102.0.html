				<br />The location of the (to me) uninteresting Stix on 30th Avenue at 40th St. is soon to be the relocation of Warique, a Peruvian restaurant that&#039;s been on the Upper West Side for several years:<br />&nbsp;http://astoriapost.com/peruvian-restaurant-moving-to-astoria-from-manhattan/ (http://astoriapost.com/peruvian-restaurant-moving-to-astoria-from-manhattan/)<br /><br /><br />A glance at their menu makes it look like a welcome addition to the neighborhood (though I&#039;d like to see more vegetarian options):<br /><span style="font-family: verdana;" class="bbc_font">http://wariquenyc.com/ (http://wariquenyc.com/)</span>

				Has anyone been yet? It&#039;s now open, but they don&#039;t have a liquor license yet. I just called to ask, and they said they don&#039;t have it yet, but hope to next week.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I went there and asked for a menu to take with me and they said they couldn&#039;t give me one.&nbsp; I thought that was strange and it really made me not want to go to this restaurant.&nbsp; I think I will try Mezquite, the Mexican/Peruvian restaurant on 30th and 46th St.

				Restaurants without menus to take away are annoying. This one does have their menu online (http://wariquenyc.com/menu/).<br /><br />I’ve tried the place once. The Auguadita de Pollo (chicken soup with vegetables) is good and warming on a cold night. I had Lomo Saltado (sautéed beef over fries)&nbsp; was well prepared and presented, but not to my taste. I had some sort of Peruvian blue-corn soda that was very sweet with a flavor of cinnamon and cloves.<br /><br />Service was attentive and friendly. I find the decor attractive.<br /><br />They seem to have solved the inadequate heat and cold drafts that made an earlier restaurant in the same space uncomfortable.<br /><br />It seemed expensive. When I go back, I expect it will be for the lunch-special menu.

				I have dined here and ordered take out...both experiences were great. If you like Peruvian Rotisserie chicken with spicy green sauce...this is the spot. The sides are also quality.
