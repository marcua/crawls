				Here&#039;s your answer, Frappe:<br /><br />http://www.truthinjustice.org/scars.htm<br /><br />According to the article, Texas prisoners received $25,000 per year of incarceration, total not to exceed $500,000, plus one year of counseling<br /><br />I didn&#039;t read the article but I wonder if you accept the money you cannot sue for wrongful conviction.&nbsp; <br /><br />And speaking of this topic: http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/03/nyregion/03tankleff.html?em&amp;ex=1199509200&amp;en=ea8a74f6f2ba27d1&amp;ei=5087%0A<br /><br />Also, there is the Pallidium case from 1990:<br /><br />http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/03/nyregion/03palladium.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin<br /><br />Interesting and very frightening stuff.

				There was a great documentary regarding people who were wrongfully committed of crimes.&nbsp; <br /><br />I highly recommend it: After Innocence<br /><br />http://www.afterinnocence.com/ (http://www.afterinnocence.com/)

				I saw &quot;After Innocence&quot; - I highly recommend it as well. There are a LOT of people who serve terms and are later proved innocent through DNA evidence.<br /><br />At the screening for &quot;After Innocence&quot; one of them men in the film came to talk about his experiences. I was amazed at the (seeming) lack of bitterness that this guy had over serving years in prison over being at the wrong place at the wrong time.<br /><br />The Innocence Project is heavily involved in getting innocent people out of jail. It&#039;s based here in NYC, and you can find out about volunteering here:<br /><br />http://www.innocenceproject.org/about/Opportunities-Volunteer.php

				it seems this story happens more and more often.<br /><br />this is the main reason i&#039;m against the death penalty.&nbsp; imagine if all of these innocent people were convicted and then executed? <br /><br />until the legal system is perfect (which it will never), we can&#039;t have the death penalty.&nbsp; if one person is wrongly executed, it&#039;s too much.&nbsp; at least with a prison sentence, people have the opportunity to be exonerated.&nbsp; they might not get those years back, but at least they&#039;ll have the chance to TRY and start their lives over.

				Well now I have a mission to see After Innocence.&nbsp; <br /><br />Some of those compensations are pretty low, especially New Hampshires!&nbsp; I&#039;d figure that even if there was no Nifonging involved, the state ought to compensate alot more, I&#039;d think a hundred grand a year if there was no malicious intent on the part of the state.<br /><br />Still wouldn&#039;t be worth 2.6&nbsp; million to be locked up for 26 years though or even ten times that much&nbsp; :|
