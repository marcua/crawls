Almost all of the planned 74 projects went ahead despite the weather; volunteers raked leaves; removed trash and winter debris; pruned trees and bushes; painted murals and community centers; repaired fences; planted hundreds of shrubs and bulbs and completed numerous other tasks to revitalize the community spaces we all enjoy.&quot;<br /><br />http://www.nycares.org/volunteer/annual_events/honyd/index.php?site=party<br /><br />After Party photos 2006<br />

				I know it is still early.<br /><br />If there would be serious interest from Astoria, willing to work at a park in other boroughs, I would be glad to facilitate a volunteer group from Astoria. Looking for 10 + good men and women. (Or maybe not so good is just as fine.)<br /><br />Cheers.<br /><br /><br />***<br />Otherwise, I might just saddle up with Uncle Telly.<br />Could make for a raw day.<br /><br /><br />

				I wont ask for any serious committments until we have 10... + names to work with.<br />Team hats would be nice, but the main focus is whatever garden or park is assigned.<br /><br />And, we would likely be a small group teamed with other groups.<br /><br />If you have never done this, I think most volunteers give <strong>enthusiastic </strong> feedback.<br />I like NY Cares because for the most part they have their act together.<br /><br /><br />For now:<br /><br />Flooz<br />Alexa<br />TRX<br />...<br />Uncle Telly?<br />...<br /><br /><br />However Flooz, I might ask for an energetic team song to energize the group that morning.

They would like to have more involvement and be involved more in the outer boroughs, espcially in Queens.<br /><br />I will also try to find other areas where they are active in Queens.

				Great job all. I am very pleased with developments so far.<br />&nbsp;:-D<br /><br />One quick note, I understand that there is <span class="bbc_u">no </span> mandatory orientation for volunteers.<br />However, if you may wish to be involved more with NY Cares after April 21, they and I would strongly <span class="bbc_u">recommend</span> it. Orientations take place several times throughout the year and help you participate in a variety of efforts throughout the year around the city. (including locally)<br /><br />I will try to send out an update to team members of who is participating regularly. <br />The team link is a little different than I remember from the past, as I thought you would see who all has joined.<br />If you need early confirmation of your team participation, Duluoz Cats and I may do so.<br /><br />Many thanks. Cheers.<br /><br />

				10 counts as full, but all that means is we won&#039;t get split up with other teams (yay!). The total number of team members can be way more than 10, so you can still join up with the AstoriaCares group without a problem, and if you haven&#039;t and still want to ... go ahead and sign up folks!!

				**<br />thanks for all who came out to help with Astoria Park; Goodwill Park; and the rest of the city. Hope to see many of you again another season.<br />Cheers!&nbsp; &nbsp;:-D<br />**<br /><br /><br />http://www.ny1.com/ny1/content/index.jsp?stid=8&amp;aid=68977<br /><br /><br /><strong>Volunteers Throughout The Five Boroughs Beautify NYC</strong><br />&nbsp; <br />April 22, 2007<br /><br />Many people took advantage of the great spring weather Saturday while participating in a little spring cleaning. As NY1&#039;s Ruschell Boone explains in the following report, the volunteers say they didn&#039;t mind breaking a sweat because it was their way to give back to the city. <br /><br />It was a great day to be in the Astoria Park Pool, even though those inside were just cleaning it out. <br /><br />Saturday dozens of volunteers from New York Cares spent several hours getting rid of the debris that accumulated over the winter. <br /><br />One rubber ducky found was probably from last summer. &nbsp;<br /><br />&quot;It&#039;s fun actually, because I&#039;ve never volunteered for anything before,” said participant Katrina Thomas. “This is really cool, a hands on project. I like it.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;I love to swim and what better way to help out than coming out here and helping out cleaning out the pool,” said Alejandra Acosta, another volunteer. <br /><br />The cleanup was part of the New York Cares 13th annual Hands on New York Day. <br /><br />Volunteers worked to revitalize community centers, parks, gardens, and other public spaces in all five boroughs. More than 4,000 people signed up to help out. <br /><br /><strong>&quot;It&#039;s our biggest turnout ever and the volunteers are willing, so we&#039;re just thrilled to make today happen,” said New York Cares Executive Director Ariel Zwang.</strong> <br /><br />In Manhattan, more than 200 volunteers from HSBC worked to improve the Lower East Side Ecology Center. They painted fences, renovated benches, planted flowers, and spread wood chips among other things. <br /><br />&quot;I&#039;m sort of covered in black,” said HSBC President and Chief Executive Officer Paul Lawrence. “I&#039;ve been moving soil and spreading mulch, but it&#039;s great.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;This is the largest waterfront park below 59th Street and like with many big parks, we have a lot of areas that need more maintenance than the Parks Department can really provide,” said Christine Datz Romero of the LES Ecology Center. “So today we have a fantastic opportunity to really get a head start on the season.&quot; <br /><br />The event marked the end of national volunteer week, and many of the workers say they will be back next year to do it all over again. <br /><br />-Ruschell Boone&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />http://www.nycares.org/volunteer/annual_events/honyd/index.php<br /><br />It was a perfect spring day on April 21, when more than 4,000 caring New Yorkers helped take spring cleaning to a new level by cleaning, painting and revitalizing our city&#039;s public spaces, including: parks, gardens, playgrounds, community centers, homeless shelters and schools. Thank you to everyone who helped to transform 89 sites across the five boroughs, making them cleaner, greener and ready for summer. <br /><br />Check back soon to view photos from the day. <br /><br />
