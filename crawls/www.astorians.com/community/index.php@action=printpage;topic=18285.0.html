				Hey fellow astorians!<br /><br />I&#039;m a 25 year french girl who spent 2 years in Astoria back in 2007/8 when I was in NYC for college and internships. <br /><br />In September&nbsp; I am relocating to NYC ( from Paris, France!) to work and there is no other place in NY where I would rather to live than in Astoria! <br /><br />Being a young professional and having experienced the sharing situation, I am feeling like finding my own apartment...but prices seem to have increased during the past 2 years! I know our beloved &#039;hood has become hip, but come on :))<br /><br />So my question is : is it possible to find a decent 1-BR in the Broadway/30th ave ( 30th to 39th st) for 1100 (possibly 1200) ?<br /><br />Thanks for your input guys! <br />

				Yes, it is possible (I found one last year on Craigslist for $1050 with no broker&#039;s fee), but not very likely.&nbsp; If you find one, be ready for it to be a &quot;fixer-upper&quot;.&nbsp; Good luck with your search.

				I know exactly how you feel amissan,<br /><br />I&#039;ve lived in Astoria my entire life...... i&#039;m 34 yrs old &amp; I have seen the neighborhood inside out...... &amp; the rents are crazy...<br />I&#039;m on the same boat as you, currently i&#039;m looking for a 1 bdrm apt in the Ditmars neighborhood no higher than $1100. I KNOW its possible..... you just have to get lucky I guess??<br />My current apt is GREAT...... &amp; my landlord is wonderful, but its a 2 bdrm &amp; I can&#039;t keep paying the entire rent on my own. My roommate moved out about a yr ago &amp; I tried my best at staying.... but now? its just too much.&nbsp; &nbsp;:cry:
