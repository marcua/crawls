				I heard they&#39;re going to be opening another Thai restaurant a few doors down from Wave Thai on 31stg Street.&nbsp; It used to be a photography studio.&nbsp; Has anyone else heard about it?&nbsp; I thought it was strange that it would be so close to another Thai restaurant.

				It seems like there are quite a few asian restaurants popping up around our neighborhood, and since I love asian food, I say - the more the merrier.

				I really, really wish a decent Chinese place would open up. And by decent, I just mean edible. The plethora of horrid Chinese take-out in Astoria is really depressing.

Real Chinese cooking is not notably greasy (especially compared to, say, Southern American food!), and has a wide variety of excellent flavors. Take-out Chinese is not authentic, it&#39;s an invention created specifically for American tastes, using a few sauces and techniques from only a couple of regions of China. <br /><br />Wikipedia on American Chinese Food (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Chinese_cuisine)<br />Helen Fong on real Chinese food (http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/h/x/hxf140/assign7.html)<br /><br />This said, I love Thai food too, so I&#39;m not complaining about a new Thai place, only that there aren&#39;t good Chinese places in the neighborhood!

				On my own wish list would be an affordable Japanese/sushi place (not just lunch specials.)<br /><br />Thai food is good, but isn&#39;t it a lot more fattening than Chinese? That&#39;s what kept me from going into the new place on 23rd Ave. tonight. <br /><br />But I&#39;ve got the take-out menu! :-D

				There are two places I hear are good for Japanese (though I don&#39;t eat that much as I&#39;m not into seafood, and sushi scares me).&nbsp; Bai down on Broadway near 37th Street and the one up on 31st Avenue near 37th Street.&nbsp; Have you tried either of them?

				My current job forces me to be on a budget, so I&#39;ve practically forgotten what sushi tastes like!! I could eat it for every meal if I could afford to. <br /><br />It&#39;s healthy, low fat, full of flavor and certainly not dangerous. Think about how much MORE careful the sushi chefs have to be, otherwise people all over the city and Asia would be poisoned on a regular basis. I&#39;m more frightened of cooked fast food, as there&#39;s very little care or thought put into it.<br /><br />Thanks for the recommendations, I&#39;ll have to give &#39;em a try sometime........

				I don&#39;t know if I would say that sushi is healthy.&nbsp; About Thai food being more fattening than Chinese, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true.&nbsp; I find it to be less greasy and I think they give much bigger portions at chinese restaurants.

A little tingle on the lips with fugu, a bit of brain damage from the maguro... <br /><br />My understanding is unless you are a pregnant or nursing woman, or are eating tuna every day, it&#39;s pretty unlikely to be a problem. And the amount of tuna in a couple of pieces of sushi is considerably less than what&#39;s on a tuna salad sandwich at the deli, so I&#39;d worry about that more...

				Back to the chinese restaurant comments; after 13 yrs in Astoria ive given up. Chinese take here is good for fried chicken wings, pan fried dumplings and pork egg foo young and thats it.&nbsp; And none of that is something you want to eat on a regular basis.<br /><br />A decent Vintnamese place would be welcome and so would a really top notch sushi joint.&nbsp; Id say that sushi is some of the healthiest foods around.&nbsp; The dish even comes with antibacterial condiments (wasabi and ginger).&nbsp; MMMMM.... eel and avocado roll, spicy tuna and wakame salad.

				I love Asian food... But I prefer go to China Town to get the real thing (at least I know it&#39;s not mexican-chinese!! 8-)) Is there anything worse than mexicans trying to cook chinese food?? About Thai food, I love Thai Pavillion, they are great and it&#39;s really affordable. Japanese restaurants are easier to find, but definetly Watawa in Ditmars is my favourite!&nbsp; :-)

Many or most of the cooks in New York City, including at the white-tablecloth French places, are from Mexico or Central America. Just as I can learn to cook Chinese food, if I put my mind to it, so can Mexicans learn to cook Chinese food. It&#39;s about training and skill, not about where you grew up. See my previous comment (http://astorians.com/index.php?topic=2324.msg16166#msg16166) on this topic...<br /><br />I did like Thai Pavilion the one time I&#39;ve been there. Have you been to JJ&#39;s for sushi? I rather like their fusion dishes, like some very memorable apple tuna sashimi...<br />
