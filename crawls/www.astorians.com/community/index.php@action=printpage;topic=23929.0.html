				&nbsp;Hi all!<br />There are a few posts about daycares, and only one about some particular pre-k.<br />Please share what pre- k you go to, what was the waiting list, what you like or don&#039;t like about these places. <br />I am looking for both pre- k as a separate facility and within a daycare, preferably close to 36 av and 30 th st.<br />So far I have heard many good reviews about Bright Beginnings and Astoria Daycare- did anyone go there just for the pre- k program?<br />I am new to Astoria and a new mom as well, so I would appreciate all advices;)

				Most precious blood has a good program....if you are looking for free 2.5 hours pre k they have that too. <br /><br />Around 36 ave you may want to look into Evangel on crescent and 39th ave.<br /><br /><br />

				My daughter goes to Most Precious Blood.&nbsp; She really loves it. She gives the teacher a hug good-bye every day.&nbsp; She&#039;s been going to MPB since nursery school.&nbsp; <br /><br />I also friends who have children at Queensview and at Queens Lutheran (formerly Grace Lutheran) who also are pleased with the pre-k programs there.<br />

				Not the subject I know, but MPB also has a great Mommy and Me program on Monday and Wednesday mornings for 1.5 hours.&nbsp; We loved it when our son was 2.&nbsp; &nbsp;The staff is great, and they look to have a great nursery program too.&nbsp; &nbsp;
