				I&#039;ve been here for 20 years and the pace of development has picked up rapidly in recent years.&nbsp; &nbsp;There is construction literally on every block and the demographics are rapidly changing.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Here are some of the places (before I forget) I went to or remember.<br /><br />I&#039;ll start with a few restaurants.<br /><br />I remember way, way back my mother was visiting from out of town and we went to a little Italian neighborhood restaurant (much like the recently closed Rizzo&#039;s) that was on 30th Avenue just west of Crescent Street.&nbsp; &nbsp;The one-story building that housed the place was demolished and a slim office building, housing mostly medical offices, went up in its stead.&nbsp; The restaurant was called The Lanterna.<br /><br />On the west side of 21st Street, just north of Broadway, was a steak house that I never did get a chance to patronize.&nbsp; &nbsp;The building was demolished and an apartment building was put up on the site.&nbsp; &nbsp;A block further north was the restaurant&#039;s parking lot, which is now where McDonald&#039;s is located.<br /><br />On my corner (or one of my corners) 30th Avenue &amp; 34th Street three of the four businesses are new since I moved to this location in Astoria in &#039;01.&nbsp; &nbsp;That shows you how fast things change.&nbsp; The southwest corner is a Spanish restaurant that I believe was there when I moved in.&nbsp; &nbsp;I can&#039;t remember what was on the southeast corner where that Japanese restaurant that was recently closed by the NYC Health Dept. now is, but when I moved in it was &quot;European style&quot; restaurant that was open 24 hours.&nbsp; It had just opened or was about to open.&nbsp; &nbsp;It served crepes and the owner parked his car, which boldy advertised the business, in front of the place.&nbsp; &nbsp;The &quot;European style&quot; must have bombed because it wasn&#039;t open long before closing. The storefront didn&#039;t say empty for long because the Japanese place opened immediately.<br /><br />On the northeast corner a hardware store (which I wish was still there; lord to we need more of these in Astoria) was going just as I was coming.&nbsp; &nbsp;A restaurant opened that I patronized and liked.&nbsp; They had great burgers and had a terrific breakfast.&nbsp; &nbsp;They had a backroom that opened onto 34th Street that was a bar I think and they tried to make a go of the bar by featuring belly dancers for a brief period.&nbsp; &nbsp;I must have been one of the few who liked the place because there was never anyone in the restaurant and I wasn&#039;t surprised to see it closed.&nbsp; &nbsp;I was actually going there to eat and found it closed.&nbsp; &nbsp;Surprise.&nbsp; Surprise.&nbsp; Surprise.&nbsp; A new restaurant, with al fresco dining, appears to be doing real well.<br /><br />On the northeast corner was a convenience store catering to an Indian or South Asian clientele.&nbsp; It closed and a cell phone store, which was located across the street, moved in.&nbsp; &nbsp;Next to the cell phone store, on the north side of 30th Avenue between 33rd and 34th Streets, for a brief period was an Indian desert or sweets shop that lasted about a minute.&nbsp; I can&#039;t remember what was in that space before the sweets shop.&nbsp; &nbsp; It was kind of pathetic because no one ever went in there and the store display featured cans of soda lined up in a semi-circle surrounded by a big bag of potato chips.&nbsp; &nbsp;It was kind of cute it was so low budget.&nbsp; &nbsp;The place quickly closed and since then an Internet access place has opened and appears to be doing well.<br /><br />And on the west side of 34th Street just north of 30th Avenue are four small storefronts that have completely turned over since I moved in six years ago.&nbsp; &nbsp;The first store, closest to 30th Avenue, was a cell phone store that was on its last legs when I moved in.&nbsp; &nbsp;Then, to demonstrate our neighborhood&#039;s changing demographics, was a sari shop that actually was featured in the &quot;New York Times&quot; in a feature article.&nbsp; &nbsp;The place used the same display cases as the defunct cell phone store.&nbsp; &nbsp;The woman who owned the place was a familiar sight on the street, but earlier this year the place closed and it is now vacant, though it was just renovated so I assume I new business is moving in.&nbsp; I was surprised the sari shop lasted as long as it did.<br /><br />Next to the cell phone store/sari shop was a shoe repair place.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t think the guy was too busy because every time I walked by he would be watching TV.&nbsp; &nbsp;His was the second business to close after the cell phone place and the site is now a travel agency that appears to cater to South Asians.<br /><br />Then the building remodeled and two businesses closed, a barber shop and a women&#039;s hair salon.&nbsp; &nbsp;I would go to the barber, an old guy name Gerry who had been there for 30 years.&nbsp; &nbsp;He was a great guy and a real character.&nbsp; &nbsp;His shop had real character as well, with much of the clutter looking like it had been there since the 1970s.&nbsp; &nbsp; Gerry was getting up there in years and couldn&#039;t see so well.&nbsp; &nbsp;I get my what remains of my hair cut real short, almost down to the skin, and after Gerry got through with me I would go home and check the mirror where I would see this long stalks of hair that Gerry missed.&nbsp; &nbsp;He worked hard, though, and he wasn&#039;t a young man.&nbsp; &nbsp;Gerry would be in there before 8 six days a week and wouldn&#039;t leave until 7.&nbsp; I&#039;d see him waiting for his son (I presume it was his son) to pick him up.&nbsp; &nbsp;The irony is that when the renovation was complete a new barbershop opened.&nbsp; &nbsp;Trouble is he charges $13 and some of the South Asian barbers a few blocks further east charge $8 so you know where I go.<br /><br />Finally, the fourth shop that never reopened after the renovation was a hair salon that looked like it had been there for years.&nbsp; &nbsp; What was odd was that a music store opened in its stead called &quot;Enisa&quot; music or something like that.&nbsp; &nbsp;It featured videos and CDs catering to people I presume from countries that were part of Yugoslavia.&nbsp; &nbsp; I was kind of surprised that a store catering to such a narrow slice of the market would open, but it didn&#039;t stay open long and closed this year.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;d walk by never see anyone in there and see the woman who worked there playing on her computer.<br /><br />More to come.

				Does anyone remember Murray&#039;s Bicycle Shop? It was like an instituion here. Every kid with a bike went to Murray. He was on 31 Ave and 42 ST (?)<br /><br />He was the best and was really a character.<br />A real old time NYer, the kind they don&#039;t make any more.

				A couple of quickies for the newbies:<br /><br />The PC Richards electronic superstore next to the Regal movie megaplex was a very good King Cullen supermarket.&nbsp; &nbsp;There was parking lot on the block before the movie &#039;plex opened.<br /><br />The bank on the northwest corner of Steinway &amp; Broadway was for years a Wiz store, the electronics store that went under.<br /><br />The Duane Reade at the corner of 30th Avenue &amp; Steinway was, until &#039;01, a six-plex movie theatre and was the only theatre in Astoria until the Regal &#039;plex opened.&nbsp; &nbsp;They went head-to-head for awhile but then Regal and United Artists, the respective owners of the two &#039;plexes, merged and the older UA &#039;plex closed its doors.&nbsp; There is a great web site called Cinema Treasures where you can read all about all the old movie theatres in Astoria.&nbsp; &nbsp;There were eight or nine of them, but all but the UA theatre were long closed by the time I moved here.&nbsp; You will be surprised to find what buildings at one time were movie theatres.<br /><br />Another corner near and dear to my heart is Broadway &amp; 32nd Street, near where I lived from &#039;87 to &#039;01.&nbsp; &nbsp; The bank at the northwest corner has been there since I&#039;ve been here, but it is one of those buildings that was originally a movie theatre.<br /><br />The northeast corner, which houses Gibneys bar, has always been a bar, but its name when I moved in was &quot;The Clover.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; Gibney&#039;s is much nicer, though I only went into the Clover once.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think you needed an AARP card to get served there.&nbsp; &nbsp;Next to Gibney&#039;s on Broadway where there is now a bar was a 99 cents store.<br /><br />The southeast corner which now houses a cafe was a Greek gift shop before the cafe opened.<br /><br />The most interesting corner is the southwest corner that now houses a convenience store and a Subway shop last time I looked.&nbsp; &nbsp;When I moved in there was a clothing store in that space that closed and merged with the clothing store on the same side of Broadway between 32nd and 33rd.&nbsp; &nbsp;The clothing store on the corner went very deep and the landlord carved up the space so there three stores that fronted on 32nd Street.&nbsp; &nbsp;There was a tiny Brazilian Restaurant, which has since expanded to have seating, a barber shop and a video store that catered to Indians or South Asians.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think the latter business is gone.&nbsp; &nbsp;And when I moved in, on the second floor, was a tailor, but that has been closed.&nbsp; &nbsp;Then some sort of leather goods store moved into the space, but that is long gone as well.

				A couple of other quickies.<br /><br />I remember when the Blockbuster, now closed, opened on the southeast corner of 34th Street &amp; Steinway.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am pretty sure the Blockbuster opened in &#039;89.&nbsp; &nbsp; Before BB a clothing store, Theo&#039;s, had the space.&nbsp; &nbsp;Theo&#039;s moved next door to smaller digs and is still open.&nbsp; &nbsp; One impact of Blockbuster&#039;s coming was the demise of the local, mom &#039;n pop video stores.&nbsp; &nbsp;There were three of them on Broadway between 32nd Street &amp; 36th/37th Streets in Astoria and two of them went under shortly after BB opened and the other, between 32 and 33 streets, lasted longer than the other two, but that is gone too.&nbsp; &nbsp;And there was a small, independent video store on 34th Street on the same block as AMMI and that went under soon after BB opened.<br /><br />Finally, I don&#039;t know if people know this, but the building on the northeast corner of Broadway &amp; 40th Street (or whatever the street is just east of Steinway) was originally a Moose Lodge.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think the building is a furniture store now, but it has a unique design and I learned from an old timer that the site was originally the lodge.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Before it was the Wiz - It was Stevens - which also had a branch on Queens Blvd. The Stevens&nbsp; neon sign flashed its letters in sequence like this<br /><br />S e e<br />Stevens<br />&nbsp; t v<br /><br />Stevens was a general store type place that had appliances and electronics, especially TV&#039;s and a decent record dept. It was a fun place to shop with good salesmen (sales people). <br />

				Stevens was gone in Astoria anyway by &#039;87.&nbsp; &nbsp;I do remember that Stevens Store on Queens Blvd., though I only drove by it; I never went in.&nbsp; &nbsp;It lasted well into the 1990s before going under.

				What ever happened to the Wiz?&nbsp; I think they all went out of business - and they used to have decent music bargains (not to mention cheap computer games).&nbsp; It was nice to have them at the Steinway/Broadway intersection.

				The Zodiac building was a large auto repair type place and later expanded into RV sales. The owner Mr. Manginello was shot dead in front of his house near Bryaant HS.It was quite a shock. I recall the police said it was some woman who shot him, loke it was acrime of passion. Others said it was a mafia hit. I don&#039;t think the killer was caught. The business tried to make a go of it with his son running it I believe, but it sunk. The building was empty for a while till Zodiac.

				One quickie:&nbsp; On the east side of 35th Street, between 31st and 30 Avenues (but close to the corner of 31st), is a Baptist Church or some sort of evangelical church.&nbsp; &nbsp;When I moved to Astoria is was a synagogue.&nbsp; &nbsp;One day I walked by and it was a church.<br /><br />Another intersection that is changing is what someone told me was the &quot;old center of Astoria&quot;&nbsp; the intersection at 21st Street where Newtown Avenue and Astoria Blvd. converge.<br /><br />The southeast corner hasn&#039;t changed as far as I can recall.&nbsp; &nbsp;There is some sort of no-name fast food joint on the corner, but that side of the block is interesting.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you walk east on Newtown there is one new apartment building that has gone up and that is occupied and what was a car repair shop on the corner of Newtown and whatever the street is that runs parallel to 21st (one block east).&nbsp; The business closed and no doubt the building will be knocked down to make way for an apartment building.&nbsp; &nbsp;One other interesting tidbit of information about that block -- or that side of the block -- is that the other auto repair shop on the block -- located mid-block -- years and years ago (long before I moved here) was a movie theatre believe it or not.&nbsp; &nbsp;You can still see the projection booth above the entrance.<br /><br />The southwest corner of the block has changed.&nbsp; &nbsp;When I moved in and for years after there was a general store or convenience store called Fishbein&#039;s, which closed.&nbsp; &nbsp;I never went in there so I am not 100% certain what kind of store it was.&nbsp; &nbsp;Next to Fishbein&#039;s was a liquor store or &quot;bottle shop&quot; as New Yorkers call them.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think the bottle shop relocated further south on 21st Street, just above 30th Avenue, into a building that was a tire repair shop.&nbsp; &nbsp;The tire repair shops on 21st Street are rapidly disappearing.&nbsp; I am not sure what the business is that replaced Fishbein&#039;s/the bottle shop, but it might be a medical facility.<br /><br />The northwest corner of the block is a now closed gas station.&nbsp; &nbsp;I assume they will throw up another apartment building.&nbsp; &nbsp;There is an apartment building currently being constructed next door to the closed gas station.&nbsp; A single-family wood-frame house was there.<br /><br />On the northeast corner of the block was until very recently a gardening shop.&nbsp; &nbsp;That closed and has been replaced by a convenience store.&nbsp; &nbsp;There used to be a butcher shop and a Korean deli/green grocer, among other businesses, on that block fronting Astoria Blvd.&nbsp; &nbsp;When the gardening shop closed I thought they were going to take the building down, but I guess not.&nbsp; &nbsp;Right next door on 21st is a relatively new senior citizens housing complex.&nbsp; &nbsp;That was a parking lot/used car dealer when I first moved here.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />On the west side of 21st, between Astoria Blvd./Newtown, is a real interesting looking building.&nbsp; &nbsp; The property is shaped like a pie wedge with the skinny end facing east.&nbsp; &nbsp;That affected the design of the building so it is kind of interesting looking.&nbsp; &nbsp; There is a Chinese take out place and a convenience store on the first floor.&nbsp; I assume apartments are located in the apartments above.&nbsp; &nbsp;On the western end of that block is a new apartment dwelling.&nbsp; &nbsp;I thought it was an odd place for an apartment building because that area isn&#039;t exactly the most aesthetically pleasing part of Astoria.&nbsp; &nbsp;But there is much development in that part of Astoria.<br /><br />And on the east side of 21st, between Astoria Blvd/Newtown, is another odd piece of property that houses a used furniture store on the western end and what was a parking lot on the eastern end of the block right across from the Catholic School/Church complex.&nbsp; &nbsp; There is another apartment building going up on that site as I write.

				One other vestige of the old days, from the Cold War actually, is the &quot;Fallout Shelter&quot; signs you still see all over Astoria.&nbsp; &nbsp; I chuckle when I see them.&nbsp; &nbsp; I wonder if people even notice them.&nbsp; &nbsp;They are yellow and usually attached to the larger apartment buildings.&nbsp; &nbsp; They are just there and probably not even noticed.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t grow up here, but was in grammar school, starting in the mid 1960s when we were in the height of the Cold War when the Commies ruled Russia.&nbsp; &nbsp; The morons who ran the country had us -- this is unbelievable when I think about it now -- doing drills to prepare for a nuclear attack.&nbsp; &nbsp; They had us hiding under our desks as if that would help if the Russkies lobbed a nuclear bomb on our heads.&nbsp; &nbsp;Then they changed the policy and had us file out into the corridor and press our faces against the wall.&nbsp; &nbsp;I always remember this, but the first time they opted to move us out of the class into the corridor one guy hid under his desk and wouldn&#039;t get up and come with the rest of us into the corridor.&nbsp; &nbsp;We had this old woman as a teacher and she got all upset because they guy refused to get out from under this desk.<br /><br />In any event, as part of that lunacy the government had set up fallout shelters all over the country, actually stocking them with food and water.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t know exactly when they came to their senses and ended the drills I had to suffer through -- probably late sixties -- but you still see the vestiges of that era throughout Astoria in the form of the air raid shelter signs.

				Another corner I know well is Steinway &amp; Broadway.&nbsp; &nbsp;The corner doesn&#039;t look all that different from when I moved to the neighborhood almost 20 years ago, but all four businesses on the corner have changed.<br /><br />On the southwest corner is a Chase Bank.&nbsp; &nbsp;It looks exactly as it did when I moved here, only it was a Chemical Bank back then.&nbsp; &nbsp;Chemical Bank has since merged with Manufacturers Hanover and dropped the &quot;Mannie Hannie&quot; name as we used to call it and used the Chemical brand name.&nbsp; &nbsp;Chemical then bought Chase Bank (though they kept the Chase name for the combined bank).&nbsp; Since then Chase and J.P.

				TSS, where the dollar store is now, Bway btw. 36th and 37th. <br /><br />Strand movie theater... strand bowling alley... bway btw. cresecent and 29th...<br /><br />Dirt Mall where the Trade Fair is at Bway and Crescent...<br /><br />I forget what Sac&#039;s was before it was Sacs... anyone care to jog my memory? I do recall going in there when it first opened. It was just a regular pizza place. Not fancy at all. Same good food though.<br /><br />Oh and there was an exterminator across 29th st. from it. They had some funny name I can&#039;t recall... I think...<br /><br /><br /><br />All of them fallout shelter signs... I have one from my parent&#039;s building here. There were survival rations in the basement. Drums of water and boxes of crackers. I think they cleared it out in the late 80s...<br /><br />The movie theater on 35th av. was a parking lot for Kaufman studios. There was apparently an old army bunker under it (small, nothing too fancy) with a ping pong table (relative worked there and found it)<br /><br />RR running on the el... Then the R... Then the B during rush hours... then the switch to the N and actual clean graffitiless trains that didn&#039;t break down every single day.<br /><br />Hell Gate getting painted for the first time since it was built, mid 90s. <br /><br />Peter Vallone Sr.<br /><br />114th pct. at 30th av in what became the hanac building west of crescent. <br /><br />Astoria General.<br /><br />261 (well, they were closed just a few years ago). <br /><br />Typin Steel (now CostCo). <br /><br />L.I.C. H.S. &amp; those new houses land as one huge empty lot with scattered abandoned cars and trash.<br /><br />&quot;Yonkers Construction&quot; and that ridiculous project on 31st av where they dug a huge hole for miles in either direction (or so it seemed) taking up parking spots and attracting bugs and rats and trash. <br /><br />Vigilante neighborhood people setting the yonkers construction trailer on fire july 4 night @ 31st av and 30th street. (it was like 3 or 4 AM...)<br /><br />the old houses at 31st av and 30th street. then the empty lot, the demo of the house next door... (and now them new fancy ones put up there...)<br /><br />The &#039;Slayer&#039; abandoned house, 31st. av south of crescent...<br /><br />I&#039;ll think of more later...

A girl in my class lived over it and I think was out sick for awhile due to the stench.<br /><br />Years later her mom, very nice woman, was killed by some jilted ex lover or something on the E train in jamacia...<br /><br />&#039;and so it goes&#039;...

				When you mentioned the Strand it jogged some memories.<br />As a kidI saw Tv host Chuck McCann make an appearance there with his puppeteer. He did a whole show including his &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot;.<br /><br />This reminded me of personal appearances I saw at The Loews Triboro - a truly grand movie palace which was made up like a Greek (or was it Egyptian?) ampitheater.The ceiling was made like a sky with twinking lights and aa smoke machine made clouds to create a sky show.<br /><br />There I saw Jerry Lewis and the Three Stooges (Although the 3rd Stooge then was &quot;Curly Joe&quot;. <br /><br />

				There still are some old stores on Broadway that have been there as long as I can remember. There&#039;s a bunch of them on the northern side of the block between 35th and 36th Streets across from Quinn&#039;s funeral home: Walter&#039;s Hardware, a fabric store, an Italian Deli, and a Polish Butcher who specializes in homemade smoked meats. For some reason, that block has so many businesses on it that have been around for at least 50 years. I can only assume the families that run these businesses long ago had the forethought to buy the buildings the stores are housed in.

				Does anyone remember the original Victory Sweet Shop on 23rd Avenue?&nbsp; It was so charming, with all of their pastries in quaint glass cases.&nbsp; It looked like a Sweet Shop (Zaharoplastion) out of 1960&#039;s Athens.&nbsp; Also, the first cafe I recall in the area was Hilton, on 31st Street off of Ditmars.&nbsp; Does anyone remember these shops?

				I remember Astoria Bootery on 31st at the Ditmars stop.&nbsp; Also, I could swear the now Fabco was a childrens store called Youth Town or something to that affect.&nbsp; Does anyone remember that?&nbsp; I remember it starting with a Y (it became Young World after the particular store I&#039;m talking about) and I remember the awning being yellow-ish.&nbsp; On a side note...I LOVED the Pergament on 31st Street between Ditmars and 21st Avenue.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t understand how they could&#039;ve gone out of business.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />

				I remember Edelweiss.&nbsp; &nbsp;It was one block east of Steinway on the south side of Broadway.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think that must be 40th Street if Steinway is &quot;39th Street.&quot;&nbsp; The old Moose Lodge is right across the street.<br /><br />A couple of other things.&nbsp; &nbsp; People may not remember this but back in the 1980s the Mets were the number 1 team in town.&nbsp; &nbsp; The Yankees were a distant second.&nbsp; &nbsp;Shea, not Yankee Stadium, was the place to go as the Mets were perennial contenders, culminating in the &#039;86 World Series.&nbsp; &nbsp; Well, the Mets, like the Yankees, started to open &quot;Mets stores&quot; where you could by Mets souvenirs, buy tickets, etc.&nbsp; &nbsp; Unfortunately, by the late 1980s/early 1990s the Mets&#039; fortunes changed and the team tanked and the &quot;Mets stores&quot; didn&#039;t take off or at least the one that was opened on Steinway didn&#039;t take off.&nbsp; &nbsp;You can still see the building on the east side of Steinway Street just north of 31st Avenue.&nbsp; &nbsp; It is the third building, right next to Wendy&#039;s I believe.&nbsp; &nbsp; The Mets redesigned the store front and if you look on the top or third floor you can still see the Mets&#039; blue and orange colors.&nbsp; &nbsp;There is a white circle still visible that has been painted over, but that was the Mets&#039; logo.<br /><br />I also seem to remember that there was a fairly large German restaurant on Steinway on the west side of the street.&nbsp; &nbsp;It was either on the block between 30th and 28th Avenue or the one between 28th Avenue and Astoria Blvd. (where all the Arab cafes now are located).&nbsp; &nbsp;Anyone remember that?&nbsp; &nbsp;I never went in, but from what I understand Astoria used to be an Irish and German neighborhood.&nbsp; &nbsp;This place must have been a vestige of that.

				I remember the old soda/candy shop on the corner of Crescent Street and Astoria Blvd. Used to go in there as a kid and purchase a small paper bag full of candy for a dollar. I also remember a delicatessen on Astoria Blvd. between Crescent Street and 27th st. the old mom and pop type, just like the soda/candy shop. Ah the memories of growing up in Astoria!

				I LOVE THIS POST!&nbsp; Does anyone have pictures of ANY of the old stores?&nbsp; I have some and would be willing to share...I would need to scan a lot of them in, but I get really nostalgic when I see them.&nbsp; I WISH I took a LOT more because so much is missing.&nbsp; One thing to do is look UNDER awnings and sometimes you will see the signs from the old stores that used to be there.&nbsp; Check out the bodega on the corner of Crescent and Broadway -- it used to be the Crescent Corner Lunchonette, a comfortable neighborhood coffee shop/greasy spoon, and you can see part of the old sign under the awning.<br /><br />Some other thoughts:<br /><br />I bowled many times at the Strand Bowling Alley on Broadway between Crescent and 29th St., now a music rehearsal studio.<br /><br />The Chinese restaurant on Broadway near Crescent used to be Wah Yuan now it is Hong Kong.<br /><br />Phil&#039;s Delicatessen on Broadway between 30th St. and 31st St.<br /><br />Dino&#039;s Pizza used to be on the southeast corner of Broadway and 30th St. and took up almost half of the block.<br /><br />The Broadway Deli used to be next to the Sanford Diner.<br /><br />Broadway Station used to be called the Broadway Tavern.<br /><br />The now-defunct Dillon&#039;s Bar on Broadway between Crescent and 29th St. used to be the Spinning Wheel.<br /><br />The North Fork Bank on the corner of Broadway and 32nd St. used to be the Greenpoint Bank for many years.<br /><br />The Marathon Bank on the corner of Broadway and 31st St. used to be Interbank.&nbsp; Marathon was about one block up on the other side but merged with Interbank.<br /><br />Apple Bank used to be around Broadway and 36th St. but closed and is now a 99 cent store.<br /><br />The Five and Dime on Broadway between Crescent and 29th St. where Blockbuster is now.<br /><br />The Carvel ice cream store in the Broadway Shopping Center on Broadway and 21st St.<br /><br />Regarding the Ranch Steak House, I remember a story about that place -- people were eating there and a bullet passed through the store.&nbsp; Everyone was momentarily stunned but went right back to eating their meals.<br /><br />Also in the Broadway Shopping Center -- the White Castle used to be a KFC, then it became a White Castle, then a White Castle/Church&#039;s Fried Chicken combo then back to White Castle alone.&nbsp; The Samaria pizzeria has been in the shopping center forever, as has the post office.<br /><br />Anyone remember Genovese?&nbsp; It became Eckerd, which is now Rite-Aid.&nbsp; So much for our neighborhood pharmacy.<br /><br />That&#039;s all for now.&nbsp; WE NEED PICTURES!!!

				As a previous poster mentioned earlier, Broadway &amp; 36th street, where Eckerd is now-before that there was a PC Richard there and before that there was a TSS store.&nbsp; It was a hardware store/small appliance store.<br /><br />Also on Broadway between Steinway &amp; 38th Street, where GEM is now, there was a Martin Paint store.&nbsp; I remember going there with my parents as a kid!&nbsp; <br /><br />I beleive there was a Woolworth on Steinway and 31st Ave where Express is now.<br /><br /><br />It is fun to remember &quot;Old Astoria&quot;!<br />

				When I was growing up in Astoria during the 1960s, my mom would take me to an ice cream parlor called Jacobi&#039;s near Immaculate Conception Church and when my dad was off from work he&#039;d take me to one called Mehlhop&#039;s between 33rd and 35th Streets on Ditmars Blvd.&nbsp; Apparently my mom&#039;s crowd from 21st Road used to hang out at Jacobi&#039;s when she was kid, so she kept going there with me after she was married.&nbsp; In my dad&#039;s case, he grew up right near Mehlhop&#039;s, so that was his favorite place.&nbsp; Jacobi&#039;s was gone by the time I was in high school but Mehlhop&#039;s, under a different name (which I&#039;ve forgotten), lasted into the 70s.

				I just remembered this yesterday as I was walking on 36th Avenue between 34th and 35th Avenues close to 36th Avenue.&nbsp; &nbsp;Remember the pedestrial footbridge that connected the Museum of the Moving Image and the Kaufman Astoria Studio across 36th Street?&nbsp; &nbsp;That truly has vanished!&nbsp; It was removed fairly recently.

				wow,&nbsp; lots of long forgotten places being brought up here..here are some more, forgive me if i&#039;m repeating any.<br /><br />-early 90&#039;s in the small storefront next to pollos mario across the street from the library there was a record shop. I was one of those people who loitered there and bought much great music in the short time the guy was there, This music critic Mike Gitter would go there and sell his promo music cd&#039;s and tapes after he was done reviewing them. I would buy new stuff for used prices instead of trekking down to St. mark&#039;s Sounds, that was great. I remember distinctly summer of 91 he was dropping a mega load of stuff and i asked him what was hot coming out music wise and he was adamant about it. He said Nirvana have a new disc and all the british music papers are calling it the second coming and by coincindence later that night I was listening to WSOU 89.5 where they played the first two tracks from nevermind and he was right, music was never the same again for me after that. I was sad when the record store guy said he was closing, i promised him to come by on his last day but I never made it. I kinda wanted to exchange numbers with him and maybe catch a show or something since we spent so many <div align="center">hours jibber jabbering&nbsp; about music. He loved Husker Du and the pixies I remember.<br /><br />--the spot where pollos ala mario is was also a hopping bar for like a year back in 1990 called babareebas, i think?<br /><br />--cookie kingdom with it&#039;s castle exterior and I think some sort of animatronic robot or doll that had a cookie that he put in his mouth?? located where queens county bank is next to the municipal parking lot.<br /><br />--sampan chinese takeout right off 30th ave and steinway next to the old UA theatre. The owner sold out a few years ago, but i remember thier fried rice had real white breast chicken and bits of scrambled egg. His style of fried rice has been long abandoned for the new style that everyone has that sucks balls.<br /><br />--across the street from sampan there was a chinese restaurant &quot;dragon china&quot;? that had booths and was like real fancy, at least to my meories from 30+ yrs ago. And i vivdly remember red..the place was RED decor and lamps etc.<br /><br />--Steinway between 30th ave and 31st where kiddie world? is now was Playworld, OUR version of toys r us since we had none that was easy to get to until they set up on 48th and northern blvd. My mom joining in on the cabbage patch line and subsequent stampede, stands out for me. and to deter loiterers or shpolifters for some time they wouldn&#039;t let kids in without an adult accompanying them. So you woul dhave to wait for an adult to go in and follow closely behind them to sneak in.<br /><br />--How about Eisenbergs a few doors down from where the dunkin donuts on steinway is now. They had china, chandeliers and all sorts of junk to litter a house with. They also had a full length 10&#039;x6&#039;mirror right next to their storefront which you could approach from like 10 feet away to get a good idea of how you looked walking. I always thought i looked too knock kneed and used to be self conscious and never missed a chance to walk to it&nbsp; trying to add a lil bow leggedness to my stride to minimize it. at least in my mind..cuckoo!!!<br /><br />--On steinway btwn 28th ave and 30th, but closer to 28th ave, Kind of where the kids afterschool tutoring learning center is now used to be S.L. Jacks, where you could buy anything electronic partswise made by all of humandom.<br />They had drawers full of fuses, wires, circuit boards. A hobbyists dream place. But I remember the staff really rude and intolerable of stupid questions, of which my 10 yr old science fair researching self had for them when trying to come up with a decent presentation one year.<br /><br />--On 31st street near ditmars for only a year or two where Keyfood is now there was a rollerskating disco rink called Roller Royce? spent A few saturday afternoons skating to hits of the late 70&#039;s and early 80&#039;s there.<br /><br />--How about astoria boulevard where now Burger King is a block before the 114th precinct. There was a huge Nathans of coney island..and in the early 80&#039;s they had a bonafide arcade room with like every video game ever made. Pure heaven!!!<br /><br />--on steinway and 35th avenue Silverscreen&#039;s disco where the young greeks and italians wore their best neon greens and espadrilles and danced to TKA. But in like 89-92 they had a weekly friday night party called Berlin where alternative music was played. I remember moshing on the dance floor to fugazi&#039;s waiting room when the dj would take a request once in a while. and since we were poor 20 yr olds we would get liquored up out back where gold gym was on 40 oz Crazy horse malt liquor. <br /><br />--on 23rd avenue and 31st street next door to sally deli was our neighborhood rundown stripbar Pennywhistles<br />skankaliciousness abound.<br /><br />--broadway around around 44th street there was a corner store that was like an arcade that i remeber the kids from jhs 10 and bryant high school hung out at?<br />&nbsp;<br />-- and finally not an establishment but a person. At the steinway subway station even to this day the panhandling light skinned black homeless lady with sunglasses. I remember seeing her back in the 80&#039;s and she still is around going strong, wow.<br /></div>

				Wow, amazing post!&nbsp; I still remember some of the things you mentioned, like Sampan and Playworld and Eisenberg&#039;s and the old dance club on 35th and Steinway, even though I was far too young to go back then.&nbsp; Only one thing I&#039;ll point out: there was, in fact, a great toy store in Astoria before Toys R&#039; Us rolled into town and aside from Playworld:&nbsp; Valco, on Steinway between 34th and Broadway.&nbsp; It was where the Lucille Roberts is now, I believe.&nbsp; That place had a treasure trove of toys including some pretty obscure stuff that one would never find in a big-box toy store like Toys R&#039; Us.&nbsp; I think it disappeared, unfortunately, sometime around 1990.<br /><br />I remember as a young kid going there with my mom, and often, stopping at the dry cleaners that was a couple of doors down next to what was the Modernage Diner (now the Astoria Diner)...Dandy Dry Cleaners was the name.&nbsp; There was a friendly old guy behind the counter (Cuban, I believe) and I seem to recall there being lollipops there sometimes as well.<br /><br />Also, on the same block but across the street, there had been a small Hershey&#039;s Ice Cream store for a few years.&nbsp; I can&#039;t remember the exact location but it was closer to 34th Avenue than to Broadway.

				I can&#039;t believe someone else remembers Mehlhops! When I was a kid my family would eat lunch there almost everyday. I can still<br />taste the great burgers.&nbsp; I also remember us going to Carvel, which was on the corner of 21st AV and 31st ST, it is today a convenience store. The Carvel was one of the stand alone drive in type places you don&#039;t see too much anymore. <br /><br />Does anyone remember Eintrach Oval? It was on 20th Ave and 37th ST. It was a soccer stadium which was torn down in the 70&#039;s<br />I believe. Today it is some type of strip mall.

				There is still a stand-alone Carvel on Steinway right off of 28th Ave. (at least the last time I was in that area!).&nbsp; Anyone remember the Carvel in the Associated Shopping Center at 21st St. and Broadway?&nbsp; It was an old-school Carvel.&nbsp; I think it closed in the late 1990s.<br /><br />I am sending out another call to fellow Astorians to look for pictures of all these old stores -- please scan them in and post!

Most people ignored the sirens.

				There were two sirens on 30th Avenue, one just west of 31st Street by the supermarket, and another one around 41st Street. They would go off at 12 noon each weekday as a test for emergency contigency purposes. I assume they are still being practiced, but since I&#039;m always at work in Manhattan during weekdays at 12 noon, I wouldn&#039;t know for sure.&nbsp; Perhaps somebody else knows?

				I remember hearing the air raid siren go off in the 1960s. It would sound for a few seconds and then fade out. I don&#039;t recall if it was every day, though. But I seem to remember it happening at least once a week around noon time. I think they stopped testing that siren sometime back in the late 1960s.<br />The one I used to hear was on top of the Broadway subway station. It was easily visible from Broadway if you were standing west of the station. It might even still be there.

The old candy store&nbsp; on the corner of PS&nbsp; 84, where&nbsp; you would&nbsp; get&nbsp; a malted, &#039;wacky packages&#039; cards and&nbsp; candy.&nbsp; Finally, you could&nbsp; walk or even drive and park anywhere, no congestion, no problem. It&#039;s all gone&nbsp; forever, like Woolworths and the Automat.&nbsp; :-(

				From what I understand, Zodiac is closed temporarily because the building owners (the Alma Realty group which seems to be in competition with the Pistillis to buy just about *everything* in Astoria) will be adding a floor or two to the structure, and new support columns will have to be added below as a result.&nbsp; Indeed it is a bit of an odd time for a cafe to close, but then again, Zodiac was never really in full competition with the cafes on 30th Avenue.&nbsp; It&#039;s bread and butter is the restaurant/Greek nightclub section, which is busiest during the winter months.

This announcement was made in Magistrate <br />CONNORTON&#039;S court, Long Island City, where Miss DOWNEY, accompanied by her <br />affanced husband, Andrew HOPPE, 21 years old, of 320 Hamilton street, and a <br />bevy of girl friends, appeared this morning to prosecute her assailant and <br />former admirer, a young Frenchman named Charles RABOUD, of 65 Bodine Street.<br />RABOUD and HOPPE had a set-to over the girl at a ball in Schuetzen Park last <br />Saturday night, capitulated and started home with Miss DOWNEY. On the way <br />home the quarrel was renewed, and when Miss DOWNEY interfered she received a <br />black eye. RABOUD was held to-day in $500 for examination next Monday.

				Hey you guys forgot Astoria Bootery and Bobbi&#039;s Beat record store! They were located around where Corfu is now. The Bootery was (if I remember correctly) the only decent shoe store in the area. Used to buy my Keds sneakers there, and guess what- there actually was a book store in business for a couple of years (1994-1995? forgot the name) under the train station, between Ditmars and 23rd Ave. around where Rosario&#039;s is.

				Was there ever an Irish bar on 36th Street (north side of the street) two blocks or so west of 31st Street.&nbsp; &nbsp;It was on the ground floor/basement level and I remember it as being large.&nbsp; &nbsp;I remember a year or so ago I was in that part of Astoria and the bar was long gone.&nbsp; &nbsp;The area is heavily South Asian and there is a South Asian food store I believe in the location where I thought an Irish bar was.&nbsp; &nbsp;It was a fairly large place -- though I never went in -- and would have been there late 80s/early 90&#039;s.&nbsp; &nbsp;Did I imagine this?<br /><br />And when I moved to Astoria I thought there were two neighborhood bars on the south side of Queensboro Plaza.&nbsp; &nbsp;I know there was one bar there until recently, but that disappeared and is now a deli/candy store.&nbsp; &nbsp;Was there ever a second bar on that side of the plaza?

				The video place on Steinway and 23rd was there until very recently, though for at least the past 15 years or so it was primarily a gift shop...the name escapes me though...some combination of CBC, CTC, CDC, etc.<br /><br />Corfu Center, on Ditmars and 31st, was also one of the first to bring video rentals to Astoria.&nbsp; The place is still there but is hanging on by a thread, pretty much just selling cigarettes and coca cola nowadays.

				On 31st and Ditmars, Woolworths, Genovese and A&amp;P, Joyce&nbsp; Leslie across&nbsp; the&nbsp; street. On the corner 31st and 21 Avenue, CARVEL&nbsp; with&nbsp; the big&nbsp; &#039;Cone&#039;&nbsp; outside&nbsp; on a&nbsp; Saturday night. Matty&#039;s&nbsp; bar&nbsp; on Ditmars where&nbsp; that&nbsp; Greek bar is&nbsp; now , &#039;Billy&#039;s Bar&nbsp; where&nbsp; &#039;Fatty&#039;s&nbsp; is&nbsp; now.

All gone or&nbsp; &#039;renovated.&#039;&nbsp; Truth is&nbsp; Astoria&nbsp; as&nbsp; I knew&nbsp; it has&nbsp; vanished, very little&nbsp; remains. Sure,&nbsp; some of the Pizzerias, and&nbsp; small shops&nbsp; like King Penny, but, it&#039;s&nbsp; mostly gone. I may be going soon, sadly, sell my place. It&#039;s&nbsp; just&nbsp; becoming too much like&nbsp; Manhattan, scary&nbsp; &#039;homeless&#039;, garbage everywhere, although many of&nbsp; the side neighborhoods&nbsp; still maintain nice&nbsp; yards and blocks, families&nbsp; have left, replaced&nbsp; by&nbsp; &#039;go-go&#039; younger&nbsp; folks. I guess&nbsp; that&#039;s&nbsp; the way it always&nbsp; is in life, but, just&nbsp; once&nbsp; I&#039;d like to go back and ride&nbsp; my bike&nbsp; down the dirt&nbsp; roads&nbsp; where&nbsp; Steinway&nbsp; Mansion used&nbsp; to be&nbsp; with&nbsp; my Buddy&nbsp; &#039;Benny&#039;, who was&nbsp; killed&nbsp; in the WTC&nbsp; attacks.&nbsp; But, like&nbsp; aging, you can&#039;t&nbsp; go back.&nbsp; :-(

				Really fun thread.<br /><br />I first moved to Astoria in the 80s and I lived over Tootsie&#039;s Bar on the Northeast corner of Steinway and 23rd Ave, anyone remember it? I think there is a different bar there now. <br />And where the Nail Salon is, it used to be this little Mom &amp; Pop candy and sandwich shop. I can&#039;t remember the name. And on the Southwest corner was a big deli. I can&#039;t remember the name of that one either. Now those big old white double doors facing the corner are all boarded up. <br />The Southeast corner had a Greek gift shop that also rented videos.<br /><br />On 31st St, past Ditmars, right past the el, on the West side of the street, there was a pet supply shop, I think the owner was Vinnie? He sold mostly pet food, but actually sold live animals sometimes. One time, I cringe to remember, he was selling a Vietnamese Pot Bellied Pig. (Adorable.) He threatened that the little pig would end up being someone&#039;s dinner if no one bought him. My partner at the time and I found someone to buy him but that is a story for another time.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;m jumping the gun a bit but as you can read elsewhere on this board or in yesterday&#039;s New York TImes the Presbyterian Church complex on 33rd Street between Broadway and 31st Avenue is a goner.&nbsp; The ubiquitous HANAC organization has bought the buildings and property from what&#039;s left of the congregation for $4 million.&nbsp; &nbsp;At least the HANAC building will be going for a good use -- senior housing.

				Hey Chris you and I could probably talk all day about old Astoria. That steakhouse on 21 St was the Ranch and the PC Richards was a King Kullen before and before that it was a bowling alley. Another reader said it was a farm which most of Queens used to be. The Key Food on 31 St and Ditmars was a Pizza Bowl when I was young. My old landlady used to tell me that what is La Guardia airport was once an amusement park with a huge ferris wheel. I am constantly researching old Astoria and got a ton of info from Forgotten.com

				When did the Egyptian or Arab places on Steinway near the Grand Central first open?&nbsp; I can no longer remember if they were there when I moved here 20 years ago.&nbsp; &nbsp;I didn&#039;t often venture beyond the movie theatre that was on the corner of 30th &amp; Steinway.<br /><br />I seem to remember there being a large German restaurant on the same side of Steinway as the movie theatre, maybe between 30th &amp; 28th Avenue or maybe between 28th Avenue &amp; Astoria Blvd.

				Another thing, much to my chagrin, that disappeared are Chinese hand laundries.&nbsp; When I first moved to Astoria I used to go one on the corner of 34th &amp; Broadway.&nbsp; The restaurant, Uncle George&#039;s or whatever it is called expanded its space and took over my Chinese hand laundry.&nbsp; &nbsp;They moved to the corner of 31st Street and whatever the street is that is just east of Steinway.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I liked the way they did my shirts so much I made the trek and continued to patronize them.&nbsp; &nbsp;I eventually got sick of the walk and started to use a Chinese hand laundry that was on Crescent just south of Broadway.<br /><br />Then I moved and used the people just east of Steinway, but they went out of business.<br /><br />I walked by Crescent Street one day and that guy was gone.<br /><br />The only other Chinese place was &quot;Al&#039;s&quot; on Broadway a block or two west of 21st Street.&nbsp; I remember going in there once to find out how long it would take and they told me there was a two-week turnaround on shirts.&nbsp; I never bothered to go there and the place never seemed to be open when I went buy there.&nbsp; &nbsp;It too is long gone.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been searching for a good Chinese hand laundry since.&nbsp; There doesn&#039;t appear to be any more of them in Astoria and from what I understand from people here long before my time, they used to be all over the place.

				I received a little bit of Astoria history last night.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve always wondered why there are two first-class fruit stands on 30th Avenue between 32nd &amp; 33rd Streets.&nbsp; I think there is only one or two sores in between.&nbsp; <br /><br />I asked the guy in the fruit stand that is not on the corner about this and he told me they opened in 1978.&nbsp; &nbsp;He said the other fruit stand, the one on the corner, had been located across the street where Key Food now is and bought the building and moved to the corner of 30th &amp; 33rd. He said that occurred in 1982, well before my time in Astoria.&nbsp; &nbsp;From reading this board the space on the corner of 33rd St. &amp; 30th Ave. had been a bar.

				I went out for my jog on Saturday and decided to vary the route home to break up the routine and took a run down I think it is 23rd Street or whatever the street is two blocks east of 21st Street.&nbsp; &nbsp;I hadn&#039;t been on that block in a while and there is an old deli -- called the Parkside Deli even though it isn&#039;t even near the Park -- midblock on 23rd between Hoyt &amp; Newtown Avenues.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think it was closed when it first appeared on my radarscope and then was open for a while and now it appears to be closed, though you can still see some of the wares in the window.&nbsp; &nbsp;That is kind of an obscure block and I always thought it was an odd spot for a convenience store/deli.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is midblock and not on the corner or anything.<br /><br />And on the southwestern corner of Newtown &amp; 23rd there was one of those once ubiquitous auto repair places that appears to be closed and a &quot;for sale&quot; sign has gone up.&nbsp; &nbsp;It looks like that will be the next apartment building.&nbsp; &nbsp;Right across the street, where there was a flea market/second hand shop/used furniture store -- is a new apartment building.&nbsp; &nbsp;In fact there are several new residential buildings/buildings under construction between 21st and 31st Streets on Newtown.

				I don&#039;t get on Steinway between 28th &amp; Astoria Blvd. much, but had to make an emergency stop at Citibank to replenish my wallet and I noticed another bit of Astoria history is gone, gone, gone.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Carvel Store, a free-standing building that as far as I know has been there since I moved to Astoria in &#039;87, is now but a memory.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t think I ever went in there, but it was kind of an odd building in that it wasn&#039;t attached to the other storefronts.&nbsp; &nbsp;It was just always there.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is now longer.

				Chris, the Carvel store was there as far back as the 1960s. Because of the franchising of Carvel and the other competions, it had alot less business in recent year. I think it was closed the last 2-3 years.<br /><br />I remember Don&#039;s Restaurant too, it was a nice place to eat.

				King Cullen actually lasted there into, I believe, the early 90s.&nbsp; I remember going there as a kid as well.&nbsp; I think sometime around 1993 or 1994 it closed, and a year or so later, PC Richard moved in.&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty sure it wasn&#039;t before 1995 when the PC Richard opened up, however, I seem to clearly remember it at the Broadway location at least until 1994.

The site where PC Richard is now, and the surrounding 6–8 block area was once the Borden Milk Farm. The cows roamed the fields until milking time. I remember as a little girl when the farm was sold and the developers divided the property. Borden held a HUGE party for Astorians. They gave out gifts and horse rides. They served &#039;soda pop&#039; and goodies to all the kids and their parents. We all got our pictures taken with (I believe her name was) Elsie The Cow.<br /><br />One of my most memorable things was that Borden sold most of their heavy cream to the Willner Family who owned the shop next door to what is now Frank&#039;s Bakery on the corner of 30th Avenue and 36th Street—it used to be a Kosher deli—and the Willner&#039;s churned the cream into butter. They also sold fresh eggs. Right from the chickens. They were graded by weight. Mama used to send me up to Willner&#039;s for fresh churned butter to be put into Mama&#039;s crystal butter dish, and the eggs were put into a wire basket which I had to bring from home. Although the Willner family were Orthodox Jewish folks, they sold cracked eggs at Easter time for a penny apiece so that they could be colored for Easter baskets.<br /><br />

				On Steinway Street between Broadway and 31 ave, there was a restaurant called Dom&#039;s.

				Need some help. A couple of places have been driving me crazy lately...<br /><br />On Broadway and 36th Street, before it was the Eckerd/Genovese, before it was the PC Richard, before it was the TSS, it was something else (going back 30+ years). I remember being really young -- barely school aged -- when the place closed and I remember going with my family to the &quot;going out of business&quot; sale. What was it? I vaguely recall getting shoes or clothing or something like that, but I could be wrong.<br /><br />Also, on 30th Avenue, up by Rudy&#039;s (back when Rudy&#039;s was a real soda shop) there was a store that sold pretty much everything. We referred to it as just &quot;variety&quot; so that actually could have been its name or just more of a description of what they sold. I think they made keys too. I remember the owners -- an older guy and his wife, I think.<br /><br />I grew up here (in the apartment I still live in) and my mom grew up here (in the bldg I live in -- her family owned it) -- our family goes back to the late 40s in Astoria. Sadly, my mom is gone now and I would love to someday be able to tell MY children (which I don&#039;t have yet, but will eventually) about old Astoria, except I don&#039;t trust my memory without confirmation from others.

He made the best egg creams and had pinball machines in the back. I would stop by every day on my way home from school (at PS 17). Also, where the vegetable stand is on the corner of 33rd Street, that was a pizza place, right? I vaguely remember the owners -- a very nice Greek couple, IIRC. This is going back maybe 25+ years or so ago. <br /><br />I also remember when Grand Avenue Pizzeria was across the street from its current location, where the now-defunct Table 30 was. They had a room in the back -- I had my 11th birthday party there. There&#039;s a guy (who seems mentally ill/disabled) who is often seen handing out advertisements near the 30th Avenue subway station -- did he work in the pizza place many years ago or am I mixing him up with someone else?

				hello, I grew up in astoria in the 60&#039;s and have lived on the west coast since 73&#039;. After reading your posts I have a couple of nastalgic questions for you guys. Is there still a bowling alley on 31st street real close to the ditmars station? how about the loews theatre also on 31st st. also I was wondering if anybody knew about the R.E.A express terminal. not sure where it was I think near steinway,but my grandfather worked there and died there(heart attack at work)and I never really knew much about where he worked. If anybody has anykind of history about the place that would be great. If anybody lived around ditmars in the 60&#039;s or early 70&#039;s I would love to hear from you.&nbsp;

				<span class="bbc_u">REA</span> (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railway_Express_Agency) = Railroad Express Agency<br /><br />REA was sold to five of its officers and renamed REA Express in 1969, after several years of deficits. By then its entire business constituted less than 10% of all intercity parcel traffic and only 10% of its business moved by rail.<br /><br />REA sued the railroads and the United Parcel Service (UPS) for various reasons and became involved in suits and countersuits with the clerks&#039; union, and the Civil Aeronautics Board terminated REA&#039;s exclusive agreement with the airlines for air express. REA Express terminated operations in November 1975 and began liquidation. This was complicated by trials of some of its officers for fraud and embezzlement.<br /><br />The company filed for bankruptcy in 1975.

				Regarding the Railway Express Agency building... <br /><br />I wish my father was still alive - he probably knew your grandfather.&nbsp; My father worked there for 40 years, from the 30&#039;s thru the 70&#039;s.&nbsp; After working some of the NYC Subway construction, my father landed a job as a short-order cook at a diner on Northern Boulevard where the Expressmen would stop for coffee.&nbsp; They tipped him off to the job at the Express office and that was it. <br /><br />The Railway Express building was located on the east side of the Harold Avenue (39th Street) Viaduct, between Northern Boulevard and Skillman Avenue.&nbsp; It was built in the 1920&#039;s, and was where REA employees would report for work.&nbsp; There was a locker room, small cafeteria, pick-up window and payroll office, I believe.&nbsp; Amtrak acquired the building when it purchased the yard in 1976.&nbsp; <br /><br />The building led down to the Sunnyside Yards and a series of loading docks by the tracks where freight was moved onto and off of the trains and the trucks were also loaded and unloaded there.&nbsp; There was, and still is, a side road ramp leading down to the Yard further along the bridge.&nbsp; &nbsp;The terminal was known as Railway Express Agency Package Express Operations or PXT.&nbsp; (Which I&#039;m guessing stood for Package Express Terminal.)&nbsp; During its heyday, the facility was the largest of its type in the United States. <br /><br />The workers there were covered under the Brotherhood of Railway Clerks and the pensions were covered under the US Government Railroad Act.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t an easy job working the yards, as all the work was heavy and done outdoors in the extreme heat of summer and bitter cold of winter.&nbsp; The employees were only allowed inside for short periods - a bathroom break or a cigarette.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure when exactly when the building was demolished - I would guess about four or five years ago.

				Yes, but who ever listened to our parents back then?&nbsp; Well, certainly not me, anyways.&nbsp; My memories of the Boulevard back then were of just total demolition and razed buildings, although I do remember the old post office buildings and the Ronzoni Factory.&nbsp; What an attraction for kids!&nbsp; I think Revlon, or some perfume manufacturer had a factory back then, because when we checked into it, we all got so sick of the smell, we ran all the way back home - and smelled it for days afterwards.&nbsp; Back then, the only security was the fence you couldn&#039;t climb...<br /><br />Recently I found out that Madison Square Garden had built a wooden open air arena on 46th and Northern where the big car dealership is, and actually had some championship boxing matches there!&nbsp; It was called the Madison Square Garden Bowl and could seat 72,000!&nbsp; It stretched from 46th to 48th Street.&nbsp; It was built in 1932, which is way before my time...<br /><br />The only other thing I remember on that stretch back then was the massive SAFE WAY gas station, which was the biggest gas station I&#039;ve ever seen.&nbsp; It was on the corner of 39th and Northern, where the HESS station is now, but I think it was bigger back then.&nbsp; Like everything else was, I guess...<br /><br />Coming back to the Railway Express, when my Dad worked the 4-12 shift, often I&#039;d wait up for him to do the Daily News crossword with him and get a piece of - now does anyone remember this? - Adams BLACKJACK licorice gum!&nbsp; I think they had a factory up on Queens Boulevard and did Chicklets, too!&nbsp; LOL!&nbsp; :)

				A few observations from my recent peregrinations in and about Astoria.&nbsp; &nbsp;I noticed that Raleigh, the men&#039;s store on Broadway between 32nd and 33rd, is no more.&nbsp; &nbsp;That was there when I moved to Astoria in &#039;87 and lived literally around the corner on 32nd.&nbsp; &nbsp;While I never shopped there, it was sad to see that establishment gone.&nbsp; &nbsp;Those of us who have lived in Astoria for awhile may remember the other, similar men&#039;s store on Broadway between 31st and 32nd that went out of business a number of years ago -- probably the late 1990s.&nbsp; They combined operations with Raleigh.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />And it looks like that Italian restaurant/pizza place that was open on 35th Avenue directly across the street from the Museum of the Moving Image is no more.&nbsp; &nbsp;I never went in there, but it looked like a nice place.&nbsp; It didn&#039;t last all that long.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is kind of surprising that it wasn&#039;t able to make it because that area has undergone such a renaissance since the Astoria movie &#039;plex opened.&nbsp; &nbsp; And there was a little Carvel store across from the multiplex that is also no longer there.&nbsp; &nbsp;I always wondered about that place because there are these thick trees right in front of the building and I wondered how people would even know it was there.<br /><br />And I was walking down 36th Avenue a couple of weeks ago -- New Year&#039;s Eve now that I think about it -- I noticed that the corner of 36th Ave. and either 33rd or 34th street is now a hole in the ground.&nbsp; &nbsp;I can&#039;t even remember what was there and assume an apartment building is going to go up.&nbsp; &nbsp;What recession?<br /><br />And I noticed on Queensboro Plaza that that hideous parking garage is just about completely demolished.&nbsp; &nbsp;That is indeed addition by subtraction.&nbsp; &nbsp;And there is another now vacant lot on the south side of the plaza, or just off the south side of the plaza, next to the entrance to the trains.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is right behind where the bar used to be (now a deli).&nbsp; &nbsp;Who knows what is going up.<br /><br />And finally I noticed some more skeletons of new buildings going up around the 39th Street subway stop.&nbsp; Hard to believe that anyone can get real estate financing in this economic climate, but the real estate rules for the rest of the country never seem to apply to New York City.

				Anyone remember Records Spectacular on Steinway between 31st and 30th Avenues.Music store with a a small head shop area.The rumor was if you asked for chocolate chip cookies,you would actually get a nickel bag.I was too young to find out.<br /><br />It later became a dress shop.I believe it was called Fran&#039;s Dress Shop.They had a going out of business sale for something like 8 years.

				I wish I had found this interesting thread to post in rather than starting a new one with my memories of living in Astoria.&nbsp; http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=15241.0<br /><br />I read through these posts from start to finish and enjoyed the memories some of them brought back. The Grand and the Ditmars Theaters and even a mention of the bowling alley below the Ditmars station being gone, did anything take it&#039;s place down in the basement? <br /><br />Jacobi&#039;s and Melhop&#039;s, I guess no one hung out at Ringen&#039;s the soda shop on the West side of 31st St halfway between Ditmars and 23rd Ave. How about Phil&#039;s tiny Kosher deli also on the West side of 31st St. a few stores North of 23rd Ave. He served great hot dogs with cole slaw, the only way I thought a hot dog was served when I was a little kid. Bickford&#039;s cafeteria on 31st St. almost next to the Grand, another Astoria lunch spot for shoppers. <br /><br />Great memories to think back on from the 40&#039;s and 50&#039;s.

				http://www.facebook.com/n/?reqs.php&amp;mid=ab4239G425bf493G3422b0G2<br /><br />I remember this pool hall, and I also remember my father telling me he played pool &quot;down at the Ditmars station&quot; This would have been back in the 1950&#039;s. When I was there, in the 1980&#039;s it was run down, very old looking, even had an old looking clock set in the counter to punch the time you started playing. So I would guess that the gentleman that is remembering this place as a bowling alley is remembering it before the 1950&#039;s. Stores always change. Iam sure it is the same place. On another note, how things change, My Grandmother told me about after a night of drinking,they would all go eat chinese food at 4 in the morning at a restaurant that was in the Steinway movie theatre building. (IE learners, 31st and steinway.) lol even during the great depression there was an active night life in Astoria.

				Mr. Astoria For Life. If you referred to my post about the pool hall and bowling alley they were two separate places on opposite sides of 31st St at the Ditmars station in the early 50&#039;s. The pool room was on the West side upstairs and was a real dump with dirty windows and a bunch of us wanna-be juvenile delinquents with DA haircuts smoking Luckies and shooting pool .<br /><br />The bowling alley wasn&#039;t exactly Mayberry either it was down one level below ground on the East side of the station if you kept going down from the station through the office building. I set pins there sometimes to make a few dimes before I went to my regular 5PM delivery boy job in Manhattan. 10 cents a line so if you set for two lanes with two bowlers each you made 40 cents for each game and you might score a big dime tip for a big half a buck total for your half hour&#039;s time. Lou the owner would not let kids set pins for any big money games so you could not mess up a payday for one of the few hustlers who made a living there. I saw guys lose five or six hundred dollars over the course of an afternoon to Albie the Phantom who looked like a bum but bowled like a pro. ...the good times.

				Looks like the Zabb Thai Restaurant on 30th Avenue between 34th and 35th Streets is closed.&nbsp; &nbsp;Whether permanent or temporary I don&#039;t know, but they renovated fairly recently.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />That block has changed since I moved into the neighborhood in &#039;01.&nbsp; &nbsp;In addition to Zabb Thai, Flemings one of those &quot;old men&#039;s bars&quot;, closed its doors recently.&nbsp; &nbsp;When I moved in in &#039;01 the corner store at 34th and 30th was a hardware store that was closing.&nbsp; &nbsp;A pretty good restaurant -- with a dynamite breakfast as well as good burgers -- opened in its place, but went out of business after a couple of years.&nbsp; &nbsp;They kept changing the format, at one time having belly dancers in a bar at the back of the restaurat.&nbsp; Another restaurant replaced it and seems to be doing very well.&nbsp; &nbsp;On the other end of the block at the corner of 35th and 30th Avenue was a candy store run by South Asians.&nbsp; Occasionally, I&#039;d buy my &quot;New York Times&quot; there when the paper boy failed to show up.&nbsp; &nbsp;That closed and a high end seafood restaurant, Akli, opened.&nbsp; &nbsp;Akli, for the record, is terrific based on the one time I ate there.&nbsp; There is also a tiny Indian sweets shop on the block that has closed and reopened at least once since I&#039;ve lived there.&nbsp; &nbsp;And there is another South Aisian-owned business, a printing shop, that also included a cell phone store at one point.&nbsp; &nbsp;The cell phone store moved to the northwest corner of 34th &amp; 30th Avenue.&nbsp; There is even a strange bank, called the Somali Exchange Bank, which I&#039;ve never been in.

				Does anyone here ever notice the old phone numbers still seen on some places of business? &quot;Old phone numbers&quot; means exchange-name formats, from before there were area codes and you picked up the phone and asked the operator for &quot;AStoria 4-5500 (http://sorabji.com/pictures/Telephone_Exchange_Names/IMG_5460-1024x768.jpg.html)&quot; or &quot;NIghtingale 9-3839 (http://sorabji.com/pictures/Telephone_Exchange_Names/DSC03694.JPG.html)&quot;. <br /><br />I started noticing these many years ago always thought they were cool, and a few months ago I started pointing them out to people. I was surprised to find that almost no one under the age of 50 knew what I was talking about, and that folks were looking right at these old numbers not knowing what they were. <br /><br />The most common exchanges seen in our area are AStoria, STillwell, and RAvenswood, but among other pre-occupations I am on the hunt for other exchange name sightings. A rather large one which I bet everyone here has seen while entering Queens via the 59th Street Bridge (upper level) is the Steinway Storage Warehouse (http://www.sorabji.com/pictures/Telephone_Exchange_Names/IMG_5617-1024x768.jpg.html), which has had its &quot;AStoria 8-9090&quot; phone number on display since 1926.<br /><br />I started a photo set of telephone exchange names (http://www.sorabji.com/pictures/Telephone_Exchange_Names/) sightings in Astoria and anywhere else, including old magazines and other old photos I have around. The real prizes, though, are the &quot;live&quot; ones, where companies in business since the 1920s or 1930s still display their old exchange name phone number on their signage. <br /><br />Has anyone here seen other exchange names around AStoria? Here&#039;s the set (http://www.sorabji.com/pictures/Telephone_Exchange_Names/).<br /><br />

				That is kind of cool, like the yellow &quot;fallout shelter signs&quot; that remain or when they knock down a building and reveal the facade of a neighboring building that has an old ad painted on it for some store or brand that is long gone.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I moved to my current block in Astoria in &#039;01 and there are four small stores on the corner of 34th Street and 30th Avenues.&nbsp; &nbsp;They have all changed since I moved to my current located in March of &#039;01.&nbsp; So it hasn&#039;t been quite nine years.&nbsp; &nbsp;The first store, closest to 30th Avenue, was a cell phone store that looked to be on its last legs when I moved it.&nbsp; &nbsp;It was the first of the four to close. It then became a sari shop.&nbsp; That closed and it is now a travel agency that caters to South Asians.&nbsp; 3 businesses there.<br /><br />The second store, if memory serves me correctly, was an old barber shop that I actually patronized.&nbsp; &nbsp;The barber told me he had been there since the 1970s and it was quite the place.&nbsp; &nbsp;The barber was getting old and couldn&#039;t see well.&nbsp; &nbsp;I like to get my hair cut short and I&#039;d get home and have to shave off the spots he missed.&nbsp; &nbsp;There is now a different barber shop in the space, but I think he actually moved to the store next door and then relocated to the current spot.&nbsp; Two businesses (three if you count the barber shop) in this spot.<br /><br />The third store was a shoe repair place.&nbsp; It was the second business, after the cell phone store, to close.&nbsp; &nbsp;Then I think the barber shop moved it and he in turn moved next door to make way for one of those stores where you can go into a booth and make telephone calls.&nbsp; &nbsp;I noticed that the business hasn&#039;t been open recently so I don&#039;t know what its status is.<br /><br />The forth store was a beauty salon.&nbsp; &nbsp;Then it became a business that sold DVDs and CDs for Balkin countries (don&#039;t ask me which ones).&nbsp; I rarely saw anyone in there.&nbsp; &nbsp;It lasted about a year or so.&nbsp; &nbsp;Then an insurance agency moved in and it lasted about a year before closing in recent months.&nbsp; The site is currently vacant.

				I was walking by the Pinochio, the restaurant on the southeast corner of 32nd Street &amp; 30th Avenue and it was closed.&nbsp; &nbsp;A sign on the door said it is relocating to 30-45 30th Avenue I believe.&nbsp; It had been located on the opposite corner for as long as I can remember until that new building went up.&nbsp; It moved to the other side of 32nd Street in the late 90s/early 2000&#039;s.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think it was already at its current site when I moved to this part of Astoria in &#039;01.&nbsp; In any event, more changes.&nbsp; <br /><br />Speaking of changes, I noticed there are quite a few &quot;for rent&quot; signs on 30th Avenue, on the blocks west of Steinway.&nbsp; &nbsp;Three bars have bit the dust: Flemings, the Oaks and Revelry.&nbsp; And I noticed at least four &quot;for rent&quot; signs on apartment buildings.&nbsp; I think two were on 35th St. between 28th Avenue and Astoria Blvd. and two were on the same street between 28th Avenue and 30th Avenue.&nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe the bad economy is finally having an impact in Astoria.

I remember the place quite well because my father was a regular there. In fact, I met the gentleman in question many times. His name was Jimmy Young, and he was actually Whitey Ford&#039;s step-father. I remember him being a very tall and broad man - he looked HUGE to me at the time, but I guess the fact that I was just a child had a lot to do with it. Other than that, what I recall most about him was that he was a very nice man with a very sweet and quiet demeanor. Many times when my father had to watch me because my mother had to do something away from home, my father would take me with him to the Ivy Room. I would get my choice of either a Coke, a Seven-Up, or a Shirley Temple (which was really just a Seven-Up with a little grenadine and a couple of maraschino cherries added). I then had to sit on one of the sofas off to the side and be quiet. It seemed like most of the time, the Yankee game was on the TV. Mainly, I found having to sit on a sofa in the bar while my father talked with his friends extremely boring. Even to this day, I find bars boring, and could never understand the appeal they have for so many people.<br /><br />One other thing I remember about Jimmy Young took place when I was still in kindergarten. We had to bring empty eggshells in to school which we then painted to make Easter eggs. I had about two or three of them. That day, my father picked me up from school and we stopped off at the Ivy Room for a few minutes on the way home. I gave Jimmy one of my Easter eggs which he stood in a shot glass and placed it on one of the glass shelves that ran along the wall behind the bar. It stayed there from then on until the Ivy Room finally closed about nine years later, which would have been around 1972 or 1973.

				The ivy room was still open into the 80&#039;s because I remember it and wasn&#039;t born until &#039;77. Maybe some new owners took it over at some point, but it was definitely still called the Ivy Room until much later than the years you indicate.

Jack Rogers, the original owner and manager, did sell the business and move to Florida sometime around &#039;72 or &#039;73, though. The Ivy Room was then run by a succession of new managers, none of which lasted any more than two or three years. The former regular crowd soon moved on, and the place got seedier and seedier as it successively changed hands. Sometime in the eighties, the bar was bought by someone who changed the name, although I can&#039;t recall what it was. I moved away from that area to where I am now in 1995, and have passed by the bar only a few times since. Last time I looked, a few years ago, there was still a bar at that location. Whether the location is still a bar or not, I have no idea.<br />

				I found this thread to be absolutely amazing.&nbsp; I was born in Astoria in 1958 and still live here.&nbsp; I would love to comment on lots of the posts mentioned because I remember many of the old stores from 23rd Avenue, Ditmars and 31st Street.<br />There is one immediate question I would like to ask that has been a topic of discussion lately.&nbsp; Lisa&#039;s Pizza World, that was on the corner of 23rd Avenue and 31st Street during the late 70&#039;s and is now a Greek Restaurant.&nbsp; What was in the place before it was Lisa&#039;s Pizza World?&nbsp; I received a response from a gentleman on another thread who remembered it as a radio place during the 1940&#039;s and 50&#039;s, but I know it was not a radio store in the 70&#039;s.&nbsp; <br />Anyone remember?<br />Thank you. <br />Life Long Resident

				Most of the entrances (within) the houses have been sealed up years ago by the previous owners. Most new owners of the homes have no clue they exist.&nbsp; I was told that this was done bec. the tunnels allowed easy access to all the homes via the underground and that robberies where high, nevermind the rats.<br />If you speak to the old time residents of that area they will tell you that the tunnels do exist.&nbsp; I would imagine that the original network of tunnels no longer exist, but the ones that do would lead to dead ends - due to all the construction/tear-downs of the grand homes that once belonged to Old Astoria Village. <br />&nbsp;

				The so called &quot;tunnel&quot; that everyone is talking about was what we use to call the &quot;a**hole&quot;. It used to dump raw sewerage into the east river untill they closed it off. There were two huge concrete doors that opened with chains at high tide and raw waste would flow out into the east river. That is why there used to be a god awful smell at low tide in that area. I lived across the street from the tennis courst from 1961 til I got married in 1992. They also closed off Shore Blvd. some time in the early 80&#039;s to vehicular traffic and the area was so much nicer. Only foot and bike traffic sere allowed on shore Blvd. The area was so much quiter in the summer time.

				While it is true that there were tunnels and hidden undergorund rooms under the large mansion style houses on 12th and 14th streets the tunnel that exited at the east river at the south end of Shore Blvd was a household sewer outlet. When I was a kid we used to watch the many female sanitary items floating out into the river when the flow dorrs were opened. Believe it or not. Also the rumor was that they were part of the undergorund railroad not slave traders.

				I grew up in yorkville on East 72nd st . My dad worked for REA for 33 years until his 60th birthday.He worked there until 1975 or 1976 until he was able to start collecting his pension. When I was a young boy I remember getting the Steinway Bus on 59th street in Manhattan and get off at Northern Blvd and Steinway. We then would walk up over the small bridge to the terminal by the railroad tracks. I remember walking on the platforms and riding on the fork lift with my dad. He loaded and unloaded freight from trucks onto and off of the railroad cars. I carry my dad&#039;s REA ID to this day. He died from a heart attack in 1980 only a few years after he retired. I would sometimes drive down to the abondoned terminal to relive my memories of him at work. He helped me buy my first car at the Ford Dealership next door.

				I was doing some research last night on the old QP&#039;s Marketplace&#039; down at Queens Plaza. A NY Times article about it referred to it originally being called &#039;QP&#039;s Boxcar Marketplace&#039;, and stated there would be a few merchants selling stuff directly from box cars opened up into the building from the tracks out back. I&#039;m not sure if I&#039;m remembering this right, but I very vaguely recall one shop in there that was nothing more than a guy with a register at a back door of the building with a boxcar full of goods open for customers to by from. Maybe this was just my overactive imagination?<br /><br />Does anyone else remember this, or have some good QP marketplace stories?&nbsp; I&#039;m writing up a story about the place and would love to hear anything you&#039;ve got on it.<br /><br />My parents would take me there to buy comic books.&nbsp; If I recall right there were two comic shops, and the owners of one of them eventually moved to a storefront in sunnyside gardens after the rent was jacked up. <br />

				Wow, nice pictures! Amazing how clean and uncongested the streets were! In the first picture there&#039;s a laundromat next to the post office. What business was next to that laundromat? I might be imagining this, but wasn&#039;t there a Chinese restaurant there? Ha Ha! The guy crossing the street in the second photo is wearing &quot;marshmallows&quot;. Any old timer dudes out there remember the chunky shoes with white rubber soles? I remember buying match box cars at Kiddieland. They had them displayed at the register in a glass case. Today skin tight jeans are all the rage, but back then you could buy the them at Weber&#039;s (4th picture). I&#039;d buy the craziest colors like mint green or orange made by Wrangler&#039;s. The only memory I have of a pair of Sevastakis shoes (last picture) that I purchased in the late 70&#039;s was that the sole of one shoe cracked in half. Utter garbage!<br /><br /><br />Thanks for the memories PJ!

				The record store you might be referring to&nbsp; was Records Spectacular.<br />I mentioned way,way back in this thread that I remembered the rumors that if you asked for chocolate chip cookies it was actually code for something smokable.I was too young at the time to know if it was true.

				I was born and raised in Astoria and moved in 1986. I just found this site and am thrilled. There is little about Astoria, from that period, almost 30 years that I don&#039;t recall. I just wanted to express sadness re: Lanterna&#039;s closure. I loved this place and went back when I graduated with my Masters Degree in 1995. I also grew up on 34th and 30th avenue. :smiley:

				I recall PS6 on Steinway. I believe they tore it down around 1970.<br /><br />The PS 5 on 29th Street burned down in the late 1960s, maybe 1968. I heard it was started by a student playing matches in a cloak room.

				Clarification: In a prior post I mentioned wearing a Phil&#039;s t-shirt in LA in &#039;82 and in a subsequent post talk about how my family has been in their apt at 32nd &amp; Bway for 70 years.&nbsp; This is actually correct.&nbsp; I did not attend Palms Jr. High; I was already an adult living in that neighborhood and played hoops on their outdoor courts.&nbsp; <br /><br />My grandparents had a general goods store and lived above it on Bway between 33rd and 34th until the end of WW2, then moved to 32nd.&nbsp; My mom was a teenager at the time; she went to PS5, I believe, then 166, and eventually Bryant.&nbsp; (I&#039;m not sure whether 126 may have been in that sequence as well?)&nbsp; When she married she moved to Astoria Blvd and 14th and when my dad disappeared moved back in with her parents in 1960 and has lived there ever since.&nbsp; I&#039;ve lived just about everywhere in the US but resurface in Astoria every few years, and I am sitting in what used to be my grandparents&#039; bedroom right now.<br />At 4:30am there is a car playing hip-hop at maximum volume (with an obviously augmented stereo designed just for this purpose) right under my window.&nbsp; For the past half hour or so, every few minutes they turn it up, blast away until they can be sure everyone in this building has been awakened, then turn it down again before people can call in the noise compliant to the police.&nbsp; A few minutes later, they do it again.&nbsp; Rinse and repeat.&nbsp; The best part of it is that this pattern of behavior makes it clear they are not just sitting in the car listening to loud music as they gobble souvlaki, but rather deliberately doing this for the primary purpose of annoying the neighbors.&nbsp; I can&#039;t see them from this vantage but I bet they&#039;re having a great laugh...<br />And actually I&#039;m having a good laugh at it too as I&#039;m always up and around all night so personally it&#039;s not really bothering me but I bet everyone else in this building is tearing their hair out!&nbsp; &nbsp;:laugh:

				I completely remember Norwood Lanes.&nbsp; I used to live across the street above Terizzi&#039;s Bakery.&nbsp; It was a small bowling alley with maybe 10-12 lanes.&nbsp; I learned how to bowl there during the 70&#039;s.&nbsp; The owner had a son that was really good - probably 185 average as a teenager.
