				I had dinner there the other night and it was absolutely fantastic.<br />I haven&#039;t had such a great dinner since the last time I ate at the Grand Hotel in France on the Riviera.<br />I couldn&#039;t believe how good was the dessert too!!!!! The Crepe with lemony creme patissiere inside and the crannberries and citrus fruits!!!<br />Highly recommends! :lol: :-D :-P

				Definitely a nice new restaurant (taking over a former restaurant space) just to the east of Steinway and 30th Avenue.&nbsp; The food is tasty, the staff is very friendly and it is owned by Astoria locals.&nbsp; I, and others, have posted some reviews over at Yelp:<br />http://www.yelp.com/biz/bistro-boite-a-cafe-astoria#hrid:gkUCvU9y3Q6BeAQlVf7j7A/query:boite%20a%20cafe<br /><br />It isn&#039;t that crowded in there yet, but it should be.<br /><br />Matt<br /><br />Here&#039;s to a world full of listening and understanding.<br /><br />

				I don&#039;t mean to judge a book by its cover, but drove by here on Friday night around 7 planning on eating dinner, and it was empty, which is fine, but the thing that turned us off was the flourescent blue lights in the place. It seemed more like a club than a restaurant, not a place for a nice quiet meal. which is totally fine, but i was just under the impression from postings that it was more of a food centric place than a sceney place. <br />Anyways, I dont&#039; mean to bash the place because i&#039;ve never eaten there. Anyone else turned by the decor?<br />

				I agree that the florescent blue decor is a quite a bit strange for a French bistro. They didn&#039;t renovate the decor from the last restaurant that was in there.<br /><br />It is not nightclub-like at all, though, so don&#039;t worry about that.&nbsp; There was pleasant low-volume jazz playing in the background this Saturday night.<br /><br />

				Have now had 2 fantastic breakfasts there (food, service and non-thumping music) and am looking forward to dinner. Food value to price is great for this neighborhood. The owner is really gracious and wants to please.

				Is this place still good?&nbsp; Every month I think, &quot;I have to try that place,&quot; but when I get there and see it&#039;s all blue and has TV sets going and it&#039;s too dark to read, I remember why I haven&#039;t eaten there.
