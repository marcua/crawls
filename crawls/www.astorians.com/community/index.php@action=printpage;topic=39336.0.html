				I am a high school student currently doing a project on customer satisfaction with the restaurant grading policy and how often customers pay attention to the restaurant grades outside. I would like to know how often you pay attention to the Letter Grade located outside of the restaurant and how it affects your decision in going into a new resturant. <br /><br /><br />I would greatly appreciate it if you could take my survey and contribute to my data (Optional).<br />https://docs.google.com/forms/d/19jkUuq_75KY6nRLU2yrONFLu4tgfgZoE4k8NzXa3blo/viewform (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/19jkUuq_75KY6nRLU2yrONFLu4tgfgZoE4k8NzXa3blo/viewform)<br /><br /><br />

				Hi Anthony,<br /><br /><br />I completed your survey yesterday - just wanted you to know. <br /><br /><br />I won&#039;t eat in a restaurant with anything less than an A rating. My father was a chef and I used to go to work<br />with him and sit in the kitchen at the restaurants where he worked. I saw a lot! But my dad impressed a lot<br />of things upon me and I&#039;m pretty picky when it comes certain things! <br /><br /><br />Good luck w/your project.

				I took the survey as well, Anthony.&nbsp; My understanding is that an &quot;A&quot; for restaurant grading is nothing like an &quot;A&quot; that you get on a paper, or for a final grade in your class.&nbsp; A school &quot;A&quot; means outstanding or 90% wheras an &quot;A&quot; in restaurants means that the place is passable.&nbsp; &nbsp;There could be multiple health violations, but not enough to knock down the score to a B

				I personally don&#039;t care. I see the grading system as a way to extort money from restaurateurs. If a place was truly unsafe, they would close it.
