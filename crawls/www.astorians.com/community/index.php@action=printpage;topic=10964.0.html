				I am looking for a notary who can notarize some papers for me that works past 4-5PM. I don&#039;t know much about how these things work, but when I first showed up to get a document notarized I was told I had to bring a witness. I wasn&#039;t aware of that. Anyway, my witnesses are only available after 4-5PM and most offices with notary services are closed by then. If you can recommend anyone in walking distance of Broadway &amp; 32nd it would be greatly appreciated.

				I&#039;m pretty sure if you Google &quot;Notary&quot; and &quot;Astoria&quot; something will pop up.&nbsp; I did something like this awhile back for a friend who needed one in Manhattan but don&#039;t remember which website I went to.<br /><br />Hope this helps!

				I don&#039;t know anything specifically in the Broadway area, but there is a notary on 35th St. just off of Ditmars (behind Crown Chemists) who is open until at least 6:00.&nbsp; There is also a notary <em>in</em> Crown Chemists, but I don&#039;t know the notary hours.&nbsp; Here (http://sites.cornerdrugstore.com/store/consumerHome.aspx?CorpID=0x002000000000236A&amp;StoreID=0x0020000000000220) is their website with their store hours (most nights until 8pm) - you can call them and ask what hours the notary is there.<br /><br />33-20 Ditmars Blvd.<br />Tel: 718-278-6777

				Does your document/instrument require a subscribing witness?&nbsp; <br /><br />If not, you should not need a witness.

				sorry to get to this post a few days after it was started, but just in case someone else comes looking: try the banks. my girlfriend needed a document notarized, and we went to the commerce bank on 31st and ditmars (im not a commerce bank member) just after 5 pm, and they had someone on staff to notarize. and they were nice enough not to charge for it.<br /><br />don&#039;t forget - the maximum notaries are allowed to charge by law is $2. if you pay more, you&#039;re getting ripped off.

				I live in the Ditmars area and I was surprised to find that there is a notary at the local liquor store on 31st Street -- next to Citibank, I think -- and they&#039;re open til around 10:00 p.m. so maybe some liquor stores in your area have notaries.

				There is a gentleman at the mailbox store at 34-23 Steinway, he is a notary, and very professional. He is often around until 6:30 or even 7PM.<br />You need is acceptable identification. The store may be reached at 7187529009.

If they come to you, such as a mobile all-hours-notary, they pretty much charge what they want. After you are taking their time. And paying for it. It can cost up to $50.
