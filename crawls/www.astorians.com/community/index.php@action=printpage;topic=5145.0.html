Call 212-416-8000</strong></span><br /><br />According to the NY Attorney General&#39;s office, they&#39;ve never heard any complaints about IDT Energy. Bryan writes:<br /><br /><strong>&quot;</strong>This happened to me last week. 2 people came to my door from IDT, impersonating ConEd. <br /><br />I called the Attorney General&#39;s office at 212-416-8000 and they said this was the first they had heard of it. They need more complaints about IDT in order to start an investigation.<strong>&quot;</strong><br /><br />If IDT Energy attempted to slam you or someone you know, be sure to call and register the complaint. Obviously, not enough people. Then again, Mario Cuomo&#39;s team is in there now. Maybe Elliot Spitzer&#39;s team didn&#39;t just leave good notes.<br />&nbsp;— BEN POPKIN (http://consumerist.com/consumer/coned/idt-energy-at-your-door-call-2124168000-235541.php)<br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 16pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>F E B&nbsp; 8,&nbsp; 2 0 0 7</strong></span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 16pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>IDT Energy Continues To Con New Yorkers</strong></span><br /><br />Door to door marketers working for IDT Energy are still preying upon New Yorkers, pretending to work for ConEd in an effort to get residents to switch over electrical service to the energy reseller.<br /><br />Reader Patrick provides the latest dispatch, from the West Village, where the neighborhood was crawling today with IDT salespeople. In typical fashion, the IDT employees maintained that they worked for ConEd and tried to bully residents into showing their bills. According to his report, the IDT workers resisted residents demands that they leave and argued with the super. Patrick called the cops but by the time they arrived, the IDT salespeople had left.<br /><br />Attorney General Andrew Cuomo and the Public Utilities Commission need to deliver these guys a swift kick in the nuts, stat. Until then, residents beware. Patrick&#39;s letter, inside...<br /><br />If IDT has come to your door, impersonating ConEd, file a complaint with the NY Attorney General&#39;s office by calling 212-416-8000.<br /><br />Patrick writes:<br /><strong><br />&quot;</strong>Today a representative of IDT Energy came to my door (we do not allow canvassing in the building), presented herself as a Con Edison employee, (her EXACT words were &quot;I&#39;m with Con Ed&quot;), and tried to convince me that I was entitled to a &quot;reduction&quot; in my energy costs, and literally DEMANDED to see my bill. She kept repeating, completely ignoring my asking for her Con Ed badge, &quot;I NEED TO SEE YOUR BILL&quot;.<br /><br />After I insisted she was not with Con Ed, she said, well, &quot;I&#39;m with IDT&quot;, and I promptly asked her to leave the building. She refused, and continued to try and get me to sign over my energy commitment to IDT, pen in hand. After I threatened to call the police, I heard one of her colleagues talking to a tenant upstairs, realizing that there were four young women in the building, all very aggressive, perhaps not even knowing that they were slamming for an energy reseller...<br /><br />These girls clearly thought they were doing something above board and verbally fought for the right to remain in the building. I demanded again, and when three of the four blocked my access to go back upstairs I then called the police. The girls waited a bit, arguing with the super, and then left. When the police arrived I informed them of the issue.<br /><br />...Yet another issue of something which may be &quot;technically legal&quot; but which through means of lying and door to door intimidation, ends up hurting consumers and New Yorkers.<strong>&quot;</strong><br />— BEN POPKEN (http://consumerist.com/consumer/idt-energy/idt-energy-continues-to-con-new-yorkers-235223.php)<br /><br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Yeah.&nbsp; That came by my place a couple weeks ago.&nbsp; Asked to see my bill, and said I could save $.&nbsp; When I said I wasn&#039;t interested, one of them asked, &quot;But don&#039;t you want to save money?&quot;&nbsp; I just closed the door.&nbsp; There were two of them, neither could have been out of their teens, the younger looked about 15.

				wow!<br /><br />some IDT dude came to my apt. about a year ago.<br /><br />I was actually rushing to leave because I had to get to the airport to catch a flight, so I told him I didn&#039;t have time to deal with it right now. he seemed like a nice kid, but it seemed strange that they would go door to door asking for ConEd bills.<br /><br />I guess I&#039;m lucky that I really did have to go to the airport!

				I suggest that you get the contract that your mother signed and flip over the back and call the number there and let them know that someone whom is not authorized to sign over the right did so, and if there is still a problem call the DA&#039;s office.

				They were at my door 2 weeks ago. I told them I&#039;m not interested, that it&#039;s not the first time they rang my doorbell, and to stop it I will report them. They young goy was obviously just hired to to this as his job, and is getting alot of hostile responses for trying to earn a living. I&#039;m sure these people didn&#039;t know this is an ongoing nuisance for alot of energy consumers in Queens.

				There was a young girl with a clipboard at our townhouse the other day, speaking to both homeowners, as I left the blg.&nbsp; She immediately said a huge hello, and tried to chat me up to.&nbsp; With a suspicious eye I asked her if she was from IDT, and she said no, &quot;I&#039;m from Esco.&nbsp; Has IDT been here?&quot;&nbsp; I said &quot;I don&#039;t know, but they &#039;ve been coming around and annoying a lot of people.&quot;&nbsp; I still looked suspicious, so she turned back to my landlord and continued her spiel.&nbsp; I figured my landlord could handle himself, so I went on my way.<br /><br />Question - is Esco the same as IDT?&nbsp; What is Esco?&nbsp; This girl claimed that my landlord had not been responding to inquiries on his ConEd bill regarding their company.&nbsp; Do these people really have access to the bills?

				They&#039;re definitely on the prowl again.&nbsp; A young lady came to my door early this evening and got buzzed in (as I was expecting a UPS delivery today).&nbsp; When I confronted her, already up three flights, she began her sales pitch, and mumbled something about Con Ed, then mentioned IDT when pressed, then proceeded to try and invite herself into my apartment! I demanded to see her ID, asked why she had showed up unannounced, all the while forcing her out of the building by descending the stairs after her. In response to my demand to see ID, she told me she had &quot;forgotten to wear it today.&quot;&nbsp; (eye rolls all around)&nbsp; She kept trying to shove an IDT contract at me as proof of ID (perhaps confused).&nbsp; Fed up, I reiterated to her that legitimate companies do not show up unannounced, without means of ID, and less than politely told her never to show up at my building again.&nbsp; I am going to complain, as I recall the same people doing this a couple of years ago as well.

				I actually signed up for IDT.&nbsp; The people were in my building and I admit it can be offputting to have people knocking on your door who haven&#039;t been buzzed in.<br /><br />However, this IDT job is the livelihood for these people knocking on your door.&nbsp; &nbsp;They buy their groceries and pay the rent through this job.&nbsp; &nbsp;I didn&#039;t find any underhand tactics at all when they called on me.&nbsp; &nbsp;As best as I can recall they always identified themselves as representing IDT and promised me savings if I switched.&nbsp; &nbsp;While I haven&#039;t seen any discernable savings one way or another if I just remained with Con Ed (or let Con Ed choose my provider for me by default) I haven&#039;t been unhappy with IDT either.<br /><br />Just remember this job is the livelihood for some people.&nbsp;

				Is there any legitimacy to the claims that if we as customers don&#039;t select an ESCO Con Ed will do it for us as they are required to by law?<br /><br />I got some random call from a dude and Energy First or some such bull and that&#039;s what he claimed. Mind you he called for John. My name is on the bill, and his roommate&#039;s was on the bill at their old place. Same number but he has not been associated with Con Ed for quite some time.

				SO two guys dressed in bad suits came to our door and said they workd for IDT who is the supplier for Con ED.&nbsp; They asked to see our Con-Ed bill from last month and said they wanted to look in the messages section on the side of the bill.&nbsp; I had never heard of them and the whole thing sounded fishy so I asked them to leave and that I was not interested.&nbsp; They did not leave immediately and went on to explain how they were just trying to save me money., all they need was to see my con-ed bill.&nbsp; I told them I don&#039;t save them and that got them off my stoop.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve done some searching and from what I understand they are some sort of legit company that acts as an alternate supplier to con ed.&nbsp; That doesn&#039;t make much sense to me, but what did make sense was that people in NYC that have been duped to showing them their bill.&nbsp; These guys take your info and sign you up for their service anyway.&nbsp; And of course their service is 2x&#039;s the cost of Con-ED.&nbsp; <br /><br />So just an FYI, Beware Message that these guys seem to have moved into the &#039;hood.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if they&#039;ve been around before, but this was the first time I saw them on my street.&nbsp; Do Not Show them Your Bill.&nbsp; From some of the articles I&#039;ve read, in some &#039;hoods people have called the police and gotten them out.&nbsp; With all the elderly in this area it seem so wonder that there would be scammers like this around.

				When telemarketers call my home, I hang up the phone and don&#039;t give it a second thought. Sure, that&#039;s someone&#039;s &quot;livelihood&quot;, but they are unsolicited, disturbing my dinner, and I have no obligation to listen to them nor purchase what they&#039;re selling, nor show any interest in it. <br />How is this any different for IDT at my doorstep? They have come by 2-3 times already this year,&nbsp; always two high school age boys, clipboards in hand, asking me if I want to save on my Con Edison bill. When I say &quot;no thanks, bye&quot; they always have to get the last word in as I&#039;m closing the door, such as, &quot;Whatever, miss, I guess you don&#039;t like saving money.&quot;<br /><br /><br />

You can email escocomplaint@gmail.com or call 718-766-8828 with the following information: <br /><br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li> Name of the company</li><li>Name of the company they say they represent</li><li>Badge number or employee name</li><li>Date and time</li><li>Details of what they said/did</li></ul><br />Hopefully enough reports will come in to get this stopped!

				I just got a visit from two guys from Just Energy with the same basic spiel.&nbsp; (I&#039;m around the 30th Avenue area in the mid 30s.)&nbsp; I remembered having read something on this site about this type of thing and so took what the guys were saying with a grain of salt.&nbsp; They were talking really fast to the point where I was only picking up a general sense of what it was all about.&nbsp; I do believe they said they were with Con Ed even though their badges said Just Energy.&nbsp; I asked for some literature so I could review and think about it on my own time but they said no, the easiest way would be to look over my bill right there and sign up for service.&nbsp; Had to be today, apparently.&nbsp; I said no and they had pretty disapproving looks on their faces but again I said no, sorry, and closed the door.&nbsp; That&#039;s not how I make decisions.&nbsp; If they&#039;re legit then fine but that&#039;s not a great way to grow your business.&nbsp;

				2 guys were here in my bldg (34th/30th Ave) a few minutes ago knocking on doors. One tried his best...was mumbling something about my gas &amp; electric....I told him nicely and then not so nicely to scram and he was being very persistent. He finally went away...he&#039;s lucky my husband wasn&#039;t home. LOL!!

				They&#039;re baaaack!&nbsp; Today I admitted someone from this fly-by-night operation, but only into the vestibule.&nbsp; With no intercom, and expecting FedEx, I went downstairs to see who it was.&nbsp; I spotted the telltale clipboard, and said &quot;not interested!&quot; through the glass as this person tried in vain to get admitted through the second door.&nbsp; It was really gratifying to watch her squirm between the doors like a mouse in a glue trap.&nbsp; I really dislike this company.&nbsp; They&#039;re pushy, don&#039;t take no for an answer, prey on the elderly, etc.&nbsp; The key is not to let them into the building if it&#039;s a multiple dwelling.&nbsp; Last time they were in my building I had to back the guy down the stairs.&nbsp; They&#039;re disreputable and rude and I wish they&#039;d find another part of town to run in.&nbsp; &nbsp;:x

				These scammers have hit me at least 5 times just this month alone. They were just here a few minutes ago. I told him I was going to get my bill, pissed in a solo cup, opened the door and splashed it all over his face. I hope I don&#039;t get arrested.

				You really don&#039;t save any money and switching to another energy supplier.&nbsp; (ConEd still distributes the electricity).<br />Only good thing is these companies purchase energy from green sources, so when you get your electricity you are actually paying the supplier (IDT) for that service as well as ConEd for the distribution of it to your house.<br /><br />I have a different ESCO called US Gas and Electric.&nbsp; My energy comes from 100% renewable sources.&nbsp; Electric bill still comes from ConEd and its not that cheap (green energy costs more).<br /><br />IDT shouldn&#039;t make people sign and knock on doors that is pretty annoying and should stop.&nbsp; If anyone wants to switch ESCOs they can do it by calling ConEd.&nbsp; Also, they don&#039;t send out reps to sell services so if they say they are from ConEd they are lying.<br /><br />Excerpt from the ConEd website:<br />&quot;Some energy suppliers (ESCOs) have been using misleading tactics, such as saying that they represent Con Edison, or that customers must switch to a new supplier within 30 days. While we encourage our customers to shop around and explore alternative suppliers through PowerYourWay, Con Edison does not send salespeople to your door or have them call your home or business. There is no deadline, nor are customers required to choose a new supplier. Switching to a different supplier is your choice - so shop wisely and make the energy choice that makes sense for you.&quot;

				Just had a rep visit our house here in Flushing (when living in Astoria, don&#039;t think they ever thought to come around to our side entrance, where we rented!)<br />&nbsp;<br />Young woman, gave me the &quot;we&#039;ll save you money&quot; pitch, I just told her my husband and I already considered it and decided not to do it. Feel bad for these kids- must&#039;ve been lured in by the promise of sales experience or whatever. They must be desperate for work to do this.<br />&nbsp;<br />Believe it was from reading about them years ago on these boards that I was prepared!&nbsp; :cool: <br />&nbsp;<br />What sucks is that my gainfully-employed sis-in-law got suckered into selling something similar, through another company. She seems to have been coached much better, and has a slicker pitch: &quot;If you get on the computer, I can direct you to the website and show you how it works,&quot; something like that. <br />&nbsp;<br />But my husband/her brother had already gone through our ConEd bill with a fine tooth comb, comparing it to her company&#039;s pitch, and explained to her that it wouldn&#039;t be worth our while- about the same cost.

				Got a few more in the recent months. Somehow this time they sent a Chinese woman that really didn&#039;t know any English at all. Not sure where they figured out I was Chinese...<br /><br />She pretended to be my upstairs neighbor asking to compare bills.<br /><br />She got very aggressive, and the combination of a heavy accent in Mandarin and her extremely rapid talking got me lost.<br /><br />I told her to f___ off and she seemed really shocked, again saying that she was my upstairs neighbor. I expected her to back off and didn&#039;t realize she was still kind of halfway in the door when I slammed it shut. Damn near killed her.<br /><br />I go in and look out the window and see her leave the building, pull out a notebook, look around, and then walk away. Thank god. I was almost afraid she was actually my neighbor. Although, my neighbors did move out about a month afterwards... I&#039;m pretty sure it wasn&#039;t her??&nbsp; :huh:

				It&#039;s 2013, and time for New Tactics.&nbsp; Was stirred this afternoon from a nice nap by two male losers who knocked on multiple doors at once like they were PD. No More. The two clowns who I yelled to get the hell out, now! are gonna think this was pleasant treatment in the future. From now on I&#039;m headed their way with my Eddie Kranepool Little League Approved Louisville Slugger. Those that wanna get indignant with me and debate finer points of law are gonna hear it from me bellowed at them: without an expressed appointment with an individual you can name for me, You&#039;re Trespassing, and if you feel your civil liberties have been abridged I&#039;ll be the first to ring 911 on your behalf right after I&#039;ve re-arranged your dental work for you!

				Got a IDT pest knocking on our doors last month. Instead of pretending to be a ConEd employee, he tried to tell me he was there because I didn&#039;t receive some important information related to my bill from ConEd. Apparently he was there to save the day and make sure that I received the important information and that I should show him my bill so that he could clue me in. <br /><br />The jig was up as soon as he asked for my bill and couldn&#039;t coherently explain why I should show him this personal information. Grifter pitch? check. BS cost comparison chart? Check. Vague official looking badge? Check.&nbsp; The important notice he wanted to show me? That ConEd was required to allow people to sign up for ESCOs. I told him to get lost and made sure he exited the building. <br /><br />So, instead of BS&#039;ing about their employer they&#039;re now lying about important announcements that would impact your bill, all to push their shady reseller services. <br />

				Robo calls without prior written consent is a violation of the recently amended Telephone Consumer Protection Act. The FCC changed older consent rules to stop tele and SMS marketers from relying on a pre-existing business relationship to spam consumers. http://www.copilevitz-canter.com/resources/articles/get-it-in-writing-changes-to-the-fcc-express-consent-rules<br /><br />&quot;The new standard requires prior express written consent for predictive dialed and prerecorded advertising or solicitation calls or texts placed to wireless and residential numbers.&nbsp; Pursuant to the amended rule, written consent must include the consumer’s signature, and must show that the sender provided the consumer notice of the consequences of providing consent and the consumer’s telephone number. The signature may be obtained electronically or digitally.&quot;<br /><br />One more thing to add to the list of unethical (and nary illegal) business practices of these over-aggressive ESCO hucksters.

				I got visited by one of these folks today.&nbsp; I was working from home, and in the middle of a project, but had ordered food off seamless - so when there was a knock on the door, I thought it was my food.&nbsp; The lady there didn&#039;t have any food, and I asked &quot;How can I help you?&quot;&nbsp; She was very roundabout - I wasn&#039;t sure if she was with a church or a political candidate, but would not get to the point.&nbsp; I said, &quot;It&#039;s not a good time, I&#039;m in the middle of a project - can you just tell me what this is about?&quot;&nbsp; She then tried to make it sound urgent and that I needed to bring her my Con Ed bill immediately as I might be in trouble.&nbsp; I said, &quot;No.&quot; and closed the door.&nbsp; I don&#039;t like being rude, but she certainly came off as doing some sort of scam.&nbsp; If I hadn&#039;t read about this door-to-door switch your power company thing before, I might have gone looking for a bill (though I&#039;d like to think I&#039;m not that stupid).
