				Hey guys...<br /><br />I&#39;m coming up on my 4-year anniversary of using Verizon for my cell phone. After the past year or so, I&#39;ve been thinking about switching because a) their plans are pricey, and b) their standard &quot;free&quot; phone is a piece of crap, and the second one I&#39;ve had in a year has just broken (right after I purchased a brand new battery because the original battery only held a charge for a couple hours). I know, the battery thing is bad luck, but I know at least 5 other people with the same phone, and they&#39;ve all had problems with it. I have until January or February until my contract is up with Verizon, so I&#39;m stuck with them until at least then.<br /><br />I&#39;ve been looking around online at different plans/providers, and for what I&#39;d use it for (200-300 minutes a month peak, not too many text or picture messages), it seems like T-Mobile would be a good fit for me, and it&#39;ll be cheaper than my current plan with Verizon, and it seems like they have quite a few free phone choices. Anyone around here use T-Mobile? How&#39;s the service? I generally spend my time in Queens, Manhattan, Brooklyn, Westchester, and Southern Fairfield County, CT (all heavily populated, &quot;busy&quot; areas), so I was just wondering if anyone had any issues with getting a signal with them. Honestly, that&#39;s my main concern, since I don&#39;t have a landline and this will be my primary phone.<br /><br />Of course, I&#39;m open to other providers as well, except Cingular. Its a long story from about 5 years ago, and I don&#39;t feel like typing the whole thing out. But whoooo boy, do I hate Cingular. (Again, it was mostly bad luck on my end, but when a customer service rep calls you an &quot;inept fool&quot;, you tend to hold a grudge. I&#39;m smart, really!)

				I&#39;ve used T-Mobile here since early last year and service has never been a problem around here, or near any heavily populated area. I haven&#39;t had any other problems with them either. And I hated Cingular when I used it.

				You can also get a really good deal from Verizon by calling their disconnection department and list off all the reasons you just gave above and tell them you are switching. Chances are they will set you up. I&#39;m a T-Mobile guy myself.
