				Tweeze, wax, thread, or au naturale? <br /><br /><br />I just had my eyebrows threaded for the first time at a place on 44th and Bway. It wasn&#039;t bad, not nearly as painful as waxing, and a lot quicker than if I had plucked them myself (which is what I&#039;ve been doing for months). However, I must say that the lady kept like .. tsk tsk tsking me because she said I hadn&#039;t done them in so long (which isn&#039;t really true because I plucked them like a week ago, it&#039;s just that since I don&#039;t have bushy eyebrows I don&#039;t <em>shape</em> them, I just sort of clean them up a bit) and she also kept telling me how bad I need a facial and how dry my skin is and how bad it needs to be exfoliated. I didn&#039;t ask if they offered that service, because I have never, nor will I ever, get that done. <br /><br />So the whole experience left me wondering what other girls do about their eyebrows.

Personally, I prefer to tweeze. But there are lots of threaders in the city so you can probably find one who won&#039;t tsk you.

				There is one on Steinway midblock between 30th and 28th Aves. About 2 weeks after they opened, they added a sign on the door, &quot;for womens only&quot;. So maybe this question is for the gentlemen of Astoria as well.&nbsp; Personally, I am going for the weird bushy mad-scientist effect, so I avoid these places.

				I was at the barber last summer and there were these three guys (who were not gay) that were discussing the best place on Ditmars to get the eyebrows threaded.&nbsp; As a gay man I thought this was pretty amusing since I have never even considered this myself.

				i used to get threaded at Priti Women on Broadway (i think they opened up another store on Steinway just past broadway) and i&#039;ve seen lots of guys get their eyebrows threaded. nothing wrong with a guy getting his eyebrows cleaned up!<br /><br />threading is good-- if you have a good person doing your eyebrows, you will get a nice shape, and your skin will not get irritated like it does when it gets waxed. (ie bright red, sometimes, break outs...)<br /><br />i&#039;ve been getting my eyebrows waxed at SPAce, mostly because it&#039;s more convenient to where i live, and the lady that i&#039;ve gotten has done an excellent job of shaping my brows. <br /><br />i hate tweezing. <br /><br />i&#039;ve seen an eyebrow threading place on 23rd ave near 31st street, but i do not know anything about them, if anyone has any reviews, please let us know! :)

				I tweeze as necessary. I don&#039;t think I could allow someone near my eyes with hot wax, and eh. I just don&#039;t like the waxed eyebrow look much anyway and I think it would look strange on me. But yeah, I agree that it sounds like that lady was trying to get you to spend more money there in the rudest way possible.

				I have waxed a few times in the city to get a &quot;shape,&quot; but otherwise, tweeze and trim at home and follow the same shape. (Payed from $15-30 a few years back.) Every once in a while I think, oh maybe it&#039;s time to get them professionally shaped, so I might try threading in Astoria. I&#039;d be curious to hear what other people&#039;s experiences are of that in the &#039;hood. But the redness is really your personal skin type also, not necessarily the gentleness of the person administering it, unless they&#039;re a total butcher. It&#039;s too bad about the original poster&#039;s experience. I do not like going back to a place that tries to upsell me on stuff or makes me feel bad about myself/habits. It&#039;s not really professional and in the end, doesn&#039;t make the real sale.

				Mine get a little out of shape, but I mostly don&#039;t do anything about them because I&#039;ve very light blonde and you can barely see them.&nbsp; But I&#039;ve been considering dying my eyebrows to a dirty blonde since I&#039;m sick of looking like I&#039;m eyebrow-less in pictures.&nbsp; Has anyone here done this before?

				I&#039;m pretty high-maintenance so this is right up my alley.<br /><br />Actually, I&#039;ve been having my brows waxed for about 15 years. <br />They&#039;re not naturally bushy or problematic, but I&#039;d rather pay a pro<br />to do the things that I would mess up.<br /><br />Anyway, the woman who takes care of me is at Sothys Spa on <br />West 57th between 5th &amp; 6th Aves. Her name is Janna Moerin and<br />she&#039;s the best! She&#039;s even been raved about on Daily Candy and she<br />really is good.<br /><br />And sweet - no lectures, no reprimands, etc. Just a calm manner,<br />expert hands and a pretty painless procedure. Plus you&#039;ll look amazing.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the link to the Daily Candy review:<br />http://www.dailycandy.com/new_york/article/23063/Just+Browsing<br /><br /><br />

				I actually enjoy tweezing my own eyebrows, along with painting my own toenails and other maintenance such as this.&nbsp; I like the solitude and silence of these acts.&nbsp; I also don&#039;t have the extra cash to give away on such a routine basis.

				Me too, Daisy. I tweeze and do my own nails. I like doing my own nails, especially on a quiet afternoon on a day off. I spent a little extra money on good quality nail polish and seche vite top and base coat which makes it worthwhile.

				yea, I wish I could do my own stuff. I do the tweasing but if I attempted my nails Id look like a clown. And I can barely reach my toes to cut them, I imagine the angles for painting would be impossible.

				I tweeze my eyebrows, but I&#039;m not very hairy, so it&#039;s just a matter of taking out a few in the center, a few underneath.&nbsp; I&#039;ve shave my legs &amp; underarms (both summer only), and Bikini Touch my bikini area.&nbsp; I do my own manicures and pedicures.&nbsp; <br /><br />What I can&#039;t do is shape my nails.&nbsp; Looking around the boards, it looks as if Eve&#039;s on 30th Ave is getting good reviews.&nbsp; Do they speak English well there?&nbsp; I need to find out if the shape of the cuticle-end of my nails can be changed as well as the tip end.<br /><br />I still don&#039;t understand brow threading.&nbsp; How do they get a row of your brow hairs into the thread loops?&nbsp; <br /><br />I also have a wax question.&nbsp; One time I decided to shave off all my bikini area hair.&nbsp; This went well untill I realized that hair doesn&#039;t just grow on the outside of the pubic area, some of it grows from inside the curved lips.&nbsp; Since this inner area is moist and soft, you can never get the razer to actually shave it.&nbsp; God knows, you don&#039;t want to accidentally get a nick anywhere inside!&nbsp; I was left with this ugly little tuft of hair that looked like a little beard sticking out of me and I couldn&#039;t do anything about it.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t have a boyfriend at the time and realized I needn&#039;t bother looking for one till the hair grew out.&nbsp; Does a Brazillian wax take that hair out???&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				I&#039;m Armenian, so regular eyebrow maintenance is a must.&nbsp; :wink:<br /><br />I&#039;ve gone to Asha on 28th Ave right off of Steinway for threading, but while my eyebrows have looked great, it hurt like hell and took forever. Instead I&#039;ve been going to Kiki&#039;s Nails on 30th Avenue and 35th Street for waxing -- quick, relatively painfree, and they do a good job. <br /><br />

				Starwind51 try the bikini thing while showering. The water helps the razor glide. Also, you need a fresh razor. You&#039;ll have a cleaner shave with a sharp blade without the risk of nicks and cuts. :-)
