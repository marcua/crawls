				Some recent pieces about crime in the papers. Can someone lookup and post the links on the city website on crime? <br /><br />Its broken down by community board and published monthly. <br /><br />All the politicans and community board people I am sure get regular updates.<br /><br />http://www.qgazette.com/news/2006/0208/Front_Page/<br /><br />http://www.qgazette.com/news/2006/0208/features/016.html<br /><br />http://www.qgazette.com/news/2006/0315/features/026.html<br /><br />http://www.qgazette.com/news/2006/0315/features/008.html<br /><br />They gave us a great update on crime,&quot; former City Council Speaker Peter Vallone Sr. said of the meeting. <br /><br />In addition to his verbal report, McCarthy gave a 20-minute slide presentation on crime in the precinct and Vallone Jr., chair of the council Public Safety Committee, reported on public safety in Astoria and throughout the city. &quot;We were all very pleased with the public safety report,&quot; Vallone Sr. said.<br /><br />So you are going to the precinct meeting and tell them about something they do not already know (after all they go over the stats every month)?!?! <br /><br />Or will things now change because the public will show up?<br /><br />Think it will make more sense to organize, then go to the precinct meetings.<br />

				Jonathan, a group is already meeting to discuss this problem, not a block away from the location of where the stuff happened.<br /><br />If you cannot attend the LICA meeting tomorrow (I for one have never been there but am intrigued by their grassroots efforts), then I am sure people this board will keep you posted.<br /><br />So folks, lets see what that LICA group is made of. &nbsp;I have never been to their meetings, I am impressed by their website and the position they are taking on development and quality of life issues (which they posted while Vallone is saying everying is ok in the crime department back in March)<br /><br />So lets see what they have to say.

				Why not join up with LICA? &nbsp;If they already have an activist part to their website, they must have some experience. &nbsp;Why re-invent the wheel? &nbsp;Besides, there is more mower in numbers. &nbsp;I think I saw someone from &nbsp;LICA already post on this site that there is a meeting tomorrow night at 7 at 35-20 Broadway. &nbsp;It would make more sense to come out and talk abotu this there. &nbsp;

				It would be great to have 10 groups meeting!!<br /><br />But do not think that you are going to tell the elected officials, community board, and precinct council things they don&#39;t already know .... remember everyone was saying things are swell just a few months ago.<br /><br />Just don&#39;t want people to be a backdrop for yet another press conference full of platitudes, or as they say, sound and fury that signifies nothing.<br /><br />Only grassroots can make things change.

				i think jonathan is saying in addition to thise meetings, for those of us who can&#39;t make it anyway-we can organize our thoughts and stuff, am i right? if you can get to those meetings already taking place thats great and i totally think everyone should, but i know i can&#39;t tomorrow so weds at the peach for an informal gathering sounds about right for me this week.

				LICA could be a good thing, but I&#39;m not interested in fighting development - not saying it&#39;s not a worthy battle, just not where I would chose to invest myself. <br /><br />Violent hate crimes, however, are a big problem and definitely a problem I would chose to invest myself in fighting. (I think that was a bad sentence but I&#39;m not looking back).<br /><br />So if it turns out that LICA doesn&#39;t have problem with suddenly acquiring a dozen or more members who have their own agenda and may have differing values from their established mission, and want to take up a good chunk of the meeting talking about their concerns, cool. It&#39;s possible that they would be very happy to see us. <br /><br />In the meantime, it doesn&#39;t hurt for neighbors to get together and talk about what their concerns and ideas are - whether it&#39;s just a couple of meetings to discuss options and we eventually join an existing group, or decide that we can best serve our purpose by starting our own.<br /><br />I don&#39;t have that much going on at night :) I can DO multiple meetings!

				Enigmacat and Flooz, thank you and I agree with all you said.&nbsp; From the LICA meeting reminders here on astorians, it seems to be about development issues and it seems to me that our concern now is about crime and its prevention.&nbsp; If some of us in here can meet up for dinners, why cant we meet up for more important issues?&nbsp; Whats the problem?<br /><br />I am simply suggesting a group of like minded people meet up and talk.&nbsp; People can attend any meetings they like.

				Tuesday nights are tough for me. I cannot make it to the LICA meeting tommorrow so I thought <strong>Jonathan&#39;s idea </strong> was good: an informal meeting on Wed at the FP for those of us who can&#39;t go to the LICA. Will some superhero go to both Tues and Wed meetings to synchronize agendas and report on the developments at the meeting that some of us can&#39;t make it to?<br /><br />Wed after work... 7pm or after?

				Interesting comment on development re LICA.<br /><br />I do not know anyone that wants to tear down a 150 year old church for Fedders junk, and, about 90% of Queens (including {gasp} Peter Vallone) is looking at down zoning, so do not write off LICA over those issues. &nbsp;They seem to be doing things that are pretty much standard for the rest of the borough (although not yet Astoria, which makes some of you bashful, I am certain)<br /><br />But the thing that impresses me is the scope of their interest, from sanitation, to noise, to crime. I do not understand how they can effectively cover all this, but if they have any degree of savvy, then they had better accept that no one wants everything on their site (I certainly don&#39;t) but everyone want something there (I think you all agree to that) <br /><br />Besides, it gives different groups a chance to learn about each others concerns. There may be some impact that these different strand have on each other.<br /><br />Grassroots? God bless &#39;em. Lets see what they have to say.<br /><br />

				The nice thing about a 6:30 meeting at FP is that we could let the AFPJ people know what we are doing and they might have good ideas themselves, as an activist group.&nbsp; Just a thought.<br /><br />Another idea is Wassi, that new coffee place on 28th Ave.&nbsp; It seems pretty quiet and not particularly crowded when I&#39;ve walked by.<br /><br />Waltz is another option, as is the Albatross bar (our local GLBTQ bar) on 37th at 24th Ave.&nbsp; At a time like 6:30 it may be pretty quiet there.

				From what I see from the LICA website, they seem to be interested in everything concerning all aspects of quality of life issues so I don&#39;t think this is out of their interest. &nbsp;It seems overdevolopement might be their topic at the moment. &nbsp; I know scheduling is hard and different days are better for some to meet. &nbsp;I am glad to see the people here are ready to stand up and take action. &nbsp;We need to pull togethere and make our voices heard.

				The location is not too big of a deal for me... I just thought we might be galvanized by meeting at a location close to 34th and Bway so people who don&#39;t usually frequent that corner can get a good sense of what JoePocky and his friend were dealing with-- granted, its not rowdy there on a Wed night at 7pm but nevertheless you can see really how ridiculous it is that people were attacked on such a major intersection and yet no police action we know of...?<br /><br />Whatever venue, I vote Wed at 7pm.<br /><br />And I still plan on stopping into the St. James Deli at 34th ave to give them a piece of my mind.

				JoePocky , I am going to the LICA meeting on Tuesday. They seem to be pretty well organized and informed. Wednesday is bad for me. <br /><br />I emailed the LICA folks and asked if they were going to discuss this. <br /><br />They responded saying that they would be delighted for you to have a spot on their Tuesday schedule, that they want to put your direct experiences up on the website, and as for the Wednesday group, asks that that they send updates on thier progress to LICA at&nbsp; info@licalliance.org. They will post it publically for you.<br /><br />Looking forward to meeting those people tomorrow, and hopefully you too, Joe!<br /><br />Astoria is one hell of a place, eh?

				I don&#39;t see why they can&#39;t but having never been to a meeting, have no idea who they are or what to expect.<br /><br />Suggest you contact them directly. I was surprised they got back to me quickly. They seem to be indifferent to turf battles with giving your group an opportunity to post on their site.<br /><br />info@licalliance.org<br /><br />Any group that can put up that website and content must know a hell of a lot about the area so I am going to see what they have to say myself.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Thanks, Welling. I think the consensus is so far is that if people can make it to the LICA meeting tonight (Tues), they should, if anything to see how to get involved with an established grassroots organization in any capacity. <br /><br />But I think people also wanted to meet tomorrow night, informally, as concerned neighbors and friends to talk about important issues regarding safety in general and Saturday night&#39;s incident in specific. We can set forth some goals, too, like outlining a statement or some questions for the upcoming precinct meeting.<br /><br />Ideally we would have some cross-over and people attending both meetings will be able to share what they&#39;ve learned with people who couldn&#39;t attend the one or the other.<br /><br />I will call the Cafe Bar jsut to give them a heads-up about Wednesday night, but I highly doubt there would be a problem.

				I contacted Anne at Pete Vallone&#39;s local office and gave her details of both tonight&#39;s and Wednesday night&#39;s meetings. Suggested that since he is such a strong anti-crime politician it might be advisable to at least have a representative of his office attend both meetings. Told her that his Dad and his Grandad would have canceled any other obligation(s) to attend both meetings as their primary interest was the local Astoria/Long Island City community. Additionally suggested that he, minimally, read this thread and actively participate in it showing his constituents that he really cares about us.<br /><br />Perhaps a few more local calls will set him on fire! 718-274-4500<br /><br />I regret that due to health issues I will be unable to attend either meeting, but I am counting on you good folks to keep us informed as to the discussions at both meetings.<br /><br />If possible, would someone be able to take minutes of the meetings and transcribe them in this thread?

				NYCMacUser,<br /><br />I would suggest (and this is only a suggestion) that we meet first before we involve the local electeds.&nbsp; This will give us a chance to get better organized.&nbsp; If a rep of an elected shows up to the first meeting they will probably see too much chaos for their liking and dismiss our group before it gets off the ground.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am all for working with electeds, the community board and the precinct in the future but I think we should get our ducks in a row first.&nbsp; <br /><br />Hope this helps...?<br /><br />Mark

				I&#39;ve been speaking with Councilmember Vallone, Jr.&#39;s office and Assemblymember Gianaris&#39;s office.&nbsp; They have both been speaking with the 114 and pushing them to take action.&nbsp; We got the Hate Crimes Unit of the NYPD involved and the Queens DA&#39;s office as well.&nbsp; I have a lot of confidence that they will re categorize this attack as a hate crime in the near future.<br />Personally I wouldn&#39;t suggest bring elected official reps to the meeting tomorrow night, but we should brief them (after the meeting) as to what actions we think should be taken, once we all sit down and figure out a course of action.&nbsp; We might get local civic leaders or District Leaders (local activists) to get involved as well - that helps build some momentum and brings additional resources into the equation.&nbsp; Aside from LICA are there any other community groups to contact?&nbsp; I&#39;m not personally aware of any block associations down in this part of Astoria, but I haven&#39;t really looked to find them either.

They will decide if attending *any* meeting is worth their while. The more phone calls they get, from different sources, the better they will be received. Their *people* are either inherited or hired for their ability to be polite and make/take copious notes on each call. <br /><br />As an old political hack, I am here to tell you that having the press at *any* meeting of concerned citizens is far more important than any politician. <br /><strong><br />NOTE TO ALL:</strong> about our <strong>mcdirk</strong><br />Dirk McCall, Advisory Board Member, Dirk, the President of the Stonewall Democratic Club of NYC, is a transplanted Southerner living in NYC for over 15 years. Raised in a military family, Dirk grew up on Army bases throughout the South, though his family hails from Central Tennessee and North Georgia. A 12 year resident of Astoria, in Western Queens, Dirk was one of the Grand Marshalls for the 2005 Queens Pride Parade. An active member of the Powhattan Democratic Club and Astoria Kiwanis, Dirk is also active with Trinity Lutheran Church of Astoria and Lutherans Concerned, North America, which seeks to make progress within the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA). Dirk founded and lead the LGBT Caucus of New York State Young Democrats and remains an active supporter of YDA.<br /><br />Professionally, Dirk serves as the Director of External Affairs for QSAC (Quality Services for the Autism Community), the largest autism services agency in NYC. Dirk works to promote awareness of autism and advocates for increased funding for the vital services needed by people with autism. Previously Dirk served for four years as the Chief of Staff to NYC Council Member Alan Jay Gerson (District 1 – Lower Manhattan, including Ground Zero). Dirk was one of the leaders in the fight to secure an additional 1.3 million for services for homeless LGBT Youth from the New York City Council, served as the point person inside the Council for DASA (Dignity in All Schools Act), which was introduced by his boss, Council Member Gerson, and helped spearhead the passage of a resolution calling for the repeal of the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell Policy.<br /><br />Dirk has worked as a lobbyist for two firms, Capalino + Company and KZA (Kathy Zamechansky and Associates), where he worked in the areas of nightlife, real estate development and health care, and where he honed his political fundraising skills. He also worked for three years as the LGBT liaison and Community Affairs staff for Manhattan Borough President C. Virginia Fields.

				that&#39;s a decent bio of me - where&#39;d you find it?&nbsp; just curious!<br />I know from talking with the offices that they&#39;d like to hear what we&#39;re proposing moreso than being asked to attend an additional meeting where they might be expected to formulate our gameplan for us.<br />I haven&#39;t, and don&#39;t, discourage calls to any of the offices - the more we can generate the better, e-mails doubly so as they don&#39;t tie up phone lines.&nbsp; &nbsp;I do, however, think that we should know what we want them to do (aside from what they&#39;re already doing which is putting pressure on the 114th Precinct) before we pull elected officials, or their representatives, into a meeting.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am sure they, or their staff, are reading the website, at least I hope they are!&nbsp; <br />I know when I went to meetings (in my former capacity as Chief of Staff to a Councilmember) of community activists who didn&#39;t know what they wanted, it was often somewhat frustrating as people hadn&#39;t always thought things through ahead of time.&nbsp; I usually found that when they&#39;d gotten together before bringing me in, and had some ideas of what they wanted, I was able to help them achieve it.&nbsp; <br />From my reading of the website and recollection, I think the purpose of this meeting was to 1 - recap what happened near the site, 2 - discuss the precinct council meeting and how precinct councils operated and 3 - to come up with a game plan for that meeting (and possibly 4 - to hear what happened at the LICA meeting taking place tonight, as well as 5 - to figure out who else to reach out to.<br />With regard to Trinity - come on by - it&#39;s a wonderful congregation - very welcoming and friendly!&nbsp; :)

				I went to tonight&#39;s LICA meeting and posted my notes under Community groups because there was already a LICA thread started there. <br /><br />What I didn&#39;t mention in my notes was an idea that I brought up that strangers at the meeting seemed pretty psyched about although my husband seemed less than excited about the prospect. <br /><br />I carry a camera phone with me all the time (well, when I remember to) and I know many of you carry cameras regularly.&nbsp; I think it would be great if we would start shooting pictures of &quot;incidents&quot; and posting them on an Astoria website dedicated to <br /><br />crime, law breaking, grafitti<br /><br />They say a picture is worth 1000 words.&nbsp; One photo of &quot;evil doers&quot; (can&#39;t help myself) could be worth lots and lots of phone calls to 311.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#39;m not advocating putting yourself in danger - maybe start with the less dangerous... grafitti, smoking violations, trash dumped behind major chain stores sitting for weeks. <br /><br />does anyone want to take up the task of starting a photo VIOLATION website??&nbsp;

				Gatorboy -<br />That vote took place before I even joined the church (I thought it was a Missouri Synod denomination) and was a church council vote - I&#39;m not on the church council, just a member of the congregation, so I didn&#39;t have a vote, but you can talk with the church council if you have questions about their plans.&nbsp; I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve said much about development on the board - my position would depend on the project and what was being proposed.&nbsp; Working for Councilmember Gerson I fought quite a few projects, but I have also worked on the development side, in community affairs, finding compromises with local community groups, so I think I can appreciate both sides of any proposal.&nbsp; I haven&#39;t personally been involved in any land use projects in Queens.&nbsp; Negotiation as projects move through approval processes (if it&#39;s not an as-of-right project) is usually a good thing, though sometimes bad projects do get approved.

				My mother-in-law will be in town tomorrow, so I won&#39;t be able to attend the meeting, but hope that someone will take notes.<br /><br />Just out of curiosity, as someone who is unfamiliar with the area where this incident took place, is it just an issue of racism/homophobia, or is there also tension between Astoria old-timers and new-comers?&nbsp; I live closer to Northern Blvd., and my neighborhood is very mixed and pleasant, although now I am taking a closer look at those kids on the skateboards...

				Well thanks for your posting, and I respect your position. <br /><br />Its a shame that churches are now being used again and again as a Trojan horse to get totally out of character block busting development into communities ... your project is almost a mirror image of the disastrous Presbyterian project only a few blocks away.<br /><br />For the record, the church council has repeatedly refused a meeting with the community.<br /><br />That being said, you and I both said our piece, now back to the original thread.<br /><br />(Though I would love for everyone to know that Rev Recla after the vote retired to Florida within weeks. Commissions anyone? Now thats leadership!)<br /><br />(Oh, and one final note, why does the block not get a say on what does/or does not go up, or are they just part of the scenery - a most curious way a church relates to a community, don&#39;t you say?)

				I like the photo violation idea - especially where it pertains to graffiti.&nbsp; If you can get pictures of a crime being committed, that is wonderful, just don&#39;t get attacked.&nbsp; &nbsp;I want to see the gang that attacked Joe caught before they get a chance to go after someone else.

				I have company but don&#39;t know yet what&#39;s on tap for tomorrow night.&nbsp; You can add me as a slight possibility to the list, if you need to know maximum numbers.<br /><br />I&#39;m fairly new to the board but pretty concerned about these stories.&nbsp; At 36th Ave just now I noticed police flyers about an anti-gay incident at 5:45 a.m. on 6/11 outside the 36th Ave station, which sounds reminiscent of the Broadway/34th Street story.&nbsp; <br /><br />This is New York in the twenty-first century, and we shouldn&#39;t even have to worry about these things for ourselves, or for our brothers and sisters.&nbsp; This is one of the most diverse neighborhoods in the United States, a country that prides itself on diversity, and while there are of course going to be stumbling blocks, we can&#39;t sit by and just let these things happen.<br /><br />If I can&#39;t make the meeting, I applaud everyone who can and will be anxiously waiting to hear what else I can do.

				Thanks Jonathan, thats a great idea to start with something concrete.<br /><br />I don&#39;t think we should be hung up on limitations and negativity right now. I am just as cynical as everyone else about the efficacy of our local politicians and law enforcement but for the sake of progress I am trying to suspend that jaded part of me just so that we as neighbors and friends can come together, have an open dialogue first and foremost, and also make strides toward organizing an action group. At this infant stage, it doesn&#39;t empower us to dwell on the roadblocks ahead. If we are passionate and organized, I am confident that we can make anything happen.<br /><br />Along those lines, I reiterate Jonathan&#39;s request for everyone attending to <span class="bbc_u">print out the LICA information from the link above</span>.<br /><br />I will make up a &quot;sign-in&quot; sheet so we can have an e-mail list started as well.<br /><br />In interests of efficiency, let&#39;s please stick to [what I think is] the topic tonight: <br />safety issues and incidents of violent crime in Astoria in general, and the attack on JoeP et al. in specific. <br />I am glad that this thread is stirring up the activism in many people but if we start talking about other neighborhood political issues like over-development, we&#39;ll be there all night. &nbsp;<br /><br />I like the list of concerns that McDirk outlined for discussion and will propose a modification of it here as an informal agenda for tonight:<br /><br /><div style="text-align: left;"><em>1 - recap what happened near the site &amp; discuss related safety issues<br />2 - discuss the precinct council meeting and how precinct councils operate<br />3 - come up with a game plan for that meeting <br />4 - hear what happened at the LICA meeting on Tues<br />5 - figure out who else to reach out to.</em></div>See you all tonight!

				Just don&#39;t get seduced by reassuring comments and feigned surprise from certain quarters. <br /><br />Remember, those guys are where they are not because they are school boys, and have had their hands on the levers of power before many of you were born. There are some very very good reasons why the community&#39;s leadership has not changed for generation(s).<br /><br />Astoria has always been, in politics, somewhat regarded as a plantation .... a closed shop when it comes to information and access ... and real power to do things. <br /><br />The novelty of free thinking and free wheeling discussion may be regarded as a threat.<br /><br />That being said, &quot;over the top, lads!&quot;

				I am a Long Island City Alliance member and have learned much about the increasing crime (and general mayhem) from reading this strand. <br /><br />Many, if not most residents are not aware that as of April 25, the number of police officers at the 114 Precint here has dropped from 300 to 194. Demanding more is key to safety.<br /><br />Why are there no foot patrol policemen on duty in the night-late night hours along Broadway, where residents have complained repeatedly?<br /><br />What is the tie between the increasing tendency of landlords - especially around Ditmars near the waterfront - who are housing several individuals in 1-2 family homes? There are reports of up to 12 transients living in such residents. Many of these low-income residents are just hard-working people getting a foothold here. But there are reports of Mexican gang members using grafitti to &quot;mark&quot; their turf, especially in the Astoria Boulevard area.<br /><br />Last, there is an ongoing rash of daytime burglaries in Astoria - so many that the police have nicknamed the area as a corridor of such incidents. Thieves prey on commuter&#39;s apartments. Haven&#39;t read much media coverage about that - I have learned more from this site.<br /><br />As long as our politicians continue allowing massive overdevelopment in Astoria, the crime will increase. Unfortunately, Community Board #1 members are the worst for allowing developers to pour in. There is too much conflict of interest there.

				I like the 5 step action plan on the LICA site - it&#39;s helpful as a conceptual framework and is a good starting point for community organizing.&nbsp; I&#39;m looking forward to the meeting tonight and meeting folks in person.<br />I&#39;m very sad to report, however, that I got a very distressing email this morning.&nbsp; The email talked about signs that the NYPD had put up on 36th Avenue about a gay bashing down there.&nbsp; My initial thought was that it was signs about the attack on 34th Street, but the email said there were two separate attacks.&nbsp; I walked down to 36th Avenue and caught the train there this morning and was able to see the signs.&nbsp; There was a second gay bashing in Astoria this weekend, this one on Sunday, June 11.&nbsp; It appears a gay man was attacked as he was leaving the subway station.&nbsp; I will see if I can get more information.&nbsp; This is in Councilmember Gioia&#39;s district and Assemblymember Markey&#39;s district, but the same community board, and I think the same police precinct.&nbsp; When combined with the anecdotal evidence of harassment of people of color by patrons of establishments along the Broadway commercial strip, I think we have a very serious problem brewing and we need to nip it in the bud immediately.

				It&#39;s June, gay pride season, and gay people are more in the media, which incites hatred and attacks.&nbsp; Every year there is a spike around this time, but this year seems like it&#39;s worse than usual.&nbsp; I&#39;ve been in Astoria for 12 years and I&#39;d never heard of a gay bashing in the neighborhood, and now two in one weekend.&nbsp; This is frightening.&nbsp; At least the NYPD has classified the 36th Avenue attack clearly as a hate crime and put up signs.&nbsp; They need to do the same thing for the attack on Joe, Ron and Carlos.

				Jonathan - I think you&#39;re talking about the Pink Panthers (though I think they later changed their name after they got threatened with a lawsuit).&nbsp; They did good work - and it definitely raised awareness of the attacks.&nbsp; Joe and I have been talking with the NYC Lesbian and Gay Anti-Violence Project (AVP) - they&#39;ve been helpful with his case and pointing us in the right direction.&nbsp; AVP was formed as a result of hate crimes in Manhattan and were very involved in the community response to anti-gay murders in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; Should I try and get someone from AVP to join us tonight?&nbsp; It seems like the problem is larger than we&#39;d all previously thought and I&#39;m wondering if we need more allies and advocates to help us plan.

The problem right now is that we don&#39;t have any leadership (or anything defined right now) so with dozens and dozens of people it can easily turn into a big mish mosh.<br /><br />I agree with Jonathan, since this is the first meeting, lets try to keep it to concerned neighbors and friends.

				Gleason, I hope to see you there tonight as well.<br /><br />I am not saying we should limit anything. <br />To clarify: <span class="bbc_u">ANYONE who wants to come is more than welcome</span>.&nbsp; Far be it for me to be the arbiter of admittance. I was responding to McDirk&#39;s conscientious question as to whether we should invite the media or other established groups, or for that matter, politicians.<br /><br />This a meeting for <em>all</em> friends and neighbors, concerned and ready to talk and listen. But I think we all agree that chaotic gatherings are unproductive for everyone. There are also logistics involved to make sure everyone&#39;s voice gets a fair shot at being heard. <br /><br />Sure, democracy&#39;s not neat and tidy. But its not a free-for-all, either. That&#39;s all. Its a moot issues, really, because I am positive that everyone will be polite and receptive and open-minded.<br /><br />I just spoke with Cafe Bar. They were not aware of the incidents. They seemed very receptive to the notion of our taking over a little corner of the couches, etc. They cannot &quot;reserve that space&quot; per se, but the management will try to do something for us.<br /><br />See you all there!<br />

				Hi All,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I too live on 34th and Broadway and I was just informed today of this event.&nbsp; I have lived in my apartment for 6 years and have watched the neighborhood change a lot in that time period.&nbsp; In many ways for the better, but obviously there are also new problems.<br />I would like to suggest to everyone that you talk to your land lords about these problems and your concerns.&nbsp; Many of the land lords in Astoria own several buildings, not just yours, and have a vested interest in keeping them profitable. Not only that, many of them have local connections that could be very beneficial to the cause.&nbsp; I am not able to make the meeting tonight at the Cafe Bar, but I called my land lord and left her a message about it, hopefully she will attend.&nbsp; I know that she is very unhappy about all the bars opening on Broadway. Anyway, hope that it goes well.&nbsp; I would love to hear the outcome and hope to attend future meetings.

				Awesome! Thanks, Jessicat! You bring up a really good point. Activism starts at home, afterall. <br /><br />I will definately talk to my management company since their offices are actually on the corner of 34th and Bway (KSP, Inc). <br /><br />My landlords are total tools but it can&#39;t hurt to write a letter and send it in with upcoming rent money.<br /><br />

				might i suggest that this thread, since being moved to community groups, get it&#39;s own board within this board, a la Astoria EATS. this topic is too important to get buried within other community goings on, and it has illicited a huge amount of replies and views in a short amount of time. <br />i suggest a Community Activism board, where we would have this thread and a delvelopment thread and other threads regarding our other concerns as members of the community and meetings and what not. <br />it just seems to be more streamlined, and we won&#39;t be confined to just one huge thread, we can jump off into other topics of concern while still being in a devoted board.<br />i know i haven&#39;t spoken much in this thread, but it does concern me greatly and i have read every post. i hope to make tonights meeting as well.<br /><br />jenn

				Wow!&nbsp; There are a lot of great ideas here - I&#39;m looking forward to a casual and informal meeting to do a bit of fact finding and then work towards a call to action.&nbsp; <br /><br />But let&#39;s not get too far ahead of ourselves - activism is great - but this issue goes even beyond gay-rights as there are racial issues at hand as well.<br /><br />Maybe we should stay simple and at least open things up to discussing peoples experiences in the area.&nbsp; Once that info is documented we&#39;ll have a better idea of the big picture.<br /><br />My two cents.&nbsp; See y&#39;all there!

				Hey Everyone,<br /><br />It turns out that I am unable to get out of work tonight - its the annual board meeting and crucial that I&#39;m there (I work at a non-profit for autism).<br /><br />However, my roommate and boyfriend will be attending (they were the other two guys that were attacked with me - roommate being the one hit with the bat), and our friend Jason, who had just left us that night before the crime was committed.<br /><br />They will keep me posted. So sorry I am missing it. Really wish I could be present :-\

				Hi Jonathan (and everyone else), it was great to meet you all.<br /><br />I came home fairly pumped and started compiling my own notes.&nbsp; I spent the meeting writing down things I wanted to share with my friends who couldn&#39;t make it, and then realized that the email I had started trying to write could be a pretty useful tool.&nbsp; I was just going to send it to a few friends of mine, but I&#39;d be willing to make it available to anyone who wanted it.&nbsp; I do want to start spreading the word about the incidents and the discussions going on here, because as large as the turnout was tonight, I think that many more people in the neighborhood do want to know and want to be involved.&nbsp; <br /><br />So unless I hear any objections I&#39;m going to try and draft an unofficial &quot;action email&quot; to circulate around people we know in Astoria ASAP.&nbsp; I do want to wait to get the community affairs officer (Cesar?)&#39;s phone number, since calling is going to be a big step that many people can do.&nbsp; <br /><br />One thing I&#39;ve noticed about this neighborhood ever since I moved here is that as large as it is geographically, it&#39;s surprising how many people wind up being a friend-of-a-friend (heck, that was obvious enough tonight - hi Dirk!).&nbsp; I think now would be a great time to start the word of mouth, and I think we could get pretty far pretty quickly.

				What a totally kickass meeting! Special thanks to Jonathan and Dirk for being great moderators, keeping us on track, making sure everyone was heard, and supplying some great information. And of course to Ron &amp; Carlos for sharing more details on the incident (for the 200th time, I&#39;m sure). It was great seeing friends (especially the Ditmars crew!) and meeting new people.<br /><br />Thanks for posting Cesar&#39;s phone number, JD! Now let&#39;s use it by calling him and asking adamantly that this issue be put on the agenda for the meeeting on the 27th!<br /><br />Now if we can get a &#39;boilerplate&#39; outline of talking points up, that would be great!

				Here&#39;s what I came up with.&nbsp; I wanted to be vague on the details of the incidents since I didn&#39;t write anything down and hope I reported everything accurately enough.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#39;m impatient so I&#39;m going to go ahead and start sending this around.&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Background:<br /><br />Over the weekend of June 10-11, one publicized hate crime occurred in the East Village.&nbsp; Two other, less publicized incidents occurred in Astoria.&nbsp; In one incident, a man was attacked outside the 36th Avenue subway station, both physically and with slurs, and bones in his face were broken.&nbsp; In a separate incident, three neighbors were attacked by about eight other men at 34th and Broadway.&nbsp; After a physical altercation involving slurs about race and sexuality, the men then chased them with a baseball bat.&nbsp; One man was refused entrance at the St. James Deli at 34th Street and 34th Avenue and later had to be hospitalized for the injuries he sustained.&nbsp; <br /><br />(NOTE: See http://astorians.com/index.php?topic=2336.0 for the discussion about the 34th Street incident.)<br /><br />While the police are treating these as hate crimes, we as a community need to join together to make sure that these incidents remain isolated and do not become a trend.&nbsp; This is an issue that affects everyone, regardless of race, gender, or orientation.&nbsp; We all want our neighborhood to be safe and comfortable for all.<br /><br />What Can You Do?<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Create an account on http://www.astorians.com.&nbsp; Under &quot;Community Groups &amp; Social Networking&quot;, you should see a thread (or possibly soon a board) concerning these issues and the community response.&nbsp; Read, discuss, get involved, stay aware as things develop.<br /><br />2.&nbsp; Call Cesar, the community affairs officer for the 114th Precinct, at 718-626-9327.&nbsp; Tell him that you want this issue to be on the agenda for the precinct community council meeting on June 27.<br /><br />3.&nbsp; Attend the precinct community council meeting on June 27 at 7 p.m. at Ricardo&#39;s By the Bridge (21st St and 24th Ave).&nbsp; While the police response to the incidents has been attentive (under pressure from some political groups), a more proactive response is needed from the 114th Precinct to prevent further incidents.<br /><br />4.&nbsp; Make sure that your voting address matches your current Astoria address.&nbsp; <br /><br />5.&nbsp; Call 311 when you see quality of life issues in the neighborhood.&nbsp; Overflowing trash, merchants ignoring problems, graffiti, fights.&nbsp; Mayor Bloomberg does respond to clusters of repeated 311 calls, and more calls will mean more resources.&nbsp; Often these issues will lead to more serious quality of life issues.<br /><br />6.&nbsp; Stay tuned to astorians.com for an upcoming flyering campaign to raise awareness.&nbsp; Once it begins, print out the flyers and talk to your building management or any businesses that you frequent about posting them.&nbsp; We want residents to be aware, and we want businesses to advertise being part of the solution.&nbsp; <br /><br />7.&nbsp; Boycott the St. James Deli at 34th St. and 34th Ave., who have been unresponsive to inquiries about the incident.&nbsp; Some neighbors are looking to reignite the old Safe Havens program to identify local businesses that are willing to provide shelter to neighbors in distress.&nbsp; As this develops, be aware of which businesses are involved and demonstrate that you support businesses that support their community.&nbsp; Information should be available at http://www.astorians.com.<br /><br />9.&nbsp; Forward this email to anyone you know in Astoria.<br /><br />10.&nbsp; ...AND THEN STAY INVOLVED!&nbsp; Part of the problem is the disconnect that Astoria neighbors feel.&nbsp; Many of us are renters, many of us spend much of our time in Manhattan, and it&#39;s easy to ignore the community around us.&nbsp; Get to know other people, talk on the board, come to the meetings, come to the social activities.&nbsp; Building a sense of community and unity in the neighborhood will go a long way towards creating the infrastructure we need to combat future problems.<br /><br />Doing any one of these things will help - doing all of them will go even farther.&nbsp; <br /><br />Please feel free to distribute this to anyone you know in the neighborhood.&nbsp; Post on blogs, forward to friends. <br />

				Wow, K this looks amazing! I think you successfully covered all topical issues and by numbering the points, it makes it easier for people to absorb (there&#39;s a lot of information, of course). The only thing I would reccommend is to bullet the important points even more. Less complete sentences, more digestable bytes. Of course, the description of the original incident benefits from a more in-depth explanation but the other 10 points in contrast could be more phrase-like so that people will read the whole document, all the way through. Are you e-mailing this out to people? Superb idea. Tremendous job! I&#39;m going to send it to my next-door neighbors and other locals as well. Is that ok?

				I just want to say that I loved the idea for the town hall and am very much into helping with that.<br /><br />I also liked Jonathan&#39;s idea (I think it was Jonathan) for a way to visually signal our support for a safer astoria - a la the lance armstrong bracelet.

				Nice work Jonathan and Dirk and others. <br /><br />A few years ago a group started PACT (Police and Community Together.) Ask about it when you get to the council. Similar to what you are putting together. Great people, but later disbanded.<br /><br />Learn from their mistakes, build on their strong points. Good Luck!!

				It was great meeting everyone last night.&nbsp; It&#39;s great that things are moving forward and felt we had good energy in the room.&nbsp; I&#39;ve put together first drafts of the Precinct Council meeting talking points and the draft statement, which we&#39;d discussed preparing last night, and am waiting for comments - if you&#39;d like to see the drafts shoot me a private message and I&#39;ll send them over.&nbsp; I hope to have them ready for distribution later today.<br />Second, kudos to Jonathan, Enigmacat, Annie and everyone for putting together the meeting at Cafe Bar last night.&nbsp; It was a great group of people there and it was inspiring.&nbsp; I&#39;m looking forward to working with all of you.<br />Special thanks to SpecialK for her wonderful action email.&nbsp; It is very well done and is clear and direct.&nbsp; I&#39;ll be sending it out to my lists today.<br />Gleason - can you tell us more about PACT?&nbsp; When did it exist, where did it operate, why did it disband and who ran it? (and are they still around?&nbsp; it&#39;d be nice to have more resources!)

				Sure, they were involved in cleaning up and creating Shawn&#39;s Place (near where PS 6 used to be), were active with the council, and the 144 Civ-Op group (whom you must get to know and get involved in).<br /><br />Talk to Ann Bruno (council) and Barb/Jim Pollack in the Civ-Op for contact info.<br /><br />They used to meet over at Quinn&#39;s Gallery (which seems to be the general meeting hall for community groups in the area.)&nbsp;

				I thought the meeting was really terrific.&nbsp; Was so good to see so many people at the Cafe Bar last night!&nbsp; Great community presence.&nbsp; Thanks especially to Jonathan and Dirk as excellent facilitators of the meeting.&nbsp; SpecialK, your action email is awesome, and JD thanks for putting together the contact list.&nbsp; Was also helpful to hear so many first person accounts of incidents from Annie and Eric, and of course Ron, etc who suffered this terrible crime.&nbsp; <br /><br /><strong>Remember, I&#39;ll be at the Freeze Peach Cafe (22-00 29th Street at Ditmars) this Sunday June 18 from 4-8 working my volunteer shift. </strong> 50% of the profits plus tips go towards the organization of my choice, and I&#39;m choosing to put the $$ towards this group.&nbsp; Please come out and have a drink and hang out with your fellow friends and activists, and support our efforts!&nbsp; If you have questions, feel free to pm me.<br /><br />Also, if someone could provide me with a sort of &quot;mission statement&quot; about the group, I can post it on the register to give people a solid idea as to what we&#39;re all about.&nbsp; My intermittent computer access and lack of printer makes this a bit of a challenge for me to do myself.&nbsp; Would love the help!&nbsp; Thanks.

				Looks like something great is coming of this!&nbsp; I will be out of town but would love to hear how the turnout is!<br /><br />March and Rally this Saturday<br /><br />Raise Our Voices Against Anti-LGTB Hate<br /><br />in Our City and in Our Neighborhoods<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />When: Saturday, June 17 <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Where: Gather at NE Corner of 14th Street and First Avenue at 2PM; march at 3PM to Christopher Park (Christopher &amp; West 4th Streets)<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Why: In the last week - as unfortunately happens so often in June - a number of hate incidents have impacted our community in neighborhoods around the city:&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Saturday, June 10, 12:30 AM - East Village, Manhattan <br /><br />On his way home, Kevin Aviance is brutally attacked by a group of men yelling anti-gay slurs <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Saturday, June 10, 1:10 AM - Astoria, Queens <br /><br />A group of three friends are attacked by a larger group yelling anti-gay and racist epithets and wielding a baseball bat <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Sunday, June 11, 5:45 AM - Astoria, Queens<br /><br />A man is followed off of an &quot;N&quot; train by another man who harassed him with anti-gay language, pushed him down elevated platform exit stairs to the street, and kicked and punched repeatedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Make your voice heard...<br /><br />...we will not be targeted even as we celebrate our History, our Pride and our Survival...<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Stand up and be counted Saturday...but anti-LGTB hate happens all year long...<br /><br />...what you will do to help stop anti-LGTB hate and help those who fall victim to it after the March is over... <br /><br />Community Partners in this Effort include: the NYC Gay &amp; Lesbian Anti-Violence Project, Daniel Dromm, Empire State Pride Agenda, Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, Gay Men of African Descent, Hedda Lettuce, Lambda Independent Democrats of Brooklyn, the Latino Commission on AIDS, Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer, mano a mano, the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, New York State Black Gay Network, NYC Council Member Rosie Mendez, NYC Council Speaker Christine Quinn, NYS Assembly Member Deborah Glick, NYS Assembly Member Sylvia Friedman, NYS Senator Tom Duane, People of Color in Crisis, Unity Fellowship Church of Christ, list in formation<br /><br />Safety Tips<br /><br />Please note that none of the following is a guarantee of safety, they&#39;re only tips that can be helpful: <br /><br />1. Be aware of your surroundings<br /><br />Who&#39;s around you? <br />What are they doing? <br />Are they paying attention to you? <br />2. Try not to travel alone: <br /><br />Traveling in groups can sometimes (but by no means always) dissuade likely attackers. Hate violence perpetrators are cowards and there are almost always more of them than there are of you.&nbsp; <br />3. Don&#39;t let your guard down just because you&#39;re in a &quot;queer&quot; area:<br /><br />About 25% of anti-LGTB incidents in the New York area happen in places that we&nbsp; &nbsp;think of as being &quot;safe&quot; for our community: in or around bars, nightclubs or LGTB institutions, streets in LGTB-identified areas of the city, and cruising areas.&nbsp; <br />4. What to do if you are the victim of an incident:<br /><br />If you need immediate assistance, call 911 <br />Report the incident to the Anti-Violence Project at: 212-714-1141; our counselors and volunteers are here to help you 24 hours a day. All services are free and confidential. <br />5. What to do if you witness an incident:<br /><br />Call 911 if someone is in immediate danger. <br />Make it clear to 911 what the danger is; this may make the difference in getting a quicker response. <br />Call the Anti-Violence Project&#39;s 24-hour, bilingual hotline (212-714-1141) to let them know what you&#39;ve seen. <br />If you speak with the victim(s), share the Anti-Violence Project’s hotline number and encourage them to call the Anti-Violence Project. There are probably supports and services that can help them pay medical bills, get free support and other services.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

				More on PACT:<br /><br />The park&#39;s name that they fixed up was Sean&#39;s Place.<br /><br />The formed about 1994 (+/-) &nbsp;and shut down about 2000. <br /><br />When they disbanded, as I recall, they said something to the effect that &quot;they accomplished what they set out to do.&quot;

				As bad as hate crimes are, remember the problem is much much worse. <br /><br />http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=16795570&amp;BRD=2731&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=574903&amp;rfi=6<br /><br />A number of people have been KILLED at the clubs in Astoria recently! <br /><br />Remember the SUV trying to run down people on the sidewalk on Steinway Street earlier this year?<br /><br />http://www.wnbc.com/traffic/6702843/detail.html<br /><br />This news link is from a murder that occured at a club LAST year.

				Below are the final talking points - use them when writing letters and preparing remarks for the 114th Precinct Community Council meeting.&nbsp; Shoot me a pm if you need any additional information.&nbsp; I&#39;ll post some addresses later today.<br />Best wishes,<br />Dirk<br />----<br />Talking Points for the upcoming June 27th<br />114th Precinct Community Council Meeting<br /><br />1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two attacks on gay men, one of which also had a racist component, are alarming and appear to be a possible dangerous trend.<br />2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need additional community policing on Broadway, as well as other commercial strips such as Steinway, 36th Avenue, 30th Avenue and Ditmars, on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays when people who do not live in Astoria come to our neighborhood for our nightlife establishments, especially from 10 p.m. until 4 a.m.&nbsp; Some people seem to feel free to act out in Astoria in ways that they would not do in their home communities, which is part of our problem.<br />3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need more enforcement of the drinking age – it appears that many underage patrons are being served in our local bars, clubs and cafes.<br />4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Astoria is a great place because of the diversity of the community.&nbsp; Attacks on any group are attacks on all of us and can not be tolerated.<br />5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to enter into a dialogue with local merchants and business associations about renewing a safe haven program, and generally educating them on the importance of neighborhood safety.<br />6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People must feel safe on the street and we need to identify which business establishments will be safe havens and which are the ones which are bringing bad elements into our neighborhood.<br />7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attack on 34th Street MUST be re-classified officially as a hate crime and all three victims, not just the initial complainant, must be listed.<br />8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Signs need to be put up on 34th Street to solicit information as was done on 36th Avenue.<br />9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People need to feel safe on the streets of Astoria, and this is no longer the case, especially on the streets right off Broadway in the nightlife/club zone.<br />10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Better lighting, more attention to trash on the streets and more attention to graffiti is needed to make people realize this is not a neighborhood where anything goes.<br />

				I think this is great!&nbsp; I am a latecomer to all of this, having just found out about this board yesterday (but I&#39;ve lived in Astoria in the same apartment for 7 years, so go figure)&nbsp; As a latecomer to the discussion, maybe my minor issues about the statement have already been addressed in some other forum, if so, forgive me!I am a bit concerned that the semantic focus on hate crimes and diversity may alienate folks who consider themselves &quot;average&quot; and thus not a potential victim of such a crime or those who who are against hate crime legislation as a matter of constitutional law (lots and lots of people feel this way).&nbsp; Instead, why shift a bit towards a more philosophically and socially appealing tact?&nbsp; &nbsp;Most members of the community will agree that the emerging street culture of underage drinking on stoops, hoards of teenagers and young adults yelling through the streets late at night, and the lawlessness of local bars and clubs have led to the increased violence in Astoria.&nbsp; The lack of a coordinated community and police response to the street culture has emboldened not just those who would violently attack gender, sexual, racial, and ethnic minorities on the street, but those who would violently attack <em>anyone </em> on the street.<br />Further, in building an organization we may attract more participants if we state simply, &quot;we want safety!&quot; rather than, &quot;we want safety for all, including x, y, z...&quot; because, frankly, I don&#39;t care if the old lady down the block doesn&#39;t approve of me because I am a lesbian and hates the term diversity.&nbsp; If she is willing to sign a petition and join our group because she, too, wants safety, I consider that a step in the right direction.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=2351.msg16922#msg16922">Quote from: mcdirk on June 16, 2006, 11:48:36 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">PS - in my speed to post, I forgot to say thanks to Lanseaux, Annie and Jonathan for their comments, edits and reworking of the talking points and the Statement, which is posted below.<br />Flooz - do you have an e-mail address where I can send it to you?<br />best wishes,<br />Dirk<br />----<br /><br />ASTORIA UNITE!<br />RESPOND TO RECENT HATE CRIME ATTACKS<br /><br /><br />During the June 10th weekend, two separate instances of unprovoked violence motivated by racism, homophobia and ignorance ripped through Astoria.&nbsp; In the wake of these vicious attacks, which sent two men to the hospital, Astorians of all backgrounds are uniting to take action.&nbsp; We seek to speak up with one voice for tolerance and diversity in the community.&nbsp; We strongly condemn these attacks and urge everyone to get involved.&nbsp; &nbsp;Safety is a basic right for everyone, so let your voice be heard!<br /><br />Join us in:<br />●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly condemning these hate-motivated attacks.<br />●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strongly urging the 114th Police Precinct to quickly apprehend the perpetrators.<br />●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Challenging officials at all levels of government to recognize, respond to and prevent future attacks and violent crime.<br />●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rejecting racist, sexist, anti-gay and anti-immigrant hate language in our community.<br />●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raising awareness of hate crimes of all types.<br />●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Endorsing local merchants and businesses who pledge to support safety for ALL Astorians.<br /><br />Hate has no place in our neighborhood.&nbsp; We resolve to make it clear that violent bias crimes and hate speech are not only unacceptable but to be confronted and denounced by all responsible members of the community. <br /><br />We ask people to join us on Tuesday, June 27, 7 p.m. at the 114th Precinct Community Council meeting at Riccardo’s by the Bridge (21-01 24th Avenue – at 21st Street).&nbsp; <br />Take action now and add your voice to the call for a safer Astoria where all people are valued and accepted, an Astoria which values diversity.&nbsp; Together we can make a difference and build a strong and diverse community free from random acts of violent crime.&nbsp; <br /><br />For details on how you can make a difference in your neighborhood, go to www.astorians.com , where you can get:<br />●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More information on different grassroots organizations<br />●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dates and times of upcoming community meetings<br />●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information on these two terrible attacks and their aftermath<br />●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In depth discussions and updates<br /><br />Stand with us and help us bring Astoria together!<br /><br />(can we put the logo and the name here?)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Great point. <br /><br />And in fact, we wrestled with this matter to some degree at the meeting on Wednesday. But I think the consensus was that the watershed issue that brought us together to meet that night, the raison d&#39;etre, if you will, <strong>was the actual crime(s)</strong> that happened the weekend of June 10th. And since they were by their very nature hate crimes, that is what we sought to address. <br /><br />I think we are all concerned about being totally inclusive and trying to build as much consensus as possible. But the fact is that more and more people are getting either: (a) verbally harassed with slurs, or (2) outright beaten (see anecdotes that fellow astorians are putting up) indicates that the violence and threat of violence are hate-based and therefore even catagorized differently in the eyes of the law than just run-of-the-mill street violence. <br /><br />The Astoria Old Guard is good to have on your side, but they can be apathetic and counterproductive too (that lesbian-hating old lady is harder to reach than we might think). We are trying. But we have to start somewhere.<br /><br />So yes, I agree that we have to be sensitive to the very diversity of the neighborhood we&#39;re trying to promote and protect, but we had to rally around something, something passionate and topical and immediately important. That was hate crime. <br /><br />We aim to expand outward to more general issues, as we had discussed (quality of life issues), but for now, I think we all wanted to raise awareness to the immediate safety issue posed by thugs still-at-large who enjoy randomly assaulting people they perceive as different.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Yet, again, what about the white ethnics getting KILLED!! Or are they not part of your group, so that&#39;s something that can be addressed later?<br /><br />Gay people, as a group, are people the machine is friendly to (after all, most vote Democratic for obvious reasons). The machine is past master at the ability, Zelig-like, to adapt to the flavor of the moment.<br /><br />So are you will undoubtedly get a group hug from the Old Guard, (the same ones telling us everything is ok.) <br /><br />They will give your a photo op of concern and platitudes of comfort (although they were architects (or at least mute observers) for the current mess Astoria is in.)<br /><br />Problem solved. (?!?) <br /><br />I don&#39;t know. Would like to hear ideas from people who were not at that meeting the other night. <br /><br />Interesting points for discussion.

				Gatorboy, I think you just accused us of not caring about white people being killed because we are concerned about hate crimes.<br /><br />By that token, you could accuse me of not caring about world hunger, AIDS, domestic abuse, or the environment because I have joined an organization to fight hate crimes.<br /><br />I&#39;m sure that&#39;s not what you meant to say. It&#39;s clear that you feel really strongly about this and have a lot of ideas and experience, but it would be easier to hear them if your first paragraph weren&#39;t quite so accusatory-sounding.

				My friend, there is not one sensible person that does not support what you are doing. This is really great stuff. <br /><br />But I still believe, that if you are promoting yourself as an organization with a broad community wide interest, the tent should be inclusive.<br /><br />Perhaps, I hope, everthing will turn out ok. But many of us old hands in the community have seen a lot. That experience might, or might, not mean anything. <br /><br />But, as a precaution, it might be instructive to address those issues, and to be concerned that another opportunity for a real change is not yet again, co-opted.<br /><br />

				Well, Gatorboy, I think do hear what you are saying now. But I think that we have good intentions and good ideas and, while we might not do everything the way someone with more experience might do it, we are doing our best and we will have good results. <br /><br />No matter what we do, there will always have been a better way to do it. But to make it 100% perfect (and things can only ever be perfect in ONE person&#39;s estimation at a time!) would mean to delay action indefinitely.<br /><br />I hope we can harness this momentum and trust ourselves to be a force for good, despite our inexperience and any mistakes we may make. We have an amazing array, already, of talented, passionate, intelligent people working on this and I am so excited at what I am seeing that to me, already, the world is changing. <br /><br />The other crimes you mention are definitely part of the problem and, as far as I am concerned, in saying we want a safe astoria we are saying we want it for everyone. From exotic interesting people to boring straight mostly-caucasians like me.

				Great discussion points raised today and I wholeheartedly love the talking points and mission statements.<br /><br />Just wanted to pop in quickly to say that on my way back from the library just now, I saw a number of flyers on 35th Avenue for the rally in Manhattan on Saturday, featuring pictures of Kevin Aviance in full-on drag.<br /><br />It was great to see that the message is getting out there - and I don&#39;t <em>think</em> the flyers were from anybody who&#39;s been on the board yet, since they referenced &quot;two men&quot; in Astoria over the weekend rather than &quot;two incidents&quot; (<em>four</em> men). &nbsp;I briefly considered correcting the flyers but decided that they stood on their own as is, and I was glad to see them on my street.<br /><br />(Can&#39;t make it to the rally on Saturday but I am still planning to attend the precinct meeting on the 27th!)

				I think I may understand what Gatorboy is trying to get at, though I may not entirely have read correctly. I think this may just be a discussion about exactly where the line is drawn. For example, this particular hate-crime was specifically motivated against homosexuals, yet clearly the purpose of the group (so far as I understand it) isn&#39;t limited only to homosexual hate-crimes, but to hate crimes in general. So the line (so far it seems) has gone beyond just the specific incident, and into a slightly more broad area of hate crimes altogher (not just gay hate crimes). The question is how broad should that scope go, Gator may feel it&#39;s not quite broad enough yet for him to feel totally comfortable.<br /><br />Maybe Gator&#39;s concern is just that the scope of the group not be too narrow and thus appear exclusive. To me it seems like it&#39;s just a question about where you draw the line as to the purpose of the group. Is it only a community &quot;anti-crime&quot; group, or is it more broad to include quality of life issues, or intolerance in general, or diversity issues. And is the group focused on only addressing those issues that are unfair towards gays, women, or minorities, or more broadly just as a voice against any and all discrimination altogether. I&#39;m interested in finding this out too, and although I&#39;m horribly disgusted at what happened on broadway, I also have interests in quality of life issues (noise pollution and litter) that I&#39;d love the group to address too. I wasn&#39;t at the meeting though.<br /><br />I think this may be where his ideas may be coming from. Please correct if I&#39;m reading this wrong.<br /><br />Overall, please know that I&#39;m very glad this discussion (in the broad sense) is going on. I think that we&#39;ll make our community better by having a group of people who care about making Astoria a better place.

				I get torn here - there&#39;s an argument for a broad scope that really appeals to me - and then there&#39;s another argument that says we need a narrow scope to be most effective.<br /><br />What i&#39;m thinking is that we&#39;re all in Astoria for the long haul - well, most of us i think - and there are tons of organizations we can join in this neighborhood to help make all kinds of changes - we don&#39;t have to reinvent the wheel for each worthy cause. If it turns out that we have too many people working on reducing hate crimes, we can add a garbage patrol unit - I guess the other thing I&#39;m trying to say is that I think we are heading it the right general direction and we can make adjustments as we go, if they turn out to be necessary.<br /><br />Could be I&#39;m the only one to think so - I&#39;ll shut up now and let someone else discuss.

				thanks to both annie and gatorboy for their comments...I&#39;m not sure to whom each of you are referring when you use the phrase &quot;old guard&quot;. &nbsp;Annie, it seems you are referring to the elderly lady down the block who may not accept lgbt people (a resident), while gatorboy, you seem to be referring to the political establishment. &nbsp;In that sense, you are right, once the cameras are on, the lgbt community has got a lot of false friends. &nbsp;As far as referring to residents as &quot;old guard&quot; I think it veers towards sounding like the sort of gentrifier (if that&#39;s a word) that make folks nervous and attempts to split the political and community ideals of Astoria based upon length of residence, which will only feed the hate. &nbsp;Members of the LGBT community who live in Astoria will then unfairly become easily identifiable symbols of all the changes that some residents don&#39;t like. &nbsp;<br /><br />I was not at the meeting the other night, &nbsp;and thanks for asking for more views--I would hate to think that missing one meeting means missing the boat on developing an organization meant to deal with the neighborhood I&#39;ve called home for so long. &nbsp;I hope to be at future meetings. &nbsp;In the meantime, here is my two sense...I think there should be a little editing to the statement so that it includes hate crime language as well as comments on the general increase in violent and threatening crime and quality of life conditions in the neighborhood. &nbsp;Also, the sort of meeting that we are to attend on Tuesday isn&#39;t usually given to philosophical or humanistic statements, so maybe we should have a list of demands (say 3?4?) for such things as:<br /><br />--Strongly urging the 114th Police Precinct to quickly apprehend the perpetrators and to update the public on a weekly basis about the status of the case<br />--develop a hate crime prevention strategy<br />--increase daily street police presence in Astoria<br />--report the number and <strong>location </strong> of noise and threat complaints reported via 311 (minus car alarms) made for the zip codes protected by the precinct so that the community and police may better know where additional street units are required (they can totally do this---that&#39;s how they are deciding where to send cops in SI on July 4th)<br />&nbsp;<br />these are just off the cuff ideas...but I think some group brainstorming may produce some great results that achieve the objectives we <em>all </em> are working for which is ending the violence in our community and increasing residents sense of safety. &nbsp;

				Re: the big tent<br /><br />Focusing on hate crimes doesn&#39;t necessarily mean the group is being exclusive. One doesn&#39;t have to be a minority of some sort to take interest. One just has to be bothered by the fact that violent crimes are being committed in one&#39;s own neighborhood. If a person doesn&#39;t care about the crimes <em>because</em> the victims are minorities, perhaps they&#39;re not the people you&#39;re trying to reach anyway.&nbsp; Just a thought.

				Thanks for your comments. Now we are getting to the meat of the issue.<br /><br />Its good this stuff is aired. I just think that for a bunch of novices (and we all are, no matter how many scars one has) it makes wise politics to include as many diverse people as possible. <br /><br />Before reaching out the politicians (hate to break the news, but we are telling them stuff they already know) people might want to hold a series of town hall meetings across the length and breath of Astoria. Churches, etc.<br /><br />I think you will be surprised at how these problems are connected. Surprised at how people are unhappy. Surprised that most feel they have no voice. Surprised that people want an opportunity to state what on their mind.<br /><br />In the long run, you might want to choose leadership that has not had previous experience working with politicians and the system. The process taints all of us. This writer included.<br /><br />Post your work on blogs everywhere, myastoria, lic alliance, even Hunters Point, Woodside, and Sunnyside. For the price of an email, literally thousands get the word. Forget ink and paper. <br /><br />Inspire volunteers:&nbsp; learn from SUNN on how to fight graffiti, learn from 114 Civ-Op about patrols, learn from LICA about neighborhood preservation. Encourage responsible public engagement.<br /><br />Above all, dialogue, discuss and debate. The most powerful person on earth is the American voter and tax payer. And most don&#39;t even know it. The public servants like it that way.<br /><br />Why? Public apathy is the problem. If you measure the politicians you might find they are really doing their jobs. If not, its usually not because they are bad people. They just ain&#39;t supervised. That&#39;s the job for all of us.<br /><br />Astoria needs people with fresh faces and fresh approaches. That&#39;s one of the reasons that it is so neat that the local lgbt community has found a voice here. <br /><br />Now look around. You will find ten groups like that hidden in plain site just waiting for the right circumstances to flower forth. They would be ready allies. Give them a chance.<br /><br />A tall order? Hell no! A little work, but with the vigor shown to date, I believe a strong independent community voice is achievable.<br /><br />Wowsers!<br /><br /><br />

				I read Gatorboy&#39;s comments carefully.<br /><br />It seems that he (I assume that gender, but who knows) seems to have built a fairly strong case that the quality of life in Astoria has been going down hill for quite some time. <br /><br />The statistics show that Astoria is ranking below average in a number of key points. This is something the people sense. Comments on this board show a glowering anger in the community that no one cares.<br /><br />Gatorboy seems to believe that this problem has been actively covered up. Certainly all the sugary comments (as few there are) from the community&#39;s elite bear this out.<br /><br />Although I find gay crime reprehensible, I do know Astoria. If you would find one thing that would most be of interest with the general Astoria community, gay concerns are not among the top issues (I leave it to the reader to weigh that point). So, it is rather curious that of all the things facing us, this is the one that leaps to the fore. After all, as Gatorboy says, people are being killed. By stating that those things will be dealt with in good time is simply callous.<br /><br />Dirk, whose posted resume show plenty of work for development projects and politicians, ran to the politicians to tell them of the problems before even meeting with the community face to face (other posters on the board critiqued that!) <br /><br />But as he is a member of Trinity Lutheran Church, (which has flown beneath the radar on that out-of-scale development project and has paid scarce interest with dialogueing with the community about it,) well there is a lot of explaining here, isn&#39;t there?<br /><br />May even explain shyness that some on this board had in meeting with LICA (which turned out to be a useful group after all), which, if I understand their website, seems to be a community group that is trying to give the community a voice in its own future development.<br /><br />I believe the point that Gatorboy raises, &quot;like so many grass roots efforts in the past, be co-opted,&quot; really has to be addressed at the start of your effort.<br /><br />Afterall, the politicians (the very same people who are responsible for this mess) are gay friendly. Party boss Crowley marching in a gay pride parade - come on! You may give an opportunity on a platter to the very people who created this mess.<br /><br />The fact is that the issues that Gatorboy raised are not being addressed gives mute testimony to his position. You are playing into his hands by doing that. Sending private messages to each other off the board doesn&#39;t help, either.<br /><br />I would suggest you squarely respond to his (and others) concerns.<br /><br />

				Gleason, You have many good points but then again I did not see you at the last meeting or planning to attend or contribute to future meetings. As a matter of fact I see no more than commentary (sometimes good sometimes bad) from either of you.<br /><br />As for your comments about private emails, do you feel left out, do you have secret NASA knowledge about who is emailing who?&nbsp; Get over it and do something positive here.<br /><br />Now to address the comments by you both about this community group being co opted by the gay community or started by the gay community of Astoria;&nbsp; I am a heterosexual married man, not politically active (yet) who was offended by joepokeys story of a hate crime in my neighborhood.&nbsp; As you can see from&nbsp; my first post on this issue, I spoke up and people responded (some straight, some gay).&nbsp; At cafe bar the meeting was made up of many friends from astorians.com and many new people from the neighborhood, yes many gay people among them.&nbsp; <br /><br />It was jointly discussed and agreed upon by all sides that since this incident brought us all together it should be the lead point in our first venture into community service. Crime being our first concern.&nbsp; After all a safe community is a good start to build upon.&nbsp; Now if you had been there you could have had a voice but alas you did not and choose to play arm chair quarterback. That is fine but please be helpfull and supportive or go away.<br /><br />I can actually agree with some of your comments about this starting to look like a gay organization but I will repeat that we all agreed at the meeting to make this our focus and this is how we are proceeding.&nbsp; &nbsp;There is no anti white straight bias here.&nbsp; Only a broad cross section of Astoria coming together to stand together and make a difference.&nbsp; What does it matter how it starts?&nbsp; Id say lets see how and what we are accomplishing same time next year.&nbsp; Perhaps by next year we will have faded away or joined LICA or maybe have someone from the group on the community board, who knows but at least we are doing something, taking a stand, making new friends in Astoria and feeling good about ourselves for doing so.&nbsp; <br /><br />I will not address development issues and groups associated with them since I do not know enough about these issues.&nbsp; Must admit that it has not been that much of a concern to me.&nbsp; These crimes have stirred me up and this is what I am passionate about.<br /><br />Once again we invite you to come to a meeting, meet new neighbors and lend yourself to a good and hopefull cause. Would you care to join?

				I&#39;ve been out most of the day, so I apologize for not having spoken up earlier.&nbsp; <br />I must admit, as an out gay man I find this discussion somewhat troubling.&nbsp; <br /><br />No one raised &quot;gay issues&quot; as a top priority for Astoria because they weren&#39;t, and for most Astorians, aren&#39;t.&nbsp; People raised the concept of a community response to hate crimes, the two of which happened to be attacks on gay men (one of whom was also African-American) and together, we have been working as collective group to ensure that these attacks are not ignored or swept under the carpet.&nbsp; The fact that local gay politicians, who once were strongly opposed to equality for gay people have moved isn&#39;t something that has much bearing on this conversation.&nbsp; It&#39;s a positive, but Congressmember Joe Crowley being a grand marshall in the Queens Pride Parade has no connection to anti-gay and anti-black hate crimes in Astoria, he doesn&#39;t even represent the community (Congressmember Carolyn Maloney does).&nbsp; Crowley has been the grand marshall of lots of parades, Sikh parades, Indian parades, various Latino parades - it doesn&#39;t make any of these groups part of the &quot;establishment&quot;, it means we are a voting constituency, and that the elected officials want to reach out to us.&nbsp; That&#39;s politics - on this thread and with SAFE, we&#39;re talking about response to one issue, hate crimes, what happens after the community response to these attacks is still up in the air, though I&#39;ve seen people have some great ideas as to other topics which could be attacked (litter, graffiti, noise, etc.)&nbsp; The fact that people want to make sure that Astorians feel safe and that further hate crimes are not allowed to occur is a good thing and I think we are building a sense of community.&nbsp; I think it&#39;s one of the positive results of bad things - it gets people talking with each other and one can never know enough of ones neighbors.<br /><br />I&#39;m proud of my resume, proud of my local affiliations, political, religious and civic, and feel I&#39;m able to contribute to the discussion.&nbsp; I don&#39;t see talking with local elected officials as a bad thing.&nbsp; They work for their constituents, and we are constituents.&nbsp; I&#39;m not sure how we can make sure these attacks are dealt with, and a sense of safety is restored to Broadway and other areas without working with local elected officials and the NYPD. <br /><br />As to Trinity Lutheran Church, I go to church there, and I&#39;m a lector and a crucifer on occasion.&nbsp; I occasionally run Fellowship after the services.&nbsp; I&#39;m not on the church council and I don&#39;t handle community relations for the church.&nbsp; Again, you can use the fact that I&#39;m part of a church to attack me, but I&#39;m not running the congregation, just a member, so I don&#39;t have any authority to negotiate with anyone on their behalf.&nbsp; I&#39;d suggest talking with the Pastor or the Church Council.&nbsp; I have worked for developers, and I&#39;ve also worked for anti-development elected officials (as Chief of Staff to Councilmember Alan Jay Gerson, probably REBNY&#39;s least favorite Councilmember), so I don&#39;t think I&#39;m so easily categorized, unless one is trying to smear me.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Instead of trying to turn this discussion into one about development, which is isn&#39;t, I would focus on doing something positive about hate crimes, which is what we&#39;ve been focused upon, and I&#39;d lay off the casual swips at the gay community.&nbsp; There are a lot of gay people in Astoria, it&#39;s the gayest neighborhood in Queens, even moreso than Jackson Heights these days, and as anyone who knows gay people can tell you, we never speak with one voice, and we tend to be a very vocal bunch.

				The St. James Deli is at 34-02 34th Avenue.<br />I&#39;d also send letters about their community mindedness to the State Liquor Authority.&nbsp; St. James Deli holds what is called a beer and wine license.&nbsp; Letters should be addressed to:<br />Hon.

				Hey all, <br /><br />I just wanted to add a couple words here. &nbsp;I think the discussion of what happens to our SAFE group next is an excellent topic to discuss but lets try to keep it civil. &nbsp;If we splinter now into factions we will never get legs as a group. &nbsp;We can only do so much at one time. &nbsp;I think Astoria has a lot of issues we can tackle: hate crimes, other assaults, violence, noise pollution, trash, a shrinking police force... &nbsp;And we should be thinking of which ones warrant action and in what order we want to tackle them. &nbsp;I do, however, think that we have been presented with an issue that deserves immediate organizing and action and that is the hate crime(s) that happened. &nbsp;I think the strength of our group to tackle other astorian based issues will depend greatly on our ability to deal with the present. <br /><br />I also think that the recent crime does not just effect the gay community in astoria and NYC but effects all of us. &nbsp;We must unite to send a message. &nbsp;I have a big problem with bat-carry thugs deciding who gets to walk around safely in OUR neighborhood and who doesn&#39;t. &nbsp;and I don&#39;t mean to belittle the issues that face the gays living in the U.S. because they are threatened with prejudice, disenfranchisement from society and violence on a daily basis. &nbsp; This is definitely a community-wide problem and effects us all: Gay, Straight, Bi, Black, White or any of the other many groups that live in our great neighborhood. &nbsp;We must organize to let the thugs in our community know that we will not tolerate violence and hate crimes. &nbsp;Who knows what these people will do next if they realize that Astorians won&#39;t stand up for their community. &nbsp;This is the very basis for the &#39;broken window&#39; theory we were talking about the other night. &nbsp;Right now Astoria has a broken window and it must be fixed before it spreaks. &nbsp;In other words, there is currently a line drawn in the sand and the time to act is now. &nbsp;<br /><br />I think that astoria is one of the best neighborhoods in the country because of the amount of diversity. &nbsp;Queens is the most diverse county in the US and I would argue that Astoria is one of, if not THE, most diverse neighborhoods in Queens. &nbsp;I would hate to see our diversity stifled by the actions of a few.<br /><br />I also have to say that after our first SAFE meeting the other night I was down right proud to be an Astorian. &nbsp;The room was filled with people that saying &quot;this is wrong, lets do something&quot;. &nbsp;Lets not lose sight. &nbsp; <br /><br />Mark<br />

				<strong>Gatorboy</strong>, I&#39;m confused.&nbsp; You imply that no serious debate or discussion is going on here, then when people attempt to engage you, you try to end the argument?&nbsp; I&#39;m not criticizing, I&#39;m just truly confused at what your motivations are and what exactly you&#39;re hoping to accomplish by posting here.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, I find the comment about arts groups to be a little disturbing.&nbsp; I&#39;m sure that you realize that not all gay people are artistically inclined, and that many have their strengths in other areas.&nbsp; That being said, due to our location Astoria is home to many people who make their living in the arts in Manhattan, both gay and straight.&nbsp; I don&#39;t think anyone is under any obligation to come back to the community at night (or early morning... yeah, I&#39;ve been there...) and volunteer their services unpaid to do more of what they already do all day.&nbsp; And at the same time, I don&#39;t think that precludes anyone from having a voice in their community when it comes to something like this.<br /><br />It&#39;s great that we have budding cultural and arts groups, and maybe they can attract some new members out of this, but as long as they remain volunteer groups, they&#39;re just not going to be good outlets for the professionals who live in the community, straight or gay.<br /><br />And that&#39;s okay.&nbsp; Everybody makes the world turn around, and we can still work together to make the streets safer.&nbsp;

				Well SpecialK, I can only relate what one of my clients (who was gay) told me back in the 80s: the gay community was a positive influence on a neighborhood on a number of levels, including cultural etc.<br /><br />Perhaps someone can look that up. But it is a little off topic.<br /><br />My views I aired, and asked Jonathan and Dirk to comment. They did. We differ, but I repect them as they do me. There is little point in belaboring these views. We are not going to change, except possibly over time. But others can still comment. It is a free country.<br /><br />There are a host of issues to be discussed here. Lets give these ideas expressed a time to soak and revisit them in the future.<br /><br />And um sorry, specialK, but you really should look into places like APAC, Socrates, and Astoria Music Society, etc. They are comprised of Manhattan transplants just like you - sans attitute.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				IMHO, what you *all* are forgetting is that Astoria was here before any of us. And *she* has a real heartbeat all her own. <br /><br />If you feel she is in a crisis, then you need to first do some diagnostic workups to determine the cause. <br /><br />Some excellent suggestions have been made to this board. But those with the least experience in dealing with the local, established (political, police, resident, diverse, etc.) machine seem to be wanting to proceed on their own. <br /><br />Who are you trying to attract to *the* cause?<br /><br />Is your way working?<br /><br />How do you feel you will be viewed by the community-at-large?<br /><br />Is that what you want?<br /><br />I&#39;ve lived in Astoria for 62 years. I&#39;ve seen groups come and go. The ones that lasted are the ones who had the *whole* community at heart. They were readily backed by the majority of residents, the local politicians, the *other* activist groups.<br /><br />I was part of a group in the 80s. We had a plan. A defined plan. People were being attacked/robbed/stabbed/shot/killed coming home at night from the trains and buses. Shift workers. The ladies who cleaned the Manhattan office buildings. Cab drivers. The bus drivers. Police personnel. Fire personnel. These punks were free to travel the neighborhood and cause mayhem as long as we allowed them to do so. Our plan was simple. From 9:00 PM to 1:00 AM *we* met every train and every bus that let off passengers in the area surrounded by the perimeters of 21st Street, 36th Avenue, Steinway Street, 20th Avenue. People were escorted home to safety. It took us 3 months before these scum punks were caught in another illegal activity and we gratefully disbanded.<br /><br />So, what is the plan of SAFE? How do you propose it be carried out? How many meetings will need to be held prior to taking some action?<br /><br />What is that old saying about too many cooks?

				that&#39;s interesting, NYCmacuser. I was thinking about a flyer I&#39;ve seen in brooklyn, that offers a free car ride to any woman out late at night who is concerned about getting home safely.<br /><br />I wonder if there&#39;s a way we can help each other be safe without waiting for the police to have a greater presence. Encouraging people to look out their windows and call the police when anything suspicious is going on would be a start. Maybe we can arrange a phone list for people to call when anyone is concerned about walking home but when there&#39;s no threat that is &quot;911-worthy&quot;. <br /><br />I&#39;m just talking off the top of my head. Your point about too many cooks is on point. When you get a few dozen passionate creative intelligent people together there will be more ideas than can be put into place. But I like the idea of having a practical element as well as a political element to our mission.<br /><br />IMO, at some point we will need to select some leaders and let them lead. I think Annie, Dirk and Jonathan have all put a lot into bringing us together and making things happen. <br /><br />Another thought is splitting into smaller groups dedicated to different elements of the project, having a big &quot;everyone&quot; meeting once a month and smaller work-oriented meetings as needed for each group.

				Folks, after much thought and thinking through my feelings and intentions, I would like to suggest something:<br /><br />The whole idea was to focus our disgust and displeasure at the crimes/increase of crime in the neighborhood.&nbsp; It was one attack in particular that brought us together but it is not the defining statement of the group, or at least not my statement.<br /><br />As we can see already there is discourse within our SAFE group.&nbsp; What and how will the community support or reaction be? A minor point but worth noticing here.<br /><br />Perhaps we should have decided to break up into groups in order to attend and investigate the current activist and official groups in Astoria.&nbsp; These groups have been around quite a while and we cannot simply shrug them off.&nbsp; Joining in the voice of the community was our whole point after all and SAFE should think about that.&nbsp; Do not smack the community in the face with our strength and ideals but join them, become part of something and change from within.<br /><br />I propose changing the focus of the group to step back, redo our statement, take into account the statistics already out there on crime and use it in our argument for change.&nbsp; After all there has been crime and quality of life issues here for a long time.&nbsp; One incident brought us together and now we have a choice as to what to do with our new strength and community.&nbsp; I say lets use it to join in and work with others. Promote the wonder and community that is Astoria and our displeasure at what is happening to it.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you agree please say so in this forum, If you disagree please do the same.&nbsp; <br /><br />Once again I am speaking for myself and not trying to act as the leader here.&nbsp; Thank you for your time.

				What&#39;s missing from this current movement is that it&#39;s not looking at the community at as a whole.&nbsp; We have certainly hit a breaking point and a lot have people have come together.&nbsp; But as a group of diverse people with different issues and concerns I can see how some people in this group, or even the communities response to the group, would feel left out.<br /><br />There are many issues that need to be addressed.&nbsp; Some of these things will probably be nearly impossible to change but are certainly worth making the effort.&nbsp; The group, in an ideal setting, would listen to everyones individual concerns about day to day life in the community - here are some of mine, in no preferential order.&nbsp; I would guess that I&#39;m not the only person that feels strongly about these issues...<br /><br />1) Why has the homeless dude with the beard been on the bench near 31st and Ditmars since at LEAST 1998?<br /><br />2) Why are the two homeless guys perpetually panhandling on Broadway?<br /><br />3) Why are local business not protective of their clientele/community?<br /><br />4) Why are we seeing an increase in crime in general?<br /><br />5) Why weren&#39;t the two hate-crimes committed in our neighborhood on the same weekend not publicized?<br /><br />6) Why are there no beat cops on any of the main drags, Thurs night thru early Sunday morning, when all the bad carp seems to happen?<br /><br />7) Why do our neighbors feel that <br />-it would be effective to<br />-they shouldn&#39;t<br />-don&#39;t need to <br />call the police when they see even a petty crime being committed?&nbsp; (If you SEE something, SAY something dammit!)<br /><br />8) Do the local police put all of their eggs in the traffic-cop basket and not ticket when they see someone littering? (I&#39;ve seen this happen)<br /><br />9) I can&#39;t think of any more at the moment and I should be working.<br /><br />There&#39;s a big problem here.&nbsp; Those are just some of my concerns...I&#39;m sure there are some people that have some of the same concerns as well as others.&nbsp; What is also important for me to remember is that if someone else has a concern that is NOT on my list, that doesn&#39;t make it invalid or trivial.<br /><br />As I have said to some of you, I think that we have a lot of momentum - but let&#39;s be democratic and take care of everyone&#39;s concerns.<br /><br />If that means working in smaller groups under the &quot;SAFE&quot; title I&#39;m all for it.&nbsp; Committees are the way to go when there&#39;s a lot to do.&nbsp; So, let&#39;s open this up and let everyone be heard.<br /><br />One last note - it was great to meet all those that showed up at Cafe Bar!!

				I&#39;m glad to see that the discussion is veering back toward productive dialogue and the open-minded generating of ideas without fear of automatic criticism. It seems to me that there are certain people lurking on this discussion board that would like nothing more than to be proved right when our collective cause falls victim to in-fighting and bickering. <br /><br />I applaud Jonathan, enigmacat, photomill and others for giving serious thought not only to the issue of community safety but to the <em>logistics</em> of <span class="bbc_u">how</span> to convey that concern. I am behind them 100%. <br /><br />I propose that we have another meeting soon to clarify everyone&#39;s goals and agendas. At that point we could also identify <strong>smaller working groups</strong>, as Jonathan and photomill mentioned. <br /><br />We all have individual motivations that probably differ from one another (that&#39;s the crux of this <em>diversity</em> we keep touting!) so in order to not self-destruct, we owe it to ourselves to be <span class="bbc_u">totally transparent </span> in ideology as well as deed. <br /><br />This is a highly emotional issue and there are a lot of different people, all with his/her own personal agenda at work for the greater good. Rather than hinder us, these [perhaps opposing] emotions can really provide the fuel for passionate activism. But we have to communicate them so that people don&#39;t feel misled.<br /><br />Besides the obvious anti-violent-crime aspect, what are <em>your </em> personal/political/professional interests in seeking change?<br /><br />What kind of changes (community-wide, group-wide) will constitute &quot;success&quot; in your mind? <br /><br />What do you fear will happen? How do you see avoiding that outcome?<br /><br />How much are you personally willing to compromise on specific language and statements that carry a group label/logo?<br /><br /><br />

				I think the ideas of smaller working groups, identifying goals and reaching out to local community groups are all great.&nbsp; A follow up meeting after the precinct council is a great idea.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />I still have flyers and would like to get them out to people - can we all meet up sometime later tonight so I can give them to folks?&nbsp; I&#39;m going to be back about 10 p.m., maybe a bit earlier.&nbsp; Gay Pride month brings too many events, and I&#39;ve been pulled in a few different directions.&nbsp; Alternatively, I can meet folks in the morning before people head into work if people let me know, or maybe we can make arrangements to have them available for pick-up at Cafe Bar?&nbsp; Let me know what folks think.

				Sounds good to me. When and where shall we meet up? <br /><br />I also wanted to suggest a happy hour on Thursday - but just for the first 5 people who are interested. In my experience, when you get more than about 5 people in a conversation, about 2 people are doing the talking - unless everyone is incredibly disciplined about listening, not conversation hogging, and not interrupting - and everyone very rarely is :) <br /><br />I&#39;m not suggesting a formal meeting, I just want to chat over some ideas in RL with interested folks. &nbsp;If lots of people are interested, there could be two happy hours. Or even three. I think this would make the big meeting more productive.<br /><br />If y&#39;all disagree just say so and I&#39;ll file that one in the round file.

				There is a difference between strategy and tactics.<br /><br />Although I was strongly in favor of a bigger tent to get started, but at this late date it almost seems as if, tacticly, you are best served by the original course of action.<br /><br />The posters are up, the date is late, and the gay community&#39;s (and media&#39;s) attention is focused on Gay Pride Week. Actually, the timing seems excellent, especially if a group gets a little demonstrative at the meeting&nbsp; -- with the press present. &quot;Just see, x years after stonewall, bias is alive and well in Astoria.&quot;<br /><br />Perhaps at the meeting, someone could announce a series of mini-town hall meetings throughout Astoria to take the community&#39;s temperature. People would immediately know it is not a gay-themed organization, and the cameras would be on you as you &#39;get the word out.&#39;<br /><br />Just a suggestion.

				I&#39;d just like to clarify my suggestion about an activism child board.<br />when i suggested it i did not mean for this specific group gathering in response to the hate crime that occured. i meant it in general for those who want a thread about activism in regards to crime, pollution, noise, development etc. this thread is getting bombarded with things totally off the original topic, yet still relevant. if there was a mini board then people interested in activism and getting involved can go straight there and there can be many different threads regarding different concerns. instead of one giant one where everything seems to be getting lost. it&#39;s really getting hard to keep up with this thread in general, let alone remain on point. there are tons of great ideas, questions and plans yet with 8 different pages of really different topics i think all our good intentions will get lost amid the disorganization.<br />(only edited to fix some typos, i probably have more...bad typers of the world uniet!)

				both sound like good ideas to me.&nbsp; &nbsp;I like the idea of dividing up the issues so people can talk about different problems on different threads - I think it would make things a lot easier to follow and reduce people talking past each other.<br />I like the idea of posting local community groups and meetings as well.&nbsp; Aside from LICA, do any of them have webpages?&nbsp; I haven&#39;t found them if they exist, but maybe I&#39;m looking in the wrong places.

				This is indeed the appropriate category to be having those discussions; local politics, activism, etc. I&#39;d welcome people starting different threads to deal with this topic if this single thread feels too crowded dealing with these issues. If there&#39;s a need, we could also discuss the creation of a child board, but this also limits the traffic that sees the threads because they are one layer &quot;deeper&quot; into the forum.<br /><br />One reason this thread is feeling a bit confused is because it is getting a lot of traffic from one of the main categories, by moving it into a child board it may feel more organized, but might lose some momentum as well. I&#39;m not nuking the idea here, just saying that there are some negatives that can come along with separating things into child boards.<br /><br />Overall, I&#39;d say a great start might be for anyone to feel free to start other local community activism related topics in this category and see what kind of traffic those topics draw and then move forward from there.

				Not sure if this is worth starting a separate thread for or not, but...<br /><br />Because I was curious, and because the graffiti around the corner from me has been bothering me, I decided to try calling 311 tonight to see what would happen.<br /><br />I got through within about a minute, and spoke to a gentleman who patiently took down the information.&nbsp; The process took seven and a half minutes.&nbsp; He fumbled for a moment trying to figure out what exactly he was supposed to do with this information (since it wasn&#39;t in progress and I wasn&#39;t the property owner), but he came up with the name of the precinct and the reporting procedure pretty quickly.&nbsp; He said that it would be reported to the 114th Precinct as a quality of life issue, and gave me a confirmation number, apparently there&#39;s a follow-up later on.<br /><br />I&#39;ll be even more curious to see if there&#39;s a response - the problem is with multiple buildings on the block, but it&#39;s just gotten out of control, and I&#39;d love to see it addressed.<br /><br />If I get (or see) a response, I&#39;ll report back...

				With graffiti, I would personally recommend calling Councilmember Vallone, Jr.s office - they have ties to that anti-graffiti van that will come and clean up buildings.&nbsp; I&#39;ve seen them respond very quickly.&nbsp; 311, while great for documenting ongoing problems, and getting them on the radar and to the right agency, isn&#39;t the best way to combat graffiti, at least not from what I&#39;ve seen.&nbsp; Just my two cents worth.

				I posted this awhile back.&nbsp; That cafe was there for years and always got complaints.&nbsp; It took years for it to be closed, and that was because the landlord wanted the space for his bank.&nbsp; I&#39;ve noticed the shoe guy is still there though,&nbsp; I&#39;m happy he survived.&nbsp; In my experience 311 was effective at recording the complaint, and completely ineffective at doing something about it.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Re: The NOISE POLLUTION is back.

				I guess this week&#39;s Tribune let this slip by. Did not see it anywhere else. Again, crime is being under reported:<br /><br />--------------<br />Guests were laughing and enjoying drinks at 3:30 AM at New Grand Buffet at 34-45 48th Street when the celebration took a fatal turn. A group of three men were waiting outside &quot;to get some sort of revenge&quot; said the manager.<br /><br />According to published reports, the victim was stabbed with what may have been a broken bottle, and that cops suspect the assailant might be gang members. <br /><br />&quot;He still had a heart beat when he left here,&#39; said the manger. &quot;Life&#39;s too short, it just goes to fast.&quot;<br />------------<br /><br />The man was an immigrant. Hardly a ripple. Is it not interesting that for a place that so crows the immigrant experience, that in burying this story (and the body) the true feelings by our community&#39;s leadership comes out? <br /><br />I guess since he can no longer be exploited by a landlord or in the workplace no one cares, eh?

				I think it went well - Ann Bruno, the head of the Precinct Council, runs a very tight and very well organized meeting. &nbsp;Councilmembers Peter Vallone, Jr. and Eric Gioia, and Assemblymember Michael Gianaris have put up a reward of $2,000 (and it should be growing) for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the perpetrators of these attacks. &nbsp;The Inspector, Brian McCarthy, and both Assemblymember Mike Gianaris and Councilmember Peter Vallone, Jr. all talked about the attacks, as did Tony Zampella and George Farrugia (the Executive Director of the Gay Officers Action League) both spoke about the attacks. &nbsp;I think we are making a good bit of progress, though much remains to be done.

Ann Bruno is an institution in the community. She is the most dedicated and passionate woman who has ever served this community, with the possible exception of Gloria D&#39;Amico. Hers is a full time job. She attends every meeting she can from whatever organization is having a meeting concerning her beloved Astoria. She spends her days (and nights) fielding telephone calls on any subject that concerns either the precinct council or the community-at-large.<br /><br />If anyone is a really speedy typist, the notes can be taken as spoken directly to a laptop. You would be working with the best-of-the-best in our community. And, for all you young, single gals, you would be meeting some fine eligible Police Officers in their handsome uniforms.&nbsp; &nbsp;:evil:<br /><br />A few telephone numbers to keep handy:<br />114 Precinct: (718) 626-9311<br />• Community Affairs Officer: (718) 626-9327<br />• Detective Squad Room: (718) 626-9334<br />• 114 Precinct Auxiliary Coordinator: (718) 626-9352<br />• Crime Prevention Officer: (718) 626-9324<br />• Domestic Violence Desk: (718) 626-9316<br /><br /><br />

				I&#39;m a little behind on all of this (out of town) but wow, impressive.<br /><br />As a speedy typist, I&#39;ll have to check out the next meeting.&nbsp; I could at least volunteer to sub or alternate typing duties.<br /><br />-j
