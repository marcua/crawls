				<strong>There will be a Q&amp;A session at the Freeze Peach Cafe (http://freezepeach.org) regarding Community Supported Agriculture on Wednesday, August 10, 2005. 3:30pm</strong><br /><br />I am working to start a CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) program in the Ravenswood housing here in Long Island City. A CSA program is a mutually beneficial relationship between a group of people and a farmer in which the CSA members commit to buy a “share” of produce for the season. Then, every week, the farmer delivers his very fresh (usually harvested that morning or the day before) produce to a location in the neighborhood (in our case, 21st St. and 35th Ave.). At our CSA site, the season runs for 20 weeks from July to November, costs $200 for the season for about 6 lbs. of produce a week. The season is pro-rated, as we started last month. &nbsp;We're paired with a farmer out of Long Island who has been growing organically since the 70’s on land that his family has farmed since the 1640’s. Obviously this is a good set-up from a few perspectives-- the farmer is able to stay in business as a small organic farmer with the least amount of hassle and debt, the consumers are able to get a variety of local, organic food inexpensively in a neighborhood that lacks access to great produce, the environment has one more organic, local farm, and we’re all eating more veggies (plus, they taste better!). I’m a huge fan of the program; hence, I’m working for peanuts and the thrill of it. <br /><br />I'd love to hear from anyone who has questions or would like to join. My work number is (718) 609-1028 (ask for Cara) or (646) 284-7762 after 4. Our website is http://www.ravenswoodcsa.org. &nbsp;You don’t live in Astoria or Long Island City? &nbsp;Check out http://www.justfood.org. &nbsp;Thanks!

				I'm relatively certain I'm going to do this -- which means I'll be picking up my veggie box on Tuesdays. &nbsp;If anyone else is interested in the Ditmars area (Matt, Samantha, Rudy, Carse...) and would want me to pick their stuff up as well (or work out a group pick up system), let me know.<br /><br />cheers,<br />jayme

				I'm interested in at least a 50% share. The only thing is that I'd <em>really</em> like to figure out a way that we can get some of this stuff redistributed near 31st and Ditmars. It's a long haul down to LIC to pick up. I'm open to exploring ideas - including having things brought to my apartment (29th and Ditmars), or maybe we can work something out with the Freeze Peach to have local pick up there.<br /><br />I also have one question about the volunteer thing. You have to volunteer 3 hours? That will be hard for me on a Tuesday.

			<dd class="postbody">
				I'm a member of the CSA in Ravenswood. &nbsp;If you have any questions, ANY, give Cara (the lady starting the CSA) a call or an e-mail directly to her. &nbsp;<br /><br />In terms of distributing at the Peach Freeze...<br /><br />1. &nbsp;The only distribution spot we have is in the Ravenswood complex at the Senior Center (BTW, our location happens to be right off of the Q19 bus. &nbsp;The other CSA in the area is at the ARROW community center on 35th Street between 35th Avenue and 36th Avenue. &nbsp;Not so direct of a commute). &nbsp;The farmer is the party responsible for dropping off the veggies to the distribution spot and he only makes one drop. &nbsp; Let's not segregate Astoria/LIC because of a thing like distance. &nbsp;Let's join together in our common love of organic produce! &nbsp;<br /><br />If you and a group of residents in the northern Astoria area can work out an arrangement where someone in your group picks-up on your behalf and takes it to the Freeze you would want to bring up that possibility with Cara and someone at the Freeze. &nbsp;Some members in the group already pick up for other members so I'm sure it won't be a problem. &nbsp;It's also great when neighbors can help each other out! &nbsp;Community involvement IS one of the missions of the CSA.<br /><br />2. &nbsp;Also, you have to worry about transporting the veggies. &nbsp;They are not boxed up for individual members. &nbsp;You, as a member, bring your own carrying devices, such as canvas bags or your ganny cart (reuse, renew and recycle, 'cause it's good for the environment), to pick up the food. &nbsp;That helps keep the price of the veggies down. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />The donating your time issue should be brought up to Cara on an individual basis (since everyone's situation is different) and you may be able to give in other ways. &nbsp;The CSA is run by it's members and with out it's members donating their time (no matter how they volunteer) how would we be able to have <span class="bbc_u">Community Supported Agriculture</span>? &nbsp;Volunteering keeps the prices down. <br /><br />Almost forgot, anyone interested in a 50% share means you have to find someone to go into the share with you, or find out from Cara if she know's of someone who's also interested in a 50% share so she can hook the two of you up. &nbsp;But again, CALL CARA!<br /><br />FELLOW RESIDENTS!!!! &nbsp;Don't post your CSA questions on the forum...Give our CSA coordinator a call! &nbsp;You'll be glad you did!

				Hello AstoriaK. Thanks for your informative post.<br /><br />One reason for people posting questions and ideas in the forum instead of asking Cara is that there are several of us that are wanting to coordinate getting the veggies from across down to Ditmars. It seems more sense for us to find a way to coordinate with each other and share information so that we don't all call Cara and ask the same questions over and over. Especially since she is unable to coordinate delivery in our neighborhood. :)<br /><br />No matter what it looks like we're going to need to figure out how to do this on our own. So for anyone that has ideas on how we can continue to coordinate a more streamlined way for Ditmars Astorians to participate I'd be very interested in any ideas. There must be a way we can do this without every person making separate trips to the veggie stand from such a distance.

				Hello merm,<br /><br />It sounds like you got a good head on your shoulders and doing the right thing by doing the group thing. &nbsp;I understand about it being far. &nbsp;I don't &nbsp;live in that neighborhood either.<br /><br />I just wanted people with questions (like your question about the volunteer hours) about the CSA to give us a call. &nbsp;You never know what kind of info or help you'll get. &nbsp;There may even be an established CSA member who lives in/towards your neighborhood to be of assistance.<br /><br />People like Cara work in partnership with Just Foods to establish CSA all over the city. &nbsp;Perhaps you may even be interested in starting one in your neighborhood? <br /><br />Good luck to the group and hope you get to enjoy your veggies soon!

				I think that most of us on this board are relatively new to the concept of how a CSA works, but all of us are totally on board with locally supported organic foods. I'd love to find a way to pool resources here and pick up over there (so we can support the Ravenswood CSA, but you bring up another good idea as well; if there's a real interest on this side of town maybe it merits looking into how a group starts their own CSA.<br /><br />One of our group has signed up, and we're going to keep thinking/brainstorming about ways to work together to efficiently particpate.

				I'm very interested in this, and would be willing to be part of a group to explore how to coordinate transportation or delivery to the Ditmars area.<br /><br />We belonged to the ARROW CSA a while back, and it was generally a great thing. &nbsp;The produce was fantastic. &nbsp;However, there was no installment plan, it was more expensive, and the one-time fee just wasn't practical for us. &nbsp;We also found that the location, while easily accessible from the train (so frankly, more accessible than Ravenswood for us), was far enough away so as to make coordinating a weekly pickup problematic, especially around our work schedules (my work schedule is more flexible now, so that would be less of a problem). &nbsp;It seems to me that if a group of us can arrange a pick-up rotation, or something similar, it would make it much easier.<br /><br />One question I have that is not answered on the website is how much produce is included in an average weekly share? &nbsp;Is it enough for two people? &nbsp;A family of four? &nbsp;I'd like to get an idea of the quantity.

				This is just a brief summary of the meeting. &nbsp;Contact Cara for more info!!<br /><br />Q: Contents of share 8/9/2005?<br />A: Green leaf lettuce or romaine (1 head); sugar snap peas (1/2lb); 2 green peppers; 1 purple pepper; 3 kirby cucumbers; 1lb squash (choose from 3 kinds - globe, yellow summer, zucchini); beets (1 bunch - 2 choices) -- flower share, 2 bunches of red fuzzy flower (elephant ear?)<br /><br />Q: How to get to share site?<br />A: Take the 19A from Ditmars or 21st Ave to 35th Ave. &nbsp;Share site is 1/2 block away from bus stop. &nbsp;Bus runs frequently but not really on schedule.<br /><br />Q: What are the hours of distribution?<br />A: 2:30-7:30, TUESDAY.<br /><br />Q: If I don't like XX can I switch it for something else?<br />A: There's a swap box so if someone doesn't like something they can exhange it for something in the box (if there is something in the box).<br /><br />Q: Cost? &nbsp;Is there a payment plan?<br />A: Share is pro-rated for the summer. &nbsp;Ask Cara for details. &nbsp;Yes, payment plan is possible.<br /><br />Issues without answers (discussions in progress):<br /><br />- Let's pool our resources and figure out a way to rotate pick up.<br />- Possibility of members with cars making big pick up. &nbsp;We would contribute gas money to offset cost.<br />- Possiblity of share site MOVING next year. &nbsp;Maybe somewhere closer?<br /><br />Not discussed but adding it here:<br /><br />I'm going next Tuesday to pick up so anyone who is interested in signing up, checking out, or just keeping company can come along. &nbsp;Not sure what time I'll go yet.<br /><br />cheers,<br />jayme

				I'll, ah, try to be around Tuesday for the pickup; by then I'll probably have enough money put together for a share.<br /><br />As far as moving the distribution point however, I have to disagree.<br />Even though it would be more &quot;convenient&quot; for us living around Ditmars to have a closer pickup point it kind of overlooks the community outreach aspect of the project. As Cara said, this thing is about more than just vegetables.<br /><br />Just a thought,<br />----zeno.

I ate this concoction with Sriracha, yum.<br /><br />The other way I eat the beans is to sautee many cloves of garlic thinly sliced in olive oil and salt and the beans. &nbsp;I also eat that with Sriracha! &nbsp;I like the spicy. &nbsp;Lightly sauteed beans by themselves with a sprinkling of fleur de sel at the end is also good.<br /><br />I bet you could pickle the beans in rice vinegar. &nbsp;They might also serve well for a cream soup, too.<br /><br />As for the pepper, today I chopped it up and mixed it with the cucumber we got yesterday and I added feta cheese, red onion, and a dressing of olive oil, lemon juice, finely minced pickled jalepenos, and black pepper. &nbsp;Y.U.M. :D

				Well, traditional eggplant parmesan won't help you trying to be vegan, but I make my eggplant parmesan without battering/breading them at all. &nbsp; So if you know a good vegan recipe for eggplant parm, this would work.<br /><br />I sliced them thinly longwise with a mandoline, salted and rinsed them, and then baked them in one layer really slowly (at about 275) for 40 minutes to remove a lot of the moisture. &nbsp;I think one reason people coat them is to try to control the moisture.<br /><br />I then proceeded to construct my eggplant parmesan layers as one would usually do, alternating tomato sauce, eggplant and cheese. &nbsp;It turned out amazing. &nbsp; So I'm sure it would work in a vegan version.<br /><br />Or you could just use the resulting strips as eggplant chips. &nbsp;Jim and I ate a couple, and they were really tasty. &nbsp;One piece tasted unaccountably like a slice of dried apple.<br /><br />(BTW, I did this last night, and the eggplant are still fine.)

				I think slaws taste better made with a mustard-veggie or olive oil combination. &nbsp;More like a marinated salad than a slaw. <br /><br />As for the eggplant, I slice mine up into half-inch disks, sauté them until brown on both sides and a little crispy, transfer to a plate and top it with a slice of mozzarella (or tofu as an alternative), top that with more eggplant and cover with a warm tomato sauce. &nbsp;The eggplant &amp; sauce will slightly melt the mozz. &nbsp;It's kind of like a no bake, no noodle veggie lasagna. &nbsp;<br /><br />Right now I am soooooo not creative with the squash. &nbsp;A couple of nights ago I sauteed some squash with some eggplant and lots of garlic for a side. &nbsp;Perhaps I'll hide some finely diced squash in a homemade salsa for this weekend.

				I have time before my 2pm meeting, so I'm going to dash off a response. &nbsp;The previous messages referenced article states:<br /><br />Eating local(sic) means more for the local economy. &nbsp;According to a study by the New Economics Foundation in London, a dollar spent locally generates twice as much income for the local economy. &nbsp;When businesses are not owned locally, money leaves the community at every transaction. <br /><br />Let's assume I go to grandma Ng's fictional restaurant Asian Fusion and spend $30 on a moderately priced meal. &nbsp;Grandma likes to spend her profits on a nice overseas trip or a cruise playing shuffleboard. &nbsp;How is this keeping money any more local that going to PF Chang where my tips and some of the profits go pay salary &nbsp;to Max and Genie the busboy and hostess who live in the 'hood?<br /><br />Discuss....

				Still not seeing it. &nbsp;Max and Genie still do all those things while working for the chain restaurant. &nbsp;Meanwhile granny Ng is spending the bulk of her earnings out of community because she can afford to travel. &nbsp;My point is that saying that chains selling in one's community take away money seems dubious. &nbsp;I see no hard evidence that money going to a local business person &nbsp;is money spent in community more than the money from the earnings that workers at the chain get paid (not to mention the jobs provided for people who otherwise would never open their own businesses due to lack of knowlege or funding). &nbsp;The article in the link simply makes the statement that these people are spending the money locally based on assumprtion and no specified research. &nbsp;I may have missed, so if someone would point out said research I'd be happy to read it.

				I'm kind of thinking out loud, but:<br /><br />It seems to me there are two different scenarios here. &nbsp;One involves purchasing fresh, local food and preparing it at home. &nbsp;This directly benefits the local, small farmers, and cuts down on transportations costs and pollution. &nbsp;(Aside: &nbsp;I'd like to see a comparison analysis between local non-organic food and distant organic food: &nbsp;which is better for the environment?) &nbsp;<br /><br />The second involves going to a restaurant and buying a prepared meal there. &nbsp;In this scenario, there are two restaurants next door to each other. &nbsp;One is a branch of a national chain. &nbsp;It is owned by a for-profit corporation incorporated in Nevada, and the corporate officers live in California. &nbsp;The staff of the local branch are all locals, and are paid going wages (ie below minimum wage + tips). &nbsp;The second restaurant is locally owned. &nbsp;Its staff are also locals, and are paid similar going wages. &nbsp;<br /><br />Regarding the food - while the local restaurant can and will purchase food that is not necessarily local, there is a strong possibility that the food served by the chain restaurant is centrally organised and purchased. &nbsp;They don't go to local markets at any level to purchase food, regardless of where it is from - it is all shipped in from a central location that is likely not to be local at all. &nbsp;For instance, I doubt that local fast-food restaurant managers go to Hunt's Point to get their produce. <br /><br />In any of the above scenarios, any of the locals could take their money - their wages, their profits, whatever - and spend it elsewhere on trips, shuffleboard, bingo, etc. &nbsp;But <em>some</em> of it is going to remain local. &nbsp;They all live here, including the owner of the local restaurant. &nbsp;Even if they go away at any possible time, they still have to live here. &nbsp;They still have to rent or own a house or apartment nearby. &nbsp;They will buy/rent cars here, go to the drugstore and hardware store here. &nbsp;All of that money will stay in the local community. <br /><br />However, most, if not all, of the profits from the chain restaurant immediately leave the community. &nbsp;Nevada will reap the benefit of corporate fees and taxes, and California will reap the benefit of wealthy landowners who have expensive cars, sends their kids to private school, etc.<br /><br />It's a simplistic example, but I think it's a valid comparison.

However, traditional economic calculations do not account for the true environmental cost of trade. For example, the potentially cataclysmic impacts of climate change mean that the environmental costs of transporting goods long distances are much higher than previously thought.<br /><br />Most food travels hundreds, even thousands, of miles from farm to plate,[1] and the fossil fuel transportation infrastructure we rely on for all this trade emits greenhouse gasses that are contributing to climate change.[2] Climate change is raising sea temperatures and flooding coastal areas, and has the potential to increase crop failures, cause mass extinctions, and spur more destructive weather patterns such as hurricanes—all with profound implications for agriculture and human habitation.[3] Since the full consequences will not be felt for years after the greenhouse gasses have been emitted, it is exceedingly difficult to predict and price future ecological damage and add it to the energy costs of today’s food system. Thus even prices that are adjusted to include current energy subsidies or minor “climate change taxes” are not reliable indicators of the ecological and social price of fossil fuel–driven global trade.<br /><br />Buying local food can make a big difference to the environment. For example, in 1920 Iowa produced a wide variety of fruits and vegetables, but now most of its fruits and vegetables are shipped from elsewhere. If Iowans bought just 10 percent more of their food from within the state, they could collectively save 7.9 million pounds of carbon dioxide emission a year.[4] The Japanese environmental organization Daichi-o-Mamoru Kai (the Association to Preserve the Earth) found that if Japanese families consumed local food instead of imported food, the impact would be equivalent to reducing household energy use by 20 percent; the biggest impact would come from eating tofu products from soy grown in Japan instead of in the US.[5] And researchers in the UK have calculated that purchasing local food has a greater positive impact on the environment than buying organic food that is not local.[6] While some food trade is inevitable, such as tropical products like coffee that are staples in colder climates, a surprising amount of trade is duplicative and ecologically wasteful. For example, Heinz ketchup eaten in California is made with California-grown tomatoes that have been shipped to Canada for processing and returned in bottles. In one year, the port of New York City exported $431,000 worth of California almonds to Italy, and imported $397,000 worth of Italian almonds to the United States.[7] This sort of unnecessary trade mortgages our children’s planet for profits today. <br /><br />1 See Brian Halweil, Eat Here: Reclaiming Homegrown Pleasures in a Global Supermarket (New York: Norton, 2004) for an overview of studies on food miles.

				See lanseaux's post above for reference.<br /><br />It is possible that chains would only bring in solely outside food, but that is entirely dependent upon the kind of supply chain they have. &nbsp;I would suspect that most are made through an arrangement with a Sysco type company which probably does bulk purchases from the cheapest vendor it can find and then handles any shortfalls with local purchases. &nbsp;Even so, the delivery driver for the food distribution and the warehouse workers are still part of the local community. &nbsp;These types of jobs would not be available so the tax base is expanded locally in a way not possible with local only companies. &nbsp;It's merely a shift in the business demographic of the community. &nbsp;Less of one kind of worker more of another. &nbsp;Without seeing some hard numbers based on a rigorously crafted study, I'd say it's six of one half dozen of the other.<br /><br />The chain, using economy of scale, is able to lower the cost and in many instances provide cheaper goods and services. &nbsp;Sticking with food, you'll be able to get more pounds of groceries from a chain than a local market. &nbsp;This means Jack factory worker barely beating minimum has more money to pay other bills. &nbsp;Now those dollars are freed up for him to spend locally on his pint at the pub or slice of pie.<br /><br />I think the organic community needs to focus on the non monetary aspect because that's where the benefits truly lie. &nbsp;Unless someone can develop a megaorganic farm that can lower costs like the big non-organic farms do. &nbsp;Based on my farming knowledge (I had an interest in commercial farming for a long time so I do speak with some knowlege) the organics can't compete in that way. &nbsp;Too much crop is lost to pests and the bulk weight produced is less because it isn't chemically enhanced.<br /><br />Short of government legislation that would level the playing field, organics will always cost more pound per pound and I'm still back to the dubious aspect of more money actually being spent locally with locally grown foods. &nbsp;I'd stick with health benefits, environmental benefits, and quality of taste as the reasoning.<br /><br />But again, if there are some numbers out there someone can point me to, I'd be willing to read and ready to be wowed.<br /><br />see megc's post for reference<br /><br />As for fossil fuels, it sounds good in theory, but I doubt that if people stopped trucking food more than fifty miles the levels of emmissions would go down measurably. &nbsp;I'd suspect that more short hauls would be more polluting. &nbsp;Using purely speculative logic, when your vehicle is driving at highway speeds for long distances, it is doing less polluting than a vehicle that drives around the city with starts and stops all day.<br /><br />I would also supsect that many localities would not have a good variety of fruits and vegetables. &nbsp;Would this impact health as people in places like remote North Dakota and desert communities in Nevada had no access to foods like oranges or rice? &nbsp;Do we make exceptions for them and if we do then how much does this detract from the overall reduction of emmissions we're trying to receive.<br /><br />My problems with statistics that offer stats like &quot;if only we hadn't imported those almonds the emissions would have dropped by ____&quot; is that it is all speculative and assumes that everything happens in a vacuum or that there are no other consequences. &nbsp;These types of studies drive me batty as they are very provacative, but don't really offer us any solutions or alternatives. &nbsp;People in the desert will still eat watermellon and there is no reason they shouldn't. &nbsp;I'm sure there's an environmental consequence for trying to grow rice or watermellons in the desert that isn't emission related but is possibly just as damaging.<br /><br />I think everyone's heart is in the right place, but I don't think the economics backs it up and the studies listed so far are specious at best.<br /><br />__________________________<br />&quot;a tournament, tournament, a tournament of lies. offer me solutions,<br />offer me alternatives and I decline&quot;<br />--REM

				There are also social and cultural implications, beyond money. &nbsp;(to be continued...)<br /><br />Note that most of the below are not related to food business, so they don't really relate to organic vs. non, etc., but generally to local vs. non-local business, which I think is valid to our discussion relating to where the money goes.<br /><br />Study from Maine (http://www.newrules.org/retail/midcoaststudy.pdf) comparing local expenditures of locally-owned business and chain businesses. (Link is PDF)<br /><br />This PDF (http://amiba.net/pdf/inbusiness_9.03.pdf) references a study by a consulting group called Civic Economics (http://www.civiceconomics.com/) that was conducted when a Borders bookstore propsed opening a store in Austin, TX. &nbsp;According to the article, &quot;The firm concluded that every dollar spent at Waterloo or BookPeople generated three times as much local economic activity as a dollar spent at Borders.&quot; &nbsp;On their website, they offer a book called The Civil Economics of Retail (http://www.civiceconomics.com/html/research_book.html) that specifically studies the effects of non-local businesses vs. local businesses.<br /><br />Is local really more expensive? (http://livingeconomies.org/localfirst/faq/) (and other FAQs from The Business Alliance For Local Living Economies (http://livingeconomies.org/)).<br /><br />Short article from BALLE (http://livingeconomies.org/localfirst/whylocalfirst) summarising several studies that have shown that money that is spent at locally-owned business stays more local.<br /><br />Finally, and this may be of little help, plenty of data (http://www.seta.iastate.edu/library.aspx?lmode=1&amp;ltopic=6) from retail trade analysis in Iowa, from Iowa State University. &nbsp;I'm not economist; these links may be off point. &nbsp;But there's lots of stats in there.<br /><br />I'm trying to do more research on this, but have to run for the time being.

(Link is PDF)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />I'll have to tackle these one at a time over time. &nbsp;Too many irons in the fire.<br /><br />I've examined the Maine study, but I can see a couple of flaws in the presumptions of the case.<br />1) &nbsp;Relative percentages are valid in this case.<br />2) &nbsp;Exact amounts equal exact goods and services.<br /><br />1) In this case, I'd say that economies of scale mitigate the effect of charitable giving in that the impact is much more while giving a smaller percent. &nbsp;If you give $100 a year annually to charity, if you get a 10% increase in salary, I'd argue that it is a rare individual who also bumps the giving a corresponding $10. &nbsp;The fact the big box store gives 1k per million of sales is likely to result in a much larger total amount to charity than the eight businesses held up as the local business sample.<br /><br />2) &nbsp;Here is where the equation really breaks down. &nbsp;$100 at a big box gets a lot more than $100 at a more expensive small business. &nbsp;What this means is that I have more money to spend locally when I'm done shopping at the big box store. &nbsp;Even presuming the money spent there goes away at the exact rate listed in the survey, it does nothing to take the savings factor into account. &nbsp;To give a quick example using fresh direct here in the city. &nbsp;Family of four buys 2lbs of salmon filet, 2 bunches of broccoli and a half gallon of milk for a simple dinner. &nbsp;Family 1 buys only organic (simulated the big box vs. small local guy scenario) &nbsp;and family 2 buys farm raised less healthy fish and veggies and skim milk.<br /><br />ALL PRICES LISTED AS OF TODAY<br />cost to family 1 = $23.98 ($11.99/lb) + $7.98 ($3.99/bunch) + $2.99 (the cheapest skim available)<br />$34.95 for a modest healthy meal<br /><br />cost to family 2 = $14.98 (most expensive farm raised available vs. $13.98 for cheapest) + $3.98 ($1.99/bunch w/chemicals for free) + $2.59 &nbsp;(cheapest skim)<br />$21.55<br /><br />A difference of $13.40/day to the family opting for the cheaper products. &nbsp;If both families eat similar meals on a daily basis with similar price differentials (assuming some meals will be more expensive and some will be less expensive but averaging out about the same) for just 15 days out of the month--a full half a month eating out. &nbsp;The extra money for the more frugal family adds up to $201 more dollars to spend. &nbsp;That's a lot more money to be spent locally. &nbsp;Now we could get into the whole what if they go to other chain stores, but then we'd need that character from the television show numbers because this stuff gets extremely complicated very fast which is why most studies are too simplistic to get a handle around it.<br /><br />However, when you are the head of a household in charge of feeding/clothing your family, you will need a lot more arguments than &quot;keep it local&quot; when faced with cold hard reality of how much money you are saving each month at the big box and buying farm raised products instead of organic. &nbsp;I'd suggest targeting the audience and play up the health benefits.<br /><br />Starting to digress from the point, but late and need to go to bed. &nbsp;I'll check the other links you provided as time allows.

				**I will preface this by saying that I don't want to sound high and mighty. &nbsp;I eat all kinds of crap from all corners of the globe. &nbsp;Perhaps I wish I didn't, but I do. &nbsp;Conversations like this are still important, even if I am a bit of a hypocrite, because they get all of us thinking. **<br /><br />I don't usually post here since the conversations seem to move faster than I can type, however, I feel weird not getting into this one. &nbsp;<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: Telesphoros</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> However, when you are the head of a household in charge of feeding/clothing your family, you will need a lot more arguments than &quot;keep it local&quot; when faced with cold hard reality of how much money you are saving each month at the big box and buying farm raised products instead of organic. &nbsp;I'd suggest targeting the audience and play up the health benefits.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />There are a few things going on here... <br /><br />Firstly, one has to be really careful of interchanging &quot;organic&quot; with &quot;local&quot;. &nbsp;I think that both of these things has its merits. &nbsp;Organic food is really important to some people and they would rather buy organic from Australia than low-spray from upstate. &nbsp;I my history in this job and field, I have only once had someone try to argue that organic food isn't more expensive. &nbsp;It simply is. &nbsp;Yes, if you weigh the &quot;hidden costs&quot;, it evens out a bit, but as the one balancing a checkbook for a family, you are lucky if you are able to weigh those things, too. &nbsp;In a grocery store it's very easy to price one next to the other and know that you are paying to have someone pick squash beetles from each and every leaf. &nbsp;(Which doesn't seem like that much more when you think of how much you would want to be paid to do that.) &nbsp;<br /><br />Buying locally means something completely different and isn't always more expensive. &nbsp;However, buying locally isn't as easy as buying organic... unless you shop at Whole Foods or Fresh Direct, you aren't able to know exactly where your food comes from. &nbsp;(And while I don't really know, it doesn't seem like either Fresh Direct or Whole Foods is known for low prices.) Buying locally often means farmers markets or CSA sites.... and while I obviously think that these work, they're not always as easy as stopping by the corner grocery to pick up some broccoli. &nbsp;However, CSA and buying from Farmers Markets aren't always that expensive (with CSA being more affordable). &nbsp;I think that CSA is a remarkable thing because it allows one to fit organic, local foods into their diet without breaking the bank. &nbsp;There should be one in every neighborhood, perhaps especially lower-income neighborhoods with higher rates of chronic illness. &nbsp;<br /><br />When I first became aware of local and sustainable ag it was after hearing about the way that monoculture and the World Bank had affected the Gambia. &nbsp;(The facts on this are a bit foggy in my brain.) &nbsp;The way it boiled down, for centuries the Gambians had been sustainable farmers and then they were forced to raise their GDP and began only growing groundnuts for export. &nbsp;Then they were starving. &nbsp;On a different level, that's exactly what we are doing, only regionally. &nbsp;It seems like a slippery slope. &nbsp;With a fuel crisis, civil war, major catastrophe or the like, we'd be limited to buying from our general area. &nbsp;And by the time that happened, we might have eliminated all of our local small farms and community gardens. &nbsp;(Reference the Cuba's Diet article from April's Harper's.) &nbsp;<br /><br />and yes, people in the desert will eat watermelon. &nbsp;I eat avocado. &nbsp;You probably eat pineapple. &nbsp;And there isn't really any reason that they/we shouldn't, seeing that they/we can. &nbsp;(I'm smirking a bit writing that, though, since there's no reason we shouldn't practice eugenics/map DNA/clone pigs/walk on the moon. &nbsp;I mean, we can, can't we?) &nbsp;For me, this is partly a moral issue and partly about stewardship. &nbsp;If we let our systems get completely out of hand, we then have to live with them, come what may.

				I swear!&nbsp; I swear!&nbsp; We&#39;re working on it.<br /><br />Yesterday we met with our farmer (farmer Bill) from the Green Thumb Farm to confirm and discuss details for the upcoming season.&nbsp; We&#39;re finalizing our membership materials and sign up schedule.<br /><br />More details will be revealed NEXT WEEK but here are a few teasers to tide you over:<br /><br />1) The Hell Gate CSA will distribute from the Freeze Peach Cafe starting in JUNE.<br />2) Organic vegetable shares will consist of 5-6 fresh veggies distributed weekly for 25 weeks (June - November), with a cost per week in the $10 - $11 range.<br />3) This year we will offer a TOMATO, FLOWER, and HONEY share in addition to the regular veggies.<br /><br />Green with envy yet?<br /><br />Just wait until next week when we show you pictures!<br /><br />cheers,<br />jayme<br />
