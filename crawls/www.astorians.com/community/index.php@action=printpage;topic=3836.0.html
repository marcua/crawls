				Brian Lehrer is good, but I make it a point to pledge only during the classical-music programs.&nbsp; For that reason I never make early-bird pledges.&nbsp; The powers that be have got to know that somebody listens to classical music.&nbsp; Over the airwaves.

				For classical there&#39;s also 96.3 (I think), which is the classical station of the NYT. Based on their advertising, their target audience is very old Jewish ladies who live on the Upper East Side. But they do play classical 24/7. And there&#39;s always on-line radio, including Contemporary Classical (http://www.contemporary-classical.com/whats_playing.jsp) which I sometimes listen to at work when I&#39;m looking for some atonal stuff. But I do contribute a little to WNYC, for their talk, not their music...
