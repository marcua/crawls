				...And you have nothing to eat but one dish each from three Astoria restaurants.&nbsp; Which establishments would you choose and what would the dish be?&nbsp; <br /><br />After much deliberation, here are my three:<br /><br />Il Bambino - Bresaola panini <br />Vesta - A Warm Bankie (off the brunch menu) <br />Mundo - The red sonja <br /><br />I could live forever on those three things.&nbsp; Yum.&nbsp; I&#039;m curious about what other people think are the best things.&nbsp; <br /><br />(About the magic island: assume that you have a nutritional supplement and that you would never get any vitamin deficiency illnesses -- so you could potentially choose three different kinds of French fries if you wanted.)

				Excellent exercise. <br /><br />I would choose:<br /><br />* Il Bambino - tomato fresca panini (was going to name another one involving goat cheese but it is gone, sob...)<br />* Burrito w/carnitas from El Rey Del Taco<br />* Sweet Afton&#039;s burger loaded with cheddar and smoked bacon.&nbsp; And a side of those insane beer battered pickles.&nbsp; <br /><br />Totally agree about the Warm Bankie.&nbsp; Love it.&nbsp; Also-rans include: loukoumades from Athens Cafe, a whole wheat everything bagel with lox spread from Brooklyn Bagel, the spicy seafood in curry coconut broth from JJ&#039;s (it&#039;s perfect for a cold day!), the Ottoman dumplings at Mundo, the Cypriot breakfast at Cafe Bar, and skordalia from Zenon (love their baby walnut dessert too!). In its heyday I would have chosen Brick&#039;s tuna tartare. <br /><br />Yep, we&#039;re pretty lucky to have the delicious nosh that we do around here.&nbsp; :-)

				<br />I like this exercise. But cant help but think it will inspire greater weight.<br />It reminds me of when foodista was asked to choose courses from Astoria menus.<br /><br />Sounds like Hikaru has found much magic in Astoria.<br /><br />I like many of the suggestions from favorites like Vesta, MichaelAngelos, Bambino. Seva could make for an island of fire.<br />Have yet alas to try El Grill, but that should change soon. Very soon. Probably not tonight though.<br />Do I go with wishes for everyday or more what I probably would like for every day...<br /><br /><br /><br />I would stick with a <br />wok entree with chicken - <strong>Wave Thai</strong>&nbsp; (Maybe a good choice on the magic island)<br /><br />I want to pick something italian or mexican but instead will go with <br />steak from <strong>El Olivo</strong>&nbsp; (maybe you would find better in Astoria, but this suits me nicely)<br /><br />Where do you go for desserts in Astoria?<br />Will include a fantastic <strong>shake</strong>, either from Bare Burger&nbsp; :mrgreen: or even Petey&#039;s<br /><br />&nbsp;:-P&nbsp; &nbsp;:-P&nbsp; &nbsp;:-P<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I wish the island were more magical so that I could have two lean stomachs allowing 3 more choices ...

				The sweet potato roll at Watawa!<br /><br />Skordalia from Telly&#039;s Taverna!<br /><br />Margarita pie with garlic from Forno Italia!<br /><br />If there was a reliable place to actually purchase galaktoboureko in the neighborhood, that would have made the call--but it seems like you can only get it for free (and in tiny portions) after meals at some of the tavernas, or you can buy a sub-par version at a bakery. Please do correct me if there&#039;s a great place I can pick some up, I love that stuff! <br />

I&#039;ve gotten them there along with the Trigonaki and they&#039;re so yummy. I&#039;m also addicted to their round Tiropita and round spanakopita. They&#039;re so flaky and just sooo good. Ok now I have to get some ASAP!
