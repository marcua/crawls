				7 Biblical Years (http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/27/opinion/27friedman.html)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">As I sat in my seat at the Bird’s Nest, watching thousands of Chinese dancers, drummers, singers and acrobats on stilts perform their magic at the closing ceremony, I couldn’t help but reflect on how China and America have spent the last seven years: China has been preparing for the Olympics; we’ve been preparing for Al Qaeda. They’ve been building better stadiums, subways, airports, roads and parks. And we’ve been building better metal detectors, armored Humvees and pilotless drones.<br /><br />The difference is starting to show. Just compare arriving at La Guardia’s dumpy terminal in New York City and driving through the crumbling infrastructure into Manhattan with arriving at Shanghai’s sleek airport and taking the 220-mile-per-hour magnetic levitation train, which uses electromagnetic propulsion instead of steel wheels and tracks, to get to town in a blink.<br /><br />Then ask yourself: Who is living in the third world country?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />He goes on to say Obama should be making a stronger case for improving infrastructure in the U.S. Interesting.

				As a quasi-regular reader of Friedman, this is pretty typical of the stuff he brings to the table. I think there is certainly a point to this all, as he points out our infrastructure in many places is indeed crumbling. I don&#039;t think using developing countries is necessarily the best example, especially China. It is far easier to go straight to the newest technology when you are working with a blank slate. As an example the phone system in this country started out with copper wiring, as technology changed (to fiber) all of that infrastructure has to be upgraded. In a place like NYC a lot of that is buried beneath streets, buildings etc. Far more expensive to do upgrade that than it is to say run the newest lines to a place that hasn&#039;t been developed yet. On top of that you have to deal with opposition from the public that you wouldn&#039;t really have in China. Watching the olympics on TV it was apparent that the land they used for the Olympic village wasn&#039;t originally vacant. The opposition there has no voice, here people would be protesting in the streets, there would be lawsuits galore etc etc. Then of course there is the issue of funding. Who is going to pay for it? Are they going to raise taxes?<br /><br />I certainly support ideas like this in earnest as I feel steps like this are necessary for protecting the USA from becoming a has-been in the future. There are a lot of shortsighted &quot;penny-wise, pound foolish&quot; people around that might not though.

				You raise some good points. And has Friedman himeself points out, outside of Beijing you can find horrendous poverty - that disparity troubled me.

				The standard of living, while still better than most countries, is still deteriorating right in front of us. If you don&#039;t have money, you&#039;re screwed. College loans get people into severe debt as they don&#039;t necessarily pay for themselves. <br /><br />We&#039;re presented with an &quot;ideal&quot; lifestyle through mainstream media that&#039;s not usually possible to obtain or maintain. We&#039;re expected to use gas, credit cards, eat bad food, and not exercise so that certain people (oil/insurance/pharmaceutical companies) can remain super-wealthy. Our basic rights as Americans are being taken away- Patriot Act- in the name of &quot;national security&quot;.<br /><br />I know this is nutty and simplistic, but it&#039;s my pessimistic viewpoint.
