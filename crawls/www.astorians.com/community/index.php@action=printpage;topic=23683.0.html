				Has anybody in the area tried a computer repair service such as Geek Squad or any independent services?<br /><br /><br />I have a laptop that&#039;s about 8 years old, and a netbook.&nbsp; I&#039;m using the annoying little netbook now because my laptop has many many many issues, some of which are:<br /><br /><br />Overheating due to causes unknown to me.<br /><br /><br />Disappearing hard drive space.&nbsp; I took off a program, deleted old backup points &amp; registry errors, gained over a gig of space and lost it within 3 days.<br /><br /><br />Funmoods in Explorer.&nbsp; I always use Google, but occasionally a link opens automatically in Explorer.&nbsp; The first tab looks fine, the second is Funmoods.<br /><br /><br />Microsoft Security updates that can never be installed, yet never disappear from the icon tray, so it always tells me there are updates to be installed.<br /><br /><br />Possible security conflict.&nbsp; Every time I go to a self-help website they tell me to use a different program.&nbsp; They never tell me which one to give up.<br /><br /><br />Self help websites with snarky mods.&nbsp; They critique misused user terminology, give answers beyond the comprehension level of the asker, and ignore further questions on the same subject because they say the other mod(s) already answered the question.<br /><br /><br />I have an external hard drive with plenty of space on which I store my personal files, but my netbook with starter editions of Windows 7 and Word/Excel 2010 drives me crazy for all the usual starter edition reasons, and the OpenOffice I downloaded so I could have use of a full screen also drives me crazy because, bless their little OpenOffice hearts, it&#039;s NOT just as good as Microsoft.&nbsp; I really need my laptop with its good old fashioned Windows XP and Office 2003.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m mistrustful of computer repair services because once when I took my laptop for servicing I mentioned to the front-desk guy the disappearing hard drive space problem and he pointed to the single biggest program on the laptop and told me to get rid of it.&nbsp; That&#039;s nice, I use that one every day, thanks for the help.&nbsp; Long later I bought the external hard drive and did install it on that and uninstalled it on the laptop and that&#039;s when I had over a gig of suddenly free space that was gone in 3 days.<br /><br /><br />So..... any recommendations for or warnings against computer services in the area?<br /><br /><br />(And, any opinions on, if I can, uninstalling the Microsoft trial versions on the Asus and putting XP and Office 2003 on there?)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I would never trust computer repair people. And with an 8 year old computer, I wouldn&#039;t bother spending any more money on it anyways. If you&#039;re seeing strange issues like overheating and disappearing hard drive space, it probably means the physical hardware is starting to fail. Once you add up the costs of parts and service, it will easily get close to or go beyond the cost of buying a new computer. And at that point, you&#039;ll realize that you spent all this money and you still have an 8 year old computer that might start having other parts fail.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m a Mac guy but I understand that they&#039;re too expensive for some people. Since I haven&#039;t been a student for over 10 years, I personally don&#039;t have a need for a laptop, so I&#039;ve been buying desktops for a while now. Desktops are cheaper to purchase and maintain than laptops. As I mentioned, I&#039;m a Mac guy so I&#039;ve been using a Mac Mini for a while. You can get one for $600 and just get a generic (non-Apple) keyboard, mouse and monitor for about $150 total. This is the cheapest Mac computer you can buy. A Dell desktop will probably run you about $500 with monitor.<br /><br /><br />If you have to get a new laptop, Mac laptops start at around $1000 and bare-bones Windows laptops probably start at $500.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				One of the reasons I have a laptop is that it takes up very little space.&nbsp; And one of the reasons I&#039;m looking into computer repair is that I can&#039;t afford a new computer of any kind.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />I have the netbook because I couldn&#039;t cope with being without a computer for a days the last time the laptop went in for repair.&nbsp; My cell phone has a keyboard, but it drives me crazy to net search and email more than minimally on such a tiny screen.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m pretty sure that aside from the possible need for cooling gel on the (CPU?) my computer doesn&#039;t actually need repair, it needs hard drive cleaning - not physical cleaning, and not hard drive wiping, but a knowledgeable selective deleting.&nbsp; It&#039;s been suggested that I may have many partial installations of updates that failed to fully install, for example, and that&#039;s where the hard drive space goes, and it&#039;s probably overheating now due to conflicting programs attempting to execute at start up.&nbsp; The problem is they&#039;re background programs and I don&#039;t see them listed anywhere.<br /><br /><br />I discovered after I bought the laptop that 8 lbs is not really &quot;portable&quot;, so it&#039;s rarely been out of the house - I don&#039;t think there&#039;re a physical problem, I think it&#039;s all software related.&nbsp; But I don&#039;t know how to resolve these issues and I&#039;m fed up with free help for the reasons I&#039;ve listed.

				I do everything myself. Don&#039;t trust those guys either.<br /><br />Aside from the CPU issue (good luck with that - not much you can do about laptop CPU hardware issues), it does sound like your PC needs a good clean up or better yet, a clean Windows install. That&#039;s what I would really recommend - backup data to external drives or USB sticks, clean install Windows again, restore apps and data. But I understand that&#039;s not always possible. So check out the following apps...<br /><br />CCleaner - good tool to cleanup PC<br />Malware Bytes - scans for spyware/ad serving software<br />Autoruns - shows you all apps that load when your PC boots up<br /><br />Make sure you have current anti-virus and updated definitions. If your AV has expired, uninstall it and download Microsoft Security Essentials (it&#039;s free).<br /><br />As for old updates - if you have Windows XP check c:\windows for a bunch of folders in BLUE. It is safe to delete most of these. If you want to be extra careful - keep the most recent 1-2 months of these, delete the rest.<br />

				Currently my efforts to clean up my hard drive are suspended.&nbsp; My screen suddenly went black and rebooting didn&#039;t solve the issue.&nbsp; All appropriate power lights light up appropriately and my laptop makes the usual sounds, but screen seems to be kaput and I cant find the cable I need to connect the laptop to a tv....<br /><br /><br />So, nobody ever takes their computers for servicing???<br /><br /><br />Back in the good old days when I merely had a full hard drive, I did use CCleaner, I did use Malware Bytes, I did have MSE, and recently a Driver ap clued me into drivers I still had for hardware and software I no longer use.&nbsp; I still have all these things, I just can&#039;t see them now.<br /><br /><br />(I&#039;m using my annoying little netbook to type this.)<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Sounds like a dead laptop.&nbsp; Time to look for a new one.&nbsp; To keep costs down, look at refurbished models.

				Dead laptops don&#039;t have power... and if you buy refurbished aren&#039;t you really buying someone else&#039;s problem?&nbsp; I mean, the original owner didn&#039;t pay to have it refurbished, they bought something new.<br /><br /><br /><em>Nobody </em>else gets their electronics serviced?&nbsp; I just don&#039;t want to take it to the place I went to in the past.

				<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I had a pretty good experience with tekserve a few months back, I know they were affected by storm.&nbsp; I was very happy with my service and technician. <br /><br /><br />http://www.tekserve.com<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				Bumping this thread to see if anyone has any other ideas RE: local computer repair services. I&#039;d really like to have someone do a house call. My desktop PC has blacked out and I&#039;d rather not take it anywhere because it weighs a ton and a half.
