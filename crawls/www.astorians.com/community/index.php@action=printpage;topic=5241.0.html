				The restorative powers of chicken soup are not in the chicken. Take it from an old Jewish lady . . . it comes from the warmth of the broth being spooned to you by your Mama. So, do the next best thing. Order some wonton soup and a pint of rice, put them together and let the goodness warm your stuffy, aching body and the love of your Astorians friends soothe your soul. Feel better.

				8 quart pot, one chicken (pre-cut in parts), one celery thing, four carrots, two onions, two parsnips, salt, pepper, water, generous amount of fresh dill.<br /><br />Clean the chicken thoroughly, put it in the pot, just cover it with water, cover the pot, cook it until the icky stuff rises to the top of the water, scrape the icky stuff off the top with a big spoon, throw it away, continue cooking until you don&#39;t have to scrape icky stuff off any more, then put the vegetables in, cover it all with more water, add the dill and pepper, and a little bit of salt. &nbsp;Cover the pot and cook for two hours or until the chicken starts to fall off the bones and the vegetables are pretty mushy. &nbsp;Meanwhile, cook a lot of noodles. &nbsp;If you can find kloosky noodles, use those.<br /><br />When the noodles are done, drain the water off of them and put some in your bowl. &nbsp;When the soup is done, remove the chicken and vegetables and serve them on the side. &nbsp;Use a ladle to put the soup on top of the noodles and you now have the best chicken soup ever. &nbsp;Go easy on the salt unless you really like salt.<br /><br />That&#39;s the best I remember of my grandmom&#39;s recipe. &nbsp;It&#39;s about 11 years since I made chicken soup so it may all go horribly wrong.<br /><br />

				Had some wonton soup and homemade iced tea from Good One on 24th Ave. Still feeling like crap. Even two Aleve hasn&#39;t put a dent in this headache&nbsp; :-( <br /><br />How long does that recipe take GFB? Seems simple enough.......never mind that I just burned a piece of toast&nbsp; :-P

				This is something that&#39;s been passed down from my mother and I passed it down to my kids, when they got sick I made it for them and it seems to help.<br /><br />1 orange<br />1 lemon<br />1 apple<br />cinnamon<br />honey<br /><br />3 cups of water<br />peel orange (don&#39;t throw away rind) and seperate<br />peel lemon (don&#39;t throw away rind) and seperate<br />peel apple (don&#39;t throw away peel) and seperate<br />add orange, lemon and apple to water<br />add the orange rind (about 1/2 of what you peeled), lemon rind (same about 1/2 of what you peeled) and what you peeled off the apple (about half)<br />let the water boil then let it simmer for about 5 minutes<br />add honey to sweeten and cinnamon<br /><br />It feels great to drink, warm or you can let it cool and drink it that way (I prefer it warm).&nbsp; You&#39;re getting all the natural stuff and the rind is what has mostl the vitamin c in it.<br /><br />It&#39;s old fashion remedy and maybe it&#39;s coincidence but our colds don&#39;t last for over a week.<br /><br />Remember to drink lots of fluids.<br /><br />Feel better<br />

				Having been pretty sick lately I can share with you how I made chicken soup.&nbsp; Turned out pretty well if I do say so myself.&nbsp; Luckily I did this all before really falling ill, mindja.&nbsp; Wouldn&#039;t be attempting all this if I were really down for the count.<br /><br />Went out and bought an organic chicken (Bell and Evans is one brand although I like Murray&#039;s better) and roasted it one Sunday night with some potatoes and onions.&nbsp; Basted it in butter and white wine, salted and peppered it a bit too.&nbsp; Put bouquet garni inside before trussing it.&nbsp; When it was done I let it cool, then picked the meat off the bones and put the bones and giblets in a large stock pot filled all the way to the top with water.&nbsp; Threw in a bay leaf and then some onion.&nbsp; Let that simmer and reduce for a few hours, then strained it and threw out the bones.&nbsp; Kept the broth aside in a bowl for a moment while I sauteed some garlic and lots of diced onion in the stock pot.&nbsp; Poured the broth back into the stock pot, then threw in potatoes, carrots, black rice, and shredded chicken.&nbsp; Salted and peppered to taste.&nbsp; I&#039;m kind of an improv cook and I don&#039;t measure these things out, just do them on intuition, but something along these lines would probably turn out well for anyone trying it at home.&nbsp; <br /><br />I gotta say, there&#039;s nothing like homemade chicken soup.&nbsp; After I ran out I switched to boullion cube-based broth and it tasted a bit blech.&nbsp; Got my Jewish mama to hook me up with some matzoh ball soup yesterday, though!&nbsp; That&#039;s not half bad either folks.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)

				I would strongly vouch for the Chicken Soup, or specifically, the Avgolemono soup at Zenon, on 31st ave. between 34th and 35th streets.&nbsp; It&#039;s probably the closest soup to &quot;homemade&quot; I&#039;ve had in a restaurant and is really zesty and tasty.&nbsp; It&#039;s lemony but not thick, so if you&#039;re a fan of creamy soups you probably won&#039;t like it as much, but it&#039;s definitely quite good.&nbsp; Zenon also delivers to much of Astoria, if I&#039;m not mistaken.<br /><br />I actually also like the Chicken Lemon Orzo soup at Cup Diner and a similar soup at Neptune, but the Zenon variety is the best of the three as far as I&#039;m concerned.

				Ooo, avgolemono soup.&nbsp; That does sound delicious!&nbsp; Nice recommendation.&nbsp; Don&#039;t think I&#039;ve had Zenon&#039;s but everything else I&#039;ve had there has been great.<br /><br />If I lived in Manhattan I would have been tempted to get a big bowl of noodle soup like you can get at Ollie&#039;s.&nbsp; I&#039;m thinking of one that has cracked chicken in it, lots of spinach and yummy vegetables, and a rich broth.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know any place around here that does it quite in that style or quite as well.&nbsp; My friend had a good experience with the hot &amp; sour soup with spinach wonton at JJ&#039;s the other day but that&#039;s a small serving.&nbsp; I had their nabeyaki udon and it was really tasty, though.&nbsp; That might be the closest thing to get around here but it that type of thing doesn&#039;t quite come to mind when I&#039;m thinking of soups to have when I&#039;m sick.&nbsp; Didn&#039;t someone mention egg drop soup too?&nbsp; Not a bad substitution for chicken soup.
