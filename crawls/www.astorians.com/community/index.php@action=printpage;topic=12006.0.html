				Hi,<br /><br />I&#039;m pregnant and my sister and mother are planning my baby shower. I want it to be in a bar or restaurant but I don&#039;t want it too be to expensive for them. I think maybe a brunch buffet would be cheapest?? Any ideas of places to check out? Doesn&#039;t have to be brunch, just an idea...&nbsp; <br /><br />Thank you!!!

				In the LaGuardia Mall, the Italian restaurant, Porto Bello, is not bad. They have a nice room apart from the main restaurant. I saw a wedding reception there a couple of weeks ago. Not sure of the prices. Also, the Chinese buffet has a party room. But I don&#039;t eat there, not a fan of buffets.

				East Moon on Ditmars - no private room but someone wrote in the restaurant section that they had a party of 26 there with no problem.<br /><br />One side note though, they do use MSG in their cooking. We called yesterday and asked as I&#039;m sensitive to it (and got a horrible headache after eating their yummy food there).

				Hiya, congrats!<br /><br />I&#039;d recommend Zenon Taverna- I&#039;m actually getting married there and was shocked at how inexpensive they are.&nbsp; They&#039;re also very friendly &amp; helpful- and the food is amazing.&nbsp; I think they have some pricing on their website- but I can&#039;t vouch for its current-ness.&nbsp;

				Congratulations on your pregnancy!!&nbsp; I have had events (baptisms, communion, birthdays) at Trattoria L&#039;incontro.&nbsp; They have the private room in the back and a semi private room on the side.&nbsp; I have used both.&nbsp; The food is good and the service is great - they are very attentive.&nbsp;

				Try going to Riccardo&#039;s on 21st Street in Astoria -- they have some very good package deals and the service and the food is very good.
