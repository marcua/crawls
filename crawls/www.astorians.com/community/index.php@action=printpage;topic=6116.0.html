				It&#039;s a very easy walk, especially now that they added a new pedestrian ramp on the randall&#039;s island side that descends to the island much sooner than the old walkway.&nbsp; Nice view from the middle of the bridge.&nbsp; Probably a 15 minute walk.&nbsp;

				The steps are alongside the ramp on the Hoyt Ave. North side around 27th St. You can ride along the path, just pay attention to the spray-painted warnings as you approach the steps. Don&#039;t worry, they&#039;re usually in orange and are definitely not subtle (usually they read &quot;STEPS!!!! DISMOUNT!!!!&quot;) <br /><br />There&#039;s a rail set up on the steps where you can position the wheels of the bike and push it up. It&#039;s clumsy but helpful! <br /><br />

				I would have liked it if they widened the pedestrian walk, to allow for easier passing and make it a little bit nicer.&nbsp; Randalls island can be such a great resource to Astoria if they just put a little more effort into making it pedestrian friendly.

				In a couple of years, there&#039;s going to be a big ol&#039; water park there. Be careful what you wish for.....!<br /><br />At the moment, there&#039;s a men&#039;s rehabilitation facility (jail?) and a fun (if seedy) pedestrian bridge across to Manhattan.<br /><br />By riding over the Triboro itself into Manhattan, you can ride across 118th/119th where the bike paths are, over to St. Nicholas Ave. where there&#039;s a very popular bike path. <br /><br />Up St. Nick&#039;s to the Harlem River Greenway (very busy crossing) to Dyckman St., where the new Highbridge bike trails are located. <br /><br />Or, continue past Ft. George Hill and over to Broadway, make a right and ride up to da Bronx where Van Cortlandt Park is. <br /><br />OR, cross over Broadway and make a left....Cloisters are around there somewhere. Continue southwest for the Greenway that takes you (almost) all around NYC.<br /><br />Possibilities are endless&nbsp; :lol:

				Get off Astoria Blvd. at the Neptune Diner side. Walk toward the bridge, just past the car entrance ramp- steps should be easily visible. <br /><br />Great little walk, I think the path from Astoria to Randall&#039;s is like 1-1/2 miles.<br /><br />From Randall&#039;s, there are three choices:<br /><br />- Link to ped path to NYC<br />- Link to ped path to the Bronx<br />- Pedestrian bridge to NYC (96th St. area &amp; river walk.)<br /><br />Those connecting links are tricky to find, and you have to be careful on the road between the paths. Once you do it, though, it&#039;s easy.

				Heff is the real expert! I&#039;m more of a trail biker myself.<br /><br />Any bike shop should have free bike maps of NYC and the five boros. They&#039;re updated annually. It&#039;s basically a road map with recommended bike routes marked according to how bike-friendly they are. <br /><br />You&#039;ll note that many routes used frequently by cyclists aren&#039;t marked as such, so don&#039;t feel limited to the colored lines!

Really good exercise going up, then rewarded with a half mile downhill run. Just make sure your brakes are in good condition, it&#039;s easy to go too fast and lose it. <br /><br />

				A bike ride over the Triboro and around Randall&#039;s Island is really fun and the view of Astoria from the other side of the bridge is fantastic but I&#039;d take care if I was on foot and not riding a bike given that there is: <br /><br />1) a homeless shelter near the 103rd street pedestrain bridge over to Manhattan, and<br />2) gigantic state mental hospital.<br /><br />just my opinion but the atmosphere can be intimidating at times especially since access to the island is limited. It&#039;s one of my regular rides and I really enjoy it but there have been a few creepy instances where I&#039;ve felt as if I&#039;m pedalling through Zombie Island.<br /><br /><br />

				That&#039;s why we need more people walking/biking around Randall&#039;s Island. Take Back The Island! Keep it animated and lively with outdoor activity.<br /><br />While it&#039;s definitely isolated there, I don&#039;t let that deter me. I&#039;m going to miss the quiet solitude when that obnoxious water park goes up.<br /><br />That online map is gorgeous......I was mistaken about some of the streets&nbsp; :| Still don&#039;t know how to get to the Harlem River Greenway from the Triboro path, not that I&#039;ve tried that hard.<br /><br />Wish they had inserts to show the Randall&#039;s Island connections along with the other bridges&#039;.<br /><br />

				I did the walk to Randall&#039;s Island over the Triboro today, and it&#039;s a nice walk - good views, though it was a bit windy.&nbsp; The walkway seems to get a decent number of people, more than I&#039;d been expecting, and most folks seemed friendly.&nbsp; It could be a wider path, especially with folks biking on the passage.&nbsp; <br /><br />I do have a question for the cyclists on the board - what is the protocol when passing a pedestrian on one of these shared passageways?&nbsp; At least 10 bikes passed me and they were all easy to avoid, and they didn&#039;t have to slow down, so there was no problem, except for one guy who came right at me, and had some sort of winged object on his back that if I had not ducked, would have hit me in the face.&nbsp; Is there any standard way to interact with pedestrians?

				It took me maybe 10-12 minutes each way - the view is very nice, but the cars going by right next to you can be a bit disconcerting.&nbsp; I will definitely do the walk again, though I think I like the Brooklyn Bridge walkway a bit better.<br />Does the Hellgate have a pedestrian walk?

				yeah, they looked like they should be on a plane of some sort, but they seemed to be attached to his back.&nbsp; It was really weird, especially since they were at the same level as my head (which they would have taken off) as he zoomed by me.&nbsp; I wondered if it was some new biking thing, though I would think it would slow a person down.

				I just rode my bike around the island again, but took a closer look this time. Found the mini-golf and driving range. I was very excited to see that there&#039;s so much only a few blocks away, but I was also a little angry. What a waste! If the city would throw a few bucks at the place, they could turn it into a REALLY nice getaway spot for city residents. It&#039;s SO easy to get to from Queens or Manhattan, by car or foot. I think people don&#039;t go there because it&#039;s kind of seedy and run down. It would be really easy to clean up and turn it into an amusement park of sorts. Not the roller-coaster kind, but a good place for a family or couple to spend the day. <br />There&#039;s already:<br />- Mini-Golf<br />- Driving Range<br />- Stadium/Football field<br />- Batting Cage<br />- TONS of baseball/soccer fields<br />- Waterfront fishing<br />- Bike/Walking paths<br />If they add:<br />- A large picnic/barbecue/park bench area<br />- Small go-kart track<br />- Large playground<br />- Hiking trail<br />- Amphitheater<br />- Climbing wall<br />- Skate park<br />... and along with the supposed water park, it could be fun for everyone, for the whole day. The revenue would be more than enough.

				Last time I walked to Randall&#039;s Island was too long ago to admit. Let&#039;s just say my friends and I saw a lot of empty &quot;airplane glue&quot; tubes lying around on the walkway. Defintely not a safe place to be in those days. Jumpers were numerous too. As far as the Hellgate Bridge- no walkway. I did (again a loooong time ago) witness a Crazy trying to crawl over the arch one night. He was on all fours-probably high on LSD or mescaline-as was the custom back then. When he got to the highest point he didn&#039;t know what to do, so he crawled backwards to where he started. Everyone enjoyed that. <br />I cringe at the thought of a water park on Randall&#039;s Island, but I heard the plans were scrapped. I don&#039;t think anybody mentioned that there&#039;s a tennis facility there:<br />http://www.sportimetfm.com/facilities2.ihtml?fid=15<br />

				If you go straight when you get off the ramp onto the Island it will take you towards Icahn Stadium and fields to the North, there are also fields to the East.&nbsp; There are a few psychiatric facilities, mainly folks with some mental issues, but also a number of rapists and other sex offenders remaining in custody - they are all behind fences and security though, so I don&#039;t think there is anything about which to worry, unless they escape.&nbsp; While you sometimes feel weird seeing folks behind the fences, I&#039;ve never felt like I was in danger.&nbsp; It&#039;s a really nice walk over - though they&#039;ve changed the walk path on the bridge, so you have to down into a weird metal cage for about 40 feet, and climb on three stair cases (I think it&#039;s only on the Astoria side, not the Island side, but haven&#039;t been able to make myself get through the cage to verify that - the enclosure vibrates and makes it readily apparent how high up you are, which the old path did not).

				Right now, coming off the ramp you head straight into construction. That entire corner of the island is getting ripped up to put in the new water park and a few extra offramps. So you do have to navigate around a few cones to get to the Randall&#039;s Island part. Just Go straight when you come off the ramp, and follow the road about a half mile or so. As soon as you pass the stadium, you&#039;re on the Randall&#039;s side of the island.

				I was trying to find out if the water park is still on or not, and I came across a great site from the Randall&#039;s Island Sports Foundation (http://www.risf.org/index.html) with details about ongoing construction/improvements to Randall&#039;s Island/Wards Island, as well as great maps here (http://www.risf.org/projects2.html) and here (http://www.risf.org/direction2.html).&nbsp; It says that the water park has been cancelled (http://www.risf.org/projects_waterpark2.html), but they are still developing the sports fields and continuing with environmental restoration (http://www.risf.org/projects_env.html) of Little Hell Gate Inlet.

				That&#039;s really too bad. Since the first time I checked out the island, I saw the potential for a great spot for families to hang out on the weekends, with something for everyone. Water park, mini-golf, food, open lawns, etc. An easy ride from four boroughs and a good spot to escape the skyscrapers and noise of the city for a few hours. When I heard that there would be a water park, I thought it would really seal the deal and reveal this hidden secret. Another case of bureaucrats not seeing the big picture, it seems.&nbsp; :-(

				I run over the Triborough a few times a week.&nbsp; As others have said, you get on the bridge at 27th and Hoyt.&nbsp; The construction crews have the temporary staircases in place on both the Queens side and the Randall&#039;s side; if you are biking over, there are those steel rail things to wheel your bike up, but it&#039;s still a push to get the bike up.&nbsp; Once you get off the bridge, you go down the ramp and at the bottom, you will find more construction.&nbsp; The best way to continue is to keep heading north for about a 1/4 mile and you will see a road going to the right (goes to the picnic areas) and the new bike/walk/run path to the left.&nbsp; Going to the right isn&#039;t a fun as it used to be, because it&#039;s all fenced off where you used to go back under the Triborough.&nbsp; If you go left, you can use the b/w/r path to go all the way to the green pedestrian bridge that goes into Manhattan at about 102nd St.&nbsp; They did a nice job on the path; separate paths for bikes and peds with some nice flower beds inbetween.&nbsp; If instead of going right or left, you continue straight, you go past the track stadium, the golf range, and the mini golf.&nbsp; If you make a left after the stadium (between the stadium and the golf) you can follow the road down to the river and go left (which will hook you back into the b/w/r path in about 1/2 mile) or go right which will put you under the Manhattan part of the Triborough.&nbsp; You can go over that span or continue around the north part of Randall&#039;s and go into the softball fields area.&nbsp; You get a nice view of North Brother Island (where the Slocum wound up) and that whole bay area.&nbsp; Keep looping and you will wind up back by the Stadium.&nbsp; If anyone wants the mileages for different sections, I&#039;ll post them.
