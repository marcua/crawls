				This weekend I saw signs that ABC Store on 31st bet 21st and Ditmars will be closing. They don&#039;t say when it will close.&nbsp; I&#039;m really not happy about this at all.&nbsp; This store has everything you could want at great prices.&nbsp; There aren&#039;t any other clothing stores in the area that sell ladies, mens, and childrens wear as well as having things for the house like curtains and bedspreads.&nbsp; I wonder what will be taking its place.&nbsp; I hope not an apartment building

				That is a shame. It appears days are numbered for this type of retail. The real estate is just too valuable for this large department store type establishments. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised to see the phenomenon move over to Steinway St.

I love the area which is why I live here. I do however understand that we are smack dab in the middle of the most populous and desirable place in the country and world. I can guarantee you there were people complaining about when the building/house you live in was built. We need to be smart about growth and that means more housing and dense growth. The alternative is to continue to the 1950s model of sprawl gobbling up green space at the edges of our cities.

				On 31st Street, between Broadway and 31st Avenue, didn&#039;t they construct an apartment building with the Deals store on street level?&nbsp; Deals may be schlocky, but the point is you can have large-space retail operations with low price points and new housing above.&nbsp; Even by the el.&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve asked at Verdi Fresh and there&#039;s no news from them about their lease ending as of a few weeks ago. El Olivo just renovated and a friend of the owner told me that they have no plans to close. So the stores north of ABC might be sticking around.<br /><br /><br />As for Mandee, I wondered the same thing, but I also saw them repairing the sign last week. I don&#039;t think they&#039;d repair the sign right before they closed for good...but who knows.

				I don&#039;t think anything can be constructed over six stories given the new zoning regulations which went into effect several years ago.&nbsp; Even at six stories it would be the same height as the complex across 31st Street.<br /><br /><br />One wrinkle I heard is that the church on 21st Ave is refusing to sell their air rights which could also impact how tall this building can be.<br /><br /><br />In other news, Soho underneath the gym is closing on February 10th.&nbsp; :(

				Well.... A friend who&#039;s an active member of the church and who&#039;s been close to the negotiations has told me that they are in fact transferring some of the air rights (they need the money to stay solvent and do necessary improvements). It sounds like it won&#039;t actually allow them to go much over the height permitted by the zoning laws (75 feet with the transfer, I think?). I believe that this sort of transfer is also &quot;as of right,&quot; which means that it does not require approval of the Community Board (based on a conversation I had with a CB member).<br /><br /><br />(I&#039;m personally very much in favor of development on that site, but glad that it won&#039;t be out of scale with other buildings in the vicinity.)<br /><br /><br />So far as I know the buildings north of ABC are not losing their leases, though I guess that could change any day.

				Yup, the toy/luggage store is definitely closing. Everything is 20% off right now.<br /><br /><br />An update from my friend at Grace Lutheran - the Attorney General&#039;s office has stalled the air rights transfer, but it sounds like that&#039;s just a technicality and it&#039;s going to go through. It sounds like this is a big, long project - they have a 15-year timeframe for the entire thing. So it may be that the ABC-to-library project will be the first phase and the buildings north of ABC will be a second phase, since they still have several years left on their leases.

				I don&#039;t think the library is going anywhere. And I don&#039;t think that Mandee&#039;s getting demolished, either - saw workers bringing fresh drywall into the building a couple of days ago, so I think they&#039;re renovating. From what I glimpsed, I think I saw some new interior walls, so maybe they&#039;re subdividing the space?

				Was shocked and saddened to discover that Wave Thai lost their lease and have closed. They don&#039;t have plans to reopen, at least not any time soon. That&#039;s a major loss, to me.

				The rumor was that all of those stores from the library down would be closing so I&#039;m not surprised, but I&#039;m not happy about it

				Thank you! That&#039;s the most concrete information I&#039;ve seen about the project. I&#039;m pleased to see that these guys seem slightly less shady than some local developers - they did the Astoria Lights project, about which I&#039;ve heard nothing but glowing reviews.<br /><br /><br />I am sad to see that the footprint includes Verdi Fresh. Though the highlighted properties on the map are also inaccurate, since they don&#039;t include Wave Thai/defunct Cuban coffee shop/toy store.

I&#039;m in the real estate industry so I don&#039;t trust the rumor mill about things like this until I see/hear something from a reputable source.<br /><br /><br />The diagram in the article was probably done by the reporter or someone on their staff rather than the developer so I wouldn&#039;t 100% trust its accuracy. I just did a bit of research on city websites, all the buildings north of the library look like they&#039;re owned by related companies even though they&#039;re under different LLCs, so I have to believe they&#039;re all part of the development. It also looks like they were working on putting together this assemblage for some time.

				In case any one missed it, ABC Store has been resurrected as &quot;ABC Deals&quot; in the old Mandee&#039;s space (I think), closer to Ditmars.
