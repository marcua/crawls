				Correct, Dennis does not roast his own coffee.&nbsp; He buys from small roasters around the country that take care of the roasting.&nbsp; The batch that I picked up this Saturday I believe was from Ithaca, NY and was roasted a week ago which is great.<br /><br />I&#039;ve only been there on Saturday afternoons and its been pretty empty. I could see how it could easily be filled up by the laptop crowd as the place is pretty small.<br />

At the very basic level, camping out at a cafe for the day is rude and selfish. I, too, wish businesses would impose time limits. I like how Sweetleaf does it - no plugs, so however long your battery lasts is as long as you get to stay on your laptop. A very sensible compromise.

				I have become someone who does work in a coffee shop at times. For me, when I need to do some creative work, it&#039;s a great environment. Owning my own business, I do some work at home, some in a coffee shop, and some at Queens Collective. I change it up.<br /><br /><br />If someone is a paying customer, what do you care what they do? I don&#039;t know anyone that finishes their coffee and then sits there for hours anyway. When my cup is empty I buy another. I tip well. I buy snacks and food, too. <br /><br /><br />Occupying long term...I get that, and I think that the &quot;no outlets&quot; thing is a pretty fair compromise. I just with Kinship had a bathroom!

				I just don&#039;t get it and it may be generational and I&#039;m the one not getting the culture of this.&nbsp; It would never dawn on me to use a restaurant or café as my office.&nbsp; In fact, I usually work at home until I&#039;m numb and then run out to these shops for a break from looking at the screen...only to find every seat occupied by people looking into screens.&nbsp; I thoroughly enjoyed the Bagel Factory the other day.&nbsp; They&#039;re totally old school.&nbsp; I sat, ate, chatted with the staff, and watched the people come and go.&nbsp; I guess if I keep that up I&#039;ll be kicked out for being a weirdo.&nbsp; Philo-Junius seems to be conscious of his space and what he gives back to the business.&nbsp; Frankly, that doesn&#039;t seem like the norm to me.

				As an information professional, it&#039;s a shame to me that our huge and resourceful Queens Public Library system didn&#039;t capitalize on this trend.&nbsp; Local branches could partner with local coffee and bake shops to have onsite outposts within a suitable part of the library space.&nbsp; There would be the wifi, the coffee, ample seating and table space, plus the advantage of an impressive print collection, and the expertise of professional librarians.&nbsp; There would not be funky music, interesting art, and colorful hipsters roaming about --- perhaps.&nbsp; Also the fact that branch locations are not convenient for everyone.&nbsp; Still, it&#039;s a natural fit and offers more to the patron overall.

				+1 on the library idea. Great concept.<br /><br /><br />As someone who is also self-employed, I also like to switch it up as Philo-Junius does. I work from home some of the time, but too much of that gets claustrophobic and isolating. I also work at Create NY Space, a great coworking space in the neighborhood, and some times I like to drop by a coffee shop for a different vibe. Part of the reason I go is that I actually *want* to be more social.<br /><br /><br />The folks from Astoria Coffee are good friends of mine and I think their coffee shop is a wonderful place to stop by to get a bit of work done or, if you&#039;re feeling social, just pull up a stool at the bar and make a new friend. Late in the day is a good time for doing that--the vibe there is pretty relaxed around 5 or 6 and they usually have some nice classical music or jazz playing. <br /><br /><br />I&#039;m a little surprised by the hostility to us laptop people. Although I&#039;ve seen the &#039;campers&#039; out in force and think that&#039;s a horribly selfish and antisocial way to approach things, plenty of us are just trying to be productive and social. I often go out to coffee shops to write by hand in a journal and somehow I suspect that would never be called out as antisocial or rude. Not sure how writing on a laptop is different. I also think the plug compromise is a good one. <br /><br /><br />I think each coffee shop has a right to set its own rules about WiFi use. After all, they&#039;re the ones who will be financially impacted the most by the folks who think it&#039;s somehow all right to ask for a bottomless cup of coffee and stay there all day. It also depends on what kind of atmosphere and community the shop owners want to create. That&#039;s up to them. If I&#039;m right, Queens Kickshaw now shuts their WiFi off at noon. Other places have different policies. I remember being asked not to use my laptop in a coffee shop in Manhattan since that was their policy, and I thought that was perfectly fine. Clearly they were going for a different vibe, and that&#039;s their prerogative.<br /><br /><br />If you&#039;re looking for something less laptop-oriented, there are certainly places you can go in the neighborhood. When I want a different vibe, I sometimes drop by Cafe Omonia. Great people-watching, not a place I would really feel it would be appropriate to bring a laptop, and that&#039;s perfectly fine.
