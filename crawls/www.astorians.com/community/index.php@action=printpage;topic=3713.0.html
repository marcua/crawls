				Ok,<br /><br />I have a question for all my fellow Astoria residents.<br /><br />What if a fellow Astoria resident , who wanted to do something artistic .<br /><br />And say you agreed , for a price to provide services. Manpower, space , effort ....<br /><br />If that person, ( even if they are one of the &quot;Astorians&quot; ) didn&#39;t&nbsp; pay as agreed, and didn&#39;t even <br />bother to call or tell you anything, unless you chased them.... Even though you provided everything you agreed to...<br /><br />What would you fellow Astorians think,<br /><br />If it was your money , or your time , that was used and never <br />compensated, what would you do.....??<br /><br />Given the fact that you agreed....signed an agreement ...<br /><br />what would YOU do.. ???<br /><br />The person with the best answer gets the name of the Astorian , unless of course you all want to know who not to trust ......<br /><br />He likes to think he&#39;s one of you ..... is he ????<br /><br /><br />

				I think that depends.<br /><br />If you&#39;re going to identify someone by their full name and post something defamatory about someone here publicly then our forum rules state that you need the person&#39;s concent first.<br /><br />You would be welcome to post your story here without invading someone&#39;s individual privacy (business would be okay). If you want to get down to the nasty details, or out someone I personally feel the best place to do that would be a blog.

				The only thing you need to worry about legally in a libel/slander case is to just make sure that whatever you are saying is true. The very definition of libel is saying something that you know to be false about someone that causes them hardship. If someone scams you, and you know it&#39;s true, then they can hardly sue you for libel.<br /><br />If you genuinely feel that the community should know something that has happened to you, then by all means share it. You can do so without invading the privacy of someone else in our community, but can help educate people on what to do to avoid getting taken advantage of someone who tries to do something similar in the future.<br /><br />But I think the general feeling here is that this board isn&#39;t a place to just wage war on someone personally. If you want to do that it&#39;s better to do it on your own turf rather than anyone else&#39;s (like this board for example). Which is why I suggested a blog as a good place to do that sort of thing.<br /><br />If the community is really threatened by something this person does/did, then it might be good to share it. But if you just were to post a personal attack aimed at an individual on this board (&quot;expose&quot; them), that might not go over so well.<br /><br />It all just depends on how you handle it I think.<br /><br />No matter what I hope you&#39;ll stick around and join some of the other threads as well.

				If there&#39;s a signed agreement, then it&#39;s something you could either take to court or settle through mediation...<br />If it&#39;s something that you know is habitual, then you can turn to media like &quot;shame on you&quot;<br />But to out someone on astorians does feel like slander and gossip as suggested by everyone else.<br />

				What a weird thread. There are some conflicting things being said here. Just Me knows he/she is telling the truth. So by merm&#39;s definition it&#39;s not slander. Others have mentioned that word would get around if the &quot;mofo&quot; really is misbehaving somehow. But I think that&#39;s what Just Me&#39;s intent was--to make sure word gets around. But then everyone&#39;s acting really nervous about the idea of it actually happening on this site. So is it okay if word gets around to everywhere but here?<br /><br />It all seems like mixed messages to me. I get that everyone wants to be supportive, and that&#39;s great. But it doesn&#39;t help when your intentions seem to be all over the place. (Feel free to tell me if I&#39;m just missing something.) Why don&#39;t people just say, &quot;No smack-talking about anyone ever on astorians.com&quot; or &quot;Don&#39;t hurt anyone&#39;s feelings&quot;? At least then it&#39;s clear. In some cases, it&#39;s not enough to say that the first rule of this site is to be neighborly. Just Me thought &quot;neighborly&quot; meant to try to save other people the same aggravation that he/she went through.<br /><br />I know I&#39;m going to regret posting this. But my cable&#39;s out, so I have nothing better to do.

				I think what people might be expressing is that there&#39;s a difference between advising the community of some threat (scammer, or other threat), and just seeking revenge. I don&#39;t think people would mind at all if Just Me posted something that was done out of community service, but I think where people might have a problem is if someone used the board just to get &quot;revenge&quot;. That kind of writing is best left to something more personal like a blog. Here&#39;s an example (http://www.astorians.com/index.php?topic=3714.0) of an anonymous posting about something negative and potentially dangerous.<br /><br />So, it&#39;s okay to post &quot;negative&quot; things, and even &quot;out&quot; a scam (as has been done many times on this board), but people won&#39;t respond well to people that are just airing their dirty laundry.<br /><br />That&#39;s my take on it anyway. As for board policy - as long as someone&#39;s individual identity isn&#39;t compromised it&#39;s okay to post things that one thinks might be helpful for the community (and general public) who reads this board.

It became crystal clear, however, when they posted to <span class="bbc_u">here</span> (http://www.astorians.com/index.php?topic=1839.msg11752#msg11752) and sorta did their own outing. But as I know that not *all* people read *all* the postings on this board (or any other) I prudently kept quiet. It seemed to me that in the &quot;What Astorians Think&quot; thread people were sorta deciding whether this was the proper forum for such a discussion. Even when you said:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=3713.msg36511#msg36511">Quote from: merm on October 06, 2006, 04:08:32 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">If you&#39;re going to identify someone by their full name and post something defamatory about someone here publicly then our forum rules state that you need the person&#39;s consent first.<br /><br />You would be welcome to post your story here without invading someone&#39;s individual privacy (business would be okay). If you want to get down to the nasty details, or out someone I personally feel the best place to do that would be a blog.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>It seemed to me that you were encouraging further discussion, rather than having someone use this board as a resource for their personal (albeit legal) problems. I kept my secret and hoped that the posters to this thread would come to a mutually satisfying conclusion about whether the original poster had used the proper forum for this problem. <br /><br />What you saw as secrecy (and labled as immature) I saw as discretionary prudence. They were trying to make a full-blown legal action unnecessary by letting the alleged offender be aware that there were other forums besides a courtroom that could do them harm. Most mediators would have applauded this tactic. Anything to keep from having to burden the already overcrowded Civil Court calendars.<br /><br />I am really sorry that you were offended by the term outing. But, you put your 2 + 2 together and told everyone that you knew the whole scoop—and then you shared the details. As you might be aware, there are many transactions where payment up-front is *never* <em>de rigeur</em> and is seriously frowned upon. Do you know if this was one of them? I don&#39;t. I also still haven&#39;t come to terms with whether or not any of the details of this problem should have been bantered about on a Community board as opposed to a private blog. It <del>can</del> <del>could</del> might lead to additional litigation; counterclaim.<br /><br />And, <strong>merm</strong>, I sorta summed up my own feelings on the subject in my final line. Showing my boredom, I simply changed the subject and said, &quot;Wasn&#39;t the weather today absolutely beautiful?&quot; Errr, ummm, how come you chose *not* to further the OT discussion on today&#39;s beautiful weather?

				If I take the two threads (this one and the starbucks comment) together with JustMe&#39;s private blog, it really does feel like JustMe was slandering a member of this board who, upon reviewing past posts, does appear to have ties to the astorians community. That said, the business-related dispute&nbsp; between JustMe and what appears to be&nbsp; NickNSakai really should be settled between them. More to the point, the original post seemed like it accussed Astorians of hiding and harboring when we&#39;re a much larger community than we used to be and not everyone knows the parties involved.<br />I hope both parties get this resolved soon, off and away from astorians

I was going to say something in this thread earlier, but the whole thing seemed so bizarre and sort of creepy to me that I didn&#39;t. I actually had a whole post written yesterday, and I never posted it because, this being the internet and all, I was a *little* concerned for my personal safety. See, between what I write here and the fact that my Myspace page is posted as my URL here, someone could easily find me. (Like, you could easily figure out that I&#39;ll be at the Irish Rover tonight with my other Libras, and go to my Myspace page, and there&#39;s my picture!) And then I was going to write something about how &quot;Just Me&quot; is being, basically, a dork and if he/she wants to out someone for being a bad businessperson, then grow a set and spit it out. But, for all I know, &quot;Just Me&quot; might be nutso crazy, and the tone of his/her posts didn&#39;t really push me in a direction to believe that they weren&#39;t. So I didn&#39;t say anything.<br /><br />Just Me, if someone screwed you, just say it. If you don&#39;t want to say it yourself, then don&#39;t force other people to figure it out and post it for you. Posting cryptic puzzle-like messages for other people to figure out is lame and cowardly.<br /><br />This whole thread just reeks of corny junior high gossip drama and honestly? I&#39;m surprised that I&#39;m bothering to post in it at all.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=3713.msg36719.html#msg36719">Quote from: mirki2 on October 08, 2006, 07:57:16 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I hope both parties get this resolved soon, off and away from astorians<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Word.

If this person was a regular contributer it would be one thing (like the fact that everyone else here talks about good and bad things that happen to them in our neighborhood all the time), but when someone&#39;s first post under a new name is to threaten someone while the rest of us scratch our heads it&#39;s a bit suspect IMHO (especially so for those of us that have been around for a while and know the person has had three accounts and doesn&#39;t have many positive things (http://waltz-astoria.blogspot.com/2006/09/just-give-me-truth-all-i-want-is-truth.html) to say about local online boards exactly like ours.)<br /><br />It&#39;s not against the rules what Just Me did (all this information is public already), and so once I figured it out I just posted it hoping the conversation might become more intelligible.

				Apparently unless you are really in the know here, most of us know nothing.&nbsp; I don&#39;t get what is going on.<br /><br />Did just me work on a shoot for nick at waltz?&nbsp; Did Nick crew crew/talent and Waltz out of money?&nbsp; Just me looks upset and so does Bill at Waltz.&nbsp; I didn&#39;t know Just me was an esteemed member here and haven&#39;t seen nick post in ages.

Many persons took the stance that <br />this should be a legal issue better left to the courts. I however agree with Macuser...the courts are full of issues we Taxpayers foot the bill for that could have been settled in other ways.<br /><br />I did not post any links, I answered him on a personal e-mail here , I also took one of his old posts and <br />replied, asking how would he feel if we made a movie out of his antics..I did not link it to this thread.<br />The Administrator of the rules did.<br /><br />I came to the Community Board, I played by the rules ( I didn&#39;t create the rules ) <br /><br />I will say that I&#39;m sorry it seemed to upset so many , you can imagine how upsetting it is to <br />our place, the staff who weren&#39;t paid ( I paid them anyway since it was my mistake for taking his word ) <br />the crew who wasn&#39;t paid and a few others I&#39;m hearing from.<br /><br />One of the members of our community warned me , when I first agreed to the project. I took it with a grain of salt.Now in retrospect I wish I had taken his word...<br /><br />Since all this, he has come forward and paid a portion of his bill.<br />( something is better than nothing ) ...&nbsp; He claims he didn&#39;t want all this trouble and he <br />would like me to stop the legal proccess as well as the postings.<br />He only came forward due to all this....................................So, despite it all , it worked..<br /><br />What he owes other people is still an issue, and he has to reach out to them .<br /><br />The group has asked me if they could meet up and join forces in pressuring him to pay up.<br />I intend to get some further legal advice for all this.<br /><br />The unfortunate part is , myself, my business and the persons who got screwed thus far end up looking like <br />the bad guys.. ( the price I pay , is how you all feel about me and my method here ...I&#39;ll pay it again if I have to ) <br /><br />Like one or two of the members noted, its time to move on.<br />We intend to follow this through until everyone is compensated.<br /><br />I want to thank you all for your help .....<br /><br />Love &amp; Peace<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
