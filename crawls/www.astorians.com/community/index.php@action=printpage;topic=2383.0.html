				The first one I Stumbled Upon, the two middle ones I found on YouTube, and the final one I had seen a few weeks ago, and hunted it down again. Obviously I like cats, especially weird and entertaining ones. Kinda like my own I guess. :)

				Wow, that first kitty video reminded me of my cat Briscoe who, back when I lived in CA and had an animated shark-swimming screen saver, would love to get on my desk and try to catch the sharks.&nbsp; He&#39;s not even a kitten!&nbsp; It was the funniest thing to see.&nbsp; He would even try looking around the back of the screen when sharks would swim out of the picture.&nbsp; He sat there for ages playing with sharks, and sometimes he&#39;d move the mouse, which of course brings back the desktop.&nbsp; Then he would just sit until the screensaver came back on.&nbsp; Ah, so cute!<br /><br />Thanks wasabisam!

				Cats are very intelligent.&nbsp; Maybe it&#39;s to do with spatial perception, which would aid in hunting.&nbsp; Briscoe is also an avid mice and lizard catcher, much to my chagrin.&nbsp; But he&#39;s not a total genius. Apparently he&#39;s having a really hard time figuring out how to push open the new screen door with his face.&nbsp; The other cat, Jack, seems to be fine with it.&nbsp; It doesn&#39;t even latch!&nbsp; It&#39;s a weak magnet!&nbsp; Who knows?<br /><br />See what you started, wasabisam?&nbsp; You got me yammering about my kitties!&nbsp; &nbsp;:-D

				I know that some of you don&#39;t like this, but I really HAVE to share! :)<br /><br />Looks kind of like my cat when I give him a bath - except we actually give him a bath in the tub. Methinks that the alternative would be more messy.<br /><br />http://files.kavefish.com/pictures/collections/cat_bath/_index-list.html

				Oh I just watched a very funny Japanese (I think!) video about cats carrying fish. <br /><br />http://www.ifilm.com/ifilmdetail/2748778<br /><br />It is a competition of sorts to see which cat can carry the most weight. Very entertaining! :)<br /><br />Also as an FYI - it is about 10 minutes long.

				Despite not knowing Japanese I admit that I enjoy the commentary because you can almost guess what they&#39;re saying. I also loved the instant replays. Too funny! And yes - very cute!

				The instant replays were very cute.&nbsp; I did find myself wondering why the cats always carried the fish back into the woods instead of just eating it there.&nbsp; I&#39;d love to know the back story!

				And here is another one I just saw. It is just over 22 minutes long, so brace yourselves, but still worth it.<br /><br />The Private Life of a Cat (http://www.jonhs.com/freemovies/private_life_of_a_cat.htm), a 1944 silent film
