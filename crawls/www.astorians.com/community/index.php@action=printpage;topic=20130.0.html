				(http://www.galacticroundtable.com/page/becoming-sovereign)<br /><br />Becoming Sovereign~ <br />All over the World all Governments are ruled by what is called “Civil Law”. Civil Law, which in all Countries, is called “The Law of the Land”. <br />This goes back to when the Holy Roman Empire became the Holy Roman Vatican. <br /><br />The Planetary Imperialists and they have been ruling all of us through “church” and “state”. <br />There is a second law which rules all of the Earth that is called UCC ~Uniform Commercial Code. <br />That is the law of ALL in BUSINESS. If you have a business in any Country in the World, you are operating on this Planet under something called UCC. <br /><br />Under Caesar of Rome they established that all Nations in the Empire do business under world wide rule all over the Planet is called Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). <br />Uniform Commercial Code is based directly on Vatican Code of Canon Law. Consequently, when a Ship pulls into Port, the Ship is put in its berth. Maritime UCC Rules the Seas. <br />Every Captain of a Ship must present a Certificate of Manifest to the Port Authorities. They check the value of the Goods on the Ship. <br />When you are born you come out of your Mother’s Water. <br /><br />Therefore you must have a Birth Certificate. A manifest Certificate because you are a corporation owned item. You are a human resource,<br />commonly known as a slave. No matter what your complexion, until you understand the laws, symbols and embloms, you are not FREE. <br /><br />Your Birth Certificate is a Security on the Stock Exchange at 55 Water Street, NYC, USA. Order your Birth Certificate and on the bottom it says <br />THIS WAS PRINTED ON SECURITY PAPERS~DO NOT ACCEPT UNLESS ON FULL COLOR SECURITY PAPER. There is a series of red numbers <br />printed on your Birth Certificate. Those numbers are a Securities Stock Exchange number on the World Stock Exchange. <br />You may take your Birth Certificate number and find YOU.&nbsp; Your Birth Certificate is a Stock in America. You are worth money to the<br />International Bank that BOUGHT YOU in 1932. As long as you are not Sovereign, you are a bought and paid for slave. <br /><br />You are traded at 55 Water Street, NYC, in the corporation of the united States of America. <br /><br />Barack and Michelle Obama declared their Nationality Washitaw in 1997. They removed themselves from the Bar (British Accredited Registry). <br />They are no longer Attorneys. They resigned their BAR to give it back to us, they will lead us into becoming The American Republic, lawfully and peaceably. <br />We Will Have a Planetary Government of PEACE and it will be lead by the TRUE Royalty in England, Egypt, and Jordan, the Moabite People, <br />with all the Indigenous and Aboriginal Peoples as well.<br /><br />As we understand the Laws, we realize we must declare our Nationality. The Birth Certificates (Bonds), issued by the States, are Collateral Instruments (Mortgages), <br />and are a deceptive method, that places the Children in bondage. Child service agencies are able to chattel the children at will. <br />This ends as you include your Children on the UCC1 filing and the Aboriginal Moabite Nation Registration Form Affidavit. <br />As we Declare our Nationality we remove ourselves from the Public ‘believed Government’ and put ourselves into the Private. <br />We remove ourselves from the Jurisdiction of the ‘believed Government’. When your UCC Form is filed on the National Registry <br />at the County at Large, considered under the Republic you remove yourself from the Jurisdiction of the corporation called the united States of America. <br />By declaring your nationality, and that of your children, they are no longer wards of the&nbsp; supposed &#039;State&#039;, they cannot be stolen from your home <br />with no rule of law and educated in ways that do not vibrate with you, as resulted with these child wards all over the USA.<br /><br />You do not give up any benefits or rights. You make it possible to move your Jurisdiction to a Judicial Assembly which practices what is known as Common Law. <br />There are Judicial Assemblies forming in Eastern, Central, Mountain and Pacific Regions of the United States. As citizens form Judicial Assemblies in every County<br />&nbsp;of the United States of America, we will be removing, County by County, Civil Law from the ‘believed’ Government. This is how Civil Law falls away. <br />This is how we remove the Vatican Canon Code from ruling us as slaves. This is how we remove Civil Law from this Land. We cancel it out as we bring<br />&nbsp;Common Law back to the Courtroom. As we remove ourselves from Civil Law Jurisdiction, Plaintiffs invite Defendants in Courtrooms where Judges Practice Common Law.<br />&nbsp;You may try your case anywhere you want to then, with any Judge willing to hear it. This is how we reclaim our Birthright of Sovereignty. We do this action as<br />&nbsp;we come into our maturity as Spiritual Sentient Beings. We denounce our slavery, we are no longer chattel property, our children are FREE and we follow the<br />&nbsp;Universal Human Rights for all humanity. We are becoming awake so we may end slavery in this world where it still exists &quot;legally&quot;.<br /><br />The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Geneva, Switzerland reports that the Non Governmental Organizations (NGO&#039;s) have reported slavery and slavery-like practices in the following countries. It should be noted that the Confederate States of America is not listed. The next time one of the usual suspects starts hyperventilating about the &quot;flag of slavery,&quot; tell him this: The system of slavery in the Old South ended over 130 years ago. If you are so concerned about slavery, what are you doing to end it in these countries where it is still being practiced?<br /><br />MUCH MORE HERE http://www.galacticroundtable.com/ (http://www.galacticroundtable.com/)
