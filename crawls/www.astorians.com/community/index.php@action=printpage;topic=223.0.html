				I have to move soon, because of this I need to trim down my book collection by half (along with get rid of a whole mess of other stuff). The following is a list of books that didn't fit in the other categories that I am selling for $1.00 each. If you are interested in any of them please email me which books you are interested in at LadyKildara@gmail.com. I will try to keep the list refreshed so if I sell any I will take those off the list, and if I find more later in any of my boxes of books I have to go through I will add them to it. You can also find me most nights after 8pm at the Freeze Peach Cafe right here in Astoria on 29th and Ditmars. <br /><br />Sheldon Sidney - The Doomsday Conspiracy<br />Sheldon Sidney - The Stars Shine Down<br />Sheldon Sidney - Nothing Lasts Forever<br />Suzanne Forester - Husband Lover Stranger<br /><br />Dorathy Lehmkuhl &amp; Dolores Cotter - Organizing For The Creative Person.

				I have seen this done with dollar bills before. I have released a few of those dollar bills myself, never tried it with books though. I was also thinking that when we do move if I have no takers to give it to that guy that sells books for a dollar in front of CVS, I'm sure many people who stroll by there don't know about astorians.net yet and I know that's one of his only sources of income. Thanks for the site though, maybe I will try a few select books to do this with and see what happens.

				All the books are now free. I just want to get rid of them before I move. I don't want to throw them away.
