			Hillary 10,<br /><br />Allison is absolutely right on all accounts. &nbsp;I think Ditmars (around 20th ave) is prettier than the Broadway area. &nbsp;There are a lot more trees and gardens which makes for a nice walk home. &nbsp;Since it is less crowded, the average walk home can be very relaxing. &nbsp;If you are walking home late at night, you can actually hear the sound of nothing. &nbsp;Having grown up in a relatively rural area, its nice to hear occasionally. &nbsp;It is also much closer to Astoria Park. &nbsp;When I lived on Broadway, it took me about 1/2 hour to walk to Astoria park. &nbsp;I now live 2 blocks from the park. &nbsp;Since the Ditmars area is less crowded, you tend to get to know your neighbors and shop keepers. &nbsp;In my experience I know more of my neighbors and local business owns around Ditmars than I did around Broadway. &nbsp;I&#039;m sure other people on the board have had different experiences but this is what I found. &nbsp;<br /><br />I found that Broadway had more choices when it came to bars, grocery stores and laundromats. There are still a ton of places to eat around Ditmars. &nbsp;My favorites are Fatty&#039;s/Crescent &amp; Vine, Anna&#039;s Corner and Mezzo. &nbsp;Also expect to lengthen your train rides into Manhatten by about 15mins. &nbsp;Ditmars bound N/W trains have a habit of stopping and waiting at Astoria Blvd for anywhere between 2 to 15 mins. &nbsp; Keep in mind that 20th Ave west of 21st St gets to be a very long walk to the train. &nbsp;You almost need a car for your chores (almost).<br /><br />I hope this helps.

			oh, you mean lower elevation-wise? The stank smell isn&#039;t CONSTANT, but it definitely rears its stanky head in the summer, occasionally. I haven&#039;t figured out a pattern to it yet though. Its annoying, but it won&#039;t make you want to tear your nose off or anything. Either way, welcome to the north of Astoria Boulevard &#039;hood :)<br /><br />The industrial area doesn&#039;t bother me at all - but I grew up in a place where there&#039;s a lot of abandoned factories and whatnot, so it&#039;s pretty normal for me. The only *really* annoying thing to me about the industrial area is the trucks on Steinway. They pretty much stick to Steinway (to get to the BQE). So I&#039;m occasionally woken up at 6am to the lovely sounds of blaring 18-wheeler horns when people double park and they can&#039;t get through. But now that its supa-hot (and I have the AC or a fan running), I don&#039;t hear them when I&#039;m sleeping, and if you&#039;re in the 30s, you probably won&#039;t even notice them.

			I live on 19th Street, off of 24th Avenue and love it.&nbsp; I get up early on Saturday morning and drive to 30th Avenue for my fruits, veggies, meat etc. and do not mind at all.&nbsp; Key Food has a good selection locally.&nbsp; Top Tomato is not bad and offers good prices.&nbsp; We also have an organic place on 23rd Avenue.&nbsp; I like it much better in this area.&nbsp; I know all of my neighbors and I love running in the park every morning.&nbsp; Where will you be moving?&nbsp; What Avenue would you be near?&nbsp; Congrats on the house.

And since you have a car and parking isn&#039;t such a hassle up there, why not? Good luck!

			thanks for the encouragement, rover... sometimes it seems like a good move and then sometimes it just seems totally insane. all that money, most of which isn&#039;t ours but the banks, gone. . <br /><br />We both love that part of Astoria and it&#039;s good to hear that others do too. <br /><br />
