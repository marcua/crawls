				I may be working for a pyrotechnic company.&nbsp; I normally work on the firework show in Maryland, but due to a surgery on Sunday, I am going to slowly work on the show at the Great Escape amusement park in Lake George.&nbsp; Working on the show depends on how much more recovering I still may have left.

				I&#039;ll probably take a morning walk in the park, finally install the Stars and Bars on the roof of my building, finish sheetrocking and plastering a bedroom in my building, try to watch the Yank/Sox game, and relax in my hammock on the roof. (if the weather holds)&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m planning my day off to be on Sat.&nbsp;

				Not doing anything differently than usual, except for the bbq in the yard, some baseball watching, dog walking, and plain old just lazin&#039; around kind of weekend. I haven&#039;t decided if I want to fight the crowds on the FDR, LIC, Brooklyn Promenade or find some open rooftop, in order to watch the fireworks.

				I&#039;m feeling a summer cold coming so I&#039;m taking it easy.&nbsp; Might go see &quot;Hancock&quot;.<br /><br />But if you&#039;re into hot dog eating contests, here&#039;s a parody I wrote and directed for July 4th starring Christian Finnegan, Sean Crespo, et al.&nbsp; My first video and I think it&#039;s pretty funny and PG-13.<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXxSGIIfTk<br /><br />EDIT:&nbsp; Guess I can&#039;t embed videos.
