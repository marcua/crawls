				Was the diddy about &quot;drugs are dangerous (dangerous) they will make you delirious...we&#039;re not candy, even thought we look so fine and dandy...&quot; a school house rock song? If so, its my favorite.

				Ha-Ha I totally remeber that song too Alexa! That was actually a PSA - they had such great PSA&#039;s back in the early 80&#039;s! Got to love the singing pills. I wonder if that commercial was only shown in the tri-state area or if it was showed across the country?

				To be fair, I have really only seen a coupld of these, so my voting range was limited...what are the years that school house rock was big? Probably affects voting. Even younger cats have heard of conjunction junction. And then there was the Simpson revival of Just a Bill.
