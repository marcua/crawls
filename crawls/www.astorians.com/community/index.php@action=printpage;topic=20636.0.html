				Does anyone know what&#039;s going on with Aphrodite (Ditmars &amp; 33rd St)? They used to be Ditmars Gyro Place, but they renovated a couple years ago and changed their name (same family still ran the place though, and it was the same menu). Now they&#039;re closed up. It is my favorite take-out/delivery place up here on Ditmars, and every time my parents came to visit, we&#039;d go there. Their chicken souvlaki = magic.<br /><br />I really really really hope they&#039;re just renovating again, but since they just did a couple years ago, I&#039;m doubtful. Someone give me hope!

				they changed the name to Aphrodite because Ditmars Gyro Place was once shut down by Dept of Health.<br />they had one of those big orange stickers on the door.<br />i guess they wanted the general public to think it became a different place,<br />so they &quot;renovated&quot; and changed the name.<br /><br />personally, i never ate anything from there.<br />i didnt like how when you open the front door, the air from outside blows DIRECTLY on the grill and gyro spit.

				They weren&#039;t shut down this time around. Ok, fine they got a B, but they had passed (I have eaten there every week for the past 6 years with no problems). Just wondering what&#039;s going on...

				Most places in Greece and Cyprus (and the US?) use an electric knife to slice gyro meat. It&#039;s easy and fast and keeps the hungry crowd at bay ;)

				According to my barber Alex (who is next door), the owner of the gyro place packed up and moved back to Greece as his kids here are now grown up and on their own.&nbsp; The people who own Flo on 30th Avenue are taking over the space and making it into a small cafe.<br /><br />Hope this helps.

				&nbsp;:-(<br /><br />I wish I would have known! I almost went there a couple nights before they closed. If I had known, I definitely would have! It was my very favorite takeout, and their chicken souvlaki was some of the best I&#039;ve had.

				I just passed by there yesterday. It looked like there was construction going on, but the city posted a sign stopping work due to unsafe conditions.

				Sad to hear this.&nbsp; I do use to frequent Aphrodite&#039;s, esp for the Gyro&#039;s and homemade Greek pastries... <br />I hope the new addition is something we can all benefit from...
