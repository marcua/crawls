				Popular NYC eatery shut down for rodents<br /><br />40 minutes ago<br /><br />NEW YORK - While serendipity may be the art of finding pleasant things by chance, what health inspectors found at celebrated eatery Serendipity 3 was not very agreeable.<br /><br />Officials closed the restaurant Wednesday night after it failed its second inspection in a month. An inspector spotted a live mouse and mouse droppings, fruit flies, house flies and more than 100 live cockroaches.<br /><br />&quot;Both inspections revealed rodent and fly infestation and conditions conducive to pest infestation, including stagnant water in the basement,&quot; the department said.<br /><br />People stand in line for hours outside the Manhattan restaurant, known for its extravagant and expensive desserts. Its $25,000 Frrrozen Haute Chocolate features top-grade cocoa, edible gold and shavings of a luxury truffle and was declared the most expensive dessert in the world by Guinness World Records. The eatery also offers a $1,000 sundae named Golden Opulence requiring 48-hour advance notice.

				I lived on the UES when I first moved to NYC and could never figure out the appeal of that claustrophobic rathole.&nbsp; Why people would stand in line for their overpriced food and crappy ice cream with chintzy decor straight out of a raggedy-ann-movie-of-the-week is beyond me. <br /><br />I was so happy when Dylan&#039;s Candy Bar opened up just down the block. I still go out of my way to go there. Their ice cream is some of the best I&#039;ve ever had; and its a sundae I actually don&#039;t mind paying $10 for! <br />
