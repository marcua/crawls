			Do you know that CVS Pharmacy is such a monopoly that they pick and choose what insurances they will take to fill prescriptions.&nbsp; I am grateful for Crescent Apothecary because at least that CVS has turned away my prescriptions, there is someone gracious enough to accept my insurance since CVS wants to be a bully and could care less about people in need of medical services.&nbsp; Just thought you should know that!

There are dozens of pharmacies in Astoria. And picking and choosing which coverage you accept is a decision most doctors and pharmacies make. I love how you call them a bully yet you are the one who thinks a private business needs to accept your coverage because you said so. That makes you a bully.&nbsp;
