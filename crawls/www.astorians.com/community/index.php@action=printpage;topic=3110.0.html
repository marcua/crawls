				Last year I participated in this and found it really rewarding.&nbsp; When we started, the shore looked SUPER NASTY, littered with, well, litter.&nbsp; We cleaned it up and it looked AMAZING!&nbsp; What a difference.<br /><br />Well, the shoreline cleanup is happening again this year.&nbsp; I think it would be great to have an astorians.com contingent out there helping out.&nbsp; I&#39;ll be there.&nbsp; Anyone interested in joining me?&nbsp; Here are the details:<br /><br /><strong>Shoreline Cleanup and Celebration!</strong><br /><br /><strong>What: </strong>Doing good in the neighborhood -- Join the Astoria/LIC Waterfront Parks Alliance as we enhance our beautiful shoreline! Sites include Astoria Park, Hallets Cove, and Socrates Sculpture Park. Come prepared to get a bit wet and dirty. Tools, gloves, and good company provided! Cleanup held rain or shine- thunderstorm cancels.<br /><br /><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, September 16, 2006. Time TBA.<br /><br /><strong>Where:</strong> Astoria Park, Hallets Cove, and Socrates Sculpture Park<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>More info:</strong>&nbsp; For more info, or to get involved, please call 718-706-8044, or email Emily.Maxwell@parks.nyc.gov. For info on the day of the event, please call 917-902-9165.<br /><br />Last year there was a party afterwards, and I know they&#39;ve been talking about having one this year, too.&nbsp; It might get merged with an even bigger community celebration, which is cool.&nbsp; I&#39;ll post more details as I learn them.

				Last year there were a couple groups there that came as a team.&nbsp; I wonder if astorians.com members could be there (at more than one cleanup site as is convenient for each person) as team.&nbsp; What do you think?&nbsp; Does anyone like this idea?<br /><br />So good to see interest here in this project!
