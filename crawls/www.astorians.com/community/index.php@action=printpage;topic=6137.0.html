				Beautiful, friendly calico approx. 5mos. old was just found here at work.<br /><br />She&#039;s clearly had a home b/c she&#039;s in good shape, affectionate and social. We&#039;re hoping somebody can take her as we can&#039;t keep her in the office, and the feral cats that hang out in the parking lot have already attacked her. We don&#039;t think she&#039;s fixed, however.<br /><br />Of course this is a long shot but I&#039;m hopeful!

And so would most of this office.<br /><br />Kitten is being boxed up as we speak, my co-worker might be able to bring it home on the subway into the city&nbsp; :| but we&#039;ll see. <br /><br />At the very least a foster home until we can find her some permanent digs.

				Just gotta say this neighborhood rocks. Kitty will have a place to stay overnight until I take her back to the office tomorrow.&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />She escaped from the box in the car and sat in the back window, clinging onto the back window like a surfer and meowing now and then. She seemed to enjoy it! <br /><br />Stay tuned.......

				Kitty spent the night in my bedroom -- spent about 15 seconds under the bed and the rest terribly content to lie on a little green towel on the bed.<br /><br />We have a vet appointment this AM at Astoria Vet Group (good vets!) and will post update following.&nbsp; She is lovely and sweet.&nbsp; I hope to make her a permanent fixture in my home but as I have another kitty some of that decision is pending updated health status.<br /><br />I&#039;ve taken to calling her Twiggy since she&#039;s beeeautiful, a little mod, and model thin.<br /><br />

				Thanks for the updates, we thought her belly was a bit fat but she&#039;s so thin otherwise&nbsp; :-o<br /><br />Finding homes for kittens is easy; finding *responsible* owners is the hard part! Ah but kitten season is upon us so at the shelter they&#039;re likely to find good homes, if not by word of mouth.

				She&#039;s so pretty. More pics!&nbsp; :lol:<br /><br />Cats have to be around 12 weeks before they can be fixed. The new owners need to be committed to that at the very least. But I suspect that&#039;s preaching to the choir here. There should be low-cost programs in Queens, possibly through the ASPCA.

				I&#039;ve put up a few more photos.<br /><br />http://flickr.com/photos/jaymee/sets/72157600148758736/<br /><br />Yesterday evening she got a mini-bath with some kitty wet wipes.&nbsp; Oh so happy.&nbsp; She&#039;s getting softer and shinier already!&nbsp; She ate about 8 times.&nbsp; Possibly 10.&nbsp; Eating was followed by huge kitty gulps of water.&nbsp; So far she won&#039;t leave any food behind in the bowl so I&#039;ve been feeding her incrementally throughout the day so she won&#039;t eat so much and so fast that she loses her food.<br /><br />She spotted the Other Cat in the house and there was a brief exchange of worry from Other Cat that there was not enough food in the house for TWO cats.&nbsp; Today she wandered around a bit and spent some time near Other Cat as Other Cat continued to stress his dismay that he was not consulted and he hadn&#039;t had any morning coffee and he just didn&#039;t feel like entertaining.&nbsp; Twiggy is very content to spend time in her own room away from Other Cat and doesn&#039;t meow much except when she needs a bit of a pet on the head.&nbsp; Even so she seems to understand that it is not always possible to pet on demand so after a few little meows she&#039;ll settle down to wait it out until a human can be had for kitty love.<br /><br />Today Twiggy was also temporarily relocated to location #2 -- my sister&#039;s house -- as I am traveling for a few days.&nbsp; She seemed to enjoy the car ride over and made time for a quick nap between the avenues.&nbsp; Twiggy&#039;s new room is a little smaller but the food is bountiful and the human is an excellent under the chin scratcher.<br /><br />She is getting a little bit better about having her photo taken and sister has promised photo updates (and hopefully astorians updates).<br /><br /><br />

				Weekend update on Twiggy:<br /><br />She seems to have adjusted to her new room (my bathroom), but she often enjoys her time to get out and explore a bit.&nbsp; Twiggy has to alternate apartment free time with the dog of the apartment (who is very jealous and curious about the new beast in the bathroom).<br /><br />While we had taken her towel out for washing, she was enjoying looking out for hiding spots in her new room, but our kitty fort seems to be maintaining its barriers well.&nbsp; She has made her bed in her original carrier box with one side folded down and her towel inside.&nbsp; She has an orange nightlight so she doesn&#039;t get scared of the dark.<br /><br />Not quite sure why, but she has had a bit of a rough time with kitty &quot;morning sickness&quot; both last night and today.&nbsp; She is not keeping down wet or dry food or water.&nbsp; I have called the vet and we will be visiting tomorrow to find out what&#039;s going on.&nbsp; Will post update/major developments.&nbsp; For tonight, she&#039;s getting some extra TLC and seems ok- still purring and laying around.&nbsp; <br /><br />Will be posting some new pictures from today- tried to get more head/profile shots.&nbsp; Overall, she&#039;s been a lovely houseguest and she seems to find the accommodations suitable.

				Both last night and this morning, Twiggy has not hesitated to let me know that she&#039;s pregnant and hungry!!&nbsp; I gave her a little bit of food last night, but she didn&#039;t keep it down.&nbsp; When I had left for work this morning, she had kept down some morning dry food.&nbsp; When I came home she had finished the food and was hungry for more!<br /><br />Yay!&nbsp; Twiggy did not need to go to the vet and seems back on an eating and digesting schedule.&nbsp; She has been sleeping a lot this evening and purring a lot, too.&nbsp; <br /><br />Today I had some of my seventh grade students making predictions about Twiggy- her due date, the number of kittens she&#039;ll have, and offer name suggestions.&nbsp; Their names are not very original.&nbsp; Overall the vote has been 5 kittens on May 8 or 10.&nbsp; Any other predictions?<br /><br />Also, have some new and adorable (of course) photos posted for today.<br /><br />http://www.flickr.com/photos/jaymee/sets/72157600148758736/

				Still no kittens (whew!).&nbsp; I always get a little nervous when I get home from work and open Twiggy&#039;s door.&nbsp; She seems a bit droopier today.&nbsp; I suppose she&#039;s just feeling a bit big and pregnant.&nbsp; She is very interested in all food and keeping it all down.&nbsp; Yay!!<br /><br />Big thanks to SpecialK for bringing by some twiggy towels and paying a visit.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure they will come in handy soon.<br /><br />Otherwise we&#039;re pretty much getting our routine down.&nbsp; My dogbeast, Missy, has been a bit put out by the change in her routine and having to share the apartment and the human with Twiggy.&nbsp; They&#039;ve been separate, but are aware of each other.&nbsp; Missy has gone to smell Twiggy&#039;s room every time she comes out for her apartment time.&nbsp; Mostly it just means Missy gets spoiled even more with some yummy treats and extra love.&nbsp; She&#039;s beginning to adjust.<br /><br />New pics added today.

				Last night and today, Twiggy&#039;s been pretty worn out.&nbsp; She is moving around less and sleeping a lot more.&nbsp; She purrs while she sleeps and even falls asleep on my arm or lap.&nbsp; Her favorite spot today has been a living room chair.<br /><br />Looks like this is a normal progression of cat pregnancy.&nbsp; As I&#039;ve read about it- I found this strange, but true (I guess) fact.&nbsp; A cat can stop the birthing process and resume it hours later.&nbsp; The reason I&#039;ve read so far is just if the mother feels threatened or lacks privacy.&nbsp; Another reason I just read about today is that a mother could stop labor if kittens were conceived at different times and/or by different fathers.&nbsp; Maybe Twiggy will need to go on a paternity talk show to find out who the daddy (or daddies) are.<br /><br />That&#039;s about it- really the same as yesterday.&nbsp; And of course, new pics.

				I haven&#039;t seen Twiggy in FIVE DAYS but we are nearing her expected term so I think the tiredness/purring could be kitty pregnancy.&nbsp; She is definitely a cat heavy on the purrs but also heavy on the affection and I haven&#039;t seen distress signs from the time I&#039;ve spent with her -- but it is a valid point that sometimes cat purrs are not always happy.<br /><br />I suppose we could move all the Twiggy all the time to you know, a more appropriate venue than the classified ads...<br /><br />-j

				So she was still droopy today and we took her to the vet (a convenient 3 blocks from Darcee&#039;s apartment).&nbsp; Vet gave some fluids and prescribed kitten safe antibiotics because she suspects it&#039;s a little kitty virus.&nbsp; Either that or we are just close to delivery and twigs is just feeling pregnant and uncomfortable.&nbsp; We should see a turnaround in the droopiness in the next day or so.&nbsp; <br /><br />Twiggy didn&#039;t get to move to my house because we worried about stressing her out more.&nbsp; It looks like the kittens might be happening at Location 2.<br /><br />I think a blog is coming up shortly.&nbsp; Continued updates in the classifieds just seem silly :)<br />

				This update is NOT what you think.<br /><br />While we waited with kitten expectations last night, it was not meant to be.&nbsp; Twiggy remained sedate through most of the night moving between her spot in the box to her spot in the cat bag.&nbsp; Darcee and I kept up an hourly check in schedule.&nbsp; At the 6-7am check in, Twiggy vomitted and settled back down but seemed to be declining rather than improving.&nbsp; We decided to let her continue to rest for the early morning hours with a plan to take her to the vet in the morning.&nbsp; She continued to move between the two spots but something was still not quite right.&nbsp; Darcee and I took a coffee break to talk out all the scary possibilities (thank you google) and strategize.&nbsp; When we got back to the apartment to check on Twiggy, she was having seizures.<br /><br />Twiggy was non-responsive and seizing so we put her in the bag and hauled ass to the vet -- calling in the three block trip to inform them again of our emergency and estimated arrival time.&nbsp; Dr. Smith came to take us back as soon as we were announced and things were not looking good for Twiggy.&nbsp; We discussed the limited options.&nbsp; Because of her pregnancy and uncertain background and life on the streets history AND rapid deline AND severity of her current condition -- there was virtually nothing left to do.&nbsp; It was clear to all of us she was suffering and at the recommendation of the vet and our conscience, we decided it was best to put her to sleep.<br /><br />While there was no conclusive diagnosis it is suspected that Twiggy may have had kitty distemper -- a rapidly moving, debilating, and often fatal cat virus that can be prominent in stray cats.&nbsp; This is a disease that cats are vaccinated against that is entirely preventable by taking pro-active, reasonable, and responsible measures to get your cat vaccinated.&nbsp; Even after finding a good and safe home, Twiggy fell vicitim to irresponsible pet owners who abandoned her, neglected to spay her, and whose blatant abuse in refusing to vaccinate her against entirely preventable diseases cost the life of Twiggy and her kittens.<br /><br />We had a great week with her and are happy that we had a chance to welcome her into a loving home.&nbsp; We have no regrets about our course of action in adopting or caring for Twiggy in her much-too-short time with us.&nbsp; We are sorry to bring you the sad news of the kitten astorians have grown to love.&nbsp; Yes, the vet even cried. <br /><br />If anything now we hope to encourage (if not demand) responsible pet ownership (and vaccinations).&nbsp; We also hope you will consider supporting animal rescue groups and perhaps bring into your life a loving kitten/puppy/dog/cat beast/mother-to-be to share many happy weeks with.<br /><br /><br />Thank you for your concern and interest in the story of Twiggy.&nbsp; Please, no emails or private messages as her &quot;family&quot; is still grieving.

				My heart is totally breaking for Twiggy and her kittens&nbsp; :cry:<br /><br />I really need to do/say something about the lady who lives behind me (on the opposite side of the block) who feeds all the stray cats. There are a whole bunch out there, and they&#039;re camped out my my and her (and our neighbor&#039;s) backyards, and every few months, I hear kittens crying/meowing.

				Jayme had called me as I was driving up here to the Bronx to cat-sit for my sister&#039;s half-dozen rescue cats. I figured &quot;oh, she&#039;s having the kittens already, wonder how that&#039;s possible...&quot; before I got the message&nbsp; :-o<br /><br />So I&#039;m pretty upset but relieved for all the good people out there who have to pick up the slack for the a-holes&nbsp; :x I couldn&#039;t even remember what distemper WAS exactly- I knew cats were vaccinated for it, but with all the precautions taken for adopted cats, I never actually *knew* of a case.<br /><br />Jayme and Darcee- thank you for giving Twiggy a home, an identity, a modeling portfolio and a chance in her final week of life. She left with the dignity she rightfully deserved in her short life. At least she had the company of her babies&nbsp; :angel: Let me know if you need anything during this time of mourning- I&#039;ll be home tomorrow evening.

				Thanks for all the nice words.&nbsp; As to what you are supposed to do about cats wandering the streets, I don&#039;t really know.&nbsp; I expect they might be rounded up for the pound if you called 311 -- a better option might be to contact a local rescue group who would trap/fix/adopt them out.&nbsp; <br /><br />Maybe someone else has a better answer?&nbsp; Christine works with a shelter (though not a local one) -- any good ideas/advice?

				I should look into the shelter situation around here since it&#039;s where I live now. But I&#039;m very fond of the Grateful Paw shelter- it&#039;s no-kill, extremely organized, and the cats are in open rooms instead of cages (unless they&#039;re sick.) Really a nice place.<br /><br />It&#039;s frustrating in general: A guy I know tipped me off to an old house on 31st St. near the car rental place. There&#039;s a cat hoarder who lives there, and he saw her dozens of cats living in the garage.<br /><br />I called one agency after another, and eventually came full-circle. It was absurd. The ASPCA can&#039;t do anything unless the person who witnessed it first-hand calls in, and my friend didn&#039;t want to jeopardize his business relationship with this woman. Besides, there&#039;s no law against having a bunch of cats on the property and feeding them. <br /><br />I forgot who else I spoke with- health dep&#039;t or something. Cat hoarders who feed tons of strays seem to be just outside everybody&#039;s jurisdiction. Maybe it&#039;s a problem that the elected officials need to address. A new law needs to be created.<br /><br />In the meantime, if we each contribute what little we each have to offer, we can form the Underground Stray Railroad to ease the problem a bit.
