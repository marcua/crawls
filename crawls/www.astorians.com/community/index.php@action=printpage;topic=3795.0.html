				Okay. So my insomnia struck again and I went surfing. I&#39;ve had it with politics, medical information, Macintosh and blogs, so I started looking for a restaurant to go to when one of my kids comes to town.<br /><br />You may already know about the place, but it was a surprise to me.<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u"><strong>restaurant.com</strong></span> (http://www.restaurant.com/about_gcp.asp?pgn=gcp)<br /><br />You can search by location or type of food. I found a couple of really wonderful bargains in really nice restaurants.<br /><br />Now here is *my* trick. I searched <span class="bbc_u">google</span> (http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=restaurant.com+discount+code&amp;btnG=Google+Search) for a discount code to further enhance the bargain and I found one that worked. I put two $25.00 dining certificates in my shopping cart, and when requested used the discount code <span class="bbc_u"><strong>99923</strong></span> and it worked. So, I am now the proud owner of two $25.00 dining certificates (that&#39;s 50 bucks, folks) and it only cost me $10.00<br /><br />Now that&#39;s a nice deal.

This is one of my all-time <em>bestest</em> bargains around! When my friends and I want to try a new place, or a new food, I always check http://www.restaurants.com/ before heading out. I&#039;ve used their gift certificates in NY, NJ, PA, CT, VT, CA, FL WY, TX, DE, MA, ME and NH! I&#039;ve sent my children tickets for a show and a gift certificate for dinner before or after the show. <br /><br />The one I just bought for Sac&#039;s is going to be used by my best friend and me for our birthday! They are good for one year and I ALWAYS follow the instructions about what meal, or what times it can be applied. It is also great to save money on a new local restaurant, just in case it sucks!

It is worth 80% off any gift certificate!<br /><br />As soon as you pay for what it is in your cart, your gift certificates become printable. <br /><br />When I am looking local, I search 5 miles from my zip code. When I am looking for a particular cuisine, I search 100 miles and narrow it down to the type of cuisine.<br /><br />Play around, you&#039;ll be surprised how many restaurants you know and like(d) that you have to choose from. Like I said, I love the site. Except for some really fine-dining steakhouses, I&#039;ve always found something to fit the occasion. For those fine-dining steakhouses, I use my credit card&#039;s free reward points for a redeemable dining gift card.<br /><br />Can you tell that I don&#039;t like to pay retail for anything?<br />

				I&#039;ve got a new 80% off code for http://www.restaurants.com/<br /><br />The code is: SURPRISE. It&#039;s only good until Thursday, November 20, 2008. Remember the gift certificates are good for one year from date of purchase.<br /><br />Don&#039;t forget to look for your favorite restaurants in Manhattan and wherever your friends and family are living. I&#039;ve gotten a few really great ones for family in Los Angeles, and friends and family in NJ, PA, CT, VT, FL WY, TX, DE, MA, ME and NH.<br /><em><br />(Also, don&#039;t forget Sac&#039;s famous coal oven Pizza. And it&#039;s a great place for a quick meal. They offer a $25.00 gift Certificate and your cost is only $2.00 when you spend $35.00 The 18&quot; pizza is $19.95. Add your beverage, and perhaps a salad for the table or a yummy tiramisu for dessert and your final cost will only be a $12.00 including the cost of the Gift Certificate!)</em> And that pie can feed a family of four!

				One of my favorite places to eat, that never requires a code, is Chicken Festival, next to La Guli on Ditmars/31st St.&nbsp; While the decor is more of a fast-food restaurant, the broiled chicken is fantastic, and their garden rice rules.&nbsp; They also have some good South American sodas, Inca, Jarritos, etc.&nbsp; You can get a half chicken with rice for about $6.00.&nbsp; Yum!

				I just tried this site out for the first time yesterday and it worked great.&nbsp; If you order a $25 gift certificate and use the code DEAL at checkout, you get 50% off plus they will e-mail your a link to get a free $10 certificate.&nbsp; I think this offer is good through the 12th.

				Something to keep in mind is their Dinner of the Month Club. You get to choose which gift certificate you receive each month and those discount codes work for them too. So you can get 80% off on a 12-month membership, which translates into $24 for 12 $25 gift certificates and an extra $50 gift certificate as a free gift. Certainly easier than waiting around each month for another discount code to come along! That extra gift certificate doesn&#039;t hurt either. &nbsp;:mrgreen:

				Hi there.<br /><br />After reading this thread over the weekend, I decided to sign up for the &quot;Dinner of the Month&quot; club. With the 80% off code, I was able to purchase twelve $25 certificates for $24. (And I got an extra $50 certificate as a bonus!) As of today, I have not been charged for anything other than the $24 I was billed.<br /><br />However I should note that as soon as I completed my transaction on their website, the confirmation screen stated that I could receive a $10 rebate, and it gave a link for more information. When I clicked the link, it explained how you had to sign up for a free trial of Shopping Essentials in order to receive the &quot;rebate&quot;. I passed on it, but I wonder if those who listed the complaints about being charged for a Shopping Essentials membership got sidetracked by the rebate offer, and joined accidentally?<br /><br />I haven&#039;t used any certificates yet, but I&#039;ll report back once I do. I&#039;m psyched to begin trying new restaurants, and hoping the certificates work out as expected!<br /><br />

				Oh! Oh! Oh, Your Majesty . . . I do remember that nonsense. I also always pass on that type of crapola. But I imagine if you read the fine print, you&#039;d have a better understanding.<br /><br />Please let us know how your Gift Certificates work for you. I have never had any problems, but I ALWAYS call in advance and follow the rules (number of people, minimum purchase, time of day or days of week) and to the best of my knowledge, neither have any of my friends or my family had any problems. <br /><br />

				I was really skeptical as well, but got the Dinner of the Month club for my sister as a Christmas gift and received a $50 bonus for myself. She&#039;s had no problems using it in her hometown, and I redeemed $25 worth of my bonus at Mundo, which was great (foodwise and they dealt with the coupon with no problem). I had also heard of the Shopping Essentials &quot;scam&quot; but it&#039;s clearly a rebate with a recurring charge that people neglect to read the fine print for.&nbsp;

				Just curious, about to try this for the 1st time and wondering if restaurants are strict about putting down the 18% gratuity on the bill.&nbsp; Normally, if service/food is on par, we&#039;d tip this much, if not more.&nbsp; I&#039;m definitely not looking to stiff a server, but just feel a bit funny about being forced into a gratuity.&nbsp;

				I feel incredibly stupid, but I&#039;m going to ask anyway because I&#039;m getting myself confused by trying to figure it out..<br /><br />Here&#039;s a sample description:<br />&quot;Valid with a minimum purchase of $35. 18% gratuity added to pre-discounted check amount. Dinner only.&quot;<br /><br />So, let&#039;s say I have a $50 gift certificate from Restaurant.com and my guest and I spend exactly $50 on dinner.&nbsp; Will we then only pay the 18% service fee?&nbsp; Or does that mean that no matter the GC amount, I will have to pay $35 out of my pocket?&nbsp; Getting a $50 dinner for $4 + $9 (approx. gratuity) seems a little too good to be true.<br /><br />Thanks!

				As I understand it, on a $25 GC you need to spend at least $35 for the GC to be used. If you have a $50 GC you need to spend $65 in order to use the GC.<br /><br />As far as the gratuity goes, a restaurant may add it to the check, but you should be told in advance. This is how this was handled at one of my restaurants:<br /><br />FOOD:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;39.00<br />BAR:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 14.50<br />TAX:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.48<br />GRATUITY:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;9.83<br />Gift Certificate: (25.00)<br /><br />TOTAL:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 42.81<br /><br />I spent in excess of the $35 that was required, so my dinner companion and I split the expense at $21.40 each!

				&nbsp;:mrgreen:used one of these certificates for the first time last week at Elo on 31st Ave &amp; 12th Street.&nbsp; I was honestly skeptical at first, but they took it no problem at all and we got $25 off the bill for only 2-bucks!&nbsp; How cool was that.&nbsp; <br /><br />Will definitely keep an eye on this site.&nbsp; thanks for the tip.&nbsp;

				New 80% off coupon code: NAPKIN. Good through 7/28.<br /><br />Just a tip for those of you who really like bargains but are patient and willing to wait. I buy a lot of things in conjunction with ebates.com - an online store that offers cashback for going to online stores through their website. Restaurant.com is actually one of the sites they offer a deal for: 15% cashback on your purchase. So each certificate then only costs $1.70, which can really add up over time! Of course, it will take awhile to build up to the minimum earnings necessary for a check if you are only buying restaurant.com certificates, but if you do other online shopping, you can end up saving quite a bit of money! They also list active coupon codes for sites as well.

				I recently visited Gandhi Haute Cuisine of India on 30th ave and 34th street. I handed them my restaurant.com certificate, and they refused to allow me to use it. This might actually be against NYC statutes or laws, but I didn&#039;t hassle about it. I got up, left, and went around the corner to Seva. It was great, as usual, and I will not be patronizing Gandhi for any reason whatsoever in the future.<br /><br />Just a heads up in case any of you purchased a certificate through them and are wanting to go.<br />

				As the restaurant is still listed as a participant, I would contact restaurant.com at 1.888.745.6991, option 1, and tell a customer service representative what happened to you. They will issue you a credit immediately.
