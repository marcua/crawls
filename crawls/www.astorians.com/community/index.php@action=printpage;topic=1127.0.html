				I don't like nail-clipping either, but I've only seen it a couple of times.<br /><br />Most of the others I encounter on a daily basis. &nbsp;I'm surprised the homicide rate in NYC isn't higher.

				I've never clipped my nails on the subway, but I'm curious why this is bothersome (assuming they have a device that captures the clipped nails). &nbsp;I would be bothered by nails flying everywhere but assuming they wouldn't is it still weird for other people. &nbsp;I for one have never seen anyone do it on the train so I can't objectively say if it would or wouldn't bother me.

				when i have seen people doing it they have had no device. &nbsp;the clippings just go onto the floor or whatever. &nbsp;<br /><br />it doesn't bug me as much as the gum smacking, which to me is far more gross.<br /><br />it's funny what different people think is gross.

				I feel that clipping your nails in public is not appropriate. &nbsp;It should be done in the privacy of one's own home. &nbsp;I was taught this from an early age. &nbsp; Plus the sound of the nails being clipped totally skeeves me.

				Nail clipping is my number one pet peeve on the subway. &nbsp;Maybe because I know what it is, but I find the sharp clicking sound nearly intolerable. &nbsp;(But oddly enough, gum cracking barely registers.) &nbsp;Yeah, like Meg said. &nbsp;Skeeve.<br /><br />*shudder*

				I was sitting across from a woman grooming her nails for 20 minutes last night. &nbsp;YUCK!!! &nbsp;So gross. &nbsp;Shrapnel everywhere.<br /><br />And to add to the list...<br />People who litter on the train! &nbsp;I saw a girl yesterday eating Chinese food on the train. &nbsp;She had 2 plastic bags sitting on her lap while she ate. &nbsp;Fine. &nbsp;I'm not a big fan of people eating on the trains, but it could be worse. &nbsp;But she used a couple of napkins. &nbsp;Did she put the used napkins in her bag? &nbsp;Of course not. &nbsp;Drops them on the floor under her seat. &nbsp;Amazing. &nbsp;<br /><br />It just perplexes me how people have such little respect for their city, i.e. home. &nbsp;This is where we live. &nbsp;Shouldn't we take pride in it and respect it?

What I dont understand is why someone needs to clip clip clip clip clip clip clip for ONE nail. People PLEASE do this at HOME. Not that any of us do this on the subway, however maybe someone from the outside will see it and spread the word. I guess it all comes down to the fact the we are indeed all different in our own special ways.......Shrapnel everywhere, that one killed me.....because it is too true! Clip Clip!
