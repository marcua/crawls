				Has anyone had any luck getting noisy neighbors to stop?&nbsp; I spent a lot of time and money finding what it is a great apartment in a great building, only to find the neighbors across the hall are 10 people (8 kids under 15) in a one-bedroom apartment.&nbsp; They&#39;ve been in the apartment over 10 years and the landlord can not get them evicted in spite of many attempts.&nbsp; <br /><br />The problem is they are crowded into&nbsp; the living room (the bedroom is packed with beds obviously), 8 kids...yelling, screaming, crying (some are still infants) and they leave their door open.&nbsp; They don&#39;t respond to people begging them to have some consideration. The only response, is basically &quot;tough&quot;.&nbsp; The building will only send letters, which they just ignore and have been for years.<br /><br />Any advice at all?&nbsp; I&#39;m looking to move, but have had no luck finding a place nearby. Alternatively, if you know a good broker....<br /><br />

				It&#39;s hard to get two kids to calm down, let alone 8.&nbsp; Since they stand no chance of being evicted, I say - give it up, pack it in, and get to steppin&#39; as quickly as your lease allows.&nbsp; Try renting out a house maybe?

				Ha, no, won&#39;t be renting a house anytime soon, certainly not in Astoria.&nbsp; Was more curious if anyone had any sucess complaining to the police (which I wouldn&#39;t think is helpful).&nbsp; The building has been attempting to have them evicted for overcrowding, but now I think they are trying for a noise complaint thing.&nbsp; So was thinking having it at least recorded (officially) could be helpful.&nbsp; I don&#39;t feel too bad, apparently, the actually own houses (and several businesses), but rent them out to other people.

				What&#39;s wrong with renting out part of a house in Astoria?&nbsp; I&#39;m doing that now.&nbsp; I was just suggesting it because you would have less neighbors to deal with, and you might luck out with a nice landlord.

				Oh, rent part of a house, yeah I&#39;ve been considering that too.&nbsp; Thought you meant rent a whole house to avoid neighbors.&nbsp; I don&#39;t mind the typical situation, apartment noise, etc.&nbsp; It&#39;s to be expected.&nbsp; But a baseball team of children and no attempt to even keep your door closed to show some consideration to others, that&#39;s just rude.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have to talk to the property management people to see how the latest eviction proceedings went, then will decide what to do.&nbsp;

				I don&#39;t know why your landlord can&#39;t get them evicted.&nbsp; It sounds like they are living there illegally (unless their apartment is huge).<br /><br />HOUSING MAINTENANCE CODE (http://tenant.net/Other_Laws/HMC/hmc003.txt)<br /><br />Every person occupying an apartment in a Class A or Class B multiple dwelling or in a tenant-occupied apartment in a one- or two-family dwelling shall have a liveable area of not less than 80 square feet. The maximum number of persons who may occupy any such apartment shall be determined by dividing the total liveable floor area of the apartment by 80 square feet.&nbsp; For every two persons who may lawfully occupy an apartment, one child under four may also reside therein, except that a child under four is permitted in an apartment lawfully occupied by one person. No residual floor area of less than 80 square feet shall be counted in determining the maximum permitted occupancy for such apartment.

				Hey... I feel for you.&nbsp; &nbsp;My upstairs neighbors have 4 kids and I have an apartment that I feel would seem &quot;cozy&quot; with 2 people.&nbsp; &nbsp;They have a habit of bouncing balls in their apartment.&nbsp; I complained to the guy we laughingly call a super and spoke to them personally.&nbsp; &nbsp; It calmed down quite a bit.&nbsp; &nbsp;They still make more than their share of noise, but not as bad as it once was.&nbsp; Because I didn&#39;t press the issue, I now feel absolutely no guilt when I watch movies or blast music thru my stereo.<br /><br />I would definately make a complaint to the city.&nbsp; Embellish it if you can.&nbsp; It may make them get there faster and I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll find something wrong with the setup they have.&nbsp; &nbsp;Say you think they&#39;re running an illegal, unliscensed babysitting service or something.&nbsp; &nbsp; What type of people are they??&nbsp; Perhaps you could find their kryptonite and exploit it.&nbsp; &nbsp;If they&#39;re muslim, start making noise around prayer time and cook lots of bacon.&nbsp; &nbsp;How about a shot of pepper spray or a stink-bomb in the hallway every once in a while.&nbsp; How many other people in the building??&nbsp; Get everyone else to call too.&nbsp; &nbsp;I need more information to devise the best course of action.&nbsp; &nbsp;Are they on the top floor?&nbsp; Get a basketball and go up on the roof.&nbsp; I&#39;m feeling particularly devoius today, so get post more info.<br /><br />Good luck reguardless<br /><br />(If you go the loud, obnoxious party route...

				Oh, man. I feel for you. I know exactly how you feel. You know, unfortunately, I don&#39;t think there are any legal remedies since all that noise is happening in their apartment.<br /><br />However, on the lease of my girlfriend, there is a clause in their about &quot;noise...&quot; and saying that after 11:00 p.m., all residents of a building must be able to enjoy quiet time. Check to see if your lease has something like that.<br /><br />I think what the other poster suggested (writing a polite letter) is a good idea. Just don&#39;t follow the rest of it (being nasty/noisy in return). It will make them just be more noisy. <br /><br />I left a very nice note to my neighbor saying that their music was waking us up early in the morning, and asked if they could just turn it down. And, they certainly have! And, we are still all friendly.

This problem has been going on for years. But note the resident said in effect, &#39;we will protest but there is nothing we can do about it.&#39; <br /><br />It is sad that unless something is within a narrowly defined agenda set by our politicians (that benefits them, and not us necessarily,) grassroots concerns are simply ignored. Years of false promises and lip service by the politicians (noise/motorcycles at Astoria Park, anyone?) have bread hopelessness and apathy in the local community. May explain all those empty rooms at the power outage meetings. <br /><br />In Queens you will never see &#39;unseemly&#39; events like the recent protest in Brooklyn against Ratnerville. If you don&#39;t like things shut up and sit down ... or move.<br /><br />Apathy is the politicians&#39; best friend. &#39;Public&#39; initiatives come in one direction: from the top down.<br /><br />Of course, if you try to interfer with the public&#39;s ability to extract every little penny out of their personal real estate strip mine you will have a howling mob on your hands - another bad habit they picked up from their &#39;leadership.&#39;<br /><br />That being said, I firmly believe that boards like this provide a real opportunity for people to communicate directly with each other, and perhaps, make some real changes. Call the community board, the politicians, write letters to the press, and above all, share your experiences here.

				This letter is in the Chronicle this week. <br /><br />For many of us longer residents, this mirrors our experience on calling about noise, sanitation, illegal crowding etc. <br /><br />This raises a sensitive topic: when it comes to quality of life issues, has the machine decided to favor the sensibilities of certain groups over others? If so, why? <br /><br />Perhaps a whole thread could examine that!<br /><br /><br />Inaction On Noise <br /><br />Dear Editor: <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;As many of our fellow residents in South Ozone Park are aware, summer here signals party season, with outrageously loud music, DJ mikes, drums, port a potties on the sidewalk, and huge crowds packed into small driveways and backyards, often for days and nights on end. I was curious about just how noise complaints are handled by our local precinct, and so wrote to Police Commissioner Ray Kelly. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I received a call from a sergeant at the 106th Precinct and she answered my questions and assured me that the noise situation was a priority here under Operation Silent Night and that port a potties on the sidewalk are blatantly illegal and will not be tolerated. As a follow up, I was visited at my home by the local beat officer and I provided him with a list of problem homes, where the partying goes on every weekend, and where summonses have been issued before. I was told that this area would be patrolled and that situations like the ones described would be taken care of. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Only a few days after that visit, two parties kept us all awake on both a Friday and Saturday night. The Friday night party was at one of the problem houses I alerted the officer to. It began at 1 a.m. and blasted us until nearly 3:30 a.m. The party was filled with drunken young men who after throwing up on the sidewalk in front of the house, got into their cars and drove away. The 106th Precinct was called and did not respond. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;On Saturday night, there was another party complete with the illegal port a potty on the sidewalk, loud DJ music, loads of double parked cars, motorcycles and a huge crowd that spilled into the street. The next morning, I don’t want to tell you what the block looked like. The 106th Precinct was called at the numbers provided to me by the precinct and no one even picked up the phone. On the fourth try of calling the regular precinct number, an officer picked up and hurriedly said he’d send someone over. About 10 to 15 minutes after that call, a police van did a drive by, whooped its siren and kept right on going, past a loud party that had spilled out onto the street and sidewalk, with young people drinking and sprawled over double parked cars, stoops, as well as other people’s property. Needless to say, the port a potty stood until the next morning, and the party went on until 5 a.m. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;My family and I are great supporters of the NYPD, I myself am a 9/11 survivor and will never forget what I saw that day and the sheer heroism of New York’s Finest. I am fully aware that police resources are stretched thin, but I can’t help but feel that there is plenty of political correctness going on here, spiced with a healthy dose of ethnic sensitivity. It is no secret that these parties are almost exclusively held at the homes of immigrants from Guyana, Trinidad and India (as evidenced by the blasting Bollywood and reggae music). <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I myself worked for the federal government and for a member of Congress and I well know the pressure to be culturally sensitive and aware of diversity. That is all well and good, but the law is the law, and should be applied equitably. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;There can be no real quality of life when behavior like this is allowed. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Ann Rychlenski, <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Ozone Park <br /><br />

				Well, thanks for all the advice!&nbsp; It turns out that the buildings latest eviction case against them has a second court date scheduled for next month.&nbsp; They are trying to evict them for overcrowding, of which there is no doubt they are.&nbsp; The problem is the law was intended for overcrowding by adults and in this case it is because they just kept having children.&nbsp; I guess that gives the courts some hesitation on applying the law as written. I used to feel bad myself, but they own houses they rent out and own businesses and from other things I&#39;ve seen, can afford to move. <br /><br />The lease indicates no noise should be made at anytime that disturbs other tenants, so I could sue the building for my fees and moving expenses because they are not providing that.&nbsp; I&#39;m not sure if I have an recourse against the tenant.&nbsp; I used legalmatch.com to find a lawyer, which was recommended here, and is a great resource-sort of like lendingtree, but for lawyers. For now, I&#39;m waiting to see what happens next month and if the building loses and what they do for a new suit.<br /><br />For all of the other ideas, I&#39;m going to see what happens and how it goes. I hesitate to do anything that disrupts other apartments. But love the airhorn and stink bomb approaches ;)&nbsp; <br /><br />Oh yes, more seriously, talking to them (letters, etc) doesn&#39;t help as the father threatens to kill anyone who even politely asks their consideration.

				No. Actually just the opposite.&nbsp; They are muslim (is that the right term?) Which I at first thought was actually cool finding it a fascinating religion and with a few bad examples aside, the people seem to be more respectful, considerate, quiet, etc than most.&nbsp; That&#39;s true of the wife and the kids (aside from all the noise and chaos of kids being kids, they are polite when passing in the hall, etc).&nbsp; It&#39;s just the father and his attitude that is poor.&nbsp; I don&#39;t care if they make all the noise they want behind closed doors, but if you are going to open your door, at least make an attempt to show consideration for other people.

				I don&#39;t think so.&nbsp; The courts were brought in by the building management, who obviously stand to make a lot of money for getting them out, noise or not.&nbsp; It&#39;s a rent stabilized building and they have been in for over 10 years.&nbsp; So on the increase they are allowed and the extra for remodeling the apartment they will probably make $1,000 per month on rent more than they are.
