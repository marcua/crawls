IF anyone knows of anything in the area, please let me know. <br /><br />we have no pets, no car, are all professionals in our late 20s&nbsp; with excellent rental history. Thanks!

				Hello.&nbsp; I have a 3 bed available but the third bedroom is a bit small.&nbsp; Just one bathroom&nbsp; as well.&nbsp; However, entire apt is completely renovated with spanking new kitchen.&nbsp; New oak floors, moldings, yada, yada.&nbsp; It is a 3 family house around the block from cavo.&nbsp; On the first floor.&nbsp; Looking for 2-3 people to rent it.&nbsp; Available currently for $2300.&nbsp; Must have excellent references.&nbsp; Let me know if you&#039;re interested enough to check it out.&nbsp; I live on the second floor so pretty much any day after work with enough notice will do.

				<br />Could you, would you, also put me in touch with this lovely person? I am getting tired of the auto-replies to my emails to the &quot;by owner&quot; posts and time is trickling away... Studio or 1 br this time, that&#039;s harder to do in Astoria I hear than a 3br.
