				Craig and I have become quite smitten with this show.&nbsp; Anyone watching this season?&nbsp; They&#039;ve brought back a lot of the teams from previous seasons, some who you love to hate (Team Guido and Rob&amp;Amber) and some that are endearing (Uchenna and Joyce).&nbsp; I&#039;ve been taken with how much more intense and competitive they are in this season, but maybe that&#039;s to be expected with them all having competed before.

				Thanks for starting this thread!&nbsp; :-) I love the Amazing Race.&nbsp; I have tried to turn my friends into junkies, but unfortunately, none of them have caught on!&nbsp; <br /><br />I like the concept, but I would have liked to see some different teams (I guess it has to do with availability).&nbsp; What about the dating Christian models?&nbsp; Or that punk kid who reminded me of Cory Feldman and his girlfriend? <br /><br />Out of the remaining teams, I am going for either Uchena and Joyce or Eric &amp; Danielle.&nbsp; I truly despise Rob &amp; Amber, Charla and Mirna and Terri &amp; Ian.&nbsp; I was really hoping that Charla and Mirna would have lost the keys for real and would have never been able to finish the race.&nbsp; Based on their strengths, Rob &amp; Amber will probably win.&nbsp; &nbsp;:x<br /><br />

				I will be so depressed if Rob and Amber win.&nbsp; They annoy the heck out of me.&nbsp; I find Charla and Mirna somewhat charming, but they have annoying moments.&nbsp; I felt bad for the frat brothers, getting eliminated so early.&nbsp; I&#039;m hoping Team Guido goes soon too.

				I like Rob and Amber, I can&#039;t help myself.&nbsp; I&#039;d rather watch someone upfront like them than the mess that is Charla and Mirna.<br /><br />But my favorite returning team (now that Drew and Kevin are out so early) has got to be Danny and Oswald, Team Cha-Cha-Cha.&nbsp; I remember on their original season all the other teams were so cutthroat and &quot;playing the game&quot; and those two just seem to drift along to the front of the pack over and over.&nbsp; And they&#039;re funny.<br /><br />Least favorite teams would have to be Terry and Ian, Charla and Mirna and the always smug Team Guido.&nbsp; Those two always seem to be so easily impressed with themselves.

				I just think they are amoral.&nbsp; When they didn&#039;t stop to help the brothers in the car that had flipped over in Africa it really drove their lack of morals home to me.&nbsp; I think they&#039;re good competitors, just lousy people, Rob moreso than Amber.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have the same problem with Team Guido, I&#039;m actually somewhat ashamed that they are gay.&nbsp; They don&#039;t behave like decent folks, competitiveness is one thing, being unethical in order to win is another.

				Yeah Team Cha Cha Cha all the way.&nbsp; I think its funny how they always refer to their hot blooded Cuban-ness as to why they argue during missions and whatnot, but msot of the footage that makes it to air doesn&#039;t really have them blowing up at each other like say that jerk-off with the one legged partner from last season.&nbsp; <br /><br />So it seems that Danny and Oswald are the general favorites here, who would everyone like to see leave?&nbsp; I know I&#039;d like to see Team Guido, who I never ever liked and only made it to the finals in their season because the mom and daughter team (Nancy and Emily) essentially gave up, and then either Terri and Ian or Eric and Danielle.

				Meredith and Gretchen were the older team.&nbsp; They had spunk, but Gretchen could be so annoying.&nbsp; I would have liked to see the young gay guy and his mother come back.&nbsp; I wanted them to win so bad their season.&nbsp; <br />Terry and Ian don&#039;t annoy me as much as Charla and Mirna, but I&#039;m not really fond of Eric and Danielle.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t mind seeing Uchenna and Joyce win again.

				Oh yeah I almost forgot how much I hate Charla and Mirna. <br /><br />I would have liked to have seen Nancy and Emily come back, I always liked Emily and she&#039;s only a year younger than me so it could happen.&nbsp; :lol:<br /><br />I wasn&#039;t nuts about Susan and Patrick (the mom and gay son) mainly b/c I thought they wre a little too into the gossip and drama of the race and not as into being competitive.&nbsp; Also Patrick was one of those I&#039;m almost 20 so I know everything kids (which didn&#039;t include me b/c when I was almost 20 I did genuinely know everything.&nbsp; I have since forgotten it all)<br /><br />You know who else I liked?&nbsp; Jim and Marsha the military Dad and daughter from season 5.&nbsp; I remember being impressed cause in the first leg someone pushed Jim in the initial scramble, he messed up his leg so bad they almost didn&#039;t let him and the flight, then he carried the saide off beef (the same one Charla lugged) all on the same messed up leg.&nbsp; And no one remembers them now.

				I forgot to tape cold case so I missed this episode.&nbsp; Sounds like it was a good one.&nbsp; Glad to hear Uchenna and Joyce didn&#039;t get elminated even though they didn&#039;t make it to first place, what with the new under the gun ruling and all.&nbsp; And that article was hilarious... &quot;thats-a spicy meatball&quot;<br /><br />I could be interested in a finale party depending, as always, on things.

				My house would be decent enough to host this event.&nbsp; I am not sure how many people will want to travel to Ditmars for it though.&nbsp; <br /><br />As far as going over, I have automatically set my DVR to record all episodes and end recording an HOUR after the end.&nbsp; I hate how it keeps getting pushed back.<br /><br />I am sorta upset about Teri and Ian being eliminated, mainly because they were eliminated before the Guidos!&nbsp; I am really getting sick of the Guidos.&nbsp; They bother me beyond belief.&nbsp; I feel slightly bad about teams having such bad luck in getting from J&#039;burg to Tanzania.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t believe how many flights they had to wait for.&nbsp; Sheesh!<br /><br />I am really wanting to audition for the Race, sometime.&nbsp; However, can&#039;t even think about that for at least a year.

				I have come to actually find Charla and Mirna a bit amusing.&nbsp; They&#039;re certainly doing better than I would have ever expected, though I must admit I&#039;m always shocked by what they have Charla do - wearing armor, kicking down doors, what were they thinking?<br />I was really annoyed that it was a non elimination round.&nbsp; I was hoping to get rid of Eric and Dani once and for all.

				There&#039;s probably at least 3 more episodes b/c they still have to do a &quot;keep racing when you hit the pitstop&quot; two parter and I&#039;m assuming there&#039;s also at least one more elimination.&nbsp; I love that Danny and Oswald hit up both of the offices before the lines opened to get #1 on both waiting lists.&nbsp; And I loved Oswalds explanation to the Blondes and Eric and Danni, (or as I like to call them Team No Longer Dating After the Race is Over), &quot;We were here just as early and were also waiting in line, just a different line&quot;.<br /><br />I still stand by my earlier statement, if there is indeed a kind and benevolent God, Team ChaChaCha will win.&nbsp; Hey if they do win does that make them the second &quot;gay&quot; team to win the race?&nbsp; The other being Chip and Reichen?

				For me, I am definitely going for Team Cha Cha.&nbsp; I was actually happy to see that Eric and Dani were not elminated.&nbsp; I&#039;d rather see them lose in the final three.&nbsp; I am figuring 2 more weeks... next week would be the last elimination, and then back-to-back episodes the following week to conclude the season.<br /><br />Charla and Mirna actually started to amuse me as well last night.&nbsp; I also liked how they were all saying &quot;bad Karma&quot; about the blondies for yielding when it was not necessary.
