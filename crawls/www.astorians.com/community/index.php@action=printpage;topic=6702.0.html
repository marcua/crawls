				All this talk of arcade games in the Pizza Palace thread has me reminiscing about the video game parlors of the 80s and 90s.&nbsp; Do they still exist anywhere (maybe Las Vegas or Atlantic City?).&nbsp; What were people&#039;s favorite games?&nbsp; Have you found them in a playable format for your computer?<br />I always preferred Qix - where you partitioned off sections while a line creature moved about.&nbsp; If it hit you, you were dead.<br />Centipede, Donkey Kong, Space Invaders, Galaga (sp?) - so many good games.<br />I never cared for Dragon&#039;s Lair - too many Dirk the Daring (the lead character in the game) references in high school.

				Great topic!&nbsp; It seems so long ago that I was at the local pizza joint or 7/11, crushing people in pin ball.&nbsp; I almost missed my flight out of Minneapolis because I was setting records and wowing the bystanders with my skills at the Adams Family pin ball game.<br /><br />I suck at video games, in general.&nbsp; I was fairly decent at Galaxa and tried real hard at Pac Man, but I never mastered either.<br /><br />Do any of the old school Astorians remember arcades in the neighborhood?&nbsp; If so, what were they like?&nbsp; <br /><br />

				My memories are of video arcades in both Georgia and California (I went to Jr. High School in San Francisco).&nbsp; The boardwalk at Santa Cruz had some amazing big arcades and we had a bunch of smaller ones in the various malls on the Southside of Atlanta.<br /><br />Did Astoria have video game parlors?&nbsp; Are there stand alone video games anywhere (I think there are some at Boston Pizza on Broadway).

				I was the Queen of Ms Pacman in Jackson Hts.<br />I was also the best chick player for Street Fighter and Mortal Combat (once they went 32 bit i sucked ass). AND i wasn&#039;t the girl who always picked the one token girl character. i usually hated them (and the girls that picked them in their sad attempt to be one of the boys...i was an honest to god tomboy)<br />i miss my sega master system...i used to have an emulator on my old computer. but that compaq was a piece of s___ and died...and i have no idea where i got the emulator.<br />I used to go out to main street on the Q66 with my brother (he had to go with me since i was older) to a video game parlour. otherwise we played at local pizza joints. i think i played a few times at the pizza palace. <br />John got me one of those little joystick game boxes that has ms pacman. he plays pole position on it.<br />oh what was the other game i played.....the one where you slid a bar back and forth to knock a ball up to these tiles and you had to clear all the tiles to advance. in video parlour form it was a sit down game and you used a roller ball to move the bar back and forth....gggrrrr i can&#039;t remember!

				Yes, Breakout, AKA Arkanoid, Alleyway, and one other that I can&#039;t remember.<br />I miss arcades, mainly because I am a pinball fanatic.&nbsp; That&#039;s one of the reasons I go to bars, to play pinball.&nbsp; I was always a big fan of any game where you got to shoot stuff with a fake gun, too.

				Breakout/Arkanoid was back then and still is to this day, my favorite arcade game ever.&nbsp; I found it approximately 2 years ago at Queens Center Mall as part of a classic video game console (the games are built into it).&nbsp; ADDICTING.<br /><br />I was also a fan of Bombjack and Rygar.&nbsp; They had those games at the corner store of 24th Street and 21st Avenue.&nbsp; I used to use slugs in the machine so I didn&#039;t actually have to use quarters.&nbsp; Devioussssss.&nbsp; Those were the days.&nbsp; :evil:&nbsp; Oh and if it had a steering wheel, I loved it.&nbsp; I used to love RC Pro AM on Nintendo (Sega? Sega Genesis?) Either way, it was awesome.<br /><br />I want to playyyyyyy!<br /><br />I admittedly also own Dance Dance Revolution.&nbsp; That, too, is addicting - also heart attack inducing.&nbsp; &nbsp;:lol:<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Just an N-7-G away is Barcade (http://www.barcadebrooklyn.com/) in Williamsburg, a bar filled with all of these old games from the &#039;80s (and a good beer selection)! I haven&#039;t seen many old video games here in Astoria. The laundrymat on 31st St and 24th Ave has had Galaga and Ms Pac Man, but I think they have newer arcade games now. <br /><br />I really liked joust...

				Hands down, Galaga was my favorite. Still is.<br /><br />I remember going to the video game room at the Nathan&#039;s (then Roy Rogers) on Astoria Blvd. (where the Burger King is now). There was also a pizza place on the corner of 33rd St. and 30th Avenue that had games in the back, so did John&#039;s, the candy store/soda fountain next door. I must have spent a fortune in quarters between those two places.

				Every time I go to Barcade I find myself dropping like $17 into the Rampage machine.&nbsp; They do have lots of great, old games.&nbsp; I think that every pre-1990 game discussed in this thread is represented, from joust to dig dug to smash tv to ms pac man to tapper to super mario bros. It&#039;s a pretty good bar, and their beer selection is really nice.&nbsp; If you take the G to metropolitan it&#039;s like a 4 block walk.
