				Me and two of my friends were were assaulted by a group of eight young men on the corner of Broadway and 34th street on June 10th at approximately 1:00am. The attackers used homophobic and racial slurs before confronting and attacking us.&nbsp; The attackers seemed to be of European descent except one, who was of Asian descent.<br /><br />Once we escaped the scuffle we were chased down the block by one of the guys wielding a baseball bat. My friend was struck in the head with the bat and fell into the street. His cell phone and eyeglasses were destroyed.&nbsp; We ran to the St. James Deli on the corner of 34th ave and 34th street but were refused entrance to the deli by the clerk only to be told “This is your fight.&nbsp; They will destroy the place.” Because of this, my friend was again struck with the bat. <br /><br />It is completely disgusting how something of this nature could happen in our neighborhood - and how the St. James Deli could be so irresponsible. I&#39;ve lived here for 5 years and have never experienced anything like this.<br /><br />If you or anyone you know has any further information, please email astoriahatecrime@gmail.com. All information will be kept confidential.<br /><br />Thank you...<br /><br />

				First of all please tell me you filed a police report. Did your friend go to the hospital after being struck?<br /><br />Second, I&#39;m really disgusted and upset at the St. James Deli. I&#39;ll never be going there in my lifeteime, nor will I recommend it to anyone.<br /><br />Third, I wonder if these kids were Astorians or if they were just out looking for trouble. Hard to know.

				Hey there,<br /><br />A police report was filed. My friend was taken to Mt. Sinai hospital and got stitches in his head.<br /><br />It all started because they were taunting us as we walked by. My roommate is black and they called him a n**** numerous times. He stood up for himself but didn&#39;t hit anyone- it was all words. It seemed more like they were being arrogant kids who were defining their &#39;turf&#39;.<br />I guess they didnt like that my friend stood up for himself. Most of them attacked me, I guess because I was the biggest of the three of us and I was unable to really fight back - was mostly defending myself. Thankfully the other guy we were with had an umbrella and he was able to beat them off of us. But both he and my friend who got hit with the bat were bleeding in the end.<br /><br />While the verbal argument was happening, one guy was on the phone with a friend of theirs - who they were apparently waiting for - and we heard him say &quot;bring the bat&quot;.<br /><br />We live right by the St. James. Its really upsetting how they reacted in the whole situation.

				I can&#39;t believe something like this would happen here either.&nbsp; Last night, the singer Kevin Aviance was beaten in Manhattan by a group yelling anti-gay slurs.&nbsp; He will be unable to perform in the pride parade next week due to his injuries.&nbsp; &nbsp;They caught them though and are charging them with 1st degree assault.&nbsp; Have the police caught any of your attackers?<br />http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060611/ap_on_en_mu/singer_beaten

				Wow that is so disturbing. I am so sorry that this happened to you and your friends.&nbsp; I hope they catch the morons who did this. I for one will never frequent the St. James deli again- and I will make sure to tell my friends not to as well. I can&#39;t believe they wouldn&#39;t help you!!&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;It just makes me sick when I think about it.

				Ugh, this is absolutely horrible! I hope to god they get the trash that did this. This s___ has been going on for awhile now and nothing is ever done.<br /><br />I live a block up from where this incident happened and I&#39;ve definitely noticed a large shift&nbsp; in this neighborhood over the past year. At night I can see (and hear) the roaming gangs of teens and young adults that stomp up and down the streets, usually stopping to hang out on stoops on my block where they continue to yell and drink all night. (We&#39;ve called 311 many times, but no one has ever come.) On Tuesday night, we were awoken around 3am by a gang of 20-somethings that were drunkenly running up and down the block screaming &quot;Faggot! Homo!&quot; at the top of their lungs. Weekend nights, when my boyfriend and I are coming home from a night out, we usually have to make an effort to avoid the gangs of people that hang out in front of those seedy bars and tend to harass everyone that walks past.&nbsp; In fact, I feel downright unsafe walking on Broadway alone at night now. This morning, coming home alone around 3:30am, I got off the N train, looked up Broadway, noticed the huge crowds and decided to just sacrifice $5 and take a car service home...5 blocks. In all my years of living in Astoria, this is the first I&#39;ve EVER had to do that. And it makes me sad. <br /><br />The police presence in this area, especially on Broadway and on Steinway, has doubled recently. Many of the little kids that lived around here when I first moved to the area, have grown up to be mini-thugs. A neighbor told me the anger and violence is rising because their neighborhood is changing and their families are being forced out. :roll: Whatever the case, if this summer gets worse than the past few weeks have been around here, I&#39;m afraid this will be my last year in Astoria.

				I too am sorry that this happened to you and your friends, Joe.&nbsp; Seems like any economic sympathy I was gonna feel for St. James deli after the soon-to-open adjacent C-Town goes on line just magically evaporated.&nbsp; It indeed is ridiculous for a 24/7 dinky deli, whose only reason for continued existance is to be part of the neighborhood, to turn down it&#39;s responsibility of protecting part of the neighborhood.<br /><br />We lie to ourselves that this is some sort of muticultural landscape in lower Astoria.&nbsp; Really, we are all balkanized little tribal enclaves.&nbsp; I think it most striking that one white guy and two people of color can&#39;t get refuge at a mexican deli.&nbsp; Sad.

				I&#39;d suggest finding out who the owner of the St. James Deli is and contact them to see if they endorse the offensive behavior of their clerk. <br /><br />Oh, and if this happens again, I&#39;d suggest barging into the bodega, regardless of the clerk. They do have surveillance cameras. <br /><br />This is indeed a horrible event, and I certainly wish you and the police the best of luck in tracking down the perps.

				That is terrible!&nbsp; I am really sorry to hear.&nbsp; I never heard of incidents such as this.&nbsp; I have been in the neighborhood for over 11 years.&nbsp; <br /><br />Although I recall back in 1983, Astoria was not that diverse.&nbsp; I wanted to move here then with a friend who was African American, however, no real estate agent would work with us.&nbsp; It was pretty bad.&nbsp; I didn&#39;t move into this town until 15 years later.&nbsp; <br /><br />The storeowner was at fault, Did you report it to the police.&nbsp; The local precinct is on Astoria Blvd going East, right near the Grand central parkway exit and on the Astoria blvd N train stop.

				So sorry to hear about you and your friends getting hurt last night.&nbsp; <br /><br />Maybe we should consider doing something as a group.&nbsp; Like attending a community meeeting or volunteer patrol or something.&nbsp; I&#39;d hate to think of things getting worse.

				I live right at 34th and Bway - I found a notice outside my building saying that there had been a hate crime and asking any witnesses to contact a certain email.&nbsp; I saw a cop car outside and my first impression was that the cops were putting up the notices but I&#39;m not 100% sure of it - didn&#39;t seem to be on NYPD letterhead. <br /><br />Anyway, anything that we can do to make Astoria a safer, more tolerant, better community seems like a worthwhile thing to do.

				JoeP, I must add my sorrow and disappointment to that already expressed by the other members of our little community here. I am sorry not only for your physical injuries but of course for your psychological trauma as well. No one has the right to make you feel fearful or hated in your own neighborhood.<br />&nbsp;<br />I pretty much live on the aformentioned corner (on 34th street, past the Dunkin Donuts a few houses toward 31st ave) and I can vouch for the fact that this particluar corner on Broadway has gotten <strong>out of control </strong> in the past few months. Its steadily getting worse and no amount of 911-calling seems to remedy this decline in safety. <br /><br />My husband and I have also called the local precinct directly (<strong>114 Precinct: 718.626.9311</strong>), when, upon multiple instances we look out the window onto the street and see brawling teens, fistfighting, yelling, taunting passersby, kicking parked cars, etc. We have left for work in mornings where we see <em>blood</em> splattered all over the pavement in front of our building. <br /><br />There is a real problem developing. The cops always eventually come but usually its too late, after the fact. We really should use a collective voice to tell these craven hoodlums that they are not above the law just because they are frustrated that their families are being pushed out by hipsters or whatever. Who cares? There&#39;s no excuse for this kind of violence.<br /><br />We should start by attending the community meetings (the ones upstairs from the Quinn Funeral Home on Broadway) to figure out what a course of action should be.<br /><br />

				I live right near there as well - on 34th Between B&#39;way and 31st ave.&nbsp; I&#39;ve had to call the cops on too many occasions at this point because of fights that happen in front of or near my building at the 3-4am mark.&nbsp; <br /><br />Wait - I&#39;m saying exactly what my wife just said...<br /><br />But to add - just the other day, Friday actually, we were walking towards 30th Ave on 34th Street and there was a group of Euros on a stoop talking about how one of them started a fight with &quot;some effin&#39; n****&quot; and how he didn&#39;t care how many of them there were, etc, etc.&nbsp; They were definitely Euro...it&#39;s possible that they were not Greek though.&nbsp; <br /><br />There seems to be a major issue with these guys - and many other like them - and any African American that&#39;s happens to stroll by.&nbsp; There&#39;s some major entitlement and racism in that group that&#39;s scarier, I think, than Fordham Road and Grand Concourse.<br /><br />One incident in particular was the opposite of all this - 3 African Americans males and one female jumped 2 Euro dudes.&nbsp; We called the cops but it was too late, they all split up.&nbsp; The white guys were TRASHED and one of them didn&#39;t even realize that he was standing next to his passed-out buddy that was sprawled out on the ground.&nbsp; Someone from another apartment building came to the window and told the guy to check on his buddy - the guy at the window happened to be black.<br /><br />Guess where it went from there?&nbsp; The Euro&#39;s started with &quot;See what your bothers did?&nbsp; Huh?&nbsp; Effin&#39; N****!!&nbsp; See what you people did?&quot; and so on.&nbsp; Really sad and disgusting that Astoria really has such a ridiculous race problem.<br /><br />But in generally it seems that the trouble makers are the random male European guys.

I mean, this is a pretty diverse neighborhood in other ways. Lots of Arabs, people from Colombia and other parts of Latin America, people from the Balkans... I find it striking how well the racist elements of the Greek community (which, of course, is by no means all of the Greek community) seem to get along with other groups that in other places would definitely be targets. Just goes to show how cultural racism is; it&#39;s not merely xenophobia, but is something very specific to a particular society.<br /><br />OK, sorry, that was a bit academic... On a practical level, contacting Vallone Jr. seems like a good idea. It might also be worth a concise, clear letter to the editor of the Times, letting them know about these incidents which might not otherwise be noted.<br />

				Peter Vallone, Jr. is also the Chair of the Public Safety Committee, and he&#39;s very concerned about crime, so he&#39;s the ideal person to contact.&nbsp; I live right across the street from where the attack took place and it&#39;s appalling that the 114th Precinct did so little.&nbsp; I<br />&nbsp;think a mass turnout to complain about this attack and the dangerous conditions on Broadway at the next precinct council meeting is in order.

				Don&#39;t know how Vallone or any politician will do much good. They are connected with the precinct very, very, well and through Astoria Civic, UCCA, and the precinct council they are all joined at the hip. Read in the paper that they always have talks from the police on crime. Does it do any good?<br /><br />Besides, didn’t somebody state that a smiling Vallone Jr. was in the paper for Soma’s opening?<br /><br />Remember it’s the powerful patronage machine, through its control over the media (and the marketing our image), that brought a lot of this trash into the neighborhood. In turn, these are the constituents that will return the same people into office over and over again. <br /><br />The last thing the machine wants to hear is quality of life issues like sanitation, noise, crime, and overdevelopment. Puts it at odds with its constituency.<br /><br />After all, if you do not like things, you are supposed to move away. Can’t fight City Hall, now can we?<br /><br />Now with the World Cup, Broadway should really get juiced up.<br /><br />

				I think its still worth it to try and make it to these meetings... the status quo relies on complacency and the inevitable feelings of powerlessness. Of course Vallone is a chump, we should not believe otherwise. He&#39;s a politician. But that shouldn&#39;t stop us from trying to raise awareness about the situation in general. If anything, just so more people are aware and might take caution when walking at night (god forbid you might be at Ommonia wanting some baklava one Saturday night-- you might just get jumped! so sad...). <br /><br />I will make it a point to go to the next one (thanks enigmacat for the info!)

				Vallone, Jr. is a good man and I think this is exactly the type of issue with which he&#39;d get involved.&nbsp; I&#39;ve called his office, but he is at city hall where the Public Safety Committee, which he chairs, is having a hearing.<br />The meeting tomorrow is not the Precinct Council meeting, it&#39;s a community organization.&nbsp; I&#39;m not sure what their focus is, I think more on development issues.<br />The precinct council meeting is Tuesday, June 27, 7 p.m. at Riccardo&#39;s - 21–01 24th Avenue.&nbsp; This incident and the problems at Broadway need to be raised at this meeting.

				Hi Annie -<br />I&#39;ve been to many precinct council meetings in Manhattan, but not to one in Queens, not yet anyways. &nbsp;I served as the Chief of Staff to a Manhattan City Council member for a few years and had to cover five precincts. &nbsp;<br />I haven&#39;t been to the 114th Precinct Community Council, but I&#39;m sure it works very similar to the ones in Manhattan. &nbsp;It&#39;s important for us to get a large crowd, to have people talk politely, but forcefully and to talk about not only the incident, but the problems as a whole, though we have to make sure the people who committed this attack are caught. &nbsp;As a gay man, I am horrified to have an attack like this take place in my neighborhood, let alone on my own block, especially to a close friend. &nbsp;The 114th Precinct needs to take action immediately. &nbsp;We need to make the officers understand the gravity of the situation and how concerned the neighborhood is about the entire situation. &nbsp;Broadway is becoming unsafe and if we don&#39;t take action, we could have other attacks.<br />Dirk

				Actually there was a big town hall meeting earlier this year, after those killings on Steinway Street with UCCA and Generis (sp?) taking center stage. Crime was also already discussed at the Community Board (Vallone&#39;s brother is on it) earlier this year.<br /><br />...and what happened?<br /><br />The point is you cannot carry coal to West Virginia. These people know what is going on here far better than any one of you .... and also know the stories about the 3 or 4 times the number of events that happens that never makes the papers.<br /><br />From the LICA website, this is excactly the sort of thing that I understand the LICA people are interested in. Like LICA, the 114 Civ-op is another good grassroots group to get involved in ... ... and they don&#39;t have any potential conflicts of interest or dog in any fight.<br /><br />

				Gleason -<br />Are you talking about the townhall down at the Museum of the Moving Image?&nbsp; I got there on the late side and didn&#39;t hear any discussion about crime, but maybe they talked about it earlier.<br />The community board is a place these issues could be raised, but it&#39;s not really in their purview, they review liquor licenses, sidewalk cafe applications, land use applications, street fairs, parks, street signage, etc.&nbsp; Crime and these sort of attacks need to be brought to the Police Precinct.&nbsp; I hear good things about the Civ-Op group, that would be another good venue in which to raise concerns.&nbsp; I&#39;ve never been to a LICA meeting, so I don&#39;t know what they talk about there - do they get the Commanding officer of the precinct at their meetings?

				Dirk, I couldn&#39;t agree more! Astorians should definately mobilize and make a real attempt to affect change in our own neighborhood. My corner of 34th and Broadway has always been kind of annoying (excessive litter, punks loitering, traffic accidents) but this latest incident is clearly far beyond annoyance. I&#39;ve never been to any of these meetings and I look forward to attending. Maybe we could get an informative calendar listing? Because I dont really understand the difference between all these different community groups...

				They gave us a great update on crime,&quot; former City Council Speaker Peter Vallone Sr. said of the meeting. <br /><br />In addition to his verbal report, McCarthy gave a 20-minute slide presentation on crime in the precinct and Vallone Jr., chair of the council Public Safety Committee, reported on public safety in Astoria and throughout the city. &quot;We were all very pleased with the public safety report,&quot; Vallone Sr. said. <br />

				Community Boards are created by the city charter and are appointed by the Borough President of each borough. &nbsp;They have 50 members, half appointed directly by the borough president and half in consultation with the local council member. &nbsp;Usually people stay on for sometime after being appointed, though terms are for two years. &nbsp;There is some turnover each year, but generally the elected officials recruit from local community based groups and institutions, as well as local political organizations. &nbsp;Some boards are very divided with lots of fights, others work as a body and share a dominant viewpoint. &nbsp;They are advisory and make recommendations, they have no absolute ability to stop a project, but can influence local elected officials and city and state agencies. &nbsp;They are a very grassroots level of government. &nbsp;The members give their time for free - they&#39;re all volunteers.<br />The Precinct Council is an advisory body of citizens who work with the local NYPD Police Precinct. &nbsp;These meet monthly and are a good way to make sure the officers, community affairs unit and Chief of a precinct know what&#39;s going on in the community. &nbsp;They often deal with noise issues, graffiti, attacks and similar issues - anything in which the cops or detectives get involved.<br />LICA is a community organization, like a block association from what I can see. &nbsp;It&#39;s local members organizing on issues. &nbsp;I&#39;ve been to their website before, which is well done, but never to a meeting. &nbsp; As I mentioned earlier, they seem more interested in development issues - new construction, etc. than other issues, but their statement of purpose seems open ended, and I have no idea who their leaders are, so it could be a venue to raise awareness and issues, though I don&#39;t know if the people who can directly address the problem attend or not.<br />Going to the press is a great idea - it&#39;s important to get the issue out in the media. &nbsp;Does anyone know folks at the local Queens papers? &nbsp;If you do, now would be the time to call them!

				Ahhhh.... I get it now. Thank you sooooo much, Mcdirk! These types of primers should be required reading for new people moving into a community (along with local precinct phone numbers, etc of course). Your insightful summation is totally appreciated and valued as something I could never find in the &quot;government pages&quot; of the phone book. Ha!<br /><br />Fromwhat you said, the precinct meetings might be the most relevant (in terms of getting more cops on the street ASAP and the enforcement aspect) but for the long term, more of us should attend all three types of meetings to try and clean up Astoria&#39;s streets (of both litter and hoodlums). Let&#39;s move into the planning stages if possible. This should probably include JoePocky since he is empowered to give first-hand accounts of this incident...?<br /><br />As far as troublesome bars/clubs near that corner, I have some specific opinions and can name the ones that I think (1) attract problematic [underage and/or belligerent] clientele; and (2) have already been closed on prior occassions due to some infraction; and (3) create large, anxious crowds on the sidewalks of Broadway:<br /><br />NuBar (between 32nd and 33rd?)<br />Caos (since shut down I think)<br />The Cave (next to Crystal Palace, 32nd st)<br />billiards bar upstairs (at 32nd st?)<br /><br />More weekend evenings than not, we get the streetfights spilling over from Broadway onto 34th St. <br /><br />All the merchants around there should be alerted to the problem, like Michaels Diner and Ommonia and even Uncle Georges. <span class="bbc_u">Maybe someone should print up flyers with details of the crime and pass it out to the bodegas and restaurants on Broadway. </span> If the merchants pull their weight together (in the interests of preserving their property value, say, against growing street crime), the police will definately put more patrolmen on the corners late at night. It worked for the other end of Broadway-- on Steinway!

				Caos was really awful - I would never cross on that side of the street as it always looked likely to get rowdy.&nbsp; I&#39;ve seen crowds in front of the Cave a lot, but I&#39;m usually on the Southside, so I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re unfriendly.&nbsp; There is usually a line outside NuBar and they are often loud, but they&#39;ve always had the bouncers.&nbsp; I&#39;ve felt awkward outside NuBar and hurried past many times - especially if people are yelling or arguing with their security.&nbsp; &nbsp;I like the idea of reaching out to the local restaurants, maybe they can help get the word out.&nbsp; I&#39;m not sure I can make the meeting tomorrow, but I think a discussion before the precinct council meeting is a good idea.&nbsp; We should coordinate!&nbsp; One of the victims made flyers and posted them - we need to find some of the witnesses so we can prove the case.&nbsp; There are still 8 bashers out there who have shown they are willing to use a baseball bat on people - this is scary stuff.

				Harlan has a point, though - it would be a good idea to talk to the owner and find out whether this reflects the owner&#39;s decision or an inexperience clerk who just got scared, before we vilify and boycott the crap out of them.&nbsp; :evil:<br /><br />

				Anyone concerned about this atrocity should come to the Long Island City Alliance meeting Tues. the 13th at 7:00. We&#39;re a great forum for discussion, and together, we can come up with some solutions.<br />See our website for meeting location. www.LICAlliance.org.<br />&nbsp;

				first of all i want to give my sincere appologies to the folks who endured this scary incident. i&#39;ve lived in this neighborhood for twenty years and have expereinced racism, homophobia and the self-hatred that breads it all. there&#39;s a lot one can say about this but one thing is for certain: moving away or giving up on our representatives or the social structures of our community is not the way to go. nor do i believe that carricaturing these kids, teen-gangs etc. is helpful either. bonding as a community to highlight our values and our solidarity with JoeP and his friends is the way to go.<br /><br />i support organizing a campaign to help publicize the event and rally the community around this incident. i believe that Valone, 114th and other local civic entities will be responsive provided that they are approached in a logical way. if JoeP and friends are amenable to the idea i am available to help out any way i can.....i can reach out to activist friends and find out which legal aid groups can support us and back us up......i have other contacts as well in the community <br /><br />in any case, my heartfelt solidarity goes out to everyone caught up in this storm and glad to know that you&#39;ve had hospital care and are at least recovering<br /><br />

				Hi All,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I too live on 34th and Broadway and I was just informed today of this event.&nbsp; I have lived in my apartment for 6 years and have watched the neighborhood change a lot in that time period.&nbsp; In many ways for the better, but obviously there are also new problems.<br />I would like to suggest to everyone that you talk to your land lords about these problems and your concerns.&nbsp; Many of the land lords in Astoria own several buildings, not just yours, and have a vested interest in keeping them profitable. Not only that, many of them have local connections that could be very beneficial to the cause.&nbsp; I am not able to make the meeting tonight at the Cafe Bar, but I called my land lord and left her a message about it, hopefully she will attend.&nbsp; I know that she is very unhappy about all the bars opening on Broadway. Anyway, hope that it goes well.&nbsp; I would love to hear the outcome and hope to attend future meetings.

				This sucks. You should not be subjected to intimidation and ignorant bias like that. Please check out the newer thread on Anti-Hate Crime Activism and come to the next meeting! I&#39;m sure there are a lot of people that would be interested in listening to your accounts.

				How about posting &quot;Boycott (name of) Deli&quot; (that refused to help) everywhere? Why not cost them business. If they are not supporting the neighborhood, let&#39;s take our business elsewhere.<br /><br />

At about 5:45 a.m. the following morning, June 11, another gay man in his mid 20s was harassed on a Queens-bound N train, followed off the train at a station at 36th Avenue and 31st Street, shoved down the stairs, and kicked about the head. That victim suffered a possible head fracture.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />All of this violence, the most serious of which gave Aviance a broken jaw that will be wired shut for up to two weeks, has officials at the AVP concerned. Anti-violence advocates often find that anti-LGBT attacks spike at times of greatest visibility for the community, whether in celebration or on the defensive.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Data collected by the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs, of which the city’s AVP is a lead member, noted that as anti-gay political rhetoric heated up in response to progress in the same-sex marriage movement in the couple of years leading up to the 2004 election, reported instances of homophobic attacks escalated.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />On the other hand, June, a time of numerous large public gay pride gatherings, is typically the high-water mark for anti-gay violence in New York. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Clarence Patton, AVP’s executive director, said that his group will lead a rally and march in the Village on Saturday to draw attention to the issue and to warn LGBT New Yorkers to use sensible precautions this Pride season. He hopes that the event will make clear that anti-gay attacks occur citywide and target many types of victims.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />“Kevin’s attack happened in the East Village and for our sanity we want to take certain things for granted, that there are places safe for us,” Patton said. “We’ve heard a lot about what happened to Kevin, and that’s appropriate, but we have struggled to get attention on the other cases. A lot of people know who Kevin is and that’s a media hook. It was Manhattan versus not Manhattan. But in missing the other incidents, we lose the piece about the frequency of this type of incident overall.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />AVP tentatively plans to hold the rally at 14th Street and First Avenue, roughly a block from where Aviance was assaulted, at 2 p.m. Saturday, with a march to Christopher Park, adjacent to Sheridan Square, at 3. To confirm the final arrangements, call AVP at 212- 714-1184.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />The 1:30 a.m. attack on Aviance Saturday came as he was walking west from the Phoenix Bar on 13th Street between First Avenue and Avenue A. Dressed in black shorts, hooded T, and boots, “boy’s clothes” as his publicist Len Evans described, Aviance was followed by what police now say were four young men, who repeatedly shouted the word “faggot” and tossed a variety of items from the street at him. As the four men ganged up in an attack on him, Aviance lost consciousness and was later helped to Beth Israel Medical Center at First Avenue and 16th Street by a stranger on the scene.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Aviance spent two and a half days in the hospital, where he was treated for a wide array of bruises and his broken jaw. Evans expressed concern that the healing of his jaw might impair a face that has proved remarkably photogenic in Aviance’s performance career. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Born Eric Snead in Richmond, Virginia, in 1968, Aviance got his start in the Washington, D.C., club scene; in a 2003 interview with Gay City News, he said, “If it wasn’t for me there wouldn’t be a club scene in D.C. We did edgy parties, which were very New York.” By the mid-1990s, he left Washington for the city which he had always been looking to evoke in the first place, and became known as “the hardest working performer in New York club land.” Often appearing in tandem with DJ giants such as Junior Vasquez, Aviance soon emerged as an iconic gay figure around town.

The alleged attackers are Akino George, a 20-year-old African American who lives at 1465 Townsend Avenue in the Bronx; Jarell Sears, a 20-year-old African American who lives at 117 Brookdale Avenue in Newark; Gregory Archie, an 18-year-old Latino who lives at 346 East 21st Street in Manhattan; and Gerard Johnson, a 16-year-old African American of 440 East 20th Street, also in Manhatttan.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />All four were arraigned on charges of first-degree assault as a hate crime, and held on $25,000 bail. None of the men entered a plea and they will return to court on June 16. Each could face up to 25 years in jail if convicted.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />The early morning Saturday attack in Astoria began as three gay men—all in their mid 20s, at least two of whom live in the neighborhood, and two of them white, the third a light-skinned black man—were walking down 35th Avenue near 36th Street on their way home from a bar. They were approached by four young men, who began to harass them with taunts of “faggot” and “n_____.” As the confrontation heated up, one of the assailants used his cell phone to call a friend to bring a baseball bat. Minutes later, a white SUV arrived with three or four more young men, one of whom proceeded to beat one of the victims, 25, with a bat, causing a head wound that required hospitalization—at the Upper East Side’s Mount Sinai Hospital—and numerous stitches.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Among the seven or eight attackers, all but one were white, with the other being Asian.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Although police have done two canvasses of the neighborhood with the two victims whose injuries did not require hospitalization, they have no solid leads in the case. The fact that the SUV arrived so quickly after the cell call suggests that at least some of the assailants live in or near Astoria.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />To date, the victims have chosen to remain anonymous.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />According to a 24-year-old gay man who also lives in Astoria, he was riding the N train home early Sunday morning and was confronted just before his stop at 36th Avenue and 31st Street by a man who shouted, “Are you a faggot?” When the victim got off the train, the assailant asked, “Is this where all the faggots get off?” and followed, pushing him down several steps in the elevated station, before kicking him in the face as he lay on the ground.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />The victim, who like his assailant, is white, suffered injuries to his right eye, his right ear, and his lip, and may have suffered a fracture on the side of his head. The assailant, who was unknown to the victim, was last seen heading southbound on 31st Street before turning eastbound on 37th Avenue.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />The attacker was described as a white man, about five-foot, eight and 150 pounds, with a light, clear complexion and brown hair with a crew cut. Given the proximity to the assault the previous day, police have not ruled out that the perpetrator might have been from the first gang of attackers, but that is not considered a strong likelihood.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;!--<br />google_ad_client = &quot;pub-5121976262849259&quot;;<br />google_ad_width = 468;<br />google_ad_height = 60;<br />google_ad_format = &quot;468x60_as&quot;;<br />google_ad_type = &quot;text&quot;;<br />google_ad_channel =&quot;&quot;;<br />//--&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				I&#39;m really sorry to hear about the violence that your party received.&nbsp; That shouldn&#39;t happen anywhere but especially not in peaceful Astoria.<br /><br />I moved here from Harlem about 4 years ago and I have always remarked at how safe, clean and &#39;neighborhoody&#39; Astoria is.&nbsp; I don&#39;t think these few random acts can necessarily be labelled an epidemic but you have to understand what&#39;s causing that level of trouble in that one specific area.&nbsp; Namely, the cluster of nightclubs, usually catering to younger audiences, that have sprung up over the last few years on Broadway from 31st Street to 34th Street.<br /><br />I drove by the other night and there must have been some &#39;End of School Jam&#39; going on at one of the clubs and the street was filled with loud, rambuncious 15-year olds dressed like 19-year olds.<br /><br />Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love kids, but when you get more than 30 teenagers in the same cluster without adequate parental or authoratative supervision and add in the whole &#39;boys and girls&#39; element to it, you&#39;re asking for trouble.<br /><br />It&#39;s a dilemma because those clubs, and the commerce they attract for local businesses, is important but how do we keep it all safe and sound???<br /><br />Maybe the meeting will provide some answers.<br /><br />

This occurred at approximately 0110 (1:10 a.m.) hours at the intersection of Broadway and 34th Street. The victim sustained a deep laceration to his head and forehead. The perpetrators fled the location and a canvass of the surrounding area was conducted with negative results. Upon further investigation, this was believed to be an anti-gay incident and the Hate Crime Task Force took control of the case (carried under Complaint #2006- 114-5992).<br /><br />As a result of the investigation, on January 10, 2007 at approximately 2145 hours (9:45 p.m.), Detective Caban of the Hate Crime Task Force apprehended three individuals for this incident. Their pedigree information is as follows:<br /><br />+Daniel Shamenti, m/u, 22 years of age, of 175 Lincoln Ave., Albany NY- ARREST#Q07602121.<br /><br />+Hector Dika, m/u, 21 years of age, of 34-07 36th Ave., Astoria, (resident of the 114th Pct.)- ARREST#Q07602076.<br /><br />+Armando Uka, m/u, 20 years of age, of 70-06 Woodside Ave., Queens Village (resident of the 105th Pct.)- ARREST#Q07602066.<br /><br />The perpetrators did yell anti-gay and antiblack epithets at the victim, along with several others, which resulted in a fight, at which time they proceeded to punch, kick and strike the victim with a baseball bat. The other victims who were menaced were able to flee the scene.<br /><br />This appalling incident was a hate crime targeting gay men and was solved with tenacity. I would like to take this time to commend the dedicated and thorough work of the Hate Crime Task Force. I maintained a rapport with the investigators throughout and can assure you much time and effort was expended into bringing this matter to a successful conclusion. <br />Respectfully, <br />Brian McCarthy <br />Inspector <br />114th Police Precinct <br />Commanding Officer<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				It is good that they caught three of eight, but not good enough. I also agree that it is sad that one of the suspects was from our neighborhood.<br /><br />As for posting the address of a suspect, I remember learning something about this in school. They list the name and address to avoid slandering the wrong individual. (ie: if someone else in the community has the same name)

He was returned to court on January 26th before Criminal Court Judge Mullings where an Order of Protection was issued for the victim(s), and was returned to jail. His next appearance will be on March 1st.<br /><br />I was unable to find any information on Daniel Shamenti. Apparently the Gazette spelled his name incorrectly. Daniel Shameti was arraigned on January 12th before Judge Zayas in the Queens Criminal Court under <strong>Docket 2007QN002302</strong>. The District attorney asked for $20,000 bail (of which $15,000 must be cash). He was unable to post bail. He was returned to court on January 26th before Criminal Court Judge Mullings where an Order of Protection was issued for the victim(s), and was returned to jail. His next appearance will be on March 1st.<br /><br />I found a fourth person arrested not listed in the article. Brian Ewald, 20 years old, was arraigned on January 12th before Judge Zayas in the Queens Criminal Court under <strong>Docket 2007QN002305</strong>. The District attorney asked for $25,000 bail (of which $20,000 must be cash). He was unable to post bail. He was returned to court on January 26th before Criminal Court Judge Mullings where an Order of Protection was issued for the victim(s), and was able to post bond. His next appearance will be on March 1st.<br /><br />I am quite certain that the 3 that are being held on Rikers Island are being questioned frequently. Sooner or later they will give up the names of the others. That is, of course, if they even know who they were. This was a crime of opportunity. They may not all have been together. There is also the possibility that Brian Ewald struck a deal to plea in exchange for either testimony or additional information.<br /><br />They have each been assigned a Public Defender.<br /><br />Let&#39;s allow the system to work.

				wow, I just finished reading all the pages of this thread. I&#39;m so sorry to the original poster to whom this happened to. Astoria has felt so safe and homey to me, though I have seen my share of douche bags on Broadway near Nu bar on weekend nights. It is a shame that today people would still act so viciously towards one another. I hope that the detention of the few who are in custody have brought some closure, and I hope the rest are apprehended soon. I also have to say that seeing everyone rally in support to spread awareness and indeed, try to make a change rather than just give up to the seemingly unchangeable politics of it all makes me happy. <br /><br />I will be spreading the word to discourage ANYONE from going to St James Deli, and I have passed this thread onto some of my friends in the community to pass along.

				I am so glad that Bravo opened on the corner.&nbsp; Hopefully the deli is losing business to the new supermarket.&nbsp; If anyone hasn&#39;t been there, they seem to make a point of having enough cashiers available so there never seems to be more than 1 or 2 people on a line.&nbsp; No reason to go to that deli...not that there ever was for me.

				Just to update some of NYC MacUsers&#39; info:<br /><br />The four defendants were charged with 6 to 8 counts, ranging from C felony assault (assault with a weapon charged as a hate crime) to A misdemeanor possession of a weapon. They have all since been released on bail. Some have retained private counsel, others continue to be represented by members of the 18B panel. NYC doesn&#39;t have a &quot;public defender&quot; -- the majority of cases in NYC get picked up by the Legal Aid Society (I&#39;m a LAS attorney), a private non-profit that contracts with the city to provide indigent defense. Not sure why LAS didn&#39;t pick up any of the defendants, unless there was a conflict of interest.<br /><br />Anyway, to check the status of this or any other criminal case, go to WebCrims at the NYS Court website:<br /><br />http://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/webcrim_attorney/Login<br /><br />Log in as a guest and go to case searches. You can search by name or docket number.<br /><br />And to check the status of any Rikers Island inmate, go to the inmate lookup on the Department of Corrections website:<br /><br />http://www.nyc.gov/html/doc/html/home/home.shtml<br /><br />I&#39;ve lived in Astoria on and off throughout my entire life and this is only the second crime in the neighborhood that has had me totally creeped out -- the first was when I went to arraign a robbery that happened a couple houses down from my own. I&#39;m glad they caught these guys, but it&#39;s only half the battle. Even though the top charge is a C felony, the odds of there being a finding to that count is pretty slim unless the case is taken to trial -- it will inevitably be pled down to the E felony or the A misdemeanor and the perps will either get 5 years probation or a light jail sentence. Sad, but all too unfortunately true.<br /><br />

I cringe at the thought that these kids are back on our streets. <br /><br />What kind of say will the victim(s) have in any plea deal? I was burglarized last summer and the District Attorney&#39;s office sent a car to pick me up and take me to the court to discuss a plea. I gave a lot of thought to it, and had a list of criteria that I wanted to go along with any plea. I did not meet with either the defendant or his representative prior to sentencing until all my requests were agreed upon. Frankly, I was scared to death of the whole mess, but I was guided through the whole process by an angel from the DA&#39;s office. Will these victims be afforded the same respect I was given in determining the disposition of these cases or will they be handled differently because of the charges?

If you think there&#39;s only a 1-in-20 chance of getting arrested for (say) beating up someone on the street, it&#39;s not going to matter much to you whether the crime is worth 10 years in the pokey or a slap in the wrist, as it&#39;s not going to happen to you. (Especially if you&#39;re 19 and therefore immortal.) So I&#39;m very heartened that they caught these guys (assuming they&#39;re the right guys, of course), as the arrests themselves are a major factor in reducing future crimes in the future... Thumbs up for good police work.<br />

Not sure which system is better, though.

Can the cross-examination still be based on the victim(s) ability to positively identify them? Certainly there can be no justification in claiming that they were in any way provoked.<br /><br />Aren&#39;t these types of crimes handled differently? I thought that the Bias Crime Unit had their name changed to Hate Crimes because these were considered special circumstances crimes, that they were handled differently by the courts and that the penalties were greater. Is there any way that the community-at-large can make any difference in this/these cases? (Is there any way to tell if the 4 of them might be tried together or individually?) I feel certain that if the victim(s) were to post in this thread that they wanted community-based support, in any way, there would be an outpouring. <br /><br />I, for one, will puke if they get a lousy fine and a few hours of community service that does not specifically relate to the LGBT community. I am usually a real bleeding heart, but not in this type of crime.
