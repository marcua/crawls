				Has anyone that lives around Ditmars seen this new buliidng that has been being built for the past year or so?<br />Its red and beige (i kid you not) and has about 5 stories. It faces the municipal parking lot on 32nd street between 23rd Ave and Ditmars. (next to the train tressle).<br /><br />In any case i have been peeved for a few months because it seems that the exterior construction has been completed, but they have forgotten <b>the railing for the top floor balcony</b>.<br />I am more than slightly alarmed because i can&#39;t imange anyone living there with no balcony.<br />are they just expecting someone to temp fate? Or are they waiting to see if anyone complains?<br />There are sliding doors and everthing, but no railing.<br />Having to walk past it every morning, I hope each time that finnaly they would have put one up, but after 2 months of being personally peeved to no avail, i ask you, fellow readers.<br /><br />WHATS THE DEAL? <br /><br />I&#39;ll attach a photo tonight.<br /><br />

				I think I know the building, but it&#39;s on 33rd, not 32nd.&nbsp; 32nd doesn&#39;t go through between 23rd and Ditmars.

				Well the building isn&#39;t done yet.&nbsp; I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll get around to putting up a railing before letting people live there.&nbsp; Perhaps it just hasn&#39;t been ordered yet, or they just haven&#39;t gotten around to it.&nbsp; Wait until the building is done, and if the railing still isn&#39;t up yet, then complain.&nbsp; &nbsp;Until then, get some sleep.&nbsp; :-)

				I think they&#39;ll have to put up a balcony - it does look odd without one (and dangerous too).

				I think the more important issue is that building looks hideous.<br /><br />I like new construction, but that&#39;s BAD new construction.

				I&#39;ve noticed several instances in that area of people knocking down the lovely old rowhouses, and building hideous new monstrosities in their place.&nbsp; *Why?*<br />I imagine it&#39;s because they think they can get more money for units in the hideous new monstrosties, but it&#39;s so awful, and it breaks up the nice long, uninterrupted stretches of lovely old rowhouses.

				That actually isn&#39;t a new building. There was a fire in the house that was there before, but there was so much damage that they tore it down and built this GAWDAWFUL MONSTROSITY&nbsp; instead. (Whew!!!) I actually see it only if I happen to park in the lot. :killme: :ugly: :yuck:

Our apartment has a lot of thigns that need fxing. There&#39;s one near me that&#39;s getting total overhaul, gutted and everything. And another on my block is a disaster, essentially abandonded since the owner died last summer.<br /><br />It&#39;s likely a lot cheaper to knock down the old houses and rebuild the newer ones. I&#39;m no expert on home construction, but I get a sense that the new ones are cheaply made and probably cost less than having to redo old masory, re-roof, walls, new plumbing, windows and on and on.<br /><br />It&#39;s a shame because I happen to prefer the older homes. I believe it gives the neighborhood character.

				I think it&#39;s rare to find construction these days that isn&#39;t cheaply made.&nbsp; Even the new coops and condos sprouting up all over this city seem to fit that description.&nbsp; And they all use electric heaters now, stupidest decision ever.

				Older buildings do not have a lifespan, as such, but reflect the way they are maintained by their owners. Europe is full older buildings (where they were not destroyed by war) that are central to their charm. Think Prague, Venice, et al.<br /><br />Having spent a few summers as a kid working for a builder who custom-built homes one at a time, I can state that the older construction techniques were far more solid than the cheap composites used today. When commenting on the Levittown-type tract housing of the 50s, he would tell me those homes were built to sell, not to live in.<br /><br />The mentality of the 1800s and early 1900s was to construct homes that would stand the test of time. Homes were built for the owner&#39;s children - and their children - to move into.<br /><br />Today, the world is different. People are more mobile. Like global warming, an exploding population is something that is self-inflicted, and the machinery to housing this problem is designed to put a roof over peoples&#39; heads as quickly, and as cheaply, as possible.<br /><br />Another problem is the utter failure for the city to encourage owner-occupied housing. You can walk down a block and almost point out the few remaining homes that have the owner on site. A community with absentee property owners is a community in trouble. Not only are services over burdened, but the property is allowed to decay. The housing, once a home, becomes a cash cow.<br /><br />The new housing will, in short order, become a slum. One only needs to walk around Elmhurst and downtown Flushing to see structures built in the past 40 years ready for the wrecking ball. <br /><br />Which starts the vicious cycle all over again. An exploding population and shorter lifespan of buildings causes development to run on a faster and faster treadmill.<br /><br />But I guess that is the entire point, eh?<br />
