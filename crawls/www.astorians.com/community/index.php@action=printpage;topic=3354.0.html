				So I have a rant and this seems like the place to bitch or so.<br /><br />For the first time in 5 years I live in a building with neighbors and stuff.&nbsp; But I am confused.&nbsp; Why is it that when I met the couple across the hall and introduced myself in a very nice way, &quot;Hi My name is Jake and I just moved across the hall&quot; and the &quot;bitch&quot; said &quot;yeah and?&quot; <br /><br />Now I know my friends on Boston made really good friends with the couple across the hall and actually the couple broke up and the girl is living with them now but why don&#39;t I know anyone in my building?&nbsp; I am a pretty friendly guy.&nbsp; Some ppl who know me will agree.&nbsp; I don&#39;t need to be Seinfeld/Kramer with these people but I would like a responce when I say hello and maybe someone to tell me if my apartment is being robbed.&nbsp; The building isn&#39;t huge 20 units on one side and 20 on the other.&nbsp; I know NO ONE except the super who is really sweet.&nbsp; <br /><br />It is really silly to live in a building and not know anyone.&nbsp; Any suggestions?&nbsp; I am very bold so don&#39;t hold back.&nbsp; <br /><br />(spell check completed)<br /><br />PS I have been here 4 months already

				I wouldn&#39;t worry about them.&nbsp; Some people are friendly, others aren&#39;t.&nbsp; They don&#39;t seem like they are worth getting to know.&nbsp; You&#39;ll probably find others in the building who are based on the odds.

				Yeah, sounds like a weird encounter with someone who&#39;s being hostile for no reason. Some people are just rude, and some not used to having any interaction with their neighbors.<br /><br />I&#39;m not best buddies with any of my neighbors, but have an exchange-hellos-and-smile relationship with most - I don&#39;t get beyond that stage, which is ok with me.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Sad. This whole thread is very sad.<br /><br />Not that anyone asked, but this is what I would do.<br /><br />Pick a day, or evening, weekday or weekend—your choice—post the building with flyers. Nothing fancy, mind you, just plain and simple black and white. <br />Let&#39;s All Have A Meet and Greet<br />EACH OTHER<br />Day of Week, Time of Day–Time of Day<br />Pick a Common Area of Your Building<br /><br />Come with a glass of iced tea. Yes I said tea—okay, cola—nothing alcoholic, not yet. If/when a few people show up, be prepared to invite them to your apartment, and have a very simple spread for them. Potato chips and a dip would be fine. Let them suggest going back to their place to bring over something more substantial. Perhaps even have a couple of menus that you can order from. <br /><br />Yep, this is Mohammed going to the mountain, but what the hell, It serves the same purpose . . . people get to know one-another on a first-name basis. Enough of neighbors just nodding the hello thing. Make them make friends. In the end you may not like them enough to really socialize with them, but at least you know who the hell they are! <br />(http://www.radioparadise.com/graphics/smiles/icon_beat.gif)

				Jake, not sure what i&#39;d do or that you need to do anything.&nbsp; We have 3 apartments in our little building.&nbsp; Jen used to be friendly with one person but she moved on.&nbsp; We know almost all the people by name and say hi but thats about it. Dont know that I need to have an intentional relationship with anyone one of them. Maybe because we know we dont have much in common with the them or maybe because do you really need to have responsibility to anyone outside your private wolrd of your home in your building (that could sound rude and anti social but you know im not). <br /><br />I guess what im saying is that you dont have to force the issue and that might make it odder for you depending on the dynamic of you overtures to others in the building and how it is received. Organic, just let it build is the way to go, IMHO.<br /><br />Plus, if she&#39;s a bitch, do you really want to know her and have her in for chips/dip and no alcohol buffer after that first bad impression?<br /><br />Love your personal space and save your apartment for friends, lovers and family.&nbsp;

				Those are all good ideas everyone thanks for the input but I further beg the question why do people behave in this manner?&nbsp; At what point did we devolve from borrow a cup of sugar and 2 eggs from the next door neighbor when you are making cookies to I don&#39;t want anything to do with you?<br /><br />More to the point, everyone that responded said they weren&#39;t friendly with their neighbors either beyond a hi how are ya kind of situation. There must be some more deep rooted reasons why the people in New York (and DC I had the same experience when I lived there) aren&#39;t more social with eachother in general.&nbsp; This extends WAY beyond just neighbors but to ppl on the subway, walking down the street.&nbsp; I baffles me how ppl can want to live among people but never interact with them.

				Blame it on my age, my gender—who cares what—my experiences are quite different than yours.<br /><br />People smile, say hello and stop to talk to me on the street, in the supermarket, at the gas station—almost everywhere I go. I respond in kind. <br /><br />When I recently had a problem, people came calling all through the night and into the morning to be sure that I was okay. Just as I would have had what happened to me had happened to someone I knew. <br /><br />Perhaps, just perhaps, you are experiencing yourself. Perhaps you are not as friendly as you want others to be with you. Jennifer&#39;s noting that you said, <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">and the &quot;bitch&quot; said &quot;yeah and?&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> might be an indication of the way you are thinking. Comon, we know you are a friendly guy, just maybe not in the way others (your peers) perceive you. Maybe it is time to look inward? I&#39;m not scolding here, just posing possabilities to help you broaden your scope of associations. <br /><br />I know a lot of people. Not all of them are my friends. But there are always people watching my back. That gives me great comfort.<br /><br />Jonathan mentioned that he has 3 apartments on his building. I have 140. Do I know everyone? Hell no! Do I know most, yep. When someone new moves in, we, the old timers, bring them a meal while they are moving in and welcome them to the building. We give them a folder with all the take-out menus from the hood, and tell them about the elevator rules, the basement rules, the building employees&#39; telephone numbers, whatever they need to get settled and comfortable. People did this for me . . . twice. The first time in 1964 when I moved in, and the second time on Easter Sunday, in the middle of a freak snowstorm in 1970 when I came home from the hospital with a baby in each arm. My neighbors made us meals for a week so that we could get acclimated to our twins. I treasure those moments.<br /><br />Okay, jumping off my soapbox, now.&nbsp; :roll:

				Shrugs. It&#39;s probably inherent to most big cities - not just NY and DC - if not elsewhere. Of course I&#39;m interested in meeting and getting to know people I live near - that&#39;s part of the appeal of this site -&nbsp; but I prefer to do it in ways that feel more natural than approaching strangers on the subway or street, where I&#39;d be seen as nuts. In fact, I think this site attests that there are lots of people around who really do want to make connections with their neighbors.<br /><br />The friendly neighbor thing isn&#39;t unheard of - my mom lives in NY and has friends all over her building - but it takes time and effort and accepting that some people will think it&#39;s weird, and since it hasn&#39;t happened naturally for me, I wave hello to my neighbors and focus my making-friends time elsewhere.<br /><br />

				My neighbors are all &quot;smile and say hi&quot; types, which is nice.&nbsp; There is a very serious language barrier, so that will prevent the relationship from going any further.&nbsp; The other day, my sister had a package delivered but neither of us were home, so the lady next door kept it for her.&nbsp; I thought that was really sweet.&nbsp; True, they&#39;re very annoying in that they seem to not clean their apartment too often and there are a host of kids running in and out all day long, but they&#39;re very nice.&nbsp; I just don&#39;t feel the need to have them over for tea.&nbsp; Rudeness is unacceptable, though.&nbsp; You all have to live in the same building; you could at least attempt civility, particularly when a new tenant politely introduces himself.&nbsp; But trying to coerce a relationship out of building-mates isn&#39;t necessarily . . . well, necessary.&nbsp; If it happens, though, then that&#39;s great.&nbsp; But my introverted self would look on close friendships among myself and fellow tenants as a privacy killer.&nbsp; There is a part of me that likes coming home virtually undetected without having to stop and carry on 5 different conversations in the vestibule before I get to my door.&nbsp; But that&#39;s just me.&nbsp; I guess I&#39;m not very nice.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)&nbsp;

				We are quite lucky and have proved the odds wrong: we are good friends with our next doors neighbors. We met them when they moved in a year ago, started with &quot;hi, hello&quot;, then introductions, and after some invitations to house parties, and even just hanging out for fun on random weeknights in each others&#39; apartments, we asked them to feed our cats while we were on vacation. Our cats love them. Its all been great-- we swapped keys with them (in case of fire/emergencies/lockout) and its all been going very well. I would count them as yet more friends Astoria has given me.<br /><br />Having said that, I abhor the rest of the people who share our floor (6 other units)... So 1/6, that&#39;s not bad, right?<br /><br />I think that its just luck-of-the-draw. In some cases, you get lucky and find neighbors with similar interests or shared background who are amiable and willing to open their homes (and minds) to new friends. But most of the time, in a city of 8 million, you won&#39;t find a match. In that case, I would discount the rude woman as not really worth your time (unless she redeems herself somehow and shows that it was just an anomalous bad day) and move on to other neighbors. If not at least for the practical reasons you stated. However, I don&#39;t agree with inviting a whole slew of people to some kind of mixer. Unless your intention is to be the building mascot or something. The turnover rate is so high for typical tenants in this city that I think that&#39;s too much effort just to make acquaintances. I happen to favor the more personal appraoch, like the one you attempted-- just don&#39;t get discouraged!<br /><br />buena suerte!

				Count me as another one of the lucky ones - there are 4 units in my little building (above a business), and I&#39;m friendly with both apartments downstairs, and a new couple just moved across the hall from us. The guys that used to be across the hall became really good friends of my roommate before I lived here, and we were totally a &quot;knock on the door and borrow a cup of sugar&quot; type of floor. They all still hang out all the time (of course, in the wilds of Brooklyn). The only reason I haven&#39;t gone over yet and said hi to the new people is because the only times I&#39;ve heard them, I&#39;ve been in no condition to see anyone (in pjs, just woke up, hair flying out all over the place, etc). Maybe tonight! :)

				first off, I have to agree with Jennifer- what the heck kind of spell check let you get away with &quot;responce&quot; ?<br /><br />but back to your original point. It takes time. I have gotten to know a lot of people in my building, and would definitely feel comfortable knocking on more than a few doors if I needed help. But it took a while. I grew up in NY and it never occurred to me to go up to my neighbors and say, &quot;hi, I just moved in&quot;. But people did come up to me and ask, and now, if I see someone new, I will go up and ask &quot;hey, did you just move in?&quot; and introduce myself. Of course, my building is a co-op and I think the residents have more of a vested interest in what is going on (my cousin stayed in my apt for a week shortly after I moved in and my neighbor went up to her the first time she saw her and asked who she was and if she was subletting my apt (subletting is not looked upon favorably in my building), now she knows I travel a lot and is not surprised when she sees a catsitter at my door... I also make a point of letting her know if I am going away). <br /><br />I think the other issue in meeting neighbors is very much a question of timing. I see people I never knew lived in my building when I leave for work 10 minutes later than usual...<br /><br />We do also have an annual X-mas party :)

				I&#39;m not sure I would invest in it too deeply - as many others here have said. It is nice to know your neighbors but not essential and not worth getting frustrated. <br /><br />Smile and say &quot;hi&quot; when you see people, take it easy and opportunities may present themselves. I think NYCMacUser&#39;s idea for a mixer could be nice. I personally would come if I rec&#39;d such an invitation from someone in my building and I could make it.<br /><br />As for the bitch next door, she probably just broke up with her boyfriend and moved to new york and hates men and thinks all new yorkers are gangsters. I wouldn&#39;t worry about her.

I miss life in the house where I grew up.&nbsp; Friends and relatives would drop by all the time.&nbsp; Grandparents had their own keys, aunts and uncles lived near by.&nbsp; There was always coffee brewing and cookies on the table.&nbsp; I miss that.&nbsp; But that existed in a world with a lot of SPACE and a stay at home mom and aunts and grandmothers.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />In the meantime - two buildings down there is a new family of 4 with two of the cutest little girls ever (3 and 5 yrs old).&nbsp; They&#39;re always outside playing with either mom or dad or both sitting on the stoop (dad is actually usually working - he&#39;s the new building super).&nbsp; Right now we&#39;re on a &quot;hi&quot; basis.&nbsp; We&#39;ve exchanged a few more words but not much.&nbsp; I ordered cupcakes for my homeroom students tomorrow and I ordered extras so that I can bring them to my new neighbors.&nbsp; I don&#39;t expect to become friends with these folk.&nbsp; But it&#39;s a neighborly gesture and I can&#39;t wait to see the girls&#39; reactions.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />

				One of the great things about Astoria is that you can walk to your friends&#39; house.&nbsp; You don&#39;t have to get in a car and drive 15-20 minutes.&nbsp; So, even if you don&#39;t know your immediate neighbors, you know you neighbors in the larger sense - friends in the neighborhood.&nbsp; On suburban LI, this was not the reality.&nbsp; Cars insulate you from your surroundings.&nbsp; I like it better here.

				I&#39;m in the same boat as a lot of people, I think, in that there&#39;s a major language barrier keeping me from becoming friends with my neighbors. Also an age barrier for that matter. It&#39;s a very small building, and the landlord/super lives above me and knows everyone and talks to everybody - I often hear the Spanish out in the hallway. It was strange when they went to Spain for a month, how quiet and somewhat non-social the building felt! But most of the people in the building are older and have lived there forever. So obviously for the white girl in her 20s, it&#39;s going to take a WHILE to get to know them.<br /><br />There is a girl who moved in around the same time I did downstairs and we&#39;ve exchanged a few words and hellos. Her boyfriend is around a lot and we say hello too. Frankly, as for the rest of them, I either a. don&#39;t ever see them (most of them work odd hours), or b. don&#39;t see them often enough to do anything more than exchange a brief smile and a nod. Or there&#39;s c. don&#39;t like them. This applies to the woman who lives below me and complains about everything to everybody. Any time I&#39;ve ever seen her she&#39;s either complaining to me about my noise or to someone else in the building about noise in general. She&#39;s a bi-atch, so I don&#39;t want to be her friend.&nbsp; :evil:
