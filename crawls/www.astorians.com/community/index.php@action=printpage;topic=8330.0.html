				If this is who I think it is he is actually quite harmless, although clearly not all there. I ask this in all seriousness - does he rap and argue with an invisible girlfriend? That would be confirmation enough for me that it is who I think it is.

				I haven&#039;t seen that guy in ages, but I&#039;ve always been wary of him.&nbsp; Is he tall and lanky?&nbsp; He&#039;s always arguing to himself, but it&#039;s directed at you if you catch his eye.&nbsp; He acts violent and does approach people.&nbsp; I have never felt safe around him.&nbsp; I had a boyfriend who would walk me home late at night because of people like him.&nbsp; I thought he had gone away somewhere, I used to see him when I lived on Ditmars, but I guess I&#039;m not on Ditmars enough anymore.&nbsp; It&#039;s upsetting he&#039;s still around.

				He used to sleep in &quot;Ditmars Park&quot; on Steinway between Ditmars and 23rd Ave. I had an apartment back then that overlooked the park and would hear him all night yelling at the ghosts in his mind. I&#039;ve seen him playing the &quot;piano&quot; on the picnic table. In my 3 years there, and seeing him walk around I&#039;ve never seen him be physically violent with anyone, or even be physically aggressive. I think he just has mental issues, but I think he&#039;s actually kinda scared. We always just ignored him and didn&#039;t make eye contact and he ignored us like we weren&#039;t there. I&#039;m not saying that he&#039;s safe - but I have been around the guy a bit (over a couple years) and haven&#039;t seen him be physically violent during that time. In the winter I think he goes somewhere else because he doesn&#039;t sleep in the Steinway parks. He only sleeps there in the summers. That was a couple years ago so may he has gotten worse or something. He clearly suffers from a disorder.

				oh my gosh.<br /><br />i have seen this guy all the time since i moved to astoria, and everytime he&#039;s around, i feel VERY uncomfortable. it does not feel good when someone is yelling at you and you dont know what they are going to do next. b/c someone unstable like this is unpredictable.<br /><br />i have asked other people about him, and they all say he&#039;s harmless. but i still feel uncomfortable around him.<br /><br />but i&#039;ve done the same as other people--- i ignore him and pray he doesnt yell at me. b/c if he does, i will call the police. <br /><br />let us know how this goes. <br /><br />

				It&#039;s obvious the man needs some serious mental help.&nbsp; I have a feeling the police already know about him and they can&#039;t do anything about it.&nbsp; My biggest fear is he continues to be passed off as harmless, and one day he does something horrible to somebody, and we all ignored the warning signs.&nbsp; He does yell directly at people, and he does feel violent.&nbsp; I wish someone would get him the help he definitely needs before he hurts someone or himself.

				I haven&#039;t seen this man, but from the description, it sounds like he&#039;s schizophrenic. He&#039;s very likely been evaluated repeatedly by the mental health system, deemed not a threat to himself or others, and released. It&#039;s pretty difficult to keep someone locked up against their will any more, since legal reforms in the 1980s (I think). Very few mentally ill people are dangerous to other people, and the ones that are tend to be sociopaths, not people with psychotic disorders... <br /><br />Still, if he&#039;s threatening people, additional intervention sounds like a good idea to me...

				The same guy used to pass my apartment on Ditmars around 10:00am with clocklike regularity. He is always talking to himself, yelling at people on the street (in general, not at anyone specifically, I think). The only thing I&#039;ve ever seen him do is follow some poor garbage collector guy and yell/talk/mutter at him. I watched him follow the garbage truck all the way down Ditmars.<br /><br />He makes me nervous as Hades, too.<br /><br />Now there&#039;s another bearded guy on Ditmars (around the &quot;weird shopping center&quot; on 43rd St) that has a similar demeanor. He&#039;s even creepier, in my opinion, because he has this half-leering smile on his face all of the time.

				Yeah, this guy has my wife freaked... I have yet to have any issues with him, but he seems to always &quot;yell and argue&quot; with her when she walks by him. To pass him off as harmless and brush him off because of mental instability is a huge mistake and he will probably either do something worse or as someone mentioned, mess with the wrong person(s) and create even more issues.

				there should be a police forum.we can post photos and give the police information and the police can post whatever issuses they have. we all have phones with camaras and video and email. <br />Since we all are adults and too busy making money to paying rent to do any vigilantly justice the police is the only hope we have.

				The weird thing is, i&#039;ve seen him wearing expensive clothes!! Those workout suits he wears, not cheap at all!!&nbsp; I do think he is out of his mind though. My friend&#039;s husband is a bodybuilder, and he is HUGE and the homeless man was actually trying to pick a fight with him (and no sane person would do such a thing!! ) I am sure the police know all about him. He&#039;s been doing this for years.

				Just say &quot;shut up, Terry&quot;. He would hang around the old laundry at 42nd &amp; 23rd Ave. all the time. Mostly harmless but sometimes he would get a bit too rambunctious.

				@neojapanese - I think that what a lot of us are trying to say (at least me) is that this particular guy has been around Astoria for years, hasn&#039;t harmed anyone that we know of, and while he makes people uncomfortable (yes, even I am uncomfortable around him - it&#039;s less about safety though - more about my personal space being invaded), he is probably harmless.<br /><br />I will agree with Harlan. He has probably gone through the system so many times, but the system can only do so much for him. He will likely come back to Astoria as well. This is his home for at part of the year, and he probably lives here because he prefers it to other neighborhoods. If it makes you feel better to call 311 or the police on him, then go ahead - be proactive, but please don&#039;t bring hate-speech into the conversation. He&#039;s a little off his rocker, but I am sure that if you touched him, he would not &quot;give&quot; you anything.

				It is over for now. I was headed to the supermarket with my grandmother and he came over screaming cuss words at us. I call the cops right away. Using the info you guys gave they got him. If he comes at me again I will just call the cops again to build up a harassment case. you guys should do the same..you don’t have to live like this.

				Look, we live in a city where we ride the subway in very close quarters and where everyone breathes on one another and touches each other and I&#039;m sure we catch all sorts of things.&nbsp; Everyone can carry something and while I don&#039;t like this particular homeless man and am extremely wary of him, I think going on about how he might have something is big time overboard.&nbsp; With that logic, I might as well not leave the house because I might catch all sorts of things just by touching the pole on the subway.&nbsp; The man needs mental help, I think we&#039;ve all established that.&nbsp; But I have the feeling that people are right in saying he probably has had help from the system repeatably, and nothing much will be done.&nbsp; So I will probably continue to be extremely wary of this man and stay the hell away from him, just like I do anyone else who makes me nervous.&nbsp; I just hope I don&#039;t ever have to walk down a lonely street with him.&nbsp; If he ever did threaten me or come at me in some way, you bet I would call the cops.

				I tend to be a bit blase about this sort of thing and I think it is due to living in NYC in the 70&#039;s and 80&#039;s.&nbsp; There were homeless absolutely everywhere, yelling in the streets, running around muttering incoherently etc.&nbsp; To see someone eating from a garbage can was not unusual.&nbsp; People were constantly trying to wipe your windshield with dirty rags.&nbsp; As a young working gal, I witnessed:<br /><br />Three girls have their earrings torn off.&nbsp; You would never wear dangly earrings in those days.<br />Six purse snatchings.<br />Three men expose themselves to me, on the subway.<br />A homicide in Bryant Park.<br />Two muggings.<br />I got hit on the head by a homeless person.<br />Homeless people pushing shopping carts all over the city.<br />Some other stuff I won&#039;t even mention here.<br /><br />This was normal stuff if you were out and about in the city.&nbsp; I don&#039;t miss those days (I think!).<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Looks like the server crashed and lost a very interesting line of conversation we had on here yesterday.&nbsp; For my part, I basically said that we are all compassionate people and we all feel for the folks who, for whatever reason, are in the streets.&nbsp; But on the other hand, it is ok to feel disturbed by the people who are in the streets.&nbsp; Especially those who are threatning like our friend in the above discussion.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t matter if he is violent, or only threatning violence.&nbsp; He is an unpleasance upon our streetscape.&nbsp; We all love this neighborhood, and want to keep it nice, and it does nothing for us to have this man in the streets.&nbsp; Nor does it help him.

				I don&#039;t think I object to the feelings or the reactions, it&#039;s really the way that they were stated. So much of the comments made about this guy have been very polarizing and, I think, unnessicarily negative. While we shouldn&#039;t feel guilty for having apartments when he and others don&#039;t, it is important to realize that it can happen to anyone--good people and dangerous scary people--and that we don&#039;t know enough about him to really definitively say what kind of person he is. It&#039;s important to be cautious and call the authorities when someone gets too scary or too out-of-hand, but we don&#039;t need to get haughty and insist that he&#039;s diseased or a plague or any of these things. He&#039;s certainly in a terrible position in life and whether he&#039;s been run through the system a dozen times or not, it doesn&#039;t sound like it&#039;s going to get better for him. I think he at least deserves some of our pity along with the fear that we feel.

				I read here that this man yelled at people.&nbsp; Frightened people.&nbsp; And dashed in front of moving cars, terrifying drivers.&nbsp; The sum total of this is that the man is a menace to society.&nbsp; I don&#039;t believe anyone on this forum wishes him harm or bad ending.&nbsp; But he either needs help or he needs to be disciplined.&nbsp; Be it a shelter, hospital, or jail.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t matter.&nbsp; But he is having a negative impact on our quality of life.&nbsp; He is frightening our neighbors and loved ones as they go about their business.&nbsp; And that should not be tolerated - no matter how humane we are.

				I&#039;ve read the thread and I think what stands out as being a nonsequitor is the comment about how &quot;you dont know whats in his blood.&quot; Screw that type of thinking.<br /><br />Like it&#039;s been said before, he most likely has been picked up and dropped off because there are not very many resources for this man, but I agree with those who don&#039;t want to tolerate fear either. <br /><br />It&#039;s a sad situation, who knows what obstacles he has infront of him, and who knows who has failed him in his life. <br /><br />But then again, when the crazy homeless man harrassed me on the b61 in Long Island City for being a &quot;homo&quot; and a &quot;dyke&quot; due to my short hair, and that he &quot;wishes I was dead&quot; and other comments filled with expletives, I secretly hoped for some ill things to happen to him, so I know how clean the ivory tower is and how dirty the ground can be!

				Maybe people here (myself included) could be more sensitive in their language choice.&nbsp; And it is probably true that this guy is mentally ill, or in the throes of a substance addiction, or both.&nbsp; But, again, I don&#039;t think anyone wishes ill upon the guy.&nbsp; Nor is anyone being particularly haughty.&nbsp; To assume that the guy has some blood borne disease is unfair, because we don&#039;t know him.&nbsp; But it is natural to feel a sense of revulsion in cases like this.&nbsp; <br /><br />And whether the guy HAS a plague or is merely a plague upon our streetscape isn&#039;t operative.&nbsp; He needs to be in contact with the system, and it is a blessing when people call the police on guys like this.&nbsp; It makes our streets safer when something is finally done, satisfying our own selfish ends. <br /><br />AND it helps to usher this guy towards the help he needs.&nbsp; If he is released repeatedly, persistence is the order of the day.&nbsp; I don&#039;t mean to take anything away from the numerous charities that bring food and supplies to those on the streets.&nbsp; But the needs of people on the streets are more complex than the immediate need for food.&nbsp; I feel like the prevailing attitude is that street living is a way of life and we should respect that.&nbsp; That doesn&#039;t ring as true to me in a city where there are more social service resources than perhaps anywhere else, and so many generous folks wanting to help out.&nbsp; People do not belong on the streets where they are a detriment to our quality of life and theirs.

				I saw this guy on 24th Avenue the other day.&nbsp; I had seen him before, but prior to reading this thread, I wasn&#039;t aware of his following.&nbsp; As a (stupid) experiment, I decided to see if I could stare him down.&nbsp; So, as he was walking and sort of babbling/yelling/pontificating/whatever I looked at him and he looked at me at which point he redirected his babbling/yelling/pontificating/whatever towards me.&nbsp; I just sort of stood there and stared at him and he continued walking.&nbsp; <br /><br />What&#039;s my point?&nbsp; Well, really nothing.&nbsp; Maybe that I&#039;m stupid.&nbsp; While I think measures should be taken - though I can&#039;t suggest anything - I don&#039;t feel this guy is truly looking for a fight.&nbsp; Can anyone understand what he&#039;s saying?&nbsp; I can&#039;t.&nbsp; I&#039;m fairly certain that when I entered my building after the above mentioned encounter, he yelled, &quot;Why can&#039;t anybody open the door, man?!?!&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />When I pass him it seems to me that he&#039;s just sort of yelling for the sake of yelling and there isn&#039;t a real intent behind it.&nbsp; I&#039;m not suggesting we all let it go, but maybe trying to soften the situation.&nbsp; <br /><br />I wish I could suggest some sort of solution, but I don&#039;t know a lot about this sort of thing.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				coming from a so-called &quot;bleeding heart&quot;, i&#039;m not angry at neojap for being upset about his/her situation with this guy.&nbsp; as i mentioned, i support him/her calling the police if he/she felt threatened enough to do so.&nbsp; i hope it somehow helped (although i have my doubts, and no one has yet confirmed whether this guy is still walking around).<br /><br />what i am concerned about is the WAY he/she last expressed his/her emotion on it.&nbsp; obviously he/she is angry (with good cause), but i think his/her comments have been more inflammatory than anything else.&nbsp; <br /><br />just because you are angry about a situation, doesn&#039;t mean that you can&#039;t be SOMEWHAT compassionate.&nbsp; and it seems that the more people chimed in about their same experiences, the worse the comments got.&nbsp; as a result, he/she was far more likely to get a negative reaction than anything else because that is the way he/she set the tone.&nbsp; that&#039;s what i meant when i threw the term &quot;karma&quot; out there.<br /><br />i don&#039;t recall one person saying, &quot;aw, let this guy be...&quot; or anything to that effect.&nbsp; it&#039;s obvious that this guy needs to be helped by some agency.&nbsp; he sounds far beyond anything that a &quot;civilian&quot; can help him with.&nbsp; but how can that get done?

				Honestly, you&#039;re going to deal with homeless no matter where you pick to live in Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn. &nbsp;I&#039;m sure the Bronx as well. &nbsp;I think the problem is worse in San Francisco, if you&#039;ve been there. &nbsp;I still think Astoria is pretty safe and the neighborhood very friendly. &nbsp;It has a very small town feel. &nbsp;It&#039;s a day after Halloween and the holiday decorations on the streets are already up. &nbsp;NYC is known as the safest and friendliest big city right now. &nbsp;Just do as you would in any other big city. &nbsp;Keep your wits about you and go about your business. &nbsp;Don&#039;t make eye contact with those you&#039;re uneasy around, avoid them, and ignore them as best you can. &nbsp;If you can, make a trip out here and visit the area. &nbsp;Decide for yourself what area you want to live in.

				When I first visited NYC from SoCal, I was scared out of my mind. That phase passed.<br /><br /><br />Still, I highly recommend that others visit Astoria and NY.<br />This city challenges and offers much.<br /><br />But if I were raising teenagers, I would probably want to still enjoy the suburbs of Cal. <br />Still, the family would be missing out on a lot that NY offers. <br /><br /><br />I feel largely safe in Astoria given it is part of a big city.

				Clearly the mentally ill are being dumped out of shelters.&nbsp; I see the same people all the time in other parts of Astoria.&nbsp; There was one particular man that I would see on the bench where I get the bus to go to work.&nbsp; He&#039;d be there hours later when I got off the bus coming home.&nbsp; In anticipation of a rain storm coming I called 311 and said there was a homeless mentally ill man who had been living on that bench for a couple of weeks.&nbsp; 311 switched me to an appropriate agency who in turn switched me to the homeless-outreach office for Queens and Brooklyn.&nbsp; They asked for a detailed description of the man, what he was wearing (I had to describe all 3 jackets since he was changing his wardrobe while I was on the phone), and I was told the outreach unit would definitely be out that night to talk to him and encourage him to come into the system, but they can&#039;t force him in.&nbsp; The person I was talking to was head of the unit and I have no doubt that someone did come out, but the next time I passed by, the man was still there.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen him sitting there in the rain.&nbsp; Everybody at 911, 311, the police department, the fire department, emergency medical services, h.r.a., - everybody is aware of the problems of the homeless and mentally ill.&nbsp; All we can do on the spot is call when we see the problem.&nbsp; Aside from that, I think the best thing we can do for the homeless-mentally ill is to contact the media.&nbsp; Our government is free to let these people live in their own hell-on-earth because the government operates in the dark.&nbsp; Let&#039;s ask the media to turn the spotlight on the mayor, the governor, and the presidential candidates and ask them what they intend to do about the problem.<br /><br />Whatever you do, don&#039;t take it upon yourself to invite the person into your home.&nbsp; The problem with mental illness is that you can&#039;t predict what the person is going to do.&nbsp; But please <em>do</em> do something.&nbsp; If the person is in the rain, the snow, the cold, call 911.&nbsp; If the situation is not extreme, call 311.&nbsp; Keep on calling.<br /><br />Once there was a guy sitting on the curb in Manhattan.&nbsp; A cop went over and asked him if he was all right.&nbsp; The guy said he didn&#039;t know.&nbsp; The officer asked him if he would like to go to Bellview.&nbsp; The guy could have gone to Bellview at any time - he was from New York and knew his way around.&nbsp; For whatever reason he hadn&#039;t gone by himself.&nbsp; But when the cop asked, somehow that made a difference.&nbsp; He accepted the officer&#039;s offer of help.&nbsp; He went to Bellview, was put in a program, he accepted medication, and for a while he was doing better in life.&nbsp; Ten years later he died, but at least my family knew where my brother was when he died, in part because that one cop went over and asked if he was all right.<br /><br />

				I think this belong here.. Anyway, I was walking to the R and decided to stop in at Uncle Donuts for a cuppa.. Some chick who looked lost/homeless/strung out asked if I could lend here her cell phone. I said I don&#039;t have one. Which at the time was true, left it at home. So I&#039;m getting my coffee and the woman pokes her head in and says &quot;I think you&#039;re a fuc&amp;ing liar&quot;&nbsp; I said, &quot;What the Fark? You don&#039;t have a phone why should I?&quot; I took my coffee and left. As I walked down the block, I thought this psycho chick could have whipped out a shiv or something and that would have been a whole lot of not good.

				&nbsp; Let me tell you something about that guy and the homeless at the West Way.&nbsp; I live a few blocks from there and have been her all 36 yrs of my life.&nbsp; Not only is it a welfare/red cross hotel.&nbsp; But the savage throw away criminals from Katrina are living there like fat hogs.&nbsp; The reason that they are so well dressed is because they get money everyday.&nbsp; Like a few hundred.&nbsp; I used to see them get off the bus with dept store bags everyday.&nbsp; There are a bunch of them that walk through my neighborhood at all hours looking to antagonize and cause trouble to the locals.&nbsp; I was finding empty bottles of booze on my lawn for the longest.&nbsp; That muscle head is a sick man and is a time bomb waiting to go off.&nbsp; You libs have no idea what a man like that is capable of.&nbsp; I confronted Vallone about this during the summer in front of Commerce bank on Ditmars after he was talking to the press about Con Ed.&nbsp; I waited until the cameras were off and hammered him with questions about what he was doing.&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t rude with him nor did I try to make him look bad, but he gave me very generic answrs and gave me his card.&nbsp; The press people very very quiet and listened carefully not packing up to leave.&nbsp; I hope Vallone accomplished this because I too like others am looking to move.&nbsp; Astoria has changed.&nbsp; Still a great place to live but it has changed.

				For god’s sake get a grip everyone: It’s ONE homeless/bum/hobo/crackpot/mental case, or however you want to label him -- ONE!<br /><br />From the comments generated here you’d think an army of homeless zombies have invaded – jeez -- this ONE guy is a nuisance but really, some of you, stop being idiots about it.<br /><br />It’s not the 70s or 80s dejavu all over again so buck up already.<br /><br />Being homeless is not a crime, either is being mentally ill, but as citizens of the big city we all know that the two in combination have sometimes -- and I mean occasionally, aka has happened, in rare cases – resulted&nbsp; in deadly consequences.<br /><br />I’ve seen this ONE guy muttering to himself on Ditmars for a while and he has once or twice made unintelligible comments as I passed. I haven’t been bothered that much. Others obviously have been.

				also, to make a blanket statement about the entire area of astoria is ridiculous.&nbsp; <br /><br />i&#039;ve lived here all of my life.&nbsp; the first part around 30th avenue and 32nd street (where i grew up), and now around 20th avenue and 27th street (as a married woman).<br /><br />yes, the neighborhood as a whole has changed over the last 35 years, but what neighborhood stays the same for long (especially in a city as large and as diverse as ours)?!<br /><br />is it worse?&nbsp; maybe.&nbsp; but that&#039;s also pretty subjective.&nbsp; for example, i don&#039;t particularly like how busy the 30th avenue/broadway area has become.&nbsp; i&#039;m glad that i now live on this side of astoria blvd, where it&#039;s a little more &quot;civilized&quot;.<br /><br />there has always been homeless people in astoria...hell, everywhere in this city.&nbsp; as i&#039;ve said before, there is no place in the world where you don&#039;t have some sort of down-trodden segment of the population.&nbsp; if it&#039;s not going to be a homeless person, it might be the neighbood drunk or addict, or pervert, or general grouch...whatever the case may be.&nbsp; it happens.&nbsp; if they&#039;re not causing any tangible harm to the general public (enough for the police to take some action), then ignore them and move on with your life.&nbsp; get over it.&nbsp; you will never find a place in the world where it&#039;s going to be absolutely perfect.<br /><br />i think as a whole, astoria is far from being as bad as some of you are making it out to be.&nbsp; and if you&#039;re absolutely certain that it&#039;s not for you, then TRY to find some place that you are more suited for.&nbsp; GOOD LUCK with that, by the way.

It’s easy for some people to make academic arguments about ‘the homeless’ issue or condemn those with less sympathetic opinions, from a safe distance but when what is essentially a warehouse of people literally on your doorstep and you are forced to deal with the issue every day, face-to-face, well, I am less inclined to criticize those people who may come across as abrupt or negative on the issue. <br /><br />But I have to agree when you use terms like ‘savages’ or ‘uncivilized’ you instantly lose your argument in my book. Some people just fall on hard times – don’t you have any compassion?<br /><br />And finally a question -- The Westway has been used as a shelter for homeless families as well as detainees waiting for deportation for how many years now? 10 years…maybe longer? – And now you decide Astoria has changed and it’s so intolerable that you want to move? What gives?<br /><br />

				Helen, The face that launched a thousand ships.<br />Homeless Guy, The man who caused a thousand posts.<br /><br />Interesting thread to read, but in my opinion, I wouldn&#039;t give too much attention to what neojapanese or originalastorian have written.&nbsp; Not too much between them and my personal favorite, &quot;notgay&quot;.&nbsp; Notgay managed to get some folks so riled up that they got banned and then left the community.&nbsp; These identities were created specifically for this thread.&nbsp; They aren&#039;t backing up their positions with the standing which comes from being part of a community.&nbsp; So whether they are intentionally flaming or trolling or are just bold. it doesn&#039;t matter to me.&nbsp; In a faceless, identity covered forum such as this, the number of posts someone has up and the variety of items which they talk about go a long way in establishing standing.&nbsp; That standing, even if I disagree with someone (who me? :-)), is what gets me to give attention to someone&#039;s post in threads such as these.&nbsp; Neojapanese and Originalastorian have not met my standards in establishing standing and their posts recieve very little weight.

Most of us lifers can’t afford to buy either. You might have had a friendlier response from people given that many of us are in the same boat.

				I see this guy almost every day. He walks down my block towards Astoria Park. Being female and having grown up in NYC I know better than to look at him directly. He hangs out at the park and when I&#039;m there I avoid eye contact and steer way clear of him. Yesterday, while looking out my window at home, I saw him walking in the middle of the street, then he just stopped cold, whipped it out and peed. In broad daylight without any shame like a dog, but not on a tree- in the middle of the street. If police were going by would they have arrested him for indecent exposure? What if someone was walking by-like a mother pushing her stroller? Would he have done the same thing? Or worse? He is without question a lunatic, and when something really bad happens to someone that&#039;s when people will say &quot;Why was he allowed to walk the streets for so long?&quot; For now I tell my mother to be careful and not to look at him while she&#039;s in her own front yard or sweeping the sidewalk doing her part to keep Astoria clean! How ironic.

				It&#039;s him judging by the description. He&#039;s all over the place! He&#039;s really fit and all he does is just wander around. Day and Night. Everyday. Although, surprisingly, he does sometimes take a breather on the benches at Astoria Park, where he continues to talk/yell to himself and to passersby. I think he spooks a lot of people because he is so energetic and intense. There&#039;s another homeless guy in the park who kind of breaks my heart. He&#039;s a black guy who just sits solemnly all by himself on the same bench near the pool and either reads a newspaper or does nothing. Like a statue. Seems real mellow- the complete opposite of our Scary Friend.

				That&#039;s so sweet. He seems so sad, sitting there alone. Not yelling and ranting at the world. Just by himself, but perhaps he&#039;s at peace in the park with only the squirrels and trees around him.

				You don&#039;t have to be a psychologist to have a survival instinct. If you ever cross paths with Our Scary Friend you will either want to:<br />a) run away<br />b) avert your eyes quickly<br />c) call the cops<br />We drove on 23rd Ave today and there he was walking in to a deli, and of course he started yelling at two unfortunate people walking out of the deli. They just kept walking. I guess they represented the system to him too.

				Hey, rnrgirl! That&#039;s a cool combinbation! I&#039;m actually half Greek and half Japanese! The Japanese side is my better side, though! When people from other countries ask what &quot;I am&quot; I tell them &quot;half Greek, half Japanese and all American&quot;. I was an army brat and there were a lot of mixed marriages. I had many friends who were of mixed race. I didn&#039;t experience any prejudice growing up until we moved here (I also lived in Texas and California). It&#039;s a shame that in such a culturally and racially mixed city there&#039;s so much bigotry. As long as people try to be decent and respectful of each other I don&#039;t care what they are. Did you grow up here? I&#039;ve been living here almost forever...Anyway, to stay on the thread- homeless people in the residential parts of Astoria was never really a problem when I was growing up here. They congregated more in the business areas, where I guess they could scrounge some money and bicker with each other, but I guess times have changed.

				I&#039;m not a psychologist, but there are dangerous people who are sociopaths. They are not only on Rikers Island, but can also be our neighbors. That&#039;s the scary part, because they are harder to pinpoint. They are slippery. Atleast the raving lunatic madman/woman on the street is easier to identify and avoid, unless they sneak up on you in the dark! I&#039;m scaring myself now.<br />

				Yeah, essen. I have to agree. Jap ain&#039;t too cool. Reminds me of: &quot;Kill the Japs!&quot; during WWII. Of course &quot;Kill the Long-Nose Round-Eye American Pig-Dogs!&quot; -just made that up- isn&#039;t any better. But, I think people get a little kick out of saying those things. I suppose we all have the bigot in us, whether it&#039;s calling someone Jap, Chink, Pinko-Commie, or Racist-Sexist-Homophobe. However, this is America and we should be above such a Tribal outlook on life. I mean, America isn&#039;t Kosovo or Darfur is it? And also- there has been a rise in anti-Japanese sentiment in the Far East, as well as a rise in anti-semitism in Europe. So, here we are in NYC. Sometimes I call it &quot;The Armpit of the Nation&quot; when I read too much of the Daily News, but compared to many parts of the world I suppose Americans are VERY tolerant of others and that&#039;s why we tend to flinch a bit when we hear subtle/not so subtle...we should just worry about survival in this city and doing what&#039;s right- not just for ourselves, but for the rest of the community. Unfortunately, everyone has their own agenda, it seems, in this city. Sorry I got off-topic. Gotta go for a jog in the park. Betcha I cross paths with our Scary Homeless Friend!! Be well everyone! It was nice chatting, hope I come back alive!

				Eh! I&#039;m just glad he walks on the other side of the street all the time, but I DO think he&#039;s probly a ticking time bomb. RnRGrl: I always checked &quot;white&quot;-reluctantly! When I asked my parents (as a kid) they responded gruffly &quot;White, because that&#039;s what your father is!&quot; But, I never felt either white or Asian-just a mutt! Anyways, that was back in the 70&#039;s when ethnic identity wasn&#039;t such a big deal. Another reason I felt kinda lost was because when we moved here in the late sixties there were NO Japanese or possibly even Asians living here. Kids I met would ask what I was and I&#039;d say half Japanese and they&#039;d say &quot;Wow! Do you speak Chinese?&quot; And I&#039;d just roll my half squinty eyes.

				That guy has always freaked me out, years before this post.&nbsp; I don&#039;t doubt her reaction, the guy is scary.&nbsp; Yeah, people talk to themselves, it happens all the time.&nbsp; However, when it&#039;s loudly directed at you and the tone and physicality of it is violent, I do get scared and try to get out and away from the situation as fast as possible.&nbsp; This guy has always made me feel scared and uncomfortable.&nbsp; Regardless, NeoJapanese&#039;s comments are inflammatory and I would think it&#039;s best to ignore him at this point.&nbsp; That the thread has gone on this long is really sad.&nbsp; Can&#039;t we move on and ignore the inflammatory comments?&nbsp;

				I was collecting leaves this evening and Scary walks by ranting as usual. I didn&#039;t dare look in his direction and just kept sweeping, but I could see from the corner of my eye that as he was walking by (up 23rd Ave) he sauntered over to my side of the street. He usually stays on &quot;his&quot; side. Meanwhile he&#039;s cussing up a storm and slowing down. I&#039;m thinking to myself &quot;Don&#039;t you dare look at him!&quot; I know damn well he was looking back at me and just waiting for me to look in his direction. Boy, was my heart beating fast. I WILL call the cops on him if he gets in my face or even if I get this scared again, and I will complain loudly to them to get this Wacko-Psycho off the street! That&#039;s it!

				look, i&#039;ve never said that this guy doesn&#039;t need help.&nbsp; based on what everyone who has seen this guy has said (i haven&#039;t), it&#039;s true that some agency needs to do something about him.&nbsp; but what and who?&nbsp; i&#039;ll bet that there has been numerous calls to the police about this guy.&nbsp; if there was something that they could do, i&#039;m sure they would.&nbsp; obviously no one (including himself) should have to get hurt in order for something to be done, but unfortunately that&#039;s the way the system works.&nbsp; since this guy is still freely walking around, it doesn&#039;t even sound as if he is doing ANYTHING that the police can focus on, as billz1981 has suggested (ie: peeing in the street, loitering, etc).<br /><br />i&#039;m of the school that EVERYONE is entitled to basic human rights, and until it&#039;s proven that they are a true threat to themselves or society, they should be treated that way...homeless or not....crazy or not....seemingly normal or not.<br /><br />i simply don&#039;t appreciate neojapanese&#039;s approach to the entire thread.&nbsp; his/her logic doesn&#039;t make sense to me in the least, and actually, it sounds quite heartless.&nbsp; someone suggested ignoring neojapanese&#039;s comments, and i think that&#039;s the wisest thing.

				rnrgrl I understand what you are saying, but this guy doesn&#039;t mumble or talk to himself-he yells like he is ready to pounce! He is not seething-he is erupting. That&#039;s why everyone who had an encounter with him is so shook up. I know the cops would probably say: &quot;We&#039;ve had many calls about him, but unfortunately we cannot just bodily remove him until we have good cause. He has to hurt himself or someone else first.&quot; Yeah right. So what am I supposed to do? Not step out of my house at unsafe times-like in the middle of the day? Not walk in Astoria Park in the middle of the day? Don&#039;t jog in the park at noon? Don&#039;t sweep the sidewalk before sundown? Now THAT is crazy.That&#039;s what I would ask the police, and they&#039;ll say: &quot;Don&#039;t worry M&#039;am, we have our eye on him.&quot; I&#039;ll look at this positively and be glad that harsh winter weather is coming and maybe he&#039;ll go into hibernation for awhile. If not-I hope he ends up like Jack Nicholson in the Shining and his frozen corpse will be found in the park-on the bench-with his foul mouth wide open. Just kidding. No, really, he needs help. Someone please take him away and give him some meds and make sure he doesn&#039;t skip a single dose.

				i do hear what you are saying johnny4evah...you should be able to feel safe, especially in your own neighborhood...that is another basic human right.&nbsp; in hindsight, i think i have seen this guy in astoria park once or twice.&nbsp; i do recall seeing some guy yelling to himself...and although i thought it was odd, i just ignored it and kept my distance.&nbsp; i can&#039;t honestly say i was fearful of him though. <br /><br />since nothing can really be done with this guy from a social services standpoint, you can only do what you would do in any similar situation...regardless of the person in question...be aware of your own environment and keep your distance where ever possible.&nbsp; try not to let fear control you and just live your life as you must.<br /><br />of all these postings on this guy, i don&#039;t recall one saying that this guy has ACTUALLY harmed anyone.&nbsp; don&#039;t let yourself believe that you&#039;re going to be the first.&nbsp; i know it&#039;s easier said than done, but what else can you do?&nbsp; if you react otherwise, then you let him (or any other crazy person) control you.&nbsp; i think that&#039;s one of the lessons that should have been confirmed in this post-9/11 society.<br /><br />i&#039;m a woman too, and of course, there have been situations where my <em>spidey-senses</em> have tingled.&nbsp; when you&#039;re in that situation, all you can do is make your way out of it the best you can.&nbsp; 9.9999 of 10 times it passes.&nbsp; and, if you&#039;re ever in that unfortunate position where something does actually happen, then you have no other choice by to make your way out of that.<br /><br />no matter where you are in the world, stuff may happen, and all you can do is deal with it as it comes.&nbsp; if it&#039;s not going to be this guy, it might be your neighbor next door, or the guy you&#039;ve worked with for the last dozen years.&nbsp; you can never really know about anyone, can you?!

				I just realized last night that I actually have seen and had encounters with who I think is the guy in question. In fact, I think I&#039;ve walked past him a number of times on the blocks around my house (Ditmars &amp; 23rd Ave from 21st-28th area). He&#039;s certainly strange and creepy, but I&#039;ve never felt like he was yelling at me or at anyone in the vincinity. While the screaming is startling and scary, I&#039;ve never seen him direct it in someone&#039;s direction. I might just be lucky, but this makes me think he&#039;s probably more likely to hurt himself before he hurts someone else. Regardless of how right or wrong I am about that, as much as I wish he wouldn&#039;t scream when he walks around the &#039;hood, I don&#039;t really think someone yelling and carrying on like that is a legitimate reason to presume them murderous, &quot;very dangerous&quot; or as needing to be locked up. It&#039;s completely legit to be scared, cross the street, keep your eyes out and the like, but I think those are things that I do because I&#039;m uncomfortable and I don&#039;t only do them around him. There are plenty of people who set off my spidey-senses that I just plain don&#039;t like, but that doesn&#039;t mean they ought to be presumed &quot;very dangerous&quot; or put away.

				There is a Broadway area guy who I have seen for years.&nbsp; He usually has his wheeling suitcase with him, or a duffel bag, and he wears a &#039;do rag.&nbsp; He sometimes yells and swats in the air, and clearly sees things that we do not.&nbsp; But I have never seen him confront anyone directly, and in fact lots of local people and store clerks seem to know him and talk with him on a regular basis.&nbsp; I do worry about him because I have seen him running out into traffic and I would hate for him to get hurt.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t think he&#039;s the man who was the original subject of this thread, as that man seems directly confrontational.&nbsp; At least from what I read here.&nbsp; I&#039;m from closer to the Broadway area and don&#039;t make it out by you guys much.

				I think everyone has lumped &quot;their homeless guy&quot; into being this same one. I don&#039;t think the guy that billz is referring to-whom i have been seeing the 7 years I&#039;ve lived here-is the same guy up at ditmars. granted he&#039;s homeless and has a lot of time on his hands and could be all over the place, but I doubt it. i think everyone just jumped on the bandwagon of similar homeless characteristics unnecessarily.

				The person who my wife felt threatened by is a black male, very dark, very skinny, no facial hair and possibly bald. (I can&#039;t recall a doo-rag or rolling suitcase). We&#039;d see him on Broadway in the upper 30s., and around the Steinway R stop.

				This guy I&#039;m referring to carries a shopping bag, is black, athletic build in a wiry sort of way, bald, walks with a pretty quick pace on the side of the road, looks back now and then, sometimes stops cold, all the while cussing and yelling. If he sees someone he directs his tirade in their direction. People glance at him and keep going. Lately he&#039;e been wearing a hoodie or scarf wrapped around his head, looking like an urban grim reaper. My bf says he&#039;s seen him all the way up Ditmars Blvd in the upper 40&#039;s. He&#039;s all over the place. So, we wondered is he on something or just plain nuts? Either way, he&#039;s like a freakin, walking IED. I&#039;m minding my business, at peace with the world and BOOM! He pops up, yelling and cussing and looking at me! I guess I freak out about this guy because I live real close to the park where the street is pretty deserted. Many of my neighbors are retirees and homemakers, but lately they don&#039;t venture out. When he is in the park he seems a bit calmer, but still rambles to himself. I think his condition worsens when he&#039;s on the move.

				Aye! That be the demon you speak of. One in the same. It reeks of rotting flesh, its face is riddle with disease, its toothless mouth spews cuss words like a raving lunatic. He doesn&#039;t care if you have a new born in your arms or if ya walking side by side with your grandmamma. He will accost you when you least expect it. I bet he has a criminal record! Worst of all…he has a good memory so he will torment you every time he sees you. Because of this man, no longer will the old folks of Astoria sit outside of their homes, no longer will the children play in the street. An empty block is an invitation to crime. Lock your doors and bar your windows. If one&nbsp; psycho homeless can cause this then imagine 5 or 10 of them. Astoria is fast becoming a magnet for homelessness and criminals and doomed to become a ghetto. Crack heads are already breaking in to our homes! To take what? 2 year old computers? No one keeps cash in the house! The painting on the wall says &quot;we need a hero!&quot; a few cops with bad tempers and Blackwater private security guards what we need.

				When I hear people complaining about stuff constantly without any remarks about how to fix the problem or at least make it a little better, It always gets my goat. If it matters enough to you to constantly talk about it or have such strong opinions, why don&#039;t you devote some of that energy into ideas about how to make it better? Even if it&#039;s just something small or insignificant, at least something.

				What you can&#039;t accept is that his idea of making it better -- having the police cart homeless guys like this one away -- isn&#039;t to your liking. Apparently he&#039;s contacted the police numerous times; that&#039;s doing something. However, this just doesn&#039;t jibe with your sensibilities.

				But where do the police put them? Jail? Mental hospitals? <br /><br />Don&#039;t we already do this, to an extent? How much should it be increased? What will keep them from coming back and keeping this problem from constantly reoccuring?<br /><br />If he wants the police to deal with the homeless, that&#039;s an understandable position--but what exactly should they do with them once they cart them away? He&#039;s not asking for a solution, just to keep them out of his sight.

				Have yet to see this dude but he sounds like a pain in the ass.<br /><br />Running at cars sounds not only dangerous, but scary. Violent screaming makes everyone feel uncomfortable and I hope he&#039;s dealt with. There was a homeless man living on Hoyt Ave near Nebuta (31st and Hoyt) and he never caused a problem and never spoke. I helped him out a few times &#039;cause I knew the dude was just down on his luck.

				I wasn&#039;t going to post in this thread but I think I need to enlighten some of you about this man. I live right by Steinway park which was this man&#039;s &quot;home&quot; for quite sometime, then he got moved to the Westway from what I understand. At first, I too was scared of him and his rantings and ravings. Then one day my brother was with me and I like was oh there is the crazy guy and my brother was like who Tone (nickname on the streets for Tony)..I was like how do you know his name?! He said he is harmless, seems he is on meds for schizoprenia and when he goes off his meds, which is quite often he gets like that. So for the last 2 yrs when I see Tone I always say Hi and he says Hi back, to the point that he knows my car and if I am playing my music loud when driving past him, he will stop and wave and do a little dance for me, always makes me laugh. Anyway, point of me babbling on and posting this is that he isn&#039;t as harmful as most people think.

				Ok..just some background... I usually am not that afraid of homeless people.. grew up in San Francisco and Berkeley.. where there are homeless people all around.&nbsp; I usually cross the street, don&#039;t make eye contact and I hardly have any problem.&nbsp; But there is this dude on 31rst and Astoria Blvd (Dunkin Donuts)... I don&#039;t know what is ethnic/racial background is.. wild guess is middle eastern, Latino, southern European.. he is about 5&#039;7&quot; light olive skin.&nbsp; Sometimes talking to himself.. mostly glaring at women.&nbsp; I am assuming he is sometimes homesless because sometimes he is cleaned up, shaved and with a hair cut, and othertimes I have seen him on the floor in the street sleeping.&nbsp; It is the WAY this guy makes eye contact with me when I am trying to avoid him that freaks me out.&nbsp; He sometimes yells directly towards me, so he is speaking to me and asks if I can help him out.&nbsp; Then he smirks with this look on his face like he is thinking about something and it isn&#039;t good.&nbsp; I try to avoid it, but he is at the bottom of the platform of my train at Astoria Blvd.&nbsp; I really think one day he is going to do something.&nbsp; For now I have decided to walk on the otherside of the platform... but sometimes when it is raining or I have had a hard day at work, I just forget.&nbsp; The other problem with walking on the north end is that it is basically more desolate and then I would have to cross under the bridge... again not totally safe late at night...so I weight my options and decide to just face him and risk him following me since there are more people on this side and I can run into a restaurant or something.&nbsp; Funny thing is that I can&#039;t call the police because what am I going to do tell them I have a &quot;gut feeling&quot;....&nbsp; He knows where I live because he wonders around and one day saw me get into my apartment. I also saw him going into my trash.&nbsp; It really freaks me out.&nbsp; I want to be able to get off the train and just go home. I guess that is the price for living in NYC.... I never have seen him bother men and every time I see him he seems more and more &quot;comfortable&quot; firecting himself towards me... Sorry I am having a hard time putting my finger on the issue and describing it....

				I have missed this thread.&nbsp; &nbsp;:wink:<br /><br />Salsa, I think you should at least call 311 in this case.&nbsp; It seems like there is a pattern of harassment here if the guy is leering at you, possibly following you home and watching you go inside your building, going through what might be your personal trash, etc.&nbsp; Better safe than sorry.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure the authorities will be able to do anything, but I doubt they&#039;d find you out of line for reporting this sort of behavior.

				Totally forgot to post this, but a few weeks back, I was running an errand and CHG was a few paces in front of me on 23rd Ave. As we got to the corner, where that White Castle looking cafe is, CHG stopped and started yelling at 2 guys sitting in the outdoor area. He then actually went in and started not only cursing and yelling, but shoving chairs out of his way. I didn&#039;t stay around to watch the rest, but he was gone when I came back a few minutes later and the guys were still eating. Not sure whether cops were called or not. In either case, I have said in the past that he just seems crazy and not really a threat, but after that incident, I have changed my minds. Just thought all should be aware.

				Since we are talking about people in the neighborhood that make us fearful, I want to recommend to anyone reading this thread the book <strong>The Gift of Fear</strong> by Gavin de Becker.

I usually am not that afraid of homeless people.. grew up in San Francisco and Berkeley.. where there are homeless people all around.&nbsp; I usually cross the street, don&#039;t make eye contact and I hardly have any problem.&nbsp; But there is this dude on 31rst and Astoria Blvd (Dunkin Donuts)... I don&#039;t know what is ethnic/racial background is.. wild guess is middle eastern, Latino, southern European.. he is about 5&#039;7&quot; light olive skin.&nbsp; Sometimes talking to himself.. mostly glaring at women.&nbsp; I am assuming he is sometimes homesless because sometimes he is cleaned up, shaved and with a hair cut, and othertimes I have seen him on the floor in the street sleeping.&nbsp; It is the WAY this guy makes eye contact with me when I am trying to avoid him that freaks me out.&nbsp; He sometimes yells directly towards me, so he is speaking to me and asks if I can help him out.&nbsp; Then he smirks with this look on his face like he is thinking about something and it isn&#039;t good.&nbsp; I try to avoid it, but he is at the bottom of the platform of my train at Astoria Blvd.&nbsp; I really think one day he is going to do something.&nbsp; For now I have decided to walk on the otherside of the platform... but sometimes when it is raining or I have had a hard day at work, I just forget.&nbsp; The other problem with walking on the north end is that it is basically more desolate and then I would have to cross under the bridge... again not totally safe late at night...so I weight my options and decide to just face him and risk him following me since there are more people on this side and I can run into a restaurant or something.&nbsp; Funny thing is that I can&#039;t call the police because what am I going to do tell them I have a &quot;gut feeling&quot;....&nbsp; He knows where I live because he wonders around and one day saw me get into my apartment. I also saw him going into my trash.&nbsp; It really freaks me out.&nbsp; I want to be able to get off the train and just go home. I guess that is the price for living in NYC.... I never have seen him bother men and every time I see him he seems more and more &quot;comfortable&quot; firecting himself towards me...

I HATE walking by him, especially in the summers when I usually wear dresses and skirts, he definitely follows you around with your eyes...I walked home the other night and definitely thought he was following me for a few blocks....I see him sometimes stoic looking, smoking a cigarete and watching everyone, or sometimes giggling madly to himself..either way he picked a prime spot to scare everyone getting on and off the train there...

				I concur with Starwind51 - we need more treatment and better services.&nbsp; No one chooses to have mental problems or become homeless.&nbsp; That having been said, sometimes some of the folks one encounters can make a person nervous.&nbsp; We had a man on the N train on the way back tonight who was talking about having had his watch stolen, and was lugging a bunch of bags and a suitcase.&nbsp; He gave his pitch but when folks were not offering money was getting very angry.&nbsp; I do fear he&#039;s likely to get quite angry - it looks like he may have a short fuse.&nbsp; It made me really uncomfortable to be seated near him as he started getting upset, though neither I, nor the other passengers, knew what to do.&nbsp; I wish the MTA had better outreach - you see those ads on their cars, but I&#039;ve never seen any MTA staff do outreach.&nbsp;

				Part of Outreach depends on us.&nbsp; Call 311 whenever you see homeless on the trains, sidewalks or wherever.&nbsp; Note the time, location, subway station (including train line, car number, etc.) - the city services will send people out to investigate the calls.&nbsp; You can make the call anonymously, but if there are no reports, then the city government figures everything is fine.&nbsp; Remember, you could also be saving a life or two!

But those who we see on the streets are people who have been homeless long term.&#160; The &quot;chronic 10 percent&quot; I have heard them called.&#160; Mostly they&#039;re out there because of substance abuse and mental health issues.<br /><br />In this city, if you need medical or psychological help, you can get it.&#160; If you need food, you can get it.&#160; It is ok to give a person on the street a dollar, and I have done that myself.&#160; I may be more conservative than y&#039;all, but I am not without human compassion.&#160; But I know full well that the dollar is going to buy drugs or booze 9 times out of 10.&#160; People who have substance abuse issues need help that the buck you give them can&#039;t provide.&#160; That&#039;s why it&#039;s up to us to &quot;push&quot; them to get that help in any way we can.<br /><br />As far as the figure that millions of people are on the streets, that is not true.&#160; Can you imagine what that would look like?&#160; The U.S. population is only about 301 million.&#160; That is not to say that hundreds of thousands of people aren&#039;t facing the other social problems you describe.&#160; But that&#039;s a whole &#039;nother issue for a whole &#039;nother day.<br /><br />Also, just as an aside, there is a certain cruel logic to not counting people who aren&#039;t seeking employment after six months.&#160; If they are no longer seeking employment, they are obviously getting by somehow.&#160; Grim, I know.&#160;&nbsp; :|
