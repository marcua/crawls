				Cooking creole sauce today and teaching my crew about sweet and spicy in cajun cuisine.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thought id muse about it in here.<br /><br />Its all about layers in the dish. layers of flavors in your mouth.<br /><br />You start by adding butter and oil to the hot pan, put in your diced chorizo.&nbsp; get some color and smells going then add your onions, peppers and celery dice. watch for color on your veggies.&nbsp; <br /><br />This is an important time.&nbsp; there are two times to add spice, herb or seasonings.&nbsp; add your first batch of seasonings now, into the hot oils and sauteed items.&nbsp; this builds your base, your foundation of flavors.&nbsp; that strong and subtle base that your dish nestles in.&nbsp; stir it in and then add your chopped garlic.&nbsp; MMM, smell the thyme, garlic and chorizo....&nbsp; <br /><br />its all going well and its time for step 2;&nbsp; more flavor.&nbsp; remember you are still building the base.<br />what next,&nbsp; some worstershire sauce for acid and smokiness, some cayenne for heat, some dark red wine or sherry for that backround effect.<br /><br />lets talk sweet. youve got it going on now. but remember this is creole cajun food, you want heat but not just heat, you want the falvor of the cayenne or chipotle for example.&nbsp; here is where you add some honey!&nbsp; &nbsp;it balances the heat and lets you add more heat.&nbsp; you will get the flavor of the heat, not just the heat.<br /><br />its all about the balance.&nbsp; you now have the foundation of veg, herbs, heat, smokey and more,&nbsp; the honey acts as a base to bring it all together and fill your mouth all around with flavor not just the spike of hot or the hit of worstershire. its all there now waiting for the main ingredients.<br /><br />add some crushed tomatoes and sausage links.&nbsp; throw in a chicken.&nbsp; simmer this till chicken is poached and sausage is cooked through.&nbsp; pull out the chicken and sausagem cut up and put back in pot.&nbsp; add some okra, oregeno, thyme and bay leaf. simmer for a while and BAM!&nbsp; you got yourself a meal.&nbsp; <br /><br />just before service stir in a little butter off heat to round out the taste. garnish at will.<br />its a one pot dish that goes a long way.<br /><br />PS: some rice, cornbread with maple butter and ice cream for dessert will really make this meal.<br /><br />prefer seafood?&nbsp; &nbsp;swap out the sausage and chicken for shrimp, tilapia and clams.&nbsp; id keep the diced chorizo though for added flavor.&nbsp; you can also sub heavy cream for the crushed tomatoes but then remove the worstershire and use white wine instead of red.&nbsp; you get the idea.<br />

				Awesome post, Jonathan!!!&nbsp; Wow, I love that technique of cooking the chicken and then pulling it out, taking off the meat and then re-incorporating it.&nbsp; Is there any deglazing that happens, too?<br /><br />I&#39;ll have to share with you my friend&#39;s Hungarian Chicken Papikash recipe and my housemate&#39;s chicken and dumpling recipe, both of which require you to take the bird out and add the meat back in.&nbsp; Friend 1 lives in Hungary and Friend 2 is from east TN.&nbsp; Both dishes are fantastic.<br /><br />I am hungry now!&nbsp;

				Where&#39;s the drool smilie?<br /><br />Oh, yum.&nbsp; I&#39;m on line right behind NYCMacUser.<br /><br />Meg, I&#39;d love to see the Chicken Paprikash recipe, too.&nbsp; My parents just brought us two kinds of paprika (sweet and spicy) back from Spain, and I&#39;d love to put it to good use.

				Thanks, Jonathan.&nbsp; The ingredients and the combination are really inspiring for me. I will have to do some experimenting along the creole vein.<br /><br />Where can I get good chorizo around here?<br /><br />NYCMU and lanseaux, I will foward the recipe to you when I find it.&nbsp; It&#39;s a little hazy in my memory, so I just emailed my friend for some details.&nbsp; We ate it on spaetzle, btw.&nbsp; Is that how you eat yours?&nbsp; I have a low-tech spaetzle maker!&nbsp; Love that stuff, yum!<br /><br />I&#39;m beginning to feel encouraged again to cook.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				I use andouille sausage that I buy at the Union Square Greenmarket in lieu of chorizo in a similar dish that is one of my mainstays in the winter - it&#39;s really good.&nbsp; There are a couple of different vendors, but the one almost directly across from Barnes &amp; Noble makes very tasty sausage - and lots of different kinds, too.

				Where can I get good chorizo around here? &nbsp;thats a tough one. &nbsp;you can get the good dry chorizo from spain these days at most good local butchers in the hood. &nbsp;it comes in a plastic sealed package. &nbsp; &nbsp;excellent for flavor. oozes out red oil in the pan as you cook it down.<br /><br />for basic chorizo ive resorted to the stuff that comes from nj. &nbsp;mexican style chorizo. more like hotdog sausage than the real thing from spain. &nbsp;I may try my own if i can get very good fresh pork from a local farmer upstate.<br />
