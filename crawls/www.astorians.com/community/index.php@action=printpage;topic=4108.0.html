				hey all,<br /><br />I&#39;m going away for 4 days over Thanksgiving and am looking for a reliable pet sitter in Astoria/LIC that can stop by my apt a couple times over the weekend and check in on my cat (as well as feed her and take care of the litter box).<br /><br />Any good recommendations?&nbsp; And also, any cat sitter horror stories?<br /><br />Thanks!!

				Good question - looks slightly more affordable for visits: http://www.joansark.com/index.html<br /><br />I may need something like this at some point, so if anyone knows anything about Joan&#39;s Ark I&#39;d appreciate hearing about it as well.

				I not a pro either but <em>am</em> a cat owner myself and if we live near each other, I would be happy to come by and take care of them over the weekend in exchange for you trading off and looking in on mine occasionally if I travel in the future -- based on your availability at the time, of course.&nbsp; I wouldn&#39;t want to have to to take a subway so prefer walking distance.&nbsp; I live on 28th Street between 23rd &amp; 24th Avenues.&nbsp; Let me know if you&#39;re interested and I&#39;ll send you with my phone number.<br /><br /><strong>Meantime, any other pet owners reading this, let me know if you&#39;d be interested in networking on animal care for each other.&nbsp; It would be nice to have a network of pet owners in the neighborhood who could help each other out.&nbsp; I -- or somebody else -- could set up a list of contacts and try to match up people within walking distance of each other when needed.</strong><br /><br />Renee

We did it with small dogs. I watch yours, you watch mine. No fees. No stress. It worked wonderfully. Why not start a Pet Swap-Watching Service thread?<br /><br />When I was a young Mom, I swapped house cleaning with a friend. Once a week we would clean each other&#39;s houses. Sounds so silly now, but it worked like a dream. I&#39;d let things go in my house, the same way she was doing in hers. We&#39;d bitch to each other how we never seemed to have the time to get it *all* done, and then one day we decided it would be easy to do the other&#39;s place. We did this for a couple of years until she moved out of state.

Since we want to keep it local, this is the perfect place. <br /><br />I live in a very large building. Sometimes I think we have more 4-legged tenants than 2-legged! I watch every small dog in the building whenever I&#39;m needed. I love doing it. Dogs can either go to someone else&#39;s house or stay home with a live-n pet sitter. But cats *need* to stay home and be looked-in on. So many of us have pets, this would be a great asset to our community to have a sticky thread we all could turn to for help. I&#39;m going to start the thread—you decide if it can be a sticky. Okay?
