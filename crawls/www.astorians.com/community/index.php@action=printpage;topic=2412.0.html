				I&#39;ll be driving out to the farm with my 2-year-old daughter on Saturday. I went last year, and Bill is very generous with a tour and the Strawberries. It&#39;s also fun to meet other CSA&#39;ers from Brooklyn, etc.<br /><br />I have a small minivan, with room for seven people. We&#39;ll leave a bit before 11am (depends on how many pickups I need to do). Come ride with us!<br /><br />1. Aaron (driver)<br />2. Joia (the kid)<br />3. Denise (spoke with her on the phone<br />4. ...<br />5. ...<br />6. ...<br />7. ...<br /><br />Please post here is you would like a ride.<br /><br />

				I called the farm at 10 and was told that due to torrential rains and lightning they are canceling the visits. I&#39;m sure more than a few people were mostly to the farm by then. The weather&#39;s been so unpredictable lately that maybe they had a great time. I wussed out and went to the Met to look at paintings of strawberries.<br /><br />

				She said she doubted it would be rescheduled, since it was late in the season.
