			Hey all!<br /><br />Went to a new wine store called Omega Wines.<br />They were quite helpful and they carry a good selection of wines including some inexpensive ones like Concha y Torro and also an Australian wine i like by Yellow Tail. &nbsp;<br /><br />They are located on the north side of 23rd Avenue just west of 31st Street. &nbsp;And they are open Sundays!!

			Actually I priced a few things and it's expensive compared to Dominicks located on 29th and Astoria Blvd (the Triboro coming into Astoria side)<br />Yellowtail there is $5.99 Omega has it on special for $7.99.<br /><br />I also mentioned to the shop owner that the poster in the window can be a bit ofensive to women. He was interested and seemed sincere to know what I thought. nice guy, I think he decided to leave it up.<br /><br />The poster that I can't stand is of the one with all the half naked out of shape women in the bar 2 doors over. <br /><br />Maybe I'll get the nerve up to go in there and let them know that it is a bit offensive to women, like they really care.[/i]
