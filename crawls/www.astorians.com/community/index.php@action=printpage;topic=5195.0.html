				I&#39;m not sure if I should post this here or not...<br /><br />but for the past couple of days when I open astorians.com from work the adobe 6 screen pops up (I have adobe 7 pro) and the site takes longer than usual to load. <br /><br />it&#39;s not a big deal but I wonder if anyone else has noticed it.

				I don&#39;t think this is something going on server-side. I think it&#39;s possible that your browser is thinking that it&#39;s supposed to launch real when it hits the page. My browser at work does this with some sites as well. You may want to try coming to the site with www.astorians.com, or just astorians.com

				I have a problem with CLOSING the site.&nbsp; &nbsp;But then I don&#39;t think that&#39;s computer related as much as me having no willpower and being totally addicted to this joint.<br /><br />Can we have a thingy that refreshes the &quot;unread posts&quot; every few minutes?&nbsp; &nbsp; I&#39;m going thru mouse batteries like crazy clicking there all the time.&nbsp;

				Yeah, my IE7 says that &quot;this website wants to run the following add-on&quot; - Quicktime. I don&#39;t experience this with Firefox though...

				I believe this might be limited to the new version of internet explorer. Only people using Internet Explorer 7 seem to have the problem, and it seems to be infrequent. Do you use FireFox by chance too? You may want to experiment and see if that is acting the same way.

				I don&#39;t have Firefox.&nbsp; This only happens with astorians.com ... at least thus far.&nbsp; It&#39;s not a major problem, just slightly annoying to have that bleep each time I click on a thread.

				I think I found why the site was trying to open QuickTime for some of you. This problem should be fixed, and only was appearing in the new version of Internet Explorer (IE 7).<br /><br />One person reported a problem with RealPlayer also opening, or an Adobe player. Please let me know if this is still happening.
