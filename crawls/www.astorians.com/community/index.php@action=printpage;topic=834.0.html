				Looking for good, crusty, whole grain bread - any suggestions re: bakery? Preferably one with a slicer, since I can never slice my own bread properly (I either cut myself or end up with all crooked slices.) :-)<br /><br />Thanks!

				looks like their web site (http://www.artopolis.net/bakery/breads.html) has a list of the kinds of bread they make. whether they make more, i'm not sure. (i get my ciabatta from amy's bread in chelsea market (i work in the building) and freshdirect.)

				I'm with Meg on what they call a baguette. &nbsp;Ceci n'est pas une baguette.<br /><br />I've never bought any of the bread there, but the store smells good. &nbsp;Meg, generally there's not a great deal of artisanal bread in Astoria. &nbsp;Some good Italian bakeries, but we haven't experienced the Great Bread Awakening yet. &nbsp;But the way things have been changing around here, I'd be willing to bet it's coming within the year.

				Title: <strong>mislabeled web site</strong><br />

				Whoever did their web site doesn't know bread, but they do. Their best bread, I think is their six-grain bread, available with or without sesame seeds on top. That's what the web site labels &quot;baguette&quot;. They do have a real baguette (labeled &quot;semolina&quot;), which is good but not fantastic. I've also tried their Greek village bread, which is squishy for my tastes. I'm not sure that I've tried any of their other breads. <br /><br />They also have really good jams (try the sour cherry!) and some good cookies...

				I'm really looking for whole-grain stuff. You know - crusty, textured, hearty bread, none of that soft airy stuff. Generally, Mediterranean places (esp. my native Italians) usually go for the white...<br /><br />I'm surprised that in a multicultural and slightly - dare I say it? - hippie-ish place like Astoria, you can't find decent artisanal bakeries.<br /><br />Or maybe you can, and I just haven't seen them, and am now broadly generalizing and making a fool of myself... :-)

				Semiastorian, I completely agree. The six-grain at Artopolis is just about the only decent non white-bread that I've found here...
