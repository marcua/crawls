				Is there a place in Astoria that sells sourdough bread. I think that Key Food occasionally sells sourdough by Chabasco, but it is a rare find. So far, I have not found a bakery that sells fresh loaves either. Any suggestions?

				Have you thought of getting a sourdough starter so you can make your own whenever you want it? Not the easiest solution to the problem, but the most cost-effective long term.

				&nbsp;If you go into the front door of Best Yet &nbsp;in the 37th and 20th Ave complex, head towards the bakery area (like 2 o&#039;clock on a clockface)....<br />&nbsp;there is a couple of separate displays of loaves (one is a metal display, one a series of woven baskets on an angled table). I have found sourdough loaves there a few times. I do not know the stocking days on items like this. Some days there are loaves stuffed with garlic cloves, olives, cranberry walnut, caraways, etc. That is my best guess.

I would probably end up producing more starter than I could possibly use. I have had the same problem when I had my own kefir culture. I had to produce more kefir than I could possibly imagine drinking.<br /><br />It would be nice if local home bakers could provide their excess loaves to the bakeries, but unfortunately that would be against NYC health laws.

				i&#039;ve found that trader joes makes just about the best san francisco sour dough loaf (ala boudin) i&#039;ve found in the city. it&#039;s a big loaf so maybe that offsets the travel required to pick one up.

				I&#039;m not a sourdough bread expert (which is sad, having lived in Cali), but I&#039;ve tried the Best Yet sourdough and it was pretty tasty. We shop on Sundays and there are usually a few loaves available. Saturdays are probably the big shopping day for most people. The loaf is about 8&quot; round-good sampling size and it won&#039;t break the budget.

				I love sourdough bread myself - I usually pick up a delicious sourdough boule from Whole Foods, and pop it in the freezer.&nbsp; I have it sliced at Whole Foods so I can defrost as many/few slices as I need at a time.&nbsp; I would say the bread keeps for about 2 months in the freezer without tasting funny.

				Two other great sourdough options:<br /><br />1. FreshDirect has Sourdough Pullman loaves (good for sandwiches).&nbsp; It&#039;s not Amy&#039;s-bread good, but it&#039;s good.<br /><br />2. If you are a member of the Hellgate CSA, you can order sourdough bread through the meat and dairy purchasing program.&nbsp; It is from Rock Hill Bakehouse (I think it sometimes is sold at the Union Square farmer&#039;s market), and it&#039;s reallllllllllllllly delish.&nbsp; <br /><br />But I only wish that Rose &amp; Joe&#039;s would carry it.. their bread is great.. but sourdough is my only true love..

				I love that there&#039;s a sourdough bread thread here.&nbsp; I grew up just outside of the Bay Area, so sourdough was a staple for my family.&nbsp; And I&#039;ve had a hard time finding it here in the city, but it&#039;s good to know that Amy&#039;s and Panera&#039;s has it.<br /><br />Anyway, yet another reason why I LOVE astorians.com!
