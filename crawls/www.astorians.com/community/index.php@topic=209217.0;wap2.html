			<br />
			<br />&quot;Come Over For Coffee&quot; is a storytelling home concert in the historic district of Jackson Heights.<br />If you&#039;ve never been to a storytelling home concert before (and most people haven&#039;t!), it&#039;s about 20 people sitting around in a living room (no campfire, sorry!), having refreshments, and listening to people tell true, personal stories from their lives (we&#039;ll also have a folklorist this month.)<br /><br /><br />We have networking so that neighbors can meet one another, and eating, from 5:30pm to 6pm. Then stories from 6:00pm to almost 8:00pm. We request a $20/person donation. <br /><br /><br />Email heightshub@gmail.com for a reservation and our address.
