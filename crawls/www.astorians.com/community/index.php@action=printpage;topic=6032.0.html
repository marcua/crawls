				Hey guys!<br /><br />I&#039;m currently looking at an apartment on 30th Ave. and 14th St.&nbsp; Does anyone know how far from the subway this is, and what the neighborhood&#039;s like?&nbsp; Any input is appreciated!<br /><br />-Emily

				I looked at an apartment in this area once.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t like the area because it seemed awfully desolate at night and not the nicest area.&nbsp; It was my instinct about the area that it wasn&#039;t that safe, but I could be totally wrong.&nbsp; &nbsp; The NW is about a 10 minute walk away, and so are most restaurants and bars.&nbsp; Although that could change in time as Astoria gets more popular.

				I agree with Daisy.&nbsp; Its a bit dodgy there.&nbsp; Used to live nearby and that area was always on the edge of where we&#039;d cut off our evening walks.&nbsp; Pretty tough housing projects close by.&nbsp;

				That area is not nice at all, not to mention there are bugs (i looked at 2 apts over there when i was figuring out Astoria and one, when we turned on the lights in the kitchen about an army of cockroaches came running accross the floor)!!&nbsp; Its kind of ghetto out there too, and the projects are too close for comfort.&nbsp; Not to mention that the walk to the train is really far and if you are coming home late at night, it would suck plus having to cross 21st street.&nbsp; Apart from a bodega and a barber shop here or there, there is not much stores or anything, plus you will find that the price of apts over there are almost the same in the nicer areas of astoria.<br /><br />

				Hmm, well, I checked it out today and the area certainly wasn&#039;t what I had hoped it would be.&nbsp; The apartment, however, was great, so I&#039;ll have to weigh my options.<br /><br />Thanks, folks!

				The area west of 21st Street is not that great, and it is far from the subway, but there are also a LOT of new buildings going up there and a lot of people moving in, so I think it will change fairly fast...

				Anytime where there is alot of unmarked police cars running around in addition to the regular marked police cars is because there are things going on, I never lived in or near projects and rather not.&nbsp; Yeah sometimes you can can get cheaper places with more space, but then again you get what you pay for.<br /><br />I am sure if you asked the people that live in the actual projects, if they like living there they would they would tell you they live there cause they have to, on top of all the crap they have to deal with too.&nbsp; It is a fact that these places are high risk/crime/drugs areas.&nbsp; Nas did his thing to get out of the projects and told you about it he is not living there still.&nbsp; <br /><br />I love Illmatic and Halftime is one of my all time favs!&nbsp; Who&#039;s world is this?&nbsp; The world is Mine is Mine is Mine&nbsp; 8-)

				I lived next to the Woodside Houses for four years, and rarely felt unsafe.&nbsp; But the area is different, and not as industrial as 21St is.&nbsp; There are restaurants, bars and stores in the 50th St/Broadway area, and people are out and about all the time.&nbsp; I have nothing against projects, I&#039;ve grown up around them all my life.&nbsp; I do have something against unsafe areas, and any area that is desolate and full of empty streets and dark alleys and more industrial, is going to make me feel unsafe.

				The walk from any of the subway stations to 21st street and below can be cold, long and lonely. Just something to think about if you like to go out at night or during the winter months, etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-P

				...basically what everyone else has said.<br /><br />I would prefer to not live in a desolate area that might have more crime as I am a 19 year old girl and will be walking home alone late at night.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think I need to explain myself further.

				venus, look around the Broadway/30th ave areas where there is always people around, or Ditmars which is pretty nice but not as busy.&nbsp; The Astoria Blvd stop is ok, but still can get tricky because walking down and crossing the street is kind of crazy over there because of the bridge and grand central traffic.&nbsp; Stick in the areas between 23st and like 40th street and from Ditmars to Broadway stops on the train.&nbsp;
