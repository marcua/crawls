				A city council representative publicly stated this week, so I have heard, that they should vote on this issue, rather than getting the public (meaning their constituents) get involved in the term limits issue. <br /><br />(This is important and frankly a bit surprised its not been mentioned here what with all the careful coverage in threads on fluff issues like real estate, restaurants, and gym memberships)<br /><br />So lets throw this out:<br /><br />1. Should we have a public referendum (for the third time)?<br /><br />2. Should we do nothing and consider the two public votes taken the final say?<br /><br />3. Should we let city council choose for us?<br /><br />&nbsp;:|<br />

				The City Council should definitely not be voting on this themselves.&nbsp; After all, they would potentially stand to gain from extending term limits as well.&nbsp; It reeks of a conflict of interest.&nbsp; Plus, if they do vote to overturn term limits, they&#039;ve voted to overturn the will of the voting public, which has kept those term limits in place in two prior referendums.&nbsp; The proper thing to do would be to hold another referendum.&nbsp; Of course, with councilpeople like Christine Quinn, who supports Bloomberg&#039;s bid for a third term (presumably so she can get another term as Council speaker as well), I don&#039;t exactly have much faith that the Council will do the right thing.<br /><br />However...an even better thing would be for Bloomberg to get off of his high horse and let someone else run.&nbsp; I honestly can&#039;t understand why &quot;Bloomie&quot; is so popular.&nbsp; The guy is an egomaniac and an opportunist, plain and simple, and his argument for wanting to stay in office for a third term (the financial crisis) just doesn&#039;t hold water.&nbsp; It&#039;s ridiculously arrogant of him to try to use his power to extend his mayoral reign, and to claim that he is best suited to manage the city through the economic crisis, when we don&#039;t even know in what state the economy will be in 14 months from now, when his second term finally ends.&nbsp; <br /><br />Not to mention that Bloomberg was *for* term limits before he was *against* term limits, and that just this past week, he was in California helping to campaign on behalf of a measure that would prevent gerrymandering (changing district maps to benefit politicians already in office).&nbsp; He stated that he does not feel politicians should abuse their power to stay in office.&nbsp; Yet that is *exactly* what he is trying to do now by changing the law.<br /><br />The guy is a hypocrite and power-hungry and should learn to bow out gracefully.&nbsp; He had his eight years, let&#039;s have someone new come in now.

				The people of New York have voted twice in support of term limits, so I believe that the politicians should adhere to this.&nbsp; I am not necessarily opposed to extending term limits to a third term, but I do not think it should be pushed through at the last minute as the city council and mayor are attempting to do.&nbsp; They should have another referendum vote, but after this election.&nbsp; <br /><br />In no way should the city council be allowed to choose to extend term limits without input from the people of New York.&nbsp; &nbsp;Close to 70% of the city council members are subject to term limits come November, so how do we think they are going to vote?&nbsp; Conflict of interest anyone?&nbsp; If term limits were a concern for the mayor and city council, they could have brought it up at some time in the past 8 years.

				in my opinion its the people of the great city of new york who voted twice for term limits. than it should be the voters too&nbsp; who make that decision to extent term limits to three terms or keep it at two terms not the city council.

				http://www.nypost.com/seven/10192008/news/regionalnews/3rd_term_is_lush_hour_134241.htm<br /><br />The Post now has a piece claiming that a &#039;slush fund&#039; was set up. A list of city council members include Peter Vallone. <br /><br />Quote<br />Fellow committee members Domenic Recchia, Helen Sears, Erik Dilan and Peter Vallone Jr. each received between $50,000 and $625,000 from the mayor&#039;s fund.. <br /><br /><br />&quot;I think it&#039;s obvious that Bloomberg was trying to curry favor here. What else are discretionary funds for?&quot; said one councilman against extending term limits. &quot;Term limits is the most important issue out there, period . . . I think this is one way he laid the groundwork.&quot; <br />Unquote&quot;<br /><br />Peter should come clean with the community and explain this.

				My partner and I just called Vallone&#039;s office to add our objection to what Mayor Bloomberg is trying to do. <br /><br />For me, it isn&#039;t even a matter of what one feels about Term Limits. It&#039;s this end run around the current law to support the ambitions of ONE MAN. <br /><br />And I can&#039;t help but feel anger over the thought of two billionaires hatching a plan in the back offices of City Hall. If that doesn&#039;t make every supporter of democracy anger.....nothing will.<br /><br />Call Vallone&#039;s office and voice your opinion. <br /><br />718-274-4500

The Borough-wide office will be there when the term limit is up again next round.&nbsp; Vallone makes what $112k for being a council member and $18k as chair of the Public Safety Committee and was about to be termed out... do you really think he would turn down another chance to make $130k as councilmember?<br /><br />Look for those who are going to be termed out (especially those who are chairs of comittees) to vote in favor of the a &quot;one time&quot; term limit extension.&nbsp; Those who want those jobs and would not get the benefit of a 3rd term will likely vote no.&nbsp; The rest will be bought for and paid by the Speaker and the Mayor.

				Here is the letter I sent to Vallone...for what it&#039;s worth.....<br /><br />Dear Councilmember Vallone, <br /><br />I am writing this letter to inform you of my absolute anger at your vote yesterday to extent the term limits to 3 terms for the Mayor of New York City and coincidently, yourself. And please don’t tell me you did not calculate the advantage this would give you if you win a third term. <br /><br />This letter is not about whether terms limits are right or wrong. I myself have mixed feelings about that. This is about the will of the people.<br /><br />You stated, according to the New York Times, that your vote was not about one man but for the city itself. I could not disagree more. Your vote was in support of a plan hatched by two billionaires in the back rooms of City Hall. You, after a meeting with the mayor, cast a vote that goes against the will of the voters. <br /><br />Ultimately, you, a citizen of Astoria, have been bought and paid for by two billionaire elites from the Upper East Side. So, I must ask, what did Mayor Bloomberg promise you during that meeting: a seat at the charter revision committee in 2010 like he did Ronald Lauder? <br /><br />How dare you go against the will of the voters. And please don’t give some argument that you did it for the good of the people during this crisis. That is a subjective argument that is based on the hope that Mayor Bloomberg will do a good job. <br /><br />Come on. How can that not make you sick? A deal between two billionaires that changed a law the voters approved. <br /><br />It comes down to this. You, as a representative of the citizens of Astoria, cast a vote that subverted the will of the people. And in doing so, you benefited yourself. And that, to me, is the mark of a politician who does not stand up for his constituents but for himself. And therefore, as long as I live in Astoria, I will never cast a vote for you again. <br /><br />

				This again, and again, and again. Will voters forget about the term limit void travesty or are voters happy to keep the gang back for another go?<br /><br />I would love it if all the 2 term incumbents were voted out. But that is another unlikely dream.<br /><br />In a different cold month, voters will choose several officers including Public Advocate.<br />Norman Siegel has run before without much luck.

				I could see the bill passing both the Assembly and the Senate, but I hear Paterson is likely to veto it - he doesn&#039;t need Bloomberg forced out of office and running against him.<br /><br />Did people see Mark Green is trying to come back as Public Advocate?&nbsp; What do folks make of that?

				the field in that race is really shaping up to be an interesting one - City Councilmembers Eric Gioia, John Liu and Bill DeBlasio, Norman Siegel and now Mark Green.&nbsp; Hard to say who will take it.&nbsp; I can&#039;t get going back to your old office - it seems so dated.
