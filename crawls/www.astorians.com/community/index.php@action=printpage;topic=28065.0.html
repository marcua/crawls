				Where do you stand on the controversy of Master Softee vs Mister Softee.<br /><br /><br />I think that Master Softee will lose in the end big time. It is an obvious infringement on the copywrite of mister softee.<br /><br /><br />But the products are practically the same to me.<br /><br /><br />Anyone notice any difference in taste between the two?

				Last night my girlfriend and I rocketed out of the house when we heard that classic Mister Softee music. As we were walking to the truck, I told her about the Mister Softee impersonators, and she asked a few questions to which I didn&#039;t know; What&#039;s the logo look like? Is the music the same? etc.<br /><br /><br />Then we ordered and saw that is was MASTER Softee!! I was blown away that the guy on our block was one of the fakes. <br /><br /><br />Then I saw that his food license, hanging on the outside of the truck, expired a year ago. #greatjob

				I too got suckered by a Master Softee truck playing the Mister Softee jingle.&nbsp; This one was parked on the corner of 7th Avenue and 57th Street and there was another one over on 8th and 57th.&nbsp; I&#039;d already gotten my cone before I saw the fake logo.&nbsp; And to make things even worse, the guy charged more and gave me less ice cream than a real Mister Softee would have.

				I&#039;m a fan of ice cream in general. Master Softee might be a knockoff but he serves good ice cream at affordable prices. I don&#039;t see anything wrong with capitalizing on an existing brand. This goes on in every industry. If you like it or don&#039;t, then vote with your wallet.

				The truck outside TD is usually Mister Softee, but sometimes the Master Softee guy gets there first, Master Softee has a distinct funky aftertaste you don&#039;t get with the real deal. You can call it capitalizing all you want but when you change one letter in a name using the same font and color and only slightly change your logo (chocolate ice cream in a pointy cone as opposed to vanilla ice cream in a flat bottomed cone; yes i know the difference) then you are blantently trying to fool the public.
