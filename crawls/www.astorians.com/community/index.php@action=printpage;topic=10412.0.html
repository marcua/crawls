				i thought metro cards gave you&nbsp; 1 free bus&nbsp; to subway or 1 free subway to bus. i did the latter tonight but was charged when i got on the bus.&nbsp; the driver just shrugged his shoulders.

				Subway to bus is always a free transfer (possible exception: express buses).&nbsp; The driver should have told you to contact the MTA.&nbsp; You can get a postage-free envelope at a token-booth, or whatever we call them now.&nbsp; As per the instructions on the envelope, you tell them aproximately what time you got off the train and what time you got on the bus - presumably you spent less than 2 hours on the train and were therefore within the free transfer period.<br /><br />As for buses - if you pay in coin, you get a free transfer, but it&#039;s only good for another bus!&nbsp; I have no idea why it can&#039;t be used on a train!<br /><br />http://www.mta.nyc.ny.us/metrocard/problems.htm (http://www.mta.nyc.ny.us/metrocard/problems.htm)

				I&#039;ve had the same problem on the Q66.&nbsp; Those old Grumman buses they pushed back into service have (older?) card readers that deducted again after a subway trip.<br /><br />- Cannibal<br />This has gotten me so worried as to never used anything other than an unlimited ride Metrocard in buses.

				I was getting money out of the ATM the other day, and something fell out of my wallet.&nbsp; The guy at the ATM next to me looked down and said, &quot;hey, you dropped a token.&quot;&nbsp; I looked down, saw the token, said, oh, thanks, and bent down to get it.&nbsp; Picked it up, and was halfway to putting it back into my wallet before I realised the time warp.&nbsp; It was a Mexican peso from our recent trip, not a token.&nbsp; I fooled him and he fooled me.<br /><br />Transfers aren&#039;t what they used to be.
