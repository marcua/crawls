				I was in a taxi today going down my block... and on 23rd Ave and Steinway (a bar called Eternity I never saw a soul in, recently had a new sign called &quot;Senior Slushee&quot; go up....) had a huge gay flag hanging down the front.&nbsp; It&#039;s just around the corner from Albatross... anyone know what is going on?

				I dunno, from what I&#039;ve seen, there aren&#039;t many gay bars in Astoria. Maybe they decided to fill an empty niche. <br />And yes, they never looked like they seemed to have any business, so maybe it will help. Didn&#039;t that place used to be a strip club or something?

				On Steinway Street between 23rd ave and Astoria Blvd.&nbsp; there is a club called ETERNITY!&nbsp; They are trying to get a GAY NIGHT (SUNDAYS)&nbsp; up and going.&nbsp; It&#039;s a cut venue.&nbsp; The Music needs to change...which I believe is happening...however,&nbsp; it should be a great place for groups to come hang out.&nbsp; It&#039;s low-key and the staff is nice.&nbsp;

				I really don&#039;t get why when a bar wants to have a gay night they always pick an &quot;off night&quot;.&nbsp; Is our money not good enough to have a Thursday night or weekend night for that matter?&nbsp; While I appreciate the effort to have an alternative to the Albatross I sometimes feel like bars in this area just want us to help their bottom line on quieter nights.<br /><br />Cliq and the place across the street had the right idea when they had Thursday nights as gay night.<br /><br />Just putting my two cents in.

				It&#039;s OK with me, my &#039;beef&#039; with any of&nbsp; these Clubs/Bars&nbsp; opening everywhere is&nbsp; the loud crowds outside and people who think my&nbsp; yard is a&nbsp; urinal.&nbsp; :x&nbsp; Living close&nbsp; to any&nbsp; bar or club can be annoying, especially when folks spill out at 3am and think the whole&nbsp; neighborhood is in on the party. :-( I have no problem with who the bar or club is catering too, I just wish&nbsp; there was some&nbsp; way to get through folks, Gay, Bi, Transgender,Straight, there are people&nbsp; living nearby, please&nbsp; do not scream at the top of your lungs outside&nbsp; when you leave. Thanks :-)
