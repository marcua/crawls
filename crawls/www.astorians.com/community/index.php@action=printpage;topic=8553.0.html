				Wow, they showed an x-ray of the girl on that video. I hadn&#039;t seen that before. It looked like the failed twin was joined at the pelvis, with the spines fused end-to-end, and with the failed twin completely headless. The girl is very lucky to have been successfully born at all, and even more lucky to have been aided by some very talented surgeons.

				she looked like an octapus...poor girl.&nbsp; <br /><br />but from what they said, this girl was treated as a goddess in her village.&nbsp; i think i read that all the babies born in that village were revered by the community.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=8553.msg100851.html#msg100851">Quote from: pleated_coke_pants on November 09, 2007, 03:55:31 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It&#039;s Vishnu reincarnated!.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>i thought the same thing when i first read about her.<br /><br /><br />also, as a girl in india, she was lucky that her parents cared enough about her to get her help.

Aware of what? That there&#039;s a girl born with a physical deformity? It happens all the time, all over the world.<br /><br />It&#039;s heartening to learn though that her operation was a success -- apparently without the surgery it was unlikely she would live beyond childhood.

				I just don&#039;t understand the need for spreading these stories. I mean, yes it&#039;s phenominal the variations that can occur with regards to the human body and it&#039;s wonderful the physicians can save her, but doesn&#039;t it feel a bit sensational to gawk at the girl?
