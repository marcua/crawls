				Story in Western Queens Gazette today says it plain as day. A new six-story, 272 unit Hotel with retail in the bottom going up on that block. Gone will be the Halal chicken joint and taxi/car repair places on the block. And just like a silent conspiracy, that store is empty today - signs up, shelves gone! Western Beef was good for certain sales ($4.99 roasted chicken All Summer, but supermarket neglected to use food service ties to keep the legs together, instead using Staples rubber bands). So this will drive more customers to Food Bazaar or Organic Met Foods. While the world still continues to pray for a Whole Foods in the new building replacing the strip joint on 35th and Steinway, I will mourn the loss of that giant cold room at Western Beef. A room so big and so cold you can store meat in it, and they did!

				I&#039;d rather see Trader Joe&#039;s than Whole Foods personally..... The hipster / post-hipster crowds probably get both though soon enough, with accompanying hikes in cost.

				I like TJ&#039;s and WF but what&#039;s wrong with Food Bazaar?&nbsp; <br />I think we&#039;re lucky to have a clean, organized supermarket in this part of the neighborhood - worlds better than the former Pathmark.<br />People in the super expensive waterfront towers of LIC would kill to have a store like Food Bazaar.

				Link to the article was a little hard to find so here it is from Sept 14:<br /><br /><br />http://www.qgazette.com/news/2016-09-14/Features/Plan_272Unit_Hotel_Retail_At_Western_Beef_Site.html (http://www.qgazette.com/news/2016-09-14/Features/Plan_272Unit_Hotel_Retail_At_Western_Beef_Site.html)<br /><br /><br />A slightly more recent article from Sept 21 has a rendering of the hotel - not very attractive in my opinion:<br />http://www.qgazette.com/news/2016-09-21/Features/Steinway_Street_Hotel_Revealed.html (http://www.qgazette.com/news/2016-09-21/Features/Steinway_Street_Hotel_Revealed.html)<br /><br /><br />I&#039;d personally prefer not to have a hotel at that site since we have the Paper House Hotel just 3 blocks away and just from passing by frequently, I don&#039;t think their level of occupancy is very high.<br /><br />The Mercedes dealership is building 80 condos a few blocks away - much better to have permanent residents that have some stake in the community than a hotel (that could at any moment turn into a homeless shelter like the Verve Hotel not far away).

				builder puts &quot;Hotel&quot; on application. Great! tourist dollars. As soon as it&#039;s done, he offers it to the city as a shelter. Since he can get more per night from the city than a tourist, there&#039;s no incentive to actually run a hotel. Plus there&#039;s no cleaning staff to pay.<br /><br /><br />Until the city closes this loophole, it will be homeless shelter city with no real places for tourists. Making REAL hotel rooms even pricier.

It has already happened with some of the newer hotels built north of Queens Plaza, most notably The Verve which has had several violent incidents.

				Regarding the Verve Hotel, you might want to read this editorial from the Queens Gazette.<br /><br /><br />http://www.qgazette.com/news/2016-11-16/Editorials/Whats_Going_On_Here.html (http://www.qgazette.com/news/2016-11-16/Editorials/Whats_Going_On_Here.html)<br /><br /><br /><br />
