				I&#039;m looking for various types of &quot;Green&quot; cleaners that are better for the environment and less toxic to myself as a human being. (Better late than never)<br /><br />Anyway - will need some for&nbsp; areas like bathroom and tub where mold and fungi may crop up (tough, anti bacterial and &quot;green&quot;)<br /><br />Any product recommendations and retailer in real life and/or online would be appreciated.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Good on ya!&nbsp; I&#039;m switching over to natural cleaners too.&nbsp; I&#039;m replacing all my cleaners as the run out.&nbsp; Here&#039;s a brief review of what I&#039;ve tried so far:<br /><br />Holy Cow All Purpose Degreaser (it&#039;s bright pink with a dancing cow on the label) is pretty amazing...works great in both the kitchen and bathroom.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also used it on really stubborn set-in grease spots on my husband&#039;s shirts, and it even worked great on them!&nbsp; I originally bought it at Berry Fresh Market (43rd and Ditmars), but they didn&#039;t have any this past Sunday when I went back for more.&nbsp; They also make a window cleaner and a concentrated multipurpose cleaner, but I haven&#039;t tried them yet.&nbsp; Has anyone see this product anywhere else?&nbsp; They have a website, but I&#039;d rather shop locally.<br /><br />Bon Ami Cleanser is a good powder cleanser that I use for the tub..it&#039;s cheap, natural, does the job, and easy to find.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Natrics makes a good toilet bowl cleaner, but I haven&#039;t tried their other products.&nbsp; I also haven&#039;t seen them locally.<br /><br />I&#039;m still looking for a good dish washing detergent (for hand washing)...I&#039;ve tried Seventh Generation, Trader Joe&#039;s, and Planet, but none of the natural ones cut grease as well as I&#039;m used to or get sudsy enough for my liking.&nbsp; Planet is the best so far, but still kind of...eh.&nbsp; Anyone have any suggestions on that front?
