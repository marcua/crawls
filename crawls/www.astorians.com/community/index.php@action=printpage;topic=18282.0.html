				So I&#039;ve had some bad luck with buying my girlfriend jewelry.&nbsp; The first time I tried a local place (Golden Nugget on Broadway which is going out of business) and she didn&#039;t like the earrings I got her.&nbsp; The other problem was they only give store credit so I ended up getting my mom something there instead.<br /><br />Then I found a necklace at JCPenney that she absolutely loved.&nbsp; The problem?&nbsp; The chain has broken four separate times.&nbsp; I have the extended warranty so they keep replacing it but it keeps breaking.&nbsp; Her thought is that it&#039;s because it&#039;s poorly made which it doesn&#039;t look like but apparently is.<br /><br />So I am looking for suggestions on jewelry stores you all may have shopped at in the past and had good experiences.&nbsp; I am returning the JCPenney necklace and going elsewhere.&nbsp; I am looking to get her another necklace.&nbsp; Thanks for your help!

				With the bad luck you&#039;ve had at JC Penney, you might have a hard time trusting Sears (on Queens Blvd) but I&#039;ve bought a lot of gemstone gold jewelry from them and I don&#039;t believe I&#039;ve ever had a problem.&nbsp; Try to shop on weekends, things really do go off sale during the week, unless stated in an ad/posted at the counter.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also done well with my stuff from Macy&#039;s.&nbsp; You might also be interested in the 22k gold jewelry sold at the Indian stores in Jackson Heights.<br /><br />As for Penney&#039;s, try to find a corporate phone number and tell someone higher up about the problems you&#039;ve been having; they might get you a new chain.

				Why don&#039;t you try the jewelry district on 47th Street between 5th &amp; 6th Aves.? <br />That&#039;s where you get the best selection and deals. I used to have a wonderful jeweler there,<br />but he retired awhile ago. Maybe someone here has a person/shop they can recommend there&nbsp; -- <br />I&#039;d be interested too. <br /><br />I think you&#039;d have better luck. Even if you don&#039;t get a recommendation, you can just go and browse a couple<br />of the shops and get an idea of what&#039;s on offer. <br />
