				Good article by David Leonhardt in the Times today;<br />http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/22/business/economy/22leonhardt.html<br /><br />But look at the chart at the top. The price to income ratio is currently in NY is 6.9, over double the national average and the highest in the country. A sustainable housing market is usually around 3x income and no more than 4x. Prices will continue to decline until they are affordable to the income of the buyers. And with high unemployment and stagnant wages we have a long way down to the bottom. I see a fall of another 40% minimum.<br /><br />I think his final line is quite succinct.<br />&quot; So if you are part of the 30 percent of American households who rent and youâ€™re trying to decide when to buy, relax.<br />The market is still coming your way.&quot;<br />

				I wonder if it&#039;s a bit more complicated than just a single number. New York is a weird market, since it includes a huge high-end sector in Manhattan, but also a much larger proportion of condos and (often owner-occupied) multi-family dwellings compared to other markets, which have more single-family homes. My vague uninformed understanding (please correct me if I&#039;m wrong!) is that prices in Manhattan are down drastically, but this is much less true for middle-of-the-range stuff around here. I suspect you&#039;re right overall, but I&#039;m not sure that it&#039;s true for both high-end and low-end real estate. Anyone have P/I charts for NYC at various price/borough brackets? <br /><br />(It&#039;s also true that despite the Wall Street collapse, NYC&#039;s economy is doing relatively less-bad, compared with areas with economies based on manufacturing and construction. So there may be less of an income drop, supporting less of a RE price drop here than elsewhere...)

				From the Miller Samuel report.<br />&quot;Although the number of properties available for sale declined 7% to 10,421 from 11,206 listings in the same period last year, inventory expanded 6.1% from the prior quarter total of 9,822. The rise in inventory levels from the prior quarter was the result of the sharp decline in the number of sales over the same period. There were 1,801 sales in the first quarter, down 52.2% from 3,771 sales in the same period last year and down 34.2% from 2,737 sales in the prior quarter. The number of sales tends to decline from the fourth quarter to the first quarter of any given year, however, the decline during this period of the year was more than twice the five year average of 12.6% and outside of the five year range of -9.3% to -16.4%. The weakening regional economy and credit crunch as restricted the level of sales activity in the Queens housing market. Sellers continue to price property &quot;behind&quot; the market. As a result, the absorption rate - the number of months it would take to sell off existing inventory at the current pace of sales - has more than doubled over the past year. The absorption rate was 17.4 months in the first quarter, up from 8.9 months in the same period last year, both well above the 6.8 monthly average of the past five years... &quot;<br /><br />That is an indication of a very sick market. From what I&#039;ve seen median prices are still around $450K for a house which is about 10x median income in Queens. ($44K)<br />And while NY has not had as bad a downturn yet, past downturns have had a bigger impact on NY than other regions, it&#039;s still a long way to go before thing stop falling and start coming back.<br />(I believe the Stock Market is a classic Bear Rally).

				EH,<br />Thanks for the articles, they are generally interesting.&nbsp; &nbsp;:mrgreen:<br />Are you expecting to see more of the same in 2010, 2012, and beyond? Will keep reading for future reports.<br /><br /><br />Might have missed it but I was curious whether your interest in this area is personal, professional, academic, ...<br />To me just find interesting how reports are presented and math applied.<br /><br />I have been finding many conflicting reports regarding real estate and understand very little of many of them.<br />And broadly, if 49% of housing prices went up and 51% went down should it not be said that housing prices are falling.<br /><br />The main point suggested is buyers need not rush. (For those who could)<br />Or perhaps you believe real estate is currently a bad investment.<br /><br /><br />Curiosity continues<br />&nbsp;:-)<br /><br /><br />

				At some point, when prices are sane, I would like to buy. That might not be for another 18 to 24 months.

				So let me get this straight , if say im looking at a house in bayside or whitestone going for around 500k , u think it will drop another 40% ?&nbsp; So it would go down to almost half of that ?&nbsp; I cant see that happening , and since nyc is a weird market compared to almost every other place , thats a hard hit to expect .&nbsp; Lets see ....

				Why not? It&#039;s happened most other places. Our price to income ratio is way out of whack. Banks are back to only lending for houses that are no more than 4x income. So if the average price is $500K, only those that make at least $125K will be able to buy. Do you think there are enough families with that income to buy the 17 months of inventory in Queens?<br />Remember there was a similar drop in the 90s and the previous bubble was much smaller than this one.

				If that house&nbsp; in whitestone im looking at for 500k drops by 40%&nbsp; then it will be selling for 300k&nbsp; . Sound very very near to impossible . Hey its great to wish , but no way do i see it happening . And saying only those who make 125k can afford it ? well yes , ny is for the rich and it seems to become more and more like that each year .Everything is going up and will continue to do so until everyone poor is out and the middle class gets squeezed.&nbsp; Thats why 40k people alone moved to Nc and Atl&nbsp; to find housing at a much cheaper rate .&nbsp; &nbsp;So unless you can somehow save a great downpayment with a partner perhaps , housing in nyc wont be easy .&nbsp; &nbsp;Hey , im wishing houses do come down , dont get me wrong , but i dont see it dropping by much even after all this time . Imagine went things start going good again , how prices will jump in the areas that barely have been affected .

It then grew into the biggest bubble in world history.<br />Second, if a house cost $5,000 50 years ago and doubled every 5 years, it would now be worth over $5,000,000. (5,000 x2, x2, x2.... you can do the math)<br />And we can add periods in the 70s and 90s when prices fell up to 50%.<br /><br />Do you think the small, wood-sided, 80 year old single family homes that people in Astoria are trying to sell for $600,000 will be worth $1,200,000 in 5 years?<br /><br /><br /><br />

				All good points by posters on this thread.<br /><br />While I recognize the points made in the Times article, I&#039;m not so sure one can apply the same potential impact to certain NYC areas - Queens included. In Manhattan, many renters are seeing their rents renegotiated to lower prices upon renewal. A childhood friend of mine recently had his monthly rate lowered from 4k to $3,250. And no - his parking is separate and remains the same lol.<br /><br />When home and condo/co-op sales drop in most areas, don&#039;t rents normally respond inversely? That really doesn&#039;t happen in NYC. When sales prices fall, we&#039;re seeing rents become cheaper. This also happened in the City in the early 1990s from what I understand. When recessions occur, many professional types without work living in NYC return to their home states until the job market stabilizes.<br /><br />In my unprofessional opinion, people love to buy on momentum. It makes them feel like they&#039;re on the winning team. Buying low doesn&#039;t provide much company.<br /><br />Anyway - I&#039;m not tossing any chips into the pot unless I have an inheritance I don&#039;t know about.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

				There was a report once in the NewYork Newsday that said the avg 2 family house in Astoria goes up around 80-100k a year . At the time , (this was like 3 yrs ago it seemed to be true as i did the math ) . Now ofcourse not much is going up , but if it doesnt drop by much or maybe a little , then once things start going good again&nbsp; the in demand places like Astoria are gonna jump up like they did in from 2002-2007.

It is lunacy to think that there will be a return to 10% to 20% annual increases. For the previous 100 years, the average increase was 2%. You seem to be stuck in the mindset that house prices don&#039;t fall. This led us into the problem in the first place.<br />Do the math. How do you expect for people in an area like Queens with a median income is around $45,000 to pay for houses that are $600,000 to $1,000,000. <br />Look at any of the normal metrics for housing prices. Rent to own, income to price. Inventory vs demand. Houses are grossly overpriced.

				I&#039;ve posted this before but Astoria house prices do go down. During the last crash in the late 80-90s houses prices declined 25-30% and took nearly 10 years to recover. <br /><br />I&#039;m surprised this time around that prices haven&#039;t come down more than they have but I think demand in the New York market overall was buoyed by overseas buyers for a while. Now that the world economy has tanked I don&#039;t think this will continue.

				Exactly my point . People with the avg 45k income CANT buy those 600k-1mil homes in Astoria . Not saying this in a negative way but more in a realistic way . If buying was that easy ,everyone would just buy and there would be no renters . Yes homes are grossly overpriced , just like almost everything is in NYC . Again its&nbsp; supply and demand . In a high demand area as Astoria has become in the last 10 or so yrs , the prices remain pretty much stable and after this is over , they will go up like they did in the 60&#039;s 70&#039;s 80&#039; 90&#039;s and 00&#039;s.&nbsp; &nbsp;Once again my parents bought their 2 family in 1973 on Ditmars for 45k . Sure plenty of people told them , thats outrageous and it will drop for sure . Well in the late 80&#039;s&nbsp; the same houses went for abt 250k .....then in the 90&#039;s&nbsp; 400k&nbsp; &nbsp;...early 00&#039;s 600k and now&nbsp; 800-900k . If you want to say it might drop for a bit during tough times , fine , but eventually they have all gone up . I dont see any house around here going back to 70&#039;s or 80&#039;s prices , sorry .

				I agree, prices in Astoria will remain the same more or less for a number of years but they will not drop more than 10% additionally to the 10% drop that they had so far from 2006.<br /><br />Also because of the price drop and the crisis in general you will see the sale volume in Astoria to be considerably lower than other neighborhoods<br />

There&#039;s no way a 1980s 250K house was worth 400K in the 1990s. Simply not possible unless it was an extra special property.<br /><br />Yes, in the long run prices recovered and increased greatly during the bubble but if someone bought at the top of the market in 87 and had to sell anytime before 1997, they could have very well lost money.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know what will happen this time around, I don&#039;t know anyone who does, but if rental prices in Manhattan continue to drop there&#039;s no way rental prices will stay as high as they are now in Astoria -- and it&#039;s rental income that are keeping prices up. <br /><br />
