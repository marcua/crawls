				You&#039;ve all seen the sad commercials and the pleas from Marlo Thomas.&nbsp; Well - my family has a long history of supporting organizations that help children who are ill and disabled.&nbsp; For the first time, we added St. Jude&#039;s to the list and sent a generous donation.&nbsp; From there the story turns ugly.&nbsp; First came the phone calls from a 901 number day and night - AND on Saturdays and Sundays.&nbsp; No human on the line.&nbsp; It&#039;s computer dialed and the messages is a recording with prompts.&nbsp; And EVERY DAY it appeared on our caller ID.&nbsp; It&#039;s St. Jude&#039;s asking for more money.&nbsp; Then came the mail (paper).&nbsp; From them and from every other children&#039;s charity known to man.&nbsp; I called their 800 number and calmly told the nice woman on the phone how upset I was about this and that I would never contribute again since they spam you by phone, mail and likely sell your information to others.&nbsp; She asked for my name, address and phone so she can remove me from all their lists&nbsp; :-o&nbsp; All their lists?&nbsp; I gave her no information but I gave her plenty of 4 letter words.<br /><br />I am not giving up on charities.&nbsp; But as mean as this may sound after seeing those dramatic commercials, I will never give a single cent to St. Jude&#039;s ever again.&nbsp; And unless you want your phone ringing off the hook, you might think twice about donating yourself.<br /><br />It&#039;s a poor sign of the times, I suppose.&nbsp; &nbsp;Charities are exempt from the Do Not Call list.&nbsp; And they take full advantage of this.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had similar calls on weekends from animal shelters we donate to, including the North Shore Animal League.&nbsp; I love the things these groups do.&nbsp; But wake me up at 10am on Saturday to ask for more money and you&#039;ve just made yourself an enemy for life.&nbsp; It&#039;s a real shame to think of the money they lost by harassing people like this.&nbsp; And the damage they did to their good name.&nbsp; How utterly stupid - and greedy.<br /><br />No need to reply saying that I should continue to contribute to charities.&nbsp; Of course we will.&nbsp; But anonymously.&nbsp; Or in person or by letter - so we can clearly state that our donations will stop permanently and immediately if we are ever contacted by telephone or email.

				Ugh. I feel your pain. <br /><br />However, as someone who has worked in online fundraising for the last few years, you have to be careful of a couple of things (this is coming from the online perspective, but could be applicable to mail as well).<br /><br />First off, charities are supposed to provide you with an &quot;opt-out&quot; option on internet forms, and an unsubscribe link in <strong>any</strong> email correspondence that you receive. The &quot;opt-out&quot; means that you can easily say no to further emails and/or mail from this organization. There are a lot of people like you that want to donate once and only once, but it is extremely easy to miss that checkbox or accidentally check that box.<br /><br />If you do wind up receiving unwanted emails from them or other charities they will (almost) always have an unsubscribe link. Some organizations have the option for you to unsubscribe from ALL communications or just from the current campaign or enewsletter you are receiving. The systems are not perfect so there can be glitches, or if you have managed to sign yourself up multiple times for different things you may appear in their system multiple times which means it can be harder to remove you. Meaning - you&#039;ll be less of a happy camper.<br /><br />Additionally, many charities put their donors into various segments. So if you donate between $1 and $250 you may get dropped into a certain list, and if you donate $1,000+ you may get dropped into another. If you were very generous then you will be approached differently than someone who donated $5. You are seen as someone who can potentially give generously again.<br /><br />One problem that some donors face, which sounds like happened to you, is that lists are often sold between charities. In this case, if you are considering making a donation to a charity, I would recommend that you first look at their privacy policy. If they say something along the lines of &quot;we respect your privacy, and your information is not shared with other organizations&quot; then you can expect that they will not sell your name.<br /><br />HOWEVER - with that said, some organizations have departments that don&#039;t get it and who do things on their own (i.e. they decide to start their own newsletter and have their own list which they may share with other organizations), so while the privacy policy should ideally guarantee that you won&#039;t be approached by other organizations, it doesn&#039;t always guarantee it.<br /><br />I would also suggest that in cases like this where you think you have been wronged you should file a complaint (http://www.ftc.gov/spam/) with the FTC. It is through this sort of thing that NPOs and other organizations that email their contacts can know that it is necessary to clean up their act. Organizations are supposed to be bound by the CAN-SPAM Act (http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/buspubs/canspam.shtm), however many do not know about it or understand it, so I imagine that we&#039;ll continue to run into this sort of thing for a while yet.<br /><br />Finally, a word on mail. I have never worked in direct mail, however, I have noticed that many pieces of mail have ways that you can opt-out, but it is typically more involved than just checking a box online. You have to usually call or mail them back, which can be a hassle.<br /><br />I could go on and on and on about the flaws in the system, but bottom line is that as a donor or internet user you have ways that you can fight or avoid this.

				Thanks!&nbsp; That&#039;s terrific information.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t necessarily plan to do a one time only donation.&nbsp; And we&#039;re fine with an occasional mailing directly from them to see if we might want to help again.&nbsp; But for some reason I take great offense to them looking up my home phone number and then calling me litterally 7 days a week.&nbsp; And then selling my information.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t care how much good work they do, what they do to their donors sucks.&nbsp; Plain and simple.<br /><br />My wife also found this site that was helpful.&nbsp; We followed all the links to get our names taken off various lists.&nbsp; We&#039;ll see if it works.&nbsp; <br /><br />http://www.charitywatch.org/articles/seventips.html<br /><br />Sad day when we have to think twice about making a donation because we could be overwhelmed with contacts from not only them but everyone like them.<br /><br />Imagine all the people even madder than me who will never contribute to a charity again.&nbsp; I bet the number is staggering.&nbsp; I&#039;m actually going to specify St. Jude&#039;s to these opt out groups.&nbsp; Once you do a little digging, you find that St. Jude&#039;s has a very bad reputation for this kind of thing.&nbsp; I feel foolish for falling for the whole St. Jude&#039;s thing.&nbsp; At least now I will watch the commercials at Christmas completely guilt free.

				Through www.charitynavigator.org you can make an anonymous donation and I think you still get a receipt for tax records

				Also, for what it&#039;s worth - I used to know this guy who really hated junk mail. when he got junk mail with a postage-prepaid envelope, he would stuff it with whatever crap he could find - pencil shavings, other junk mail, etc - and put it in the mail. he claimed this helped.

It doesn&#039;t help. <br />I get a LOT of junk mail, but it&#039;s my own fault - I sign up for free samples online and this is what happens, but it doesn&#039;t really bother me much. I usually throw the crap mail into a drawer, and every once in a while I will open it, and the ones that have prepaid return envelopes get stuffed with letters from other charities asking for money or that type of thing. I recently sent a Planned Parenthood flyer type thing asking for money for something to a credit card processing center in Texas. I hope I pissed off a crazy pro-lifer, and didn&#039;t just irritate and nice person (pro life or not) No matter how often you do this, it won&#039;t help. I wrote a letter to Wamu once threatening to close my account with them if they send me another piece of junk mail. That didn&#039;t work either. <br /><br />As far as harassment from charities you&#039;ve donated to, I <strong><em>never </em></strong> give anyone my real phone number. The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society has sent me more goddamned address stamps than I could ever possibly use. I throw them out as the come in, because I have too many! They&#039;ve also mailed me an actual real nickel. Twice. THAT was insulting. It was like &#039;if you mail back this nickel, with a contribution, it will help cancer research!&#039; and it&#039;s like well if you want money for research stop sending people nickels! Sure enough, on the back of the page with the address stickers, on the bottom in tiny print it reads: &#039;Occasionally LLS shares its mailing list with other non-profits. If you do not wish for us to include your name on these lists, please write to us at: ....&#039;<br />

				Someone else said something that made sense to me.&nbsp; Charity starts at home.&nbsp; I think we may switch to giving primarily to local causes.&nbsp; The Animal Medical Center in NYC was very good to us - well our pet mostly.&nbsp; I can easily drop by and give a donation in person and they will give me a receipt.&nbsp; The same for many other organizations.&nbsp; I am willing to visit in person.&nbsp; And I would give cash or - in person - it&#039;s more likely that you can insist on privacy.&nbsp; And hopefully the person accepting the donation will honor that request.&nbsp; Most large organizations accept anonymous donations.&nbsp; Though they know who you are and might hound you forever.&nbsp; &nbsp;I will no longer do anything at all by mail.&nbsp; Nor online.&nbsp; There&#039;s too much information being exchanged and you just become a &quot;donor&quot; and get put in &quot;the system&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;This whole thing is yet another wake up call about safeguarding your identity.&nbsp; And that many good deeds do get punished.&nbsp; But I&#039;m very good at finding unusual workarounds.
