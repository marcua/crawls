				<strong>Bush Overstated Iraq Evidence, Senators Report </strong> <br /><br />http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/06/world/middleeast/06intel.html? (http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/06/world/middleeast/06intel.html?)<br /><br />By MARK MAZZETTI and SCOTT SHANE<br /><em>WASHINGTON — A long-delayed Senate committee report endorsed by Democrats and some Republicans concluded that President Bush and his aides built the public case for war against Iraq by exaggerating available intelligence and by ignoring disagreements among spy agencies about Iraq’s weapons programs and Saddam Hussein’s links to Al Qaeda.<br /><br />The report was released Thursday after years of partisan squabbling, and it represented the close of five years of investigations by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence into the use, abuse and faulty assessments of intelligence leading to the invasion of Iraq in March 2003. <br /><br />That some Bush administration claims about the Iraqi threat turned out to be false is hardly new. But the report, based on a detailed review of public statements by Mr. Bush and other officials, was the most comprehensive effort to date to assess whether policy makers systematically painted a more dire picture about Iraq than was justified by the available intelligence. <br /><br />The 170-page report accuses Mr. Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and other top officials of repeatedly overstating the Iraqi threat in the emotional aftermath of the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Its findings were endorsed by all eight committee Democrats and two Republicans, Senators Olympia J. Snowe of Maine and Chuck Hagel of Nebraska. <br /><br />In a statement accompanying the report, Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, the West Virginia Democrat who is chairman of the intelligence panel, said, “The president and his advisers undertook a relentless public campaign in the aftermath of the attacks to use the war against Al Qaeda as a justification for overthrowing Saddam Hussein.” </em> <br /><br />The rest of the article is at the above link.

				Yeah, seriously. You wouldn&#039;t know it to be a fact if you listened to or read newspapers or media news. It took years, but the vast majority of the American public now believe it. This is the first time our senate (or their appointed committee) has actually stated this. <br /><br />

Seriously, to say&nbsp; that&nbsp; agencies were not working together, when war opponents have fought tooth and nail , against them &#039;working together&#039; for&nbsp; decades is bad enough. It&#039;s even worse to make continuing veiled&nbsp; allegations&nbsp; against&nbsp; the President and really anyone who supported&nbsp; the removal of Saddam Hussein, including most democrats&nbsp; up until 2003, as doiung it for reasons other than national security, questioning their patriotism, is pretty disgusting.

				The report took this long not because it was politically expediant, but because of continued efforts by the republicans to stop the investigation. If the democrats did not get control in 2006 this report would never have even come to light. This is so much worse than anything Nixon did with Watergate, or Clinton lying about his affair with Monica Lewinsky, so why is nobody in congress talking impeachment?

				Yeah, I thought the timing of this release was politically motivated, but it&#039;s about time it was said. <br /><br />I also think that the Clinton sex scandal was politically motivated. The difference is that while Clinton getting intimate with an intern didn&#039;t really affect the country, the Bush administration&#039;s lies about the war did. Sadly, the Republicans spent more time and money persecuting Clinton than the Democrats spent trying to expose the administration&#039;s lies.

				Following my citation of the earlier Kucinich impeachment resolution, he has introduced a new resolution to impeach Bush yesterday afternoon where he states several ways in which Bush and the White House mislead the public and mishandled the war and the information about the war. Kucinich explains that Bush used a propaganda machine to construct the argument for the war. Kucinich then mentions other examples of Bush mishandling the war. http://rawstory.com/news/2008/Kucinich_presents_Bush_impeachment_articles_0609.html (http://rawstory.com/news/2008/Kucinich_presents_Bush_impeachment_articles_0609.html) The article has video of Kucinich and his impeachment resolution.&nbsp;

				IMO, I don&#039;t think the war was based on lies. I do, however, believe that the war was based on taking incomplete intelligence and running on speculation, which to me seems an extremely irresponsible way to plunge a nation into war.&nbsp; <br />NIE (National Intelligence Estimate) is an organization that draws it&#039;s speculation from various U.S. Intelligence agencies and basically makes an educated guess. To me, this does not seem like a good basis for launching the country into war.&nbsp; <br />The WMDs were not ever physically located, nor were they even proven to have existed.<br />The briefing by the NIE, if I read it correctly, stated that Iraq had the capability to obtain WMD materials, but there was no hard evidence of a nuclear weapons program in the works. I also can&#039;t really find where the hard links to Al Qaeda are in the reports. <br />I also believe that post-invasion reports almost all affirmed that there were not, in-fact, WMDs, hard links to Al Qaeda nor was there an imminent threat. To me, this proves why you get hard evidence before running into war, and not jump in based on speculation. The cost in American lives and tax dollars seems unreasonably highfor something that may or may not be true. <br /><br />This Senate analysis of pre-war intelligence is actually a pretty interesting read if you have the time: http://intelligence.senate.gov/phaseiiaccuracy.pdf
