OR- they&#039;ll realize it&#039;s a waste of&nbsp; time and close up forever. Like a few other places in the area

			Ended up going there last night for dinner. Had the classic cheeseburger, sans grilled onions and mayo mustard. Very tasty, not sure if it is worth the price. It was busy though. Fries were very good, hand cut. <br />They also have something called &#039;nitro shakes&#039; three flavors, vanilla bean, chocolate nutella and berry. Didn&#039;t get that.<br /><br />
