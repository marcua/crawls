				Hi guys,<br /><br />I’m a graphic designer in Astoria and I’ve been working on an annual print project for the last two years and cannot take it on this year for personal reasons. The job is paid, though the amount is TBD between you and the client. <strong>IF YOU ARE AT ALL INTERESTED IN THIS PROJECT, PLEASE CONTACT ME ASAP SO WE CAN ARRANGE A MEETING W/YOU AND THE CLIENT AND SECURE SOMEONE TO PRODUCE THIS BOOK ASAP. </strong> <br /><br /><strong>BACKGROUND</strong><br />The Astoria Center of Israel synagogue (www.astoriacenter.org (http://www.astoriacenter.org)) produces a booklet annually they call a journal. Each year they select a family/member of the shul to honor and then the book is comprised of congratulatory messages from friends and family plus more designed ads (w/logos, etc) from local businesses. It’s typically 80-100 pages in length (double-sided, so about 40-50 sheets of paper).<br /><br /><strong>DATES/DEADLINES</strong><br />The journal is our biggest fundraiser each year, so it’s vital that whoever commits to doing the book is able to follow through on producing it. Some front-end type introduction and general text will be ready by mid to late April (?), and many of the ads will likely be in by May 1 or so. The official end date for submitting ads is May 8th; you will get some stragglers afterwards. There is a party around on June 8th (?) where the book will be given out. The book can’t be late, as the party is already planned and advertised, etc. So it needs to be laid out, proofed by ACI staff, finalized by you, and printed (the printer will need at least 2 weeks) a few days before the party. So you’ll have about 2 weeks to do the book after May 8th, and I’d recommend you begin parts of it in the last half of April just so you aren’t too rushed (depending on your other projects). Last year it took me about 50 hours total to do the 100 page book, including a few meetings. The year before I spent about 90 hours doing a 150 page book (it’s doubtful this year’s book will be close to that large but we won’t know until more ads come in) but that year also took longer because I had to start the design and layout from scratch.<br /><br /><strong>GENERAL RESPONSIBILITIES</strong><br />I have all the Quark 6.1 for PC files, fonts, logos for many businesses, file w/all the master pages set up for various ad sizes, etc from last year’s book. You’ll need to know Quark well, be able to scan new logos and photos. Some of the front-end material (lists of board members, staff, etc) will be similar or the same and it will just need light editing. Some businesses may have an existing ad from last year, but you&#039;ll need to adjust the size ad bigger/smaller. Some new businesses will be on board and you&#039;ll do simple layout of their ads. It would also help me if you could coordinate getting the files to the printer and working w/them through the end, though I might be able to do that part if really needed (let’s work it out ahead, though). The client will give you photocopies of what people want in their ads, business cards w/logos, and you’ll likely do the initial text entry (not sure if this is negotiable w/the client, but it’s very light typing of small bursts) and layout and scanning. It’s important that you have good attention to detail, as there won’t be much time for proofing more than a round or two.<br /><br /><strong>IF YOU ARE INTERESTED</strong><br />I happened to volunteer on this project for the last two years because it’s my shul, but I unfortunately can’t this year so here’s your chance to make some good money and help out a worthy organization at the same time! Please contact me at: info@astoriacenterofisrael.org or 617-694-3612 (cell) or 718-777-0241 (eves) as soon as possible, even if you aren’t positive yet you want the project--we really need to hear back from people ASAP. Please confirm that you are able to proficiently use Quark 6 for PC, have time, are nice to work with, efficient, will keep commitment, etc. : ) Please send your rate if you feel comfortable. &nbsp;I can send you a PDF of last year’s book so you get a sense of what the job might entail this year. Anything to do with pay/deadlines/etc is to be worked out between you and the client, I am just trying to act as a go-between to make sure this gets off the ground. Please call me, not the shul, so everyone’s on the same page. Also, you need not live in Astoria to accept this job, but there will be a few meetings needed w/the client and Astoria will be most convenient for them for meeting.<br /><br />Thank you and looking forward to hearing from you! <br /><br />Teresa
