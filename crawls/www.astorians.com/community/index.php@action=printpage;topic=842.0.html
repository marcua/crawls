				@ semiastorian: I even like them as a company. Just be aware that if a series doesn't get enough traffic it could be discontinued. I am thinking of one of the various Sailor Moon series. I will stay with them even if other (unscrupulous) companies steal their idea and charge a lower price.<br />Their collection is so extensive that I even use them as a reference source in addition to http://www.imdb.com/<br /><br />@To all cable users and series addicts: Wouldn't it be nice to watch a whole series over the course of one weekend sans commercials rather than spanning over the course of a season or year? Please support this great company that actually <em>trusts</em> the customer.<br /><br />What shows do you like?<br />Presently, I'm really into the shows they have on [adultswim], now my all-time favorite television medium. I especially like &quot;Paranoia Agent&quot;.<br /><br />They have been showing Gungrave on G4TV, which is good if you can get it on demand. (There are <em>still</em> too many promos and they even chop off the ending song and credits.<br /><br />Here are some series that I've enjoyed in the past:<br /><br />Aeon Flux<br />Beserk (one of my all-time favs)<br />Cowboy Bebop (a true masterpiece)<br />Inu-Yasha (a classic even since it's original Manga form)<br />Kurouni Kenshin<br />Lain (alot of people just don't get this)<br />Nightwalker<br />Now and Then, Here and There<br />Reign: The Conqueror (originally 'Alexander', truly awesome)<br />Spawn<br />Super-Milk Chan (???????? !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)<br />Trigun (Another show which seeks Synthesis rather than Dualism)<br /><br />and <em>anything</em> to do with Tenchi.<br /><br />I've neglected Western Anime in this post except (Spawn) but that's a whole 'nother subject all-together.<br /><br />Milk-Chan be with you,<br />0zeno. :-)

				I am soooo glad that I started this topic.<br />And I am even <span class="bbc_u">more</span> glad that Semiastorian [Capital &quot;S&quot;] and Telesphoros [Capital T] responded!!!!!<br /><br />@semiastorian: There are only one or two films that you mentioned that I have seen, and I am <em>totally</em> ignorant of the graphic novels that you mentioned. Now, I will get out my Netflix list, finally watch those tiresome documentaries that have been lying around for the last two months so I can return them to their home and go totally Anime Apesh#t!! I will also break out my favorite map of Manhattan and track down each and every one of those comic books that you enumerated and soak in the creativity and subtleties in the subtexts that I believe can only be found in this rarified art form!!!<br /><br />You have saved me oodles of time with your list of faves, (I have suffered through a number a bad films (which I felt I had to watch in <em>both</em> translations) too horrible to mention.<br /><br /><br />People of the World! Put down your weapons and pick up your ink pens!<br />Read, Watch, and Create Anime... there is a Holistic Emergence that is waiting to happen, a Transcedental Synthesis, an end to hate and a beginning to Enlightenment which yearns to shine in the Hearts of every human being who has the patience to recieve this medium! Yea Anime!!!<br /><br />-Zeno.<br /><br />P.S.: I've been ruminating awhile about a project that is sorely in demand within the realm of Internet Radio (or...&quot;podcasts&quot; if you will). And that is a weekly? half hour to hour show devoted to this genre. I know that there will be a receptive audience if the content is good. Is anyone interested in hosting/writing/doing research for such a show? As creators of the show we would have to seek out and go to Manga conventions!!! each and every one that we can! We would have to watch even more <em>Anime</em>'!!!! We will have to seek forth and interview and possibly hang out and get drunk with the Artists!!! I guess that we would even be required to learn more about the actual Process so as to be able to ask the pertinent questions and not look like total noobys. How about it?<br /><br />I would like the show to be totally professional but at the same time totally non-commercial and licensed under the CC (that is freely distributable with rights attached). Iow, we won't be paid (in currency) but we may win the heartfelt goodwill (maybe even respect) of Hackers, Gamers, Geeks, Artists, Anime Fans and Creators everywhere, who will even (Hermes willing) want to be friends! This would be a dream come true for me personally (as I absolutely adore hackers, gamers, geeks, artists, anime fans and creators everywhere), monetary reward is not a consideration. We may even get a chance to vist some studios <em>in</em> Japan! Or even Williams Street Studios in Atlanta!!! Sound good? Let's Goooooo!!!!!<br /><br />-0-

				Zeno - before you rush out on an anime binge, I should warn you that most of the TV series I mentioned run to teenybopper cheese. I started watching anime as a preteen and never quite outgrew my tastes.<br /><br />However, the movies/miniseries I recommended are awesome for anyone, not just prepubescent girls.<br /><br />I esp. suggest you watch:<br /><br />Miyazaki's &quot;Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind&quot;, &quot;The Grave of the Fireflies&quot; (careful, it makes you cry) and &quot;Howl's Moving Castle&quot;<br /><br />&quot;The Cat Returns&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Please Save My Earth&quot; (sci-fi/fantasy)<br /><br />&quot;Video Girl Ai&quot; or &quot;DNA2&quot; (they seem dumb, but grow on you)<br /><br />and I'm sure I can think of more.<br /><br />As for the comics/graphic novels, I guess my tastes are more evolved because those are all good lit. Also, if you haven't read it yet, check out &quot;Maus&quot; by Art Spiegelman - it's a story about the holocaust, but using animals.<br /><br />What can I say, I'm a geek. This is what comes of having an older brother. :-)

				Just kidding :-)<br />Semiastorian, you are an Absolute Angel!<br /><br />Don't worry about it. I will watch everything that you listed... with gusto!!! Even though I'm a 34 year old decrepifying <em>white</em> guy, I still myself can't seem to get out of the pre-pubescent teeenage girl phase myself. Was that PC? In any case, I <em>adore</em> the Sailor Moon series and even as an adult try to find some hidden cryptic mystic astrological algorithmic occult meaning in each episode :-) I even made a Chart!!<br /><br />But &nbsp;the thing that made me <em>weep</em> however was your recommendation of Miyazaki's &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot;... a movie that ... just .. words... I can't do it justice...<br />It is my firm belief that if they were to show this movie during Social Studies class once a year to students, then people would be less inclined to put forth the &quot;Nuke'em&quot; solution, and be more reluctant to War in general. People must be made to see the <em>costs</em> of war, which is anything <em>but</em> a noble endeavor.<br /><br />I have a copy of Spiegelman's Maus and will re-read it at the first opportunity. Off topic: have you ever read Elie Wiesel's <span class="bbc_u">Night</span> and <span class="bbc_u">Dawn</span>? We should talk about this more under the Holocaust thread http://astorians.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=677 .<br /><br />So what do you think of the radio idea? There really is no pressure involved with this; it would be something that we could do for <em>fun</em>... in our spare time and no deadlines or time-limit either, or repsonsibilty...we can even do a show drunk off our as*es if you so desire... I <em>do</em> after all work for a living. Look at the rewards though, and the acclamation of our peers, nay History! &nbsp;:-) . I am serious, there <em>is</em> a vacuum in this department and expectant ears and eyes are waiting for it to be gesticulized :- :- :-)<br /><br />Well, let's post some more and investigate this topic more thoroughly while at the same time submitting it under the watchful eyes of fellow Astorians for inspection. Sooner or later we'll have enough material and knowledge to go out on the GIA &quot;Global Intarweb Airwaves.&quot; ink ;-)<br /><br />Please vide this neophytic topic: &quot;INTERNET RADIO or (podcasting) RSS feeds, etc.&quot; under the <strong>Technology: General Discussion thread</strong>: http://astorians.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=814&amp;start=0&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;highlight=<br />uhh. .. ..gotta change that Avatar..grrr.<br />I'm new to this myself, but I don't imagine it can be so hard to do.<br /><br />Your fellow Astoriyisis,<br />Zeno.

				Zeno -<br /><br />Well, if you like Sailor Moon, you would looooove Fushigi Yuugi (not sure how they translate it - Mysterious Game?). Same type of main character and romantic intrigue, but in a fantasy world. I loved the first half of the series - the second half got even too cheesy for me. <br /><br />(I find that even my love of cheesiness has limits, esp. when it comes to whiny drama queen characters. But that's just me.)<br /><br />As for the radio idea, I think it's great. Don't know what can come of it, but in theory, I'm game. <br /><br />A warning though, I'm a print girl, never done any kind of broadcast.

				Thanks for the suggestion. I will try and see them when I get the time.<br /><br />On the radio idea: I am also competely new to this kind of medium but can't imagine it to be that difficult. I have seen amateur shows come out that are absolutely terrible (sound quality, disorganization, lack of subject matter &amp; poor enunciation) but over time (after the creators stuck with it) improve and grow into absolute masterpieces, both interesting and entertaining, vibrant additions to the Internet community.<br /><br />As far as the benefits (besides being great fun) this kind of show would be filling a vacuum that sorely needs to be filled. Many times I have heard people verbally expressing such a belief. Plus it would provide us an outlet to talk about something which we enjoy and/or are passionate about.<br /><br />Let's keep adding to this topic (I'm a kind of writing type of person myself) so that we can pool our knowledge and opinions before we commit to the spoken word communication medium before the eyes of the world.<br /><br />&quot;See you soon!&quot;-Kagome<br /><br />-Zeno.

				Two questions:<br /><br />1) Has anyone who's seen &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; care to comment on it?<br /><br />2) Does it rate as &quot;teenybopper&quot; or something more like &quot;Akira&quot;?<br /><br />OK, I lied. Three questions:<br /><br />3) Where can I find DVDs to rent? Lackluster Video on 31st and Ditmars has part of the first season, except the first disk. Natch. :roll: And I don't know who rents stuff from there, but almost every DVD I've rented has had disgusting hand and fingerprints all over it. *blech* That unwashed stuff can screw up your DVD player too... <br /><br />I only know a few anime titles -- most of what I've seen is kind of disappointing, though. I absolutely love &quot;Akira&quot; -- hard to believe that it's nearly 20 years old! &quot;Cowboy Bebop: The Movie&quot; was a disappointment. Maybe it's because I never saw the series.<br /><br />And &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; left me going (?????) as does most anime. I think there's a disconnect in perspectives, a cultural gap, if you will that makes most of the stuff I see from Japan well, really odd and hard to follow.<br /><br />Oh, and if anyone has a DVD of &quot;Neo-Tokyo&quot; that they'd be willing to lend me, let me know. I'm very good about promptly returning borrowed videos, and taking as good care of them as if they were my own. (And I'm pretty dern anal about keeping my DVDs in good condition).

				Hi Daveed,<br /><br />I'm pressed for time right now but let me start to see if I can answer some of your questions.<br /><br />1) I wasn't a great fan of the Evangelion movies but I do think that the series was interesting and somewhat unique (for a robot theme). I don't much care for the robot sub-genre of Japanime'... but again, this series gave it a new spin.<br /><br />2) I woudn't rate it as teenybobber, considering some of the subject matter, themes of the nature along the lines of dehumanization, mechanization, spirituality,mass killing and violence. But I would also in no way equate it with the masterpiece (IMHO) of Akira. It's been awhile since I've seen it however. So the details are fuzzy if not totally inaccurate. ;-)<br /><br />3) I haven't rented DVD's or tapes in a long, long time... the reason being the lack of a selection. I stand by Netflix (pimp, pimp) for their Mission, Reliabilty, Originality, Cost, and most of all...their Selection. The people behind Netflix have been doing this kind of thing for a long time now, but it was only until recently did they become mainstream. I <em>detest</em> Blockbuster, and will not switch to them even if they paid me. :-)<br />They are the Microsoft of the video rental industry. :-O<br /><br />subsection $a) Cowboy Bebop the Movie could be considered IMO just a long (additional episode) to the series. <span class="bbc_u">I would not judge the series by the movie</span>. This goes even double for Inuyasha which on the big screen (for me) was a tremendous let down. You simply cannot encapsulate the multi-dimensionality of the characters and their long and complex histories spanning over 111 episodes in a feature length film. What you get is a watered down...nay &quot;dummed-down&quot; representational piece that was created even more expressly for mass and commercial appeal.<br /><br />If you haven't seen the series of Cowboy Bebop, I reccomend that you do. It is one of the most artistically poignant and subversive things that I have ever witnessed...not to mention very <em>very</em> funny. Plus the music is e-Fu*k-ing-Tastic. And, in contradistinction to Inuyasha, it is a complete series with a beginning, a middle and a Final Episode (which had me positively <em>Weeping</em>, especially if you have grown to love Vicious as well as Spike. The ending is not pleasant, but it is apropos (I just love it when artists go out of their way to disappoint their fans!.) :twisted:<br /><br />Many people have been puzzled by &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;, especially the movie. Again, I recommend the series first (which, like Bebop is also complete). Ghost in the Shell is a show about how humanity is co-opted by technology and vice versa as well as the philosophical implications of Artificial Intelligence and what exactly it means to be human. &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; is a favorite of many hackers and technophiles. The details that go into the drawings come very closely to becoming engineeringly plausible. Any engineers out there who disagree? Everything from the computer workstation, to the insectoid robots to the military devices have been worked out meticulously and with great artistry. If you don't at first get Ghost in the Shell then I recommend doing what I habitually do... and that is turn off the sound and just pay attention to the images, as the dialogue can be quite distracting. OTOH, the dialogue is what <em>makes</em> Ghost in the Shell, as this series explores in a sort of amoral way the machinery of power and what it takes to maintain control regardless of whether such a thing is inherently &quot;good&quot; or &quot;evil&quot;.<br /><br />There are cultural gaps between Japanese and Western society, but I feel that these are easily overcome as Japan is a modern industrial (as opposed to Agrarian) society. As I have watched more and more anime, these differences become inconsequential. We are approaching the very same problems but from a different point of view. OTOH I have found other societies (such as that in Southeast Asia) much more difficult to comprehend.<br /><br />I personally don't have a copy of Neo-Tokyo, and I only vaguely recall this feature but I am glad that you have respect for DVDs and by extension all media artifacts. If you want to borrow my copy of &quot;Ninja Scroll&quot; or the bootleg looking copy of some pornographic (hetero) anime then you are more than welcome.<br /><br />Keep watching anime! and if you <em>really</em> want to be puzzled watch a few episodes of Super-Milk Chan&quot;!!!<br /><br />May the Chan be with you, Muhahahahahahah!!!,<br />-zeno

				Title: <strong>On the Robot genre</strong><br />
				Post by: <strong>zeno</strong> on <strong>October 06, 2005, 12:00:05 PM</strong>
			</dt>
			<dd class="postbody">
				Anyone out there who knows better please correct me, for what I am about to say is probably going to be erroneous (yet again).<br /><br />The Robot genre are any of those movies where the main subject or device is that of a giant robot (if you want to see a <em>really</em> gigantic robot, watch <span class="bbc_u">Macross</span>), or that of a human being interfacing with the robot (controlling it). Sometimes there is in fact no human controlling it, but more on this later. There is usually a &quot;good&quot; robot (or group of robots) and a bad one (or set of bad ones) that eventually duke it out in a battle of epic proportions. The act of interfacing with the robot (usually being inside it) usually has profound psychological and sometimes physical implications for the operator, at times there is even a parasitic relationship where the human looses his or her individuality. In many of the movies and shows the origins of the robot(s) are unclear and sometimes came before &quot;time began&quot;, vide <span class="bbc_u">Big O</span>. The robots could either be distinct individuals in themselves or they could be modeled as a form of armour or a mix of the two, sometimes acting independently of the operator (maybe when the operator became unconscious or was working in contradiction to the prime directive of the robot) while most of the time not.<br /><br />It is my belief that the Robot Genre is the science fiction equivalent of the &nbsp;Samurai histories and legends of old. The Samurai dominated Japan for many centuries and the Japanese people seem to love relating their stories via many different media as entertainment. &nbsp;One of the things that gave them (the Samurai) even more power was their weapons and <em>armour</em>.<br /><br />There are even legends of &quot;haunted&quot; armour that were posessed by the spirit of a dead Samurai who became revenant in order to pursue some critical goal such as protecting his descendents or dealing retribution.<br />Since these manifestions were supernatural in nature it wasn't uncommon for the armour to change size, at times becoming gargantuan.<br />There are paralells in Western literature and legends, &quot;The Castle of Otranto&quot; being one such fine example : http://digital.library.upenn.edu/webbin/gutbook/lookup?num=696<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />@Daveed, Yes, I cannot recommend Cowboy Bebop enough. That movie has permanently changed my <em>soul</em>. I recommend that you rent (or buy) the whole series and watch it as if it were a long (very long) feature. I believe there are twenty-six (26) episodes. There are many storylines that thread through the series sometimes intersecting, sometimes diverging, and much of Spike's (as well as everone else's) storyline you only get in bits and pieces, a sort of puzzle if you will. But this is sort of like life, where we know people over time and yet the history of their lives are obscure to us. Only through what they say and their actions in the present can we know them.<br /><br />I haven't seen &quot;Howl's Moving Castle&quot; yet and I thank you for reminding me about it as it is quite well known and I feel as if I'm missing out here.<br />After I see it, I'll let you know, and then we can talk about it.<br /><br />See you soon :-),<br />-zeno<br /><br />btw be sure to check out &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; on [adult swim] It is produced by Seth Green (werewolf-boy from &quot;Buffy&quot; and 'Scott Evil' from Austin Powers, also the voice of 'Chris' on &quot;Family Guy&quot;

				Hey guys,<br /><br />Just wanted to poke my head in at the invitation of Zeno.<br /><br />I am currently a comic book writer and publisher based here in Astoria. My book, QUANTUM: Rock of Ages, is a twelve issue series chock full of sex, drugs, Rock &amp; Roll and time travel. We're just putting the finishing touches on issue #6 which should be out in a few weeks. You can check out what we're up to at this link:<br /><br />http://quantumcomic.net<br /><br />I wouldn't say I'm a huge anime or manga fan, but my artists is definitely influenced by it. My favorite anime would be Akira and Ghost in the Shell (I know, played out), and I was a pretty big Battle of the Planets fan when I was a kid. I think I've seen one or two Gatchaman episodes but it never really hit my fancy.<br /><br />Regardless, I do follow the medium as much as I can, and I have to admit I'd love to see my book as an animated feature film one day. So hopefully that will qualify me a little to interact here.<br /><br />Anyway, just a quick hello. Look forward to chatting with you guys soon.<br /><br />Philip

				I've been an anime fan ever since I was 12. First anime I remembered was watching Dominion Tank Police, Ranma, and Project A-ko from the actual Blockbuster anime collection...and BOY was it a collection. I remember all those times I finished a series and forgot to return them, while the late fees started to pile up like crazy...<br /><br />Now I download torrents, as a habit from my former anime club in college, as well as help people get, trade, and even find it whenever it is. Whether licensed or fansubbed, I make sure I can get it before anyone else comes by and rants on the server sharing it and forcing it to cancel just like the old AnimeSuki.org and Boxtorrents.org of legends (now animesuki.com and boxtorrents.com). Anything I don't find I try to find it in an anime convention outside the New York area because of the available pricing and continuous marketting of classical titles from the early 80's, 90's and beyond.<br /><br />My collection isn't the biggest but has EVOLVED into a wide collections from anime DVD's either bought or traded from Otakuden, Anime conventions, friends, heck even just for my own personal collection, to regular burnt CD's and DVD's out of my 4 year old computer. <br /><br />Due to my experience in New York as well as outside New York as not only a former co-vice President of the Anime Club in my High School as well as member in college, As a plus, I also worked with a computer technician/repairman in 2003 who introduced me to more ways to find anime not only in Torrent forms, but in order forms just in case people would want to find them in DVD format from regular companies. For helping I made my anime bigger and even saw anime I wouldn't find anywhere else.. Heck, I personally wouldn't mind joining up with other fans to share my anime as well as obtain others to expand and see what's out there. <br /><br />My information in finding new anime comes from either www.envirosphere.com as well as NewtypeUSA, the anime magazine, which I TRY to get every month. If not, then I search it up for the torrents ASAP before it goes out of availability. I'm a person that if you can't get one thing on eway, you can always get it any other way rather than one site or one situated method.<br /><br />Currently, I'm doing an OLD/NEW anime viewing in my own personal time. I just finished watching NADESICO as well as the movie, while I just opened up with Irrensponsible Captain Tylor, the new TV series of Ah! My Goddess!, then I'll finish up Melody of Oblivion, Burn Up Xcess, and finally get into Patlabor and Fist of the North Star, BOTH TV Series. Other than that I'll just look to see what's up ahead for me.<br /><br />My favorites? Honestly I treat anime equally since they're all works of their own art, just like art, life, and music itself. Sure some are considered more worked on in certain parts than others, but I watch it to see what's goin on regardless. Take for example, Here is Greenwood. Six Episodes of laughter that'll make people cringle over a drama for love in the end. You can't help a guy who's tryin to make it through college while finding love out of the outside with an old dorm so thin in its walls the next door neighbors always knocks at his door, askin just what's wrong with him...At least he's not Keitaro from Love Hina who's actually a Ronin in a Dorm with girls- and that's another story in its own..<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />SPIKE insights of Life being a dream since he quotes in the end that he's living in both the past and the present. Then he wants to know if he's really alive in the end as in the present and not living in the dream in the past with his love, stoically said to Faye in the last episode of the Series. There are always predicaments that people have to ask themselves which part of the past or present we're always living. Interestingly enough, Although he's been fighting in the present for answers, his past never left him due to him leaving &nbsp;the Syndicate past Vicious, while Vicious wants to overthrow it to claim it on his own. <br /><br />More of my insight when I get the chance to see the real folk blues pts. one and two again...

Remember, that Spike not only refers to life as being but a dream, but sometimes also a nightmare from which he desires to wake from.<br /><br />A little off-topic (but not really), something very specific happened to Spike which involved Julia and had the dramatic result of changing his world view as well as his general attitude towards life. We can speculate as to <em>why</em> he left the Syndicate and what forced him to not only ultimately return but become supreme Dragon in the process (though I sincerely doubt that he enjoyed the fruit of his labors).<br /><br />A couple of hints that support what I am thinking, although I'm not going to come right out now and say it, as this would deprive others of the almost visceral pleasure that I recieved when the answer finally clicked into place and I finally realized what Spike was all about (as when a puzzle is solved or a paradox is seen through or a zen koan...)<br /><br />Hint #1: is to be found in the lyrics and atmosphere of the song &quot;Rain&quot; ( I am still looking for the female version with Mai Yamane) which was played during the &quot;Ballad of Fallen Angels&quot; episode. In fact, it was while listening to this song that I understood what was going on...it sort of just creeped up on me and then one phrase &lt;BANG&gt; just spelled it out almost in spite of itself... FreaKing Eerie!<br /><br />Hint#2: has to do with (now I feel I'm giving it away too easily, so I'll be a little cryptic) astrology and earth religions. Keep in mind also Spike's attitude towards resistance and force as when he taught that petty thief in &quot;Waltz For Venus&quot; how to defend himself.<br /><br />Hint#3: &quot;Blue&quot;<br /><br />Happy hunting :-),<br />--Zeno<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 24px;" class="bbc_size">DRM</span> (Millenium_

				There were several things I managed to point out which I'll try to be as brief as possible.<br /><br />In occassion, I hope all of you who are reading this shall remember the certain subject which I will constantly be relating to. And that is:<br /><br />THE POWER OF THREE.<br /><br />First off in the Ballad of the Fallen Angels, If you listened closely there are three types of songs played. One was a Brahms/Schumann/Schubert type of song sang in tenor fashion, an &quot;Ave Maria&quot; type of genre showing the drama set for the first ever meeting with the trio and Vicious- AND the death of Mao. Second,was &quot;Walk in the Rain&quot; which shows the walking interlude from Spike to the abandoned Chapel where Vicious was keeping Faye captive. Third, was that creepy Frenchlike fugue while Spike was thrown from the chapel just to show the certain feeling of a slow gesture of flying in air, watching the blue blue skies and white clouds- My, the colors!<br /><br />It's also ironic just how Spike meets up with Vicious three times inside the actual series, not including the preludious flashback of when they were together, then Vicious going up against him for Syndicate power and rank.<br />Jupier Jazz had its moments when they met in an aerial battle while Vicious had to retreat after serious damage. How about The real Folk Blues? Funny how three songs manage to get into there as well. Ever remember Sartre's book, Nausea? Although the blues song isn't the same, it's the similar feel to get things better one way or another. PLUS, the second verse of The Real Folk Blues as its second song with Spike and the Red Dragon Syndicate showdown. Then the third and final actual song after Spike see the actual dark blue skies of space and time, &quot;Gotta be Free&quot; (not entirely sure if it's the name of the song, but it IS catchy..) showing the final ballad of time, space, and BANG from Spike.<br /><br />That certain technique of Water Spike demonstrates in &quot;Waltz for Venus&quot; very interesting as well, showing his his flow for water is as the same as the elements of the certain show of martial arts: Wind, Fire, Stone. How ironic he shows water since the form of it has no certain shape or size. It's just like space: if you see a star explode or throw a stone right in the water, its shape won't change but remain the same. The best could be said just like the Ego of Spike when he spoke to Anastasia in that store..<br /><br />:Anastasia:<br />&quot;DAMNIT! This one's for Mao, Spike!!&quot;<br /><br />Spike: I know..I'll drink this one for him..<br />:Drinks up till the brim:<br /><br />Ain't that what you don't do with alcohol? Drink it like water? So much for bringing the mood and spirits up one way or another, especially when your former friends passed away.

				@Daveed: Thanks for the Link. I had no idea that the term &quot;machinima&quot; existed. Unfortunately I won't be able to attend the show but it is heartening that art such as this is getting the attention that it deserves.<br /><br />@Aristotle: Thank you for the very informative analysis of Bebop. I honestly must say that I hadn't been paying attention to the synchronicity of threes that appeared. The name of the closing song btw... is &quot;Blue&quot;. Does this confirm a pattern?<br /><br />On the Spike riddle: I feel that you got real close when you mentioned that his water-like style portrayed a certain frame of mind... and yet I think that there is more to this... something very basic.<br /><br />P.S. Oh, I almost forgot, the final scene as well as the final song encapsulate the riddle. ;-)

				After seeing the water like substance imbued in the last several episodes overly reviewed by yours truly, it's been clear that Spike's a part of the elemental basis that's infinitely shifting from one place of the series to the next.<br /><br />Having to realize over and over again that it's a part of Spike's philosophy in terms of how reactive he is with his co-workers and how he &quot;seperates&quot;, or doesn't involve his past too fruitiously, his past haunts to his present work- or in this case tangles them one way or another that the both of them are seperated by the time The Real Folk Blues come to stage..<br /><br />You know what this reminds me of? This reminds me of two certain animes I've studied in the past- X:1999 Tv series and The Big-O, certainly because of the fact that many of the antagonists/protagonists of the series flow like water (Blue Water) to show emotion, philosophy, heck even standard behavior, then able to change in any given time.<br /><br />As of now I'm reviewing X1999 TV series in terms of the philosophy of the similar aspects involved in the anime already said. After that, it's on to Ah! Megami-Sama (Ah! My Goddess) Tv Series..Then Mobile Suit <br />Patlabor TV series!...Oyy, the schedule for watching anime...<br /><br />Oh and btw, Xeno..No hard feelings on telling you that I do security at a museum in the East Side.

				Good to see you again Aristotle. I got to start watching more anime myself and you seem to have selected some fine examples. A friend was telling me about something called Peerflix http://www.peerflix.com/ that I'm going to check out soon. You actually own the CD until you put it back up on the list. Netflix is great but I'm alway looking for other options. I'm also using Azureus http://sourceforge.net/projects/azureus/ alot per your suggestion. It's awesome and I'm sure to leave those torrents open after I'm done downloading :-).<br /><br />Sorry I haven't got around to the Thursday group, but I've been just too busy! btw: Why would I have hard feelings about you being a security guard for a museum? Do I really impress you as an Art thief? :-D I have to admit that I do play alot of ThiefII by TLG Studios... but that belongs under another topic!.<br /><br />Hope to see you soon,<br />--zeno

Which is why people such as myself are capable of intertwining with all the leechers, seeders, fansubbers out there and would like to both share/trade/increase my stock of anime for a long as I can live.<br /><br />As of most of the animes I collect are in DVD format and/or CD collective, There are several which I can&#39;t find in torrent fashion, which is why I only buy in a cheap place near my NYU campus as a customer discount. Not that I don&#39;t buy DVD&#39;s anyway but if and only if I see whether www.boxtorrents.com or any other torrent engine/server doesn&#39;t have the title, then I&#39;d chip in a few shells to purchase it. However, as my main authority stands, I&#39;ll always torrent things that are way to even things out.<br /><br />If anything, please contact me for more anime information. Otherwise when I get the chance after enrolling in the spring I&#39;ll be able to mark out my final updated list of anime.<br /><br />

				As agreed with Xeno, we will be plannin to host some anime to all you newcomers and veterans of the medium of anime. <br /><br />As of now we are discussing terms with the Waltz-NY crew to see if we can fit a schedule, should they agree on my itinerary of anime to be viewed. <br /><br />IF anyone has any suggestions for the anime to be displayed for the group to watch, feel free to drop it on the Anime Forums.<br /><br />Hopefully in two weeks time, I shall be showing an introduction to anime in Freeze Peach for everyone to come in and listen right after the brunch.<br /><br />See you all- and keep the anime spirit alive for all of us!<br /><br />-Aristotle

				I love most anime. Even though my husband is Japanese he hates it. It was my younger brother that first introduced me to anime. I don&#39;t care for what is known as Western anime however, ecept maybe the Simpsons. My favorites are things like Ranma, Inu Yahsa, Rurouni Kenshin. A lot of anime that I have is mostly downloaded though, through Azureus, Grouper or my brother.&nbsp; I do have a capture card on my comp and I do get Anime on Demand and Adult Swim on demand, and I might utilize them in the near future. It would be nice if we could get a viewing up some where even if it is only a laptop that we sit around and watch or meet at someone&#39;s house or something.<br /><br /><br />Complete Anime Series I have are......<br />Ranma<br />Bastard<br />Chobits<br />Elfen Lied<br />Slayers<br />Shamanic Princess<br />Gate Keepers<br />Earthian<br />Trinity Blood<br /><br />Current Animes I am trying to get more of<br />Ah My Goddess<br />Inu Yasha<br />Last Excile<br />Magiv Night Rayearth<br />Rurouni Kenshin<br />Final Fantasy<br />Mahou Sensei Negima<br />Spiral

We are presently negotiating with the owners of Waltz to get an Anime Night going where we&#39;ll be using a projector onto the big screen. The only condition is that there has to be people there to support it, so if you want to help spread anime culture spread the word and bring someone (especially if they haven&#39;t been exposed to this media!) :-) Aristotle is running this, so please communicate with him. He also has a pretty extensive collection that he wants to trade. We feel that if enough people show up then we will push for actual anime series marathons!<br /><br />May the Milk-Chan be with you!<br />__zen/-cf

				Thats great! As long as it isn&#39;t on another night that I already have commitments, then I will be there. <br /><br />Also for all those Inu Yasha fans. A test to see what Inu Yasha character you most closely resemble. I most resemble Inu Yasha.<br /><br />http://www.angelfire.com/anime3/lilsailorx/QuizInuyasha.htm<br /><br /><br />And here is a Ranma one but I am not going to say who I am most like because I don&#39;t like that one.  :-D<br /><br />http://www.selectsmart.com/FREE/select.php?client=ranmatest<br /><br />

				That&#39;s a pretty cool test KilDaraSidhe... unfortunately I got this response which really kind of surprised me as the questions that I answered didn&#39;t seem like him:<br />(http://www.angelfire.com/anime3/lilsailorx/QuizShesshoumaru.gif)<br />Who would of guessed? ;-)<br /><br />As far as Anime Night, what night do you think is a good night?

				Many apologies for not updating sooner.<br /><br />I just finished tackling a wild congestion and have to delay the lecture for anime on Freeze Peach to another week. Hopefully next Monday, I&#39;ll def make up the time and room after the Brunch to sit down and talk about the anime: its history, the authenticity of art, the situation b/t the companies and the laws of our land + some other miscelani...etc..<br /><br />I&#39;ve also negotiated with Waltz Astoria and they would primarily give us Tuesday Nights a free Two-Day-Per-Month type of scheduling as a start until we have permission from them to bring in more people for at least 2-3 hours where we will be tackling three specific titles, both new and old, and until I get the A-Ok from one of the owners, then we&#39;ll be able to start it right after next Monday&#39;s Lecture (Jan. 23rd)<br /><br />Other than please keep adding the suggestions. I would gladly try my best to inquire each and every one of them as soon as possible. The more people we can bring in the better.<br /><br /><strong>Note: as of the anime we host, we will do both Fansubbing and licensed/non-licensed anime granted that everyone agrees what we show. The purpose is to expand the visions and minds of both beginners and veterans that have seen this illustrious art for quite some time and we certainly don&#39;t want any uprising of &quot;political fervor&quot; -i.e why we can&#39;t put a title on due to its company bargaining or some reason of that nature. One of my friends have advised me to be utterly careful when showing this so that way no one would strike a fit if the anime seen in Waltz isn&#39;t appropriate. So, in this case I am letting everyone know that we will be combining both anime that has been popular and those that aren&#39;t, both new and classical titles, to give in more of a blend without making some trendstarting motif just for people to be judge, jury and executioner..RIAA 2003 vs KaZaa anyone?&nbsp; &nbsp;:| :?<br /><br /></strong><br /><br />Only time will tell if we can manage to pull this off one way or another. We do apologize for the delay and hopefully we can get things rolling on a good step. Hopefully if we can get either Thursdays for the future (or some other day rather than Tuesdays once we have a nice community), then it would be fantastic. Until then, baby steps to get something rolling.<br /><br />-Aristotle
