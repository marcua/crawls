				There is ICYP.&nbsp; They are done registering but you might still be able to get your son in.&nbsp; That is in the ditmars end of astoria.&nbsp; <br /><br />There is also baseball training called FAST.&nbsp; It is more skills-focused and not really a league.&nbsp; If you&#039;re interested you can PM me for more specific information. <br /><br />Our two boys have enjoyed both ICYP and FAST.

				WOW!&nbsp; I registered my two boys for the FAST baseball training program and they are playing like pro&#039;s. The trainers are all great and the organization is extremly organized.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />My sons play in the EDGE league which FAST works closely with. I&#039;ve meet a lot of parents that came to EDGE as a result of disorganized leagues in Queens. All the coaches are understanding to the childrens needs.&nbsp; My son&#039;s play in tournaments and we love every minute of it.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />We&#039;ve made many friends at both of these organizations FAST and EDGE. All of the parents we speak to say the same thing its like playing in a professional baseball atmosphere that is extremly relaxed, fun and compititive. GREAT COMMUNITY TO BE A PART OF.&nbsp; Thank you FAST and EDGE.
