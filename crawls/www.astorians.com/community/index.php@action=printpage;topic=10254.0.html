				Hello fellow astorians,<br />I am newly pregnant, like 4 weeks.&nbsp; I am trying to find a new doctor because my doctor&#039;s office is sort of cold and the people at the front are not that nice.&nbsp; Since I am going to be going there more often I would like a place that is perhaps a bit warmer.&nbsp; I prefer a female ob or midwife.<br />Anyone have any suggestions??!??&nbsp; I am willing to travel into the city.&nbsp; I would love someone who is holistic or an osteopath...but i am not shooting for the stars, i would take a good doctor with a friendly staff.<br />Thank you so much<br />tmt

				Dr Gila Aaron is awesome. I call her the Vagina Whisperer.<br /><br />I don&#039;t have her card on me (which is annoying b/c I thought it was in my wallet where i usually keep it and not finding it will suck when i have to make my appointment)<br /><br />She&#039;s in the columbus circle area. I think I know where it might be; if I find it I&#039;ll post it.<br />All my girlfriends I have recommended to her love her. <br />I haven&#039;t used her in terms of being pregnant (congrats!) but everytime I am there, she&#039;s got plenty of expecting mothers to see her (I&#039;m not waiting b/c she runs late...I&#039;m chronically early).

				Congratulations!<br /><br />If you&#039;re interested in a midwife, I can very strongly recommend CBS Midwifery.&nbsp; Their website is:<br />http://www.nycmidwives.com/<br /><br />They deliver babies at St. Luke&#039;s/Roosevelt and they delivered both of my little boys.&nbsp; I cannot say enough positive about my experience with them -- I wish all of my doctors were as responsive as the midwives were to my questions and my needs.&nbsp; <br /><br />Feel free to message back if you have any questions!

				I go to Dr. Michelle Francis, who is in the same practice as Dr. Aaron.&nbsp; &nbsp;In case Dr. Aaron isn&#039;t taking new patients or whatever, Dr. Francis is great!&nbsp; I&#039;m actually just in the process of starting to try to get pregnant, so I don&#039;t know what she&#039;s like as an OB, but I&#039;ve been going to her for several years, and a friend who had a baby about a year ago (before moving here) starting going to her and says she&#039;s great post-pregnancy as well.<br /><br />Their office is definitely convenient from Astoria, near Columbus Circle.<br /><br />Good luck with the pregnancy!

				I have one. Dr. Raufa Faroqui.&nbsp; Awesome. She takes all kinds of insurance and is located on 54th between Madison and Park. She delivered my daughter and cared for me all throughout my pregnancy in a professional and caring way. She has been a dr. for years and has no complaints/malpractice against her.&nbsp; The only con is her office staff is not what you&#039;d call warm and fuzzy but I didn&#039;t really care about that. If you want her contact info, it&#039;s on line or if you pm me, I&#039;ll send you her phone #.

				Hi there,<br /><br />you might want to take a look at these reviews on Dr. Gila and any other you are thinking of using -<br /><br />www.ratemds.com/doctor-ratings/26088/NY/New+York/Aaron<br /><br />I personally went to Dr. Gila a year ago and was not impressed that I had to wait for over an hour in the waiting room and then probably about 15 minutes in one of the examination rooms to get a 5 minute exam. First of all it was my first visit with her, so I was expecting to go over some stuff with her...I have never seen a dr go over history sheet so fast in my life!...she literally examed my breasts for a minute, took &quot;material&quot; for all the basic tests and that was it...I was actually totaly confused and surprised since I was expecting much more.<br /><br />I do not doubt her specialty and knowledge though, since I did read and heard a lot about her and she is a great doctor its just that in my opinion 5-10 min per a patient is not what I am expecting from my dr....so am thinking of changing her.<br /><br />Good luck and let me know if you find a good one&nbsp; :wink:<br /><br /><br /><br />

				This probably not convenient, especially not convenient to Astoria but I absolutely ADORE my ob/gyn, Dr. Christina Kong.&nbsp; &nbsp; http://www.downtownhospital.org/pages/3009/index.htm&nbsp; Actually, I love all of the ob/gyns I&#039;ve seen there, especially Dr. Raymond Wong.&nbsp; They are located at the NY Downtown Hospital which is a few blocks north of Fulton in the Financial Dist./Southern Chinatown.&nbsp; I go there because it&#039;s close to work, but if/when I get pregnant I&#039;m not sure what I&#039;m going to do.&nbsp;

				It sounds like you&#039;ve gotten great referrals, and you had said you were looking for a woman doctor, so I guess I&#039;ll just post on my OB/Gyn in case anyone else is looking, esp. anyone who has been told they are high risk.&nbsp; I&#039;m currently 14 weeks into my surpise 3rd pregnancy and I was no spring chicken when I had my first.&nbsp; I&#039;m actually more like a Christmas chicken at this point, and Dr. Silverstein has delivered all of my &quot;high risk&quot; (by insurance industry age standards) babies, first at NYU Midtown and I guess the next one will be at Mt. Sinai.&nbsp; They are a recognized high risk delivery practice, but they see everyone.&nbsp; Actually, they were the ones to calm my fears after reading all the baby books about how my risk for birth defects and other probs were scarey once I passed 40 (which I was for the last baby and this one).&nbsp; All of the OBs are men, but I would never call them cold--they are extremely warm and informal--Dr. Silverstein always greets me with a big hug and remembers all my family, even those he didn&#039;t deliver.&nbsp; There is one woman in the office, Dr. Gottlieb, but she focuses on Gyn only, no obstetrics, but she, too is very personable and warm. My first delivery was so much fun, the nurse told me I had to stop laughing and push!<br /><br />Dr. Silverstein started this practice with two other docs who were all teaching physicians at NYU.&nbsp; They have their own imaging office onsite, so you don&#039;t have to go from one hospital wing to another for your different appts. Mt. Sinai&#039;s birthing rooms aren&#039;t as pretty as NYU Midtown&#039;s, but I understand the rooms where you will be staying after delivery are more comfortable.<br /><br />I really love these guys and would recommend them to anyone.&nbsp; They take my insurance, which is Aetna:&nbsp; http://mfmnyc.com/index.html<br /><br />His contact info:<br /><br />Dr. Michael Silverstein<br />Maternal Fetal Medicine Associates<br />70 East 90th Street (co of Madison and 90th, quick trip from Astoria)<br />New York, NY, 10128<br /><br />(212) 722-7409

				Thank you all so much for this info.<br />I had a few negative experiences with doctors...I had been going to one female OB/GYN Dr. Shrivastava on the Upper West side (near work)&nbsp; she was very efficient, she was the one who taught me to count the days to see my most fertile and by golly it worked!&nbsp; (maybe i should have already know how to do this, but i did not)...her office staff was very cold though.&nbsp; i asked for a pamphlet upon their confirmation that i was pregnant and i was told they don&#039;t have any and i have to wait the 5 weeks to see the doctor to know what i am not supposed to be eating etc...then i got a few teeth smacks before i could make an appointment, like i was bothering her or something.&nbsp; the best was when i called to cancel an appointment she said, &quot;What, you not pregnant no more?&quot;&nbsp; i was so shocked that all i could do was studder that i am going to a different doctor.&nbsp; <br />I went to Dr. Aaron and she was very quick and seemed nice but she is 8 months pregnant.&nbsp; they told me on the phone that she would be away a week and june so i should not make my first appointment then, but come to find out, she is actually going to be on maternity leave...<br />then i asked her for a letter for a very stressful personal appointment that i had to put off for a month b/c i am not feeling that great and the stress.&nbsp; She told me that stress does not impact pregnancy or have anything to do with miscarrage.&nbsp; I told her that i have read a lot and it said I should try not to experience large amounts of stress.&nbsp; She then seemed very concerned about the fact that I am on cobra and will i be covered for the length of my pregnancy and how did i intend to pay etc...i was pretty turned off and very disappointed.&nbsp; She seemed pleasant during the office visit.&nbsp; Oh, and she also gave me a prescription that was someone elses so i couldn&#039;t get my pre-natal vitamins....an honest mistake, but after the other stuff, it just felt cold.&nbsp; she was gentle and quick and everything, but i think i may try a midwife, b/c i am looking for maybe some warmth or something....<br />it is so hard to find someone that you trust to deliver your baby...<br />I have an appointment in mid June with a midwife/obgyn office, Coralie Mcqueen and Sandra Woods.&nbsp; Wish me luck...who knew this would be so hard???&nbsp; I feel like I am a nice person, so there must be some karma or something that will bring me a nice midwife or ob!!!&nbsp; <br />I did see the other midwife center that someone mentioned here , it looked awesome, but they don&#039;t take insurance, and i am paying an arm and a leg for cobra i need to try to stick with my plan.<br />sorry this is so long...glad i got all this off my chest!&nbsp; Thank you to the person who did recommend Dr. Aaron, maybe she is just distracted right now b/c of her own pregnancy...i hope you are not offended by my opinion<br />thanks <br />tmt

				This information was actually provided by my Lamaze teacher -- who is a local mom as well as a doula (though not taking any new clients now b/c she is due in Sept).&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />If you are a high risk patient and really want a natural birth but must see a doctor I highly recommend Dr. Georges Sylvestre and his team (212) 746-1604. He is at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell. He really respects the birthing woman. ie he will wait till you want to push and doesn&#039;t force pushing or unnecessary interventions. This hospital is not known for natural birth but they do have showers and when there is a will there is a way. They also respect the doctor&#039;s order. Of course I highly recommend a doula for this hospital. Please feel free to email me if you have any more specific questions. <br /><br />For any of the following providers, particularly the midwives, the sooner you can call the better. Still, even if you are a late transfer, go ahead and make the calls as we have had many clients transfer late in their pregnancy. Also, some clients have found that if they keep calling a space may become available after all, so stay with it.<br /><br />Midwives at St. Lukes Roosevelt Birth Center:<br /><br />CBS Midwifery, Inc.<br />212-366-4699<br />www.nycmidwives.com<br /><br />Sandy Woods with Coralie Macqueen at Dr. Moritz 212-603-4160 <br /><br />Georgia Rose, CNM (office if Bronx)<br />(718) 543-9000 <br /><br />**Midwifery of Manhattan - Sylvie Blaustein, CNM, and practice<br />(212) 957-3006 www.midwiferyofmanhattan.com <br /><br />http://www.nywomenshealth.com/general-ob-gyn-midwives-st-lukes-hospital-new-york.htm<br /><br />_________________________________<br /><br />St. Vincent&#039;s, Hospital birth not a birth center limited showers no bathtub (must request shower)<br />Maureen Rayson&nbsp; - (646) 230-7708<br />http://mraysonmidwife... <br /><br />OBs at St. Lukes Roosevelt Birth Center: <br />When calling, you must mention that you are wish to deliver at the birth center to confirm if they are still delivering at the birth center and if they will take first time moms.

				If you go to St. Lukes Roosevelt&#039;s website, you can click on the left it says find a physician and then you can choose a midwife or ob/gyn.&nbsp; The doctor;s who are affiliated with St. Lukes mostly deliver at the birthing center there...you may want to just ask when you call to make an appointment to double check...but if they are affiliated with that hospital and you want the birthing center, you should be able to get it!!&nbsp; good luck.&nbsp; what is your due date??&nbsp; Congrats!&nbsp;

				I have never seen Dr. Gila Aaron, but I used to go to the same office for another Dr. and had to switch because of the same issues you had. The women at the front desk were rude and each time I went there, rather than looking in my chart to see why I was there, since I wasn&#039;t showing yet, they all assumed I was there for my yearly! Plus, the Dr. I saw, whose name I won&#039;t mention, told me I could take ANY over the counter drug even though I was pregnant as long as I took it &quot;in moderation&quot;, but didn&#039;t say what &quot;moderation&quot; meant. Again, this wasn&#039;t Dr. Gila Aaron, I never saw her, but it was the same office. <br /><br />I switched to Dr. Lily Wong, she is on the Upper East Side, and she is amazing! I love the staff, they are so nice, and remember not only my name but things about me each time I am there and ask about me. My first appt. she gave me a list of things to expect at each visit, things I could and couldn&#039;t take in terms of medicine, food, etc. Each time I have emailed with a question, she gets back to me within 24-48 hours. Dr. Wong isn&#039;t holistic, but is very open minded and she is just plain wonderful! here is her website:http://www.cityobgyn.com/About.html&nbsp; She delivers at St. Luke&#039;s Roosevelt, and I believe in the Birthing Center as well.<br /><br />she even helped me find the names of pediatricians in the Astoria area through other patients! I am due in four weeks and have had a great 8 months with Lily!

				THank you for the validation.&nbsp; I was beginning to wonder if i am going crazy with all of these bad experiences with doctors.&nbsp; The over the counter medication thing is really dangerous, i am glad that you changed doctors!&nbsp; I have my first appointment on June 11th with two midwives and a ob/gyn office.&nbsp; I have my fingers crossed.&nbsp; I will keep the doctor you recomended in mind as well, if this one doesn&#039;t work out....i really hope it does though!<br />Good luck to you!&nbsp; You are almost there!!!!!!&nbsp;

				yeah--the minute she told me that I could take any OTC, I knew I needed a new DR. Thankfully, I have 2 cousins who are nurses, one in an OB/GYN office, and a sister who has had 2 kids and I knew from her experiences that OTC meds were limited. <br /><br />Good luck with your appts! If they don&#039;t work out, definitely check out Lily--she and her staff are all amazing wonderful, warm and friendly (and patient, I have a million questions and concerns everytime I am there) people!<br /><br />

				My OB/GYN is Dr. Brown and I just love her. She&#039;s affiliated with St. Luke&#039;s, but I don&#039;t know what her office&#039;s and other Dr&#039;s in the group philosophy is for the Birthing Center, or having midwives or doulas around. Not being pregnant, I haven&#039;t asked these kinds of questions.

				aha! No wonder her name sounded familiar to me. Gotchya&#039;. Yeh, I don&#039;t understand this whole philosophy of not being guaranteed a doctor for your delivery. Another preggie friend was relating stories of genetics testing to me and we were both musing how ridiculous that is. I guess unless you&#039;re making a decent wage and can afford a private doctor or are in suburbia, it can&#039;t be guaranteed? Bizarre!

				Aha, *that&#039;s* why her name sounded so familiar! I saw Dr. Aaron a couple of years ago, and also got the &quot;you-should-start-thinking-about-getting-pregnant-ASAP&quot; treatment......despite being single. She could&#039;ve been worse, can&#039;t say she was bad but it was a long haul to the west side.<br /><br />Any female doctor who takes Vytra within a few miles of Astoria would suit me fine at this point! As long as they&#039;re reasonably friendly.

				All,<br /><br />Thanks for validating my experience with Dr. Aaron&#039;s office.&nbsp; When you can actually get her attention she&#039;s OK but the staff is horrible there (constantly not forwarding messages and screwing up my birth control pill scrips with my HMO).&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, she IS very &quot;pro-baby&quot; and not terribly supportive if you want to NOT have kids ever.&nbsp; Trying to talk her into doing a tubal ligation for me. Also, I&#039;ve had some serious symptoms currently and in the past, and I really don&#039;t feel that she&#039;s taking them seriously. Also, she keeps trying to push an IUD on me instead of a tubal, which is STUIPID and DANGEROUS if you&#039;re not in a committed, monogamous relationship.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to call around to some of the good docs mentioned here.&nbsp; I still need to resolve my immediate acute gyn issues with her but then I&#039;m outta there.

				Hello<br />I had started this thread when I first found out that I was pregnant and have since found a practice that I like, so I figured I would spread the word!<br />I am going to a practice with two midwives and a doctor.&nbsp; Dr. Moritz is the doctor and Sandra Woods and Coralie McQueen are the midwifes.&nbsp; I am primarily going to Sandy and Corey.&nbsp; They are both very gentle and kind and take time to answer all of my questions.&nbsp; The deliver at St. Luke&#039;s Roosevelt Hospital either at the birthing center in the hospital or at labor and delivery.<br />Their office is located at W57th st. between 8th and 9th ave.&nbsp; Not far from the N or W trains.&nbsp; <br />Good luck to all of you!<br />I am due Dec. 24th, so I will keep you posted on how they are during a delivery!!!!

				I just moved to NYC from the west coast and found out I am pregnant a couple of weeks ago. I have a few location questions. Is it realistic to plan on delivering in Manhattan? It seems like it could be a pain in traffic. I don&#039;t really know though. Second, I was reading the website for St. Luke&#039;s-Roosevelt and it said you had to pay extra for a private room so your husband could stay with you in the room, is that common for NY? that would never happen on the west coast.&nbsp; &nbsp; Any other suggestions that people have on great practices that use both Ob&#039;s and midwives.

I believe she said that the ride over was the worst part of her entire labor.&nbsp; <br /><br />You&#039;re going to pay for a private room anywhere in the city.&nbsp; On the other hand...&nbsp; they&#039;re not necessarily going to throw your husband out of a non-private room at 11 pm - but they&#039;re not going to tell you that. <br /><br />I spent 6!!??? nights at the hospital when I was delivering.&nbsp; The first two were in labor and delivery.&nbsp; Private room.&nbsp; but no 2nd bed.&nbsp; My husband could have slept in the recliner that first night... but we knew he&#039;d be more comfortable and get better sleep at home in bed.&nbsp; And because I needed him to be 100% with me the next day - we decided for him to spend that first night at home.&nbsp; I hadn&#039;t gone in to active labor yet.&nbsp; They didn&#039;t start inducing me until 10pm.&nbsp; <br /><br />The next 4 nights I was in a double - and I just lucked out and didn&#039;t get a roommate until the last night.&nbsp; Again - there was no bed for my husband to sleep in (they don&#039;t let you touch the 2nd bed in the double) and we agreed that getting real sleep was more important than being there overnight.&nbsp; He would stay late - and get there first thing in the am... but he went home to get about 5 - 7 hours a night.&nbsp; He did taxi back and forth - so the commute didn&#039;t take him too long.&nbsp; And NY Pres is a little closer than St. Lukes.&nbsp; <br /><br />The last night - my roommate&#039;s husband was there pretty late.&nbsp; It would have been fine with me had he stayed the night - but he didn&#039;t.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think it&#039;s all just luck.&nbsp; If you get a roommate - hopefully she&#039;ll be low key and not care if there&#039;s a man in the room.&nbsp; Sell her this way - it&#039;s another person there to help soothe the crying baby. <br /><br />having the dad sleep in the hospital sounds really important and all - but when you&#039;re there - you may just realize that he&#039;ll get much better sleep at home - and you&#039;re really going to need him to be wide awake.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />aside: my sister in law, her husband and the new baby walked into their house after arriving home from the hospital - they were all exhausted.&nbsp; a few minutes later the husband tells her - &quot;oh Honey - I just took a couple of sleeping pills - I REALLY NEED SOME SLEEP.&quot;&nbsp; She didn&#039;t kill him.&nbsp; She&#039;s a better woman than I.&nbsp; <br /><br />Good luck

				hello all congratulations on your pregnancies and births!<br />I have signed up to deliver at St. Lukes Roosevelt on 10th ave btwn 58th and 59th street....hope to make it to the hospital on time =)<br />they have a birthing center where your husband can stay over with you in the room.&nbsp; but you only stay one night there and then have an early discharge and a visiting nurse comes to the house.&nbsp; it is a bit more hippie, but i am going to give it a try.&nbsp; the only thing is it is for natural births and there are some limitations....i.e. you can&#039;t be more than a few days overdue, they cant&#039; think the baby will be more than 10 lbs., things like that, I guess higher risk factors are not permitted.&nbsp; So I am not sure if this will happen for me, but I do like the idea of my husband staying also.&nbsp; Oh, and if you choose to stay longer in the hospital than one night (which I have a feeling i might do) and you don&#039;t want the early discharge then you can be moved to labor and delivery...then you either stay alone in a double room or pay for your husband to stay in a single.<br />hope that helps.&nbsp; there is a class that you take at the hospital in order to give birth at the birthing center.&nbsp; if you have any questions just let me know and i will let you know what i know!!

				Hello Violet<br />Everything went very very well.&nbsp; I had sandy deliver me.&nbsp; She stayed with me the whole time and was very supportive.&nbsp; I started in the birthing center, but then went up to labor and delivery b/c i was not dilating enough.&nbsp; she came and still delivered me in labor and delivery.&nbsp; she advocated for me when needed as well.&nbsp; the nurses in the birthing center were terrific as well.&nbsp; I had Kat (or Catharine0 during the first half of my labor and then sue.&nbsp; both the midwife and nurse came up to labor and delivery with me.&nbsp; <br />And i had a healthy baby boy, 8lbs, 6oz.&nbsp; <br />If you have any other questions or need any support please feel free to contact me!<br />I also had a lactation consultant come to the house my third day home and found it very helpful (pricey, but helpful)!<br />good luck to you!!! hope you are feeling well.&nbsp; By the end of my pregnancy i was ready to have the baby :0)<br />Tina
