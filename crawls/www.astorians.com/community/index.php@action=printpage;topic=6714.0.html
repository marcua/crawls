				I got it as a gift, along with some kind of brain game. It&#039;s interesting for when I am totally bored out of my mind. I took it on an airplane last summer, and the man sitting next to me played with it while I slept! He thanked me, and said I saved him some money because he no longer felt the need to buy one for himself. Generally it sits in a drawer.

				I don&#039;t personally own one, but I&#039;ve borrowed someone else&#039;s and it&#039;s great for traveling. Makes train/plane/bus rides seem very short. Definitely worth getting if you&#039;re into video games and do a lot of traveling. I see people playing them on the subway too.

				A lot of my students have one and last Friday we went on our trip to upstate.&nbsp; These came in very handy.&nbsp; I enjoyed using it as we all competed against each other in a game of Mario-Kart.&nbsp; I am considering purchasing one now myself.&nbsp; It comes with a PictoChat in which you can talk to other people with DS that are near.&nbsp; The convenient thing was that we all didn&#039;t have to have the game itself.&nbsp; One person hosted the game while everyone else searched for us and downloaded the software from the Host DS.&nbsp; Anyways, it made the 3.5 hour bus ride seem like an hour or so.

				I accompanied a friend to an appointment yesterday where we basically sat around for four hours and his DS came in mighty handy during that time. Plus, I&#039;ve always been a fan of Nintendo over other game systems so I may be a bit biased, but I think it&#039;s much better than the PSP.

				DS &gt; PSP&nbsp; :mrgreen: <br /><br />the DS is worth it 100%, especially if you commute and travel - and games are inexpensive and fun<br /><br />i also have the psp - but i use it for storing pics, movies, games, music and internet web browser - also i can use it as a remote for a ps3

				I think I&#039;m going to get one this Friday.&nbsp; I hope they have it at the Best Buy on 86th.<br /><br />Can anyone recommend any games?&nbsp; I&#039;d like something with a lot of replay value.&nbsp; I wish they had Guitar Hero...

				If you like old side-scrolling Mario games you can&#039;t go wrong with &quot;New Super Mario Brothers&quot;.&nbsp; &quot;Yoshi&#039;s Island 2&quot; was really fun as well.&nbsp; &quot;Tetris&quot; has a handful of new different play modes, and you can play other DS users even if they don&#039;t have the game as well.&nbsp; Your DS just sends a small download to theirs and you can play against them in one of three battle modes.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Mario Kart is a definite.&nbsp; Whether I buy it with the system or not, I don&#039;t know.<br /><br />I&#039;m thinking about Castlevania.&nbsp; I&#039;ve always liked those.&nbsp;

				I LOVE Advance Wars: Dual Strike. It&#039;s one of those strategy games where you get the battle maps and have to move the individual pieces around and they have different abilities. Not sure about the replay value, but it takes many hours just to beat the game through once - some levels took around an hour to beat - plus there are multiplayer options and things where you can build your own map, though I never bothered to do that.
