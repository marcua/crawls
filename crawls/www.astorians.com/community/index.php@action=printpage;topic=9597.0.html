				I don&#039;t see any posts for Rapture lounge on 35th Street and 28th avenue.&nbsp; This place is really GOOD!&nbsp; The staff is great, they have nice activities from time to time.&nbsp; &nbsp;They have happy hour everyday from 5-8 - buy one get one free.&nbsp; The food is also quite good.<br /><br />This is my first post.&nbsp; I have been trolling around this site for the last few weeks now.&nbsp; Decided that today is the day I take the plunge and actually post something!!&nbsp; I have lived in Astoria pretty much all my life.<br /><br />

				Welcome to the board! I don&#039;t think Rapture has it&#039;s own thread, but it has been mentioned in many and is a favorite on the board.

				I&#039;ve had two birthday parties there.&nbsp; The people are nice and the set up is comfy.&nbsp; The specialty drinks are a little pricey, but not moreso than other &quot;lounges&quot;.

				I&#039;m new to the board too.... Someone said it &quot;rocks&quot; but does it really <em>rock</em>?<br /><br />I know what you meant but I&#039;m looking for a place with some good Rock and Roll, isn&#039;t divey... Something along the lines of Sparrow or its predecessor... I forgot the name of the place but it was on 34th Avenue and I think 35th Street. Something like that.<br /><br />Any word?

				Alas for whatever reasons Sparrow ne√© Tupelo seem to be the only folks into, well, not looking for a lengthy music chat, but &quot;rock&quot; that&#039;s not typical internet jukebox classic rock. Yes, I suppose leaning towards hipster tastes (meaning not on classic rock radio I guess).<br /><br />I&#039;m still baffled daily (well when I think about it) that there aren&#039;t more spots like this around.&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty certain the clientele exists by now in Astoria... too bad I don&#039;t know a thing about running a place (or have the cash :-() I can guarantee a small group of regulars for anyone considering it!
