				I just passed a sign on Ditmars around 35th Street, that said an Asian Bistro was coming soon.&nbsp; Let&#039;s all hope it&#039;s not yet another sushi joint on Ditmars!!&nbsp; Wouldn&#039;t it be nice to get good Chinese restaurant that isn&#039;t horrible take-out?&nbsp; Or perhaps Asian Fusion?&nbsp; I think Thai&#039;s getting a little old around here too, so they will have to stand out.

				Yes - it&#039;s in the spot where the tux shop was.&nbsp; I&#039;d bet they will have sushi, but they seem to be installing equipment for more than that - at least one of their permits specifies installation for a wok.

				Ugh...Please no more sushi at Ditmars!<br /><br />They should have clauses in their leases like shopping centers do sometimes (ie:&nbsp; no Chinese restaurant can operate within x amount of distance from this address where another Chinese restaurant is open).<br /><br />I was so excited when Go Wasabi opened, then Watawa but now there are just too many!&nbsp; It&#039;s sort of like when Emac, the Italian Ice place (by 21st Ave and 31st Street) and ColdStone all opened relatively close to one another.<br /><br />Edit:&nbsp; I should clarify that I&#039;m a big fan of sushi and often confused by having too many options.&nbsp; I&#039;d rather see more of a variety of restaurants open in the area.&nbsp; P.S. Thanks to whomever gave me the neg nod.&nbsp; *grin*

				Actually both places closed because of the Blackout of &#039;06. According to Emack and Bolio&#039;s main branch in Boston, they were going to re-open, but due to unforeseen circumstances ( they didn&#039;t specify what those were) they weren&#039;t able to re-open, as we all know so well. And who is the Italian ice guy that you keep referring to? Emack was there at least a year before Cold Stone opened.

				There was an Italian Ice place really close to where Bonus Stage and Mimi&#039;s Closet are located.&nbsp; It was there for two summers.&nbsp; Just a guy and about 20 or so different flavours of Italian Ice.&nbsp; Sadly, the business didn&#039;t do well so it folded shortly before the blackout.<br /><br />I do miss Emack&#039;s though.&nbsp; Even the one on 7th Ave and 14th Street closed.

				I remember that place, I think I was there twice in total. Too bad in any event.
