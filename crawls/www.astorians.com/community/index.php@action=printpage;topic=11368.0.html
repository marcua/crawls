				Hello moms and dads.&nbsp; I am having a major dilema.&nbsp; My hubby and I are still trying to figure out whether or not we should inlist our son into the local public school (ps 84) or a private school for pre k.&nbsp; We have been going through the pros and cons but we are still torn.&nbsp; I would love any feed back from my fellow Astorian moms and dads.&nbsp; Thanks everyone.

				My daughter is only three months, but I have consulted in many schools. <br /><br />I&#039;m usually not for private school. One, i have observed in many many public schools and I am usually impressed at the younger grades. SEcondly, private school teachers make a lot less money than public school teachers (for the most part...maybe not in the upper east side). So, I have often wondered who are the teachers that are accepting of these lower paid positions?<br /><br />I&#039;m also not as impressed with the early curriculum used in private schools.

				My son went to a local Montessori school for pre-K and Kindergarten. I am thrilled with his reading ability and was very comfortable leaving him there for full day classes. I can&#039;t speak of PS 84 but I would recommend the Montessori method of teaching pre-K age students.

				Can&#039;t speak about ps84, other than what is on the &quot;inside schools.org&quot; site-- which makes it sound like a pretty good school in general.&nbsp; I think that some new reports have also made it onto the board of ed site recently, if you haven&#039;t checked in the past month or so.<br /><br />We also have a 4 yr old and are figuring out what we&#039;re going to do for prek and beyond.<br /><br />I teach for the board of ed (but in the special ed district), but have also taught at private schools.&nbsp; Really, I think that it depends on the school (the school culture, the principal, discipline, how much time is used &quot;for the tests&quot; and how much time is spent on arts, etc) and the teacher that your child gets (which sure can vary!).&nbsp; <br /><br />It is really hard to wrap my head around, too.&nbsp; I&#039;m not in these schools-- though I&#039;ve spoken to a few teachers who teach in Astoria.&nbsp; It sounds like in general that the schools are very good and the teachers sound pretty happy.&nbsp; And happy teachers mean that they feel like they are accomplishing goals, getting students to learn and progress....<br /><br />Also, not all schools are going to be a good fit for your child or for your family.&nbsp; I think that my oldest child has done pretty well at his daycare/preschool so far.&nbsp; When a new concept is introduced, he picks up on it pretty quickly and enjoys the learning process.&nbsp; I think that he would do well at a traditional school.&nbsp; Public schools in Astoria are fairly traditional type of schools from what I have heard.<br /><br />Not that there&#039;s anything wrong with that.......<br /><br />I really like public school, though I understand the appeal of private schools, too.&nbsp; There are some really fantastic ones in the city....<br /><br />Good luck in your search!

				My 2 children both did montessori from age 1 until time for kindergarten. After that to go from $850 a month to free...I don&#039;t have to explain. I am pro public school because they are offered a lot of programs and are more diversified. Every public school is different but if the school is doing well grade wise, it seems to reap the benefits of what if offers - extra supplies, computers, programs, etc. From my experience with a friend of mine - her private school child who is the same age as my public school child seems to be more sheltered and naive to just about everything (from recycling to 9/11). But with all of that said.....if my child didn&#039;t get to go to a great public school (122), and we were zoned for a school that was a mess, I would do private. So if your zoned school is Grade A, i say go for it (you are paying taxes for it!)<br /><br />BG30

				Does anybody know anything about 166? All I keep hearing is that its overcrowded and you are out of luck if your kid needs any kind of special attention. I&#039;ve also been told that ESL kids make up a large percentage of the classes and it holds back a lot of the kids who know English fluently from reaching their full potential. I enrolled my son in private pre-K but wondering about next year. Really can&#039;t afford private, but if the public is as bad as everyone makes it out to be, I guess I have no choice. Nobody in my neighborhood is sending their child to public. I&#039;m worried.

One of my best friends (who frankly, is incredibly smart and amazing with children - she comes from a big family and has worked with kids since before I met her in high school), got her masters, with honors, has glowing recommendations, etc etc etc, and still couldn&#039;t find a job in the public schools. I even hired her part-time back at my old job back home (not with kids), and while hiring or living with friends is usually a mistake, I can objectively say that she&#039;s a great employee. She is currently a first grade teacher in a Catholic school for half of what she should be making (imho, and compared to other first grade teachers), but it&#039;s better than nothing, right? She has been in her position for 4-5 years, and she&#039;s constantly looking, but really - it&#039;s THAT hard to get in.<br /><br />Please don&#039;t judge a school by how much it can pay its staff. Visit the school, talk to other parents, read up on the place, etc. That&#039;s how you should make your decision.

				You make a good point and you should get to know the school first, but in my experience as a teacher for 12 years and now a professor of teachers, it isn&#039;t as hard as all that to get a public school position...some positions are more difficult to get than others...and if the public schools are more competitive and taking teachers that make the cut, it makes sense to me that I would want my child to go to the public school system.<br /><br />Howver, when you are talking about the younger grades, preschool and pre-k, the caliber of private school teachers is questionable and certification as a teacher is not always present, which is a huge problem.

I&#039;m zoned for 171, so I did make a choice of going to Catholic School this year (not me personally) and try to test my son into 122&#039;s gifted and talented program for second grade.

				I was a public school kid- But i am a private school mommy<br />I have had this debate with my sister over and over and over again..And i refuse to budge<br />Do i think my child is getting a better education? I don&#039;t know that for sure-he is a straight A student!<br />All i can say is.. That i am greek, my husband is catholic. Currently my son is in the 4th grade enrolled in Immaculate Conception. I am a full time mommy-full time worker-and for reason i cant figure out yet- i am a full time PTA parent.. Cause my 15 month old doesnt keep me busy enough..lol<br /><br />I will say that my son is happy. He loves his school, and his friends, I love that school. The classrooms are not over crowded, and the teacher along with the principal know you and a first/last name basis. My child also learns religion (dont know how much longer he will be interested in that subject) and for $3500 a year.. Heck.. its worth it!!!! <br /><br />I guess all my blabbling, still didnt answer the question..<br />But i will say- due to the comment made about salaries.. you have to really think..those private school teachers must really love what they do because the salary does stink! :x<br />

				My son started at a Montessori at 2 yeras old and then at 4.5 we moved in to parochial school for PREK.&nbsp; We knew we would do parochial for his elementary education, so it was a no brainer to start him there for full-day preK -- as opposed to crossing our fingers and hoping to get him into a puclic full-day slot , only to transfer him for K.&nbsp; PS 122 is a good school, if we were zoned for that we might have considered it (or at least I would have, my husband really prefers parochial)&nbsp; We are at Immac on Ditmars and 29th and I am really, genuinely happy with the school.&nbsp; Very family-like, culturally diverse, affordable (obviously not free like public, but the rate is def FAIR and affordable) and the teachers we have met so far have been fabulous.&nbsp; I absolutely reccomend it to anyoen looking for an elementary school or early childhood program.<br /><br />Joyce

				Sorry I can&#039;t help you on the Private vs Public School dilemma but we are zoned for PS 84 and am wondering what you have heard or know about the school that gives you reservation?&nbsp; It seems to have ok scores and writeup on insideschools.org.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know anyone who has sent their kids to PS 84 so any info would be helpful.<br />

				Since my kids are half Greek we are now considering St. Catherine for elementary education. Does anyone know anything about the school? The most I have gotten from other people is that the education is good, but there is a sense of elitism. Our other choices would be PS 166 which hasn&#039;t gotten good grades or ratings and gets badmouthed by all the neighborhood moms or charter school if my child is lucky enough to get in.

				We were debating on whether to put our child in 166 or in private school.&nbsp; We decided to try it.&nbsp; &nbsp;Administratively, they can do much better and the PTA needs to improve.&nbsp; There doesn&#039;t seem to be much parent involvement in the PTA given that the school has over 1,100 students, but hopefully this will change.&nbsp; Our child is in the dual language program and the education she gets seems pretty good.&nbsp; I feel there&#039;s a lot of homework for a kindergartner, but not unmanageable.&nbsp; New grades came out for the school this year and, if I&quot;m not mistaken, it acheived an &quot;A&quot;&nbsp; -- a far improvement from the &quot;D&quot; of last year.&nbsp; It&#039;s worth it to take the orientation.&nbsp; You&#039;ll have to ask all the questions, because a poor job is done of giving you all the information you need.
