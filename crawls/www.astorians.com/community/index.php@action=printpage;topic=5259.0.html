				Yay!! I used to go to Pub Quiz back in the day with my friends, I&#039;m SUPER excited for it here in Astoria - although...March 24th isn&#039;t a Sunday. The website says March 4th - could it be happening sooner than we thought? This is me excited: :lol: !!!!!<br /><br />(If it is March 4, I&#039;ll miss the first one, I&#039;ll be out of town. But I&#039;m still super excited! See all the exclamation points!)<br /><br />!!!

				I&#039;m gonna be soooo not on a team since I can&#039;t come on 3/4. Is anyone going on the 11th that want to make a team with me? I would tell you all of the other teams I&#039;ve been on, but they were all associated with my last job, so there&#039;s that whole inside joke thing which no one but me will get and it is lame. Maybe we can call ourselves &quot;TEAM AWESOME&quot;. Because we will RULE. SOMEONE. COME JOIN TEAM AWESOME WITH ME.&nbsp; :mrgreen: :lol: 8-)

				Usually, teams are formed there at the bar.&nbsp; You choose a name, depending on who is there and what people like.&nbsp; Silly names are good, and can be especially funny after a few drinks.&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; I think once I was on a team called &quot;The Avatars&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp; :D<br /><br />For me, too much planning lessens the fun.

				Some quick notes.<br /><br />Wow, the bar was HOPPING last night.<br />The Quizmasters do a pretty great job and drink and smoke their fair share.<br /><br />The Rover has a great friendly jukebox.<br />Love it when &#039;Du Hast&#039; or the Police are on.<br /><br />and the Unicorn.<br /><br />(Mama Mia ... not so much, but enjoy.)<br /><br />I miss seeing the baby crawling around. (Lots o health and blessings)<br />&quot;You have a baby? in a bar??&quot;&nbsp; Of course.<br /><br />While I dont think of Rover as a Sports Bar, it can be a fantastic place to catch games and Yankees.

				Looking forward to being there this evening (11th)!<br />I&#039;ll be looking for a team to join, and I suppose my best areas of knowledge are music and world affairs (I mean, if there&#039;s going to be any sort of bidding war for my team membership... like shahhh...)<br />Hopeless on US sport (I&#039;m British for goodness sake) and even worse on the Wisdom of Presidents... but that&#039;s another matter altogether.<br />See you guys later.

				You all will be very proud to know that I went to a pub quiz night while in ARUBA last week! And it was awesome. They normally only do the quiz in Dutch at the place we went to, but they were super awesome and did it in Dutch and English for their new American friends. Also, digital pictures were taken by the quiz tallyer girl, and we noticed that pictures from the previous week were in the local paper down there, so I&#039;m gonna comb that paper&#039;s website next week to see if we made it.<br /><br />We did horribly (there was only me and my friend on the team, most other teams had 5 people), but we had a lot of fun&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />Oh, also, we somehow got NY Channel 7 while there, so we were watching NYC news, and we named our team in honor of your wind chill that day - 10 Below. Don&#039;t hate us.

				McGlouglin&#039;s (spelling?) on Broadway between 31st and 32nd had their pub quiz last night.&nbsp; Lot of fun, though they added a couple of rules.<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Only two people per team,<br />2.&nbsp; One hundred questions,<br />3.&nbsp; These questions were at times crazy!&nbsp; One of them was, what is the ball at the top of the flagpole called?&nbsp; &nbsp;The winner got 65 out of 100 correct.<br /><br />Only bad thing was that it was a bit disorganized.
