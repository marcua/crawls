				Thanks, BKozis, definitely will check &#039;em out! I&#039;m always looking for great deals, prices these days just seem to be going up on everything! I don&#039;t toss those weekly fliers from the local drug stores (CVS, Rite Aid) and supermarkets until my bf and I have studied them! Always find something we need on sale in &#039;em!

				I have used FatWallet.com to find some great deals. Another tip is <span class="bbc_u">never </span>buy something online (travel, Amazon, Target, etc.) without a coupon code which is entered at check out. Usually you can Google &quot;Amazon Coupon&quot; or &quot;Target promotion&quot; or something like that and you will get a ton of links to promotions. I recently used a coupon code to book a hotel down in New Orleans. With the coupon and my AAA discount, I knocked off about 20%. A little homework can save you a bundle.<br /><br />

				http://printable-coupons.blogspot.com/ (http://printable-coupons.blogspot.com/)<br /><br />The thread about rite aid made me remember I had been meaning to link you lot to this site. It&#039;s really great. Every time I go shopping, I check this site before I go. It&#039;s a big help. And I&#039;ll 3rd Fatwallet - but I mainly use it for free samples - you do get a lot of junk from fatwallet, though. I wound up with a (free) subscription to VIBE magazine (I&#039;m white. It was weird.)I got them to cancel it after 3 issues but - just a warning you <strong>will</strong> get spam as a result of free samples on fatwallet.

				Before I do any sort of online shopping, I check up on the site on http://www.retailmenot.com and 95% of the time they&#039;ll have some sort of percentage-off, or free shipping, or free stuff code... or all of the above!

				Just read an ad in USA Today for a free coupon for oscar meyer hot dogs. go to oscarmayer.com befor 11:59PM tonight. (sorry just read it now, know not much time) They ask for your email address and then your mailing address to mail the coupon in 4-6 weeks. Took me just a minute. Take Care.

				Hey jbh,<br /><br />That&#039;s pretty great to have a list of coupons that match up with sales, but last time I tried using coupons printed from the internet at the Key Food on 31st @ Ditmars, they wouldn&#039;t take them.&nbsp; Has that changed or do you go to a different Key Food?

				I recently picked up couponing for whatever I can save on. I found the CVS has the most valuable sales by using coupons and their in store sales every week. I would like to start a thread about how I and others save money by shopping at CVS. <br />In the past two weeks, I&#039;ve used $42.43 in cash (including tax) to get $186.82 worth of stuff from CVS. CVS is well known for it&#039;s overprice items but even cut the total price in half, I still did pretty well in saving. <br />I used to only print out coupons online but now I also buy one or two newspapers on Sunday and occasionally buy coupons from some website to save more. <br /><br />Here&#039;s the few sites that I use to print online coupons or get ideas of what upcoming sales/coupons in Sunday papers would be:<br /><br />www.simplycvsshopping.com<br />www.couponmom.com<br />www.coupons.com<br />www.smartsource.com<br />www.redplum.com<br />www.neutrogena.com<br />www.loreal.com<br /><br />I would love to have weekly transactions post up here to help whoever needs to save a few bucks. I also would like to know how other people save on groceries and other items. Time is tough and we need to spend less to get more&nbsp; :wink: .<br />
