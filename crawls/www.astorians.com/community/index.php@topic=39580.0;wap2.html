The people elected the electoral college. The electors are in most states technically speaking not bound to their votes. So you&#039;re wrong.<br /><br /><br />--- Quote from: Eamonn on November 11, 2016, 08:32:58 AM ---I know you just can&#039;t stand that your 8 years of endless government programs and illegal voting is over but you will just have to deal with it.

The president went and made a point to vilify both Mexicans and Muslims and there are plenty here in Astoria. I think it&#039;s absolutely an issue that will become relevant in a practical sense moving forward under his presidency.<br /><br /><br />--- Quote from: Eamonn on November 11, 2016, 08:32:58 AM --- so take your BS political views to a like minded socialist flag burning protest and get them OUT OF ASTORIANS.COM!<br /><br /><br />Mic drop<br /><br />--- End quote ---<br /><br />You probably would have done better if you had simply posted that you think it&#039;s irrelevant to this site, rather than post the above vitriol. You&#039;re not being very convincing I think.

			I like how you dissect my response instead of acknowledging this type of discourse has no place on this board. But most of your opinions are equally off point.

			Chill out dude. This is the people&#039;s site - not yours. You don&#039;t make the rules or tell people what they can post about.&nbsp; Treat others with respect - you&#039;re violating the terms of the website - re-read the agreement you signed when getting your account. <br /><br /><br />--- Quote from: Eamonn on November 11, 2016, 08:32:58 AM ---Hate to break it to you snowflake but he won the election.
