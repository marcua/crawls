				I&#039;d love to hear from parents who send their kids to local Parochial rather than public schools.&nbsp; I am a product of public schools and a teacher in a great NYC public school.&nbsp; I have no personal experience with any parochial schools.&nbsp; But when I was growing up - the parochial schools were not known for strong academics.&nbsp; They were known for good discipline (bad kids could be thrown out) and some decent sports teams.&nbsp; <br /><br />Astoria has some very good public school.&nbsp; I believe we could have more if more of the parents who get involved at school were to place their kids in the public ones rather than private.&nbsp; <br /><br />what&#039;s the appeal? <br />

				&nbsp; Bad kids thrown out in parochial schools.... what do they do with them in public schools ?<br />&nbsp; My experience with Catholic schools has been positive. <br />&nbsp; Lots of individual attention, extra help for kids with learning problems, focus on religious ed. of course, small classes, progressive discipline, lots of parent involvement, afterschool programs, clubs, sports, school nurse.<br />&nbsp;Most children accepted to high school with scholarship $. Majority from Catholic HS, accepted to college with scholarship $.<br />&nbsp; There was a lack of music and art and phys ed. , but I&#039;m not sure if that is any better in the public school system.<br />&nbsp; Of course, the cost is something you cannot overlook. The Catholic schools have a scholarship program for children in need. When you belong to the parish, there is a reduction in cost as you will be supporting not just the school , but the church.

				Both of my children go to Catholic school.&nbsp; I am very happy with the education my children are getting.&nbsp; I personally did not want my children in my zoned school simply because of the over crowding issue.&nbsp; I felt as if they would get lost in the shuffle of kids. In the school that they go to, they are known by name by the principal &amp; it is not because they are bad kids!&nbsp; She knows every child.&nbsp; They get individual attention &amp; small class sizes.&nbsp; My daughter is in K &amp; has a teacher &amp; an aide in the class.&nbsp; My son needed some extra help in math so he goes to a tutor for help in school.&nbsp; The school they attend has higher tests scores than the public schools.&nbsp; They both attend gym, music &amp; computer classes weekly.&nbsp; They have an outdoor recess if it is nice out. Also, as kathyjean mentioned, most kids get scholarship $ for high school.&nbsp; Again, this has been my experience with catholic school.&nbsp; We are very involved in the school.<br /><br />

				Here is a different perspective -- that of the student, specifically a non-Catholic sent to private (not parochial) Catholic school starting in 7th grade.&nbsp; As I am also now a parent, it is a relevant issue to me as well.<br /><br />Why do parents send their kids specifically to parochial schools? I would imagine that some like the fact that parochial schools are Catholic - and some like what they perceive as a more &quot;old-fashioned&quot; way of education than the NYC public schools and don&#039;t care about the religion aspect.&nbsp; Since a parochial school is affiliated with a specific church (I think), parents who attend that church may want their children to go there - they may think there is more accountability since they are members of the affiliated church.&nbsp; Parochial schools tend to be less expensive than private Catholic schools.&nbsp; There may be a minority who don&#039;t like the religion aspect but consider it a valid trade-off for what they think is a better education.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know.&nbsp; Unless the religion matters to the parent, I don&#039;t see the appeal myself, and I also always had a similar impression that they weren&#039;t stellar academically.<br /><br />As a non-Catholic, my own personal experience of Catholic private school was horrendously miserable.&nbsp; I think if you are not Catholic you are at a distinct disadvantage if you are sent to a Catholic school, whether it is private or parochial.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t &quot;discrimination&quot; or bias against me in any way relating to the schooling - it was a good school academically and I did well.&nbsp; It was things like - being required to take the religion classes, and being made to go to Mass - and even confession, which completely flummoxed me as a concept.&nbsp; I was expected to know religious concepts I had never even heard of, and they didn&#039;t particularly care if it put me at a disadvantage.&nbsp; It&#039;s also a little disconcerting to be taught that you are (probably) going to Hell, even if you don&#039;t believe it.&nbsp; Some of the nuns, especially the ones who taught religion, clearly had a disdain for me.&nbsp; I was never outright teased or taunted about not being Catholic by the other students, but it was definitely an underlying issue and I felt singled out and uncomfortable a lot of the time.&nbsp;

				&nbsp; When you send your child to a Catholic school, it is a given that they will be taught the tenets of the Catholic faith. This includes the sacraments, which includes confession. Confession, communion and mass are requirements of the religion.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I have no direct experience with Hebrew schools for those of the Jewish faith, but I understand that the tenets of the Jewish faith are also taught at those schools.<br />&nbsp; When I was in 7th grade at Catholic school, all the children were Catholic. However, when going to Catholic HS,&nbsp; more of my classmates were non-Catholic.<br />&nbsp;When you enroll your child in a Catholic school&nbsp; or Hebrew school, you get the teachings and traditions of that faith.<br />&nbsp;Private schools, that are not faith based are another option. For example, The Garden School in Jackson Heights.

				I second Danigirl. I think our kids may go to the same Catholic school. &nbsp;My daughter is in kindergarten and there are 22 children in the class. &nbsp;She goes to the afterschool, which is great because I don&#039;t know how many, or if any, of the public schools have afterschool. &nbsp;I am zoned for P.S. 17 and after careful research felt that Catholic school was the way to go. &nbsp;It was a good decision since she absolutely loves the school as do I. &nbsp;She is reading at about a 2nd grade level and is turning out to be very proficient on the computer. &nbsp;I am certainly not against public schools per se...having attended public school myself. &nbsp;Had we been zoned for the school across from P.S. 17 I&#039;d probably have sent her there.

				For us, it was a number of things:<br /><br />(1) IMMAC offers an afterschool program and early drop-off<br />(2) IMMAC has great test scores<br />(3) IMMAC offers a real &quot;family&quot; feel.&nbsp; I know most of the parents in my daughter&#039;s class.&nbsp; I have a good relationship with the teachers/principal and feel that they really care about the children and are responsive to any questions or concerns that I&#039;ve had.<br /><br />Frankly - the public school system is confusing to me and researching all the various options is quite daunting, especially to a working parent who can&#039;t spare time during the week to visit them all.&nbsp; I know and trust IMMAC, so I send my daughter there.

				Kind of a loaded question, don&#039;t you think? <br /><br />But seriously, the schools in Astoria are, for the most part, very good.&nbsp; It&#039;s easy to find out which ones are good on Insideschools.org and greatschools.org, and on the NYC Department of Education website.&nbsp; Personally I don&#039;t know why you&#039;d forego a really good and free public school for a parochial school, and with few exception there&#039;s no evidence that parochial schools are, individually or on the whole, better academically.&nbsp; I do agree that the parochial schools have some serious advantages for working parents who can&#039;t pick up their kids right after school.&nbsp; Some public schools have afterschool programs, but not all, and programs that are available aren&#039;t necessarily available for every grade. <br /><br />I think one component of this issue is the question of what schools are supposed to do.&nbsp; In my view, along with the three R&#039;s, kids need to learn citizenship and socialization.&nbsp; What better place to do that than in a public school, where people come from varied social, economic, and ethnic backgrounds? I moved to NYC because I wanted to be in a place that has everyone and everything.&nbsp; I love looking at the diversity in my sons&#039; classrooms, and I just don&#039;t think you get that in parochial schools because the student body tends to be from a much narrower swath of the general public. <br /><br />This is all aside from the issue of whether parent want their kids to get religious education -- that seems to me to be a personal preference issue.<br />

				&nbsp;Many different social strata are represented in the Catholic schools that I have knowledge of. Children from economically disadvantaged families are eligible for scholarships. Not all the children are from middle class families. Most are not from wealthy families.<br />&nbsp;Citizenship is encouraged in these Catholic schools as well.Can someone with classroom teaching experience in public schools speak about citizenship education ?<br />&nbsp;One significant difference that I know about is the salary disparity between public and Catholic schools. Teachers in Catholic schools make less $$$$ than public school teachers. Sad , but true. Many teachers leave the Catholic school system after a few years of low salary.<br />&nbsp;Most Catholic schools are associated with a Catholic church. Therefore much financial support comes from the parish church.

				I wanted to start this conversation for not so purely selfish reasons (but somewhat selfish)<br /><br />As a strong believer in public schools I want to send my son to one. (I also don&#039;t see a private option in the vicinity that I could afford or that interests me).&nbsp; I think the best way to make sure that the local public schools are great is to make sure that local active parents are very&nbsp; involved in their community&#039;s school.&nbsp; It bothers me to see (read) about active parents who have their kids in private schools (schools where my child and many other local children wouldn&#039;t be welcome - although they might be allowed to attend) because these are community activists who could be helping to build great schools for all children (okay - maybe very selfish).<br /><br />Through reading your responses I certainly understand your choices.&nbsp; Especially thoughts that the public system can be daunting and the Catholic schools are &quot;known&quot; vs public &quot;unknown&quot; entity.&nbsp; <br /><br />To respond to a couple of questions people asked.&nbsp; <br />What happens when a student misbehaves in the public schools:&nbsp; it depends on the infraction.&nbsp; But no student is thrown out without a hearing.&nbsp; Even once a student IS thrown out of public school - he/she is taken in by another public school.&nbsp; (unless the infraction is extremely severe).&nbsp; I believe the tolerance of misbehavior is MUCH higher at the public schools (because it has to be - students are guaranteed their right to an education). <br /><br />As far as civics .... I don&#039;t remember the exact question.&nbsp; All students at my school (and I think all NYC public schools) are required to complete a certain number of community service hours each year.&nbsp; The older the student, the higher the commitment.&nbsp; Also the mayor&#039;s office has started an outreach program this year to help make sure that all schools complete at least one community service project each year.&nbsp; So far this year our schools has held 3 different Special Olympics sports events, a Special Olympics Halloween party, worked in a soup kitchen, held a food drive (City Harvest), a book drive (Project Cicero) and a $$$ collection for Clinton&#039;s Haiti Relief Fund.&nbsp; &nbsp;(These are just the events I know about - not every event/drive is well publicized). <br /><br />10 active families with the ability to fund raise $2000 each = an after school program for a public school.&nbsp; &nbsp;10 families putting their kids into the local public school rather than the private one could make a world of difference for 150 families.&nbsp; <br />

				Why would your child and many other local children not be welcome in some local private school ? I don&#039;t get it.<br />The city actually had to PAY $$$$$ to parents/guardians of public school students to get them involved in their child&#039;s school.<br />Why are the parents not active in the public school system ?<br />Private school students do participate in community service activities.... the question is /was , what civics classes are held in the public school system?<br />&nbsp;Private school systems that I am familiar with do not throw students out when a student misbehaves.... Not sure where you are getting your info from. In a public school if the student is thrown out, he just goes to another school, well that can happen in a private school as well.<br />&nbsp;Do the public school parents raise $$$$ for the public school ? Do the public schools have after school programs ?

I also never have heard about fundraising for a public school that benefited that particular school.&nbsp; <br /><br />Why do you feel that your child would not be welcome in a private school?&nbsp; There are children in my sons class that are not catholic and they are not treated any different from the children who are catholic.&nbsp;

				Why would you send your child to a religious school when you are not of that faith?<br />You get what you pay for.... if you want to send your child to religious school, affiliated with a church, for a reduced tuition, you have to join the parish. Your choice, not theirs.

But after that&nbsp; what schools are good &gt;? or great as some keep saying &gt;?&nbsp; &nbsp;I pass by L.I.C , on my way to Costco and it looks like&nbsp; a prison on yardbreak when the kids are coming out . Like 15 police vans , some cops even had riot gear on . I know 2 girls that go to that school and one of their classmates is like 20 yrs old cuz he got left back at least 4 times .

				I want to clarify a few things to avoid any misunderstandings. The reason tution is cheaper for parish members is that they are required to donate the difference to the church during Sunday collection. It is only a break in that church donations are tax deductible while sending your child to parochial school is not. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">in the same vein - I wouldn&#039;t want to send my child to a school where he was taught that evolution is just a theory and sex education is nonexistent. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Jennifer I can assure you that evolutionary Biology is taught in NYC Catholic School, and is not in the least against the teachings of the church.<br />As for sex ed, when I was going through Catholic school, (these many years ago) sex ed was indeed part of the curriculum. It was, if I recall correctly, age appropriate. My son is seven going on eight. If anyone suggests that kids at that age need sex education, (other than quit touching yourself) I would hope they find a job that doesn&#039;t involve children.<br /><br /><br />If I weren&#039;t Catholic I would agree that it would be difficult to help the kids with homework or studying. It would be very difficult to say to a child that you disagree with something, but that you have to write it down to get a good score on your test.

				Jennifer, which schools in Astoria are good schools? My son is too young to go to school, so he may be going to a parochial/private nursery. However, I would love to have him in a public school by the time he is 6 or 7. I am the kind of parent who will be involved. However, it is so hard to say which schools are good. I keep hearing that Astoria is now known for good schools. I keep hearing that only PS 122 is a good one, but I also hear it is huge, overcrowded, and that does not appeal to me ... If you work in the public school system, please share your impressions about good schools in Astoria. What are the options?

People seem to be pleased with Our World Neighborhood Charter (the elementary.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t heard anything good about the middle school.&nbsp; The bad I heard was from a friend who subbed their once and wouldn&#039;t return).&nbsp; I talked to a mom the other day who has a senior at LIC H.S. The mom and the son LOVE it.&nbsp; He had been in a small private school for 9th and 10th - but it couldn&#039;t accommodate his desire for foreign language.&nbsp; He&#039;s learning Latin, Spanish and French in school and teaching himself Cantonese.&nbsp; Because LIC is so large they are able to offer a wide selection of classes including many AP.&nbsp; <br />People seem to like PS 122 but I&#039;ve also heard there&#039;s homework (lots of it) in KINDERGARTEN!!! And a push for the little ones to drill drill drill for tests so they score well.&nbsp; <br />But again - these are just one (or two) people&#039;s opinions.&nbsp; It&#039;s why I would like to get a conversation started.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				p.s. 122 is not the only good school - my son went there and yes it was good but now he goes to I.S. 10 which turned out to be good as well. The principal is VERY strict, they offer nice programs and his teachers are wonderful. They know him for him. I think in public school you get exposed to so much more as far as different cultures, religions, etc. which I think is important. But honestly - none of the schools in the neighborhood are really BAD are they? Do you ever see them in the news about gang related violence or shootings or being closed down because they are doing so poorly? yes, some schools may have higher exam rates then other, etc. but I think what matters most is the child and the parents. My son is doing well in school partly because I am on top of him with his school work and stay involved, and partly because he is a pretty good student. If you have a parent who doesn&#039;t care or a child who doesn&#039;t care or both, the child probably won&#039;t do as good in school regardless of where they go.

				Jennifer,<br />thank-you for starting a great discussion.&nbsp; I also share your frustration with parents sending their children to a parochial school.&nbsp; I really can see why people do send their children to parochial schools but I&#039;ve looked around and I am not convinced all parochial schools are better than some of the better public schools.&nbsp; <br />To answer the questions about what schools are great, I must say a lot of schools in Astoria are very good.&nbsp; Please review Insideschools.org and the board of ed website for details about schools in District 30.&nbsp; Some of the better schools in Astoria are 122, 85, 2.&nbsp; I think some other schools do not have the reputation of being fantastic schools but if you visit you&#039;ll find community schools that are working very hard to make a difference.&nbsp; &nbsp;Do not go by test scores alone.&nbsp; Try to talk to the parent teacher coordinator.&nbsp; Talk to parents who have their kids there.&nbsp; Ask questions and you&#039;ll learn a lot about your community school.&nbsp; I think the other thing to note is that what is good for your child and family may not necessarily be good for someone else&#039;s child.&nbsp; So it&#039;s a little unfair that judgement be passed around.&nbsp; It is is highly personal decision and a hard one.&nbsp; <br />Having said that I really wish more parents would send their children to their zoned schools.&nbsp; My zoned school, for example, is a school that is trying really hard to be great school.&nbsp; The administration is open and warm.&nbsp; They listen to parents and want involvement at all levels.&nbsp; Many families with higher resources in my neighborhood opt to send their children to parochial schools or send them to other schools in District 30 (it is possible to do with some work).&nbsp; So I made the unfortunate decision to not send my child to our zone school because I did not feel like there were enough families with whom I could roll up my sleeves and work with to make it a fantastic school.<br />We are still trying to decide where to send our child.&nbsp; We are deciding between two public schools and a parochial school.&nbsp; It is a very hard decision and I have spent countless hours researching the options.&nbsp; I am sure many parents do the same and we hope that all end with the best choice for their child.&nbsp;

				mamidesamuel - thanks for sharing your experience. <br /><br />I would be very interested in what you find out through your visits and the experience you have in going through this process.&nbsp; There is only so much information that can be found on the websites.&nbsp; Of course everyone&#039;s experience is different and very personal - but I think that the more that is shared (esp. the positive) the more likely people are to feel comfortable with the public options.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />
