				I&#039;ve met both Carolyn Maloney and Reshma Saujani. Both women are smart, creative individuals and I support primaries on principle--especially when the general election is essentially uncontested. But I&#039;m a strong Maloney supporter. Reshma Saujani hasn&#039;t given a single instance where she would&#039;ve voted differently than the Congresswoman. Why give up somebody with a strong leadership position in the House (the Congresswoman is Chair of the Joint Economic Committee) for an untried, untested novice who can&#039;t even point out why she&#039;s a better choice? Her campaign has also been relentlessly negative and more than a little fact-challenged. And finally, Saujani&#039;s resume is devoid of any public service--instead she&#039;s spent her time bouncing from one predatory banking firm to another.<br /><br />Maloney, in contrast, has given us a long list of legislative achievements. Not least of which is her consumer protection bill that restricts predatory abuses by credit card companies.<br /><br />The Village Voice has an article that thoroughly trashes Saujani with her own career and record. I&#039;d feel bad about it, except Saujani has spent so much of the campaign attacking Congresswoman Maloney that she deserves a taste of her own medicine. And at least the article is being honest, which is more than I can say about Saujani&#039;s negative mailers. Here it is: http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/archives/2010/08/reshma_saujanis.php

				Maloney is okay, but I&#039;m still holding a grudge when she sided with the big insurance companies and spoke out vehemently against any public option for the health care reform. Reshma seems to be more of small business advocate, but that may just be her campaign platform to get votes.

				I agree it is good that Democrats would have a choice. However, Maloney and Reshma should both honor attending debates for voters.<br /><br />There seems to be little argument why an incumbent should be turned out by a Democrat. Only makes sense if there were a suspicion of corruption and not much reports of such in this district. And if the House will have a GOP speaker, Maloney is a stronger contrasting voice.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=19187.msg202148.html#msg202148">Quote from: mjmurphy on August 26, 2010, 03:59:25 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I&#039;ve met both Carolyn Maloney and Reshma Saujani.

				Clearview, lumping public option advocates together with terrorists is absolutely disgusting and thoroughly beyond the pale. Your words damn themselves with their histrionic and offensive overreach. Moreover, your point is nonsense on its face--public spending is all that kept this economy afloat as consumer demand evaporated. Your regressive idiocy would drag us back to the age of robber barons and debtors prisons. You have the audacity to slap the weary epithet &quot;un-American&quot; on those of us who want to secure the foundation of our economy by protecting the middle class while you advocate policies that would dismantle the very civil society that makes us great.<br /><br />I will thank the voters for sending Carolyn Maloney back for another term to combat exactly this sort of nonsense. Despite AlexNYC&#039;s recollection, Maloney actually &nbsp;supported a public option &nbsp;(http://maloney.house.gov/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1893&amp;Itemid=61) and only conceded that fight to win the larger battle of meaningful healthcare reform.

				Apparently there&#039;s a Republican in this race, Dino LaVerghetta (http://www.dinoforcongress.com/).&nbsp; Check out this press release:<br /><br />New York, New York- Today, Dino LaVerghetta, the Republican-endorsed candidate for Congress in New York&#039;s 14th Congressional District, condemned Carolyn Maloney for her ties to the Socialist Party.&nbsp; Last week, the Democratic Socialists of America (&quot;DSA&quot;) revealed that seventy U.S. Congress Members belong to their caucus.&nbsp; The DSA proclaims to be the largest Socialist organization in the United States.&nbsp; According to their website, DSA members openly &quot;reject an international economic order sustained by private profit.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;Among the Congress Members listed was New York&#039;s own Carolyn Maloney. <br /><br />Dino criticized Maloney for her Socialist ties.&nbsp; He stated that her adherence to the DSA&#039;s beliefs makes her unfit to represent a District sustained by the financial industry.&nbsp; Mr. LaVerghetta stated:<br /><br /><em>Carolyn Maloney&#039;s membership in the Socialist Party is simultaneously shocking and wholly unsurprising.&nbsp; It has long been known in political circles that Maloney is bored by economics and confused by finance.&nbsp; Her membership in an organization that openly rejects the notion of private profit, however, proves that Carolyn Maloney actually has contempt for the free market system that made this country great.&nbsp; Carolyn Maloney represents the financial center of the universe, yet she apparently opposes our free-market capitalist system.&nbsp; Don&#039;t the People of our District deserve a Representative that believes their work has value?&nbsp; Shouldn&#039;t their voice in Washington be one that speaks up for their interests rather than one that vehemently opposes them? <br /><br />In truth, however, we should have seen this coming.&nbsp; When asked to choose between putting her trust in government or the individual, Carolyn Maloney has chosen the government every time.&nbsp; This is someone who has vocally opposed making the 2003 tax cuts permanent, proposed taxing Wall Street bonuses at 100%, voted for wasteful government stimulus packages, voted for the disastrous Obamacare legislation, and voted for the stifling financial regulations recently passed by Congress. <br /><br />Disturbingly, Carolyn Maloney is the Chair of the Joint Economics Committee.&nbsp; This is a job she has never taken seriously.&nbsp; For example, instead of appointing an expert as the Committee&#039;s General Counsel, she appointed her election lawyer, Andrew Tulloch.&nbsp; I guess we shouldn&#039;t expect anything more from a card-carrying member of the DSA.&nbsp; Why should she take her role on the Joint Economic Committee seriously when she thinks our economic system is a joke? <br /></em><br />

				This campaign has the be the most expensive in local history. So far I had at least 6 people ringing my bell and asking me to vote for Maloney or Reshma. All my years in Astoria I&#039;ve never had even one person ringing my bell, this year it&#039;s out of control. Several mailing a week. I got 3 from Maloney just today. Isn&#039;t this overkill?

				Returns at around 11:30 PM have Maloney trouncing the Carpetbagger about 80% to 20%.<br /><br />All those placards staple-gunned into trees and the operatives I saw on the street looked to be the same machine of college bodies I saw last summer canvasing for Bloomberg.&#160; As one of henchpeople bugged me getting off the N at 36th around 7:30 I was being barked at not to forget to vote.&#160; Once told I&#039;d already voted this AM he made sure to let me know how confident he was that I&#039;d voted for Saujani.&#160; I stridently told this upstart that I hoped this was the last ballot in New York State that I&#039;d ever see the carpetbagger&#039;s name again, and the next time she was involved in a hedge fund about to be looted she should spread the wealth around more.
