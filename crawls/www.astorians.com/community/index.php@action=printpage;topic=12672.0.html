				Sometime late Tuesday night or Wednesday morning someone decided to clean out his closet and give a few of his clothes away. <br /><br />While there&#039;s nothing wrong with giving away your unwanted clothes, putting them in a cardboard box with a piece of paper strapped to one of the flaps saying, &quot;Help Yourself&quot; and placing it on the sidewalk underneath the trestle on 33rd St and 23rd Ave is the most asinine thing they could have done with them. <br /><br />Why, you idiot, did you think placing the box there, instead of in front of where you live would have been a better idea? It&#039;s not. It&#039;s just not your problem to have to deal with anymore by tossing it out of sight. What annoys me is that you might sleep at night and think that you&#039;ve done your community a service. You haven&#039;t. <br /><br />There are clothes drop boxes all over, a thrift store a block away, churches you could have donated them to... but no, you chose dump them in a cardboard box and leave it outside on the street. <br /><br />You&#039;re a douche. <br /><br />&nbsp;

				wow, i dont think its that serious to bash the person trying to do a good thing or even thread worthy...but sounds to me that if the person left it under a trestle, it may have been left for a certain sombody, perhaps a homless person who frequently go under the trestle to rest....<br /><br />

				I dont think the poster had a problem with the person donating clothes. The problem is, that leaving boxes lying around on the sidewalk is essentially garbage and makes the neighborhood look bad. If he was leaving it for a specific person, then it should have been given directly to that person, or to any local church or shelter. We here in Astoria do not need more things just lying around in our streets.

But then they would have sealed the box or found an opportunity to stop by when they might be there and not posted the note along with the box. <br /><br />It&#039;ll rain today, the box will get wet and the clothes will get ruined. People will begin throwing their trash into it. It&#039;ll be there for days, maybe even weeks. <br /><br />There was a tire that sat there for last few weeks, got filled with trash and finally, the City carted it away. <br /><br /><br />

				Living next door to a clothing drop box, I gotta say the whole thing is a pain. &nbsp;Nearly every week we&#039;ve got some jerk or another who leaves stuff next to the box (I guess when it is full) and it ends up scattered all over the effing place. &nbsp;Or alternatively, some jerk or another figures out a way of pulling stuff out of the box and leaves the discards scattered all over the effing place. &nbsp;I&#039;m all for donating, and I&#039;m all for people who need it to resort to self-help. &nbsp;But please, let&#039;s remember that doing good does not mean being inconsiderate. &nbsp;Ugh don&#039;t get me started on the scattered crap in front of the Salvation Army store because people cannot manage to come when the store is open.

				Anyone else ever see a news report on clothing donation boxes? I&#039;m pretty sure the majority of clothing collected by them is essentially recycled and sold to people in developing nations. This is usually to the benefit of a single individual/corporation regardless of the charitable sounding name on the sound of the box.<br /><br />I think that it&#039;s an excellent business idea and am pretty sure that it&#039;s lucrative. You have to wonder what kind of person runs a business like this however. Personally I think that it is a little deceptive to donators. About a month ago I red &quot; A Crime so Monstrous - Face-to-Face With Modern-Day Slavery&quot; by Benjiman Skinner. One chapter focused on a Haitian restivik girl living in the U.S.&nbsp; whose adopted abusive father owned one of these businesses and was very successful. He eventually fled to Haiti under charges of sexual assult/ rape.

				I don&#039;t even like walking under that trestle. I imagine that any box of clothing left there would be immediately covered with pigeon crap and get soaking wet from that pipe that leaks.

				Most likely, this person is lazy and stupid, not a douche...&nbsp; Lazy because he was too lazy to get up and make it to a drop box, and stupid because he really believed that leaving a box outside and telling people to help themselves really would help them..&nbsp; Hopefully now that this has been called out into the open, others will think twice before doing this.

				I keep seeing this thread and thinking it&#039;s about a different kind of douche.&nbsp; And the &quot;help yourself&quot; throws me off and I end up thinking someone&#039;s giving away douches.
