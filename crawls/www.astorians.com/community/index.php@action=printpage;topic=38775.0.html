				The manager from Alba&#039;s told me this today: Alba&#039;s purchased the Square Hardware property, decided not to expand their restaurant, and instead leased the space to guys from Uncle Jack&#039;s.&nbsp; It is uncertain what the name of the new venture will be called or what the cuisine might be, but my bet is on some type of steak coming to Ditmars.

				Seconded. Spoke to the owner of Alba&#039;s and he was a bit cagey, but I got the steakhouse thing as well. Didn&#039;t specify the name, only that &quot;have a couple others around&quot;. He&#039;s okay with it- no pizza and different clientele

				I was hoping sooner than August but better late than never.&nbsp; This will be a nice addition to the Ditmars restaurant scene.&nbsp; I believe S Prime is closed (maybe for good?).&nbsp; Meet the Meat is quite good.&nbsp; I&#039;m not a fan of Christos.&nbsp; Uncle Jacks will be a solid steakhouse with great experience behind it.

				Agreed.&nbsp; It will be nice to mix it up.&nbsp; There are plenty of places in the Ditmars area to get a nice steak.&nbsp; I love the steaks at El Olivo.&nbsp; But an actual steakhouse should be a great addition.&nbsp; And if it has to be a Food Network &quot;star&quot; then at least it isn&#039;t that awful Guy Fieri

				And hopefully it&#039;ll have aesthetics with the hype of being a speakeasy-- sawdust on the floors, some bar through a doorway, etc.<br /><br /><br />Queens needs to catch up on the &quot;Crif Dogs/Raines&quot; market.

				There are currently three locations, Ditmars would be the fourth. They are all variations of this:<br /><br />http://www.unclejacks.com/bayside-photo-gallery.php (http://www.unclejacks.com/bayside-photo-gallery.php)<br /><br />

				It&#039;s a great place.&nbsp; When I don&#039;t get the Fred Flintstone steak, I would get the surf and turf with the Brazilian Lobster Tail.&nbsp; It&#039;s one of the best lobster tails you will have anywhere.
