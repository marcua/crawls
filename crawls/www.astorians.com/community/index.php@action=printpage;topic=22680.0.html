				Just was told by the bartender that works at No Partners Bar (29-11 21st Avenue) that there was a stabbing/knife attack at the bar.&nbsp; This occurred during the early hours (3am - 4am) of May 6th.<br />According to the bartender, six hispanic men came into the bar for a <em>few.&nbsp; </em>Everyone was having a good time until the bar was about to close.&nbsp; One of the six men became irate over the closing of the bar and demanded to be served further.&nbsp; The unknown suspect(s) attacked the owner and slashed his face/neck.&nbsp; A patron came to the owner&#039;s defense and attacked the assailant(s) with a poolstick.&nbsp; This patron then became the next target and was slashed in the arm. <br />The owner is still being treated as we speak and the patron has been released.<br />The group of men in question have yet to be found and the incident is currently being investigated by the NYPD.&nbsp; **Hopefully the security cameras will provide results**<br />If you know something, say something - contact the local 114th PCT.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;
