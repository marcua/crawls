				All call to volunteers --<br /><br />We are looking for a volunteer (or a few) to fill out the ranks in helping us get the leftover veggies to the food pantry drop off at 21st Street (near 36th Ave).<br /><br />Ideally you&#39;d be able to commit to every distribution -- but even just a few would be incredibly helpful.&nbsp; You&#39;ll swing by around 7:30 to pick up leftovers and <strong>drive</strong> them to Hour Children (the previously mentioned food pantry).&nbsp; You get in return, in addition to the satisfaction of having done a great deed, our thanks AND an understanding that in taking on delivery, you&#39;ve fulfilled ALL of your required volunteer work.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you are interested in being involved in part of the food pantry shuttle -- full time or part time -- please let me know!&nbsp; Write info at hellgatecsa dot com or shoot me a PM.<br /><br />thanks,<br />Jayme -- Hellgate CSA, Site Coordinator

				Additional info:<br /><br />This would be in the evenings (PM), immediately following distribution.&nbsp; <br /><br />You can plan to come late and we&#39;ll save your veggies for you.<br /><br />There are 15-20 shares that go to Hour Children -- part purchased by them, part donated by us, part leftover.&nbsp; So figure 2-4 boxes of produce.&nbsp; <br /><br />
