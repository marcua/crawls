				So about a month ago I received the BEST gift EVER from a coworker. It&#039;s an antique wind-up Honora watch with a mother of pearl face. I was so freakin&#039; excited to get it I wore it around all proud like. Until that night at the gym, when my friend dropped it, and it stopped working.&nbsp; :cry:&nbsp; So I&#039;m pretty determined to get it fixed. I went into the Honora store on 57th &amp; 5th and the people there were all flippin&#039; out over the watch, saying that it was probably one of the first ones they made, and they actually took a photocopy of it to show the owner. Weird. But, they said they couldn&#039;t fix it. So I wanna take it somewhere and I&#039;ve checked out places online but I don&#039;t know who to trust. Can anyone recommend a good old or antique watch repair place? I don&#039;t care if it&#039;s in Astoria or on the moon, as long as they are good. <br /><br />thanks in advance

				The American Watch Guild itself is located at 257 Adams Lane in Hewlett.&nbsp; Security Jewelers is in Duluth, MN (Minnesota).<br /><br />Here (http://www.americanwatchguild.com/retailers.php?jump=&amp;s_state=NY) is the Guild&#039;s list of New York-based watch retailers.&nbsp; Clicking on the link beside each listing will give you detail as to whether that particular location does watch repair, and/or works with antique watches.
