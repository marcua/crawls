				This particular block is all houses that are of very similar styles.&nbsp; A few weeks ago I noticed construction on one of the houses....wasn&#039;t really sure exactly what type of construction they might be doing.&nbsp; Now it seems patently clear: they removed the roof, all to add on an additional top floor (or two?) and then will apparently put a new roof over that.&nbsp; I also notice that the entire building now appears empty.&nbsp; Prior to this I assumed it was just the existing owners doing some type of construction, but with all that&#039;s going on in Astoria I now assume that the house was sold, and that the new (greedy?) owners want to cash-in on the gentrification and make even more in rent.&nbsp; <br /><br />So if one house was allowed to do it, what&#039;s to say that more houses (esp once they are sold...as another house on this very block is for sale...) what&#039;s to stop other new owners from adding another floor or two?<br /><br />The unending greed of people never ceases to amaze me.&nbsp; Who cares about the neighborhood....we just want MoneyMoneyMoney!

				Same on 43rd between Ditmars and 23rd Avenue. It&#039;s the second to put at least one floor on top. This one is two extra floors. First one still looks of place and this one appears even stranger. It&#039;s even overhanging out over the back edge of original building.
