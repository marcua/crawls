				Marched yesterday.&nbsp; Alexa should be posting some of the pictures of her, grotto and I there.&nbsp; It was a well done event.&nbsp; I think a hundred grand was topped.&nbsp; After we marched around the capitol dome and swung back, we started heading down the hill on Indepedence Avenue (I think).&nbsp; We saw throngs of people ahead of us and throngs still not even past the starting point!&nbsp; Excellent!<br /><br />Three tips to anyone who marches in DC in the future:<br />1.&nbsp; If you are going to use the WMATA train for any reason, purchase your tickets ($2.35 each way) ahead of time online.&nbsp; The wait to buy tickets at the Greenbelt station was a half an hour.&nbsp; <br />2.&nbsp; Afterwards, eat the &quot;hangover burger&quot; at the Austin Grill on Avenue E and 7th.&nbsp; Greasy burger topped with jalapenos, cheese, bacon, chili and a fried egg.&nbsp; I think you get to eat five of those in your life before you die!<br />3.&nbsp; For those such inclined, I understand that smoking bashing is really the only PC sport out there where some frustrations can be worked off, but for crying out loud, keep them to yourselves at a peace march!&nbsp; Getting narc&#39;d on by a fellow marcher is just plain sad (happened to our group twice.&nbsp; It was outside and it wasn&#39;t even 420)

				I&#39;ve never posted a pic yet, So this is a test run...<br /><br />March was cool....tons of people, but certainly not reminiscent of thirty years ago....<br /><br />People prepared intensely for the march, make-up, costumes....if someone had told me it was Mardi Gras and not a protest march, I wouldn&#39;t havek been surprised...<br /><br />Okay, the pic attachment didn&#39;t work...I&#39;ll have to figure that out.
