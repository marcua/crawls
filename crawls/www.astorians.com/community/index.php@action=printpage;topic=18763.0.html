				(http://i47.tinypic.com/10ygpe1.jpg)<br /><br />I just so happened to be walking to work at 9am when I passed the scene.&nbsp; The firefighters were evacuating everyone in the building and neighboring locations and running the hose through each house.&nbsp; People were outside with their pets, ect.&nbsp; My heart broke to pieces when I saw a cat in the 2nd story window freaking out.&nbsp; It finally jumped onto an awning and two firefighters grabbed the cat.

				All humans are safe, although the second-floor residents of four adjoining houses have been burned out.<br /><br />I just spoke with Anna, the cat&#039;s owner. The cat is currently missing, presumed freaked. I&#039;m awaiting a photo of the missing cat and will post it here for neighbors to keep an eye out. Anna and her daughter had only just moved into that apartment and now they have to find new housing.

I used to live in one of those homes, 23-23, which is the white one on the right, right next to the Amtrak trestle. We, and our dog, spent 6-7 hours outside, in the sweltering heat, on what was perhaps the hottest day of the year. The red cross gave us 2 nights and then we were on our own. I won&#039;t even go in detail here about what happened at their offices in Manhattan, but suffice it to say that they will NEVER get any money from again. AFAIK the fire started at 23-19 where Annie lived,not 23-17 like others have said, but don&#039;t quote me on it.

				That&#039;s unfortunate about your experience in the RC office. If you were treated rudely, you should report the issue to the supervisor.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the deal--I am a Red Cross volunteer responder and I got called away from my regular job to help out on the 6th. We had 14 fires and vacates that day, and at the time the Astoria fire was going there were three other fires waiting for responders.<br /><br />The last I heard, the city cut Red Cross funding by 75% for this year. 40 people have lost their jobs in layoffs. <br /><br />There just isn&#039;t the money to put everyone up in 4-star hotels for an unlimited time. The Red Cross has contracts with hotels that will house people on no notice, within the five boroughs. The housing is of last resort, for people who don&#039;t have friends or families who can or will put them up. The goal is to get people off the street, into a safe place, for the first 24 to 72 hours after a disaster. Beyond that is the realm of other agencies.<br /><br />(We just closed the shelter we opened the next day for the dozens of families displaced by the two 5-alarm fires in other areas in Queens. You might have noticed http://origin.ny1.com/content/top_stories/121859/firefighters--union--fdny-sees-busiest-week-in-decades (http://origin.ny1.com/content/top_stories/121859/firefighters--union--fdny-sees-busiest-week-in-decades) this article, noting that the FDNY had its busiest week in 30 years. That means the Red Cross had ITS busiest week in NYC in decades.)<br /><br />If you want to know what really goes in to the 2600+ responses every year, come and volunteer.<br /><br />

				Thanks, BoredTemp. I just wish more people knew what the Red Cross does locally, and what the limitations are. <br /><br />95% of us are volunteers, and we would love to be able to give everyone what they want all the time. But resources are really limited. <br /><br />As of 20 minutes ago, we&#039;ve had 103 jobs since July 1--if it keeps up like this, I just don&#039;t know how we&#039;ll handle it.
