				This sounds very interesting, but unfortunately I work in the city all day and it takes me over a half hour to get back to Astoria.. half hour there, hour meeting, half-hour back.. I probably would not be able to take 2 hours off for lunch. &nbsp; &nbsp;:cry:

				I know, it <em>is</em> a very uncommon time to hold an event, but<br />No worries...after each &quot;brunch&quot; I usually do a write up of the material covered with links to the relevant data; so whereas I can't guarantee you food for the body, the food for the mind is still freely available :-) ... but if by chance or ill fortune you happen to be out of a job or starving on Mondays, or God forbid you have a day off!, you know where to come; there will be a meal waiting ;-)<br /><br />P.S.: Even though you may not be physically present please feel free to contribute to the discussion anyway, your input is not only needed but desired.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />-Zeno.<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />&nbsp;Technology: General Discussion (http://astorians.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=814)

				Title: <strong>Social Engineering</strong><br />
				Post by: <strong>zeno</strong> on <strong>November 27, 2005, 09:11:22 PM</strong>

			<dd class="postbody">
				By popular demand, this weeks topic will focus on one of the more exciting as well as confounding aspects of security penetration testing and information gathering disciplines... namely Social Engineering.<br /><br />Social engineering is a vast topic about as complex and convoluted as the human mind itself. It is no secret that the greatest weakness in an airtight security system could very well be the humans involved in that system, whether they make errors in the construction or operation of said system or even lacked the procedures to deal with every imaginable situation or foreknowledge of every possible scenario.<br /><br />It has been said quite humorously that &quot;there is no patch for human stupidity&quot; but before we get down upon ourselves be it known that some of the most reknowned con-men in history have said over and over again that human is immune to being duped. So long as greed, shame, fear of authority, ignorance of procedures or lack of expertise regarding complex technological systems, and a willingness to please exists there will always be social engineering.<br /><br />Social engineering is not only not new but I believe that everyone who is alive today has at least some experience in it. Have you ever bragged about an accomplishment that you haven't achieved or exaggerated an existing one to either gain respect from someone or try to make them like you, or have you ever bluffed yourself out of a fist fight with a guy twice your size or begged your parents for money for that awesome new text book for college when it was never really your intention to buy it but rather use your parents hard earned cash to spend a night out on the town with all the nice looking guys or gals, or obtained the keys to the car when it was never your intention to go bowling <em>in the first place</em>, or bought your lover chocolates for Valentine's Day for the promise of love or sex? If you have said yes to any of these questions or questions similar to these then chances are that you are a successful social engineer.<br /><br />But, social engineering is not only about deception. If you have ever wore a suit to a job interview, put on deoderant, chewed on a breath-mint and then sincerely answered the questions (without fibbing) that were posed to you and got the job, then you should also be given a certificate in SE. And if you really want to get the graduate degree in Social Engineering, then I suggest taking some college courses in advertising, marketing, psychology, diplomacy, acting, or public relations. Salespeople are known to be adept at playing on human emotions in order to achieve a certain end, as well as politicians, clergymen, dogs and babies.<br /><br />We will return to this subject again throughout the oncoming months, but maybe not as fequently as may be desired, as (I reitereate) this subject crosses many boundaries and is not limited to the technological.<br /><br />So, this Monday we will be listening (gods and goddesses willing) to actual examples of social engineering that were performed at the Fifth Hope (Hackers on Planet Earth) Conference in NYC, and it will be up to the listeners to decide whether the whole thing was staged,<br />or not...<br /><br />Bless you and may you always remain sceptical and follow proper security procedures,<br /><br />----Zeno(Content-Free)
