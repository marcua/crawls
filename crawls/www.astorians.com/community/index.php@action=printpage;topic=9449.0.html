				I find the story insulting actually and another attempt by the US to impose our laws on other countries.<br /><br />The Bush administration wants the EU to do it&#039;s dirty work. This change will essentially only affect countries that fall under the visa waiver program. Why don&#039;t we just do away with it altogether and make everyone get visas to visit. That way we&#039;ll know who&#039;s coming into the country.<br /><br />This kind of policy seems innocuous&nbsp; but it instills fear in and actively discourages people who want to visit the US and spend their money here -- which I may add, we desperately need.<br /><br />

The program was established in 1986 with the objective of eliminating unnecessary barriers to travel, stimulating the tourism industry, and permitting the Department of State to focus consular resources in other areas. VWP eligible travelers may apply for a visa, if they prefer to do so. Not all countries participate in the VWP, and not all travelers from VWP countries are eligible to use the program. VWP travelers are screened prior to admission into the United States, and they are enrolled in the Department of Homeland Security’s US-VISIT&nbsp; &nbsp;program.<br /><strong><br />Which countries participate in the Visa Waiver Program (VWP)?</strong><br /><br />Currently, 27 countries participate in the Visa Waiver Program, as shown below:<br /><br />Visa Waiver Program - Participating Countries.<br />Andorra&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Iceland&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Norway<br />Australia &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ireland &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Portugal<br />Austria &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Italy &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; San Marino<br />Belgium &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Japan &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore<br />Brunei &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Liechtenstein &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slovenia<br />Denmark &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luxembourg &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spain<br />Finland &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monaco &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweden<br />France &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Netherlands &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Switzerland<br />Germany &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Zealand &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;United Kingdom<br /><br />How Does a Country Qualify for Visa Waiver?<br /><br />Select Visa Waiver Program - How a Country Qualifies&nbsp; to learn more.<br /><br />Which travelers may use the Visa Waiver Program to enter the United States?<br /><br />Nationals of the 27 countries participating in the Visa Waiver Program may use VWP if:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * The purpose of their stay in the United States is 90 days or less for tourism or business (if in doubt, travelers should check with the nearest Embassy or Consulate to verify that what they plan to do is considered tourism or business. Transit through the United States is generally permitted. Note that foreign media representatives planning to engage in that vocation in the United States are not eligible, as the purpose of their stay does not qualify as “business”. These professionals must obtain a nonimmigrant media (I) visa. See&nbsp; media visa&nbsp; &nbsp;for more information. Also see&nbsp; Visitor Visas&nbsp; &nbsp;– Business and Pleasure;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * They present a machine-readable passport (MRP) valid for six months past their expected stay in the United States (unless country-specific agreements&nbsp; provide exemptions). This includes all categories of passports -- regular, diplomatic, and official, when the traveler is seeking to enter the United States for business or tourist purposes, for a maximum of 90 days<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Depending on when VWP travelers’ passports were issued, other passport requirements will apply. Please refer to the&nbsp; &nbsp;Visa Waiver Program Traveler Guide&nbsp; &nbsp;on the United States CBP website for additional details on this program. These passport requirements are:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Machine-readable passports issued or renewed/extended on or after 10/26/06 – integrated&nbsp; &nbsp;chip with information from the data page (e-Passport)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Machine-readable passports issued or renewed/extended between 10/26/05 and 10/25/06 – requires digital photograph printed on data page or integrated chip with information from the data page<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Machine-readable passports issued or renewed/extended before 10/26/05 – no further requirements<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * They have complied with the conditions of previous admissions under the Visa Waiver Program, and have not been found ineligible for a U.S. visa; and<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * If arriving by air or sea, they are traveling on an approved carrier (almost all major airlines and cruise ship companies are currently approved carriers - copies of carrier lists may be requested from the Department of Homeland Security’s National Fines Office at 1525 Wilson Blvd., Arlington, VA. 22209), and have a return trip ticket to any foreign destination.*; or<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * They can demonstrate the intent to stay 90 days or less in the United States and demonstrate sufficient funds to support themselves while in the United States.&nbsp;

How far do background checks have to go? I fear that next we&#039;ll have travel bans on anyone with anything that could be construed as remotely objectionable in their background. <br /><br />Now the target is Muslims, and given the current world situation maybe this is warranted. But these laws don&#039;t go away. Who will they be applied to next -- intellectuals? critics of the government? You can say &quot;oh that could never happen here&quot; I&#039;m not so sure anymore and I don&#039;t hold much hope the Democrats will roll back these rules. In the UK, the Labour party, which can be likened to the Democrats, is at the forefront on implementing laws that curtail civil liberties in the name of security.<br /><br />I think this is yet again another example of a US policy presented in &quot;it&#039;s our way or the highway&quot; manner. We don&#039;t need to lecture the EU on security. They are more at risk from terrorism than the US and they know it. I don&#039;t know what the Bush administartion hopes to accomplish by making threats to get its way. If we want more checks we should carry them out ourselves and not push off the responsibility and expense on other countries.<br /><br />This kind of policy makes people afraid of the US and discourages them from coming here. I think this would be very unfortunate for us as a country. We need friends.

				At this point, I see any fears that we will target intellectuals or critics of the government as unfounded.&nbsp; The visa waiver program was questionable policy in the first place, and even more so given recent world events.&nbsp; For example, doctors are a shoo in for visa waivers, and it was a bunch of doctors who perpetrated the recent car bomb attacks in London and at Glasgow airport.<br /><br />I also object to the assertion that we are targeting Muslims.&nbsp; While the vast preponderance of terror attacks of the last 30 years have been committed by Islamic radicals, there is at least some sophistication on the part of our national security apparatus to understand that we are not targeting people of one religion or national origin.&nbsp; In fact, most airport screening as I understand it is behavioral in nature.<br /><br />Also, it could be argued that the Europe is at greater risk of terror attacks because of their own poor policy.&nbsp; Take as an example Great Britain, where some Muslim communities have become increasingly insular and the authorities do little, if anything to engage them.&nbsp; They have all but allowed them to institute sharia.&nbsp; The same can be said of France and many of the Scandinavian countries.

				Bill we&#039;ll have to disagree. There have been many reported cases of academics being denied visas to come to the US and it&#039;s disturbing. Is it because these academics support terrorism...or for other reasons? We don&#039;t know why and that is because the State Department refuses to give a reason for the denials.<br /><br />http://www.expressindia.com/news/fullstory.php?newsid=63339 (http://www.expressindia.com/news/fullstory.php?newsid=63339)<br />http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2005/11/11/suit (http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2005/11/11/suit)<br />http://www.nearinternational.org/alerts/united_states_of_america1220060321en.php (http://www.nearinternational.org/alerts/united_states_of_america1220060321en.php)<br />http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/nation/20050316-1416-aclu-visadenials.html (http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/nation/20050316-1416-aclu-visadenials.html)<br />http://www.insidehighered.com/views/2007/02/12/knight (http://www.insidehighered.com/views/2007/02/12/knight)<br /><br />The problem here, at least to me, is not that the visas were denied. The State Department may have had good reason but if the people mentioned in the above links are so dangerous we should at least know why they are not allowed to come to this country.<br /><br />Also, the security measures implemented in recent years are a direct response to 9/11 and Islamic terrorism. If they weren&#039;t meant to target Muslims who in your opinion are they meant to target, especially given that as you say many terrorist attacks in the past 30 years (outside the US mind you) have been commited by Muslims?<br />

				28Grand, you&#039;re right in that the State Department should disclose the reasoning behind their denial of the visas.&nbsp; I am not a fan of huge government agencies, as they tend to make mistakes and curtail our personal liberties. Personally, I don&#039;t believe that the intent was to deny academic dissenters access to the U.S.&nbsp; We have a long tradition of academic dissent here in the U.S.&nbsp; But I am a firm believer in government transparency, and it would be comforting to know their reasoning.<br /><br />I&#039;m not comfortable with saying that the policies target &quot;Muslims&quot; as this conjures up the image of an innocent Muslim family being thrown in the klink somewhere.&nbsp; If you were to say that we&#039;re targeting Islamic radicals along with any others with intent to harm the U.S. and our interests, I&#039;d feel better about that.

				Billz you are an optimist and much more generous than I am -- and I&#039;m glad for it because someone has to be! &nbsp;:-)<br /><br />We HAD a long tradition of rigorous academic debate and dissent in this country.

I know this is a generalization but I think you&#039;ll find that the vast majority of people stopped at airport security checkpoints are of Muslim origin or appearance. <br /><br />Also, there have been more than a handful of cases of American <em>citizens</em> of Muslim appearance or origin being detained without merit. And how many people held on terrorism charges are non-Muslim?<br /><br />Yes, given the time in which we live, Islamic radicals should be identified and possibly excluded from the US. I wouldn&#039;t argue that the US Government shouldn&#039;t do this. But I am suggesting that this policy has been exceeded and other &quot;types&quot; of people are being targeted for reason unknown.<br />

				I didn&#039;t say the US is persecuting Muslims, though I think it is entirely reasonable for a Muslim to think so. <br /><br />Persecuting is too drastic a word in my opinion. I am suggesting the US is targeting Muslims and applying extra scrunity, rightly or wrongly. I acknowledge the fairness and efficacy of such scrutiny is open to debate but innocent people, including American citizens, are being caught up in it. It&#039;s not fair to dismiss their situations as tough luck.<br /><br />If you believe overt security measures, i.e., TSA screeners at airports, make decisions based on behavior alone and not behavior AND ethnicity and appearance then I&#039;m sorry I feel you are being naive.<br /><br />Covert measures, screening passenger lists and credit card transactions are not so objective. Rightly or wrongly, do you think all sorts of names are searched for and compared? I doubt Mr. John Smith would warrant a seconds pause. I&#039;m not so sure about someone named Mr Mohammed Alawi.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=9449.msg112282.html#msg112282">Quote from: Debbie on February 13, 2008, 04:59:29 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I think something even worse than this is the law abiding, peace loving Americans who were placed on a &#039;no fly&#039; list due to their peace related activities.&nbsp; Just imagine this!</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I have no doubt this is true.

We want foreign governments to foot the bill so our airlines and our State Department don’t have to.<br /><br />Regulations have gotten more stringent, maybe this was necessary but I’m not convinced these extra hurdles being proposed actually provide additional protection and I wonder why current regulations aren’t sufficient. <br /><br />What I am convinced of though is that when our country implements rules in what can be construed as an arrogant manner, it sends out negative signals to the rest of the world that say “Stay away! You are not welcome!”<br /><br />This leads to a second irony in that as we willing slide into isolation from the rest of the world, we may be unhappy and suspicious to have foreign visitors come to our shores but we are more than happy to accept their cash – given that it’s money borrowed from overseas investors that fuels our economy and maintains our high standard of living.

We want foreign governments to foot the bill so our airlines and our State Department don’t have to.<br /><br />Regulations have gotten more stringent, maybe this was necessary but I’m not convinced these extra hurdles being proposed actually provide additional protection and I wonder why current regulations aren’t sufficient. <br /><br />What I am convinced of though is that when our country implements rules in what can be construed as an arrogant manner, it sends out negative signals to the rest of the world that say “Stay away! You are not welcome!”<br /><br />This leads to a second irony in that as we willing slide into isolation from the rest of the world, we may be unhappy and suspicious to have foreign visitors come to our shores but we are more than happy to accept their cash – given that it’s money borrowed from overseas investors that fuels our economy and maintains our high standard of living.

				neo11--If you look back in the thread, I have already stated that I believe disclosure of offense is necessary. The fact that they don&#039;t do this does bother me.<br /><br />28Grand-- I have to say that on many respects I agree with Sweeper about the conclusions he&#039;s made. I&#039;ve lead unionization efforts, peace protests and even for a while got involved with ASNWR (quite by accident, but that&#039;s a long story) and I&#039;ve never had any inkling of the trouble Debbie&#039;s encountered. <br /><br />So I have to wonder what the difference is. Part of the problem is that we&#039;ll never know because disclosure and governmental transparency are so lacking at this time in America.<br /><br />However, I do have to say that given other parts of Debbie&#039;s posts--from the insistence in the Muslim thread that she is a victim to the claim that she supports soldiers more than the &quot;Conservative&quot; ilk on the board to her saying that she is more successful than most here--she comes across as being hostile and noncooperative. I believe that self righteousness and the opinion that one is better than others can often lead people to be more suspicious of you. I can&#039;t help but wonder if she approached the TSA authorities in the same way she approaches people on the board that disagree with her. And, if so, could this be a contributing factor to being singled out.<br /><br />While it certainly isn&#039;t fair, and shouldn&#039;t be done, I believe that there is often a rational explaination for things and that Mackhom&#039;s Razor is generally true: the simplest explaination is the most often true. <br /><br />I doubt that they&#039;re looking up lisence plates for every member of Moveon.org or that they&#039;re all on the No Fly list. I&#039;m sure there are inappropriate things being done with the No Fly list, I just don&#039;t think that the minor civil disobedience discribed here is what adds someone to those lists.

				Wrong.&nbsp; The Red Brigades.&nbsp; Sinn Fein.&nbsp; ETA.&nbsp; 17 November.&nbsp; These are all well-known European terrorist groups that were primarily active in the 70s and 80s, some even into the 90s, ETA even up until today.&nbsp; None of them have anything to do with Islamic extremism, or Islam at all for that matter.
