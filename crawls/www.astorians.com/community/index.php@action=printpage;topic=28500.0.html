				Ordered a pizza from Rizzo&#039;s and there was a letter attached to it that informed us that they will no longer be accepting ordered from online third parties as of January 1. It says the reason is because of the lack of personal interaction and relationships with customers that the online sales are causing. <br /><br /><br />So, they ask that you request delivery by phone. This confuses me, because I don&#039;t know too many times where you call a pizza place and get chummy with the person taking your order to the point where you really develop a &quot;personal relationship,&quot; but alright. Just sounds odd.

				They actually do interact with the customers (at least our family) they&#039;ve remembered what we&#039;ve ordered, asked how we&#039;re doing and even added extras to our orders so we can try new stuff. <br />We&#039;re not big on seamless or grub hub, I&#039;ve always just phoned stuff in to places. We only order out one a week but I&#039;ve found a lot of places are really good about remembering what we&#039;ve ordered or if we pick up they know our names and order. <br />It works- we&#039;re treated nicely so we keep giving them our business :)

				They don&#039;t want to have relationships with those companies because they are surely sick of paying them a cut of every order (and I believe a subscription fee to be listed). I suspect the issue is that many people who used to call Rizzo&#039;s directly now order via one of these services- which costs Rizzo&#039;s money. A compromise would be to charge more for orders placed via these services- although I&#039;m not sure if those companies allow it.<br /><br /><br />For an established business like Rizzo&#039;s, this could be a good move.

				I&#039;ve never been a huge fan of Rizzo&#039;s pizza -- even since they&#039;ve expanded their menu (back in the day, they only had the squares). My wife likes it, though, so we&#039;d order from time to time to make her happy. Now that they&#039;re off Seamless, we won&#039;t have to order it anymore since we rarely have cash in the house and like the convenience of ordering online.

				Maybe the sexting them in the &quot;Add Special Instructions&quot; had the opposite effect. Rats.

The sites generally do not allow restaurants to charge more. The restaurants can always opt to charge delivery fees to make it up...the Bel Aire Diner started doing this a few months ago.
