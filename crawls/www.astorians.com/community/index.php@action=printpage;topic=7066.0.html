				Hello,<br />I am semi-new to the area and i am looking for a cool place to have my 30th!&nbsp; I have about 20 guests...I would like outdoor space (backyard or rooftop)..I don&#039;t have to have the space to myself...it can be a public venue...<br />I called Cavo and I am waiting for them to call me back.&nbsp; But i think that i have to book a party...like pay 60 bucks per person...<br />open to suggestions<br />thanks =)

				I did my birthday last year at the Beer Garden and had about 30 people there.&nbsp; It turned out pretty well as we did it early on a Friday night (started getting there around 5:30) so we could get tables.&nbsp; Then people could come and go as they pleased although some had to wait on the inevitable long line.&nbsp; Plus there&#039;s plenty of food from the menu and the grill.<br /><br />If you are looking for a smaller outdoor space I&#039;d suggest talking to the people at Fatty&#039;s on Ditmars as they have an outdoor space.

				Cavo probably wouldn&#039;t have a minimum charge per person, but the night would be expensive either way.&nbsp; If it was a smaller group, I would say go for it, but with 20 people, that bill could get out of hand real fast.&nbsp; I would recommend Beer Garden but cannot stress enough about having everyone there real early.&nbsp; The line that forms on the weekends can be very long indeed.&nbsp; Why not try Stini Yamas or Hell Gate Social? Both have outdoor areas and will allow you to order in food.&nbsp; Very friendly staff and usually not very crowded.

I always forget about that place, but it is a great space and the staff is really nice.

				Indigo on 31st Street also has an outdoor space.<br /><br />Went to a birthday party (2, actually) at Hell Gate Social, and both times were nice.&nbsp; You&#039;ll probably have to clear out your food by 9 or 10, though, as per management&#039;s request.

				I forgot about Indigo, yeah, and they serve food there.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s really nice there. As far as food at Hell Gate, I think you only have to clear out your food if there&#039;s a dj/event happening later on in the evening.&nbsp; Which is usually on the weekends.&nbsp; I went on a Monday and the menus were offered up to us by the owner well into the evening, but it wasn&#039;t a busy night.&nbsp; So I guess it depends on what night your party will be.
