				Everyone in the neighborhood complains about this. Isn&#039;t there something we can do? Ticket agents hang out in front of every school at drop-off and pick-up time and ticket the parents cars when they run in to pick up their children. Technically, small children have to be picked up and dropped off inside the school. I only use a car on bad weather days, but I know plenty of other parents who drop off using cars on a daily basis. I understand that some of the private schools have tried lobbying the DOT to change the signs and rules regarding pick up and drop off or to give placards to cars that are dropping off/picking up but DOT isn&#039;t cooperating and defers to the city, while the city defers to DOT. Anybody know anything about this? Anybody interested in getting together as a group to &quot;scream and yell&quot; about this?

				I had this problem a few years back. I made a sign and left it on the dashboard, something like &quot;pls. don&#039;t ticket, dropping off small child at school, will return in a minute.&quot; From what I can remember it worked. Probably thru off the traffic cops (who for the most part are like robots walking around trying to fill a quota...).

				I had that happen to me and i wasn&#039;t even double parked.<br />We have no standing signs during school hours- so i argued with the agent but he told me to call the city and complain. What did work, is that i got a letter from the school and the ticket was dismissed.<br /><br />Good luck!
