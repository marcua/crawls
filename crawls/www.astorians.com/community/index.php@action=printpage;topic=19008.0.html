				I was struck by how many of new 3D films are coming out when I caught Despicable Me last week - then I saw this New York Times article.&nbsp; What do other people think?&nbsp; Too many 3D films coming out?&nbsp; Not enough?&nbsp; (What&#039;s next?&nbsp; a 3-D Merchant Ivory Period Piece?)<br /><br />http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/03/business/media/03-3d.html?_r=1&amp;ref=movies <br /><br />

				Yes to the Period 3D. Yes too many 3D. I like the article noting how many do not plan to film in 3D, and hopefully the Hobbit(s) will be familiar.<br /><br />&nbsp;:|<br /><br />However, I was surprised how much a kick the U2 in 3D concert film was. Wonderfully surprising.<br />On rare occasions, it might be done well.

				I have to admit, I liked Avatar in 3D and Depsicable Me was fun too.&nbsp; I don&#039;t really get this 3D craze though.

				I&#039;m getting tired of the 3D craze myself.&nbsp; The only times I&#039;ve thought it&#039;s added something to the film was with Avatar and How to Train Your Dragon (because there are a lot of flying scenes so it&#039;s like a ride).&nbsp; I think it&#039;s a fad and a way for Hollywood to make money.&nbsp; They charge so much extra to see these films and now tickets are $20.&nbsp; It&#039;s crazy.&nbsp; No wonder no one goes to the movies anymore.&nbsp; A family could easily spend $100 seeing a 3D film.&nbsp; With films costing so much now, I weigh whether or not the film is worth going to the theater for or just waiting for the DVD to hit Netflix.&nbsp; And with rude patrons at most theaters, it makes it even worse.&nbsp; I&#039;d rather just watch my netflix from the comfort of my own home.<br /><br />My other gripe - how Hollywood is successfully ruining every childhood 2D cartoon by making it a 3D film (whether or not it&#039;s for 3D glasses or just 3D computer generated as opposed to 2D hand-drawn).&nbsp; They&#039;ve ruined Scooby, Smurfs, Garfield, Chipmunks, and now Yogi Bear.&nbsp; And the characters are butt ugly.&nbsp; They were so much better hand-drawn.&nbsp; I&#039;m not opposed to 3D movies but at least have an original idea.&nbsp; And don&#039;t make butt ugly characters.&nbsp;

				<br />I am curious about the reports of a Gravity film. And trust the filmmaker may take 3D with a little more artistic care.
