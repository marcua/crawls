				Healthcare should not be profit based business. Health insurance and pharmaceutical companies are making huge profits, while so many people struggle or can&#039;t afford medical procedures or necessary medicines. I recall about 4 years ago my mother&#039;s doctor prescribed her an antibiotic for an infection, it cost $265.00, and she couldn&#039;t afford it. I paid it for her so she can get better. My uncle needs to have a couple of surguries, but medicare alone doesn&#039;t cover it. Alot of people, especially those with no insurance or limited insurance have to choose between food or medicine. Alot of things in the USA are a priviledge.&#160; Decent healthcare should be a right, and not a priviledge.

I distrust &#039;change&#039; folks like those who usually advocate&nbsp; single payer, they usually advocate other things&nbsp; I also don&#039;t agree. If you bothered&nbsp; reading my post, I talk about how costs can be lowered, and single payer&nbsp; is not one of them. I was in the hospital&nbsp; too, with NO health insurance. I have run into many people&nbsp; from Italy, Spain and as&nbsp; far away as Indonesia, who come here cause&nbsp; they can&#039;t get the same level of care, no matter what they pay. I also have relatives, still in Europe, what&#039;s&nbsp; left of them, and they tell me about the fine &#039;single payer&#039; and Govt run system. It&#039;s not the solution. You don&#039;t abolish the entire&nbsp; health care system of private insurance&nbsp; for over&nbsp; 150 million for&nbsp; an estimated 45 million, 1/3 of whom are estimated&nbsp; to be here illegally. We already pay more&nbsp; than any industrialised&nbsp; nation and health care costs&nbsp; more than the Military, and most other&nbsp; social programs combined. This issue interests me quite a bit and I have learned alot.

				The question I have is this: why are we paying the most of any nation in the industrialized world? there must be something wrong there. And I do believe that a single-payer system is the answer. Also to say that out of 45 million uninsured people ( I am one of them) that a third are illegals is again incorrect. The 47 million, which is actually the correct number, are all citizens. It does not take into account illegals. Occasionally people will come here from other countries for certain procedures. I highly doubt that you can say that Indonesia has the same healthcare status as Italy. I know for a fact that the Italian healthcare system, while far from perfect, is a far better system than we have here today. The problem seems to be in the distrust for the government to run the healthcare. I will give you an example. When I first went to Italy in 1999, I spent six months there, with no travelers insurance, mainly because I didn&#039;t know how long I would be there for. In any event, at one point I developed a toothache, which I found out later was an abcess. Painful as all hell. My girlfriend at the time (now my wife) suggested that we go to a local hospital to have it looked at. I was skeptical, knowing how much dental work costs in this country. End result was that I had to have the tooth pulled. It cost me all of 50,000 Lire ( this was pre-euro) which is equal to $25. Twenty-five freaking dollars to have a tooth pulled!! And I was a tourist!!! No insurance at all! Even Israel has a better run, more affordable healthcare system than we do!! No one is uninsured there. Or in Italy. Or in Germany. Or in the U.K. Why? Because it is mandatory. You either have government healthcare or private healthcare. The government healthcare is cheaper for sure. But EVERYONE has coverage. The government healthcare comes directly from your taxes. Private healthcare, if you so choose, and in Italy and Germany it is usually those who make A LOT of money who get it, just guarantees faster appointments, and less wait times at hospitals and doctors offices. But the care is the same.

				Wow, I didn&#039;t expect this thread to pick up. The rally was good, I mean it was really small (only about 100 people or so), but it grew to about 150 or 200 by the end I think. Ralph Nader showed up which was kinda cool, I haven&#039;t ever seen him in person. Haven&#039;t voted for him and don&#039;t consider myself a Nader fan but he came by just for a couple minutes..<br /><br />I agree also that there are certain things in the public interest that should be &quot;socialized&quot;. Public transit, roads, education, police, fire, military, FAA, NASA, etc. Basically, if your neighbors house burns down you hope the firemen will come and put it out before it spreads to your house, it&#039;s in our own interest that the firemen take care of the neighbors house when it burns down. Likewise, I think health is the same way. We&#039;ve got more than 1/3 of our country with no insurance, and I think it&#039;s dangerous for everyone to have that many people (especially kids) without regular access to a doctor. I don&#039;t feel this way about all services mind you, and most of the &quot;market&quot; should remain free. However, there are some basic necessities that I think do well socialized and we have lots of good examples of that around us.<br /><br />I think there&#039;s a way to allow people to have their own insurance if they want, but I think there should be basic health coverage available to all Americans who want it rich or poor. As the wealthiest nation on earth I think we can afford it.

				Want people want plain and simple is more affordable health care.&nbsp; I do not think that govt stepping in to broker a better deal for it&#039;s citizens would be govt taking over the health care system at all. That is just a scare and fear tactic of some politicians and the health care industry / lobbyists.&nbsp; I mean, they didn&#039;t mind when Bush stepped in to broker a so called better deal on meds for senior citizens did they?&nbsp; No they loved it cause it made them billions in profit.&nbsp; We how about govt stepping in to broker a deal on health care but in a way that works for all? <br /><br />A plan that I suggest would be for govt to broker the following deal:<br /><br />Level 1.&nbsp; A single pay plan per person<br />1 Provides all preventative care such as physicals, check ups, testing, dental cleanings and similar, basic eye care and eye wear.<br />2. Emergency surgery, Non elective surgery.<br />3. Care for life threatening issues such as cancer, diabetes, etc...<br /><br />Level 2. Private health care using a system based on what we have today in terms of premium coverage. <br />1. You can choose your doctor, get elective surgery, any surgery<br />2. For those who can and want a higher level of care.<br /><br />So that&#039;s a basic rate for level one brokered by the govt and tiered packages for level two. The govt does not take over anything. Really.&nbsp; <br /><br />And if that doesn&#039;t work than how about the plan politicians get? If it&#039;s good enough for the politicians it should be good enough for you and me.<br /><br />Anyone wishing to discuss this, please keep it in the realm of: Better health care for all Americans, No bashing other countries to prove a point, No bashing of any type.<br />

And I do believe that a single-payer system is the answer. Also to say that out of 45 million uninsured people ( I am one of them) that a third are illegals is again incorrect. The 47 million, which is actually the correct number, are all citizens. It does not take into account illegals. Occasionally people will come here from other countries for certain procedures. I highly doubt that you can say that Indonesia has the same healthcare status as Italy. I know for a fact that the Italian healthcare system, while far from perfect, is a far better system than we have here today. The problem seems to be in the distrust for the government to run the healthcare. I will give you an example. When I first went to Italy in 1999, I spent six months there, with no travelers insurance, mainly because I didn&#039;t know how long I would be there for. In any event, at one point I developed a toothache, which I found out later was an abcess. Painful as all hell. My girlfriend at the time (now my wife) suggested that we go to a local hospital to have it looked at. I was skeptical, knowing how much dental work costs in this country. End result was that I had to have the tooth pulled. It cost me all of 50,000 Lire ( this was pre-euro) which is equal to $25. Twenty-five freaking dollars to have a tooth pulled!! And I was a tourist!!! No insurance at all! Even Israel has a better run, more affordable healthcare system than we do!! No one is uninsured there. Or in Italy. Or in Germany. Or in the U.K. Why? Because it is mandatory. You either have government healthcare or private healthcare. The government healthcare is cheaper for sure. But EVERYONE has coverage. The government healthcare comes directly from your taxes. Private healthcare, if you so choose, and in Italy and Germany it is usually those who make A LOT of money who get it, just guarantees faster appointments, and less wait times at hospitals and doctors offices. But the care is the same. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />First, those&nbsp; are estimates, and they are based on people&nbsp; leaving jobs, no &#039;portability&#039; of insurance and children, who receive care, most times, from family employment. You have&nbsp; a van parked&nbsp; most days&nbsp; outside&nbsp; of&nbsp; the EL on Ditmars &#039;Family Health Plus&#039;&nbsp; forn people&nbsp; to sign up. The state&nbsp; &#039;fraud&#039; is&nbsp; enormous, nationwide&nbsp; it&#039;s criminal. They&nbsp; do include&nbsp; the &#039;estimated&#039; illegal&nbsp; population. <br /><br />You have more&nbsp; than occasionaly coming here, and they come here cause&nbsp; procedures are unavailable in those&nbsp; nations. There&nbsp; are tens of thousands every year who come here and are treated for &#039;free&#039; But, there is no free in life, someone&nbsp; has to pay. I&#039;m sure&nbsp; you were&nbsp; charged&nbsp; almost nothing as a tourist&nbsp; in Italy, but, you also&nbsp; don&#039;t pay&nbsp; the same taxes&nbsp; or live&nbsp; at the level of the typical&nbsp; working man. The US&nbsp; prides intself on individualism, at least it used&nbsp; too, now that includes&nbsp; taking care of yourself&nbsp; on most levels.

Once, I had that info, income, health, unemployment. I would then give them opitions, based&nbsp; on that information. This would&nbsp; cover everyone, who is unable&nbsp; to pay now, not just based on need, but, ability&nbsp; to pay. Further, I would&nbsp; expand the &#039;free&#039;&nbsp; care&nbsp; doctors&nbsp; are supposed&nbsp; to give, and hospitals. This after negotiating with&nbsp; Unions&nbsp; and Health Care&nbsp; workers, exchanging reductions&nbsp; in certain benefits now, for a lump sum, based&nbsp; on performance&nbsp; in these clinics set up for the truly destitute. In five years, I would re-evaluate, and change&nbsp; what is not working, by sending out 50, 100 Million questionares. Further, I would initiate&nbsp; health fitness, prevention programs in schools. The best way to lower&nbsp; health costs, is to get&nbsp; healthy kids off their&nbsp; you know what, and away from junk food, and if we are all paying into this pool for&nbsp; the truly needed, then they will have to do their&nbsp; part, since&nbsp; this is a system based on capital, if it were a system based&nbsp; on &#039;socialised&#039; medicine, it would be regimentated from food&nbsp; to housing, that&#039;s&nbsp; how they keep costs&nbsp; down in that one. I don&#039;t&nbsp; want that for adults in our nation.These would only be the first steps, with many people&nbsp; coming in and out of the &#039;state&#039; system, depending on all these&nbsp; factors.

I mean I grew&nbsp; up at a time where&nbsp; smoking, many things,was a&nbsp; right of passage as was, drinking, and listening to Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and Pink Floyd. :lol:I damaged&nbsp; my health, and have been &#039;repairing&#039; it for&nbsp; years. I won&#039;t say what, but, I succesfully&nbsp; fought off&nbsp; one&nbsp; of the dreaded&nbsp; killers. I used a combined&nbsp; traditional Western and more&nbsp; &#039;non-tradtional&#039; Eastern medicine. I&#039;m a firm believer&nbsp; in natural therapies, &#039;Pro-Biotics&#039;, Skilled Relaxation, etc..<br /><br />The reason I say you would have to look at other costs,that is if one heads down a &#039;socialised&#039;&nbsp; road of medicine, it has a domino effect&nbsp; on other costs. This is why nations with Universal health care, like Cuba, former Soviet, tried to control costs by &#039;nationalising&#039; everything, doesn&#039;t work. The more &#039;moderate&#039;, Euro version, also is facing problems&nbsp; now, cause the Euro is producing great wealth, 500 Million population market, but, it can&#039;t sustain the &#039;socialised&#039;&nbsp; health care for &#039;all&#039;, without cuts in benefits. Any way you slice it, someone will &#039;pay.&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />This is&nbsp; why&nbsp; my solution would combine&nbsp; public and private, the only similar program I see&nbsp; is McCains, from the candidates, and he has had his share&nbsp; of health problems, like me, so he understands. http://www.ontheissues.org/2008/John_McCain_Health_Care.htm&nbsp; I have corresponded&nbsp; with him on it. The one avenue every being is concerned with is their health.&nbsp;
