			Minutes from Meeting at Tara’s house, September 30th, 2005<br /><br />Notes from the meeting. &nbsp;Let’s find a place for distribution! &nbsp; Not to sound like a pessimist, but Finding a distribution spot is usually one of the hardest things about starting a CSA. &nbsp;<br />Needs: nearness to Public Transportation, ease of unloading, parking for Bill’s truck, visibility, ease of clean-up, hosted somewhere with the same sort of goals, storage, evening hours and perhaps use at other times, indoor vs. outdoor… these are all important to think about in looking for a new place. &nbsp;Also, we’ll have to run it past Bill in the end.<br />4 Churches: Greek Church @ 30th Drive and 31st St., Korean Church, Spanish Episcopal, Methodist.—some of these may have an infrastructure for accepting left over food. &nbsp;Appeal to them on that note, too. &nbsp;Also, we have a CSA distribution out of a church and that pastor would be willing to talk to another… (church of the Heavenly Rest)<br />Schools: Elementary off of 30th – Thoreau- LIC high school. &nbsp;Ask 2 members who have connections there. &nbsp;Perhaps we can offer a free share to the principal (or the pastor in the case of a church). &nbsp;Ask at any or all schools that are located near transportation?<br />Community Centers<br />Catholic Charities might be a good idea, but also they seem to be closing quickly.<br />The YMCA at 30th Drive and 21st st. is not the most convenient, but it would not be bad to think of this option. <br />&nbsp;Also, feel free to think about private organizations. Social clubs, Rotary Clubs, &nbsp;fitness centers.<br />We can look at getting some small grants for things like tables, chairs, tents. &nbsp;There will be a fundraising workshop at Just Food on the 17th of October (Monday). &nbsp;Cara will not be able to attend, but hopes some members will be able to go.<br />Post the need on LICNYC, Astorians (!) and My Astoria about the need for a new place<br />Go to LICBDC <br />We discussed dividing these by subway stations… meaning that people who lived around one station would approach business, organizations and clubs that might fit the profile of what we want from a distribution site. &nbsp;<br /><br />Bank Accounts- We also briefly discussed bank accounts and EIN numbers. &nbsp;It would be ideal to have our own bank account. &nbsp;Paula informed us that in order to get the bank account, we’d need and EIN and by-laws and probably to talk to Washington Mutual. &nbsp;Paula says that… 1) Just Food is working on getting a relationship with someone higher on the chain of command than a bank manager to understand the CSA program and give it a stamp of approval 2) Just Food has a set of generic by-laws that we’d be able to plug our names into. &nbsp;(As of the following Monday, we have an EIN #)<br /><br />We also need to think about “Goals”. &nbsp;People should think about what they think is important about the CSA and how we could work to highlight those issues, which could easily be worked into a mission statement. &nbsp;For example, Tara thinks it is important that the CSA is still accessible to low income families. &nbsp;Someone else might see the environmental side as very important. &nbsp;(We can also fundraise to make lower-income shares or educational pieces a bit easier.)

(Our CSA requires that members volunteer throughout the season to assist the site coordinator. &nbsp;It is possible for member volunteers to run distribution without the oversight of a coordinator who is there every week. &nbsp;For this scheme to be successful, in-depth instructions must be available to the volunteers when they arrive for their shifts. &nbsp;See an example of these instructions in CSA Toolkit Sample Materials. &nbsp;Queens CSA has a separate distribution manager and Human resource manager, the first overseeing the distribution and the other the volunteers. &nbsp;This would be easier, but only if two people wanted the jobs.)<br />1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oversees distribution of vegetables every week, including meeting the farmer, working with the owners/managers of the distribution site and cleaning up the site.<br />2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oversees the weekly volunteers.<br />3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recruits for core group.<br />4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talks to members at the site to hear their concerns<br />5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serves as the site contact for the owners of the distribution site.<br /><br />Treasurer &amp; Records Keeper (3-4 hours a month during enrollment period, less at other times)<br />1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collects and keeps track of checks and membership information; pays the farmer.<br />2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Computer and database skills needed (Quicken/Quickbooks/Excel); must be very organized.<br />3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keeps electronic copies of newsletters, sharelogs and photos of the share.<br />4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Researches purchases<br />5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Performs surveys and complies results.<br /><br />Media Coordinator (This could be one job when combined with the Outreach Coordinator. &nbsp;For the next year, two separate jobs might be best as there will be a fair amount of outreach to be done.)<br />1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recruits members via media and online resources.<br />2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contacts and deals with media- calls from newspapers<br />3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responds promptly to email inquiries<br />4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sends electronic mailings<br />5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintains webpage, ideally keeping newsletters, pictures of the shares and news and events up to date each week<br /><br />Outreach Coordinator<br />1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recruits members via telephone and written materials, including flyering, tabling at events, speaking at meetings. &nbsp;<br />2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answers phone queries<br />3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sends mailings and written press releases<br />4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distributes specific outreach volunteering possibilities to other members

			i'm sorry that i have been unable to make it to these meetings. i'm quite interested in having a share of this CSA in the coming season.<br /><br />i have a minor suggestion/comment.<br /><br />i work fulltime. it does not allow me to leave the job in the middle of the day, especially since i work i manhattan and would have to come back to astoria.<br /><br />would the CSA be able to function on &nbsp;a Saturday/Sunday?<br />i feel like i would definitely be able to pick up my share, or other people's shares more often if it was put on that day. also, i would be able to volunteer more frequently if it were on those days. <br /><br />if it were put on either of those days, i would not have a problem with the original location. :)

			Your suggestion is not a minor one, but a common issue most of us have. <br /><br />I believe the day of the distribution has more to do with when the farmer is available. &nbsp;He drops off to a couple other CSA's in the area and I don't think he would want to make more than one trip in the week (can you imagine the cost of gas from the South Fork to here and back twice in a week?)<br /><br />The time of the distribution has to do with our location and how long they (the managers of that location) allow us to say there. &nbsp;Because our CSA uses tables from the senior center and they don't stay open late a night, we can only be there so long.<br /><br />Perhaps when looking for a new distribution site one of our conditions could be to have a later pick up time. &nbsp;But we would have to find a site (church, club, etc) that wouldn't mind us distributing until whenever? &nbsp;Also, who would be willing (among us) to run the site until dark? &nbsp;<br /><br />This is one a several really important issues we all need to talk about and it is important to have concerned interested members show up to meetings. &nbsp;Typing on a website is one thing, but showing an active participation in the CSA is another. &nbsp;Out of 9 RSVP's to the last meeting only one showed...and I don't want to make a decision about the group that other people don't support, just because they are not there to voice their opinions. &nbsp;Nor do I think that anyone should speak on behalf a group of people. &nbsp;This defeats a big purpose of the CSA-community involvement.<br /><br />I've opened up my house to Cara and the CSA for another get-together (pot luck dinner this time) and a couple of dates will be thrown out, in the near future, to the members to decide when they would like to have it. &nbsp;Please also consider a time of the night as well as date, so we may maximize the number of availble members. &nbsp;Also if location is a concern, if there is anyone who can host a party or a meeting in an area that's more accessible to people that would be great too.<br /><br />Tara

			very well put, AstoriaK. &nbsp;<br /><br />Tuesday is the day that Bill, our farmer, comes to the city. &nbsp;Out of the almost 40 CSA sites in the city, I only know of two that distribute on Saturdays (Williamsburg and Red Hook). &nbsp;They both have distributions during Farmer's Markets... some of the people like it, but I have heard lots of complaints, too. &nbsp;If you tend to go away on weekends or find that you have busy weekends, Saturday is just as difficult. &nbsp;I'd be interested in hearing from the current members how they feel about the day... that's covered in a survey we're doing currently and I'll get back to everyone about the results. <br /><br />The bigger issue, as AstoriaK mentioned, is having a later distribution on Tuesdays. &nbsp;That seems like the best way to make distribution more convenient while keeping our farmer (and he's great, but isn't interested in changing days). &nbsp; Right now we close around 7 but wanted to stay open until 7:30... I know this is tough for one of our members, but I haven't really heard complaints from anyone else. &nbsp; 7:30 made sense to me because if you get out of work at 6:45, you can back at Ravenswood by &nbsp;7:30. &nbsp;Certainly, a distribution site closer to the subway would make this a bit easier.<br /><br />Any suggestions about a distribution site?
