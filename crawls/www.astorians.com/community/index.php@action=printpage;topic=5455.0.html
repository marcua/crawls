				This is a fantastic resource - thanks for providing it. <br /><br />Just looked up Wave Thai - I am surprised to see that it says that a &quot;food protection certificate not held by supervisor of food operations.&quot; Isn&#039;t that a major requirement for a restaurant to even be approved to open for business? Also saw that there is evidence of mice there, but I&#039;m hardly surprised since NYC is infested with them no matter where you go.

				This site has its good points and its bad points. Its great being able to look up restaurant and know what type of violations they have. However, it is quite upsetting at the same time! Three of my favorite restaurants are pretty high up there- 24 &amp; 25&#039;s. This being said, some of the violations are kind of silly. There is one that mentions something to the effect of improper lighting. While that isn&#039;t a good thing- I certainly don&#039;t think it is the worst thing in the world. The mice and bugs and food not being stored at proper temperatures- now that REALLY freaks me out. Humm. Not sure if I want to look anything else up - I might never eat dinner out again.

				It&#039;s interesting how there seems to be no correlation between the general skeeviness of a place and its inspection score..<br />Restaurants that seem gross on the surface have 2 points,&nbsp; :-o , like the McDonald&#039;s in the concourse of my building. <br />Judging by the staff there, you&#039;re lucky not to be poisoned.&nbsp; Meanwhile clean-looking, upscale places have high scores.<br />

				You read my mind Tuesday. That is what freaked me out so much about this website. I am not going to name names, but some of my favorite restaurants, ones that I have patronized for years, have gotten poor ratings while other places that look filthy got decent rating. Go figure. <br /><br />I really almost wish I never looked here- now I don&#039;t know if I can eat at those places anymore.

				I&#039;ll agree with tuesday as well, however that&#039;s really the risk you take by going out to eat, or for that matter, buying anything that has been processed in a factory. We really do put a lot of trust in total strangers, whether it is at a restaurant, grocery store, or factory, for what we put into our bodies. <br /><br />Most restaurants don&#039;t want to shut down. It is very very costly to open, own, and operate a restaurant, so it is in their best interest to keep violations down as much as possible. I think that many restaurants are in a constant struggle with the rat infestation, and they are bound to have evidence of that no matter what because this is a city with very old or poorly made buildings. They also run risks by who they hire and many restaurants likely have high turnover for jobs that focus on cleaning (dishwasher, mopping, etc., etc.). So there is always a challenge to keep the balance and make sure that ultimately the consumer is happy and/or the inspectors happy.<br /><br />Sadly some of my favorite restaurants have also received terrible scores, but to be honest, I&#039;ll likely go back to them. The food is good, the staff are pleasant and accomodating, and the atmosphere is nice. If I see something that has me worried as a patron, then I might be less likely to return, but so far in the years that I&#039;ve frequented these restaurants I haven&#039;t had any real negative experience...that I know of. :roll:

				Practically every restaurant I&#039;ve worked at has some kind of violation. Most having to do with mice/insects. It&#039;s something you just can&#039;t really avoid. They&#039;ll have exterminators and do as much as they can to combat this problem, but its NYC. Like wasabisam said, sometimes you&#039;re unlucky enough to have your restaurant that&#039;s in a building that has rodent/insect problems. And theres really very little you can do to correct it on a permanent basis.<br /><br />As someone who works in a kitchen, I can assure you though, we try to be as sanitary as possible, and that we&#039;re not cuddling the mice and having them play with your food. It&#039;s not like we WANT to get you sick.

				I think the chains do better because most have very well-developed cleanliness plans and operating procedures.&nbsp; Of course, the weakness is how the implement actually in the store...
