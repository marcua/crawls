				A girl came skipping home from school one day. &quot;Mommy, Mommy,&quot; she yelled, &quot;we were counting today, and all the other kids could only count to four, but I counted to 10. See? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,7, 8, 9, 10!&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Very good,&quot; said her mother. <br /><br />&quot;Is it because I&#039;m blonde, Mommy?&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Yes, it&#039;s because you&#039;re blonde,&quot; her mother replied. <br /><br />The next day, the girl came skipping home from school. &quot;Mommy, Mommy,&quot; she yelled, &quot;we were saying the alphabet today, and all the other kids could only say it to D, but I said it to G. See? A, B, C, D, E, F, G!&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Very good,&quot; said her mother. <br /><br />&quot;Is it because I&#039;m blonde, Mommy?&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Yes, pumpkin, it&#039;s because you&#039;re blonde.&quot; <br /><br />The next day the girl came skipping home from school. &quot;Mommy, Mommy,&quot; she yelled, &quot;we were in gym class today, and when we showered, all the other girls had flat chests, but I have these!&quot; <br /><br />And she lifted her tank top to reveal a pair of 36Cs. <br /><br />&quot;Very good,&quot; said her embarrassed mother. <br /><br />&quot;Is it because I&#039;m blonde, mommy?&quot; <br /><br />&quot;No, it&#039;s because you&#039;re 25.&quot;

				As much as I think blonde jokes are funny, I think it&#039;s kinda weird that they&#039;re acceptable but racial jokes aren&#039;t. I mean, blonde jokes are making fun of a stereotype that assumes something negative about a group of people that isn&#039;t actually related to what makes the group a group, amiright?

				Gee paratactical, do you have to be such a kill-joy?

				OK Nycmacuser...some of those made me laugh so hard I cried.<br /><br />Para, here&#039;s one for you (even though you&#039;re not a blonde...)<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Smart Blonde</span><br /><br />A blonde and a lawyer are seated next to each other on a flight from LA to NY. The lawyer asks if she would like to play a fun game? The blonde, tired, just wants to take a nap, politely declines and rolls over to the window to catch a few winks. <br /><br />The lawyer persists and explains that the game is easy and a lot of fun. He explains, &quot;I ask you a question, and if you don&#039;t know the answer, you pay me $5.00, and vise versa.&quot; <br /><br />Again, she declines and tries to get some sleep. <br /><br />The lawyer, now agitated, says, &quot;Okay, if you don&#039;t know the answer you pay me $5.00, and if I don&#039;t know the answer, I will pay you $500.00.&quot; <br /><br />This catches the blonde&#039;s attention and, figuring there will be no end to this torment unless she plays, agrees to the game. <br /><br />The lawyer asks the first question. &quot;What&#039;s the distance from the earth to the moon?&quot; <br /><br />The blonde doesn&#039;t say a word, reaches into her purse, pulls out a $5.00 bill and hands it to the lawyer. &quot;Okay, &quot; says the lawyer, &quot;your turn&quot;. <br /><br />She asks the lawyer, &quot;What goes up a hill with three legs and comes down with four legs?&quot; <br /><br />The lawyer, puzzled, takes out his laptop computer and searches all his references, no answer. He taps into the air phone with his modem and searches the net and the library of congress, no answer. Frustrated, he sends e-mail to all his friends and coworkers, to no avail. After an hour, he wakes the blonde, and hands her $500.00. <br /><br />The blonde says, &quot;Thank you, &quot; and turns back to get some more sleep. <br /><br />The lawyer, who is more than a little miffed, wakes the blonde and asks, &quot;Well, what&#039;s the answer?&quot; <br /><br />Without a word, the blonde reaches into her purse, hands the lawyer $5.00, and goes back to sleep.

				A man and a friend are playing golf one day at their local golf course. One of the guys is about to chip onto the green when he sees a long funeral procession on the road next to the course. He stops in mid-swing, takes off his golf cap, closes his eyes, and bows down in prayer. <br /><br />His friend says: “Wow, that is the most thoughtful and touching thing I have ever seen. You truly are a kind man.” <br /><br />The man then replies: “Yeah, well we were married 35 years.”<br />

				Paddy had been drinking at his local Dublin pub all day and most of the night celebrating St Patrick&#039;s Day. <br />Mick, the bartender says, &#039;You&#039;ll not be drinking anymore tonight, Paddy. <br />Paddy replies, &#039;OK Mick, I&#039;ll be on my way then. Paddy spins around on his stool and steps off. He falls flat on his face. <br />&#039;Shoite&#039; he says and pulls himself up by the stool and dusts himself off. He takes a step towards the door and falls flat on his face,<br /><br />&#039;Shoite,<br /><br />Shoite !&#039;<br /><br /><br />He looks to the doorway and thinks to himself that if he can just get to the door and some fresh air he&#039;ll be fine. <br />He belly crawls to the door and shimmies up to the door frame. <br />He sticks his head outside and takes a deep breath of fresh air, feels much better and takes a step out onto the sidewalk and falls flat on his face.<br /><br /><br />&#039;Bi&#039;Jesus.... I&#039;m fockin&#039; focked,&#039; he says.<br /><br /><br />He can see his house just a few doors down, and crawls to the door, hauls himself up the door frame, opens the door and shimmies inside. <br />He takes a look up the stairs and says &#039;No fockin&#039; way&#039;. He crawls up the stairs to his bedroom door and says &#039;I can make it to the bed&#039;. <br />He takes a step into the room and falls flat on his face. He says &#039;Fock it&#039; and falls into bed.<br /><br /><br />The next morning, his wife, Jess, comes into the room carrying a cup of coffee and says,<br />&nbsp;&#039;Get up Paddy. Did you have a bit to drink last night ?&#039;<br /><br /><br />Paddy says, &#039;I did, Jess. I was fockin&#039; pissed.

I would sleep with him in a heartbeat, are you nuts?&#039; <br /><br />&nbsp; The boy then went to his brother and asked, &#039;Would you sleep&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; with Brad Pitt for&nbsp; a million dollars?&#039; &#039;Of course,&#039; the brother replied.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &#039;Do you know how much a&nbsp; million bucks would buy?&#039;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; The boy pondered the answers for a few days and then went back&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; to his dad.&nbsp; His father asked him, &#039;Did you find out the difference&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; between potentially and&nbsp; realistically?&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; The boy replied, &#039;Yes.

				A young man named John received a parrot as an early Christmas gift.<br />&nbsp;<br />But the parrot had a bad attitude and an even worse vocabulary. Every word out of the bird&#039;s mouth was rude, obnoxious and laced with profanity. John tried and tried to change the bird&#039;s attitude by consistently saying only polite words, playing soft music and anything else he could think of to &#039;clean up&#039; the bird&#039;s vocabulary. <br /><br />Finally, John was fed up and he yelled at the parrot. The parrot yelled back. John shook the parrot and the parrot got angrier and even ruder. <br /><br />John, in desperation, threw up his hands, grabbed the bird and shoved him in the freezer.&nbsp; For a few minutes the parrot squawked and kicked and screamed.&nbsp; Then suddenly there was total quiet.&nbsp; Not a peep was heard for over a minute. <br /><br />Fearing that he&#039;d hurt the parrot, John quickly opened the door to the freezer. The parrot calmly stepped out onto John&#039;s outstretched arms and said &#039;I believe I may have offended you with my rude language and actions.&nbsp; I&#039;m sincerely remorseful for my inappropriate transgressions and I fully intend to do everything I can to correct my rude and unforgivable behavior.&#039;<br /><br />John was stunned at the change in the bird&#039;s attitude. As he was about to ask the parrot what had made such a dramatic change in his behavior, the bird continued...<br /><br />...&#039;May I enquire as to what the turkey did?&#039; <br />

				Two women had been having a friendly lunch when the subject turned<br />to sex. &quot;You know, John and I have been having some sexual problems,&quot;<br />Linda told her friend. &quot;That&#039;s amazing!&quot; Mary replied, &quot;So have Tom and<br />I. We&#039;re thinking&nbsp;of going to a sex therapist,&quot; said Linda. &quot;Oh, we<br />could never do that!&nbsp;We&#039;d be too embarrassed!,&quot; responded Mary. &quot;But<br />after you go, will you&nbsp; please tell me how it went?&quot;<br /><br />Several weeks passed, and the two friends met for lunch again.<br />&quot;So how did the sex therapy work out, Linda?&quot; Mary asked. &quot;Things<br />couldn&#039;t be better!,&quot; Linda exclaimed. &quot;We began with a physical<br />exam, and afterward the doctor said he was certain he could help us.<br />He told us to stop at the grocery store on the way home and buy a bunch<br />of grapes and a dozen donuts.&nbsp;He told us to sit on the floor nude,<br />and toss the grapes and donuts at each other.&nbsp;Every grape that went<br />into my vagina, John had to get it out with his tongue. Every donut<br />that I ringed his penis with, I had to eat.&nbsp;Our sex life is wonderful,<br />in fact it&#039;s better than it&#039;s ever been!&quot;<br /><br />With that endorsement Mary talked her husband into an appointment<br />with the same sex therapist. After the physical exams were<br />completed the doctor called Mary and Tom into his office. &quot;I&#039;m<br />afraid&nbsp; there is nothing I can do for you,&quot; he said. &quot;But doctor,&quot; Mary<br />complained, &quot;you did such good for Linda and John, surely you must<br />have a suggestion for us!&nbsp;Please, please, can&#039;t you give us some<br />help?&nbsp;Any help at all?&quot; &quot;Well, OK,&quot; the doctor answered. &quot;On your way<br />home,&nbsp; I want you to stop at the grocery store and buy a sack of apples<br />and&nbsp; a box of cheerios . . .&quot;

				This beautiful woman one day walks into a doctors office and the doctor is bowled over by how stunningly awesome she is. All his professionalism goes right out the window... <br /><br />He tells her to take her pants off, she does, and he starts rubbing her thighs. <br /><br />&quot;Do you know what I am doing?&quot; asks the doctor? <br /><br />&quot;Yes, checking for abnormalities.&quot; she replies. <br /><br />He tells her to take off her shirt and bra, she takes them off. The doctor begins rubbing her breasts and asks, &quot;Do you know what I am doing now?&quot;, she replies, &quot;Yes, checking for cancer.&quot; <br /><br />Finally, he tells her to take off her panties, lays her on the table, gets on top of her and starts having sex with her. He says to her, &quot;Do you know what I am doing now?&quot; <br /><br />She replies, &quot;Yes, getting herpies - that&#039;s why I am here!&quot;

When the turbulence<br />finally abated, the flight attendants unbuckled themselves, and the<br />captain&#039;s voice came on over the intercom. <br /><br />&quot;Well, folks, that was quite some ride, wasn&#039;t it?&#039; But we came through it<br />fine, just the way we always do, and I&#039;m happy to report that it looks like<br />the remainder of our trip should be much calmer.

				A rabbit one day managed to break free from the laboratory where he had been born and brought up. As he scurried away from the fencing of the compound, he felt grass under his little feet and saw the dawn breaking for the first time in his life. &quot;Wow, this is great,&quot; he thought. It wasn&#039;t long before he came to a hedge and, after squeezing under it he saw a wonderful sight: lots of other bunny rabbits, all free, having fun and nibbling at the lush grass.<br /><br />Hey,&quot; he called. &quot;I&#039;m a rabbit from the laboratory and I&#039;ve just escaped. Are you wild rabbits?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Yes. Come and join us,&quot; they cried. Our friend hopped over to them and started eating the grass. It tasted so good, unlike his tasteless food he grew up with. &quot;What else do you wild rabbits do?&quot; he asked. &quot;Well,&quot; one of them said. &quot;You see that field there? It&#039;s got carrots growing in it. We dig them up and eat them.&quot; This he couldn&#039;t resist and he spent the next hour eating the most succulent carrots. They were wonderful. Later, he asked them again, &quot;What else do you do?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;You see that field there? It&#039;s got lettuce growing in it. We eat them as well.&quot; The lettuce tasted just as good and he returned a while later completely full. &quot;Is there anything else you guys do?&quot; he asked. One of the other rabbits came a bit closer to him and spoke softly. &quot;There&#039;s one other thing you must try. You see those rabbits there,&quot; he said, pointing to the far corner of the field. &quot;They&#039;re girls. We shag them. Go and try it.&quot; Well, our friend spent the rest of the morning screwing his little heart out until, completely knackered, he staggered back over to the guys. &quot;That was fantastic,&quot; he panted. &quot;So are you going to live with us then?&quot; one of them asked. &quot;I&#039;m sorry, I had a great time but I can&#039;t.&quot; The wild rabbits all stared at him, a bit surprised. &quot;Why? We thought you liked it here.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I do,&quot; our friend replied. &quot;But I must get back to the laboratory. I&#039;m dying for a cigarette.&quot;

				<br />An elderly husband and wife noticed that they were beginning to forget many little things around the house. They were afraid that this could be dangerous, as one of them may accidentally forget to turn off the stove and thus cause a fire. So, they decided to go see their physician to get some help. <br />Their physician told them that many people their age find it useful to write themselves little notes as reminders. <br /><br />The elderly couple thought this sounded wonderful, and left the doctor&#039;s office very pleased with the advice. When they got home, the wife said, &quot;Dear, will you please go to the kitchen and get me a dish of ice cream? And why don&#039;t you write that down so you won&#039;t forget?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Nonsense,&quot; said the husband, &quot;I can remember a dish of ice cream!&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Well,&quot; said the wife, &quot;I&#039;d also like some strawberries on it. You better write that down, because I know you&#039;ll forget.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Don&#039;t be silly,&quot; replied the husband. &quot;A dish of ice cream and some strawberries. I can remember that!&quot; <br /><br />&quot;OK, dear, but I&#039;d like you to put some whipped cream on top. Now you&#039;d really better write it down now. You&#039;ll forget,&quot; said the wife.<br /><br />&quot;Come now, my memory&#039;s not all that bad,&quot; said the husband. &quot;No problem-- a dish of ice cream with strawberries and whipped cream.&quot; With that, the husband shut the kitchen door behind him. The wife could hear him getting out pots and pans, and making some noise inconsistent with his preparing a dish of ice cream, strawberries, and whipped cream. He emerged from the kitchen about 15 minutes later. Walking over to his wife, he presented her with a plate of bacon and eggs.<br /><br />The wife took one look at the plate, glanced up at her husband and said, &quot;Hey, where&#039;s the toast?&quot; <br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />A couple age 67, went to the doctor&#039;s office. The doctor asked, &quot;What can I do for you?&quot;<br />The man said, &quot;Doctor, Will you watch us have intercourse?&quot; <br />The Doctor looked puzzled but agreed. When the couple finished, the Doctor said &quot;There&#039;s nothing wrong with the way you have intercourse.&quot; And he charged them $10.00.<br />This happened for several weeks in a row. The couple would make an appointment, have intercourse, and then leave. <br />Finally the Doctor asked, &quot;Just exactly what are you trying to find out?&quot;<br />The old man said, &quot;We&#039;re not trying to find out anything. She is married and we can&#039;t go to her house. I&#039;m married and we can&#039;t go to my house. Holiday Inn charges $22.00, the Hilton charges $27.00, we do it here for $10.00 and I get $8.00 back from Medicare for every visit to the Doctor&#039;s office.&quot;<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Three old ladies are sitting in a diner, chatting about various things. One lady says, &quot;You know, I&#039;m getting really forgetful. This morning, I was standing at the top of the stairs, and I couldn&#039;t remember whether I had just come up or was about to go down.&quot; <br />The second lady says, &quot;You think that&#039;s bad? The other day, I was sitting on the edge of my bed, and I couldn&#039;t remember whether I was going to bed or had just woken up!&quot; <br />The third lady smiles smugly. &quot;Well, my memory&#039;s just as good as it&#039;s always been, knock wood.&quot; She raps the table. With a startled look on her face, she asks, &quot;Who&#039;s there?&quot;<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />A man was walking down the street when he noticed his grandpa sitting on the porch, in the rocking chair, with nothing on from the waist down. &quot;Grandpa, what are you doing?&quot; he exclaimed. The old man looked off in the distance and did not answer him. &quot;Grandpa, what are you doing sitting out here with no pants on?&quot; he asked again.<br />The old man slyly looked at him and said, &quot;Well last week I sat out here with no shirt on, and I got a stiff neck. This was your Grandma&#039;s idea!!&quot;<br />

				Edna and Bill were two residents of a nursing home who had been carrying<br />on a love affair. They were both 96 years old and wheelchair bound.<br /><br />Every night, they would meet in the TV room. Edna would passively hold<br />Bill&#039;s penis, and they would watch TV for an hour or so. It&nbsp; wasn&#039;t much,<br />but it was all they had.<br /><br />One night Bill didn&#039;t show up. He didn&#039;t show up for the next two nights<br />either. Edna assumed he was dead, but then she saw him happily&nbsp; wheeling<br />about the grounds. She confronted him and said, &quot;Where were you these<br />past couple of&nbsp; nights?&quot;<br /><br />He replied, &quot;If you must know, I was with another woman.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Bastard!&quot; she cried. &quot;What were you doing?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;We do the exact same thing that you and I do,&quot; he replied.<br /><br />&quot;Is she prettier or younger than I am?&quot; she asked.<br /><br />&quot;Nope, she looks the same, and she is 98 years old.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Well then, what does she have that I don&#039;t?&quot; Edna asked.<br /><br />Bill smiled and said,&quot; Parkinson&#039;s disease.&quot;<br /><br /><hr /><br />This gruff Irishman went into a bar and ordered a pint of beer. He was burly and muscular but he had a head the size of an orange!<br /><br />The Bartender looked at him strangely and said&nbsp; &quot;Excuse me for asking, I don&#039;t mean to be rude . . . but how come you have such a little head--the size of a&nbsp; orange?&quot;<br /><br />Well replied the man, &quot;I wasn&#039;t born with such a small head. It kinda happened like this . . .<br /><br />I am a fisherman, and while trawling for fish in the harbor I caught a mermaid in my net. I pulled her on board and she begged me to throw her back into the sea--or she would die.<br /><br />Naturally being a gentleman I agreed and in turn she offered me three wishes.<br /><br />My first wish was to have the latest model fishing trawler with radar echo-finders and the lot.<br /><br />&quot;DONE,&quot; she said and under my feet materialized a top-of-the-line fishing boat fully loaded<br /><br />&quot;Your second wish?&quot; she queried. I replied that I&#039;d love to have a top of the line B.M.W. automobile.<br /><br />&quot;DONE,&quot; she laughed. And on top of the deck of my lovely new boat appeared this fantastic B.M.W.<br /><br />&quot;Now your third an final wish?&quot; she urged. I told her how very beautiful she was and that for my third wish I&#039;d like to make love to her!<br /><br />&quot;Ah!&quot; she sighed, &quot;I&#039;d like that also but unfortunately it&#039;s impossible,&quot; she said. &quot;You see I&#039;m really a fish and we cant make love your way. Can I offer you anything else?&quot;<br /><br />Well, I replied, &quot;If we cant make proper love how about a little head?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;OK&quot; she said.<br /><br />And<br /><br />that&#039;s<br /><br />what<br /><br />happened!<br /><br /><hr /><br /><br />&nbsp;A genie popped out of the lamp and said, &quot;You have<br />&nbsp;three wishes. I will grant whatever you wish for,<br />&nbsp;but remember, your boss gets twice as much as you<br />&nbsp;wish for, so be careful what you wish for.&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp;The man said, &quot;That&#039;s easy! I want a million dollars.&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp;A big pile of cash appeared in front of him. &quot;Now,<br />&nbsp;your boss has two million.<br /><br />&nbsp;The man said, &quot;Never mind! I am happy as long as I<br />&nbsp;have my million. Now, I want a Mercedes.&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp;A red Mercedes appeared in front of him and the genie<br />&nbsp;said, &quot;Now, your boss has two of these.&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp;The man was happier than ever.&nbsp; He thought about his<br />&nbsp;last wish, and said, &quot;You know, I have always wanted<br />&nbsp;to donate a kidney!&quot;

				Queen Elizabeth and Dolly Parton die on the same day and they both go before St. Peter to find out if they&#039;ll be admitted to heaven. Unfortunately, there is only one space left that day, so St. Peter must decide which one gets in.<br /><br />St. Peter asks Dolly if there is some particular reason why she should go to heaven.&nbsp; Dolly takes off her top and says, &quot;Look at these, they are the most perfect ones God ever created and I&#039;m sure it will please Him to be able to see them every day for eternity.&quot;<br /><br />St. Peter thanks Dolly and asks her to step aside.&nbsp;Then he asks Queen Elizabeth the same question. She drops her skirt and panties, takes a bottle of Perrier out of her purse, shakes it up and douches with it. St. Peter says, &quot;Okay, Your Majesty, you may go into Heaven.&quot;<br /><br />Dolly is outraged.&nbsp; She screams, &quot;What was that all about?&nbsp; I show you two of God&#039;s own creations—she performs a disgusting hygiene act—and she gets in and I don&#039;t!&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Sorry, Dolly,&quot; says St. Peter, &quot;but a royal flush beats a pair any day.&quot;<br /><br /><hr /><br />Q:&nbsp; What are a woman&#039;s four favorite animals? <br />A:&nbsp; A mink in the closet, a Jaguar in the garage, a tiger in the bedroom, <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and a jackass who&#039;ll pay for it all!<br /><br /><hr /><br />This past fall semester, at Duke University, there were two sophomores who<br />were taking Organic Chemistry and who did pretty well on all of the quizzes<br />and the midterms and labs, etc., such that going into the final they had a<br />solid &#039;A&#039;. These two friends were so confident going into the final that<br />the weekend before finals week, even though the Chem final was on Monday,<br />they decided to go up to University of Virginia and party with some friends<br />up there. So they did this and had a great time. However, with their<br />hangovers and everything, they overslept all day Sunday and didn&#039;t make it<br />back to Duke until early Monday morning.<br /><br />Rather than taking the final then, what they did was to find Professor<br />Aldric after the final and explain to him why they missed the final. They<br />told him that they went up to UVA for the weekend, and had planned to come<br />back in time to study, but that they had a flat tire on the way back and<br />didn&#039;t have a spare and couldn&#039;t get help for a long time and so were late<br />getting back to campus.<br /><br />Aldric thought this over and then agreed that they could make up the final<br />on the following day. The two guys were elated and relieved. So, they<br />studied that night and went in the next day at the time that Aldric had<br />told them. He placed them in separate rooms and handed each of them a test<br />booklet and told them to begin.<br /><br />They looked at the first problem, which was something simple about free<br />radical formation and was worth 5 points. &quot;Cool&quot; they thought, &quot;this is<br />going to be easy.&quot; They did that problem and then turned the page. They<br />were unprepared, however, for what they saw on the next page.<br /><br />It said:&nbsp; &nbsp;(95 points)&nbsp; Which tire?

				A koala bear was approached by a prostitute. Since he had never been with one before, he was curious and excited.

What about my money?&quot; The koala turned, gave her a puzzled look, and shrugged his shoulders. She said, &quot;Come here,&quot; and pulled a dictionary out of her purse. She pointed to the word &quot;prostitute&quot; and its definition: &quot;has sex and gets paid&quot;<br /><br />Finally understanding, the koala borrowed her dictionary, turned to the word &quot;koala&quot;, and showed her: &quot;eats bush and leaves&quot;

				A plane was taking off from Kennedy Airport. After it reached a comfortable cruising altitude, the captain made an announcement over the intercom, &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. Welcome to Flight Number 293, nonstop from New York to Los Angeles. The weather ahead is good and therefore we should have a smooth and uneventful flight. Now sit back and relax - OH MY GOD!&quot;<br /><br />Silence.<br /><br />Then, the captain came back on the intercom and said, &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen, I am so sorry if I scared you earlier, but while I was talking the flight-attendant brought me a cup of coffee and spilled the hot coffee in my lap. &nbsp;You should see the front of my pants!&quot;<br /><br />A passenger in Coach said, &quot;That&#039;s nothing. He should see the back of mine!&quot;<br /><br /><hr /><br />On a Northwest Airlines flight to Boston during a recent hurricane,<br />the captain did his best to skirt the edge of the storm, but it<br />was a pretty rough ride just the same—rough enough that the flight<br />attendants were ordered to strap themselves into their seats for about<br />half an hour, and many of the passengers were putting the little<br />plastic-lined bags in their seat pockets to good use. When the turbulence<br />finally abated, the flight attendants unbuckled themselves, and the<br />captain&#039;s voice came on over the intercom. <br /><br />&quot;Well, folks, that was quite some ride, wasn&#039;t it? But we came through it<br />fine, just the way we always do, and I&#039;m happy to report that it looks like<br />the remainder of our trip should be much calmer. On behalf of myself and<br />today&#039;s flight crew, I&#039;d like to thank you very much for your calmness and<br />cooperation, and extend our best wishes for a pleasant stay in Boston. <br /><br />After a short pause and several clicks . . .<br /><br />&quot;Jesus Christ—whadda bitchin&#039; ride! Boy—I sure could use a cup of<br />good strong coffee and a blow job, right about now.&quot; <br /><br />As a stricken stewardess dashed up the aisle to the cabin to inform the<br />captain that his intercom was still on, one of the passengers called after<br />her, &quot;Don&#039;t forget the coffee!&quot;<br /><br /><hr /><br />There were 3 men in the men&#039;s bathroom at a Las Vegas casino: a guy from <br />Texas, a guy from Canada, and a guy from New York City—all standing <br />side-by-side using the urinal. <br /><br />The guy from Texas finished, zipped up and started washing and literally <br />scrubbing his hands—clear up to his elbows—he used 20 paper towels <br />before he finished. He turned to the other two men and commented, &quot;I was <br />born and raised in Texas where we learn to be extremely clean.&quot;<br /><br />The guy from Canada finished, zipped up and quickly wet the tips of his <br />fingers, grabbed one paper towel and commented, &quot;I was born and raised <br />in Canada and we are taught to be environmentally conscious.&quot; <br /><br />The New York City guy zipped up and as he was walking out the door said, <br />&quot;I was born and raised in New York City and we are taught not to piss on <br />our hands.&quot;

				&quot;Curtain Rods&quot;<br />aka &quot;Best Divorce Story Ever&quot;<br /><br />She spent the first day packing her belongings into<br />boxes, crates and suitcases. On the second day,<br />she had the movers come and collect her things.<br /><br />On the third day, she sat down for the last time at<br />their beautiful dining room table by candle-light,<br />put on some soft background music, and feasted<br />on a pound of shrimp, a jar of caviar, and a bottle<br />of spring-water.<br /><br />When she had finished, she went into each and<br />every room and deposited a few half-eaten shrimp<br />shells dipped in caviar into the hollow of the curtain<br />rods.<br /><br />She then cleaned up the kitchen and left. When the<br />husband returned with his new girlfriend, all was<br />bliss for the first few days.<br /><br />Then slowly, the house began to smell. They tried<br />everything; cleaning, mopping and airing the place<br />out. Vents were checked for dead rodents and<br />carpets were steam cleaned. Air fresheners were<br />hung everywhere. Exterminators were brought in to<br />set off gas canisters, during which they had to move<br />out for a few days and in the end they even paid to<br />replace the expensive wool carpeting.<br /><br />Nothing worked.<br /><br />People stopped coming over to visit. Repairmen<br />refused to work in the house. The maid quit.<br /><br />Finally, they could not take the stench any longer<br />and decided to move. A month later, even though<br />they had cut their price in half, they could not find<br />a buyer for their stinky house. Word got out and<br />eventually even the local realtors refused to return<br />their calls.<br /><br />Finally, they had to borrow a huge sum of money<br />from the bank to purchase a new place.<br /><br />The ex-wife called the man and asked how things<br />were going. He told her the saga of the rotting house.<br />She listened politely and said that she missed her<br />old home terribly and would be willing to reduce her<br />divorce settlement in exchange for getting the house<br />back.<br /><br />Knowing his ex-wife had no idea how bad the smell<br />was, he agreed on a price that was about 1/10th of<br />what the house had been worth, but only if she were<br />to sign the papers that very day.<br /><br />She agreed and within the hour his lawyers delivered<br />the paperwork.<br /><br />A week later the man and his girlfriend stood smiling<br />as they watched the moving company pack everything<br />to take to their new home . . .<br /><br />And, to spite the ex-wife, they even took the curtain rods!!!<br /><br />I LOVE A HAPPY ENDING, DON&#039;T YOU?

				&nbsp; &nbsp; There&#039;s a big controversy on the Jewish view of exactly when life begins. According to most Jewish mothers, a fetus is not considered viable until after it graduates from medical school.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; A man calls his mother in Florida. &quot;Mom, how are you?&quot; &quot;Not too good,&quot; says the mother. &quot;I&#039;ve been very weak.&quot; The son says, &quot;Why are you so weak?&quot; She says, &quot;Because I haven&#039;t eaten in 5 days.&quot; The man says, &quot;That&#039;s terrible! Why haven&#039;t you eaten in 5 days? The mother answers, &quot;Because I didn&#039;t want my mouth to be filled with food if you should call.&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Q: How many Jewish mothers does it take to change a light bulb?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; A: (Sigh) Don&#039;t bother, I&#039;ll sit in the dark, I don&#039;t want to be a nuisance to anybody.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Telegram from a Jewish Mother: &quot;Begin worrying. Details follow.&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; A Jewish boy comes home from school and tells his mother he&#039;s been given a part in the school play. &quot;Wonderful. What part is it?&quot; The boy says, &quot;I play the part of the Jewish husband.&quot; The mother scowls and says, &quot;Go back and tell the teacher you want a speaking part.&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Q: Why do Jewish Mothers make great parole officers?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; A: They never let anyone finish a sentence.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Q: Why does the groom at a Jewish wedding stomp on the wine glass after the wedding toast?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; A: Because it&#039;s the last time he&#039;ll ever be able to put his foot down!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; When the doctor called Mrs. Liebermann to tell her that her check came back, she replied, &quot;So did my arthritis.&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; At the beach Mrs. Cohen began yelling at the lifeguard who had just pulled her husband out of the ocean and told her he would start giving him artificial respiration.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;You&#039;ll either give my Benny real respiration or nothing!&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Short summary of every Jewish Holiday: They tried to kill us, we won, so let&#039;s eat.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; A Jewish Mother&#039;s Answering Machine:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you want chicken soup, press 1;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you want matzoh balls with the soup, press 2;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you want varnishkas, dial 3;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you want knishes press 4;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you want to know how am I feeling, you are calling the wrong number since nobody ever asks me how I am feeling.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Mrs. Goldberg, age 75, went to see a gynecologist for the first time in her life. She was asked to step behind a screen and remove her clothes so the doctor could examine her. At some point during the examination, Mrs. Goldberg said, &quot;Excuse me, doctor, can I ask you a question?&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Certainly,&quot; the doctor replied.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Tell me,&quot; she said. &quot;Your mother knows that from this you make a living?&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; A Jewish Mother&#039;s Last Wish:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; A woman in Brooklyn decided to prepare her will and make her final requests.

In death&#039;s agony he suddenly smelled the aroma of his favorite Rugalach wafting up the stairs. He gathered his remaining strength and lifted himself from the bed.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Leaning against the wall, he slowly made his way out of the bedroom and, with even greater effort, forced himself down the stairs, gripping the railing with both hands. With labored breath, he leaned against the door frame, gazing into the kitchen.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Were it not for the pain he was in, he would have thought himself already in heaven. There, spread out on linen wraps on the kitchen table were literally hundreds of his favorite Rugalach. Was this one final act of love from his devoted wife, seeing to it that he left this world a happy man?<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Mustering one last final effort, he threw himself toward the table, landing on his knees beside the table. His parched lips parted; the wondrous taste of the pastry was already in his mouth, seemingly bringing him back to life.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; His aged and withered hand, shaking, had almost reached a piece at the edge of the table when it was suddenly smacked with a spatula by his wife.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Stay out of those,&quot; she said. &quot;They&#039;re for the after.&quot; <br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Q: How can you recognize a JAP?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; A: Her lap dog owns more clothes and toys than the neighbor&#039;s children, and the only thing she knows how to make for dinner is reservations<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Q: Have you seen the newest Jewish-American Princess horror movie?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; A: It&#039;s called &quot;Debbie Does Dishes.&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Q: What&#039;s the difference between a Jewish American Princess and an Italian American Princess?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; A: With the Italian American Princess, the jewels are fake, but the orgasms are real.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Q: What&#039;s a Jewish American Princess&#039;s favorite position?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; A: Facing Bloomingdale&#039;s

He goes to the leather worker with all the skin he has saved. “I vant you should make me a memento of my years as a Mohel.” The leather worker assures him that this can be done, and he should come by the following week and pick it up. When the Mohel returns, the leather worker presents him with a wallet. The Mohel is incensed. “I vork for 50 years and all you can give me is a vallet?” The leather worker replies, &quot;But it is a special kind of wallet. When you rub it, it becomes a suitcase!”<br /><br /><hr /><br />A Baptist Minister, a Priest and a Rabbi were sitting around on Thursday discussing religious issues. The subject of donations came up.<br /><br />The Baptist Minister said: “I have a system. When the service is over, I take all the money and go in the back of my church. I draw a circle in the ground and throw the money up in the air. Whatever lands inside the circle I keep for my church. Whatever lands outside the circle, I send to the National Assembly For G-d.”<br /><br />“That’s amazing!” said the Priest. “I have a very similar system. When Mass is over, I take the collection to the back of the rectory. I draw a straight line in the ground. Whatever lands on the right side I keep for the parish. Whatever lands on the left side I send to the Vatican for G-d.”<br /><br />“You know something?” asked the Rabbi. “You are not going to believe this, but, I have a system like that, too. After Havdalah I go in back of the Shul. I throw the gelt up in the air and whatever G-d can catch—he can keep.”<br /><br /><hr /><br />A Catholic Priest, a Protestant Minister and a Rabbi were asked for their definition of when life begins.<br /><br />The Priest said, “When the sperm travels up the birth canal, and lodges itself in the ovum, at this instant—the moment of conception—life begins.”<br /><br />The Minister, smiles and calmly says: “Sir, I cannot agree with that concept. In fact, life, as we know it, truly begins when the fetus leaves the birth canal and takes it’s first breath of life.”<br /><br />The Rabbi, without hesitation exclaims: “Life begins when the kids leave home and the dog dies.”<br /><br /><hr /><br />85-year old Sadie Bernstein from Miami Beach loves to go swimming every morning. Her only problem? Her cigarettes get soggy. Her friend Molly says to her, “Put the cigarettes in a condom and they’ll stay dry.” So Sadie runs to the nearest drug store and asks the pharmacist for a pack of condoms. The guy is truly surprised by the request. “Lady,” he asks “any particular brand?” To which she replies, in a thick Yiddish accent, “Brand Shmand, as long as they fit a Camel!”<br /><hr /><br />G-d spoke to Adam and said, “I have good news for you and I have bad news for you. The good news is that I am giving you two new body parts. First, I am giving you a brain so that you can think and develop a relationship with Eve. Second, I am giving you a penis so that you can go forth and populate<br /><br />“Great!” said Adam, “What’s the bad news?”<br /><br />“The bad news is that I’m only going to give you enough blood to use one at a time.&quot;<br /><br /><hr /><br />Two little boys talking:<br />“I’m getting operated on tomorrow.”<br />“Oh? What are they going to do?”<br />“Circumsize me!”<br />“I had that done when I was just a few days old.”<br />“Did it hurt?”<br />“I couldn’t walk for a year!”<br /><br /><hr /><br />What is the only thing a JAP will go down on?<br />The escalator at Neiman Marcus.<br /><br /><hr /><br />An old Jewish man goes into a doctor&#039;s office complaining that each<br />morning he urinates at 6:00am and he has a bowel movement at 7:00am,<br />without fail.

Sir, how long have you been coming to the Wall and praying?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;For about 50 years.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;What do you pray for?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;For peace between the Jews and the Arabs. For all the hatred to stop. For our children to grow up in safety and friendship.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;How do you feel after doing this for 50 years?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Like I&#039;m talking to a effing wall.&quot; <br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />An American tourist was riding in a taxi in Israel. As the taxi approached a red light, the tourist was shocked to see the driver drive straight through without even slowing down. Surprised as he was, he didn&#039;t say anything feeling himself a &quot;guest&quot; and not wanting to make waves. The trip continued without event until the next intersection. This time the light was green and, to the American&#039;s dismay, the cab driver brought the vehicle to a grinding halt. Unable to contain his astonishment, he turns to the driver.<br /><br />&quot;Listen.&quot; he says, &quot;When you went through the red light, I didn&#039;t say anything. But why on earth are you stopping at a green light?&quot;<br /><br />The Israeli driver looks at him as if the American was deranged: &quot;Are you crazy?!&quot;, he shouts. &quot;The other guy has a red light! Do you want to get us killed?&quot; <br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Late at night, a woman is woken from her sleep by a bat suddenly swooping into her room through a window.<br /><br />She watches as the bat transforms itself into a vampire. She grips the pillow tightly, but is too afraid to speak.<br /><br />The vampire slowly approaches, but as it almost reaches her, the woman suddenly remembers the cross on her night-stand.<br /><br />She grabs it tightly, holding it out towards the vampire and, in a trembling voice,cries,<br /><br />&quot;You can&#039;t come closer! I have a cross.&quot;<br /><br />The vampire looks the woman in the eye and responds, &quot;Lady, Es vet dir gornisht helfen!&quot; <br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />A priest, a Pentecostal preacher and a Rabbi all served as chaplains<br />to the students of Northern Michigan University in Marquette.<br /><br />They would get together two or three times a week for coffee and to talk shop.<br /><br />One day, someone made the comment that preaching to people isn&#039;t really all that hard. A real challenge would be to preach to a bear.<br /><br />One thing led to another and they decided to do an experiment. They would all go out into the woods, find a bear, preach to it, and attempt to convert it.<br /><br />Seven days later, they&#039;re all together to discuss the experience.<br /><br />Father Flannery, who has his arm in a sling, is on crutches, and has various bandages on his body and limbs, goes first. &quot;Well,&quot; he says, &quot;I went into the woods to find me a bear. And when I found him I began to read to him from the Catechism. Well, that bear wanted nothing to do with me and began to slap me around. So I quickly grabbed my holy water, sprinkled him and, Holy Mary Mother of<br />God, he became as gentle a lamb. The bishop is coming out next week to give him first communion and confirmation.&quot;<br /><br />Reverend Billy Bob spoke next. He was in a wheelchair, with an arm and both legs in casts, and an IV drip. In his best fire and brimstone oratory he claimed, &quot; WELL brothers, you KNOW that we don&#039;t sprinkle! I went out and I FOUND me a bear. And then I began to read<br />to my bear from God&#039;s HOLY WORD! But that bear wanted nothing to do with me. So I took HOLD of him and we began to wrestle. We wrestled down one hill, UP another and DOWN another until we came to a creek.<br />So I quick DUNKED him and BAPTIZED his hairy soul.And just like you said, he became as gentle as a lamb. We spent the rest of the day praising Jesus.&quot;<br /><br />They both looked down at the rabbi, who was lying in a hospital bed. He was in a body cast and traction with IV&#039;s and monitors running in and out of him. He was in bad shape.<br /><br />The rabbi looks up and says, &quot;Looking back on it, circumcision may not have been the best way to start.&quot;

				A man wonders if having sex on the Sabbath is a sin because he is not sure if sex is work or play. So he goes to a priest and asks for his opinion on this question.<br /><br /><br /><br />After consulting the bible, the priest says, &quot; My son, after an exhaustive search, I am positive that sex is work and is therefore not permitted on Sundays.<br />&quot;The man thinks: &quot; What does a priest know about sex?&quot;<br />So he goes to a minister, who after all is a married man and experienced in this matter.<br />He queries the minister and receives the same reply. Sex is work and therefore not for the Sabbath!<br /><br /><br /><br />Not pleased with the reply, he seeks out the ultimate authority: a man of thousands of years tradition and knowledge. In other words, he goes to a rabbi. The Rabbi ponders the question, then states, &quot;My son, sex is definitely play.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />The man replies, &quot;Rabbi, how can you be o sure when so many others tell me sex is work?&quot;<br />The Rabbi softly speaks, &quot;If sex were work, my wife would have the maid do it.&quot;

				A doctor at an insane asylum decided to take<br />his patients to a baseball game. For weeks<br />in advance, he coached his patients to respond<br />to his commands.<br /><br />When the day of the game arrived, everything<br />went quite well. As the National Anthem started<br />the doctor yelled, &quot;Up Nuts&quot; and the patients<br />complied by standing up.<br /><br />After the anthem, he yelled, &quot;Down Nuts,&quot; and they<br />all sat back down in their seats. After a home run<br />was hit, the doctor yelled, &quot;Cheer Nuts.&quot; They all<br />broke out into applause and cheered.<br /><br />When the umpire made a particularly bad call<br />against the star of the home team, the Doctor<br />yelled, &quot;Booooo Nuts&quot; and they all started booing<br />and cat calling.<br /><br />Comfortable with their response, the doctor<br />decided to go get a beer and a hot dog, leaving<br />his assistant in charge. When he returned, there<br />was a riot in progress. Finding his dizzied assistant,<br />the doctor asked, &quot;What in the world happened?&quot;<br /><br />The assistant replied, &quot;Well everything was<br />going just fine until this guy walked by and<br />yelled, &#039;PEANUTS!&#039;&quot;<br /><br /><hr /><br />Morris comes home to find his wife, Sadie, crying. &quot;I found out from<br />Mrs. Goldberg that you&#039;ve been having an affair with that chippie<br />secretary in your office. Why would you do that to me? Haven&#039;t I always<br />been the good wife? I&#039;ve cooked for you, raised your children, and I&#039;ve<br />always been by your side for thirty-five years. What haven&#039;t I done to<br />make you happy?&quot;<br /><br />Embarrassed, Morris confesses, &quot;It&#039;s true, Sadie, you&#039;ve been the best<br />wife a man could hope for. You make me happy in all ways but one. You<br />don&#039;t moan when we have sex!&quot;<br /><br />&quot;If I moaned when we had sex, you&#039;d stop running around?! All right,<br />come to the bedroom so I can show you that I, too, can moan during sex!&quot;<br />So they retire to the bedroom, get undressed, and climb beneath the<br />sheets.<br /><br />As they begin to kiss, Sadie asks, &quot;Now, Morris, should I moan now?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;No not yet.&quot;<br /><br />Morris begins fondling Sadie. &quot;What about now? Should I moan now?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;No, I&#039;ll tell you when&quot;<br /><br />He climbs on top of Sophie and begins to have intercourse.<br />&quot;Is it time for me to moan, Morris?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Wait, I&#039;ll tell you when.&quot;<br /><br />Moments later, in the heat of passion, seconds before reaching climax,<br />Morris yells &quot;Now, Sadie, moan! MOAN!&quot;<br /><br />&quot;OY! You wouldn&#039;t believe what a day I had!&quot;<br /><br /><hr /><br />Goldie Cohen, an elderly Jewish lady from New York, goes to her travel<br />&nbsp;agent.<br /><br />&nbsp;&quot;I vont to go to India.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&quot;Mrs. Cohen, why India? It&#039;s filthy, much hotter than New York, it&#039;s<br />&nbsp;filled to the brim with Indians.&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp;&quot;I vont to go to India.&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp;&quot;But it&#039;s a long journey, and those trains, how will you manage? What<br />&nbsp;will you eat? The food is too hot and spicy for you. You can&#039;t drink the<br />&nbsp;water. You must not eat fresh fruit and vegetables. You&#039;ll get sick: the<br />&nbsp;plague, hepatitis, cholera, typhoid, malaria, G-d only knows. What will<br />&nbsp;you do? Can you imagine the hospital, no Jewish doctors? Why torture<br />&nbsp;yourself?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I vont to go to India.&quot;<br /><br />The necessary arrangements are made, and off she goes. She arrives in<br />India and, undeterred by the noise, smell and crowds, makes her way to<br />an ashram. There she joins the seemingly never-ending queue of people<br />waiting for an audience with the guru. An aide tells her that it will<br />take at least three days of standing in line to see the guru.<br /><br />&quot;Dats OK.&quot;<br /><br />Eventually she reaches the hallowed portals. There she is told firmly<br />that she can only say three words.<br /><br />&quot;Fine.&quot;<br /><br />She is ushered into the inner sanctum where the wise guru is seated,<br />ready to bestow spiritual blessings upon eager initiates. Just before<br />she reaches the holy of holies she is once again reminded:<br />&quot;Remember, just three words.&quot;<br /><br />Unlike the other devotees, she does not prostate at his feet. She stands<br />directly in front of him, crosses her arms over her chest, fixes her<br />gaze on his, and says: &quot;Sheldon, come home.&quot;<br /><br /><hr /><br />Six Jewish gentlemen were playing poker in the condo clubhouse when Meyerowitz loses $500 on a single hand, clutches his chest, and drops dead at the table. Showing respect for their fallen comrade, the other five complete their playing time standing up. Finkelstein looks around and asks &quot;Now, who is going to tell the wife?&quot; They draw straws.<br /><br />Goldberg, who is always the loser, picks the short one. They tell him to be discreet, be gentle, don&#039;t make a bad situation any worse than it is.<br /><br />&quot;Gentlemen! Discreet? I&#039;m the most discreet mensch you will ever meet. Discretion is mine middle name, leave it to me.&quot;<br /><br />Goldberg schleps over to the Meyerowitz apartment, and knocks on the door. The wife answers and asks what he wants.<br /><br />Goldberg declares, &quot;Your husband just lost $500.&quot;<br /><br />She screams, &quot;Tell him he should drop dead!&quot;<br /><br />Goldberg says, &quot;You got it!&quot;<br />

				Many years ago, when I was a young boy, I found a mezuzah on the wall of a deserted house near my street. As there was still time before I had to get home for my tea, I pulled it off the wall and opened it.

				The Internal Revenue sends their auditor (a nasty<br />little man) to audit a synagogue.

				Never hire a man to do a woman&#039;s job ....... <br /><br />A few months ago, there was an opening with the CIA for an assassin. These highly classified positions are hard to fill, and there&#039;s a lot of testing and background checks involved before you can even be considered for the position. <br /><br />After sending some applicants through the background checks, training and testing, they narrowed the possible choices down to two men and a woman, but only one position was available. <br /><br />The day came for the final test to see which person would get the extremely secretive job. The CIA men administering the test took one of the men to a large metal door and handed him a gun. &quot;We must know that you will follow your instructions no matter what the circumstances,&quot; they explained. &quot;Inside this room, you will find your wife sitting in a chair. Take this gun and kill her.&quot; <br /><br />The man got a shocked look on his face and said, &quot;You can&#039;t be serious! I could never shoot my own wife!&quot; Well,&quot; said the CIA man, &quot;you&#039;re definitely not the right man for this job then.&quot; <br /><br />So they bring the second man to the same door and hand him a gun. &quot;We must know that you will follow instructions no matter what the circumstances,&quot; they explained to the second man. &quot;Inside you will find your wife sitting in a chair. Take this gun and kill her.&quot; <br /><br />The second man looked a bit shocked, but nevertheless took the gun and went in the room. All was quiet for about five minutes, then the door opened. The man came out of the room with tears in his eyes. &quot;I tried to shoot her. I just couldn&#039;t pull the trigger and shoot my wife. I guess I&#039;m not the right man for the job.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;No,&quot; the CIA man replied. &quot;You don&#039;t have what it takes. Take your wife and go the hell home.&quot; <br /><br />Now they&#039;re down to the woman left to test. Again they lead her to the same door and hand her the same gun. &quot;We must be sure that you will follow instructions no matter what the circumstances. This is your final test. Inside you will find your husband sitting in a chair. Take this gun and kill him.&quot; <br /><br />The woman took the gun and opened the door. Before the door even closed all the way, the CIA heard the gun start firing, one shot after another, for 13 shots. Then they heard screaming, crashing, banging on the walls. This went on for several minutes, then all went quiet. The door opened slowly, and there stood the woman....... She wiped the sweat from her brow and said, &quot;You guys didn&#039;t tell me the gun was loaded with blanks! I had to beat the son of a bitch to death with the chair!&quot; <br />

				Two dwarves are walking through the back streets after a heavy night on the town when they pass a brothel. One looks at the other. “What do you reckon? Should we finish the night with a bang?” he asks. “Yeah, why not?” replies the other, so they go in, pick the girls they want and head up to the rooms. The first dwarf is in a bit of a drunken state, and no matter what the young lady does he just can’t get an erection. To make it worse, he’s right next door to his friend and his young lady, and all he can hear from the other room is “one… two… three… huuuurrrgh! One… two… three… huuuurrrgh!” Eventually he apologises to the girl, pays and leaves. The next day the two dwarves meet up and share their stories. “It was so embarrassing,” says the first dwarf, “I just couldn’t get it up.” “You think that’s bad?” retorts the second, “I couldn’t even get onto the bed!”

				A man walks into an antique store, and starts looking around. <br />All of the sudden he spies a huge brass rat statue in the corner. He <br />falls in love with it, and so he takes it to the cashier.<br /><br />&quot;The rat, eh?&quot; says the old grizzly cashier<br /><br />&quot;Umm, yeah...how much?&quot; replies our friend<br /><br />&quot;Well, five bucks for the rat statue--but 200 dollars for the story,&quot; <br />he replied.<br /><br />&quot;I&#039;ll just take the rat statue, without the story.&quot; Says the customer.<br /><br />He leaves the store, his precious brass rat tucked under his <br />arm. Soon he begins to notice that a few rats are following him. <br />He walks a few more blocks and the number of rats behind him <br />increased. This continued, until there were virtually millions <br />of rats behind him.<br /><br />Afraid of this mass following the man ran to the sea and threw <br />the rat statue in. All of the rats plunged in after it, and met their <br />watery deaths.<br /><br />The man ran back to the antique store. The old cashier was <br />chuckling to himself. &quot;So now do you want the story?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;No,&quot; said the man, &quot;but have you got any brass lawyer statues?&quot;<br /><br /><br /><hr /><br />A guy walks into a post office one day to see a middle-aged, balding man<br />standing at the counter methodically placing &quot;Love&quot; stamps on bright pink<br />envelopes with hearts all over them.

				One day, Dave was out raking leaves when he noticed a hearse slowly drive by. Following the first hearse was a second hearse, which was followed by a man walking solemnly along, followed by a dog, and then about 200 men walking in single file. <br />Intrigued, Dave went up to the man following the second hearse and asked him who was in the first hearse. <br />“My wife,” the man replied. <br />“I’m sorry,” said Dave. “What happened to her?” <br />&quot;My dog bit her and she died.” Dave then asked who was in the second hearse. <br />The man replied, “My mother-in-law. My dog bit her and she died as well.” <br />“Can I borrow your dog?” <br />“Get in line,” replied the man. <br /><br />

				The IRS is auditing Steinberg&#039;s return. The agent asks Steinberg about a <br />$20,000 charitable deduction. Steinberg explains that this is a donation <br />to his synagogue.<br /><br />After Steinberg leaves, the agent, still suspicious, calls Steinberg&#039;s <br />synagogue and asks for the Rabbi. He explains &quot;Mr. Steinberg indicates <br />that he made a $20,000 donation to your synagogue, we would like to <br />confirm it.&quot; <br /><br />The Rabbi very adamantly and enthusiastically says &quot;He certainly did!&quot; The<br />IRS agent, still not quite comfortable, asks &quot;When did he make this<br />contribution&quot;.

				A new priest at his first mass was so nervous he could hardly speak.<br /><br />After mass he asked the monsignor how he had done.<br /><br />The monsignor replied, &quot;When I am worried about getting nervous on the pulpit, I put a glass of vodka next to the water glass. if I start to get nervous, I take a sip.&quot;<br /><br />So next Sunday he took the monsignor&#039;s advice. At the beginning of the sermon, he got nervous and took a drink. He proceeded to talk up a storm.<br /><br />Upon his return to his office after mass, he found the following note on the door:<br /><br />1. Sip the Vodka, don&#039;t gulp.<br />2. There are 10 commandments, not 12.<br />3. There are 12 disciples, not 10.<br />4. Jesus was consecrated, not constipated.<br />5. Jacob wagered his donkey, he did not bet his ass.<br />6. We do not refer to Jesus Christ as the late J. C.<br />7. The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not referred to as Daddy, Junior and the Spook.<br />8. David slew Goliath, he did not kick the s___ out of him.<br />9. When David was hit by a rock and was knocked off his donkey,don&#039;t say he was stoned off his ass.<br />10. We do not refer to the cross as the &quot;Big T.&quot;<br />11. When Jesus broke the bread at the Last Supper he said, &quot;Take this and eat it for it is my body.&quot; He did not say &quot;Eat me&quot;<br />12. The Virgin Mary is not called &quot;Mary with the Cherry,&quot;<br />13. The recommended grace before a meal is not: Rub-A-Dub-Dub thanks for the grub, yeah God.<br />14. Next Sunday there will be a taffy pulling contest at St. Peter&#039;s, not a Peter pulling contest at St. Taffy&#039;s!<br /><br />

				There once were two priests, father Dick and father Ray.<br /><br /><br />One day after a very long mass, the two priests decided to hit the showers, halfway through there showers the priests realized that there was no soap.<br /><br />So, father Ray says to Father dick &quot;I have extra soap in my room, I&#039;ll go get some&quot;.<br /><br />So he leaves to fetch the soap and doesn&#039;t bother to get dressed because who would still be in the church at such a late hour? So he comes back from his room with two bars of soap and is walking down the hall when suddenly he hears voices coming around the corner, so with his quick thinking he froze to the wall, stiff as a statue.<br /><br />The voices turned out to be that of three nuns, who, when saw him standing there like a statue stopped to look at and admire him complimenting at how realistic he looks and what a nice body he has.<br /><br />When suddenly one of the nuns reaches out and grabbed his penis.<br /><br />Startled, he dropped a bar of soap, with this the nun said &quot;Oh look, a soap dispenser&quot;, wanting to test the first nuns theory the second nun reaches out and also grabs his penis, again he drops a bar of soap.<br /><br />With this the nun says &quot;Yes it&#039;s true, it is a soap dispenser&quot;.<br /><br />Wanting to get her share of soap and excitement too, the third nun reaches out and grabs his penis.<br /><br />But nothing happended for he was all out of soap, so she goes on yanking and pulling his penis for the next few minutes until, to her delight, she squeals &quot;Oh! Look, handcream!&quot;

				<strong>Three Good Arguments</strong><br /><br />There were 3 good arguments that Jesus was Black:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1. He called everyone brother<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2. He liked Gospel<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;3. He didn&#039;t get a fair trial<br /><br />&nbsp;But then there were 3 equally good arguments that Jesus was Jewish:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1. He went into his Father&#039;s business<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. He lived at home until he was 33<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3. He was sure his Mother was a virgin and his Mother was sure he was God<br /><br />&nbsp;But then there were 3 equally good arguments that Jesus was Italian:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. He talked with his hands<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. He had wine with his meals<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3. He used olive oil<br /><br />&nbsp;But then there were 3 equally good arguments that Jesus was a Californian:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. He never cut his hair<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. He walked around barefoot all the time<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3. He started a new religion<br /><br />&nbsp;But then there were 3 equally good arguments that Jesus was an American Indian:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. He was at peace with nature<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. He ate a lot of fish<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3. He talked about the Great Spirit<br /><br />&nbsp;But then there were 3 equally good arguments that Jesus was Irish:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. He never got married<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. He was always telling stories<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;3. He loved green pastures<br /><br />&nbsp;But the most compelling evidence of all - 3 proofs that Jesus was a woman:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1. He fed a crowd at a moment&#039;s notice when there was virtually no food<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2. He kept trying to get a message across to a bunch of men who just didn&#039;t get it<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;3. And even when he was dead, he had to get up because there was still work to do

				There is a woman lying in a coma. The doctors were very worried as she was showing no response to any external stimulus. However, one day when a nurse was giving her a bed bath and washed the privates she noticed the woman&#039;s eyes fluttering. When she dried her, she also noticed her eyes moving. She called the doctor. When the doctor gave her an examination he too noticed the eyes moving. Spotting a possible breakthrough they called her husband in. Explaining the situation the doctors explained that they wanted the husband to have oral sex with the woman, as that may bring her around. The husband of course agreed, saying he would do anything to get his wife back, but that he didn&#039;t think he could do it with the medical staff present. The doctors said they had thought of this and would retire to an adjacent room with one of the monitors. This was all agreed and they moved next door. The machine was running.<br /><br />beep beep ..............................<br />&nbsp;beep beep ..............................<br />beep beep ..............................<br />beep beep ..............................<br />beep beep ..............................<br />beep beep ..............................<br />beep beep ..............................<br />beep beep ........................<br />beep beep ........................<br />beep beep ........................<br />beep beep ........................<br />beep beep ...............<br />beep beep ...............<br />beep beep ...............<br />beep beep ...<br />beep beep ...<br />beep beep ...<br />beep beep ...<br />beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeppppppppppppppppp<br /><br />The doctors rushed in, her heart had stopped.<br /><br />&quot;What happened&quot; they said.<br /><br />He said, &quot;I was having oral sex with her as you asked, and she choked to death&quot;

				One day Mr. Jones went to have a talk with the minister<br />at his church. &quot;Reverend,&quot; he said, &quot;I have a problem;<br />my wife keeps falling asleep during your sermons. It&#039;s<br />very embarrassing. What should I do?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I have an idea,&quot; said the minister. &quot;Take this pin<br />with you. I&#039;ll be able to tell when she&#039;s sleeping, and<br />I will motion to you at specific times. When I motion,<br />you give her a good poke in the leg with the pin.&quot;<br /><br />In church the following Sunday, Mrs. Jones dozed off.<br />Noticing this, the preacher put his plan to work.<br />&quot;. . . And who made the ultimate sacrifice for you?&quot; he<br />said, nodding to Mr. Jones.<br /><br />&quot;Jesus!&quot; cried Mrs. Jones as her husband jabbed her in<br />the leg with the pin.<br /><br />&quot;Yes, you are right, Mrs. Jones,&quot; said the minister.<br /><br />Soon, Mrs. Jones nodded off again. Again, the minister<br />noticed her dozing. &quot;Who is your redeemer?&quot; he asked<br />the congregation, motioning towards Mr. Jones.<br /><br />&quot;G-d!&quot; cried out Mrs. Jones as she was stuck again with<br />the pin once again. &quot;Right again, Mrs. Jones,&quot; said the<br />minister, smiling and continuing his sermon.<br /><br />Before long, Mrs. Jones dozed off again. However, this<br />time the minister didn&#039;t notice. As he picked up the<br />tempo of his sermon, he made a few motions that Mr.<br />Jones mistook as signals to wake his wife again.<br /><br />He was just sticking his wife with the pin again when<br />the minister asked, &quot;. . . And what did Eve say to Adam<br />after she bore him his 99th son?&quot;<br /><br />Mrs. Jones shrieked, &quot;You stick that damned thing in me<br />one more time and I&#039;ll break it off and shove it up<br />your butt!&quot;<br />

				Jack wakes up with a huge hangover after the night<br />at a business function. He forces himself to open<br />his eyes and the first thing he sees is a couple of<br />aspirins next to a glass of water on the side table.<br />And, next to them, a single red rose!<br /><br />Jack sits down and sees his clothing in front of him,<br />all clean and pressed.<br /><br />Jack looks around the room and sees that it is in perfect<br />order, spotlessly clean. So is the rest of the house.<br /><br />He takes the aspirins, cringes when he sees a huge<br />black eye staring back at him in the bathroom mirror<br />and notices a note on the table:<br /><br />&quot;Honey, breakfast is on the stove, I left early to go shopping,<br />love you!!&quot;<br /><br />He stumbles to the kitchen and sure enough, there is hot<br />breakfast and the morning newspaper.<br /><br />His son is also at the table, eating. Jack asks, &quot;Son...<br />what happened last night?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Well, you came home after 3 am, drunk and out of your<br />mind. You broke the coffee table, puked in the hallway and<br />got that black eye when you ran into the door.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;So, why is everything in such perfect order, so clean, I have<br />a rose and breakfast is on the table waiting for me?&quot;<br /><br />His son replies, &quot;Oh, THAT!. . . Mom dragged you to the<br />bedroom and when she tried to take your pants off, you<br />screamed, &quot;Leave me alone, bitch, I&#039;m married!!!&quot;<br /><br />Broken table - $200<br />Hot breakfast - $5<br />Red Rose bud - $3<br />Two aspirins - $0.25<br />Saying the right thing, at the right time . . .<br /><br /><br /><br />Priceless

				&#039;Twas the night before Christmas, and boy was it neat.<br />The kids were both gone, and my wife was in heat.<br /><br />The doors were all bolted, the phone off the hook,<br />It was time for some nooky, by hook or by crook.<br /><br />Momma in her teddy and I in the nude,<br />Had just hit the bedroom and reached for the lube.<br /><br />When out on the lawn there arose such a cry,<br />That I lost my boner, and momma went dry.<br /><br />Up to the window I sprang like an elf,<br />Tore back the shade while she played with herself.<br /><br />The moon on the crest of the snowman we&#039;d built,<br />Showed a broom up his ass, clean up to the hilt.<br /><br />When what to my wondering eyes should appear,<br />But a rusty old sleigh and eight mangy reindeer.<br /><br />With a fat little driver, half out of the sled,<br />A sock in his ear and a bra on his head.<br /><br />Sure as I&#039;m speaking, he was high as a kite,<br />And he yelled to his team, but it didn&#039;t sound right.<br /><br />Whoa Shithead, whoa Asshole, whoa Stupid, whoa Putz,<br />Either slow down this rig or I&#039;ll cut off your nuts.<br /><br />Look out for the lamp post, and don&#039;t hit the tree,<br />Quit shaking the sleigh, &#039;cause I gotta go pee.<br /><br />They cleared the old lamp post, the tree got a rub,<br />Just as Santa leaned out and puked on my shrub.<br /><br />And then from the roof we heard such a clatter,<br />As each little reindeer now emptied his bladder.<br /><br />I was donning my jockeys, to cover my ass,<br />When down the chimney Santa came with a crash.<br /><br />His suit was al smelly with perfume galore,<br />He looked like a bum and smelled like a whore.<br /><br />&quot;That was some brothel,&quot; he said with a smile,<br />&quot;The reindeer are pooped . . . I&#039;ll just stay awhile&quot;<br /><br />He walked to the kitchen for himself poured a drink,<br />Then whipped out his pecker and pissed in the sink.<br /><br />I started to laugh, my wife smiled with glee,<br />The old boy was hung nearly down to his knee.<br /><br />Back in the den, Santa reached in his sack,<br />But his toys were all gone, and some new things were packed.<br /><br />The first thing he found was a pair of false teeth,<br />The next was a handgun with a penis that spits.<br /><br />A box filled with condoms was Santas next find,<br />And six pair of panties, the edible kind.<br /><br />A bra without nipples, a penis extension,<br />And several more things I can&#039;t even mention.<br /><br />A f___ ring, a G-string, and all types of oil,<br />And a dildo so long that it lay in a coil.<br /><br />&quot;This stuff ain&#039;t for kids, Mrs. Santa will s___,<br />So I&#039;ll leave &#039;em here, and then I&#039;ll just split.&quot;<br /><br />He filled every stocking and then took his leave,<br />With one tiny butt plug stuck under his sleeve.<br /><br />He sprang to his sleigh, but his feet were like lead,<br />Thus he fell on his ass and broke wind instead.<br /><br />In time he was seated, took reigns of his hitch,<br />Saying,&quot;Take me home, Rudolf. This night&#039;s been a bitch!&quot;<br /><br />The sleigh was near gone when we heard Santa shout,<br />&quot;The best thing about pansy is you can&#039;t wear it out!!&quot;

				A few days after Christmas, a mother was working in the kitchen listening to her young son playing with his new electric train in the living room. She heard the train stop and her son said, &quot;All of you sons of bitches who want off, get the hell off now, cause this is the last stop! And all of you sons of bitches who are getting on, get your asses in the train, cause we&#039;re going down the tracks.&quot; <br /><br />The mother went nuts and told her son, &quot;We don&#039;t use that kind of language in this house. Now I want you to go to your room and you are to stay there for TWO HOURS. When you come out, you may play with your train, but I want you to use nice language.&quot; <br /><br />Two hours later, the son comes out of the bedroom and resumes playing with his train. Soon the train stopped and the mother heard her son say, &quot;All passengers who are disembarking from the train, please remember to take all of your belongings with you. We thank you for riding with us today and hope your trip was a pleasant one. We hope you will ride with us again soon.&quot; She hears the little boy continue, &quot;For those of you just boarding, we ask you to stow all of your hand luggage under your seat. Remember, there is no smoking on the train. We hope you will have a pleasant and relaxing journey with us today.&quot; <br /><br />As the mother began to smile, the child added, &quot;For those of you who are pissed off about the TWO HOUR delay, please see the bitch in the kitchen.&quot; <br />

				A man traveling by plane was in urgent need of a restroom facility. But each time he tried, it was occupied. The flight attendant, aware of his predicament, suggested he use the attendant&#039;s ladies room, but cautioned him not to press any of the buttons. There next to the paper roll were four buttons marked: &#039;WW&#039;, &#039;WA&#039;, &#039;PP&#039; and &#039;ATR&#039;. <br /><br />Making the mistake so many men make of not listening to a woman, he disregarded what she said when his curiosity got the best of him. He carefully pressed the WW button and immediately a gentle flush of Warm Water sprayed on his bare bottom. He thought &quot;Wow,these gals really have it nice.&quot; So a little more boldly he pressed the WA button and body temperature Warm Air blew across his wet bottom and dried it comfortably. &quot;Aha&quot; he thought, &quot;no wonder these women take so long in the bathroom with these kinds of services.&quot; So he pushed the next button PP with anticipation. A soft disposable Powder Puff swung below him and dusted his bottom lightly with talc. &quot;Man, this is great,&quot; he thought as he reach out for the ATR button. <br /><br />When he awoke in the hospital, the morphine was just wearing off. Confused, he buzzed the nurse to find out what happened. He explained the last thing he remembered was intense pain in the ladies room on the plane. The nurse explained, &quot;Yes, you must have been having a great time until you pushed the Automatic Tampon Removal button. By the way, your penis is under your pillow.&quot; <br />

				At the Russian War College, the guest lecturer, a general, is telling the class of officers that the session will focus on potential problems and the resulting strategies.<br /><br />One of the officers in the class asks, &quot;Will we have to fight in a World War Three?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Yes, comrades, it looks like you will,&quot; answers the general.<br /><br />&quot;And who will be our enemy, Comrade General?&quot; another officer asks.<br /><br />&quot;The likelihood is that it will be China.&quot;<br /><br />The class looks alarmed, and finally one officer asks, &quot;But Comrade General, we are 150 million people and they are about 1.5 billion. How can we possibly win?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Well,&quot; replies the General, &quot;Think about it. In modern war, it is not the quantity, but the quality that is the key. For example, in the Middle East, 4 million Jews fight against 150 million Arabs, and the Jews have been the winners every time.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;But sir,&quot; ask the panicky officers, &quot;Do we have enough Jews?&quot;<br /><br /><hr /><br />After 20 years of marriage, a couple was lying in bed.<br /><br />One evening, the wife felt her husband begin to touch her in ways he hadn&#039;t in quite some time.<br />&nbsp;<br />It almost tickled as his fingers started at her neck, and then began moving down past the small of her back. He then slid his hand across her shoulders and neck, slowly worked it down over one breast, then the other, stopping just over her lower belly.<br />&nbsp;<br />He then proceeded to place his hand on her left inner arm, caressed past the side of her breast again, working down her side, passed gently over and then in between her buttock and down her leg to her calf.<br />&nbsp;<br />Then, he proceeded up her inner thigh, stopping just at the upper most portion of her leg.<br /><br />He continued in the same manner on her right side, then suddenly stopped, rolled over and became silent.<br /><br />As she had become quite aroused by this caressing, she asked in a loving voice, &quot;That was wonderful. Why did you stop?&quot;&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I found the remote,&quot; he said.<br />

He says to this guy, &quot;Wow, great outfit, what emotion have you come as?&quot; <br /><br />The guy says, &quot;I&#039;m green with envy.&quot;<br /><br />The host replies, &quot;Brilliant, come on in and have a drink.&quot;<br /><br />A few minutes later the next guest arrives and the host opens the door to see a woman covered in a pink body stocking with a feather bow wrapped round her most intimate parts. He says to this woman, &quot;Wow, great outfit, what emotion have you come as?&quot; <br /><br />And she replies, &quot;I&#039;m tickled pink.&quot;<br /><br />The host says, &quot;I love it! Come on in and join the party.&quot;<br /><br />A couple of minutes later the doorbell rings for the third time, and the host opens the door to see two guys from New York, stark naked, one with his penis stuck in a bowl of custard and the other with his penis stuck in a pear. <br /><br />The host is really shocked and says, &quot;Guys, what the hell are you doing? You could get arrested for standing like that out there in the street. What emotion is this supposed to be?&quot;<br /><br />The first guy replies, &quot;Well, I&#039;m fuckin&#039; dis custid, and my friend here has come in dispair.&quot;<br />

				A wife came home early and found her husband in their bedroom making love to a very attractive young woman.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />And she was terribly upset. &#039;You are a disrespectful pig!&#039; she cried. &#039;How dare you do this to me -- a faithful wife, the mother of your children! I&#039;m leaving you. I want a divorce right away!&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />And the husband replied, &#039;Hang on just a minute, love, so at least I can tell you what happened.&#039; &#039;Fine, go ahead,&#039; she sobbed,&#039; but they&#039;ll be the last words you&#039;ll say to me!&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />And the husband began -- &#039;Well, I was getting into the car to drive home, and this young lady here asked me for a lift. She looked so down and out and defenseless that I took pity on her and let her into the car.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />I noticed that she was very thin, not well dressed and very dirty. She told me that she hadn&#039;t eaten for three days.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />So, in my compassion, I brought her home and warmed up the enchiladas I made for you last night, the ones you wouldn&#039;t eat because you&#039;re afraid you&#039;ll put on weight. The poor thing devoured them in moments.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />Since she needed a good clean-up, I suggested a shower, and while she was doing that, I noticed her clothes were dirty and full of holes, so I threw them away..<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />Then, as she needed clothes, I gave her the designer jeans that you have had for a few years, but don&#039;t wear because you say they are too tight.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />I also gave her the underwear that was your anniversary present, which you don&#039;t wear because I don&#039;t have good taste.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />I found the sexy blouse my sister gave you for Christmas that you don&#039;t wear just to annoy her, and I also donated those boots you bought at the expensive boutique and don&#039;t wear because someone at work has a pair the same.&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />The husband took a quick breath and continued - &#039;She was so grateful for my understanding and help that as I walked her to the door, she turned to me with tears in her eyes and said, &#039;Please ... Do you have anything else that your wife doesn&#039;t use?&#039;<br /><br /><br />

				Professionals Test<br /><br />This quiz consists of four questions that tells you whether or not you are qualified to be a professional. SCROLL DOWN FOR THE ANSWERS. There is no need to cheat. The questions are not that difficult. You just need to think like a professional.<br /><br />1. How do you put a giraffe into a refrigerator?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The correct answer is: Open the refrigerator, put in the giraffe and close the door. This question tests whether or not you are doing simple things in a complicated way.<br /><br /><br /><br />2. How do you put an elephant into a refrigerator?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Incorrect answer: Open the refrigerator, put in the elephant, and close the door.<br />Correct answer: Open the refrigerator, take out the giraffe, put in the elephant and close the door. This question tests your foresight.<br /><br /><br /><br />3. The Lion King is hosting an animal conference. All the animals attend except one. Which animal does not attend?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Correct answer: The elephant. The elephant is in the refrigerator! This tests if you are capable of comprehensive thinking. OK, if you did not answer the last three questions correctly, this one may be your last chance to test your qualifications to be a professional.<br /><br /><br /><br />4. There is a river that is known to have many crocodiles in it. How do you cross it?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Correct Answer: Simply swim across it. All the crocodiles are attending the animal conference! <br /><br /><br /><br />That completes the test!<br /><br />This question tests your reasoning ability. So...<br /><br /><br /><br />If you answered four out of four questions correctly, you&#039;re a true professional. Wealth awaits you.<br /><br /><br />If you answered three out of four, you have some catching up to do but there&#039;s hope for you.<br /><br /><br />If you answered two out of four, consider a career as a hamburger flipper in a fast food joint.<br /><br /><br />If you answered one out of four, try selling your organs. It&#039;s the only way you will ever make any money.<br /><br /><br />If you answered none correctly, consider a career that does not require any higher mental functions at all, such as management, politics, law or medicine.

				A mother passing by her son&#039;s bedroom was astonished<br />to see that his is bed was nicely made and everything<br />was picked up.&nbsp; Then she saw an envelope, propped up<br />prominently on the pillow that was addressed to &#039;Mom&#039;.<br />With the worst premonition she opened the envelope<br />with trembling hands and read the letter.<br /><em><br />Dear Mom:<br /><br />It is with great regret and sorrow that I&#039;m writing you. I<br />had to elope with my new girlfriend because I wanted to<br />avoid a scene with Dad and you. I have been finding real<br />passion with Stacy and she is so nice. But I knew you<br />would not approve of her because of all her piercings,<br />tattoos, tight motorcycle clothes and the fact that she<br />is much older than I am. But it&#039;s not only the passion<br />Mom, she&#039;s pregnant. Stacy said that we will be very<br />happy. She owns a trailer in the woods and has a stack<br />of firewood for the whole winter. We share a dream of<br />having many more children.<br /><br />Stacy has opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana<br />doesn&#039;t really hurt anyone. We&#039;ll be growing it for<br />ourselves and trading it with the other people that<br />live nearby for cocaine and ecstasy. In the meantime<br />we will pray that science will find a cure for AIDS so<br />Stacy can get better. She deserves it. Don&#039;t worry Mom.<br />I&#039;m 15 and I know how to take care of myself.<br /><br />Someday I&#039;m sure that we will be back to visit so that<br />you can get to know your grandchildren.<br />&nbsp;<br />Love,<br />Your Son Paul<br /><br />P.S. Mom, none of the above is true. I&#039;m over at<br />Dustin&#039;s house. I just wanted to remind you that<br />there are worse things in life than the report card<br />that&#039;s in my center desk drawer!<br /><br />I love you.<br /><br />Call me when it&#039;s safe to come home!</em><br />

				The Pentagon recently found it had too many officers,<br />and offered an early retirement bonus. They promised<br />any officer who retired straight away his full annual<br />benefits plus $10,000 for every inch measured in a<br />straight line between any two points on his body, with<br />the officer getting to select any pair of points he wished.<br /><br />The first man, an Air Force general, accepted. He asked<br />the pension man to measure from the top of his head to<br />the tip of his toes. Six feet. He walked out with a check<br />of $720,000.<br /><br />The second man, an Army general, asked them to measure<br />from the tip of his outstretched hands to his toes. Eight feet.<br />He walked out with a check for $960,000.<br /><br />When the third one, a grizzled old Navy commander, was<br />asked where to measure, he told the pension man: &quot;From<br />the tip of my penis to my testicles.&quot;<br /><br />The pension man suggested that perhaps he might like to<br />reconsider, pointing out the nice checks the previous two<br />generals had received. The commander insisted and the<br />pension expert said that would be fine, but that he‚d better<br />get the medical officer to do the measuring.<br /><br />The medical officer attended and asked the commander to<br />drop &#039;em. He did. The medical officer placed the tape on the<br />tip of the commander‚s penis and began to work back. My<br />goodness!&quot; he said. &quot;Where are your testicles?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;In Vietnam,&quot; the commander replied.<br />

				A Jewish businessman was in a great deal of trouble. His business was failing, he had put everything he had into the business, he owed everybody it was so bad he was even contemplating suicide. As a last resort he went to a Rabbi and poured out his story of tears and woe.<br /><br />When he had finished, the Rabbi said, &quot;Here&#039;s what I want you to do:<br /><br />Put a beach chair and your Bible in your car and drive down to the beach. Take the beach chair and the Bible to the water&#039;s edge, sit down in the beach chair, and put the Bible in your lap. Open the Bible; the wind will rifle the pages, but finally the open Bible will come to rest on a page. Look down at the page and read the first thing you see. That will be your answer, that will tell you what to do.&quot;<br /><br />A year later the businessman went back to the Rabbi and brought his wife and children with him. The man was in a new custom-tailored suit, his wife in a mink coat, the children shining. The businessman pulled an envelope stuffed with money out of his pocket, gave it to the Rabbi as a donation in thanks for his advice.<br /><br />The Rabbi recognized the benefactor, and was curious. &quot;You did as I suggested?&quot; he asked.<br /><br />&quot;Absolutely,&quot; replied the businessman.<br /><br />&quot;You went to the beach?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Absolutely.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;You sat in a beach chair with the Bible in your lap?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Absolutely.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;You let the pages rifle until they stopped?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Absolutely.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;And what were the first words you saw?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Chapter 11.&quot; <br /><br /><hr /><br />Toward the end of the service, the Minister asked, &quot;How many of you have forgiven your enemies?&quot; <br />&nbsp;<br />80% held up their hands. The Minister then repeated his question. All responded this time, except one small elderly Lady. <br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;Mrs. Jones?&quot;; &quot;Are you not willing to forgive your enemies?&quot; <br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;I don&#039;t have any.&quot; She replied, smiling sweetly. <br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;Mrs. Jones, that is very unusual. How old are you?&quot; <br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;Ninety-eight.&quot; she replied. <br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;Oh Mrs. Jones, would you please come down in front and tell us all how a person can live ninety-eight years and not have an enemy in the world?&quot; <br />&nbsp;<br />The little sweetheart of a lady tottered down the aisle, faced the congregation, and said: &quot;I outlived the bitches.&quot;

				Two physicians boarded a flight out of Seattle. One sat in the window seat, the other sat in the middle seat. Just before takeoff, an attorney got on and took the aisle seat next to the two physicians. The attorney kicked off his shoes, wiggled his toes and was settling in when the physician in the window seat said, &quot;I think I&#039;ll get up and get a coke.&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;No problem,&quot; said the attorney, &quot;I&#039;ll get it for you.&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While he was gone, one of the physicians picked up the attorney&#039;s shoe and put a thumbtack in it. When he returned with the coke, the other physician said, &quot;That looks good, I think I&#039;ll have one too.&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Again, the attorney obligingly went to fetch it and while he was gone, the other physician picked up the other shoe and put a tack in it. The attorney returned and they all sat back and enjoyed the flight.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As the plane was landing, the attorney slipped his feet into his shoes and knew immediately what had happened.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;How long must this go on?&quot; he asked. &quot;This fighting between our professions?

				Three guys die together in an accident and go to heaven. When they get there, St. Peter says, &quot;We only have one rule here in heaven...don&#039;t step on the ducks.&quot; <br /><br />So they enter heaven, and sure enough, there are ducks all over the place. It is almost impossible not to step on a duck, and although they try their best to avoid them, the first guy accidentally steps on one. <br /><br />Along comes St. Peter with the ugliest woman he ever saw. St. Peter chains them together and says &quot;Your punishment for stepping on a duck is to spend eternity chained to this ugly woman!&quot; <br /><br />The next day, the second guy steps accidentally on a duck, and along comes St. Peter , who doesn&#039;t miss a thing, and with him is another extremely ugly woman. He chains them together with the same admonishment as for the first guy. <br /><br />The third guy has observed all this and not wanting to be chained for all eternity to an ugly woman, is very, VERY careful where he steps. He manages to go months without stepping on any ducks, but one day St. Peter comes up to him with the most gorgeous woman he has ever laid eyes on...a very tall, tan, curvaceous, sexy blonde. St. Peter chains them together without saying a word. The guy remarks, &quot;I wonder what I did to deserve being chained to you for all of eternity?&quot; <br /><br />The woman replies, &quot;I don&#039;t know about you but I stepped on a duck&quot;

				<span class="bbc_u">Fun Ways To Order Pizza</span><br /><br />If using a touch-tone, press random numbers while ordering. Ask the person<br />taking the order to stop doing that.<br /><br />Order a Big Mac Extra Value Meal.<br /><br />Terminate the call with, “Remember, we never had this conversation.”<br /><br />Tell them to put the crust on top this time.<br /><br />Stutter on the letter “p.”<br /><br />Ask what the order taker is wearing.<br /><br />Say hello, act stunned for five seconds, then behave as if they called you.<br /><br />Change your accent every three seconds.<br /><br />Ask if you get to keep the pizza box. When they say yes, heave a sigh of<br />relief.<br /><br />Put the accent on the last syllable of “pepperoni.” Use the long “i” sound.<br /><br />Say “Are you sure this is Rizzo&#039;s? When they say yes, say “Well, so is<br />this! You’ve got some explaining to do!” When they finally offer proof that it<br />is, in fact, Rizzo&#039;s, start to cry and ask, “Do you know what it’s like to<br />be lied to?”<br /><br />Tell them to double-check to make sure your pizza is, in fact, dead.<br /><br />Order two toppings, then say, “No, they’ll start fighting.”<br /><br />Wonder aloud if you should trim those nose hairs.<br /><br />Make the first topping you order mushrooms. Make the last thing you say “No<br />mushrooms, please.” Hang up before they have a chance to respond.<br />When the order is repeated, change it slightly. When it is repeated again,<br />change it again. On the third time, say, “You just don’t get it, do you?”<br /><br />Order a one-inch pizza.<br /><br />Dance all around the word “pizza.” Avoid saying it at all costs. If he/she<br />says it, say, “Please don’t mention that word.”<br /><br />Order a steamed pizza.<br /><br />If any of the above practices are rejected by the order taker, Say, in your<br />best potty voice, “Last guy let me do it.”<br />

				Four Jewish brothers left home for college. They became successful doctors, and lawyers and prospered. Some years later, they chatted after having dinner together. They discussed the gifts that they were able to give to their elderly mother who lived far away in another city. The first said, &quot;I had a big house built for Mama.&quot; The second said, &quot;I had a hundred thousand dollar theater built in the house.&quot; The third said, &quot;I had my Mercedes dealer deliver her an SL600 with chauffeur.&quot;<br /><br />The fourth said, &quot;Listen to this. You know how Mama loved reading the Torah. And you know, too, she can&#039;t read anymore because she can&#039;t see very well. I met this Rabbi who told me about a parrot that can recite the entire Torah. It took twenty rabbis 12 years to teach him. I had to pledge to contribute $100,000 a year for 20 years to the temple. Let me tell you . . . it was worth it. All Mama has to do is name a chapter and verse and the parrot will recite it.&quot;<br /><br />The other brothers were impressed.<br /><br />After the holidays Mom sent out her Thank You notes.<br /><br />She wrote:<br /><br />Milton, The house you built is so huge. I live in only one room, but I have to clean the whole house. Thanks anyway.<br /><br />Marvin, I am too old to travel. I stay home, I have my groceries delivered, so I never use the Mercedes...and the driver you hired is a Nazi. The thought was good. Thanks.<br /><br />Menachim, you give me an expensive theater with Dolby sound, it could hold 50 people, but all my friends are dead, I&#039;ve lost my hearing and I&#039;m nearly blind. I&#039;ll never use it. Thank you for the gesture just the same.<br /><br />Dearest Melvin, you were the only son to have the good sense to give a little thought to your gift. The chicken was delicious. Thank you.<br /><br /><hr /><br />It was a sweltering August day when the Greenberg brothers entered the posh Michigan, offices of the a notorious car maker. Hyman Greenberg, the eldest of the three, announced, &quot;We have a remarkable invention that will revolutionize the automobile industry.&quot; The car maker looked skeptical, but their threats to offer it to the competition kept his interest piqued. Hi Greenberg continued, &quot;We would like to demonstrate it to you in person.&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />After a little cajoling, they brought the car maker outside and asked him to enter a black car that was parked in front of the building. Norman Greenberg, the middle brother, opened the door of the car. &quot;Please, step inside.&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;What!?&quot; shouted the tycoon. &quot;Are you crazy? It must be one hundred degrees in that car!&quot;<br /><br />&quot;It is,&quot; smiled the youngest brother, Max, &quot;but sit down and push the white button.&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />Intrigued, the tycoon pushed the button. All of a sudden a whoosh of freezing air started blowing from vents all around the car, and within seconds the automobile was not only comfortable, it was quite cool!<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;This is amazing!&quot; exclaimed the tycoon. &quot;How much do you want for the patent?&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />Norman spoke up, &quot;The price is one million dollars.&quot; Then he paused. &quot;And there is something else. We want the name &#039;Greenberg Brothers Air Conditioning&#039; to be stamped right next to your logo.&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;Money is no problem,&quot; the car maker said, &quot;but no way will I have a Jewish name next to my logo on my cars!&quot; They haggled back and forth for awhile and finally they settled. One and one-half million dollars, and the name Greenberg would be left off. However, the first names of the Greenberg brothers would be forever emblazoned upon the console of every air conditioning system. And that is why today, whenever you enter a vehicle, you will see those three names clearly defined on the air-conditioning control panel: NORM - HI - MAX! <br /><br /><hr /><br />One day G-d called the Pope, and He said, &quot;I have good news and bad news. First the good news. I am tired of all the squabbling between the religions on earth. I have decided there will be only the one true religion.&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />The Pope was overjoyed and told G-d how wise His decision was, then asked, &quot;What&#039;s the bad news?&quot;.<br />G-d said, &quot;The bad news is that I am calling from Jerusalem.&quot;<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				There was a man who lost one of his arms in an<br />accident. He became very depressed because he<br />had loved to play Golf and do lots of things that took<br />two arms.<br /><br />One day in his despair, he decided to commit suicide.<br />He got on an elevator and went to the top of a building<br />to jump off. He was standing on the ledge looking down<br />and saw this man skipping along, whistling and kicking<br />up his heels.<br /><br />He looked closer and saw that this man did not have any<br />arms at all. He started thinking, what am I doing up here<br />feeling sorry for myself, I still have one good arm to do<br />things with. There goes a man with no arms skipping<br />down the sidewalk so happy, and going on with his life.<br /><br />He hurried down and caught up with the man with no<br />arms. He told him how glad he was to see him because<br />he had lost one of his arms and felt ugly and useless<br />and was going to kill himself. He thanked him again for<br />saving his life and he knew he could make it with one<br />arm if that guy could go on with no arms.<br /><br />The man with no arms began dancing, whistling, and<br />kicking up his heels again.<br /><br />He asked, &quot;Why are you so happy anyway?&quot;<br /><br />He said, &quot;I am NOT happy. My balls itch!&quot;<br /><br /><hr /><br />Indian Chief &#039;Two Eagles&#039; was asked by a white U.S. government official, &quot;You have observed the white man for 90 years. You&#039;ve seen his wars and his technological advances. You&#039;ve seen his progress, and the damage he&#039;s done.&quot;<br /><br />The Chief nodded in agreement.<br /><br />The official continued, &quot;Considering all these events, in your opinion, where did the white man go wrong?&quot;<br /><br />The Chief stared at the government official for over a minute and then calmly replied: &quot;When white man find land, Indians running it, no taxes, no debt, plenty buffalo, plenty beaver, clean water. Women did all the work, Medicine Man free. Indian man spend all day hunting and fishing; all night having sex.&quot;<br /><br />Then the chief leaned back and smiled, &quot;Only white man dumb enough to think he could improve system like that.&quot;<br /><br />

				A cargo plane is in mid-flight over the ocean when<br />suddenly the cockpit door burst open to reveal an<br />armed, masked hijacker to a startled pilot, copilot,<br />navigator, and a stewardess. He held a gun to the<br />pilot&#039;s head and said, &quot;Take this plane to Iraq or I<br />am going to spill your brains all over the place.&quot;<br /><br />The pilot calmly reached up, pushed the gun aside<br />and said, &quot;Look buddy, if you shoot me this plane will<br />crash right into the sea and you will die along with<br />the rest of us.&quot;<br /><br />The hijacker thought about it, then held the gun to<br />the copilot&#039;s head and said, &quot;Take this plane to Iraq<br />or I am going to spill HIS brains all over the place.&quot;<br /><br />The copilot also calmly reached up, pushed the gun<br />aside and said, &quot;Listen to me. The pilot has a bad<br />heart and he could keel over at the shock of my being<br />killed. So if you shoot me, this plane will still crash right<br />into the sea and you will die along with the rest of us.&quot;<br /><br />The hijacker thought about it for a moment and then<br />held the gun to the navigator&#039;s head and repeated,<br />&quot;Take this plane to Iraq or I am going to spill HIS<br />brains all over the place.&quot;<br /><br />The navigator calmly reached up, pushed the gun aside<br />and said, &quot;I would not do that if I were you. Those other<br />two guys have no sense of direction. Without me, they<br />could not find their way out of a paper bag much less<br />get this plane to Iraq. So if you shoot me, this plane will<br />still crash right into the sea and you will die along with<br />the rest of us.&quot;<br /><br />The hijacker thought some more, shrugged and this time<br />held the gun to the stewardess&#039;s head and demanded,<br />&quot;Take this plane to Iraq or I am going to spill HER brains<br />all over the place.&quot;<br /><br />No one said a word, but the stewardess leaned over and<br />whispered something into the hijacker&#039;s ear. He turned<br />beet red, dropped his gun, and ran out of the cockpit in<br />a panic.<br /><br />The crew tracked down the hijacker, who was found<br />cowering behind some crates in the hold, and tied him<br />up. The pilot then asked the stewardess what she said<br />that terrified the man so.<br /><br />&quot;I told him,&quot; she replied, &quot;that if he killed me, he would<br />be the one who would have to give you guys your blow<br />jobs.&quot;

				A man met a beautiful lady and he decided he wanted to marry her right away. She said, &quot;But we don&#039;t know anything about each other.&quot; He said, &quot;That&#039;s all right, we&#039;ll learn about each other as we go along.&quot; So she consented, and they were married, and went on a honeymoon to a very nice resort. <br /><br />So one morning they were lying by the pool, when he got up off of his towel, climbed up to the 10 Meter board and did a two and a half-tuck gainer, this was followed by a three rotations in jackknife position, where he straightened out and cut the water like a knife. After a few more demonstrations, he came back and lay down on the towel. <br /><br />She said, &quot;That was incredible!&quot; <br /><br />He said, &quot;I used to be an Olympic diving champion. You see, I told you we&#039;d learn more about each other as we went along.&quot; <br /><br />So she got up, jumped in the pool, and started doing laps. After about thirty laps she climbed back out and lay down on her towel hardly out of breath. <br /><br />He said, &quot;That was incredible! Were you an Olympic endurance swimmer?&quot; <br /><br />&quot;No,&quot; she said. &quot;I was a hooker in Venice and I worked both sides of the Grand Canal.&quot;

				A woman was at her hairdresser&#039;s getting her hair styled <br />for a trip to Rome with her husband. <br />She mentioned the trip to the hairdresser, <br />who responded: <br /><br />&quot;Rome? Why would anyone want to go there? <br />It&#039;s crowded and dirty. <br />You&#039;re crazy to go to Rome. So, how are you getting there?&quot; <br /><br />&quot;We&#039;re taking Continental,&quot; was the reply. &quot;We got a great rate!&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Continental?&quot; exclaimed the hairdresser. &quot;That&#039;s a terrible airline. <br />Their planes are old, their flight attendants are ugly, and they&#039;re always <br />late. <br /><br />So, where are you staying in Rome?&quot; <br /><br />&quot;We&#039;ll be at this exclusive little place over on Rome&#039;s Tiber River called <br />Teste.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Don&#039;t go any further. I know that place. <br />Everybody thinks its gonna be something special and exclusive, <br />but it&#039;s really a dump, the worst hotel in the city! <br />The rooms are small, the service is surly, and they&#039;re overpriced. <br /><br />So, whatcha&#039; doing when you get there?&quot; <br /><br />&quot;We&#039;re going to go to see the Vatican and we hope to see the Pope.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;That&#039;s rich,&quot; laughed the hairdresser. <br />&quot;You and a million other people trying to see him. <br />He&#039;ll look the size of an ant. <br />Boy, good luck on this lousy trip of yours. You&#039;re going to need it.&quot; <br /><br />A month later, the woman again came in for a hairdo. <br />The hairdresser asked her about her trip to Rome. <br /><br />&quot;It was wonderful,&quot; explained the woman, <br />&quot;not only were we on time in one of Continental&#039;s brand new planes, <br />but it was overbooked, and they bumped us up to first class. <br />The food and wine were wonderful, <br />and I had a handsome 28-year-old steward <br />who waited on me hand and foot. <br />And the hotel was great! They&#039;d just finished a $5 million remodeling job, <br />and now it&#039;s a jewel, the finest hotel in the city. <br />They, too, were overbooked, so they apologized <br />and gave us their owner&#039;s suite at no extra charge!&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Well,&quot; muttered the hairdresser, &quot;that&#039;s all well and good, <br />but I know you didn&#039;t get to see the Pope.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Actually, we were quite lucky, because as we toured the Vatican, <br />a Swiss Guard tapped me on the shoulder, <br />and explained that the Pope likes to meet some of the visitors, <br />and if I&#039;d be so kind as to step into his private room and wait, <br />the Pope would personally greet me. <br />Sure enough, five minutes later, <br />the Pope walked through the door and shook my hand! <br />I knelt down and he spoke a few words to me.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Oh, really! What&#039;d he say?&quot; <br /><br />He said: <br /><br />&quot;Where&#039;d you get the poopie Hairdo?<br />

				An old woman is riding in an elevator in a very lavish New York City Building, when a young and beautiful woman gets into the elevator, smelling of expensive perfume. She turns to the old woman and says arrogantly, &quot;Romance&quot; by Ralph Lauren, $150 an ounce!&quot; <br /><br />Then another young and beautiful woman gets on the elevator, and also very arrogantly turns to the old woman saying, &quot;Chanel No. 5, $200 an ounce!&quot; <br /><br />About three floors later, the old woman has reached her destination and is about to get off the elevator. Before she leaves, she looks both beautiful women in the eye, then bends over, farts and says... <br />&quot;Broccoli. 49 cents a pound!&quot;

				When Apollo Mission Astronaut Neil Armstrong first walked on the moon, he not only made his famous &quot;One Small Step for Man, One Giant Leap for Mankind&quot; statement, but followed it by several remarks--usual com traffic between him, the other astronauts and Mission Control. Before he re-entered the lander, he made the enigmatic remark, &quot;Good luck, Mr. Gorsky.&quot;<br /><br />Many people at NASA thought it was a casual remark concerning some rival Soviet Cosmonaut; however, upon checking, there was no Gorsky in either the Russian nor American space programs.<br /><br />Over the years, many people have questioned him as to what the &quot;Good luck, Mr. Gorsky&quot; statement meant.<br /><br />On July 5, 1995 in Tampa Bay, FL, while answering questions following a speech, a reporter brought up the 26 year old question to Armstrong. He finally responded. It seems that Mr. Gorsky had died and so Armstrong felt he could answer the question.<br /><br />When he was a kid, Neil was playing baseball with his brother in the backyard. His brother hit a fly ball which landed in front of his neighbors&#039; bedroom window. The neighbors were Mr. and Mrs. Gorksy. As he leaned down to pick up the ball, he heard Mrs. Gorsky shouting at Mr. Gorsky, &quot;Oral sex? Oral sex you want? You&#039;ll get oral sex . . . when the kid next door walks on the moon!&quot;<br /><br /><hr /><br />Two confirmed bachelors were sitting and talking. Their conversation drifted from politics to cooking. &quot;I got a cookbook once,&quot; said the first &quot;but I could never do anything with it.&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;Too much fancy cooking in it, eh?&quot; asked the second.<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;You said it. Every one of the recipes began the same way—&#039;Take a clean dish and . . . &#039;&quot;

				A woman came home just in time to find her husband in bed with another woman. <br /><br />With superhuman strength borne of fury, she dragged her husband down the stairs to the garage and put his manhood in a vice. She then secured it tightly and removed the handle.<br /><br />Next she picked up a hacksaw.<br /><br />The husband terrified, screamed, &quot;Stop! Stop! You&#039;re not going to cut it off are you?&quot;<br /><br />The wife, with a gleam of revenge in her eye, said, &quot;Nope. You are. I&#039;m going to set the garage on fire.&quot;<br />

				A man walks into a restaurant with a full-grown ostrich behind him. The waitress asks for their orders. The man says, &quot;A hamburger, fries and a coke,&quot; and turns to the ostrich, &quot;What&#039;s yours?&quot; <br /><br />&quot;I&#039;ll have the same,&quot; says the ostrich. <br /><br />A short time later the waitress returns with the order. &quot;That will be $9.40 please,&quot; and the man reaches into his pocket and pulls out the exact change for payment. <br /><br />The next day, the man and the ostrich come again and the man says, &quot;A hamburger, fries, and a coke.&quot; The ostrich says, &quot;I&#039;ll have the same.&quot; <br /><br />Again the man reaches into his pocket and pays with exact change. This becomes routine until, the two enter again. <br /><br />&quot;The usual?&quot; asks the waitress. &quot;No, this is Friday night, so I will have a steak, baked potato, and salad,&quot; says the man. &quot;Same,&quot; says the ostrich. <br /><br />Shortly the waitress brings the order and says, &quot;That will be $32.62.&quot; Once again the man pulls the exact change out of his pocket and places it on the table. The waitress can&#039;t hold back her curiosity any longer. &quot;Excuse me, sir. How do you manage to always come up with the exact change out of your pocket every time?&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Well,&quot; says the man, &quot;several years ago I was cleaning the attic and found an old lamp. When I rubbed it a Genie appeared and offered me two wishes. My first wish was that if I ever had to pay for anything, I would just put my hand in my pocket and the right amount of money would always be there.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;That&#039;s brilliant!&quot; says the waitress. &quot;Most people would wish for a million dollars or something, but you&#039;ll always be as rich as you want for as long as you live!&quot; <br /><br />&quot;That&#039;s right. Whether it&#039;s a gallon of milk or a Rolls Royce, the exact money is always there,&quot; says the man. <br /><br />The waitress asks, &quot;But, sir, what&#039;s with the ostrich?&quot; <br /><br />The man sighs, pauses, and answers, &quot;My second wish was for a tall chick with a big ass and long legs who agrees with everything I say.&quot;

				A wealthy old lady decides to go on a photo safari in Africa, taking her faithful aged poodle named Cuddles, along for the company.<br /><br />One day the poodle starts chasing butterflies and before long, Cuddles discovers that he&#039;s lost. Wandering about, he notices a leopard heading rapidly in his direction with the intention of having lunch.<br /><br />The old poodle thinks, &#039;Oh, oh! I&#039;m in deep doo-doo now!&#039; Noticing some bones on the ground close by, he immediately settles down to chew on the bones with his back to the approaching cat. Just as the leopard is about to leap the old poodle exclaims loudly, &#039;Boy, that was one delicious leopard!&nbsp; I wonder if there are any more around here?&#039;<br /><br />Hearing this, the young leopard halts his attack in mid-strike, a look of terror comes over him and he slinks away into the trees. &#039;Whew!&#039; says the leopard, &#039;That was close! That old poodle nearly had me!&#039;<br /><br />Meanwhile, a monkey who had been watching the whole scene from a nearby tree, figures he can put this knowledge to good use and trade it for protection from the leopard. So off he goes, but the old poodle sees him heading after the leopard with great speed, and figures that something must be up. The monkey soon catches up with the leopard, spills the beans and strikes a deal for himself with the leopard.<br /><br />The young leopard is furious at being made a fool of and says, &#039;Here, monkey, hop on my back and see what&#039;s going to happen to that conniving canine!<br /><br />Now, the old poodle sees the leopard coming with the monkey on his back and thinks, &#039;What am I going to do now?&#039;, but instead of running, the dog sits down with his back to his attackers, pretending he hasn&#039;t seen them yet, and just when they get close enough to hear, the old poodle says.<br /><br />&#039;Where&#039;s that damn monkey? I sent him off an hour ago to bring me another leopard!<br /><br />Moral of this story....<br /><br />Don&#039;t mess with old farts .. age and treachery will always overcome youth and skill!<br />Bullshit and brilliance only come with age and experience.

The poor girl&#039;s face turned bright red and,<br />as she realized exactly what she had inadvertently<br />said (or rather implied), she picked up her things<br />without a word and walked out of class, never to<br />return.<br /><br />However, as she was going out the door, the<br />professor&#039;s reply was classic.

				<br />An elderly woman was looking for a pet to be a good companion and not much trouble. <br /><br />The pet store owner suggested a parrot, showed it to her and guaranteed her it would be a wonderful companion. <br /><br />The woman asked if it would behave if she took it to church with her on Sundays. <br /><br />The owner said it shouldn&#039;t be a problem and that she could put him on her shoulder and he would stay there. <br /><br />She bought the parrot and for the next week spent time getting to know him. <br /><br />Assured that he spoke properly and was well behaved, she put him on her shoulder and went off to church. <br /><br />Just as everyone quieted down and the sermon began, the parrot looked around, squawked and said, &quot;It&#039;s goddamned cold in here!&quot; <br /><br />Everyone turned to look at her and she ran out of the church in total embarrassment! All the next week, she talked to the parrot explaining the necessity to remain quiet during church. <br /><br />The parrot understood so she put him on her shoulder and went to church the following Sunday. <br /><br />Once again, just as everything got quiet and the sermon began,the parrot squawked, looked around and loudly proclaimed, &quot;It&#039;s goddamned cold in here!!&quot; <br /><br />And again the woman ran from the church. The next day she returned to the pet store and explained the embarrassing situation to the owner. <br /><br />Since she didn&#039;t want to get rid of the parrot, the owner offered the following solution: <br /><br />If the parrot does that again, grab him by the legs and swing him around 5 or 6 times and return him to your shoulder.&quot; &quot;That&#039;ll work?&quot; asked the woman. &quot;Guaranteed!&quot; exclaimed the owner. <br /><br />So, the next Sunday she took the parrot to church and, sure enough, just as the sermon started, the parrot squawked, &quot;It&#039;s goddamned cold in here!!&quot; Without any hesitation, the woman grabbed his legs, swung him around 5 or 6 times and placed him back on her shoulder. <br /><br />The parrot shook his head, ruffled his feathers and said, &quot;Pretty fuckin&#039; windy, too!&quot;

				If God had created Eve first, what might have<br />transpired: After three weeks in the garden, G~d<br />came to visit Eve.<br /><br />&quot;How are things, Eve?&quot;, He asked.<br /><br />&quot;It is all so beautiful, G~d,&quot; she replied, &quot;The sunrises<br />and sunsets are breathtaking, the smells, the sights,<br />everything is wonderful. But I just have this one problem.<br />It&#039;s these breasts you&#039;ve given me. The middle one<br />pushes the other two out, and I am constantly knocking<br />them with my arms, catching them on branches, snagging<br />them on bushes, they&#039;re a real pain.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;That&#039;s a fair point,&quot; replied G~d, &quot;but it was my first shot<br />at this, you know.

Why are<br />you baring your breasts for everyone to see when<br />we are about to die!&quot;<br /><br />Cindy responds: &quot;I have it on good authority in plane<br />crashes, the rescue workers look to save first the<br />women with big beautiful breasts -- which is why I<br />am exposing my teeth!&quot;<br /><br />Not hesitating, Naomi Campbell pulls down her skirt<br />and panties to expose her love triangle.&quot;<br /><br />Freaking out, Claudia and Cindy yell: &quot;Naomi -- Are<br />you crazy?? Why are you exposing your crotch for<br />everyone to see?&quot;<br /><br />Calmly, Naomi responds: &quot;BITCHES PLEASE! I know<br />for a fact the first thing the rescue workers look for<br />in plane crashes is a black box!&quot;<br />

				Bungee-Jumping in Mexico <br /><br />Two guys are bungee-jumping one day. The first guy says to the second. &quot;You know, we could make a lot of money running our own bungee-jumping service in Mexico.&quot; The second guy thinks this is a great idea, so the two pool their money and buy everything they&#039;ll need - a tower, an elastic cord, insurance, etc. <br /><br />They travel to Mexico and begin to set up on the square. As they are constructing the tower, a crowd begins to assemble. Slowly, more and more people gather to watch them at work. The first guy jumps. He bounces at the end of the cord, but when he comes back up, the second guy notices that he has a few cuts and scratches. <br /><br />Unfortunately, the second guy isn&#039;t able to catch him, he falls again, bounces and comes back up again. This time, he is bruised and bleeding. Again, the second guy wasn&#039;t able to catch him. <br /><br />The first guy falls again and bounces back up. This time, he comes back pretty messed up - he&#039;s got a couple of broken bones and is almost unconscious. Luckily, the second guy finally catches him this time and says, &quot;What happened? Was the cord too long?&quot; <br /><br />The first guy says, &quot;No, the cord was fine, but what the heck is a &#039;pinata&#039;?&quot; <br />

				A guy complains to his doctor that his sex life<br />is deteriorating rapidly.<br /><br />The doctor tells him he needs to reintroduce<br />excitement, guilt and so on into the process.<br />He ponders this for a few days and hatches<br />a plan.<br /><br />&quot;Well,&quot; he says to the doctor a week ago, &quot;I did<br />everything you suggested. The boss let me leave<br />work an hour early. I sped home and I skidded<br />all the way up the driveway.

				Yesterday I was buying 2 large bags of Purina dog chow at Wal-Mart, for my <br />&nbsp;dogs Winston, Chief, Gus and Maximus. I was about to check out when a woman <br />&nbsp;behind me asked if I had a dog. What did she think that I had an elephant? <br />&nbsp;Since I had little else to do, on impulse, I told her that no, I didn&#039;t have<br />&nbsp;a dog, and that I was starting the Purina Diet again, although I probably <br />&nbsp;shouldn&#039;t because I ended up in the hospital last time. On the bright side <br />&nbsp;though, I&#039;d lost 50 pounds before I awakened in an intensive care ward with <br />&nbsp;tubes coming out of every hole in my body and IVs in both arms. <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;I told her that it was essentially a perfect diet and that the way that it <br />&nbsp;works is to load your pockets with Purina nuggets and simply eat one or two <br />&nbsp;every time you feel hungry and that the food is nutritionally complete so I<br />&nbsp;was&nbsp; going to try it again. (I have to mention here that practically everyone in<br />&nbsp;the line was enthralled with my story by now.) <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Horrified, she asked if I ended up in intensive care because the dog food<br />&nbsp;had poisoned me. I told her no; I had stopped in the middle of the parking lot<br />&nbsp;to lick my butt and a car hit me.

Fortunately, it<br />is not too bad and I really did not get hurt, so please<br />do not worry too much about me.<br /><br />I was coming home from Wal-Mart, and when I turned<br />into the driveway, I accidentally pushed down on the<br />accelerator instead of the brake. The garage door is<br />slightly bent but the pick up fortunately came to a halt<br />when it bumped into your car.<br /><br />I am really sorry, but I know with your kindhearted<br />personality you will forgive me. You know how much<br />I love you and care for you my sweetheart. I am<br />enclosing a picture for you.<br /><br />I cannot wait to hold you in my arms again.<br /><br />Your loving wife,<br />Bonita<br /><br />(http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3320/3633142282_a4314ea40d_o.jpg)<br /><br />P.S.: Your girlfriend called.<br />

I WON, I WON!&#039;<br /><br />She hugged each of the dealers and then picked<br />up her winnings and her clothes and quickly<br />departed.<br /><br />The dealers stared at each other dumbfounded.<br /><br />Finally, one of them asked, &#039;What did she roll?&#039;<br /><br />The other answered, &#039;I don&#039;t know - I thought<br />you were watching.&#039;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Moral Of The Story:<br />Not all Irish are drunks,<br />Not all blondes are dumb.<br /><br />

My favorite thing!<br /><br />------------------------------------------<br /><br />The Cat&#039;s Diary:<br /><br />Day 983 of my captivity.<br /><br />My captors continue to taunt me with bizarre little dangling objects. They dine lavishly on fresh meat, while the other inmates and I are fed some sort of dry nuggets. Although I make my contempt for the rations perfectly clear, I nevertheless must eat something in order to keep up my strength. The only thing that keeps me going is my dream of escape. In an attempt to disgust them, I once again vomit on the carpet. Today I decapitated a mouse and dropped its headless body at their feet. I had hoped this would strike fear into their hearts, since it clearly demonstrates my capabilities. However, they merely made condescending comments about what a &quot;good little hunter&quot; I am. Jerks!<br /><br />There was some sort of assembly of their accomplices tonight. I was placed in solitary confinement for the duration of the event. However, I could hear the noises and smell the food. I overheard that my confinement was due to the power of &quot;allergies.&quot; I must learn what this means, and how to use it to my advantage. Today I was almost successful in an attempt to assassinate one of my tormentors by weaving around his feet as he was walking. I must try this again tomorrow, but at the top of the stairs.<br /><br />I am convinced that the other prisoners here are flunkies and snitches. The dog receives special privileges. He is regularly released, and seems to be more than willing to return. He is obviously retarded. The bird must be an informant. I observe him communicate with the guards regularly. I am certain that he reports my every move. My captors have arranged protective custody for him in an elevated cell, so he is safe. For now.<br />

				Two doctors were in a hospital hallway one day<br />complaining about Nurse Jenny.&nbsp; &quot;She&#039;s incredibly<br />dumb. She does everything absolutely backwards.&quot;<br />said one doctor. &quot;Just last week, I told her to give a<br />patient 2 milligrams of Percocet every 10 hours. She<br />gave him 10 milligrams every 2 hours. He nearly<br />died on us!&quot;<br /><br />The second doctor said, &quot;That&#039;s nothing. Earlier this<br />week, I told her to give a patient an enema every 12<br />hours. She tried to give him 12 enemas in one hour!<br />The guy nearly exploded!&quot;<br /><br />Suddenly, they hear a blood-curdling scream from<br />down the hall, &quot;Oh my G=d!&quot; said the first doctor, &quot;I<br />just realized I told Nurse Jenny to prick Mr. Smith&#039;s<br />boil!&quot;<br />

				An out-of-towner drove his car into a ditch in a desolated area. Luckily, a local farmer came to help with his big strong horse named Buddy.<br />He hitched Buddy up to the car and yelled, &quot;Pull, Nellie, pull!&quot; Buddy didn&#039;t move.<br />Then the farmer hollered, &quot;Pull, Buster, pull!&quot; Buddy didn&#039;t respond.<br />Once more the farmer commanded, &quot;Pull, Coco, pull!&quot; Nothing.<br />Then the farmer nonchalantly said, &quot;Pull, Buddy, pull!&quot; And the horse easily dragged the car out of the ditch.<br />The motorist was most appreciative and very curious. He asked the farmer why he called his horse by the wrong name three times.<br />The farmer said, &quot;Oh, Buddy is blind and if he thought he was the only one pulling, he wouldn&#039;t even try!&quot;<br />

				Guts or balls?&nbsp; There is a medical distinction. We&#039;ve all heard about people having guts or balls, but do you really know the difference between them? In an effort to keep you informed, the definitions are listed below:<br /><br />GUTS: Is arriving home late after a night out with the guys, being met by your wife with a broom, and having the guts to ask: &#039;Are you still cleaning, or are you flying somewhere?&#039;<br /><br />BALLS: Is coming home late after a night out with the guys, smelling of perfume and beer, lipstick on your collar, slapping your wife on the butt and having the balls to say: You&#039;re next, Chubby...&#039;<br /><br />I hope this clears up any confusion on the definitions. <br /><br /><br />Medically speaking there is no difference in the outcome.&nbsp; <br /><br />Both result in death.<br />&nbsp;<br /><hr /><br />An Old Italian lived alone in New Jersey. He wanted to plant his annual tomato garden, but it was very difficult work, as the ground was hard. <br /><br />His only son, Vincent, who used to help him, was in prison.

I&#039;m just getting too old to be digging up a garden plot. I know if you were here my troubles would be over. I know you would be happy to dig the plot for me, like in the old days. <br />Love, Papa </em><br /><br />A few days later he received a letter from his son. <br /><br /><em>Dear Pop,<br />Don&#039;t dig up that garden. That&#039;s where the bodies are buried. <br />Love,<br />Vinnie</em><br /><br />At 4 a.m. The next morning, FBI agents and local police arrived and dug up the entire area without finding any bodies. They apologized to the old man and left. <br /><br />That same day the old man received another letter from his son. <br /><br /><em>Dear Pop,<br />Go ahead and plant the tomatoes now. That&#039;s the best I could do under the circumstances. <br />Love you,<br />Vinnie </em>

				Actual Science Tests Report...<br />These are reputedly real answers to questions on science tests. <br /><br />When you smell an odorless gas, it is probably carbon monoxide. <br /><br />Water is composed of two gins, oxygin and hydrogin. Oxygin is pure gin. Hydrogin is gin and water. <br /><br />Nitrogen is not found in Ireland because it is not found in a free state. <br /><br />When you breathe, you inspire. When you do not breathe, you expire. <br /><br />Three kinds of blood vessels are arteries, vanes, and caterpillars. <br /><br />Before giving a blood transfusion, find out if the blood is affirmative or negative. <br /><br />The moon is a planet just like the Earth, only it is even deader. <br /><br />The pistol of a flower is its only protection against insects. <br /><br />A fossil is an extinct animal. The older it is, the more extinct it is. <br /><br />For fainting: Rub the person&#039;s chest, or, if it&#039;s a lady, rub her arm above the hand.

The purpose of the skeleton is so that there is something to hitch the meat to. <br /><br />To remove dust from the eye, pull the eye down over the nose. <br /><br />The body consists of three parts - the brainium, the borax and the abominable cavity.

When the bus starts again, the bus driver says to the hippie, &quot;If you want, I can tell you how you can get that nun to have sex with you.&quot; <br /><br />The hippie of course says that he&#039;d love to know, so the bus driver tells him that every Tuesday evening at midnight the nun goes to the cemetery to pray to the lord. &quot;If you went dressed in robes and some glowing powder,&quot; says the bus driver, &quot;You could tell her you were God and command her to have sex with you.&quot; <br /><br />The hippie decides to try this out. That Tuesday, he goes to the cemetery and waits for the nun. Right on schedule, the nun shows up.

The hippie agrees to this and quickly sets about having sex with the nun. <br /><br />After the hippie finishes, he rips off his mask and shouts out, &quot;Ha ha, I&#039;m the hippie! &quot; <br /><br />The nun replies by whipping off her mask and shouting, &quot;Ha ha, I&#039;m the bus driver!&quot;

				Never underestimate A Texas Redneck Cowboy<br /><br />A Redneck from Sweetwater, Texas walked into a bank in New York City and asked for the loan officer. He told the loan officer that he was going to Paris on an international redneck festival for two weeks and needed to borrow $5,000 and that he was not a depositor of the bank. the bank officer told him that the bank would need some form of security for the loan, so the redneck handed over the keys to a new Ferrari. The car was parked on the street in front of the bank. The redneck produced the title and everything checked out. The loan officer agreed to hold the car as collateral for the loan and apologized for having to charge 12% interest. later, the bank&#039;s president and its officers all enjoyed a good laugh at the Redneck from the south for using a $250,000 Ferrari as collateral for a $5,000 loan. An employee of the bank then drove the Ferrari into the bank&#039;s private underground garage and parked it.<br /><br />Two weeks later, the Redneck returned, repaid the $5,000 and the interest of $23.07. The loan officer said, &#039;Sir, we are very happy to have had your business, and this transaction has worked out very nicely, but we are a little puzzled. While you were away, we checked you out on Dunn &amp; Bradstreet and found that you are a highly sophisticated investor and multimillionaire with real estate and financial interests all over the world. Your investments include a large number of wind turbines around Sweetwater, Texas. What puzzles us is, why would you bother to borrow $5,000?<br /><br />The good &#039;ole Texas boy replied, &#039;Where else in New York City can I park my car for Two weeks for only $23.07 and expect it to be there when I return?

How about only ten years and I&#039;ll give you back the other ten?&#039;<br /><br />So God agreed..<br /><br />On the second day, God created the monkey and said:<br /><br />&#039;Entertain people, do tricks, and make them laugh. For this, I&#039;ll give you a twenty-year life span.&#039;<br /><br />The monkey said: &#039;Monkey tricks for twenty years? That&#039;s a pretty long time to perform. How about I give you back ten like the Dog did?&#039;<br /><br />And God agreed.<br /><br />On the third day, God created the cow and said:<br /><br />&#039;You must go into the field with the farmer all day long and suffer under the sun, have calves and give milk to support the farmer&#039;s family. For this, I will give you a life span of sixty years.&#039;<br /><br />The cow said: &#039;That&#039;s kind of a tough life you want me to live for sixty years... How about twenty and I&#039;ll give back the other forty?&#039;<br /><br />And God agreed again.<br /><br />On the fourth day, God created humans and said:<br /><br />&#039;Eat, sleep, play, marry and enjoy your life. For this, I&#039;ll give you twenty years.&#039;<br /><br />But the human said: &#039;Only twenty years? Could you possibly give me my twenty, the forty the cow gave back, the ten the monkey gave back, and the ten the dog gave back; that makes eighty, okay?&#039;<br /><br />&#039;Okay,&#039; said God, &#039;You asked for it.&#039;<br /><br />So that is why for our first twenty years we eat, sleep, play and enjoy ourselves. For the next forty years we slave in the sun to support our family. For the next ten years we do monkey tricks to entertain the grandchildren.

Every day a young man would leave his office building at lunch time, and as he passed the pretzel&nbsp; stand, he would leave her a quarter, but never take a&nbsp; pretzel.<br /><br />This went on for more than 3 years. The two of&nbsp; them never spoke. One day, as the young man passed the old&nbsp; lady&#039;s stand and left his quarter as usual, the pretzel lady&nbsp; spoke to him.&nbsp; Without blinking an eye she said:&nbsp; <br /><br />&quot;They&#039;re 35 cents now.&quot;<br />

				A woman was in town on a shopping trip.<br />&nbsp; <br />She began her day finding the most perfect shoes in the first shop and a beautiful dress on sale in the second. In the third, everything had just been reduced by 50 percent when her mobile phone rang.<br />&nbsp; <br />It was a female doctor notifying her that her husband had just been in a terrible car accident and was in critical condition and in the ICU. The woman told the doctor to inform her husband where she was and that she&#039;d be there as soon as possible. As she hung up she realized she was leaving what was shaping up to be her best day ever in the boutiques. She decided to get in a couple of more shops before heading to the hospital.<br />&nbsp; <br />She ended up shopping the rest of the morning, finishing her trip with a cup of coffee and a beautiful chocolate cake slice, compliments of the last shop. She was jubilant.<br />&nbsp; <br />Then she remembered her husband.<br />&nbsp; <br />Feeling guilty, she dashed to the hospital. She saw the doctor in the corridor and asked about her husband&#039;s condition.<br />&nbsp; <br />The lady doctor glared at her and shouted, &#039;You went ahead and finished your shopping trip, didn&#039;t you! I hope you&#039;re proud of yourself! While you were out for the past four hours enjoying yourself in town, your husband has been languishing in the Intensive Care Unit! It&#039;s just as well you went ahead and finished, because it will more than likely be the last shopping trip you ever take! For the rest of his life he will require round-the-clock care. And he will now be your career!&#039; The&nbsp; woman was feeling so guilty, she broke down and sobbed.<br />&nbsp; <br />The lady doctor then chuckled and said, &#039;I&#039;m just pulling your leg. He&#039;s dead. Show me what you bought.

				There was a guy who had been having chronic trouble in trying to get an erection. After weeks of frustration, he finally breaks down and and goes to the doctor. The doctor gives him a thorough examination and finally makes the diagnosis. <br /><br />&quot;Well, there&#039;s good news and there&#039;s bad news,&quot; she says. &quot;The bad news is that the muscles around your penis are deteriorating, and there is no cure.&quot; <br /><br />The guy, on the verge of panic, finally regains his composure. &quot;So what&#039;s the good news?&quot; he asks. <br /><br />The doctor says: &quot;There is an experimental treatment available, but there are no guarantees. It involves transplanting the muscles from a baby elephant&#039;s trunk into your penis. Would you like to try it?&quot; <br /><br />The guy thinks about it and finally says, &quot;Well, the thought of going through life without being able to have sex is just too much for me. What have I got to lose? Let&#039;s do it.&quot; <br /><br />So the doctor performs the operation. A few weeks later, the guy takes his girlfriend out to a nice restaurant to celebrate his new equipment. While sitting at the table, he feels a stirring between his legs; it gets progressively worse until it reaches the point of being painful. Seeking relief, he reaches down and unzips his fly to relieve some of the pressure. <br /><br />Suddenly, his penis leaps free from his pants, slides over the tabletop and grabs a dinner roll, then returns to his pants again. <br /><br />&quot;Wow!&quot; says his stunned girlfriend, &quot;That was impressive! Can you do that again?&quot; <br /><br />Eyes watering and face flushed, he says, &quot;Probably ... but I don&#039;t know if I can fit another dinner roll up my ass!&quot;<br />

				John invited his mother over for dinner. During the meal, his mother couldn&#039;t help noticing how handsome John&#039;s roommate was. She had long been suspicious of Johns&#039; sexual orientation and this only made her more curious. <br /><br />Over the course of the evening, while watching the two interact, she started to wonder if there was more between John and the roommate than met the eye. <br /><br />Reading his mom&#039;s thoughts, John volunteered, &quot;I know what you must be thinking, but I assure you, Mark and I are just roommates.&quot; <br /><br />About a week later, Mark came to John and said, &quot;Ever since your mother came to dinner, I&#039;ve been unable to find the beautiful silver gravy ladle. You don&#039;t suppose she took it, do you?&quot; <br /><br />John said, &quot;Well, I doubt it, but I&#039;ll write her a letter just to be sure.&quot; So he sat down and wrote: &quot;Dear Mother, I&#039;m not saying you &#039;did&#039; take a gravy ladle from my house, and I&#039;m not saying you &#039;did not&#039; take a gravy ladle. But the fact remains that one has been missing ever since you were here for dinner.&quot; <br /><br />Several days later, John received a letter from his mother which read: &quot;Dear Son, I&#039;m not saying that you &#039;do&#039; sleep with Mark, and I&#039;m not saying that you &#039;do not&#039; sleep with Mark. But the fact remains that if he was sleeping in his own bed, he would have found the gravy ladle by now. Love, Mom&quot;

				A very elderly couple is having an elegant dinner to celebrate their 75th wedding anniversary. The old man leans forward and says softly to his wife, &quot;Dear, there is something that I must ask you. It has always bothered me that our tenth child never quite looked like the rest of our children. Now I want to assure you that these 75 years have been the most wonderful experience I could have ever hoped for, and your answer cannot take all that away. But, I must know, did he have a different father?&quot; <br /><br />The wife drops her head, unable to look her husband in the <br />eye, she paused for moment and then confessed. &quot;Yes, yes he did.&quot; <br /><br />The old man is very shaken, the reality of what his wife <br />was admitting hit him harder than he had expected. With a tear in his eye he asks &quot;Who?.. Who was he? Who was the father?&quot; <br /><br />Again the old woman drops her head, saying nothing at first <br />as she tried to muster the courage to tell the truth to her husband.

				After three weeks in the Garden of Eden, G-d came to visit Eve. &#039;So, how is everything going?&#039; inquired G-d. <br /><br />&#039;It is all so beautiful, G-d,&#039; she replied. &#039;The sunrises and sunsets are breathtaking, the smells, the sights, everything is wonderful, but I have just one problem. <br /><br />It&#039;s these breasts you have given me. The middle one pushes the other two out and I am constantly knocking them with my arms, catching them on branches and snagging them on bushes. They&#039;re a real pain.&#039; <br /><br />And Eve went on to tell G-d that since many other parts of her body came in pairs, such as her limbs, eyes, ears, etc she felt that having only two breasts might leave her body more &#039;symmetrically balanced&#039;. <br /><br />&#039;That&#039;s a fair point,&#039; replied G-d, &#039;But it was my first shot at this, you know. I gave the animals six breasts, so I figured that you needed only half of those, but I see that you are right. I will fix it up right away.&#039; <br /><br />And G-d reached down, removed the middle breast and tossed it into the bushes <br /><br />Three weeks passed and G-d once again visited Eve in the Garden of Eden. <br /><br />&#039; Well, Eve, how is my favorite creation?&#039; <br /><br />&#039;Just fantastic,&#039; she replied, &#039;But for one oversight. You see, all the animals are paired off. The ewe has a ram and the cow has her bull. All the animals have a mate except me. I feel so alone.&#039; <br /><br />G-d thought for a moment and said, &#039;You know, Eve, you are right. How could I have overlooked this? You do need a mate and I will immediately create a man from a part of you. Let&#039;s see . . . where did I put that useless boob?&#039; <br /><br />Now doesn&#039;t THAT make more sense than the rib story?

				There once was a farmer who was raising three daughters on his own. He was very concerned about their well being and always did his best to watch out for them. As they entered the late teens, the girls dated, and on this particular evening all three of his girls were going out on a date.<br /><br />This was the first time this had occurred. As was his custom, he would greet the young suitor at the door holding his shotgun, not to menace or threaten but merely to ensure that the young man knew who was boss.<br /><br />The doorbell rang and the first of the boys arrived. Father answered the door and the lad said, &quot;Hi, my name&#039;s Joe. I&#039;m here for Flo. We&#039;re going to the show, is she ready to go?&quot; The father looked him over and sent the kids on their way.<br /><br />The next lad arrived and said, &quot;My name&#039;s Eddie. I&#039;m here for Betty. We&#039;re gonna get some spaghetti. Is she ready?&quot; Father felt this one was okay too, so off the two kids went.<br /><br />The final young man arrived and the farmer opened the door.

				Once upon a time there were a horse and a rubber chicken<br />who were good friends. They lived on a farmyard with a lot<br />of other animals and were very happy. One day, while they<br />were playing near the farm&#039;s pond, the horse stepped into<br />a hole of quicksand. The horse rapidly sank and was yelling<br />for his friend, the rubber chicken, to save him.<br /><br />The rubber chicken thought for a minute, then ran away.<br />The rubber chicken ran back to the farmhouse, and jumped<br />into the farmer&#039;s 735csi BMW. Luckily, the keys were in the<br />ignition, and the rubber chicken managed to start the car,<br />and put it in gear.<br /><br />It raced over to the sinkhole, where the horse had almost<br />disappeared by now. The smart rubber chicken tied a rope<br />around the back of the BMW and threw the other end around<br />the front legs of the horse. The rubber chicken hopped back in<br />the driver&#039;s seat and stepped on the gas. Ever so slowly, the<br />horse eased out of the quicksand and jumped to safety. The<br />horse, still on shaky legs, stuttered: &quot;You just saved my life.<br />Thank you!&quot;<br /><br />The rubber chicken just said, &quot;Don&#039;t mention it - That&#039;s what<br />friends are for!!&quot;<br /><br />They returned the BMW and went out to dinner together in<br />the barn yard.<br /><br />A few days later, the horse got up from a good night&#039;s rest,<br />and heard some muffled cries for help coming from the<br />backyard. The horse followed the sounds and came upon a<br />terrible scene. There was his best friend, the rubber<br />chicken, stuck in a hole of quicksand!<br /><br />The sand was already up to its neck-feathers and the cries<br />for help had almost stopped. The horse took a quick look around:<br />No rope in sight And the farmer had gone to town with his BMW.<br />What to do? The horse took a deep breath and spread his body<br />and legs out over the hole. His member was dangling down right<br />above the poor rubber chicken.<br /><br />&quot;Here, my friend, grab my thingy and I will pull you to safety!&quot;<br /><br />With its last bit of energy, the rubber chicken grabbed a hold of<br />the big horse-thingy and the horse straightened its body, pulling<br />the rubber chicken from its trap.<br /><br />With one big step, both were on solid ground and safe. The<br />rubber chicken slumped down on the ground, exhausted:<br />&quot;Now YOU saved my life, my friend!!&quot;<br /><br />The horse just smiled.<br /><br />And what is the moral of this story?&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><strong><span class="bbc_u"><em>If you&#039;re hung like a horse, you don&#039;t need a BMW to pick up chicks.</em></span></strong>

				In 1993, the University of Kentucky did a study to see why the head of<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;a man&#039;s penis was<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;larger than the shaft. After one year and $ 80,000.00, they concluded<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;that the reason the<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;head was larger than the shaft was to give the man more pleasure<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;during sex.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;After the study was published, the University of South Carolina<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;decided to do their own<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;study. After $250,000.00, and 3 years of research, they concluded that<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;the reason was to<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;give the woman more pleasure during sex.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The University of Georgia, unsatisfied with these findings, conducted<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;their own study.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;After 2 weeks and a cost of around $75.46, they concluded that it was<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;to keep a man&#039;s<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;hand from flying off and hitting him in the forehead.<br />

The<br />husband asked the man, &quot;How could sandals make you<br />into a sex freak?&quot;<br /><br />The Pakistani man replied, &quot;Why don&#039;t you try them on<br />and see for yourself?&quot;<br /><br />Well, the husband, after much badgering from his wife,<br />finally conceded to try them on. As soon as he slipped<br />them onto his feet, he got this wild look in his eyes;<br />something his wife hadn&#039;t seen in many years—raw<br />sexual power.<br /><br />In a blink of an eye, the husband rushed the Pakistani<br />man, threw him on a table and started tearing at the<br />guy&#039;s pants.<br /><br />All the time the Pakistani man was screaming, &quot;YOU<br />HAVE THEM ON THE WRONG FEET!

				An airline captain was breaking in a new blonde stewardess. The route they were flying had a layover in another city. Upon their arrival, the captain showed the stewardess the best place for airline personnel to eat, shop and stay overnight.<br /><br />The next morning, as the pilot was preparing the crew for the day&#039;s route, he noticed the new stewardess was missing. He knew which room she was in at the hotel and called her up wondering what happened. She answered the phone, crying, and said she couldn&#039;t get out of her room. &quot;You can&#039;t get out of your room?&quot; the captain asked, &quot;Why not?&quot;<br /><br />The stewardess replied: &quot;There are only three doors in here,&quot; she sobbed, &quot;one is the bathroom, one is the closet, and one has a sign on it that says &#039;Do Not Disturb&#039;!&quot;

				There is a medical distinction between Guts and Balls. <br />&nbsp;<br />We&#039;ve all heard about people having Guts or Balls, but do you really know&nbsp; the difference between them? In an effort to keep you informed, here are the definitions: <br />&nbsp;<br />GUTS - Is arriving home late after a night out with the guys, being met by your wife with a broom, and having the Guts to ask: &#039;Are you still cleaning,&nbsp; or, are you flying somewhere?&#039; <br />&nbsp;<br />BALLS - Is coming home late after a night out with the guys, smelling of <br />Perfume and beer, lipstick on your collar, slapping your wife on the butt <br />And having the Balls to say: &#039;You&#039;re next, Chubby.&#039; <br />&nbsp;<br />I hope this clears up any confusion on the definitions. <br /><br />&nbsp;Medically speaking there is no difference. Both result in sudden death.<br /><br /><hr /><br />They were together in the House. <br /><br />Just the two of them. <br /><br />It was a cold, dark, stormy night. <br /><br />The storm had come quickly and each time the thunder boomed he watched her jump.<br /><br />She looked across the room and admired his strong appearance . . . and wished that he would take her in his arms, comfort her and protect her from the storm. <br /><br />Suddenly, with a pop, the power went out. <br /><br />She screamed. He raced to the sofa where she was cowering. <br /><br />He didn&#039;t hesitate to pull her into his arms. <br /><br />He knew this was a forbidden union and expected her to pull back. <br /><br />He was surprised when she didn&#039;t resist but instead clung to him. <br /><br />The storm raged on.<br /><br />They knew it was wrong.<br /><br />Their families would never understand. <br /><br />So consumed were they in their FEAR that they heard no opening of doors. <br /><br />Just the faint click of a camera . . .<br /><br />(http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3305/4589117323_20954ee992_o.jpg)<br /><br />

				WHAT NOT TO NAME YOUR DOG <br /><br />Everybody who has a dog calls him Rover or Boy. I called mine SEX. Now, Sex has been very embarrassing to me. When I went to the City Hall to renew his dog license, I told the clerk I wanted a license for Sex. He said, &quot;I&#039;d like to have one too!&quot; Then I said, &quot;But this is a dog.&quot; He said he didn&#039;t care what she looked like. Then I said, &quot;You don&#039;t understand, I&#039;ve had sex since I was 9 years old.&quot; <br /><br />He said I must have been quite a kid. When I got married and went on my honeymoon, I took Sex with me. I told the motel clerk that I wanted a room for my wife and me and a special room for Sex. He said that every room in the place was for sex. I said, &quot;You don&#039;t understand. Sex keeps me awake at night.&quot; The clerk said, &quot;Me too.&quot; <br /><br />One day I entered Sex in a contest, but before competition began, the dog ran away. Another contestant asked why I was just standing there looking around. I told him I planned to have Sex in the contest. He told me I should have sold my own tickets. &quot;But you don&#039;t understand&quot; I said. &quot;I had hoped to have Sex on TV.&quot; He called me a show off. <br /><br />When my wife and I separated we went to court to fight for the custody of the dog. I said, &quot;Your Honor, I had Sex before I was married.&quot; The judge said, &quot;Me too.&quot; Last night Sex ran off again. I spent hours looking around town for him. A cop came over and asked, &quot;What are you doing in this alley at 2 o&#039;clock in the morning?&quot; I said, &quot;Looking for Sex.&quot; MY CASE COMES UP FRIDAY.<br /><br />

I saw one I really liked.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MAN: &quot;How much?&quot; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WOMAN: &quot;$90,000&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MAN: &quot;OK, but for that price I want it with all the options.&quot; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WOMAN: &quot;Great! Oh, and one more thing, the house I wanted last year is back on the market.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They&#039;re asking $980,000&quot; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MAN: &quot;Well, then go ahead and give them an offer of $900,000.&nbsp;They will probably take it. If not, <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; we can go the extra 80 thousand if it&#039;s really a pretty good deal.&quot; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WOMAN: &quot;OK. I&#039;ll see you later!&nbsp; I love you so much!&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MAN: &quot;Bye!&nbsp; I love you, too.&quot; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><div align="center"><em>The man hangs up.&nbsp;The other men in the locker room are staring at him in&nbsp;astonishment, mouth agape.</em></div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He turns and asks: &quot;Anyone know who this phone belongs to?&quot;

				An old man was walking in the forest when he heard, by his feet, a very weak voice. <br /><br />He bent down to look and saw that the voice came from a little frog:&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&quot;I&#039;m a beautiful, erotic and sensual princess, skilled in all the carnal pleasures of love.&nbsp; An evil queen, envious of my charms, turned me into a frog, but if you kiss me I will once again be a fair maiden, and I will provide you with all the joys and delights of my voluptuous temperament and my ardent lust.&quot;<br /><br />The old man picked up the little frog and put her into his pocket. <br /><br />Bewildered, the frog looked out and asked:<br /><br />&quot;What, you&#039;re not going to kiss me?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Nope,&quot; replied the old man. &quot;At my age it&#039;s more fun to have a talking frog than a sex maniac.&quot;<br />

				A guy decides that maybe he&#039;d like to have a pet and goes to a pet shop.<br /><br />After looking around he spots a parrot sitting on a little perch; it doesn&#039;t have any feet or legs. The guy says out loud, &quot;Geez, I wonder what happened to this parrot?&quot; <br /><br />&quot;I was born this way,&quot; says the parrot. &quot;I&#039;m a defective parrot.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Ha, ha,&quot; the guy laughs. &quot;It sounded like this parrot actually understood what I said and answered me.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;I understand every word,&quot; says the parrot. &quot;I am a highly intelligent and thoroughly educated bird.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Yeah?&quot; the guy asks. &quot;Then answer this: how do you hang onto your perch without any feet?&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Well,&quot; the parrot says, &quot;this is a little embarrassing, but since you asked, I will tell you. I wrap my little parrot penis around this wooden bar, kind of like a little hook. You can&#039;t see it because of my feathers.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Wow,&quot; says the guy, &quot;you really can understand and answer; can&#039;t you?&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Of course. I speak both Spanish and English. I can converse with reasonable competence on almost any subject: politics, religion, sports, physics, philosophy. And I am especially good at ornithology. You should buy me; I am a great companion.&quot; <br /><br />The guy looks at the $200.00 price tag. He says. &quot;I can&#039;t afford that.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Pssst,&quot; the parrot hisses, motioning the guy over with one wing. &quot;Nobody wants me because I don&#039;t have any feet. You can get me for $20.00; just make an offer.&quot; <br /><br />The guy offers twenty dollars and walks out with the parrot. Weeks go by and the parrot is sensational. He&#039;s funny; he&#039;s interesting; he&#039;s a great pal, he understands everything, sympathizes, and gives good advice. The guy is delighted.<br /><br />One day the guy comes home from work and the parrot says, &quot;Pssst,&quot; and motions him over with one wing. The guy goes up close to the cage. &quot;I don&#039;t know if I should tell you this or not,&quot; says the parrot, &quot;but it&#039;s about your lover and the mailman.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;What?&quot; asks the guy. <br /><br />&quot;Well,&quot; the parrot says, &quot;when the mailman came to the door today, your lover greeted him in a pair of briefs that showed everything and kissed him on the mouth.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;What happened then?&quot; asks the guy.<br /><br />&quot;Then the mailman came into the house and put his hand on your lovers crotch and began petting him all over,&quot; reports the parrot.<br /><br />&quot;My God!&quot; the guy says. &quot;Then what?&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Then he pulled down the briefs, got down on his knees and began to lick him, starting with his chest, slowly going down and down.&quot; The parrot pauses for a long time... <br /><br />&quot;What happened? What happened?&quot; says the frantic guy. <br /><br />&quot;That&#039;s what pisses me off. I don&#039;t know.&quot; said the parrot. &quot;I got a hard-on, and fell off my freaking perch.&quot;<br /><br />

				A Christmas Story<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When four of Santa&#039;s elves got sick, the trainee elves<br />did not produce toys as fast as the regular ones, and<br />Santa began to feel the Pre-Christmas pressure.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then Mrs. Claus told Santa her Mother was coming to visit, which<br />stressed Santa even more.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When he went to harness the reindeer, he found that three of<br />them were about to give birth and two others had jumped the<br />fence and were out, Heaven knows where.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then when he began to load the sleigh, one of the floorboards<br />cracked, the toy bag fell to the ground and all the toys were<br />scattered.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Frustrated, Santa went in the house for a cup of apple cider and a<br />shot of rum. When he went to the cupboard, he discovered the elves<br />had drunk all the cider and hidden the liquor.. In his<br />frustration, he accidentally dropped the cider jug, and it broke<br />into hundreds of little glass pieces all over the kitchen floor.<br />He went to get the broom and found the mice had eaten all the<br />straw off the end of the broom.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Just then the doorbell rang, and an irritated Santa marched to the<br />door, yanked it open, and there stood a little angel with a great<br />big Christmas tree.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The angel said very cheerfully, &#039;Merry Christmas, Santa. Isn&#039;t<br />this a lovely day? I have a beautiful tree for you. Where would<br />you like me to stick it?&#039;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And so began the tradition of the little angel on top of the<br />Christmas tree.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not a lot of people know this. <br />&nbsp;<br />

				Walmart announced that, sometime in 2011, it will begin offering customers a new discount item ----Walmart&#039;s own brand of wine. <br /><br />The world&#039;s largest retail chain is teaming up with Ernest &amp; Julio Gallo Winery of California to produce the spirits at an affordable price, in the $2 - $5 range.<br /><br />Wine connoisseurs may not be inclined to put a bottle of Walmart brand into their shopping carts, but &quot;there is a market forinexpensive wine,&quot; said Kathy Micken, professor of marketing at the University of Arkansas .<br /><br />&quot;But the right name is important.&quot;<br /><br />Customer surveys were conducted to determine the most attractive name for the Walmart wine brand.<br /><br />The top surveyed names in order of popularity were: <br /><br />10. Chateau Traileur Parc<br />9. White Trashfindel<br />8. Big Red Gulp<br />7. World Championship Riesling<br />6. NASCARbernet<br />5. Chef Boyardeaux<br />4. Peanut Noir<br />3. I Can&#039;t Believe it&#039;s not Vinegar<br />2. Grape Expectations<br />1. Nasti Spumante<br /><br />The beauty of Walmart wine is that it can be served with either white meat (Possum) or red meat (Squirrel).<br /><br />P.S. Don&#039;t bother writing back that this is a hoax. I know possum is not a white meat.<br />
