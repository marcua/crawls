				So, I love Project Runway and I recently found a blog that does <em>really</em> funny recaps of past episodes.&nbsp; I just thought you should know.&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />http://fourfour.typepad.com/fourfour/projrun/index.html

				Thanks for the link! I love this show too. I hate Jeffrey and am rooting for Michael.<br /><br />One of my favorite recap blogs is Project Rungay (http://projectrungay.blogspot.com/). These guys are hilarious.

				Or:&nbsp; Big Brother season finale on Tuesday!&nbsp; Anybody?&nbsp; <br /><br />(Yeah okay, so anybody who&#39;s still watching is probably dreading seeing the finale at this point.&nbsp; Whatever.) :roll:<br /><br />I watch so much TV lately that turning it into a social activity would probably be better for my social life.&nbsp; I already have a Lost social night booked up, but anybody else hooked on Prison Break, or Grey&#39;s Anatomy, or Veronica Mars?&nbsp; (I know, I know, not reality.)<br /><br />I&#39;m afraid of getting hooked on any new shows at this point - as it is, I&#39;ve got to get a DVR soon if I&#39;m going to keep up this year.&nbsp; Darn these TV writers and their writing of good shows lately!

				so what do people think about the final outcome of project runway? I was really rooting for Uli but it doesn&#39;t surprise me that Jeffrey won. some of michael&#39;s pieces were just way off I though and same with Laura. She&#39;ll do well as an evening wear dress maker, she could definitely start her own dress shop no problem. Michael I think just need to continue refining who he his and the clothes he makes...

				I didn&#39;t care for Jeffrey, but he grew on me, and I think his style is really interesting.&nbsp; The last four challenges his outfits were really impressive.&nbsp; I still can&#39;t deal with the neck tattoo, but they humanized him with the first part of the finale episode, meeting his wife and child.&nbsp; I really liked the other three, though I&#39;d been hoping Kayne would make the final three.&nbsp; Laura and Uli did really interesting collections, though nothing that jumped out as much as Jeffrey&#39;s main piece.

				Great show last night.<br />Jeff deserved it and has the best prospects for a full on business from this.&nbsp; He really gave it his all. A real jerk at times and needs to watch his mouth as an adult and business person.<br /><br />Uli rocked and winning or not will probably open up an upscale Miami shop for resort clothes and rich girls outfits.&nbsp; She had the sexiest clothes and models.&nbsp; They all looked sort of naked even though dressed. Great combination.<br /><br />Im glad Laura didnt win.&nbsp; And her stuff was teriffic.&nbsp; She will always have a following here in NYC and make lots of money from it. <br /><br />Michael, showed how young and ho&#39; happy he is with that collection.&nbsp; Looked like a line of clothes for hip hop ho&#39; babies.&nbsp; He will be huge someday soon though.&nbsp; Great talent.<br /><br />Anyone see Top chef afterwards?&nbsp; Looks like a good new season.&nbsp; The new host rocks over the last one who knew nothing of food and chefs.&nbsp; MMM...
