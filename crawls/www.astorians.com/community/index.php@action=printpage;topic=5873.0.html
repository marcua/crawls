				So with the crappy weather, I have been grading papers indoors instead of cafes...this has left me in front of the tube, where it seems that a Star Wars marathon is occuring daily, and I have nagging questions. I&#039;ll start with one.<br /><br />How the hell old is Princess Amydalla? I mean, is she ten, fifteen, twenty years older than Anakin? How old do you have to be to be a Queen (Episode 1) and then a senator (episode 2). I can&#039;t figure it out. She meets Anakin when he is about 10? and she is????<br /><br />Any takers?

				I&#039;m gonna guess she was about 34.&nbsp; I think George Lucas was fantasizing about that hot female teacher that slept with her you student, and protrayed that in the movie.

				Great question. I&#039;m a huge Star Wars fan<br /><br />As for your questions: <br /><br />In the first prequel, &quot;The Phantom Menace&#8221;, Padm&#233; Amidala is 14 years old and Queen of the Naboo. In &#8220;Attack of the Clones&#8221;, Padm&#233; is 24 years old and a Senator.&#160; In the third movie &#8220;Revenge of the Sith&#8221;, Padm&#233; is 27 years old. <br />

				Yes, I read most of the books, though that was awhile back. <br />Queen Amidala was born Padm&#233; Naberrie. At around 8 years old Padm&#233; assisted with the Shadda-Bi-Boran exodus.&#160; Shadda-Bi-Boran was a planet whose primary star was due to implode.&#160; Though the planet was evacuated, the species died off as they were unable to adapt anywhere else. At around 9 or 10 years of age Padm&#233;&#160; became an Apprentice Legislature and by 14 years old she was elected Queen of Naboo. <br />

				Yay, a SW geek thread!!!&nbsp; :mrgreen: :-D<br /><br />I alwasy had a problem with her being an elected queen at such a young age. Had she inhereted the throne, OK. But who VOTES for a barely teenager to run a planet??? She must have had 2-3 years at most governing experience. It never made any sense.... :|<br /><br />It would have been better if she was a real monarch and then the planet voted to become a republic or some sort of representative democracy. Then in recognition of her popularity and respect, they elect her to be some sort of Senator emeritus.<br /><br />If it was REALLY up to me, I would have made Anakin older in the first movie anyway. Like 12 or 13 when you really start getting interested in girls, instead of a 2nd grader.

				Well, are we clear on how old anakin was? He definitely wasn&#039;t a second grader, maybe fourth, but still young. I have other un-answered questions as well. <br /><br />Like, in a technologically savvy environment, how is r2d2 in use from episode 1 all the way to episode 6...that must span something like 40-50 years? Didn&#039;t they upgrade and have tech advancements in that time? and junk the old robots. I don&#039;t have the same t.v. I had five years ago and we are no where near as close to building a death star.

It&#039;s not there for everyone. The good guys are the underdogs. No $$ to upgrade their robots. I seem to recall that they spend a lot of time trying to fix their own technology and hunting for parts in junk heaps. The technology exists, sure, and that&#039;s why they armies of exotically designed warrior robots, those giant metallic elephants, the flying scooters, etc. The good guys meet their technological superiority with light sabers, which I think we can assume are not exactly cutting edge technology in that context. <br /><br />I&#039;ve also noticed that the good guys tend to be riding animals a lot, and the bad guys tend to be riding sleek state-of-the-art vehicles. Again, good guys are the underdogs, which is what makes it interesting. If they had all the $$ and technology, it wouldn&#039;t be much of story. <br /><br />Anyway, C3P0 and R2D2 are characters in their own right - it just wouldn&#039;t do to upgrade them out of the story! It suggest loyalty on the part of the good guys that they appreciate them and keep them around instead of trading them in.

				OK. Star Wars geekiness warning...<br /><br />I have an meta idea abouit technology in the Star Wars universe... that the galaxy is actually engaged in a technological <em>retreat</em>, meaning that over time, less and less technology is being used. And eventually will resort to primitivism before it turns and begins advancing again toward what we now understand of technological innovation and application. Like an inverse parabola.<br /><br />Think about it... The whole saga takes place in the past. &quot;A long time ago&quot; blah blah... And as someone said above, we&#039;re constantly reminded that the central conflict is humanity vs. technology. Or rather de-humanizing technology, which seems to be inevitable no matter how good the intentions. Men become anonymous clones to combat drone robots. Warriors are literally fused with machinery to make them more powerful.<br /><br />I was playing one of my SW video games (I warned you, this is SW geekiness here&nbsp; :mrgreen: ) which take place several thousand years before the films. And I&#039;m noticing that there&#039;s the same, if not better technology to be used: weapons, armor, ships, droids, and so on. And the archetypes in the game (Sith lords, Jedi, others) seemed way more powerful than what we know of them through the films.<br /><br />Seemed kinda odd to me that over <em>thousands</em> of years so little would change. Then I thought, what if it&#039;s some sort of technology entropy?<br /><br />Central to the game is a once-super advanced race that held immense power through some form of &#039;alien technology&#039;. Something like 15,000 years before the timeframe of the films. But their race eventually failed and their technology mostly lost. So you see, the galaxy starts off at a technological high point, and then it&#039;s all downhill from there...<br /><br />And yes, I gave it way too much thought perhaps, but such is the manner in which this brain works.<br /><br />

				I don&#039;t think you way off base with that.&nbsp; Reminds me of Asimov&#039;s Foundation series (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Foundation_Series) In Foundation there the central government that just collapsed and the farther you were from the center of the empire the faster you lost your tech.&nbsp; Which was basically the theme of the books.

Glad to see I&#039;m not the only SW geek in Astoria. When I was 11 I saw the original SW, now known as episode IV: A New Hope, in the theater with my little brother and my best friend. It was the intermediary days of Passover, known as Chol Ha&#039;Moed. Back then the ushers didn&#039;t kick everyone out after a movie, so we saw it 16 times in 2 days. We repeated that every year until we were 16, with every SW movie that came out. In all I have seen SW:Episodes- IV, V &amp; VI over 500 times, each. I also used to have an original Star Wars poster with Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford And Carrie Fisher on my bedroom door. My mother took it down when I was 13 because she said it wasn&#039;t appropriate. I recently found out that one of those original posters, in good condition, is worth over $800! I never forgave my mother.

				I was thinking my apt, with the 32&quot; HD LCD and the A/C if necessary.&nbsp; &nbsp; But a bar would work too.<br /><br />I KNOW Lavelle&#039;s would be empty and they&#039;d have room, but they have no food and the beer selection isn&#039;t that great.<br /><br />It&#039;s three days away, so we have time.

				I remember&nbsp; going to see the first, now epsiode&nbsp; IV, Star&nbsp; Wars&nbsp; in &#039;77, and being more&nbsp; impressed&nbsp; with Close&nbsp; Encounters and seeing Led Zeppelin that summer.&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; Still, over the years&nbsp; become more of&nbsp; fan, and changed&nbsp; my mind&nbsp; as to who were&nbsp; the villains, by&nbsp; the last one, Revenge&nbsp; of&nbsp; The Sith. &#039;Anakin/Darth&#039; was left to fry&nbsp; by Obi-wan, some friend. Darth Vader was&nbsp; misunderstood and sacrificed&nbsp; himself&nbsp; to save&nbsp; his son, and the universe, at the end. Darth Vader&nbsp; was&nbsp; the &#039;hero&#039;, and he had a damn cool costume to boot, compared&nbsp; to those&nbsp; Jedi &#039;wusses.&#039;&nbsp; :lol:

				I was going to start a new topic but I found this thread and it seemed appropriate.<br /><br />I came across these Episode 1 and 2 reviews and found them hysterical as well as right on the money and decided to share...<br /><br />Episode 1:&nbsp; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxKtZmQgxrI&nbsp; (seven parts)<br />Episode 2:&nbsp; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfBhi6qqFLA&amp;feature=related&nbsp; &nbsp;(nine parts)<br /><br /><br />After watching these, I can&#039;t wait until I have time to watch the movies again to see if my enjoyment level is raised or lowered.<br /><br />
