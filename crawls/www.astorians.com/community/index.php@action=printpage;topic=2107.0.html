				Hey. Yeah, I heard mention of this book on NPR this morning, as part of their fundraising shpiel.<br /><br />I would definitely not recommend it. It was a book for housewives in 1927 France, and thus has no modern conveniences, and it also probably assumes you&#39;ve been cooking at your mother&#39;s knee. Also, meats are decidedly different now than they were then (especially pork), and we have a vastly larger array of vegetables available.<br /><br />If you&#39;re looking for a general-purpose cookbook, here are three recommendations...<br /><br />The New Joy of Cooking (http://www.ecookbooks.com/products.html?ref=286386562&amp;sid=95403720060512100756&amp;action=det_23434)<br />Mark Bittman Cooks Everything (http://www.ecookbooks.com/products.html?ref=286386562&amp;sid=95403720060512100756&amp;action=det_23494)<br />Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone, Deborah Madison (http://www.ecookbooks.com/products.html?ref=286386562&amp;sid=95403720060512100756&amp;action=det_26940)<br /><br />The last one is obviously meat-free... I don&#39;t own the middle one, but lots of people have praised it.<br />

Hm. I actually have to recommend Joy again as a starting place, since she has a fairly comprehensive basic coverage of the French sauces and versions of most of the canonical French dishes (coq au vin, steak au poivre, etc.). Also, I&#39;ve got this book: Bistro: French Country Recipes for Home Cooks (http://www.ecookbooks.com/products.html?ref=286386562&amp;sid=20613820060512112117&amp;action=det_31953), which is pretty good. I find it quite strange that rabbit is considered poultry to the French, but anyway. And I have Wolfgang Puck&#39;s book (http://www.ecookbooks.com/products.html?ref=286386562&amp;sid=20613820060512112117&amp;action=det_22495), which is also pretty good, fancier fare than the bistro cookbook, but I&#39;ve only used it a couple of times. Either of those I&#39;d recommend. I haven&#39;t seen the Balthazar cookbook (http://www.ecookbooks.com/products.html?ref=286386562&amp;sid=20613820060512112117&amp;action=det_30489), but it looks interesting, and it&#39;s won several awards! Let me know if you pick it up...!<br />

				DUDE, you missed the 2 for 1 match yesterday morning! THAT&#39;s when you should have pledged. This morning they were asking for pedges and there was no match, no computer drawing to enter into, and I&#39;m sitting there thinking, <em>you guys got nothing</em>!&nbsp; :-D<br /><br />And second to Morning Edition, the only other thing I ever even try to catch is Car Talk.

				I listen to a lot of public radio, and have taken to listening to the podcasts of Soundcheck, Studio 360, and (sometimes) the Leonard Lopaid show on my fauxPod on the train... Soundcheck is a particularly good show, I think.<br /><br />The last two times I tried to donate money to WNYC, though, I completely filled out the web form, checked all the boxes, submitted the form, it said everything was fine and.... nothing. No money deducted from my credit card, and no thank-you gift in the mail... Weird. Well, my karma is aided by my trying to donate, right?<br />

				I called my pledge in today.&nbsp; I was hoping to get a 2 for one today, but alas, it was not to be.&nbsp; So I got the next best thing in the matching donation.<br /><br />But I listen to WNYC all day.&nbsp; Brian Lehrer, Leonard Lopate, Soundcheck, Fresh Air, and of course, All Things Considered.&nbsp; It&#39;s what gets me through the day.&nbsp; But Radiolab is really fascinating.&nbsp; The topics are always really wild, and the production is magnificent.&nbsp; They only produce maybe 5 or 6 episodes every 6 months, around pledge time.

				Did you listen to radio lab today?&nbsp; All about the universe, carl sagan, the team he headed producing the record sent into space.&nbsp; A terrific segment.<br /><br />Josh,&nbsp; here are some good cook book basics:<br />Mark Bitmans: how to cook everything.&nbsp; covers a lot and is very well written.<br /><br />Tom Colicchio: think like a chef. The focus is on some important techniques and shows you some recipes around them.&nbsp; His idea is that learn the techniques and you dont need recipes, just ideas.<br /><br />Molly Oneill: new york cookbook: a collection of recipes from famous restaurant owners, famous ethnic food places, firemen, pasta shop owners, etc...&nbsp; A wonderful variety of very solid and delicious recipes from the multicultural world that is NYC.&nbsp; It was my first cookbook as an adult.<br /><br />Lidia Bastianich:&nbsp; Lidia&#39;s Italian American kitchen: Simply because she is the Italian grandmother chef you always wanted that can talk to you in english. Solid good home cooked food.<br /><br />Any cook book by james Peterson for more serious cooking:&nbsp; &quot;Sauces&quot; is everything you want to know from mother sauces to every single derivitive from them.&nbsp; well written and a resource to have.&nbsp; His vegetables cook book is a must as well. It even has a veg seasons chart.<br /><br />For very serious learning pick up the &quot;professional chef series number 6&quot; from CIA.&nbsp; its the sourse book for their cooking school.&nbsp; very very good resource.<br /><br />Nigella Lawson of lovely bubbly british fame produces well written and delicious cook books.<br /><br />Please do not buy the balthazar or les halle cook books, good looking but not the easiest to read, prepare or shop for.&nbsp; its a good coffee table book at best. No offense to their great restaurants.&nbsp; Also do not buy any Bobby Flay books for same reasons.<br /><br />

				Yeah, some people think he&#39;s irritating, but I love him. Anyone who <strong>doesn&#39;t</strong> assume that I know certain very basic things about cooking is the perfect guy to teach me how to cook. A lot of people (like myself) don&#39;t really feel comfortable with the basics but are too embarassed to ask, and the pros can always benefit from going back over that stuff. Hence the beauty of Alton (and of Good Eats)!

				Oh, yes, I&#39;d definitely recommend I&#39;m Just Here For The Food.&nbsp; I don&#39;t always agree with Alton (to wit:&nbsp; stuffing belongs <em>in</em> the bird, not beside it - that&#39;s why it&#39;s called <em>stuffing</em> - and besides, it just isn&#39;t the same without the hours of savoury melting fat and meat drippings soaking into it -- but even he finally came around to that), but even though I consider myself to be a fairly competent cook, I have certainly learned from him.&nbsp; I love learning about the science behind what&#39;s really going on.*&nbsp; Not only that - I have his salt cellar and his beaker-measuring cup.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-D<br /><br />Jim and I went to brunch at a friend&#39;s house.&nbsp; We started talking about the food network.&nbsp; Ah, Alton Brown!&nbsp; And Iron Chef!&nbsp; Jim and I got the starry-eyed look (well, perhaps not quite ;)).&nbsp; His wife exclaimed, &quot;Oh, no!&nbsp; Alton Brown does all that weird stuff.&nbsp; I love Unwrapped!&quot;&nbsp; It was all I could do to keep from simultaneously shuddering and cracking up.&nbsp; We are complete opposites with food.<br /><br />*If you like the science stuff, I also recommend What Einstein Told His Cook (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393011836/sr=8-1/qid=1147904191/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-8458789-6177662?%5Fencoding=UTF8).&nbsp; It&#39;s not a cookbook, but it demystifies a lot of what happens in the kitchen, giving you a background to many cooking techniques.&nbsp; That, and the book that is arguably the Mother (pun intended) of them all, Harold McGee&#39;s On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0684800012/ref=pd_sim_b_2/002-8458789-6177662?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;v=glance&amp;n=283155).<br /><br />Incidently, all three authors - Alton Brown, Robert Wolke and Harold McGee - have conducted the Washed Mushroom Test.&nbsp; Washing mushrooms is a perfectly acceptable way to clean them; they don&#39;t soak up enough water to make a difference in cooking, which vindicates my mother, which makes me happy.&nbsp; :-D

I gave that book to my step-mom for Christmas a couple of years ago (she&#39;s the master chef of the family), and she adored it, though I never got a chance to read it myself. Guess I should borrow it from her! And I&#39;ll be adding Alton&#39;s book to my wish list. I could really stand to READ a cookbook, especially one that covers all those basics. Especially with the veggies starting to pour in come June!<br /><br />And Josh, try again -- with feeling this time! These <em>pretzels</em> are making me <em>thirsty</em>!!
