				Although I&#39;ve really enjoyed posts like &quot;Rotten Eggs&quot;, posters to this forum should really refrain from using it as a Chat Room.&nbsp; <br /><br />ie: Children&#39;s Literature (What children&#39;s book to buy one&#39;s niece)<br />ie: Another reason not to subscribe to AOL<br />ie: Help w/ Tropical Aquarium<br />ie &quot;Great Cat Video&quot;!!!!!?!?!?!?! Common!<br /><br />Perhaps we should have a section of the forum really &quot;General&quot;, random, non-Astoria related posts.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />

				Wow.&nbsp; It&#39;s been this way for quite some time though.&nbsp; Is it really just supposed to be about Astoria?&nbsp; Can&#39;t we be from astoria and still post in an Astorian discussion - one that takes place in Astoria?&nbsp; Or maybe the rules need to be clarified on this?&nbsp; Hmmm...&nbsp; Not a big deal to me though.&nbsp;

				From what I understand, it&#39;s a forum for people who live in/used to live in Astoria, and is not necessarily <em>just about</em> Astoria. So, because there are a lot of Astorians here, anyone can feel free to ask questions about the neighborhood. But the conversation shouldn&#39;t be limited or else the board would go dead.<br /><br />What&#39;s with all these people trying to moderate conversation around here?

				i whole heartedly agree with mr. ferris <br /><br />i HATE it when people post on other topics not about astoria! i am guilty of posting up some things but....<br /><br />there are lots of posts here where it seems as though it&#39;s posted directly at other members. it&#39;s like dude, why dont you just all email eachother, send an evite, whatever. it makes me and i bet others, feel left out when you are getting an event like that together, and say, you know me and blah blah blah were thinking.... or let&#39;s have blah blah blah at my house. just send an email to your friends.<br /><br />i was especially annoyed at the picnicking in roosevelt island... THAT&#39;S NOT EVEN QUEENS!!! <br /><br />i&#39;d like to see this forum stay more on the ASTORIA side of posting especially EVENTS.&nbsp; <br /><br />things like the crime thread, astoria eats&nbsp; (when they actually eat in ASTORIA!!!), and any other events happening in our parks, etc, is great.<br /><br />but i do agree-- this forum would be so much better if it stuck to being about astoria.&nbsp;

				Wow - ferris, out of the four topics you are referring to three are topics I started. So naturally, I have to defend myself.<br /><br />Okay number one - the children&#39;s lit post was posted only AFTER I had already tried to figure out on my own what would be good to buy. I knew that Astorians would be a good place to ask about this because we have several teachers and book lovers that participate on this board. I have gained an amazing amount of advice on this topic and am very grateful. I don&#39;t regret starting that post at all.<br /><br />Number two - AOL. I don&#39;t see how this ISN&#39;T related to Astoria. Many people in Astoria subscribe to AOL or may be considering it, and if you read the thread more closely you will see that people are helping each other out by suggesting ways to unsubscribe. While I did post it originally as an interesting anecdote, it did turn into something beneficial.<br /><br />Number three - Cat videos and links. Yes, this is a complete thread about the love of cats. Amazingly enough (or not amazing at all), many of our Astorians are animal lovers. If you will notice I directed one of my videos at megc and Jayme who happen to both be active Astorians participants and cat lovers. A few other people jumped in and started talking about their cats - who live in Astoria. (Besides, my cat can only meow at this point, unlike some of the cats on the videos I shared who can say &quot;Mama&quot; and &quot;I love you,&quot; so I may have been inadvertantly trying to give him a voice in the Astorians community by posting that thread. :))<br /><br />While I understand that you and others are not entirely enthusiastic about some of the conversations that take place on Astorians, I think that you may want to consider that some Astorians&#39; lives do not revolve exclusively around Astoria. The name of the board is Astorians, thus implying it is a forum for the people who live here - not for Astoria, a place, that happens to have people who live here.<br /><br />I spend an incredible amount of time away from Astoria every day at my job, so to some of you I suppose I owe an apology for some posts that stray into Manhattan or into other parts of the Internet universe. I suppose that some posts that I have started in the Politics section (i.e. Why Did the Chicken Cross the Ocean Twice?, Social Security numbers, etc.) would be considered inappropriate as well because the chicken post is referring to China and Social Security problems originate in Washington DC. I also have to apologize for my promotion of an online survey that had absolutely nothing to do with Astorians, but rather was associated with my occupation.<br /><br />I think, though, that while some posts may seem like they have strayed away from Astoria they really do still have merit here. We&#39;re all Astorians and a lot of us have become friends online, so instead of blasting out an e-mail with a link to cat videos or asking for advice to only a select few about children&#39;s lit, I felt like my Astorians friends could be amused for a few minutes (after all, many have mentioned that they have boring jobs in Manhattan or elsewhere), or could offer me advice that I knew I could trust.<br /><br />Anyway, if you sincerely have a problem with how people post then you should make a request to the admin group for more stringent monitoring of appropriate/inappropriate posts. I have a feeling, though, that they will likely not agree with you as merm has pointed out on multiple occasions that he prefers an online environment that acts as a natural conversation and exchange, and other admin have been guilty of participating in some of these types of so-called inappropriate or non-Astoria threads.

				No need for anyone to defend their posts. Ferris&#39; own post is off topic by his own standards as it doesn&#39;t relate to &quot;Astoria&quot;, but that is OK. Wasabi is right, the point of this category is to be more like a &quot;chat&quot; room where a wide variety of topics of interest to &quot;Astorians&quot; are posted. This doesn&#39;t mean that the admins wouldn&#39;t be willing to consider a change though if enough people don&#39;t like the set up.<br /><br />I don&#39;t currently see any problem with the &quot;General&quot; category, except that I&#39;m mildly tempted to put this particular thread under &quot;Rants&quot;. :)

				I agree with you merm.&nbsp; Just chill out.&nbsp; This board is for Astorians by Astorians.&nbsp; We can all agree to living here AND having interests outside of the neighborhood.&nbsp; Sounds like a good mix to me.<br /><br />As for Astorians having activities outside Astoria, it&#39;s still us so whats the problem?&nbsp; Last I looked there&#39;s a big world out there to explore.

				seeing as how i was one of the quoted annoying threads i would like to say that they way i look at this forum is a way of neighbors reaching out to each other. whether it&#39;s for help, for information, a laugh or a get together. this is a website about a community, astoria, but what makes a community is the residents in it. this board is an off shoot of the community where these so called off topic posts really are on topic as we are getting a better understanding of each other as neighbors in a community. and i would like to know my neighbors. <br />and some of these topics may start out seemingly unrelated as to whether or not the answer lies in astoria, but there&#39;s always a chance it could come full circle. i could have seen a great children&#39;s book at seaburn to recommend to wasabi. or harlan could have known of a fish store in the neighborhood where i could find something i was looking for. that may not have happened but now i know one of my neighbors has a freshwater aquarium and another has a niece. i still find that information valuable and very astoria-centic.<br />a community isn&#39;t about one set of things in particular. a community is the sum of all its parts. and the parts are right here in this board, reaching out to each other making astoria a better place through every rotten egg story, aol mishap, fish inquiry or book quest. <br />

Nobody is out of line by posting any thread that is related to &quot;Astorians&quot; in any way. Even this topic is A-OK even though it&#39;s not &quot;about Astoria&quot;.<br /><br />Can&#39;t we all just get along?

				Dudes. It&#39;s only natural that on a board like this, people are going to form what I like to call little buddy groups, which other people might call the more negatively connoting word &quot;cliques.&quot; I for one am not in a clique here, but it&#39;s easy enough to be able to tell by the subject line (or at the very least the first post) if a thread will interest me or not. If not, no big deal, see what the next one says. If so, yay, I am amused for a couple minutes. I might even post my own thread from time to time, like about how they put a Subway where that other place used to be and how the bread stinks, and about the kinds of bugs I get in my apartment. Both highly on-topic and important threads.

				Personally I like the fact that the topics discussed are both broad and Astoria specific.&nbsp; It helps give you a chance to get to know folks and find people who share ones interests or who have experienced similar situations.&nbsp; I especially liked the music video and movie threads.

				i like learning about my neighbors, including what their interests are beyond Astoria. <br /><br />In every RL community I have belonged to, conversation and interaction was not limited to the single thing that brought us together - college groups, churches, etc. OK, there may have been a couple of groups that stuck to the point, but they were the shortest lived and the least successful. I think it&#39;s natural for an online community, especially one this large and this broad, to mirror that fact of life. <br /><br />People want to know each other and be known by others. <br /><br />I think that&#39;s nice.

				It&#39;s also reasonable for the board to grow and change as it matures and as more people get in the mix.&nbsp; I don&#39;t think things are out of control (OOC).&nbsp; The idea of feeling put off by non-Astoria based topics never occurred to me.&nbsp; But that&#39;s just me.&nbsp; :)
