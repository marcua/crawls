				For those willing to share, I&#039;m curious what others pay for rent in Astoria and what they are getting for it so that I (and any others reading) can get a sense of true market rates.&nbsp; As we all know, what brokers tell us is&nbsp; &#039;the norm&#039; for rents is often inflated, since it&#039;s in their interest to get us to pay higher rents.&nbsp; Higher rents = higher commission). <br /><br />As they say, Knowledge is Power.&nbsp; I&#039;ve listed below what I think are key points to take into account, followed by my own info:<br /><br />+++++++++++++++++++++++++<br /><br />Monthly rent:&nbsp; $1750<br /><br />Type of building (private home owned/managed by an individual person/LL? .....small apt building run by a management company?....city-owned building with a Super who lives on-site?....doorman/luxury apt bldg.?)&nbsp; &nbsp;SMALL APT BLDG WITH 8 UNITS OWNED BY A PRIVATE LL<br /><br />Approx age of building/house?&nbsp; SEEMS TO BE MAYBE 50 YEARS OLD AND WAS GUTTED/REDONE MAYBE 15 YEARS AGO?<br /><br />Approx how old is kitchen/bath?&nbsp; KITCHEN MAYBE 15 YEARS OLD...BATH MAYBE 30 YEARS OLD?<br /><br />How many rooms in the apt? (bedrooms?&nbsp; living area?&nbsp; dining area?&nbsp; bathrooms?)&nbsp; 1 BEDROOM, 1 LIVING AREA, SMALL KITCHEN, 1 BATHROOM<br /><br />Overall condition of apartment/building (old feeling/cracks here and there.....pretty nice....very modern/luxury?)&nbsp; PRETTY NICE<br /><br />Private outdoor space?&nbsp; PRIVATE BALCONY<br /><br />Extra storage space?&nbsp; NO EXTRA STORAGE.&nbsp; ONE CLOSET ONLY, IN THE BEDROOM, BUT IT IS A LARGE WARDROBE LENGTH CLOSET.<br /><br />Dishwasher?&nbsp; &nbsp;Microwave? YES TO BOTH<br /><br />Laundry in apartment?&nbsp; elsewhere in building?&nbsp; No laundry in the building?&nbsp; NO LAUNDRY IN THE BLDG<br /><br />Pets allowed?&nbsp; YES CATS ONLY.<br /><br />Heat included?&nbsp; NOT INCLUDED<br /><br />How long of a walk to nearest subway station?&nbsp; 12 MINUTES WALKING AT FAST PACE<br /><br />How many train stations from your Astoria station to first station in Manh?&nbsp; EIGHT<br /><br />Market rate, rent-stabilized or rent-control? RENT-STABIL.&nbsp; BLDG IS 421a<br /><br />How long have you lived in the apartment?&nbsp; TWO YEARS<br /><br />If you have lived in Astoria less than three years, what is your typical approach for finding an apartment in NYC?&nbsp; ...do you always go straight to a broker?...do you try a do-it-yourself search using word-of-mouth, friends, building Supers, etc?&nbsp; Or is your current apartment your very first rental apartment in NYC? (i.e., how much experience do you have navigating the NYC rental market?)&nbsp; I EMPLOY DO IT-YOURSELF METHOD AND ALSO USE BROKERS, AND START SEARCHING 3 MONTHS IN ADVANCE SO I CAN GET SENSE OF THE MOST CURRENT TYPICAL RENTS, AND WHAT I CAN EXPECT TO FIND....<br /><br />If you have lived in Astoria more than three years, how often does your rent typically increase?&nbsp; With every renewal lease, or only every few years when LL feels the need?&nbsp; Have you noticed any changes/new trends in the rent increase pattern of your building,&nbsp; and as Astoria has become more popular?&nbsp; &nbsp;N/A<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				$1561.76 <br />-Astoria Park<br />-6 unit building, good neighbors<br /><br />-Heat/Water Incl.<br />-2 Bedroom arranged as 1 bedroom (master turned into living room, living room turned into dining room - better flow and&nbsp; use of space for one person)<br />-Parquet Floors in all rooms (except Kitchen &amp; bath - see below)<br />-Original crown molding (except bathroom and kitchen - see below)<br />-French Doors between living room and dining room<br /><br /><br />HOWEVER<br /><br /><br />Bathroom that looks like a set from Breaking Bad (not cute - AT ALL). It could double as a crystal meth den, and I am a neat freak. It has old rusty everything w/ whorehouse lighting and crappy ventilation.<br /><br /><br />My Kitchen that looks like a set from Better Call Saul (mixed cabinets from 1980&#039;s, hideous florescent light, 2001 era appliances, but a gorgeous floor I refinished myself). Its so bad I have no other choice but to go completely kitsch.<br /><br /><br />The landlord obviously will not upgrade my rent stabilized unit, and I refuse to do the bathroom myself. The Kitchen is an ongoing project - halfway there.<br /><br /><br />Basically, my rent is so cheap, I am trapped in New York. I may be the only person I know who would lose money if I left NYC.

				thanks for reply.<br /><br />i agree with you 100% that based on how you describe your kitchen, &#039;kitschy&#039; is the way to go.&nbsp; You know...sorta the &#039;when life gives you lemons..&#039; thing.<br /><br />That said, I don&#039;t know that your rent is &#039;so cheap&#039;.&nbsp; Maybe for the size, and for Astoria, but not for NYC as a whole.&nbsp; There are many other parts of NYC where you could pay less and get something nicer.&nbsp; But as we all know, there are many factors that can go into the price of rent...the bldg itself, the size of the apt, the block the bldg is on, the age of the K&amp;B, access to a park, private outdoor space, laundry in the bldg or not, how long to subway, how long to midtown, heat and HW included or not, etc

				Its rather impossible to argue against 650 square feet on Astoria Park to yourself at 1561 and chump change :cheesy:&nbsp; I am so ahead in my retirement goal because of this place (I started out at $850, and that was split with a roomate until I was able to take on the full rent, round 1050) and I was able to take on a rental property overseas. No way I could have gotten ahead of the game anyplace else. God bless Astoria!

				<br />Thanks everyone for additional replies.&nbsp; Very helpful for all of us as it puts things in context.&nbsp; Knowledge is power.&nbsp; ;-)<br /><br />Someone had said...&nbsp; &quot;Rent increases used to be negotiable, but there is a veiled &quot;threat&quot; in each notice of increase, saying the area is in high demand and that others will be more than happy to pay.&quot;<br /><br />Yeah...that of course is a common ploy and mindset of many LL&#039;s...they now have $$ signs in their heads as they see more and more young&#039;uns moving in.&nbsp; I guess I&#039;m lucky and &#039;hopeful&#039; on one hand that...because my LL lives with his family in the bldg., that his desire to retain a good tenant like me will trump his desire to try and flip the apartment by giving me a big enough rent increase that I&#039;ll consider leaving, and then he can start all over with a new (higher rate) &#039;vacancy lease&#039; for the next tenant.&nbsp; At some point, if the rent just keeps going up, I may consider just being straight with him and saying that I don&#039;t &#039;need&#039; to live in an area that&#039;s &#039;popular&#039;...and that while I know Astoria is becoming that way, it doesn&#039;t matter one way or the other to me...that I like the apt as a whole, and the bldg. as a whole, but that I don&#039;t &#039;need&#039; to be in a hot neighborhood like Astoria.&nbsp; (...which is true...all I need is a few decent amenities...but not necessarily as many as we now find ourselves with here in Astoria...not if it means I&#039;m dishing out more for rent than I care to... ;-)

				While I think it&#039;s a great idea to find out what neighbors are paying so you&#039;re not taken advantage of by the realtors, I do think the landlords are entitled to charge what they think is a fair rent. The property taxes are killers, heating costs an arm and a leg, now landlords have to pay for water whereas years ago it was free, there&#039;s constant upkeep of the house, etc. it&#039;s no wonder rents are going up all over the place.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;d be happy if my landlord lowered my rent in exchange for paying for my own heat, hot water and regular water. I like it cooler so I&#039;d probably end up saving money.<br /><br /><br />
