				When will I learn? The answer to life&#039;s problems aren&#039;t at the bottom of a bottle, they&#039;re on TV! <br /><br /><br />Son, when you participate in sporting events, it&#039;s not whether you win or lose: it&#039;s how drunk you get. <br /><br /><br />I&#039;m going to the back seat of my car, with the woman I love, and I won&#039;t be back for ten minutes! <br /><br /><br />[Meeting Aliens] Please don&#039;t eat me!

The lesson is, never try. <br /><br /><br />The only monster here is the gambling monster that has enslaved your mother! I call him Gamblor, and it&#039;s time to snatch your mother from his neon claws! <br /><br /><br />When I look at the smiles on all the children&#039;s faces, I just know they&#039;re about to jab me with something. <br /><br /><br />I&#039;m having the best day of my life, and I owe it all to not going to Church! <br /><br />&nbsp;<br />Lisa, if the Bible has taught us nothing else, and it hasn&#039;t, it&#039;s that girls should stick to girls sports, such as hot oil wrestling and foxy boxing and such and such. <br /><br /><br />I&#039;m not a bad guy!

				Lisa, Vampires are make-believe, like elves, gremlins, and eskimos. <br /><br /><br />I want to share something with you: The three little sentences that will get you through life. Number 1: Cover for me. Number 2: Oh, good idea, Boss! Number 3: It was like that when I got here. <br /><br /><br />Oh, people can come up with statistics to prove anything, Kent. 14% of people know that. <br /><br /><br />Remember that postcard Grandpa sent us from Florida of that Alligator biting that woman&#039;s bottom? That&#039;s right, we all thought it was hilarious. But, it turns out we were wrong. That alligator was sexually harrassing that woman. <br /><br /><br />Old people don&#039;t need companionship. They need to be isolated and studied so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal use. <br /><br /><br />How is education supposed to make me feel smarter? Besides, every time I learn something new, it pushes some old stuff out of my brain. Remember when I took that home winemaking course, and I forgot how to drive? <br /><br />&nbsp;<br />Television! Teacher, mother, secret lover. <br /><br /><br />Homer no function beer well without. <br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve always wondered if there was a god. And now I know there is -- and it&#039;s me. <br /><br /><br />Kill my boss? Do I dare live out the American dream? <br /><br /><br />If something goes wrong at the plant, blame the guy who can&#039;t speak English. <br /><br /><br />I&#039;m never going to be disabled. I&#039;m sick of being so healthy. <br /><br /><br />I like my beer cold, my TV loud and my homosexuals flaming. <br /><br /><br />[Looking at a globe map...country being Uruguay]<br />Hee hee! Look at this country! &#039;You-are-gay.&#039; <br /><br /><br />All my life I&#039;ve had one dream, to achieve my many goals. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br />Dad, you&#039;ve done a lot of great things, but you&#039;re a very old man, and old people are useless. <br /><br /><br />But Marge, what if we chose the wrong religion? Each week we just make God madder and madder. <br /><br /><br />I think Smithers picked me because of my motivational skills. Everyone says they have to work a lot harder when I’m around. <br /><br /><br />Dear Lord.. The gods have been good to me. For the first time in my life, everything is absolutely perfect just the way it is. So here&#039;s the deal: You freeze everything the way it is, and I won&#039;t ask for anything more. If that is OK, please give me absolutely no sign. OK, deal. <br /><br /><br />That&#039;s it! You people have stood in my way long enough. I&#039;m going to clown college! <br /><br /><br />Beer: The cause of, and solution to, all of life&#039;s problems. <br /><br /><br />If something&#039;s hard to do, then it&#039;s not worth doing <br /><br /><br />I&#039;m in no condition to drive...wait! I shouldn&#039;t listen to myself, I&#039;m drunk! <br /><br /><br />&#039;To Start Press Any Key&#039;. Where&#039;s the ANY key? <br />

				<strong>Homer</strong>: How could you?! Haven’t you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain Whatshisname? We live in a society of laws! Why do you think I took you to all those Police Academy movies? For fun? Well, I didn’t hear anybody laughing, did you? Except at that guy who made sound effects. Makes sound effects and laughs. Where was I? Oh yeah! Stay out of my booze<br /><br /><strong>Homer</strong>: Marge, you being a cop makes you the man! Which makes me the woman — and I have no interest in that, besides occasionally wearing the underwear, which as we discussed, is strictly a comfort thing.<br /><br /><strong>Comic Book Guy</strong>: Stan Lee never left. I’m afraid his mind is no longer in mint condition.<br /><br /><strong>Krusty the Clown</strong>: And now, in the spirit of the season: start shopping. And for every dollar of Krusty merchandise you buy, I will be nice to a sick kid. For legal purposes, sick kids may include hookers with a cold.<br /><br /><strong>Sideshow Bob</strong>: Your guilty consciences may make you vote Democratic, but secretly you all yearn for a Republican president to lower taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king!<br /><strong><br />&nbsp;Superintendent Chalmers</strong>: I’ve had it with this school, Skinner. Low test scores, class after class of ugly, ugly children…<br /><br />&nbsp;<strong>Mr. Burns</strong>: What good is money if it can’t inspire terror in your fellow man?<br /><strong><br />&nbsp;Homer</strong>: Oh, everything looks bad if you remember it.<br /><br />&nbsp;<strong>Ralph</strong>: Slow down, Bart! My legs don’t know how to be as long as yours.<br /><br /><strong> Homer</strong>: Donuts. Is there anything they can’t do?<br /><br /><br />
