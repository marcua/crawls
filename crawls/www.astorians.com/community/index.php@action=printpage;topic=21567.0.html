				So... I&#039;m a little suspicious of the new &quot;body work&quot; place that opened on 24th ave. The windows are all blacked out and I saw a pair of stiletto shoes under the opening in the door the other day. I googled the name and apparently it&#039;s listed under a few erotic massage websites so I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;s a prostitution front. This isn&#039;t really the neighborhood for it and I&#039;m a little annoyed that they&#039;re operating so blatantly in a family neighborhood.

				They&#039;re operating in a storefront a few blocks from the 114, 3 blocks from a school, and 2 blocks from a playground in a mostly residential neighborhood. It&#039;s not great for the neighborhood to have a place where you can get a sad handjob from someone who has no other options in life operating out of a storefront. They&#039;re listed online on several registries for erotic massage and nowhere else. So you all are ok with young asian women giving handjobs for money out of a storefront here? There&#039;s a lot of stores for rent on that block and they&#039;re not going to be able to rent them to quality businesses if this is next door. That leads to neighborhood decline. It&#039;s blatent in that it looks like the type of place that it is. The windows are blacked out and there&#039;s neon signs, doesn&#039;t take a lot to figure out what&#039;s up. I would guess not many women would feel comfortable walking in there because of the suspicion that it was a happy ending kind of place.<br /><br /><br />And to those who would like to visit, wouldn&#039;t it just be better to jerk yourself off? I mean, who wants a sad handjob from someone who is being paid to touch you and is most likely disgusted by you? Is the shame post-prostitute really worth it?

				A protest march and public shaming?? There&#039;s nothing more productive you can do with your time?<br />Go to the precinct and tell them to investigate if it bothers you so much, but it sounds like you know a lot about these types of places.

				I knew what this place was as soon as I saw it.&nbsp; As doglover has said, the window are all blacked out.&nbsp; And the neon sign in the window reads &quot;Foot and Backrub&quot;.&nbsp; Note that they do not say &quot;massage&quot;.&nbsp; That&#039;s because you need a license to give massages.&nbsp; I live directly around the corner from this place and I&#039;m not very happy about it, but can I call Valone&#039;s office and complain without any actual proof?&nbsp; Just my &quot;suspicions&quot;?

				I would not jump to conclusions. Neighborhood is 27th street, according to link. Very residential area, some stores near it on 24th.&nbsp; &nbsp;People there won&#039;t go for it if it is&nbsp; illegal massage&nbsp; parlor.&nbsp; Why the&nbsp; hysterics though?&nbsp; <br />&quot;It&#039;s so many blocks from school, it close to police station....&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yeah, and it&#039;s a few blocks from the Beer Garden too.&nbsp; &nbsp;Might ruin people&#039;s drinking.

				It&#039;s at the intersection of 27th st. and 24th Ave and it has the exact same name as the place on 24th Ave. If you&#039;d like to get a sad handjob from someone who is likely disgusted by you and may or may not have been sold into sexual slavery by way of payment for illegal immigration go ahead. <br /><br /><br />There&#039;s hardly any hysterics. Just the notion that maybe prostitution (which is illegal) shouldn&#039;t be going on in a storefront in a residential area. There are two other storefronts for rent on that block. What kind of businesses do you think will be ok locating right next door to a whorehouse? Probably not&nbsp; the kind we would like in our neighborhood. I moved here from a lot of crappy neighborhoods to live somewhere nice. So I guess you&#039;d be ok with a venue for prostitution opening up around the corner from your house which you paid a lot of money for and bringing down your property values, that&#039;s cool, I&#039;m not. If it were legal it would be zoned so that they wouldn&#039;t be able to open in this kind of neighborhood.

				Another problem with these types of establishments is the danger in which they place legitimate, licensed massage therapists.&nbsp; When &quot;massage&quot; is used as a front for prostitution, a startling number of idiots can&#039;t seem to differentiate between sensual touch and therapeutic touch.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m a licensed massage therapist myself, and while we all screen new patients very carefully, you never know when a creeper is going to slip through the cracks.<br /><br />I personally will be taking steps to see that this establishment is closed down.<br />

				Yes, prostitution should be legal. The fact that it&#039;s not means that criminals run prostitution. Drugs should be legal too but because they&#039;re not, drug dealers tend to be an unsavory element. If you believe the fantasy that the hookers are just trying to get by and doing it for themselves you&#039;re naive at best. Pimps run prostitution establishments and pimps tend to not be the best element. And who do you think is going to rent the other two empty storefronts right next to this place? What kind of businesses are going to open up next to this place? It&#039;s going to make them harder to rent, drive down rent prices for the storefronts, and ensure that the type of place that opens there isn&#039;t going to be great for the neighborhood. It&#039;s simplistic and naive to say that this poses no problems to the neighborhood. Also, if it were legal, there would be zoning laws applied to them and they wouldn&#039;t be able to open up in a residential neighborhood like this. If you think it&#039;s a waste of police resources for our vice department (who deals with prostitution specifically) to shut this down that&#039;s just silly. If you think that prostitution is all ladies happily and of their own will and keeping the money they make, you&#039;re not living in reality. There&#039;s rampant sex slavery and human trafficking that goes on in this city to boot. I have no problem with the idea of prostitution, I have a problem with the issues that the nature of it being illegal brings about.

				Well I feel better knowing how many of you advocate for the proliferation of sexual slavery.&nbsp; Do you actually believe girls who work in such places aren&#039;t &quot;procured?&quot;&nbsp; As for the legalization of prostitution, that is the only sensible thing I have seen posted in this thread.&nbsp; Having such a business in the area doesn&#039;t bode well for young girls we are trying to protect from harm: the two 10-year-olds recently sexually groped by a pervert in their elevator in a building near 30th Av, or the eight-year-old who was groped in the library on 31st St. Attracting more sexual trade to the neighborhood isn&#039;t the answer.&nbsp; Next time you want to revel in the delights of receiving &quot;sad handjobs,&quot; think of the innocent kids that have to navigate the same streets, Foxy, Plank, Oliver, Odenthal, rg, and PJ.

				Advocating for the legalization of prostitution, drugs etc does not mean one is an advocate of slavery, gangs and whatever else comes with them. In fact, it&#039;s quite the opposite. Once these industries are regulated, there will be oversight, and a legal avenue to file a complaint, report etc. Once people are legally involved in such businesses gang members and pimps wont have the upper hand nor the incentive to be running these types of trades / establishments.<br /><br />I also don&#039;t think anyone said we should be opening up brothels next to schools and churches ... Everything has it&#039;s proper place.

				There&#039;s a similar rub n tug place on 30th ave, which is in an even more disturbing location (directly across from a church / elementary school, next to Drago Funeral Home).&nbsp; It&#039;s the same kind of set up, blacked out windows, and for a while the lettering on the window said &quot;dong spa&quot; which, which may have been something lost in translation, but whatever, that&#039;s why the place caught my eye. <br />That said, the one thing that irks me about this thread, is the assumption that every &quot;back and foot rub&quot; place in Astoria is going to be a rub and tug place, and that&#039;s not the case. There&#039;s a place further up 30th ave, called Magic Mini Spa, which looks sketchy, but it completely legitimate, as I have personally been there, my brother has been there, and my fiance has been there. Never been offered &quot;extras&quot; or anything. It&#039;s a bare bones operation, for sure, and I&#039;m not sure how they are licensed, but once in a while, I want someone to knead out the knots in my back and shoulders, and I don&#039;t have the money to spend $100 / hour on a licensed massage therapist. The $40 / hour price tag is pretty much my limit, but apparently I&#039;m supposed to feel bad, because my &quot;fast food&quot; massage is competition for legitimate therapists. That&#039;s the unfortunate effect of the free market. If services aren&#039;t offered or are offered at too high a price point, I am free to look elsewhere. <br />I&#039;ve been to a number of the asian back and foot rub places in Astoria, and the first place I mentioned here was the only place where &quot;extras&quot; were ever offered or even considered. I felt sketchy as hell after that offer, so I haven&#039;t been back (I won&#039;t even get into the whole story, which is moderately hilarious, yet skeevy at the same time).&nbsp; That said, I did a quick google search after my experience there, and quickly learned that the rub n tug is not a difficult service to find in Astoria, apparently. <br />That said, if people want to pay for it, why not make it legal, and regulate it, so that there are sanitaion, zoning and employment standards that have to be followed? Logic dictates that it would be safer for everyone involved.

Do I think it&#039;s fair that you, as a licensed massage therapist, has to take continuing education classes? No. Would I vote to overturn that ruling? Absolutely.

I felt sketchy as hell after that offer, so I haven&#039;t been back (I won&#039;t even get into the whole story, which is moderately hilarious, yet skeevy at the same time).&nbsp; That said, I did a quick google search after my experience there, and quickly learned that the rub n tug is not a difficult service to find in Astoria, apparently. <br />That said, if people want to pay for it, why not make it legal, and regulate it, so that there are sanitaion, zoning and employment standards that have to be followed? Logic dictates that it would be safer for everyone involved.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><br /><br />Dong Spa?&nbsp; Gotta love the name.&nbsp;

				I have no idea how to tell a legit place from a non legit place - maybe there are many others in the same boat as me. <br /><br />Perhaps it&#039;s time for another Astorians Outing - a Massage Crawl?&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />

				After I read about this place I was in the area so I decided to check it out myself.&nbsp; It does look kind of suspicious.&nbsp; You have to ring a bell to get in and then a lady comes to the door.&nbsp; I asked her how much it cost and I think she said $50 an hour.&nbsp; Then I asked if she had a pricelist and she said no.&nbsp; The place was kind of dark.&nbsp; I think there was a certificate for a massage therapist hanging on the wall, but I can&#039;t be positive about that.&nbsp; I wouldnt go here for a back or foot rub, but I just wanted to see it with my own eyes after reading these posts. :rolleyes:

				No I wouldn&#039;t go there.&nbsp; I have been going for the past 2 or 3 years to a great acupuncturist on 34th St. in the city for what started out as a back and hip problem.&nbsp; He recommended that I also get acupressure massage there.&nbsp; I don&#039;t get the acuipuncture there anymore, but I still go there once a week for the acupressure massage which is done by a professional and it&#039;s great.&nbsp; It really helps keep my back in good shape.&nbsp; I doubt that the massage this place gives could compare with the massage I get for $30 for half an hour which also includes hot stone massage.

				Doing a bit of laundry on Sunday I stopped by to see if I could get some love for a sore shoulder muscle.&nbsp; Well, I certainly hope the erotic services are better than the $40 I wasted on a half hour (if it was a full half hour) of poorly executed knot-rubbing!&nbsp; Cash Only - prior to services - AND she shook me down hard for a tip before I even stepped out of the room.<br /><br />I don&#039;t really care if they offer &quot;happy ending&quot; or not, as long as the outside of the joint is presentable and somewhat respectable-looking, (which it is).&nbsp; I have more of a problem with bad service, high prices, cash only, and getting the impression that I am not the type of client they are looking for.&nbsp; I won&#039;t go back. <br />

				Funny, you say you have no problem with the fact that it&#039;s a happy ending type place and then complain about the very things that come along with it being a happy ending type place (ie you not being the type of customer they&#039;re looking for, shaking you down for a tip, cash only, pay up front, crappy massage). Did you think that normal, respectable places just happen to do that on the side too? Most licensed massage therapists or people who specialize in massage probably wouldn&#039;t have to resort to going to work in a place where they would have to degrade themselves in that way, they can probably make a living without doing that.

				O.K.,&nbsp; hold on---&nbsp; People are going there for real massages?&nbsp; &nbsp;That must be some massage, what do they do, keep rubbing your back or shoulder in up and down motion for half hour?&nbsp;

				So glad to report that I walked on 24th avenue over the weekend and the place is gone.&nbsp; A very sketchy sign sits in the window that says:<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;We moved, call a sketchy cell phone number &quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />I know when I called the 114th precinct community affairs, they told me they were looking into it as a priority.&nbsp; Maybe they had an effect or all of the neighbors working together against what was a sketchy place near a school made them decide to leave. Whatever the reason, glad to see they are out.&nbsp; Kudos to everyone who spoke up.&nbsp;
