				I&#039;m a member and an organizer of a mom-group/playgroup in Astoria.&nbsp; I know that when I was a new mom, I was looking for groups and there was no easy place to find them.&nbsp; I thought that it would be nice to make a list on Astorians.&nbsp; I&#039;ll put down the info for the ones that I know of, so please chime in if anyone else wants to contribute.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; <strong>la leche league: for help and support with breast feeding:</strong><br /><br />Long Island City--YMCA<br />NEW TIME! 1st Wednesday of the month, 10:30 am - 12:30 pm<br />32-23 Queens Blvd, Long Island City, NY 11101<br />Multi-Purpose Room<br />Take the 7 train to 33rd Street--one stop past Queensboro Plaza, or Queens Blvd buses Q32 or Q60.

Entry to the church parking lot is located on Crescent Street immediately south of 30th Avenue, next to the white house on the right.<br />Primary Leader: Ariel<br /><br /><strong>here are some groups that you can join &quot;online&quot;. </strong> Though I think that these groups at times have had a lot of members who arranged to meet each other in person for playdates and to get together, most of the online messages are to give support and ask questions about local events, doctors, daycares, etc.&nbsp; <strong>Very good resources!&nbsp; </strong><br /><br />here&#039;s my list so far:<br />queensmoms http://groups.yahoo.com/group/QueensMoms/?yguid=201835232 (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/QueensMoms/?yguid=201835232)<br />astoriamomsanddads http://groups.yahoo.com/group/astoriamomsanddads/?yguid=201835232 (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/astoriamomsanddads/?yguid=201835232)<br />astoriamamis&nbsp; &nbsp;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AstoriaMamis/?yguid=201835232 (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AstoriaMamis/?yguid=201835232)<br /><br /><br />these are more active groups that I know of in our area:<br /><br />Astoria Stay at Home Moms Meetup Group http://sahm.meetup.com/817/ (http://sahm.meetup.com/817/) (I am a member and an organizer) $12 a year for dues- to cover site costs, paypal, big group events.&nbsp; Not just stay at home moms, though most of the events are during the week.&nbsp; We also have mom night out events, a book club, and some family events on the weekend (and in the summer, we meet at the beer garden during some week nights).&nbsp; It is a support group and a playgroup for moms (Dads can come to most events, but are not allowed to join as primary members).<br /><br />Family Group -- LIC based, but the organizer arranges for events all over the city.&nbsp; NYC Frugal Fun for Families http://parents.meetup.com/670/ (http://parents.meetup.com/670/) <br /><br />Little in the City -- Long Island City based group&nbsp; http://parents.meetup.com/377/ (http://parents.meetup.com/377/) <br /><br /><strong>I have to go play with my kids, but will add some more groups later.</strong><br /><br />

				Hi Alexa,<br /><br />A lot of the new-mom events are at Astoria park--most are in the morning.&nbsp; You bring yourself, your baby, a blanket and a snack and just hang out.&nbsp; There are also usually meetups in cafes.&nbsp; <br /><br />The stay-at-home meetup group is really great for meeting people -- then you can make plans with other moms to hang out, get support.&nbsp; I work full time-- the group is definitely a mix of people who freelance, work fixed days part-time, work full time, or are home full time.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				Oh-- I just realized that you asked what people talk about or do...<br /><br />What do we talk about?&nbsp; Talk about our babies- yes, as people tend to do once they&#039;ve had a baby.&nbsp; Sharing things that worked for getting the baby to sleep, or eat, or stop crying, or, just venting a bit about how really hard it is to take care of an infant.&nbsp; There really is a lot of getting and giving support, too.&nbsp; It can feel really great to get to talk to some other moms.&nbsp; <br /><br />And of course, talking to another adult is really fantastic if you&#039;ve not been able to.&nbsp; And there&#039;s plenty of NOT talking about babies and children, too......<br /><br />What do we do?&nbsp; Playdates, meetups on a picnic blanket for moms with babies that don&#039;t move, or taking that very portable little baby to a cafe.&nbsp; For all moms, we have a book club (but really, an excuse to try another restaurant and go out to eat), a blog, we go out to the beer garden every few weeks in the summer at night---during the week, otherwise we&#039;d never get enough tables.&nbsp; We joined the 2 coves community garden and have a pretty kick ass plot, we&#039;ve put in a permit for a family picnic in astoria park, we have huge parties very few months, our members host playdates at their homes, and in the winter-- members post weekly playgroups (trinity church, redeemer, steinway reformed), we have meetups in the playgrounds and parks, in museums (one of our moms is a curator and she took us on a tour of her exhibit, we have moms who are artists), go to the zoo, fundraise for breast cancer and hospitals, we have had members give classes on health and nutrition, we had a schools symposium and gave each other info on the schools in astoria (and are working on a bigger one in the fall for the public, with real officials who can speak about the schools) we go on stroller walks for some exercise.....<br /><br />It&#039;s a way to make a social network for yourself-- and your child-- of friends in Astoria who have kids.&nbsp; I was floored at how alone I suddenly felt when I first had a child and had no other friends in Astoria with kids.&nbsp; Fine, maybe it sounds dorky, but I feel like I have an extended family now-- my sons have &quot;pals&quot; and I have friends that I love to spend time with.

				Alexa,<br /><br />Sorry, the meetup sahm group is private, so I can&#039;t post those events here.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you don&#039;t want to join that group, you could try some of the other online groups that I mentioned--- some might have &quot;new mom&quot; get-togethers.<br /><br />I have no idea about the freeze peach event on their calendar (I work during the day)....... If they are welcoming parents with babies, then that&#039;s great!&nbsp; I&#039;ll add it to my list of &quot;baby/kid friendly places&quot; in Astoria......<br /><br />If you don&#039;t want to join any groups at all, you could meet other moms by going to a class--- like the parent/baby yoga class at the yoga room (and there&#039;s going to be a class at astoria park), or to Megan&#039;s event at Sai Organic (she&#039;s fabulous) and there should be other very nice, cool moms at those events.&nbsp; Music for Aardvarks is at Steinway Reformed Church, and that&#039;s a fun class (with very friendly, nice moms and dads there) and the classes are in the mornings....I brought Oscar there when he was 3 months or so.<br /><br />--sarah<br /><br />

				The very active Astoria Moms Meetup is reopening for new members (but only for two weeks???)<br />If you are a mom or will be a mom in the next few months you may want to check this group out.&nbsp; <br />They have 10 - 20 organized gatherings every week in the neighborhood (most for moms with the little ones, some for the whole family and some for moms only) and they run a great message board for the members. <br /><br />They&#039;re only opening the membership from Nov 1st - Nov 14th.&nbsp; <br />http://www.meetup.com/ASAHMGroup/

				The &quot;stay-at-home-moms&quot; meetup group has reopened again.&nbsp; <br /><br />Some more details that I wrote for another forum:<br /><br />In the winter months there are on average 12 - 15<br />meetings/playdates... whatever you want to call them - PER WEEK!! And<br />in the summer months it&#039;s more like 20 - 25.<br /><br />Meetings can be for mom and baby (or toddler), moms only, whole family<br />and there have been a couple of dads meetups too.<br /><br />It&#039;s called &quot;stay at home moms&quot; - but many of the moms are NOT staying<br />home. Some work p.t others f.t. and many work at home beyond being a<br />mom.<br /><br />And the women I&#039;ve met through this group are FANTASTIC! These are<br />your typical New Yor... er... no. - ASTORIAN women. Interesting,<br />educated, diverse, warm, friendly and so welcoming.<br /><br />Why the $$ you might ask? There are some event that cost $$ for the<br />organizers. Last summer at a picnic there was a face painter and<br />rented sno cone machine and clown. I think there might be a fee<br />charged for the room for the holiday party (and maybe Halloween too).<br />Whatever the money is going for - $12 for the year is pretty nominal<br />for all that you get in return.<br /><br />Why is the group CLOSED to new members so frequently?<br />I&#039;m not sure - I think it has to do with membership management.<br /><br />Just so you know - I&#039;m NOT one of the organizers of the group. But I<br />did lobby them to get the group reopened to new members. I know that<br />if I was cooped up all winter with few options of things to do with<br />new (or older) baby - I&#039;d be going out of my mind!!!<br /><br />Anywho... obviously I&#039;m a huge fan.<br /><br />For more information about what we do - read the above thread - it&#039;s described pretty well. <br /><br />They&#039;re only open to new members for a couple of weeks - so join now.<br /><br />http://www.meetup.com/ASAHMGroup/<br /><br /><br />

				Thanks for posting all the info on the group. I have to say, i got a little turned off by the &quot;closed for new members&quot; idea and now the limited time to open as well. Not sure what the purpose of that is other than a possible turn off for some new parents who might have been looking for a group to get together, only to be told membership is closed. Well, they must have their reasons. <br /><br />Thanks for putting the information up for all to see.

				I wanted to add my 2 cents as to why the SAHM group closed periodically.<br /><br />The organizers are also parents.&nbsp; &nbsp;A few of the organizers were expecting new babies and we decided to close the group TEMPORARILY so that no prospective members would be left&nbsp; waiting for a response.&nbsp; &nbsp;The decision was purely due to administrative duties , and the fact that we did not wish to neglect them or new members while we adjusted to our own growing families.<br /><br />The group is now open, and plans to be open for a while.&nbsp; &nbsp;We hope you join us.<br /><br />

				There&#039;s a meetup now scheduled for some upcoming sunday mornings.&nbsp; Look at the calendar to see if you could go.&nbsp; There are some &quot;big group&quot; events too, on the weekend. Those are hard, sometimes, to meet up with others-- especially if you don&#039;t know too many in the group.<br /><br />When you go to your first meetup, my advice for you is if you have not met anyone else in the group-- put your cellphone # on your rsvp (and take the organizer&#039;s!) so that you can find everyone and be found.<br /><br />The problem with the organizers just making an event on a weekend without getting specific time/dates/places that are good for you is that it still won&#039;t be *perfect* for you.&nbsp; It will be during nap time, you don&#039;t want to go to that park-- it&#039;s too far, you have plans that particular weekend, etc.&nbsp; Weekend meetups must not be something that most of the organizers are able to host, right now.&nbsp; So, volunteer to host!<br /><br />If you&#039;re planning on going to a cafe/museum/playground on a weekend anyway, so why not make it an &quot;event&quot; by emailing the idea to an organizer?&nbsp; You would be the host-- and it would be exactly when you want it, and where you want it.&nbsp; <br /><br />For instance: (sent to an organizer)<br />i&#039;d like to host a park meetup<br />Date: Sat - April 11<br />Time: 11:00-12:30 (I have to leave then for lunch/nap)<br />Place: Astoria Park Playground--- I&#039;ll be by the benches near the swings<br />here&#039;s my cell # ___________ (and if you wanted to, you could ask for the other parents to call you so that you could definitely find each other if it was crowded)<br />my child is named and is _____ years old (if you want to meet other parents with same aged kids-- if not, then it does not matter)<br /><br />The point of ASAHM and other meetup/playgroups whatever is for you to get to meet some other people, then make friends, and also get some playdates for your kids.&nbsp; There are other working moms in the group, and moms whose husbands work on sat/sun and would love to go to the park or anywhere with some other parents.&nbsp; So, suggest a date, and time, and place that works for you, and I&#039;m sure that you will get to meet other parents in Astoria.<br /><br />Your other option is to make your own thing-- start a free yahoo or google group for working moms in astoria-- make a standing weekend event: noon at astoria park, or brunch at a cafe that is baby friendly.&nbsp; Even a quick coffee with other moms/parents once a week if time is an issue.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure that there are other people who would join you!&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />The problem is that the ASAHM group *is* mostly stay at home moms.&nbsp; The name does not lie.&nbsp; I am a WOHM, but home by 4, and can go to late afternoon meetups.&nbsp; I host some, and will go to park ones this spring, and sometimes host/go to events at night (without kids!)&nbsp; And, you&#039;d be surprised-- even with the many events during the week, there are SAHM members who say that there are still no dates/times that work for them-- you can&#039;t please everyone!<br /><br />The dues cover the cost of the meetup site, and also helps pay for large group events.&nbsp; All of the organizers are volunteers, and VERY busy moms- some SAHMs, some WAHM or WOHMs, but all BUSY just like you!<br /><br />Hope to see you around, on a weekend meetup,<br />Sarah<br /><br />&nbsp;

				WOW... so I was <em>just </em>removed from the SAHM group.&nbsp; It says due to inactivity but me thinks it&#039;s due to my post here alerting them to the fact that I hadn&#039;t attended any meetups.&nbsp; The timing is just too perfect to think otherwise and I use the same name in both places.&nbsp; The email said I never responded to an email asking if I still wanted to be a member which I call bullshit on.&nbsp; I never got anything of the sort and I would&#039;ve known since that group sends 4-5 emails per day.&nbsp; None asking if I wanted to retain membership.&nbsp; I understand they have a one event per month rule but I hadn&#039;t attended anything in six months, why boot now?&nbsp; Also, what&#039;s the sense in reducing membership at all?&nbsp; Isn&#039;t is better to have a large group, more events/activities?&nbsp; I never even got the chance to set something up myself on a weekend if that was the direction I wanted to go in.&nbsp; Between my axing and their initial closed door policy, I think I&#039;ll save my $12 and just set up playdates on my own.<br /><br />PS - I know it&#039;s for SAHM&#039;s but it says here that there&#039;s all types of mom&#039;s on there and when I first joined, I was also told there were events for working moms.&nbsp; The truth is, there&#039;s just not.&nbsp;

				Kokowillis- <br />They are cleaning out the list and removing everyone who hasn&#039;t paid dues and/or attended events.&nbsp; I was removed too-- I know it wasn&#039;t personal, and I don&#039;t think your removal was because of your post.&nbsp; <br /><br />That being said, I agree that a more inclusive Astoria Parents Group would be a welcome meetup.&nbsp; The SAHM moms group really doesn&#039;t cater to working parents, and is not particularly geared to parents who work part-time either.&nbsp; I have long harbored hopes that Astorians.com is a forum parents in the area could use sort of more like how the Park Slope Parents site functions -- to really respond to each other, set up events, etc., but I don&#039;t think it happens.&nbsp; <br /><br />Being a parent of a small child is nervewracking and difficult.&nbsp; I&#039;m glad some parents have found a way to deal with it.&nbsp; I wish there were more resources for working parents too.&nbsp; Perhaps we could work together on that.&nbsp;

				Hi there kokowillis,<br /><br />I am the organizer of the ASAHM group and I am the one who removed you from the group.<br /><br />For the record, I have <strong>no</strong> idea who you are based on your screen name here--all our members are asked to provide their real name, so that is what I would know you by.<br /><br />I do not appreciate, nor deserve, the insinuation that we remove anyone for <strong>any</strong> reason other than inactivity or for non-payment of dues. If you must know, this is something the organizers have been working on for a long time. I have recently taken over as group organizer, and we have been planning to get on track with our members&#039; attendance for some time (which is why you were removed only recently even though you have not attended any events for months). I can assure you that I sent <strong>everyone</strong> a &quot;warning&quot; email last week--if you&#039;d like, you can email me with your name and I will gladly forward you your copy. It was a difficult decision to make to institute this &quot;attendance policy,&quot; but in the end, we&#039;re all glad that we did. <br /><br />As for your statement about it being better if the group is large, there is no sense in having 215 members when 60 of them are inactive. I would rather have a group of 150 moms who all know each other, than 300 moms who have never met. We are, after all, a MEET UP group. We are a group of moms that are in it to become friends, know one another, and build a strong parenting community. We share more than play dates--we share our, and our children&#039;s, lives. When we continuously build numbers without participation, then we run the risk of becoming an anonymous online group, and none of our very active members are happy with that. And it is an absolutely true statement that even with the number and versatility of events that we have, many SAHM mothers still cannot find the time to fit us in. We shouldn&#039;t have to beg anyone to come to our events--you joined out of your own accord. You get out of the group <strong>exactly</strong> what you put into it. <br /><br />As for our initial &quot;closed door policy,&quot; that decision was also made after much difficult deliberation, and was made only because at the time, the number of members exceeded the organizers&#039; capabilities. We are, after all, mothers, and whether we work or not, we are <strong>all</strong> just as busy as you. I was a working mother until very recently, and I still work extremely hard to balance it all. The more members we have, the more chances there are that we receive complaints identical to yours, because truthfully, you cannot make everyone happy. All of our organizers work <strong>extremely</strong> hard to come up with fun events and activities at all hours of the day, and all days of the week. We are more than happy to do this for free, as we gain something more valuable than money--but when people either don&#039;t show up continuously, or complain without really producing any alternatives, it just plain stinks. <br /><br />For what it&#039;s worth, a little more than a year ago, I received an email stating that due to <strong>my</strong> inactivity in the group, I was running the risk of being removed. I was still working at the time, and while I was initially very hurt, when I stepped back and realized the intent of the letter I received, and thought about all the hard work and dedication that the organizers put into the group, I got it together, became one of the most active members, then an assistant organizer, and now I am <strong>the</strong> organizer. <br /><br />I care about our group deeply--each of the women I have met has had an impact in my life. Just this past Saturday we had my son&#039;s 4th birthday party--and all his friends there were through moms I had met as a member of ASAHM. The group is part of my heart and soul, and I put my heart and soul into it. Reading posts like yours is like a slap in the face, quite frankly. <br /><br />We had an organizer meeting this past week (because yes, we <strong>do</strong> take it <strong>that</strong> seriously), and since at least one of our organizers will be working outside the home, we are hoping that we will have more events to cater to working moms. I can guarantee you, however, that there will be a working mom somewhere that will feel the events are not appropriate for her. If you had complaints or suggestions, how come none of us heard from you? All you had to do was click on our name to send an email. Clearly you have some time to send an email, as you find the time to post on these message boards. <br /><br />And one last note--I <strong>hated</strong> having to remove the people I did. I don&#039;t want to remove anyone. We are not snooty or exclusive--our attendance expectation is posted clearly right on our front page. It&#039;s unfortunate that you are disappointed, and it&#039;s unfortunate that you didn&#039;t get a chance to experience how amazing our group really is.

				Anastasia, I appreciate your lengthy response.&nbsp; I posted here and a day or so later I&#039;m removed.&nbsp; Coincidence?&nbsp; Likely, but I hope you can see where I made the connection.&nbsp; And I apologize, I went through my deleted items and saw the message.&nbsp; I was receiving about 5 emails a day (!) from the group so your message was deleted without fully reading.&nbsp; <br /><br />You had a lot of good points but I really don&#039;t want to get into a back and forth since a) I&#039;m not a member there anymore so really, what&#039;s the point? and b)&nbsp; I&#039;m typing this while eating lunch at my desk!&nbsp; I really only want to address one item... the fact that I must have time to email the group with suggestions when I &quot;clearly have some time to send an email, as I find the time to post on these message boards&quot;.&nbsp; My post count here is under 20 and I&#039;ve been a member for about a year so that&#039;s about how much time I have to post.&nbsp; I never sent an email to the organizers of the group because, honestly, I never had the time.&nbsp; I&#039;m here posting now because I&#039;ve been engaged into a dialogue but really, it&#039;s not like I&#039;m on here everyday.&nbsp; Or even once a week for that matter.&nbsp; Funny enough, that pic of my son you see in my profile pic is from OCTOBER!&nbsp; As a mom, that should tell you a lot about my activity here.&nbsp; If I were here more, I&#039;d have an updated picture, no question.<br /><br />I guess I wanted to address two items, here&#039;s the second.&nbsp; I hate that assumptions are always made about SAHM&#039;s, WOHM&#039;s, WAFHM&#039;s... can&#039;t we all say we work hard??&nbsp; Or maybe not mention it at all since parenting, no matter what you do for income, is HARD.&nbsp; I&#039;ll get off my soapbox but really, that&#039;s a pet peeve of mine.&nbsp; I know that you and other SAHM&#039;s &quot;are <strong>all </strong> just as busy as&quot; I am.&nbsp; You didn&#039;t need to even mention it.&nbsp; Or bold it.<br /><br />So anyway!&nbsp; My lunch is ingested - congrats on deciding to be a SAHM and taking over the group.&nbsp; Sounds like you have a clear vision and direction for the group.&nbsp; It&#039;s unfortunate that due to the number of emails I received, I missed my chance to stay but honestly, and I think we can both agree, it wasn&#039;t really a place for me.
