				Upon Zeno's recommendation, I'm creating a comics thread. There is a small contingent of comic book creators and readers in Astoria, even one comic book store. I'll update those in this post.<br /><br />STORES:<br /><br />Silver Age Comics<br />2255 31st Street Suite 2, Astoria, NY 11105 (just off the Ditmars station)<br /><br />PUBLISHERS:<br /><br />Dreamchilde Press<br />Title - QUANTUM: Rock of Ages<br />http://dreamchildepress.com<br />http://quantumcomic.net<br /><br />Enemi Entertainment<br />Titles - Pending<br /><br />Neo Reality Press<br />Titles - Mind's Overflow Anthology<br />http://13wasps.com<br /><br />Please let this serve as an open topic for anyone interested in the subject of comics. Share your favorites or get turned on to new books. Discuss comics as literature and their influence on pop culture.<br /><br />By the way, COMICS ARE FOR GIRLS TOO. Ask me about it.<br /><br />Happy chatting,<br />Philip

				I was exposed osmotically to comics when I was in college. I was friends with a bunch of avid graphic novel fans and got turned on to Frank Miller (Dark Night, Ronin), Sandman, The Crow and The Watchmen. I actually own an old copy of the single-volume Watchmen. Used to read Heavy Metal occasionally back in the day.<br /><br />That's about it.<br /><br />I loved the art and writing, but was too into instant gratification to enjoy serialized stories.<br /><br />I'd like to check out some other titles. I'm more into a compelling story and character arc than artwork, which is why I find The Watchmen so effing brilliant. But when I swing by a comics section my eyes just glaze over. It's too overwhelming and I have little patience for spending time with a story that turns out to be crap. Where to begin?

				Howard Chaykin's &quot;American Flagg!&quot; was one of my favorites. I like his editorials as well. I also read Heavy Metal (it was the only thing available in the hick town where I grew up within bicycle riding distance) though I haven't read any DC Comics since I was a toddler. I haven't read that much though as this hobby can become quite expensive and plus I had to take the train into Manhattan to Forbidden Planet (which has now sadly discontinued it's sci-fi and fantasy paperback stock). I do plan to get into it again though, and being that there is a store so close by, this will facilitate greatly with my self-directed self-imposed paradigm shift.<br /><br />Here is a graphic novel in progress that you can view for free on the net, chapter by chapter as it is written, for any Orwell fans (or detractors) out there: http://www.1984comic.com/demo.php<br /><br />-zeno content free

				My brother did his thesis on The Watchmen. Personally, I love the story but I can't stand the drawing style.<br /><br />Who are these Astorian comic creators you mentioned??

				Just wanted to drop a line that the latest issue of QUANTUM: Rock of Ages is now available.<br /><br />Here's the official press release:<br /><br />FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br /><br /><strong>The comic book that almost wasn't. </strong><br /><br /><em>New York small press comic book publisher Dreamchilde Press continues cross-time adventure in spite of increasingly conservative age.</em><br /><br />Hailed by readers, reviewers, and comic book pros alike, <strong>QUANTUM: Rock of Ages</strong> has established itself as solid Sci-Fi reading. The sixth installment of the series is now available and raising the eyebrows of all who read it. The content of QUANTUM #6 is so hot, it almost didn't see print at all.<br /><br />&quot;Everything was ‘go’ for press weeks ago until I got a call from the printer saying they wouldn't run the book,&quot; says publisher/writer Philip Clark. &quot;I knew the scene in question might be controversial, but I had no idea it would cause such a fuss.&quot; <br /><br />As a matter of fact, the print company sited a sex toy shown in the issue as the reason they chose not to print the book. Continued pleading from the publisher warranted a meeting with the print company’s management and legal counsel. &quot;We talked about covering up the item in question, but I felt strongly that the scene should stand on its own artistic merit. What got me was that they didn't object to any of the nudity and we weren't showing any type of penetration. In other words, this wasn’t porn.&quot; <br /><br />Clark was forced to take the book to a different printer. “It was nice to see free press eventually win the day. I’m just surprised at how easily censorship can rear its head, particularly in this age.&quot;<br /><br />Part “Clerks,” part “Sliders,” <strong>QUANTUM: Rock of Ages</strong> follows the adventures of Nick Vargas, a jaded musician turned unwitting hero. Nick is given super powers and taken on the ultimate cross-time thrill ride by a bizarre gemstone, the Quantum Silica. During his quest he encounters other characters that are also affected by the fragmented &quot;Quantum.&quot; Each fragment offers a unique power to Nick and his counterparts, and they must band together to save the universe from peril. Toss in a diabolical nemesis, some quirky pop-culture humor, and QUANTUM makes for a highly enjoyable read. <br /><br /><em>“This is the type of comic book that is impossible to put down.” -Silver Bullet Comics<br /><br />“Philip Clark is an up and coming creator to watch out for.” &nbsp;-David Mack<br /><br />“Fun, utterly unpredictable, and marching to its own beat.” &nbsp;-Newsarama<br /><br />&quot;This is the sort of thing I wish Marvel and DC could do more frequently.&quot; &nbsp;-Four Color Explosion</em><br /><br />You can now find out what the fuss is all about. <strong>QUANTUM: Rock of Ages #6</strong> (32 pages, $2.99) is available to order from the QUANTUM website, Cold Cut Distribution, FM Distribution, The SPA website, MIdtown Comics and Jim Hanley’s Universe.<br /><br />More information can be found at http://quantumcomic.net.<br />Review copies are available upon request.<br /><br />###

				Hi DreamchildNYC,<br /><br />I have obtained #2 &amp; #6 from Silver Age Comics and they are awesome. #6 is hilarious and though it still irks me that the printer wouldn't handle it I must confess that my initial reaction was just a tad unbalanced. It would be equally bad if a free enterprises were forced to take on a job they didn't want to. The trend towards censorship still disturbs me however.<br /><br />Unfortunately the Drunkduck server is down so I can't catch up on this exciting Quantum timeline... You know what would be really cool? If I could read them in their original form after purchasing them from Silver Age Comics! :-)

				It's awesome to see comic writers working in the independent market. :) I'm percolating a short story right now and will probably work on it over the winter for submission somewhere once it finishes...
