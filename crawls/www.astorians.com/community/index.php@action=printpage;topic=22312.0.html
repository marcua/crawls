				I&#039;d like to encourage all parents of young children to early school-aged in Astoria to attend this event.&nbsp; Have an infant and want to get the low-down on schools in Astoria?&nbsp; It&#039;s never too early!<br /><br /><br />We will have representatives from many area daycares and preschools in Astoria and the immediate area, as well as representatives from <br />many schools- both parochial and public (if we could not get an official from a public school, we asked a well-informed parent with children at that school to be a representative).&nbsp; All area charter schools will also be represented.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />We hope that this becomes an annual event (though much earlier in the school year next time).&nbsp; This is a free event- Holistic Moms of Queens and the Astoria Moms Meetup Group feel that it &quot;takes a village&quot; to raise kids and we are interested in gaining and sharing information about education opportunities here in Queens.<br /><br /><br />Hope to see you there!<br /><br />

				My husband went and got a lot of useful information.&nbsp; &nbsp;Various neighborhood schools had tables there with pamphlets, etc.&nbsp; There was also an educational handout with a lot of good information; I can scan it to you if you send me your email address.

				We attended this last year, and I just noticed the announcement on their facebook page about the 3rd annual Astoria School Symposium. It is happening in few days. I too encourage all of you with kids to attend, very useful community events.<br /><br />
