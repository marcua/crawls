				Kinda funny I am reading this post as I have been thinking about getting back into cleaning, very very part time. I am not totally sure, however to inform you all, I have been cleaning houses (Mostly city peoples weekend houses 5-6 BR&#39;s, 3-4 Baths, in upstate NY, CT) since I was 14 y.o., I am now almost 30. I did it all the way up till I moved down here almost four years ago and enjoyed it as it was great exercise and the $$ was GREAAAT. <br />I will post for sure once I decide if I want to go through with it, I feel that it would be a breeze to clean apt.&#39;s or houses compared to the mansions I use to clean. I also use to clean for the some of the resident from the nursing home I use to work at, which they had cute little cottages. I am just blabbering here, however if it strikes any interest in anyone, it may make me go for it as I could def. use a lil&#39; extra Ka ching and the exercise, lol.

				Well, I just saw this thread.<br />I am a student from europe who has been cleaning apartments to earn extra money for the college. I live in Astoria and am still available for one or maybe two apartments.<br />The people I clean for are very happy with me.<br />If anyone is interested you can write me a massage and I`ll get back to you.<br />Thanks.

				Lorrie,<br /><br />I saw your recommendation for Fabiana and gave her a call.&nbsp; My regular cleaning person had to return home to Poland due to illness in the family so I was without help for a while.&nbsp; Fabiana was very accomodating.&nbsp; She was able to help me out in this duration and did a nice job!&nbsp; I will definitely keep her number in case my regular cleaning person is no longer able to make the trip to Astoria. <br /><br />By the way, sorry for the imposition about the keys!<br /><br />Julie

				Sorry I don&#039;t have a recommendation, just a question....<br /><br />I have never had a cleaning person in my life and have no idea what something like this would cost.&nbsp; Is it possible to just have someone come only &quot;as needed&quot; rather than on a regular schedule?&nbsp; Normally I don&#039;t mind cleaning that much, but there are times when you need a break!<br /><br />I appreciate any knowledge anyone may have regarding this.

				Great to know Lorrie.&nbsp; I hope you don&#039;t mind if I give Fabiana a call in a couple of weeks.&nbsp; My maternity leave is over and I have to return to work in a week.&nbsp; (Bummer.)&nbsp; But I will definitely need the help.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never had a cleaning lady before and would love to try it out.&nbsp;

				I have someone who comes sometimes every other week, but more so on an as needed basis. She needs to be told specifically what to do, but once you set her up she is good to go. You can pm me ifyou aren interested and i&#039;ll hook a brotha up.

I figured she would call the Board of Health on me. She just walked around, did some mental figuring and quoted a fee. I&#039;ve used her regularly since. I find her to be patient, especially with the dogs who can be a PITA because they think she is there to visit them, and funny.
