				Are you able to get up early in the morning?&nbsp; If so, my tip is to get up, eat breakfast and be at the park when it opens.&nbsp; Actually, the front section of the MK opens earlier than the rest of the park so you can go and eat breakfast there and you&#39;ll already be in there when the rest of the park opens.<br /><br />Then, in the early afternoon when it gets super-crowded and super-hot, leave the park, lounge at your hotel pool, eat dinner and go back to the park in the early evening, say around 5 pm.&nbsp; In the MK, don&#39;t miss the Main Street Electrical Parade.&nbsp; The Ecpot fireworks are great, too.<br /><br />If you get a chance, take the monorail to the Polynesian Village hotel and spend an hour roaming around the grounds--beautiful.&nbsp; Wear your bathing suit and check to see if they&#39;ll let you use their pool/beach, seeing as you&#39;re staying in a Disney hotel.<br /><br />Make sure you spend at least one full day at the Disney-MGM studios and spend some time outside, don&#39;t just run from indoor thing to indoor thing.&nbsp; Unless, of course, it&#39;s raining or unbearably hot.&nbsp; --by the way, you probably already know this but it rains almost every afternoon for about 10 minutes.<br /><br />Take pictures!!!

				As far as warnings, the food is obscenely expensive and, for the most part, mediocre.&nbsp; Prepare yourself now so it won&#39;t be a surprise.&nbsp; The food in the international section of Ecpot tends to be better quality, albeit no less expensive.&nbsp; They pull a pretty good Guinness at the faux-British pub.&nbsp; I said pretty good, not phenomenal.

				We didn&#39;t get park &quot;hopper&quot; tickets but will we be allowed to leave and reenter the same park on the same day?&nbsp; I should find that out.&nbsp; We got the standard 3 day pass for the parks.&nbsp; The parks seem so huge that I think we would spend the whole day in each one no problem.&nbsp; But it would be nice to know if we could go back to the hotel and&nbsp; come back to the same park the same day.<br /><br />Thanks Goldfish Boy!!&nbsp; Those are great tips!

				Aw!&nbsp; I didn&#39;t mean to cause jealousy!&nbsp; I was always so jealous in school when I heard people were going.&nbsp; I&#39;ve never been ever.&nbsp; And I guess we just want to treat ourselves to some fun for once.<br /><br />Any thoughts on Seaworld?&nbsp; I assume a cab would have to be called if I want to go to other non-Disney parks, from a Disney resort?

				Ok, I&#39;ll fess up. I&#39;m a Disney geek. My boyfirend &amp; I went there a few years back and had so much fun, we decided to go back again this past September with my mother &amp; stepfather for a week. <br /><br />(beware - long post ahead!)<br /><br />We stayed at the Boardwalk Inn, so I don&#39;t really know much about the All-Star Music Hotel. But I can tell you that since you are staying on property, you will have early access to one park each morning. Some mornings they allow guests into the Magic Kingdom at 8am, sometimes it&#39;s Animal Kingdom or Epcot, etc. This kicks SO much ass since you get to beat the crowds and relax a bit before the mad rush. Your hotel will have info on which parks are opening early when you check in.<br /><br />If you get into the Magic Kingdom early, 90% of the people waiting will make a beeline for the &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; ride. If you really want to get on this ride, early morning is the best time. Once afternoon hits, the line gets crazy. And it doesn&#39;t help that it seems to break down a lot.<br /><br />Some of the best restaurants are in the park hotels. We liked Spoodles (at the Boardwalk Inn) and Boma (Animal Kingdom Lodge). I <em>highly</em> recommend Boma, but have your hotel make reservations if you decide to go...it gets really busy. (That goes for all resort restaurants.)<br /><br />Even though it&#39;s pretty far from the rest of the parks and hotels, definitely get over to the Animal Kingdom Lodge. Besides being a beautiful hotel, there&#39;s a wildlife area in the back where giraffes, zebras, bongos, wildebeats, etc roam around. And if you get there at night, they&#39;ll even give you a pair of nightvision goggles so you can watch the animals in the dark. <br /><br />Sea World is nice, but definitely much more laid back than WDW. I&#39;m not sure what your speed is when in a park, but we knocked out SW in just a couple hours. (It was too hot when we went to sit outside and watch more than a couple of the marine life shows.) You&#39;ll have to get a private cab to SW, since Disney won&#39;t provide free any transportation to a non-Disney park. There are usually cabs waiting outside of each hotel, so you shouldn&#39;t have a problem getting one. Getting a cab back to your resort after SW also shouldn&#39;t be a problem. I couldn&#39;t figure out how the rates worked in the cabs...all I know is that it seemed a bit steep. It might have been about $20+ each way, but don&#39;t quote me on that. At least you won&#39;t be going to Universal, where our cab ride back to our resort cost us a ridiculous $65 since we got caught in a traffic jam on the interstate.... :x<br /><br />The fireworks at Epcot are really lovely. If you can, get a late dinner at the British restaurant in Epcot and sit out on the deck. You&#39;ll be able to watch the fireworks and water show in comfort, without anyone pushing you around.<br /><br />I didn&#39;t see it listed, but if you go to MGM, <strong>DO NOT MISS</strong> the Tower of Terror. Best.Ride.Ever. I think we hit that ride about 10 times in a row one day.&nbsp; :mrgreen: <br /><br />Oh and if you want to have fun while walking around, try to pick out the Hidden Mickeys http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Mickey (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Mickey) around the parks and hotels. It was just something we all had fun doing while waiting in the (sometimes) long lines. <br /><br />Downtown Disney has some ok restaurants, I guess, but the shopping was the best part. We spent hours there. Pleasure Island, on the other hand, was frat boy hell when we went a few years back. I don&#39;t recommend it at all unless you are into loud, pumping house music and rude comments from drunk 19 year olds. Oh and don&#39;t bother with DisneyQuest, if it&#39;s still there. A few years back it was a lot of fun...an arcade for adults! But last time we were sad to see it was a bit run down. Rumor has it that it&#39;s going to be closed at some point this year to make way for an ESPN Zone or some nonsense. <br /><br />If you want, you can check out my Disney pics on Flickr. http://www.flickr.com/photos/snoodette/sets/72157594291550412/ (http://www.flickr.com/photos/snoodette/sets/72157594291550412/)&nbsp; :-)<br />And if you have any questions, feel free to ask away. I know I&#39;m totally showing myself to be a major dork here, but I&#39;m not ashamed to say I loved WDW and SOOO want to go back again in a couple years.<br /><br />Have fun!!! And yes, I&#39;m jealous too!<br />

				Oh my god!! These are exactly the kind of tips I want!&nbsp; Thanks so much Snoodette!!&nbsp; I love to hear about everyone&#39;s favorite ride and restaurants.&nbsp; Right now we have reservations at LeOriginale de Roma at the Italian Pavilion in Epkot and Planet Hollywood in Downtown Disney.&nbsp; We were thinking about going to the fish restaurant on the Boardwalk, instead of Spoodles since we already have reservations at the Italian Pavilion.&nbsp; I read a good review about it in Lonely Planet, has anyone eaten at either Roma or Planet Hollywood?&nbsp; I have to look into those extra magic hours and plan our days accordingly.&nbsp; Our Music Resort is in the Animal Kingdom so maybe&nbsp; the Animal Kingdom Lodge will be closer for us... that sounds awesome!!!

				Don&#39;t forget about FAST PASSES or whatever they call them.&nbsp; Get a fast pass in the morning for one ride, and go to another ride.&nbsp; For example at MGM, get one for Tower of Terror and then go on the Rock &quot;n&quot; Roller Coaster.&nbsp; Same goes for Magic Kingdom... Get one for Space Mountain and then go on something else.&nbsp; Splash Mountain may be a good thing to do first thing that morning because of the lines.<br /><br />When I went, we did Epcot in a day and it is my favorite of all the parks.&nbsp; It is too bad that you won&#39;t be able to see the Tapestry of Nations parade, it was truly spectacular.<br /><br />We took a day for MGM and Animal Kingdom.&nbsp; But with all of the additions to Animal Kingdom, it may need more time.&nbsp; The safari was cool.&nbsp; My cousin is one of the head chefs at the Animal Kingdom Lodge restaurant.<br /><br />Thanks for the detailed postings everyone!&nbsp; It really brought back a lot of memories!&nbsp; I wanna go back real soon!

				If you do find yourself in &quot;Downtown Disney,&quot; the New England clam chowder at Cap&#39;n something-something&#39;s Grog Hut is delicious.&nbsp; Don&#39;t go there for a meal, though, because that&#39;s the only thing that&#39;s good.&nbsp; It&#39;s nice for a late-night snack, though.

				Okay.. I have to chime in on this.. First of all, my uncle used to work there so we used to get the park hopper passes. You want to beat the crowds etc.. FAKE ANKLE INJURY. Get a wheelchair and it&#039;s a front row ticket every time. I know it&#039;s shady but when you&#039;ll always have a seat and you can get pushed around. My only other tip is the 1000 calorie turkey drumstick. Get it.. IT&#039;s delish! :mrgreen:

				<em>So has anyone used The Magical Express, where Disney transports you and your luggage to the hotel?&nbsp; Does your luggage really arrive 3 hours after you do, or do they just have to say that, just in case?</em><br /><br />We used them and it was heaven. I wouldn&#039;t go any other way now. We just went down to the counter after we arrived at Orlando Int., got on a bus and never had to lay a finger on any luggage. Of course I was a bit worried the luggage would be lost (I&#039;m a worrier), but it arrived at our room about 45 minutes after we checked in. I think the 3 hour thing is just a disclaimer. Just carry on anything that you&#039;ll <em>really </em>need and you&#039;ll have no problems. On the way back, it was the same. Just gave our luggage to the front desk and didn&#039;t see it until back at LaGuardia. <br /><br />Have a great time and please tell us all about the trip when you get back!! :mrgreen:<br />

				<em>Yea, I know.&nbsp; I am not a disney fan -- and I like my days to be magic-free.<br />I think I might be the lone disney dissenter in this thread.<br /><br />Spending time with family though is awesome -- as is going on a vacation you&#039;ve always wanted to go on.&nbsp; So are rollercoasters!</em><br /><br />Not only am I a Disney Dissenter (tm), I can&#039;t bear hanging out with my own family (three hours tops per occasion.)<br /><br />My father took us to Disneyworld for the first time when I was 14- a surly 14. In all the photos, I have this look on my face like, &quot;SO not cool!&quot; But of course there were things even I liked- EPCOT Center, Space Mtn, Mr. Toad&#039;s Wild Ride, the prancing water fountain, etc. etc.<br /><br />That &quot;small world&quot; ride, whatever it&#039;s called, can die a slow painful death for the music alone for all I care.<br /><br />A Disney friend of mine invited me on a Disney cruise with her family one year, and all I could think was, how wrong on so many levels! The idea of a cruise never appealed to me; being locked on board with Disney characters; surrounded by married guys and hyper kids....<br /><br />&nbsp;:killme: :yuck:

				Disneyworld was so much fun!!&nbsp; Exhausting, but fun.&nbsp; We arrived on Sunday in Orlando.&nbsp; The Disney Magical Express picked us up from the airport and brought us to the All Star Music Resort.&nbsp; Along the way, we were fed a promotional video of Disney featuring all the characters on their way to Disneyworld, and all the magical things you can do there.&nbsp; We were given a room facing the parking lot at first, but we asked for a room facing the gigantic guitar shaped pool instead, and they gave it to us!!&nbsp; The resort is really nice, and they have 2 pools, the other is a piano shaped one.&nbsp; They have an onsite cafeteria, which will slowly make you think of your school cafeteria, only with outrageous prices and less choices.&nbsp; It is loud and even looks like a school.&nbsp; But at least you can get food, because Disney has nothing in the way of a drugstore or grocery in their big city.&nbsp; You need to get a car and go outside Disney for that.&nbsp; It was at the Music Resort that we first discovered that something is terribly wrong with Orlando water.&nbsp; It&#039;s tastes and smells really bad.&nbsp; Even the fountain drinks are mixed with it and cannot mask the taste.&nbsp; The shower and bathroom stunk from the nasty water.&nbsp; Very strange.&nbsp; As if they wanted you to purchase the bottled stuff.&nbsp; Made me miss our NYC tap water, which is so much better.&nbsp; The room was nice though and comfortable.&nbsp; Yeah, it&#039;s the value one but it&#039;s decent, and you are entitled to use any of the pools or other amenities at other Disney resorts as long as you stay at one.<br /><br />There are buses that pick you up right outside your resort every 10-15minutes and take you to the parks.&nbsp; Epkot was probably my favorite park.&nbsp; Soarin is a great ride which simulates flying over California&#039;s Golden Gate bridge, mountains, etc, it was really fun!&nbsp; A lot of the rides at Epkot are actually films but they are fun nonetheless and we enjoyed them.&nbsp; The lines weren&#039;t bad at all there, but that Fast Pass definitely came in handy. The thing is you have to get the Pass early, because they do run out of them, and you have to wait in the line after that.&nbsp; The park was so big, we couldn&#039;t do it all, and we were so exhausted by midday even.&nbsp; The fireworks are awesome!!&nbsp; So pretty.&nbsp; We visited most of the countries, the Mexico ride is being redone, but Norway&#039;s boat ride was fun!&nbsp; They should have more finger food samples at the countries, instead of full dinners. Would allow you to sample more.&nbsp; We had dinner at The Italian Pavilion - La Roma.&nbsp; Excellent food, great service.&nbsp; Not all the food sucks, I guess if you&#039;re willing to pay for it.&nbsp; It was our one big splurge and it was worth it.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s the year of a million dreams in Disney, and cast members randomly hand out dreams to people in the park.&nbsp; It could be a fast pass all day, a night at the Cinderella castle, a chance to be a host at a ride for a day- uniform and all.&nbsp; We actually got a dream!!&nbsp; We were so excited!&nbsp; They selected 8 people or so to go ahead of the line in Soarin, and in the waiting room granted us our dream. You don&#039;t get to pick it though, we got collectible Disney pins that are apparently valuable (right), but it was very cool either way!<br /><br />Magical Kingdom was alot busier, but we planned it well, because we took off on the train straight to Frontierland, where Splash Mountain is and Big Thunder Railroad Mountain.&nbsp; We went on Splash Mtn twice, the second time convincing my mom to brave the 50ft drop.&nbsp; Definitely in my top fave rides.&nbsp; Hardly any wait in the mornings for these rides.&nbsp; We went to go to Pirates, waited 20 minutes and the ride broke!! The audio went out, and they actually made everyone leave!&nbsp; They gave everyone Fast Passes for any ride to come back.&nbsp; So we came back later in the day and watched Jack Sparrow in a show, my bro got to be an honorary pirate!&nbsp; Then we went on the ride.&nbsp; They have incorporated Jack into it.&nbsp; It was pretty cool.&nbsp; Small World is a trippy experience but beautiful.&nbsp; Had to skip some things, like the Haunted Mansion and Peter Pan.&nbsp; Also such a big park, you can&#039;t do it all in a day.&nbsp; They all are.&nbsp; Rode Space Mountain twice. Awesome!&nbsp; Monsters comedy show is funny, Buzz Lightyear shoot em up alien ride is hilarious, Stitch show is smelly fun, Nemo is cool.&nbsp; Crush show is totally tubular man!!&nbsp; Like totally!! Fireworks beautiful!&nbsp; They have a light show parade that is great, before that.&nbsp; It&#039;s strange though, they have that at 7pm, and the fireworks at 8pm, so you have to wait a half hour and do nothing before the fireworks.&nbsp; We couldn&#039;t find a seat anywhere, and had to sit on the concrete.&nbsp; Not particularly comfortable.&nbsp; They shouldn&#039;t make people wait like that.&nbsp; Everyone is exhausted, it&#039;s a 12 hour day!<br /><br />Animal Kingdom got the shaft.&nbsp; We were so exhausted we couldn&#039;t finish it all.&nbsp; It definitely cannot be done in a matter of hours. It&#039;s huge!&nbsp; We went straight to Dinoland, and rode Dinosaur.&nbsp; Loved it!&nbsp; You are put on a jeep in the dark, on a jungle ride to find the escaped t-rex.&nbsp; This ride is so scary!&nbsp; &nbsp;My family had such classic faces, I just had to buy the pics that they take at that crucial moment.&nbsp; We could be on a poster for this ride.&nbsp; It&#039;s hilarious!&nbsp; Mount Everest roller coaster is pretty scary too.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Safari ride is about the most waste of your time.&nbsp; They ran out of fast pass, so you do wait the hour, and then you see hardly any animals!!&nbsp; The driver goes so fast anytime you see an animal, you have no time for a picture, or even to study or get a good look at them.&nbsp; Sometimes you don&#039;t even see the animals, they are hiding or sleeping atop some hill like the lion was.&nbsp; It was such a waste of time.&nbsp; You could have a better time going to the Bronx Zoo.&nbsp; We were so exhausted we left shortly thereafter.&nbsp; The gorillas on the trail walk are the most exciting - you actually see them, the tigers - they were hiding.&nbsp; Couldn&#039;t find them.<br /><br />Cirque De Soleil is the most amazing show you&#039;ll ever see.&nbsp; It&#039;s a permanent show at Disney, called La Nouba.&nbsp; We loved it!&nbsp; I&#039;ve never seen anything like it!&nbsp; Downtown Disney is fun, didn&#039;t really go out clubbing.&nbsp; Planet Hollywood is cool.&nbsp; One piece of advice, make reservations.&nbsp; Our first night we had none, and Rainforest Cafe had a 2 1/2 hr wait - that is unless you are rich people and bought into their members club.&nbsp; Then you would get seating fast.&nbsp; What a way to bribe the restaurant.&nbsp; They won&#039;t seat you unless you give them money.&nbsp; Nice.&nbsp; All the restaurants had awful waits, we ended up at Wolfgang Puck Express that night, which wasn&#039;t great and still had a wait.&nbsp; Thankfully, the rest of the trip went wonderfully because we had reservations everywhere.<br /><br />Seaworld was fun too!&nbsp; Lots of animal exhibits and awesome water animal shows.&nbsp; Couple rides, they were fun too.&nbsp; Still bad tasting water.&nbsp; What&#039;s up with that?&nbsp; We ate the Disney Boardwalk that night, was very pretty.<br /><br />The last day we checked out, the airline takes your bags to the airport for you from Disney, which is really convenient.&nbsp; We lounged by the pool all day before our flight.&nbsp; It was great to finally relax in the sun.&nbsp; We needed it.&nbsp; All in all, a great trip.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to go back one day and do MGM and Universal.&nbsp; I can&#039;t say I&#039;d go back and do Disney every year.&nbsp; It&#039;s not exactly a relaxing vacation, but I did have a great time.&nbsp; It was magical.&nbsp; We got a dream!&nbsp; I have over 400 pics and a huge Disney vacation scrapbook website to create.&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp; &nbsp;:lol:<br />

				Awww...your post makes me want to go back again! Glad you had a good time!<br /><br />I&#039;m very happy to hear that the Mexico ride is being redone. It was the same exact ride, right down to the cheesy videos and rickety animatronics, that was there when I first went to Epcot in 1984! It was soooo dated you couldn&#039;t help but cringe &amp; laugh.<br /><br />I think the PotC ride must break down every single day. Amazing.<br /><br />Oh, one last thing...hold on to that collectible pin because in a couple years, if you don&#039;t want it, you could probably ebay it for some good $$. Disney Pin Traders are a rabid bunch.&nbsp; :evil:

				If there was gonna be *one more* bitter cold, dark day, I&#039;d probably be down there now!<br /><br />Thanks for the write-up, I like the sound of those Fast Passes. It&#039;s been a VERY long time so I should probably give it a chance again sometime.
