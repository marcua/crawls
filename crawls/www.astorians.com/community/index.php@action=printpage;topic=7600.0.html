From previous experience, if you post materials on the internet that it does not require a pass word to view or is not sent individually to people, you cannot sell someone first publication rights, which is what magazines and such want. <br /><br />It&#039;s a shame, but it makes sense. Magazines don&#039;t want to pay you for what everyone&#039;s already seen for free. That&#039;s why the editing forums I used to belong to were members only, so that you could still sell the work you had edited there.

				I think Wednesday early evening (like 6/6:30) is best for ME and potentially others as it breaks up the week and its early enough that your workday momentum hasnt burned out yet. I would think Freeze Peach or the Waltz would be good places to consider, or maybe Sparrow.

I could always be late, tho! And I support all the options mentioned in theory, but I think Sparrow might be too loud if we wanted to read our works aloud. Maybe Stini Yamis might be worth considering.

				Waltz hosts a poetry reading night the first Monday of every month (at least I think they still do it - haven&#039;t been in a while).&nbsp; It&#039;s open to anyone, like an open mic night specifically for poetry and the occasional short story.&nbsp; &nbsp;Their website should have the information of the woman who organizes it.

				I&#039;ve been to Waltz&#039;s poetry night and wasn&#039;t really impressed by the vibe. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s the right place for a reading or at least, it didn&#039;t seem so to me.

				When I first moved to the area and found out about the poetry readings at Waltz, I shook up some nerve, grabbed a stack of poems and ran in there...and there was NO BODY there. Not even an organizer so I dunno. If they are reading this, perhaps there should be a little more advertising about the event- people have short memories.

				Huh, my bad.&nbsp; I just checked their website and they have no mention of the readings anymore.&nbsp; Guess they stopped doing it.&nbsp; The couple times I went, attendance was pretty low - maybe that&#039;s why.&nbsp;
