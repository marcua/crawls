				I&#039;m a huge Quentin Tarantino fan, and yesterday I eagerly plunked down my hard earned dollars to buy a DVD copy of &quot;Death Proof,&quot; one half of the double feature released as &quot;Grindhouse&quot; a few months back.&nbsp; Unfortunately, they made the decision to release the two films from the double feature, &quot;Death Proof&quot; and Robert Rodriguez&#039;s &quot;Planet Terror&quot; separately.&nbsp; This was a huge disappointment to me, because the two films together were part of an experience mimicking the grindhouse double features of old, complete with phony movie trailers and advertisements.&nbsp; I think I am one of maybe ten people in America who saw Grindhouse in the theatre, and enjoyed it.&nbsp; None of this content carried over to the &quot;Death Proof&quot; DVD, and from what I hear, it won&#039;t be included on &quot;Planet Terror&quot; either.&nbsp; I assume that they will eventually release a boxed set with all of the theatrical content included, but I bought my copy of &quot;Death Proof&quot; yesterday anyhow.&nbsp; Mainly because they have been saying for a long time that a special edition of &quot;Kill Bill&quot; will eventually come out.&nbsp; It has yet to materialize.&nbsp; If they do come out with a Grindhouse box set, I will likely buy a copy anyhow, as I am stupid like that.&nbsp; I watched the DVD version of Death Proof last night, and I think it&#039;s awful.&nbsp; It is an extended version, which restores some scenes that were deleted in the theatrical cut.&nbsp; And I really can see why these scenes were cut.&nbsp; Their inclusion totally destroys the flow of the movie.&nbsp; And guess what?&nbsp; There is no option to watch the theatrical version, as some DVDs kindly include.&nbsp; I was really disappointed by this DVD offering.&nbsp; Die hard Quentin fans will still enjoy it, but for those who hated the long dialogue scenes of the original, expect much more of the same.&nbsp; Any other Astorians out there who have thoughts on Grindhouse or other Tarantino films?

				<br /><br />im a big Tarentino fan, Kill Bill 1 and 2 is my favorite, i didnt get a chance to see grind house as much as i wanted to, but im disapointed to hear they split the grindhouse into 2 dvd&#039;s, i bet it comes down to money, <br /><br />so Death Proof was bad ? with such a cool story line, i didnt think they will f it up that bad<br /><br />should i even spend my money on renting it ?<br />[/quote]

				If you really enjoyed it in the theatres, you should probably buy it.&nbsp; I mean, it still has the amazing 18 minute car chase...

				Um, I think I read somewhere that it would drop in November.&nbsp; My hope is that they release a box set which will restore the theatrical version of Grindhouse.

				I hope they include all the trailers.&nbsp; Preferably with the extended Thanksgiving turkey f&#039;ing scene; I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve even been so shocked and amused at the same time.

				Scenes are almost always deleted for good reason from movies.&nbsp; I remember when the extended Apocalypse Now Redux came out with the fabled French Plantation scene people always talked about included in the movie.&nbsp; And guess what, that scene totally dragged the movie right when you&#039;re finally about to get to Kurtz&#039;s compound.&nbsp; Turned out most people preferred it without.<br /><br />I also saw Grindhouse in the theater.&nbsp; Deathproof was definitely more enjoyable than Planet Terror but I thought they were both too long.&nbsp; I know the point was to replicate the old double feature Corman-esque B-movies, but those movies were a complete story, whereas Planet Terror and to a lesser extent Deathproof were intentionally choppy.&nbsp; I mean in Planet Terror they skip from being holed up in the bar to the bar totally on fire.&nbsp; I get the missing scene was supposed to be a joke/style choice, but I&#039;m more of a story over style kinda of viewer.&nbsp; Deathproof was better, and Kurt Russell was great &quot;Careful my arm!&nbsp; I think its broken! Ahhhh (screams like a woman)&quot;, but there was too much build up with that first group of girls. We were all drunk and other things (cough cough) when we saw it, which I would say is part of the b-movie experience, and my one friend fell asleep.<br /><br />It does suck when DVDs won&#039;t let you watch the theatrical version, and not including the trailers (Don&#039;t Don&#039;t DON&#039;T was my favorite) is bullshit since they were supposed to be a big part of the &quot;experience&quot;
