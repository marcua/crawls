				Just curious what ISP most of you use, and what the average broadband connection will cost you here. I&#39;d prefer cable to DSL, but I don&#39;t know what the price difference is or anything.<br /><br />Up until this point, I&#39;ve lived in the boonies where no broadband connection was to be had for love or money. I&#39;m not even sure where to start looking for prices &amp; information.<br /><br />Pointers? :D<br /><br />- B.

				We just use TWC&#39;s RoadRunner.&nbsp; $44.95 a Month.&nbsp; With 5 people to divide the bills, it&#39;s pretty cheap for us, and usually very reliable.

				I&#39;ve had dial-up through Earthlink for ages, but just upgraded to their high-speed cable. They get the cable service through your cable provider-- in my case Time Warner (but I got to keep my existing earthlink e-mail address, a plus for me)<br /><br />It was a super easy set-up. Since I was already a Time Warner customer, all they had to do was come to my apartment, split the cable line and run it into the room where my computer is. Plugged it into a router, into my computer and like magic I was online immediately. I&#39;d say the technician was there for 20 minutes, tops.<br /><br />Earthlink has a promotion for new cable customers-- $29.99 a month for the first 6 months ($41.95/month thereafter) It just gets tacked onto your cable bill.<br /><br />So far I&#39;m thrilled with the service-- it&#39;s super fast &nbsp; :-)<br /><br />If you&#39;re starting from scratch, you could check out the service offered from Time Warner directly (Road Runner I think). They probably have a comparable offer price-wise. I only went thru Earthlink because I wanted to keep the e-mail address I&#39;ve had for years.<br /><br />hope that helps!

				Basically the TimeWarner&#39;s website lists Earthlink and Road Runner as part of their offerings.&nbsp; When looking at the difference between, I really do not see any, except for the e-mail address.&nbsp; So, it&#39;s up to you whether you want their e-mail addys or not.&nbsp; As far as their advertised prices, they are the same with maybe some of the promotion type stuff that artgirl mentioned :-).

				an alternative to TWC (earthlink/roadrunner) is RCN.&nbsp; Its more expensive, but in my opinion, slightly better if TWC has done a shoddy installation job in your building.

				I use Yahoo, but that&#39;s because I started with Prodigy, and SBC Yahoo swallowed up Prodigy, and AT&amp;T swallowed up SBC Yahoo and renamed it AT&amp;T Yahoo.&nbsp; (They let former Prodigy subscribers keep their Prodigy addresses and even open new Prodigy accounts.)&nbsp; I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re offering new accounts in the NYC area, but the old ones are grandfathered in.&nbsp; I had dial-up on my old computer and I plan to upgrade it to DSL on my new computer.

				The only difference between Earthlink Broadband and Time Warner Roadrunner is if you want channel service.&nbsp; If you don&#39;t, go thru Earthlink and they&#39;ll set you up with Time Warner, and you don&#39;t have to order channel service.&nbsp; You can get a few channels by splitting the cable into your tv.&nbsp; It&#39;s not a lot of channels, but it&#39;s basic and good enough for some people.&nbsp; Go thru Time Warner, and you will have to order a channel service package.&nbsp; &nbsp;So it depends on how much money you want to spend.<br /><br />

				I used to run a computer repair shop, and I spent more time cleaning up farked up Earthlink installations than I care to discuss. I hate that company. But I don&#39;t need cable TV, so I guess that&#39;s my only choice, huh?

				I get DSL through Verizon for about $35 a month. It&#39;s okay. <br /><br />I&#39;m drooling over FIOS, but I&#39;ve read that Verizon is pressuring people to let them rip out the copper in their homes and replace it with fiber, thus giving Verizon a stranglehold on your phone and internet service.
