				Need a small private room at restaurant for 15 guests that won't mind a few small kids. Any recs? I've been searching and it doesn't seem like the restaurants in Astoria have private rooms. Am I wrong?

				&quot;Lil' Bistro 33&quot; might prove a good option. Here's a link to their website:<br />http://www.lilbistro33.com/<br />They don't have a private party room, but they're so small that if you make a reservation for your party of fifteen, you'll have the place practically to yourselves.<br /><br />&quot;Arharn Thai&quot; has a special table for banquets and could easily accommodate a group of fifteen or so. It's not a private room, but I have been going there often for a long time and there always seems to be a large banquet going on. So I guess they really have their banquet deal down! And they're very child-friendly. Info link:<br />http://dinesite.com/info/rstrnt-58996/<br /><br />&quot;Gallini Seafood Restaurant&quot; has a smaller room off the large main room. <br />I couldn't find a link for them, but they're on the corner of 34th Street and 36th Avenue. You should be able to get their phone number in the Yellow Pages.<br /><br />I've been to the above three restaurants multiple times and can say the food at all of them is excellent, and the prices most reasonable considering the high quality.
