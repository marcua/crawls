				When flipping the channels last night, I came across a very disturbing show (yes, more disturbing than seeing the acne-faced bloated Eric Cartman pooping into a plastic dish while playing World of Warcraft).&nbsp; This show aired on QPTV (channel 56) from 9:30 to 10:00 pm last night.&nbsp; It is called &quot;Judaism.&quot;&nbsp; I think I have seen bits of this before, with different hosts.&nbsp; This one was hosted by a person called &quot;Rabbi M. Friedman.&quot;<br /><br />If you didn&#39;t catch this particular show, you&#39;re a better person for it.&nbsp; But I did, and I became really incensed and embarrassed.&nbsp; The views expressed in the show were racist and hateful.&nbsp; Obviously, as somebody who pays attention to things Jewish, I know that out there on the fringe there are some extreme and hostile people (as there are with all religious and ethnic groups).&nbsp; But in the case of this show, the hateful views were masquerading simply as &quot;Judaism.&quot;&nbsp; I find that totally obscene.&nbsp; To think that some unsuspecting person out there might see that show, and then perhaps mistake the racism and hate for mainstream Jewish values- that scares me tremendously.&nbsp; I can only hope that most people are sohpisticated enough to recognize extremism when they see it.<br /><br />This isn&#39;t the place to discuss what Judaism is or is not- but I am really pissed off that a show called &quot;Judaism&quot; serves as a forum for hate-mongering.&nbsp; This is the price of free speech, I guess.&nbsp;

				They did an article on his show and the complaints it is engendering in the Daily News (or maybe the NY Post) this week.&nbsp; It sounds quite terrible and offensive.

				I googled Rabbi M. Friedman QPTV and came up with the following... <br />http://keywords.oxus.net/archives/2005/10/01/community-access-tv/<br />http://www.fpp.co.uk/HNet/Liebermann240800.html<br /><br />Apparently he&#39;s a big fan of pulsa dinura (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsa_denura) ceremonies with those who disagree with his world view, which is shameful to say the least.<br /><br />(oh and for the record, his full name is Rabbi Mordechai Friedman, since M. Friedman is common and you&#39;d come up just as easily with Rabbi Michael Friedman, a prominent Rabbi in the Reform Movement and in no way related to this Rabbi in question except as &quot;an enemy&quot;)<br />

Friedman&quot;&#39;s rants may be (and actually, what I saw on TV was worse than anything in these articles), it may not make much sense to gather information about one extremist from the web page of another extremist.<br /><br />but at any rate, now you see my point about the show.<br />bennyt<br />
