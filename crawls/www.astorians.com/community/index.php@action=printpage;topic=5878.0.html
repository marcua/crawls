				Just got to thinking on a smoke break today what fun it would be to strap on a battery-amp and ride the rails playing some tunes. The more I thought about it, the more excited I got- especially after seeing Dick Dale&#039;s advice to Indie Artists (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJNnLIPZ_n4). <br /><br />So, does anyone know anything about doing this? I called 311 to get information on obtaining a permit, but they were unable to help me until the MUNY office opened on Monday- I then looked up MUNY, and it&#039;s not exactly what I&#039;m looking for, especially since their once-a-year audition day has come and gone. <br /><br />I guess I&#039;d like to know (if you know):<br /><br />a) do you need a permit?<br />a2) if yes, how do I get one?<br />a3) if no, then I&#039;m going out there tomorrow!<br /><br />b) if no, because it&#039;s a crime:<br />b2) what if you&#039;re not asking for money?<br /><br />I really want to get out there, subway stops, trains, even street corners. Anyone have experience with this?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Preston

				that was a great interview.&#160; and his advice applies to so many things, not just music. i&#039;m working on a book concept and have been advised to &quot;self publish&quot;.&#160;&nbsp; as for your questoin, i think with subway stations one needs to go thru the mta somehow. over the course of a month i notice various musician&#039;s performing at the same station and they all seem to perform behind the same stairwell/location.

				I&#039;ve debated busking in NY but often wondered what the permit entailed. I did it in San Francisco and London. If you&#039;re busking in stations you have to go through the MTA/transportation service and if you&#039;re doing it in the street you have to go through city &amp; county. That seems to be the basic rule no matter where you go. In London you need a permit and I noticed that a lot of NY is modeled after London so its no surprise to me that you&#039;d have to wait forever to get an audition. I&#039;m still waiting for my London audition after 3 months.

				If you&#039;re fast on your feet and travel light you can busk just about anywhere with more than one exit.<br /><br />Its like taxes, you can deduct anything as long as you don&#039;t get audited.

				If you&#039;re going to busk in the morning or late at night, please play nice music and not some kind of loud, distorted, thumping noise.&nbsp; Have some courtesy.

				Thanks for the replies my friends. It seems it may be a little while before I&#039;m a troubadour- it&#039;s a nice one for the back-burner, though. And re: goldfish boy&#039;s post... of course I would never aurally assault anyone, I&#039;m looking to build a fan base, not alienate anyone.:)

				remember the guy--I think in the late 80s, early 90s, on the 1/9--who played his saxaphone badly and asked for money to stop? <br /><br />or is he still out there?
