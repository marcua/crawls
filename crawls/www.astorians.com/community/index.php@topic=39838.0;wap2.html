			This thread has been read 145 times as of my writing this, not including the reading I&#039;m doing now. Are there NO good handymen in Astoria? Really?<br /><br />What do Astorians do when something needs repairs?

			Believe me, I wonder the same question about repairs.&nbsp; I have a shopping cart with a broken rear axle.&nbsp; I can find replacement wheels online, which I don&#039;t need, but nothing in regard to axles, and the one time I attempted to ask at Home Adviser I got an instant estimate of $150 minimum because nobody has heard of repairing shopping cart axles and the site thinks I&#039;m talking about car axles.&nbsp; The cart cost about $20 20 years ago.&nbsp; It&#039;s now 99% cart, 1% broken, and 100% useless and I finally gave in and mail ordered a new cart.&nbsp; You might have to use a site like Home Adviser, though.<br /><br /><br /><br />

			This is a window in my apartment I need repaired. I can&#039;t buy another window and I&#039;m not about to move out.

			https://www.homeadvisor.com/<br /><br /><br />Home Advisor is for finding home repair/ home care people.&nbsp; They&#039;re not real estate agents, and home means &quot;home&quot;, not just &quot;house&quot;.&nbsp; It&#039;s like Angie&#039;s List.&nbsp; I&#039;m not recommending any services because I haven&#039;t actually used them, I&#039;m just saying if nobody on Astorians knows of anyone to recommend to you, you might try looking for someone on a professional listing site.&nbsp;
