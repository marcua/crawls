				<br />There was a live music show on August 4 with Motor City Revue.&nbsp; They were awesome!<br /><br />Just wondering...was there anyone else like me who was up front and had a good view of the area right in front of the stage?&nbsp; Was anyone else thinking....er .....&#039;jail bait&#039;....seeing that young girl and the way she was dancing?&nbsp; Not that her dancing was necessarily totally inappropriate, but all I could think was &#039;don&#039;t her parents realize there are lots of pervs out there?....they don&#039;t see a problem with her dancing that way?&#039;&nbsp; It was really quite remarkable.&nbsp; lol<br /><br />

				<br />Yes, that must be the same girl.&nbsp; At the Motor City Revue concert, what was funny was that towards the end&nbsp; of the show, a number of &#039;normal&#039; dancers started to gather on one side of the stage and just dance on their own, while then on the other side was that girl who popped up again and started up her performance again.&nbsp; I wonder where her parents were in all this... she was dancing in such a way that at first I thought maybe she was a hired dancer...that&#039;s how much her dancing came off more as &#039;performing&#039;.&nbsp; lol
