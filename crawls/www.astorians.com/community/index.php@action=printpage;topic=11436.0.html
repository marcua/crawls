				Hey I know there were threads on this before but they were very old so I started a new topic.<br /><br />I am looking for either a bar or restaurant that holds Texas Hold Em Tournaments (Winners get bar tabs or prizes, thats fine, doesnt have to be for cash), or simply anyone who holds open cash games at an apartment or house. I am not a pro level player or rich by any means, so I am mostly looking for 25 dollar buy ins and under, but just curious as to what type of poker is around here since I am fairly new to the area and love to play. Thanks guys.<br /><br />-Andrew

				I&#039;m putting together a small friendly home poker/cigar/beer night, most likely on Thursday nights. <br /><br />It&#039;ll be tournament style (you buy-in for a set $ amount and receive 1500 to 2500 in chips). <br /><br />It&#039;s going to start as pretty low buy-ins ($10) as several of the players have never even played poker before. The first time we play it will definitely be slow with a lot of explaining going on. So we&#039;re looking for more laid back/inexperienced players. <br /><br />Anyone who&#039;s interested can PM me your email address. <br /><br />Space is limited so I make no promises. <br /><br />Warning: Any women who smoke cigars, drink and play poker should be warned there will probably be multiple marriage proposals.
