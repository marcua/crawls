				<br />http://ny.metro.us/metro/local/article/Slap_F_in_windows_of_filthy_restaurants/13669.html<br /><br />This is a little fun read, which includes &#039;chalupa&#039;.<br />&nbsp;:-P<br /><br />http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=6390898<br /><br />There are some other fun stories, and abclocal has links to best and worst reports.<br />Makes me glad to not be in Brooklyn. Some of these places have over 90 violation points.<br />&nbsp;:lol:&nbsp; &nbsp;:evil:&nbsp; &nbsp;:-o<br /><br /><br /><br />One Queens thai made the best list this year.

				uuuuhhhhh..... I am thrilled that I have not eaten at any of the listed nastiest restaurants of the year.&nbsp; Over a hundred violation points? That doesn&#039;t happen over night. How does it get that bad without having to close?

				McDonald&#039;s certainly, and Blimpy&#039;s too I guess, don&#039;t do much food preparation in their restaurants. Mostly they are heating and assembling food that was trimmed, portioned, shaped, mixed, etc. at some commissary and packaged for transport and storage. They have lots fewer ways to screw up, and less kitchen garbage to attract and maintain vermin.<br /><br />And fast-food chains each have a &quot;system&quot; of standard procedures - a competently run store is probably at low risk of a significant violation by its design.
