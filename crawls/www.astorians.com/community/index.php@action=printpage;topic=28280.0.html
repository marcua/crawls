				I couldn&#039;t find a recent discussion of this topic here, so I thought I should post something about it. While the shelter isn&#039;t in Astoria proper, it is very close by and will certainly affect Astoria. BTW, I&#039;m not looking to debate the issue...just want to share the info.<br /><br />http://astoriapost.com/2014/07/24/residents-want-homeless-shelter-gone-expressed-concerns-about-crime-and-schools/

				I&#039;m baffled. If this place was NOT a homeless shelter, it is then a place for hourly stays for adultery and prostitution. But people have a problem with homeless people having a place to live instead? Seems backwards to me.

				One of the differences may be that the prostitutes weren&#039;t long-term residents sending their kids to already crowded schools. Not that the homeless residents are the same as prostitutes....just following the previous comparison.

				They don&#039;t say Westway is the best way for nuthin&#039;.<br /><br /><br />This is a very, very on-going situation. This motel has been used as a temporary homeless shelter on and off for many years and before that it used to as a temporary shelter for people awaiting deportation.<br /><br /><br />Why it&#039;s become so contentious now is that the city has been opening &#039;permanent&#039; homeless shelters throughout the city without consulting the community or local elected officials. Another shelter was established at the Pan Am hotel on Queens Blvd in Elmhurst, though the city said this would not happen.<br /><br /><br />In 2012 residents were able to stop the shelter from becoming permanent, though it is my understanding that the Westway stilled housed some homeless residents on a temporary overnight basis since. <br /><br /><br />It&#039;s mostly NIMBYism but also, I think the main objection is that the city warehouses homeless families with complex needs and offers little to no support and it&#039;s the local residents who have to deal with any problems that arise. Supposedly the Westway shelter will be run by an organization called Women in Need, so maybe it won&#039;t be the case in this instance.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />

				I realize this is a very complicated issue, but I can&#039;t be against mothers and young children having a roof over their head at night.&nbsp; I hope as a community we can find a way to make this work and support them, so that this is a transition to something better.<br />&nbsp;<br />Surely it&#039;s in everyone&#039;s best interest if this shelter is able to provide a stable, supportive environment for the young children rather than having them out on the street.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Unfortunately, these families, many of whom have ended up in the shelter after being displaced due to tragic circumstances (like fire, or domestic violence) have found themselves unwelcome in the neighborhood and targeted by police. The majority of these families are minorities -- African-American, or Hispanic -- and are typically targets of police, but in a neighborhood that is predominately white, these families are easy to identify in the community and are unfairly being harassed by police. It seems like they&#039;re just looking for statistics to say &quot;look, the shelter has brought with it an uptick in crime&quot; so they can argue that it should be closed. <br /><br /><br />People agree with providing help for women, children, and families in need until it becomes a NIMBY situation.

				Pejorative terms such as NIMBY and racist are often used to dismiss the legitimate concerns of local residents. It is most likely that those who seek to delegitimize these concerns do not live close to the shelter. Local residents who live within a 5 block radius of the shelter will tell you that since the shelter has opened their cars have been broken into repeatedly. <span style="font-family: Verdana;" class="bbc_font">They will tell you about being confronted by aggressive panhandlers.</span> They will also tell you that they witness public urination and defecation regularly. They will also tell you that they have found used heroin needles and empty heroin packets in their backyards and on the sidewalks in front of their homes. They will tell you that they are afraid that their young children will pick up used needles or accidentally step on them. They will also tell you of being threatened with unprovoked violence while riding a city bus home with their children. <br /><br /><br />When you speak to local residents (even in private), they will NOT tell you that they are afraid of seeing a black or Hispanic man on their block, or whatever stereotypical fear others want to impose on them. Whether you speak to Greek, Italian, Dominican, Ecuadorian, Filipino, Colombian, Irish, Guyanese, Albanian, Indian, Moroccan, Egyptian, or Chinese residents; they will all recount the same types of incidents and how they are often afraid for theirs and their family&#039;s safety. Shelter residents are not being assaulted or verbally threatened by local residents. There have been no angry protests at the shelter. The shelter residents have not been denied any rights in this neighborhood. <br /><br /><br />The homeless residents are not being targeted by police. There is NOT an increased police presence in the area. The representatives of the 114 frequently deny that these things are happening at all, or that they could have anything to do with the shelter opening. This is very frustrating to local residents who have been victims of crime.<br /><br /><br />To deny that shelters can be homes to criminals, drug-addicts, and the mentally ill; as well as hard-working families needing temporatry help, is naive. These are the types of issues that residents want to see addressed. Here is a sampling of shelter issues in NYC.<br />http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20141006/chelsea/peace-officers-sent-into-homeless-shelter-that-neighbors-call-war-zone/slideshow/558210#slideshow-carousel<br />http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Stepdaughter-Beating-Death-Brooklyn-Homeless-Shelter-Brother-New-York-City--279800982.html<br />http://gothamist.com/2014/10/25/mother_charged_with_murder_of_4-yea.php<br />http://www.westsiderag.com/2014/06/19/amid-protest-bratton-ends-raids-on-upper-west-side-homeless-shelters<br /><br /><br />Also, just to set the record straight....the Westway is not a DV (domestic violence) shelter or &#039;women with children only&#039; shelter. It is a family residence with men, women, and children (from infants to age 17). It is also not a Queens-specific shelter. All NYC shelters are open to anyone who presents at the intake office as homeless regardless of their NYS residency or citizenship status. Also, outstanding warrant checks are not performed prior to shelter placement.

				NIMBY isn&#039;t a race, so I stopped reading. <br /><br /><br />If you are referring to me castigating an entire group, it&#039;s not like people are born NIMBYs, don&#039;t have a choice to be one and I am unfairly discriminating against them.

				Ok I&#039;ll throw another log on this fire...<br /><br />So far as I know there is no NYC/NYS residency requirement for homeless entering the system. I&#039;ve read quite a few stories that state some of the homeless in these shelters lived in other states, then showed up in NYC and entered our shelter system. <br /><br />NYC on a whole is an extremely expensive city to live in. I&#039;m curious how many people in shelters are able to get out of the shelter system, and if some are not better off living in different parts of the country were cost of living is far less. (Hell, I know people with great jobs planning to escape NYC due to cost of living...).<br /><br /><br />

				Both this conversation, and the other thread about homeless people, I have been watching closely. I was curious about how many people looked at the homeless situation as a problem that is an annoyance to our quality of life, and how many view is as a problem that is one we need to solve to help our fellow citizens. Sadly, it&#039;s imbalanced in the wrong direction. <br /><br /><br />If someone&#039;s homeless, let&#039;s give them a home, and if there are other issues beyond it that can be corrected in those individuals&#039; lives, then let&#039;s do that. Let&#039;s not sit and let people be outside on the street during winter.

				Regarding the discussion of the term NIMBY. I was saying that it is a derogatory term used to dismiss legitimate concerns. I did not say it was a race of people. <br /><br /><br />Regarding the homeless coming here from other states or countries, this is certainly an issue. I couldn&#039;t find any current statistics on this, but here are a few articles from the past 5 years discussing it.<br />http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/out-of-town-homeless-families-flooding-new-york-city-shelters-article-1.1125381<br />http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/18/nyregion/new-york-as-safety-net-for-out-of-town-homeless.html<br />http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/29/nyregion/29oneway.html<br /><br /><br />No one I know (including myself) is saying that these people or others like them should be left to sleep outside in the cold. Thanks to hard-working tax-payers, the city has plenty of money to open emergency homeless shelters wherever they see fit. The main issue here is whether these folks are receiving the proper social services to help with their drug addictions and/or mental disorders. Another issue is whether local law enforcement is taking appropriate action regarding crimes being committed by shelter residents.

				<br />What&#039;s sad is that once again this is the haves (people who suddenly becoming conservative once they have kids, people worried about &#039;property values&#039;) being pitted against the have nots (homeless), and then who gets to sit back and watch everybody battle it out?&nbsp; Our elected officials.<br /><br />Instead, both parties should unite against our cities, states and federal government.&nbsp; Where is the outrage over lack of jobs?....affordable housing?...healthcare...and healthcare that includes coverage for mental health care?&nbsp; We have the highest prison population in the entire world.&nbsp; Surely this has a domino effect on families that are broken up, and then the mom and kids become homeless.<br /><br />Plenty of money for wars, but we never seem to have enough for basic needs for our own tax-paying citizens.<br />

				I always thought Upper Ditmars was technically Jackson Heights even though every one says Astoria Heights, since it&#039;s in the 11370 zip code. The Post Office says 11370 (and 11369) are &#039;East Elmhurst&#039;. I prefer &#039;Upper Ditmars&#039; myself, but whatever, I won&#039;t quibble. <br /><br /><br />Demographically though, it&#039;s Astoria, and that particular part of East Elmhurst/Jackson Heights/Trainsmeadow (yeah it&#039;s a real name) is like the rest of that part of Astoria and is predominantly white.
