				Yeah, I didn&#039;t win at $250 million. Bummer. <br /><br />Interestingly, the expected value of your $1 ticket is now more than $1! For the $325 million prize, the cash-value payout is now $181.1 million (http://www.megamillions.com/winningpicks/draw_details8282007.htm), which is better than the 175.7 million-to-one odds of actually winning (http://www.megamillions.com/howtoplay/game_rules.asp)!<br /><br />Of course, that doesn&#039;t count the roughly 50% taxes you&#039;ll be paying on your winnings, nor does it count the likelihood that more than one person will actually win, and split your paycheck in half. So the real expected value is still 50 cents or so, alas.<br /><br />And also, the economic benefit of winning $300 million instead of $30 million isn&#039;t that significant, in many ways. You&#039;ll be able to buy the largest and most lavish apartment in Manhattan, for cash, instead of the largest and most lavish apartment in Park Slope, for cash. Whatever. <br /><br />But I&#039;ll still buy a couple of tickets.<br />

				If you agree to the following terms please reply here indicating so:<br /><br />1. You agree to buy one ticket.<br />2. You agree that you will keep the first $10 million (after tax) for yourself.<br />3. You agree to give everyone who agrees to these terms by posting in this thread (and themselves can produce that they bought one ticket) one million dollars of your prize money should you win.<br />4. That should the prize money not be enough to pay everyone who agrees to these terms one million dollars each, that the money will be divided among all the party equally.<br />5. That should your prize money satisfy all terms of this agreement, that the rest is yours to keep.<br /><br />Buying a ticket and agreeing to these terms also entitles you to one million dollars should another party member win.

				See, now I&#039;m coming up with questions.<br /><br />1. This agreement only applies to the 8/31/07 drawing, right? Like, if I win 15 years from now, you guys aren&#039;t allowed to hunt me down or go on Oprah saying I screwed you over.<br />2. What if 4 different people have to split the jackpot? (It would be around $81M each, if $325M is correct.) Are the terms still the same?<br /><br />Not complaining, just verifying. As long as I get enough to pay off my, my sister&#039;s and my best friends&#039; student loans, my parents&#039; debt (not a ton, but there&#039;s some), buy a new car (my dream car is around $18K, so it&#039;s &quot;cheap&quot;), and travel a bit, I&#039;ll be thrilled. Oh, and having rent and a non-street parking spot covered for a little while would be really nice too. (The non-street parking spot because my dream car is a convertible, and those are some easy targets!) Oh and it would be really nice to be able to give my friends and family nice/cool Christmas gifts this year since I&#039;ve been living on a tight budget the past few years and have had to either agree not to exchange gifts or be really creative with $20.<br /><br />I am thinking so small, but it doesn&#039;t matter because 36 hours from now, I&#039;m gonna be a Mega-Millionaire! And I will drink from diamond-crusted glasses and own flying cars and have a fountain soda machine (fountain soda is so much better than bottled).&nbsp; :lol: (This is why I rarely play the lottery - I sit around and think about everything I&#039;m gonna do and who/what organizations I&#039;m gonna gift money to when I win, and then I don&#039;t win, and I&#039;m in a funk for the rest of the night.)

				Greedy eblack. I&#039;m playing two numbers myself and both are in. When you win you&#039;ll just claim it was one of the &quot;other&quot; tickets. That won&#039;t be fair. :)<br /><br />Like you couldn&#039;t afford $5mil if you get $325.<br /><br />Oh, and yes the agreement is just for this drawing. The agreement specifies what happens if you have to split the jackpot. You are guaranteed the first $10M you win no matter what, then the next portion you have to give $1M to each person in the pool, then the rest is yours.

				OK, got my two tickets.

However, we might be able to hire a lawyer who could set things up such that the $1 million are only taxed once, instead of twice...)

				Haha, I just bought my tickets a little while ago, and I was talking to the lady at the deli, and she was telling me how she&#039;s gonna skip town if I win since &quot;You win, and I get money for selling you the ticket, and we all get money!&quot; I was all, &quot;aw, no, you can&#039;t abandon the deli, you&#039;re the sweet deli lady!&quot; (Kidding, of course :) - but how much do they get if they sell the winning ticket? Just curious.)<br /><br />(I have 2 sets of numbers I&#039;m playing. I used to do quick picks for these big drawings, but I have a Very Scientific Method for guessing numbers now...heh.)<br /><br />Also, she gave me a little plastic/nylon envelope to keep my tickets in. I&#039;m guessing this is for people to keep their tickets in their cars or whatever. It is very fancy schmancy and I am feeling like a high roller already.<br /><br />Also, eblack, you&#039;re in or you&#039;re out! Chooooooose!

So gimme about a week to meet with people, then you guys can be mega millionaries with me.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think there&#039;s any way of your name not getting out - doesn&#039;t the NY Lottery release your name when you claim your prize? Is there a way to claim it anonymously? It&#039;s totally gonna be on the news, especially when the jackpot is as big as it is tonight.

And it&#039;s on a website that everyone (even non-members, they&#039;d just have to google the winning numbers) can see. How funny would it be to turn on the news and see my avatar on channel 4 saying &quot;where is this girl?&quot; Haha, I would totally go into hermit mode.<br /><br />Maybe we can PM our numbers to one person who will pinky swear not to say anything until the winner is ready?<br /><br />Yes, I realize how paranoid I sound.
