				This looks like a lot of fun.&nbsp; I just totally signed up for this.&nbsp; It&#039;s exercise, charity, and drinking.&nbsp; Three things we should all endorse and support.&nbsp; <br />It&#039;s $65 if you sign up by 2/15 and you can request people to be on your team.&nbsp; I think it&#039;ll be fun.&nbsp; Who&#039;s with me?!

				How many sessions and any more info - I might be crazy enough to try it out. At least it seems safer than rugby

				There are 6 regular season games in the league (more if you make playoffs!).<br /><br />The league now is having a blast and teams (including the ones who just met when we put them on teams together) are planning to come back next season.&nbsp; <br /><br />Want to come out and meet people and see what we&#039;re all about?&nbsp; We&#039;re throwing a Zog party at The Irish Rover (our post-game happy hour bar) on <strong>Tuesday, February 19</strong>.&nbsp; We&#039;ll have some great drink specials and you can ask the Zog staffers and the participants all about the league!<br /><br />I&#039;ll be putting up another post as soon as soon as all the details are lined up.&nbsp; In the meantime, feel free to ask me any questions by responding to this post!

				I like rage-based sports like dodgeball and racquetball, not peace-based sports like running.
