			Take Root presents Sarah Starkweather and Muliebris Dance Theatre<br />&nbsp;<br />Sarah Starkweather: Fin de la noche is a multidisciplinary performance that underscores the adverse effects of light pollution on the ecosystem and human condition. From a bird&#039;s eye view, Sarah Starkweather explores archetypal imagery of light and darkness to present a familiar, yet idiosyncratic, blend of contemporary movement that evokes nostalgia and stimulates the senses. Fin&#039;s undertones are deeply rooted through each individual dancer&#039;s metamorphic experiences as professionals in the city shared with a contrasting nuance that spotlights the grit and glam of show business. Lastly, Starkweather and her dancers would like to promote Earth Hour which is happens once a year around the globe, where millions of people, businesses, and landmarks set aside an hour to host events, switch off their lights, and make noise for climate change action. Next year, you can participate on Saturday, March 24, 2018, from 8:30-9:30pm EST. Carpe Noctum!<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Muliebris Dance Theatre’s collaboration with sound designer Asha Tamirisa creates three different dimensions, each containing its own properties and questions. In each, women work together to battle against unseen forces. What does it mean to be female? We see them perform rituals, immersed in nature: hair down, unbound, returning the gaze—a celebration of female strength and communal power.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;September 22 &amp; 23, 2017 at 8pm<br />&nbsp;Admission: $15 online, $20 at the door<br />&nbsp;Green Space Studio<br />&nbsp;37-24 24th Street, #301<br />&nbsp;Long Island City, NY 11101<br />&nbsp;718-956-3037<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Tickets are available at the door or online at http://www.greenspacestudio.org/TakeRoot.html<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Take Root is a monthly curated series that supports dance makers by providing an opportunity to show a half evening work paired with another artist.
