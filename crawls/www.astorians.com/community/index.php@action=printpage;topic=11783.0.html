				I think it is&nbsp; alive, but, &#039;well?&#039;&nbsp; I think many today&nbsp; do not understand&nbsp; what the first amendment&nbsp; means. What does&nbsp; it mean to you, folks?&nbsp; <br /><br />To me, it&nbsp; means&nbsp; having spirited&nbsp; debate, devoid of speech codes. I also think people&nbsp; have a responsibility&nbsp; to back up opinion with fact. Of course, this doesn&#039;t mean it all has to be&nbsp; some snarling, angry mess, one can have fun along the way.&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />

				I wonder why someone thumbed down the above post.<br /><br />&quot;Speech codes&quot; are harmful to all of us.&#160; Free speech cuts both ways.&#160; Sure, it seems well and good when a college bans what they consider to be offensive speech.&#160; But what happens when they want to abridge your free speech rights?<br /><br />This is not a partisan conservative/liberal issue.

But academia has become overwhelmingly left since the 1950s.&nbsp; So there is not much exposure to anything other than theories and ideas I disagree with.&nbsp; Most of the conservatives from the think tank community are mainly concerned that students recieve haven&#039;t been receiving some grounding in classic texts.&nbsp; Many of the classics are being thrown aside as specialized (and some would argue silly) fields of study develop.<br /><br />For more on conservative thought on the state of academia: http://www.mindingthecampus.org/

If he is presenting the &quot;blowback&quot; theory of 9/11 with different points and counterpoints, that would be one thing. For placing blame on the victims who happen to be working there during the attack, and referring to them as &quot;little Eichmann&#039;s&quot; he opened himself for firing for being a f*&amp;%ing moron. On the right, I can&#039;t think of any serious thinker who think that a Michael Savage should be a tenured professor at a State University. Why does it take a plagiarism claim to strip this cretin of his job? Isn&#039;t &quot;you are just not that bright&quot; a good enough reason to fire someone from his coveted position?
