				My hotmail account was hacked into. For the last hour, while hotmail&#039;s crack team of employees aren&#039;t resetting my password,&nbsp; my friends have been conversing with the scum who have sent everyone in my address book an email about what a lucrative opportunity I have found in England while attending a youth program.<br /><br />And I&#039;m a paying customer. I have only the small satisfaction of having been able to cancel my subscription in the meantime. <br /><br />

				This happened to someone else I know over the weekend, though I think she is a gmail user. <br /><br />nocleverusername, did you have a strong password? I&#039;m wondering if I should change all of mine....

				I did, but I think my downfall was saving it to my computer. For a brief second last night for whatever reason, my wireless connection became unsecured. I didn&#039;t think anything of it because a split second later it appeared secured again. Maybe that&#039;s when it happened. <br /><br />The other thing is that my hotmail and Messenger are always signed on when the computer is on... does anyone know if that makes hacking passwords easier?

				It&#039;s been 6 hours since I reported the &quot;hijacking&quot; (their reference not mine) of my account to hotmail and they still have not reset my password. <br /><br />My friends have all had lovely, humorous conversations with the scammer though all day

				I&#039;m sorry to hear about your misfortune. I don&#039;t have hotmail but I have been hijacked twice in the last 6 years and both times it took awhile (more than 3 weeks) to get it straightened out. I hope everything works out and in a speedy fashion.

				I just found a random post online about how enthusiastic some dude was that it <em>only </em>took hotmail 2 and half days to reset his account like that was praiseworthy or something.... but now hearing your plight maybe it was. <br />AOL use to do it with a phone call. I hate the amount of junk mail I get with them, but I&#039;m probably going back when this is all said and done.

				For $20 a year they&#039;ll up your storage limit and contact list. There&#039;s also no chance you&#039;ll loose your account if you don&#039;t sign in.
