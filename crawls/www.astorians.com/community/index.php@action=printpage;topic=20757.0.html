				My fiance and I have lived here for a year, and the only reason we are leaving is because we have bought a house in New Rochelle. This is the upstairs of a 2 family house. It has 2 large bedrooms and 1 small bedroom. The small bedroom is good for an office or changing room. Also, there is a dining room. Decent closet space. Granite countertops in eat-in kitchen. Ceiling fans in kitchen, living room and main bedroom. Hardwood floors in most of house. Landlords are an older Italian couple who are very nice. Rent is $1,800/month, and there&#039;s no brokerage fee. They are looking ideally for a couple, possibly with a child. You can move in on May 15th, and possibly a couple days prior. First month rent and security deposit would be due to the landlord if you take the apartment.<br /><br />Shoot me an email if you&#039;re interested and I&#039;ll put you in touch with the landlord&#039;s daughter, who is also very nice and helpful.<br /><br />Josh

				Hey everyone. This apartment is still available. One additional piece of information I should mention is that the landlords are looking for a couple, without a child. Rent is $1,800/month and there is no fee.<br /><br />Thanks!

				Thanks for the reply and explanation, Eddie. Now, to get back on topic... To clarify, this is the UPSTAIRS unit of the 2 family house. The landlords are a lovely older couple, and are very nice. Their daughter is always available if/when any issues arise with the apartment, and wants to ensure that her parents can continue to live comfortably and quietly in their own home. But this doesn&#039;t mean you have to be hermits. I play my saxophone in the apartment, and there are absolutely no issues whatsoever. As they are older, they like to know who is living above them and don&#039;t want tons of unknown people coming and going, which is why they would like a couple. <br /><br />The bottom line is, we&#039;ve had a great time living here, we&#039;re trying to help the landlords fill the place when we leave because they&#039;ve been really nice to us. And you&#039;re not going to find a better deal or nicer place for $1,800 in Astoria anymore. This place is a steal.<br /><br />One last point, we own a car, and parking has generally been a breeze. There are almost always spots to be had within a block of our apartment. It&#039;s a quiet block. Tree lined, etc...<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Josh

				under the Fair Housing Act, a landlord can discriminate if the building has 4 or fewer units, and the landlord lives on the premises.&nbsp; However it is ALWAYS illegal to publish any kind of ad expressing that kind of discrimination, including a posting on a website like Astorians.com.&nbsp; <br /><br />and, NYC law seems to be more protective of tenants than federal law.&nbsp; <br /><br />Prohibited activity.<br /><br />It is unlawful for the owner, lessor, lessee, sublessee, real estate broker, assignee, or other person having the right of ownership, the right of possession, or the right to rent or lease any housing accommodations, or any agent or employee of such person to: <br /><br />A.<br />Refuse to rent or lease, or otherwise deny to or withhold from any person such accommodations because such person has a minor child or children who shall occupy the leased or rented premises with such person; <br /><br />B.<br />Represent to any person because of the potential tenancy of a minor child or children that housing accommodations are not available for inspection or rental when such dwelling is in fact so available; <br /><br />C.<br />Make, print, or publish, or cause to be made, printed or published any notice, statement, or advertisement, with respect to the rental of housing accommodations that indicates any preference, limitation, or discrimination based on the potential tenancy of a minor child or children; <br /><br />D.<br />Discriminate against any person in the terms, conditions or privileges of the rental of housing accommodations or in the provision of services or facilities in connection therewith, because of the potential tenancy of a minor child or children; <br /><br />E.<br />Refuse to rent after the making of a bona fide offer, or to refuse to negotiate for the rental of, or otherwise make unavailable or deny, housing accommodations to any person because of the potential tenancy of a minor child or children; <br /><br />F.<br />Include in any lease or rental agreement of housing accommodations a clause providing that as a condition of continued tenancy the tenants shall remain childless or shall not bear children. <br /><br />(Ord. 382 § 1(part), 1984: Ord. 290 §§ 1(part), 3(part), 1979). <br /><br />

				rebb_, this is interesting stuff. Thanks for posting.<br /><br />Were you quoting from the NYC statute? Does the quoted text mean that the exception for owner-occupied buildings of 4 or fewer units does <strong>not</strong> apply in NYC, at least with respect to discrimination based on children?<br /><br />It sounds like a fantastic apartment -- I hope you find a good successor, JTrane! Sorry to hear you&#039;re leaving Astoria, but congrats on the house purchase!

				An update...<br /><br />I spoke to the landlord&#039;s daughter, and they are actually closing off the smallest bedroom. They will be using it for a space for the home health aid that lives with the landlords downstairs. It&#039;s a very small room, though, and won&#039;t make too big of a difference. So it&#039;ll be a 2 bedroom when available on May 15.<br /><br />I should also clarify that they didn&#039;t say they wouldn&#039;t rent to someone with children, simply that their preference is to not rent to someone with children. If a great couple with a child comes along, they would certainly be open to it, I think. And is it really necessary to post all that info here? I&#039;m certainly not condoning discrimination of people with children (especially as I hope to have kids myself), but I ask anyone here to prove when a landlord discriminates. If a landlord has multiple tenant applicants, they can choose whoever they want, for whatever reason they want, and there&#039;s no way to prove it&#039;s for any particular reason. So please, can we stay on topic, and if you&#039;re interested in the place, let me know. Otherwise, please keep posts in this thread related to interest in the apartment.<br /><br />I&#039;m simply trying to help them out and get this place rented.
