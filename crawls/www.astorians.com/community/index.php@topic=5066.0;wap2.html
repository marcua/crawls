			Hi guys,<br /><br />For those of you that are addicts I need to know something.<br /><br />Occasionally while I&#39;m surfing the board I get &quot;timeouts&quot; where the site stops responding for about 30 seconds, but it can be as long as about 2 minutes. Whenever I try and reload the page I get nothing. It happens pretty frequently.<br /><br />Does this happen to anyone else on a regular basis? I&#39;m trying to troubleshoot if this is a server thing, or something with my computer or ISP.

			Sometimes, but it usually doesn&#39;t last long at all.

			I do get them sometimes, and it seems to be more frequent lately, but the internet seems to be slower in general, particularly at home (although also a little slow at work).&nbsp; It has seemed slower, with more timeouts, for several weeks now.

			Yes, I see this from time to time too. I&#39;m not sure, but it may only happen at work, which would be interesting, as I use OpenDNS at home, but the usual DNS channels at work. I wonder if there&#39;s a transient name service issue?<br />
