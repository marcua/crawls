				Hey, y&#039;all. Thought I would get on the bandwagon early. I live up in the Ditmars area and would really like to get in on the Hellgate CSA. I haven&#039;t had a share in the past, and a whole share would be way too much for lil&#039; me, so I thought I would check here to see if anyone who had a share in the past would be interested in splitting one with me.

				If you are interested in splitting a share, send an email with both your names to be placed on the waiting list.&nbsp; We can&#039;t guarantee a share, but you&#039;ll have a chance!&nbsp; &nbsp;:mrgreen:&nbsp; The waiting list is first come, first served.<br /><br />The email address can be found on the link you posted above.

				I&#039;m also hoping to find a share partner for Hellgate CSA.&nbsp; I&#039;m on the waiting list for a full share, but it sounds like that will happen when Hellgate freezes over :wink:
