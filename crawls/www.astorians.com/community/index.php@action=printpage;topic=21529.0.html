				Hi All,<br />&nbsp;<br />I&#039;m looking for a place, October 1st Move in date, near public transportation, and some form of guaranteed parking would be necessary. My max is $1750/$1800. Any assistance and help would be great!<br />&nbsp;<br />Thanks

				Realtor showed me a place on 29th st; 31-21 29th st near 31st ave. Anybody live there before and can provide feedback? <br />&nbsp;<br />I&#039;m kind of skeptical moving into a pre-war as I prefer a new building.

				That&#039;s a fantastic area of the neighborhood to be in. I haven&#039;t been inside that particular building, but walk by it all the time and it seems well-managed, and the residents I&#039;ve met there have all been friendly. I tend to prefer (*well-maintained*) pre-war buildings to new construction myself: in general more solid walls, larger rooms, more interesting layouts, more character.<br /><br /><br />Have you looked at the listings at www.urbanedgeny.com? They have apartments in the new rental building under the train at 31st St and Broadway. Most (though not all) are above your stated max, but you don&#039;t pay a broker fee for those apartments so might balance out.<br /><br /><br />If you plan to stay in the area long-term, for $1800 a month or just a bit over you can buy an apartment in the neighborhood and enjoy the tax benefits. Of course you&#039;ll need a hefty down payment.<br /><br /><br />None of those options (including the apartment you saw, I assume) have guaranteed parking though.

				Thanks for the reply! <br />&nbsp;<br />The building definitely seems well maintanted. <br />&nbsp;<br />I kind of gave up on the dedicated parking space idea. At this point, if I find anything near the Broadway/31st st area its fine.<br />&nbsp;<br />I&#039;m hesitant about pre-war&#039;s; call me strange but I&#039;m personally not a fan of the older look and appeal.&nbsp; I even asked the realtor if I could change the crystal door knobs inside the apartment ---not a fan but definitely something to consider.<br />&nbsp;<br />Appreciate the feedback!

				I can understand not being a fan of the older look, but keep in mind that with the right paint and furnishings a pre-war can look quite modern. Check out this one, which is actually right across the street from the one you looked at:<br /><br /><br />http://streeteasy.com/nyc/sale/627737-coop-25-40-31st-avenue-astoria<br /><br />

				If you by chance you decide on the pre-war and want to change the crystal door knobs please let me know. I&#039;ve been looking for them for quite a while.<br />Thanks,<br />B

				I think I&#039;ve decided, I&#039;m just more comfortable with a new construction.<br />&nbsp;<br />If anyone can give me leads to any 1 bedrooms available in a new building that&#039;d be great!<br />&nbsp;<br />Sorry birikina, I definitely would have given you the crystal knobs!

				I have a 1 bedroom available at the Pistilli building 19-19 24th Avenue.&nbsp; It is on the 6th floor across from Astoria Park.&nbsp; This apartment is one of the few with no problems.&nbsp; No leaks.&nbsp; Huge balcony.&nbsp; Rent is $2,100, and a parking spot in the building is available for an extra $100.&nbsp; I&#039;m actually looking for someone to take over my lease.&nbsp; Contact me if you&#039;re interested. I can send you a photo album with pics if need be.
