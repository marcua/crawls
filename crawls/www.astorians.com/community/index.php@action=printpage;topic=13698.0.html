				Before I state just what I&#039;m a human guinea pig for, here obviously is another all-purpose thread.&nbsp; About to take the plunge with some person, place or product?&nbsp; Tell everybody about it!&nbsp; Maybe just maybe someone will know something dreadful about it and keep you from committing a grevious error!<br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;m a Human Guinea Pig for magicJack voip phone.&nbsp; My friend up in Connecticut is having tough fiscal times (who isn&#039;t these days) and where she is her computer is hooked up via a wifi network to broadband.&nbsp; I loudly suggested getting rid of the landline and I sent her a magicJack, which after you spend ~$40 plus shipping and tax means free local and us canada long distance for the first year, and $20 per year thereafter (will there be thereafter years who knows).&nbsp; So she&#039;ll get it mid-week, and I&#039;ll say how it went.<br />

				I&#039;m a human guinea pig for playing all 1000000 games of Microsoft Freecell. &nbsp;I&#039;m up to game 135. &nbsp;I keep track of what games I played on an Excel spreadsheet because the sheet is numbered on the left, to the side of the actual spreadsheet. &nbsp;The spreadsheet itself I have decorated so I have something other than blank cells to look at. &nbsp;I took a look at the spreadsheet for the first 100 games to see how many kb the spreadsheet was using up, to see if I was going to have to eventually move it off my hard drive. &nbsp;The MB count for 1000000 games was so high that I realized I would have to periodically Delete Contents of the previous 100 games to keep the KB count low. &nbsp;(I can&#039;t simply delete previous rows or I would lose the count at the left hand side.) &nbsp;By deleting contents of previous games I lose the visual impact of having the decorations for all 1000000 games, but I figured, am I really going to scroll up 1000000 rows to look at them? &nbsp;No.<br /><br />My decorations on the spreadsheet look something like this, and are repeated every 10 games, changing color schemes every 50. &nbsp;On the actual spreadsheet the thing that looks like an a with a degree symbol over it is a Webdings martini glass. &nbsp;On this copy &amp; paste the right side martini glasses are out of alignment. &nbsp;They should be in a straight column, and some of the card symbols are out of alignment. &nbsp;The whole thing is actually symetrical.<br /><br />å&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;♥&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;♣&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;å&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;♠&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;♦&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;å<br />å&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;♥&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;♣&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freecell&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;♠&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;♦&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;å<br />å&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;♥&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;♣&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;å&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;♠&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;♦&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;å<br />
