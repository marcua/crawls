				I went to the eye doctor and found out that my eyesight has improved a little bit since I last went. There wasn&#039;t really a need to change my prescription, but I wanted new frames so I decided to go ahead with it. I picked up my new glasses on Saturday and it felt really weird at first, but I figured I probably just needed to get used to them so I wore them for the next few hours. Afterwards my right eye felt really strained, but by the end of the day my eye felt mostly fine.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t wear them at all yesterday, but I wore them again today since it&#039;s a workday. I wore them off and on all day since I am nearsighted and don&#039;t need them to read or work on the computer. Whenever I wore them though my eyes felt really weird again - like my prescription was stronger instead of weaker and/or like they were bifocals which I don&#039;t need at this point.<br /><br />Part of the weirdness is that I feel shorter (not something I care to feel), and that I feel a little sick to my stomach.<br /><br />To be honest this is the first time I&#039;ve changed my prescription. I first got glasses back in 2000 I think, and have never needed to change it. I did get a different shape so I thought that maybe the shape was throwing me off. <br /><br />So is it just me or does my prescription sound effed up?

				Go back and complain. If you were comfortable with your old prescription it might be best for you. If you are middle aged - by becoming slightly more far sighted with age - your near sightedness might diminish - otherwise I think it&#039;s unlikely.&nbsp; Give it one or 2 days - possibly your eyes will adjust - otherwise I&#039;d go back and ask for my original script. Good luck

				I&#039;ve got 2 thoughts.<br /><br />1) If you used an optometrist have them check your eyes again. Perhaps there was an error the first time and the script needs to be changed. Hopefully, if the optometrist is associated with the place you bought the new glasses they have to do the new ones for free.<br /><br />2) If you used an ophthalmologist take your new glasses and have them check to be sure the glass matches the script. (My doctor always insists they she check new glasses before I use them to be sure they are correct.)
