				I was on Steinway Street today, near Broadway, and noticed a metal sign on a lamp post that said something like NYPD Security Camera (or Surveillance Camera).&nbsp; It was on the lamp post in front of the Bank of America.&nbsp; I have never seen this sign before or anywhere else in Astoria and was wondering if there are more cameras like this in other parts of Astoria.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think it is a good idea.&nbsp; I know there are PD security cameras in the subway but have never seen any above ground.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				There are bazillions of them in lower Manhattan. I think everyone who works downtown is gonna have to join actors&#039; equity soon. No signs on them though.<br /><br />There is a sign (probably the one you saw) in front of the construction site across from the library on Broadway. I suspect it&#039;s there to discourage people from treating the site as an off-hours Home Depot store.&nbsp; The camera that goes with it is either very artfully disguised, or imaginary.<br /><br />It seems a bit orwellian to me; I&#039;d rather see a policeman or two walking a beat. <br /><br />I wonder - who watches all these things. Do you suppose there are thousands of people in hyderabad watching for me put books into the library return slot improperly?

				I saw it weeks ago as it was already covered in the local press. I have no problem with it. In fact several previous threads on local crimes, attacks on women and thugs attacking people have asked just for this. There are cameras almost everywhere, it is a sign of the times.

				I&#039;ve not seen the one by the construction site and I live right around the corner.&nbsp; I&#039;m curious to see where it is.&nbsp; I was actually driving down Steinway when I saw the one by Bank of America and did not see where the camera was at all.&nbsp; The sign was clearly visible.&nbsp; That&#039;s unusual that these to cams would be right around the corner from each other but I guess that is a very active crossway with the subway stop nearby and so much other stuff going on.&nbsp; I wonder if those cams have ever come in handy to the NYPD?&nbsp; The sign itself has to be somewhat of a deterrent but it&#039;s really so high up that it&#039;s hard to see.

				I saw the cameras over on the corner this morning.&nbsp; It seems the sign is gone from the construction site too. Probably taken by vandals.
