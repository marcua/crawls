				Looks like they had a &quot;soft opening&quot; with no announcement. Shelves are mostly bare but they do have a large beverage selection and some meat at the counter. I popped in last night to look around and saw who I assumed to be the owners. They were standing about halfway behind the counter, far enough that they didn&#039;t appear to be customers. I glanced over at them a couple times and they saw me. Not even a simple hello from them. No are you looking for anything specific, no feelers to see if I wanted to know what they would eventually have in stock, nothing. I truly hope I&#039;m wrong in assuming they were the owners. I&#039;m eager to see if they pull off what I think is the potential for a great store. But if they were in fact the owners, they need to appreciate the people of the town a bit more and be friendly. I was really put off by this. Anyone else stop in here yet?

				I saw it but didn&#039;t go in.&nbsp; It looks like a strange place to me.&nbsp; I saw what looked like a giant thigh bone on a table in the front of the store.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if people were eating samples from it.&nbsp; What exactly is this place supposed to be?&nbsp; Is it like a butcher shop?&nbsp; I don&#039;t think people know what to make of this new and unusual business.&nbsp; They say they get the meat from their farm...&nbsp; I don&#039;t know what kind of farm they have

				it sucks that this place is so lame - I hope they get their act together soon, it&#039;s a great idea and bbq/smoked meats are very &quot;in&quot; these days.&nbsp; Astoria could use a <strong>good</strong> bbq joint.&nbsp;

				It might be &quot;in&quot; for now. which is why it&#039;s done so low key with not a lot spent on decor. Because when it not &quot;in&quot; anymore, they won&#039;t lose as much when they switch to a sushi place or coffee bar.

				Got a pulled pork sandwich from here last night.&nbsp; It was delicious!!&nbsp; The pork was moist, the slaw on top of the sandwich was perfect.&nbsp; &nbsp;I really do hope they figure out their business plan though.&nbsp; So much potential for greatness here.&nbsp; The great meat was a good start.&nbsp; I will definitely be going back.&nbsp;

				So is this place only for takeout or could you eat it there too?&nbsp; Like I said, I don&#039;t know what to make of this place.&nbsp; Is it a butcher shop, a restaurant, a takeout place.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know

				Has anybody else tried this place?&nbsp; If so, what do you think of it?&nbsp; I noticed they put small tables for people to sit down in the front of the store.&nbsp; Now it looks more like a restaurant.&nbsp; I walked past there this weekend and didn&#039;t see anybody inside.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t seem to be doing such good business.&nbsp; As for myself, it doesn&#039;t look like a very welcoming place to walk in to

				ha, yeah seriously Braun just go inside and take a look.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />I went in last weekend and they were extremely welcoming inside.&nbsp; Others were in the store perusing as well.&nbsp; &nbsp;Think along the lines of Butcher Bar...but more market/butcher and less restaurant.&nbsp; There are a few tables to sit and eat but i got the feel that it was more market/butcher.&nbsp; they had some beautiful looking pork chops that looks as good or better than Flying Pigs at the Union Square Farmers market.&nbsp; I was surprised to see that.&nbsp; Also, the meat was offered both fresh or frozen.&nbsp; I like that.&nbsp; &nbsp;I was also happy to see farm fresh eggs (albeit a little steap at $6/dozen).&nbsp; &nbsp;The pork products looked exceptionally good (pork chops, bacon, etc).&nbsp; I did not buy anything but I do plan on doing so in the future. <br /><br /><br />While i was in there they gave a woman in the store a sample of their brisket.&nbsp; &nbsp;She ate and and said that she was an admitted brisket snob...and thought it was delicious.&nbsp; &nbsp;I did not try anything so i cannot speak for it first hand but this what i overheard.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Overall though, I thought it was a nice store and it was well stocked for a new place.&nbsp; &nbsp;They had fresh chickens and meats that I look forward to trying.&nbsp; The stuff appeared to be the real deal too, from a true farm.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am from the east end of long island, near Riverhead and I am happy to see this place in Astoria.&nbsp; &nbsp;I look forward to trying their products.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Now, if only they would carry Briemere pies...<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve been thinking about what this place is lacking and I think I figured it out:&nbsp; lighting.&nbsp; If you look left and right of Nature&#039;s Taste (and all up and down the street), every sign, marquee or awning is lit, either internally or with flood lights shining on the sign.&nbsp; This is what Nature&#039;s Taste needs, flood lights to light up their sign.&nbsp; &nbsp;That and those god awful fluorescent lights in the entry way.&nbsp; The food is good, the products they sell are good...they just need to fix the lighting and things will fall in place.
