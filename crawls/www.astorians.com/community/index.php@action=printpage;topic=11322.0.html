				Nicest thing about poetry is that you walk around and live your life and there are sometimes you just need a new way to scream what has been dominating your mind.&nbsp; If you have one rolling around in your brain, post it.<br /><br />Stuck in an office on a day like today instead of being at the beach, always brings this to mind<br /><br /><strong>Denial by Giorgos Seferis</strong><br /><br />On the secret seashore<br />white like a pigeon<br />we thirsted at noon; <br />but the water was brackish.<br /><br />On the golden sand<br />we wrote her name; <br />but the sea-breeze blew<br />and the writing vanished.<br /><br />With what spirit, what heart, <br />what desire and passion<br />we lived our life: a mistake! <br />So we changed our life. <br />&nbsp;

				This is a great idea! Flash fiction should be next. I&#039;m experimenting with an anti-septic, post-modern style right now. <br /><br />Ms. Kiss, Kiss, Kiss<br /><br />I see you flutter by<br />One year plus drinking age and I think you&#039;re fun<br />You tell me that you&#039;ve got a date tomorrow night<br />and I want to hear more<br /><br />You say he&#039;s just a casual hookup<br />and you don&#039;t like him - not really<br />I say, &quot;right on. I understand&quot;<br />I&#039;m like that too but you&#039;ve got a pretty smile<br /><br />You smell like a garden<br />You tell me it&#039;s soap<br />But it&#039;s something more divine than that<br />Something greater<br />You say it&#039;s pheromones<br />I say it&#039;s MHC<br />Either way, I agree but I still don&#039;t know<br />what I&#039;m talking about <br />That&#039;s what I tell you (but I really do)<br /><br />I&#039;ve only been here for five minutes<br />and I want to kiss you<br />I&#039;ve only been here for five minutes<br />and I want you<br /><br />Ding! A bell rings and you have to <br />drop off some plates of food at some<br />couple&#039;s table<br /><br />I&#039;m interested in you<br />But I just want to talk<br />Your body - beautiful<br />There&#039;s no such thing as mindless chatter<br />with you<br />I can tell<br />

				An old favorite of mine:<br /><br />Lending Out Books by Hal Sirowitz<br /><br />You&#039;re always giving, my therapist said.<br />You have to learn how to take. Whenever<br />you meet a woman, the first thing you do<br />is lend her your books. You think she&#039;ll<br />have to see you again in order to return them.<br />But what happens is, she doesn&#039;t have the time<br />to read them, &amp; she&#039;s afraid if she sees you again<br />you&#039;ll expect her to talk about them, &amp; will<br />want to lend her even more. So she<br />cancels the date. You end up losing<br />a lot of books. You should borrow hers.<br />

				ADIEU<br /><br />&quot;Sayonara&quot;<br />is always harder than &quot;How are you, nice to meet you&quot;<br />...unless I&#039;d like to see you<br />nevermore, and my life can breach you,<br />bleach you,<br />delete you,<br />and make you disappear<br />in a wisp of air<br />to a place of which noone is aware.<br />Which or where it is? I care not,<br />as long as it&#039;s a place that we share not,<br />that is near not,<br />where nothing touch my interests,<br />and it gets nothing but indifference.<br />And to this rare spot,<br />you can make your humble entrance<br />and there rot<br />until beneath your burial plot, you hear God;<br />and at the moment that you walk with Him,<br />it&#039;s only then that we will talk again.<br /><br />my apologies for the bitterness...the subject of this one really angered me. i have more positive stuff at www.myspace.com/sintexera
