				Hi,&nbsp; I was backing up and to make a long story short i scraped the side of my car, above the back right tire and dented it a bit with a stupid short cement pole i could not see!&nbsp; I am looking for a shop so i can take it for quotes on how much the paint would cost and taking the dent out.&nbsp; Any info will be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks!
