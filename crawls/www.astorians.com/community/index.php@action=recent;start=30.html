					<div class="list_posts">kinds of things. Watching televised presidential debates. Using the internet for all kinds of things before I eventually had internet service of my own.<br /><br /><br />The Astorians site itself....what stands out most of all is when Big Brian (Hawaiian Brian...he liked Hawaiian shirsts) passed away. like 15 years ago? I attended his wake. Met his sister Judy. Then we all met at an Astorians member&#039;s apartment (her name was Judy as well) had some food and actually met several Astorians in the flesh.<br />The funny thing, if there was one, was that everyone there thought &quot;mridue&quot; was short for &quot;mystery dude&quot;. I explained that I was an MRI Technologist and welcome chuckles were had by all. <br /><br /><br />Brian actually was a neighbor and lived up the street from me. Also across the street from St. John&#039;s Prep.<br /><br /><br />I also remember the never-ending &quot;Bed Bugs&quot; forum. <img src="http://www.astorians.com/community/Smileys/SoLoSMiLeYS1/rolleyes.gif" alt="&#58;rolleyes&#58;" title="rolleyes" class="smiley" /> ,&nbsp; The constant search by some for an affordable apartment.<br /><br /><br />The posting by Cadillacman about his friend and fellow homeless man, Chris, who died under the&nbsp; Railroad archway downtown.<br />I remembered Chris as well. I was cleaning out my tiny closet for some dire needed room and had several L.L.Bean Flannel shirts that no longer fit me. I washed them, bagged them, then saught out Chris on the streets.<br />I found him and offered them to him. The were warm shirts, and it was starting to get cold.<br /><br /><br />&quot;These are YOUR possessions?&quot; <br /><br /><br />Yes, they are.<br /><br /><br />&quot;Then I WILL TAKE THEM!&quot;<br /><br /><br />Astoria had it&#039;s share of Characters.<br /><br /><br />Bookbinder and I tried to get a &quot;Midnight Riders&quot; group going of Astorians who wanted to get together and ride bicycles in the neighborhood.<br /><br /><br />Meesh joined us on one of the early rides. We broke into the gate securing the Saint John&#039;s Prep athletic field and rode around the runner&#039;s track.<br />I told Meesh that we were probably going to get caught and get into trouble.<br /><br /><br />&quot;Come on! Don&#039;t be a coward! You live across the street. Have you ever been inside this gate?&quot;<br /><br /><br />Nope! That was the first and last time.<br /><br /><br />I miss Astoria.<br /><br /><br />Take care all!<br /><br /><br />Kevin (mridude...signing off....)</div>

					<div class="list_posts">Hey Merm&#039;!<br /><br /><br />mridude (Kevin),<br /><br /><br />Sorry to see this close, but I get that you need to get on with your life. I was last in Astoria around April. I had parked my car there and subwayed into Manhattan for a Job/Physical/Screening. I walked around a bit, Checked out some of the new stores. Noted the ones that were gone, Like FreezePeach, my local Oasis while I lived on 27th Street and Ditmars Blvd.<br />Many of my memories were intertwined with FreezePeach itself. The full-size poster of an early nonsurgically modified Michael Jackson on the bathroom door. Pixel, your cat, cornering a rat the size of a small beaver, Seeing people on the remote camera who appeared to LIVE there. You, teaching yourself a new, non-qwerty keyboard, looking into getting a HAM-Radio operators license, The small Christmas Tree festooned with green toy soldiers and various tanks, half-tracks and toy field artillery. Dubbed: &quot;Operation: Merry Christmas&quot;. The Knitty-Crafty ladies meeting to knit all</div>

Thanks for all your hard work building this forum and keeping it going for all these years!<br /><br />Years ago, I found a cat in the neighborhood, and I posted a photo of her here to see if she belonged to anyone.

					<div class="list_posts">Dear Astorians,<br /><br />I&#039;m writing to announce that this website will be closing down on December 31st.<br /><br />It&#039;s hard to believe this forum is over 17 years old. It all <a href="index.php@topic=2.msg2.html#msg2" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">started in 2004</a> when a small group of us realized there wasn&#039;t really a good online forum to share information about some of the great spots in Astoria and just talk about the neighborhood we loved. At first it was just a few of us posting on here, but as the &quot;<a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/freeze-peach-astoria" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">Freeze Peach Cafe</a>&quot; (managed by my partner Meesh and I) opened and the community around the cafe grew, this online community also grew bigger and bigger.<br /><br />For many years astorians.com was the most active community discussion site in the community, and it thrived with lots of active posts, and some awesome volunteer moderators that kept all of us relatively well behaved. Lots of people met here (some even got married!), and we talked A LOT about a lot of stuff.<br /><br />But here in 2021 it feels that there are more options than ever for discussing community issues online, and that the time for a site like this has largely faded. The activity level on the site is much lower than it was at its peak, and it&#039;s a significant struggle to try and keep things going and fend off spam (which admittedly I haven&#039;t done a great job of for a long time). Rather that let it get taken over by spammers and hackers I&#039;ve decided it&#039;s time to put the site to rest. All good things come to an end.<br /><br />Many thanks to all who have made this site possible and giving it life all these years:<br />Moderators or major contributors: mcdirk, daisy, AJTNYC, Astoria Luv, 28Grand, megc, wasabisam, jayme and others <br /><br />And of course; thank you.<br /><br />I&#039;d love if you took a moment to share a memory or two about how the site was useful to you through these years, or maybe a memory from your interactions with the people here.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />merm</div>
