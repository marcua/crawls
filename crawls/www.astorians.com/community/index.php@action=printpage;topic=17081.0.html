				Hey all - I have a question - I have some big holes around my radiator pipes where they meet the floor.&nbsp; I&#039;m busy caulking every hole in my apartment, in my all-out-war against the roaches that my nasty neighbors are unleashing on me.&nbsp; I&#039;ve read about stuffing steel wool into the bigger holes in your floors and walls, but what about the heating pipes?&nbsp; Will the steel wool catch fire if I use it to stuff the hole around the radiator pipe hole?&nbsp; It does get hot.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to start a fire!&nbsp; What works, people?&nbsp; I need help!<br /><br />Any and all help in defeating the pests would be most appreciated.&nbsp; I am asking my landlord to get an exterminator in here, but would like to take every measure possible, because they just crawl through the walls to my place from every other dirty apartment here.&nbsp; Seems to not matter how clean I am, this old house is just full of holes and I can&#039;t do much about the neighbors :(

				We just did something similar in our place and used steel wool to fill in the holes and then used spray foam from Home Depot (the single use bottle is about $4.00) for the top.&nbsp; You stuff the wool into the hole (I verified with my stepdad that it wouldn&#039;t be an issue with the radiator pipe) then filled in the gap with the foam.&nbsp; Then you wait about an hour and take a knife to level off the foam so you don&#039;t have a giant bubble.<br /><br />Hope this helps!

				Don&#039;t forget to take off the covers to your electrical sockets and put boric acid or roach gel in the empty spaces. Any kind of dark place like that is a place where roaches want to hide. Then you can put the expanding foam in before putting the covers back on.<br /><br />I have to say though, having a monthly exterminator in my current building resulted in my first roach-free place since moving to NYC.

				Thanks guys.&nbsp; That makes me feel better.&nbsp; I was having crazy imaginings of steel wool fires, lol.&nbsp; I&#039;ll get to the hardware store tomorrow and pick that foam up.<br /><br />Somehow I doubt I&#039;d ever get a monthly ext visit.&nbsp; Thanks for the tips on the sockets.

				I know you&#039;ve already made up your mind, but I&#039;ve had steel wool stuffed in the holes where the radiator comes in since 2005, and I&#039;ve had no problems.

				Thanks Alison.&nbsp; I went crazy today, and went through 2 bottles of caulk and one box of steel wool.&nbsp; And believe it or not, I&#039;m not done yet.&nbsp; This house is just so full of holes, it isn&#039;t funny!&nbsp; I&#039;ll have to go to the hardware store tomorrow and get more wool, caulk, rubber gloves, paper towels, and this foam stuff.&nbsp; Some of which I&#039;ll get at the good ol dollar store.&nbsp; <br /><br />My new mantra seems to be &quot;All roaches shall die&quot;.

				kempstern, do you hire yourself out as a hitman??&nbsp; :-D<br /><br />Our cat has been instrumental in keeping the roach population down. The only ones I used to find were already killed by her, and that was pretty rare. But after the ConEd debacle, when they were digging up the streets........well, you know&nbsp; :|<br /><br />Still, I think we&#039;re pretty lucky as they&#039;re once again pretty rare. The cat only caught one mouse from the radiator pipe; the bugs generally come in through somewhere in the bathroom or kitchen pipes.<br /><br />Steel wool + foam = pretty good idea. We may give that a shot to prevent future incidents.

				I&#039;ve got lots of gaps in my wood floors between the pieces of wood.&nbsp; Does anyone ever plug in those gaps with something?&nbsp; Right now, they just sit there and collect dust and bits of food that are hard to get out of the little gaps, but I&#039;m sure roaches have field days in there.&nbsp; Any recommendations on fixing that problem?

				You just made me&nbsp; :-) at the thought of roach field-days.....<br /><br />I&#039;m told that latex caulk would be the way to go, although it&#039;s impossible to stop the roaches considering all the possible entrances (behind cabinets, stove etc.) <br /><br />And don&#039;t forget Heloise&#039;s roach cookie dough recipe. Works for me:<br /><br />This recipe is slower to work than some insecticides, but it keeps on working for longer and is effective as long as it is kept dry. <br /><br />1/4 cup shortening or bacon<br />1/8 cup sugar<br />8 ounces powdered boric acid<br />1/2 cup flour<br />1/2 small onion, chopped (optional)<br />Enough water to form a soft dough<br /><br />Mix the shortening and sugar together. Mix together the boric acid, flour and onion, then add to the shortening-and-sugar mixture. Blend well, then add water to form a soft dough. Shape the mixture into small balls, or drop blobs into open plastic sandwich bags to keep it moist longer. Make sure you label the bags clearly so someone doesn&#039;t think you have made a tasty snack! When the dough gets hard, replace it. Place the boric-acid balls under sinks, dishwasher, refrigerator, stove and water heater, in the garage and behind outlets on your walls.<br /><br />Keep the mixture away from children and pets because it can be toxic.<br /><br />
