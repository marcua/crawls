				There are very few options - a quick drive around might be good and then just call the ones you like.

				<span style="font-family: Helvetica;" class="bbc_font"><span style="font-size: 14px;" class="bbc_size">I have a 1 bedroom available at the Pistilli building 19-19 24th Avenue.&nbsp; It is on the 6th floor directly across from Astoria Park.&nbsp; Great views of both the Triboro and Hells Gate bridge right from the balcony.&nbsp; Balcony is huge. I had almost 30 ppl out there one day for a bbq. This apartment is one of the few with no problems.&nbsp; No leaks.&nbsp; Huge balcony is great and right off the living room.&nbsp; Rent is $2,100, and a parking spot in the building is available for an extra $100.&nbsp; I&#039;m actually looking for someone to take over my lease.&nbsp; Contact me if you&#039;re interested. I can send you a photo album with pics if need be.</span></span>

				I have had the SAME leak in my Pistilli building for three years. In fact I had to wipe up the floor tonight from this rain. The skylight in my stairwell, has leaked for three years. And yes, they have known about it. My super was showing one of the main guys at the office the leak before he patched it up and painted the stairwell. A year and a half ago. <br /><br /><br />I don&#039;t know why it takes so long to get something like this fixed. I just learned tonight that the leak from the skylight has moved down to the second floor. Plaster is falling in the stairwell. <br /><br /><br />I love my apartment, so I keep fighting.....but I would recommend avoiding a Pistilli building. They are not proactive in fixing problems. <br /><br /><br />Why wouldn&#039;t a landlord fix a simple leak before the roof caves in? Pistilli will let it go on forever. I ca&#039;t understand why because it must cost them much more overall in the long run.
