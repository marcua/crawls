			Other than the new 718 on Ditmars and....around 35th??? Which has a brunch for....gulp....$21.....there is Metro on 31 St./24 Ave and a billards place on the eastern side of 21 Av and 29 St.??? Called 'Racks' Looks like a huge Sports Bar in the middle of nowhere back there. (Sorry for the lack of details on street locations...). My guess is there are far more choices on 30th ave and on Broadway if you don't mind hoping the train.
