				&nbsp;:x<br />we needed an apartment in a hurry so we looked on craigslist... we found a listing for an apt and advertised with it was a &quot;promotion&quot; saying &quot;NO FEE FOR CREDIT CHECK&quot; &amp; &quot;DISCOUNTED BROKER&#039;S FEE&quot; we called the number given and spoke to the man named TASOS. He was a real slick talking kinda guy, he had us come down that day to meet. We said hello and got into his brand new Mercedes. Beautiful, brand new, but inside it smelled like FARTS. (Later on, in his conference room, the same smell of FART took over the room, I guess this guy does alot of driving around farting on himself!!!, cuz he STINKS!!!!) So&nbsp; He drove around the block literally three minutes away to where the apt was. During the ride, he told us that as a broker, he was very flexible, and he could wait, &quot;a few weeks&quot; for his fee. We wound up liking the apartment, it wasnt anything crazy, it was just ok, but somehow he talked us into applying for it. Looking back, now, i wish we had shopped around just a bit more, we only saw one broker and one apartment, but we really didnt have the luxury of time. Tasos charged us $50 dollars EACH for two credit reports, and never thought to MENTION a discount in his broker&#039;s fee. We put a down payment on the place, paid for the credit report, and went home leaving it up to Tasos to contact the landlord and set up a meeting... <br />We met the landlord&#039;s wife who gave us the ok and signed the lease. Tasos gave her a copy. We also paid her 1600 dollars as a security deposit. Tasos told us that he would set up a meeting so that we could meet the Landlord in a day or two. He did not give us the keys, or the copy of the lease, just a receipt for the down payment, and one for the $100 dollars in credit checks. (Other broker&#039;s charged us $20 bucks for two, last year, and provided us with the paperwork, meaning our private credit information &amp; Social Security) Tasos didnt give us any of that, he kept it. Two days go by, and this guy starts calling my wife, being really condescending, getting all in our business, asking her where her out of state bank is, how they are sending the money, where is her account, etc... Not minding his own business, he keeps complaining about us not having his &quot;fee.&quot; His $1600 dollars for driving his farty Benz around the block, ONCE. He starts telling my wife &quot;well this is what you should do, have your husband go to his bank, and take out my fee and you can pay him back when your check comes from out of state. When I heard this i knew the guy had problems. First of all, the law says that he can charge a commission for procuring and obtaining the apartment for us, as of right now there is someone else living in it, yet he&#039;s harrassing my wife when Im at work talking to her like she was late in paying him. I yelled at him enough for him to back off. He started with his little attitude on the phone with me telling me &quot;thats not how it works in this office.&quot; Yeah Tasos, i hope youre reading this because now the Department Of State wants to know exactly how it does work in that office!!!<br />So the last time I saw him I put the original listing under his nose and i felt him grow uncomfortable, the way people get when you catch them in a lie, jittery, nervous a bit. He starts with his slick talking act, then explains how this was &quot;just a promotion for that one apartment.&quot; Yeah Tasos, go figure. THAT IS WHAT THEY CALL THE OLD BAIT &amp; SWITCH AND IT IS ILLEGAL IN USED CAR LOTS, AND ALSO ILLEGAL WHEN DEALING WITH OVERPRICED APARTMENTS. ITS CALLED FALSE ADVERTISING. WE WILL SEE HOW WELL TASOS DOES WHEN THE LICENSING COMMISSION GOES THROUGH HIS OLD DEALS WITH A FINE TOOTHED COMB!!!!! <br /><br />HIS REAL NAME IS ANASTASIOS MAKEDON, I WOULDNT PUT IT PAST HIM TO USE A DIFF. VARIATION OF HIS NAME EITHER.....<br /><br />TASOS FROM ASTORIA APARTMENTS ON 31ST STREET IS A LIAR AND A CROOK!!!!!!!! BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!

				Maybe you have a legitimate gripe, here not really sure, but I&#039;m guessing people would take you a little more seriously if you didn&#039;t resort to juvenile insults (and screen names). Just saying.

				While I agree that a tasteful language would have portrayed the message more maturely, the OP is clearly venting. It&#039;s not a fun situation to be in, none of us would like it very much.<br /><br />Don&#039;t let this guy go, man. Work all your powers to shut him down. It is not necessary to accept: <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=19861.msg206207.html#msg206207">Quote from: robg on November 25, 2010, 11:57:36 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">This is typical new york realty for you, enjoy. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Not all apartment transactions in Astoria are like this.
