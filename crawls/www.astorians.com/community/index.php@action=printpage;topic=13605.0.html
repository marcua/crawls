				Hello all, I&#039;m graduating in May and I&#039;m looking to move to Queens and Astoria caught my eye. I was wondering if there is any advice to be heard when apartment searching and I just wanted to know a little bit about the area. I was also wondering where I could find some good pictures of the area. From what I&#039;ve seen, it looks like just what I want. Anything is appreciated. Thanks! Ashley

				The best way to get general information about the area is to browse around the boards and do some reading. We&#039;ve all posted a lot about many different things and you can do searches to look for the kind of things you&#039;re curious about.<br /><br />Or, you can ask us all some more specific questions and we can try to help with that.<br /><br />As far as finding pictures, Google Streetview can be pretty great and you can find pictures of Astoria Park here. (http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/AstoriaPark)<br /><br />And with finding apartments, we have lots of threads in the apartment section, particularly the long sticky at the top with recommended brokers and brokers to avoid. If you&#039;re moving to the area from VA, it&#039;s probably going to be a lot easier to pay the broker&#039;s fee rather than try to get a place from out of state. <br /><br />Good luck!

				I moved here with my husband in July of last year. We came from out of state too. I must say, it&#039;s extremely difficult to find what you want for the right price at what the broker deems you can afford. I had to seriously lower my standards, but I must say that I&#039;m happy without a dishwasher &amp; washer/dryer. With the cost of electricity, trust me, you&#039;ll be happier without. Not to say you can&#039;t find apartments with these - they&#039;re out there with their own special price tag.<br /><br />Also, you may be required to have a guarantor. Although we had 40x the rent saved, the broker still wanted to see us working in NYC already. I would hear all the time, &quot;That&#039;s great you had a job in Florida, but that doesn&#039;t mean you can have the same here.&quot; Just prove them wrong. :)<br /><br />As paratactical suggested, that brokers thread is a HUGE help. There are also tons of threads regarding which areas are safe(r) in Astoria. Since you&#039;re coming from VA, I suggest you find an apartment that is close to a N/W or R/G/V stop. If you&#039;re coming with a car but don&#039;t plan on using it everyday, get a parking space the same way you got an apartment: Avoid alternate side parking and vandalism at all costs.<br /><br /><br />

				Nothing I&#039;m going to say is an absolute. There are deals worked out everywhere all the time. This new year brings a new market and I&#039;m really not sure what the pricing is like right now in Astoria. I pay more than that for a mid-sized, rent-controlled 1 bedroom in the Broadway/mid-30s area. That price doesn&#039;t eliminate you from the area, but it could restrict you from being super close to trains.

				Another question, if I&#039;m looking to move at the beginning of August, when should I actually inquire about a place? I feel like renters are anxious to get the apartments rented as soon as possible. And thanks for being so helpful!

Rentals are usually only shown if they&#039;re vacant. If you&#039;re looking for an August 1st move-in, the earliest you should start looking is June 1st, and you&#039;ll be able to see a lot more starting July 1st. You may be able to find a sublet earlier, though, if someone knows they&#039;ll be moving way in advance.

				While my experience renting elsewhere is nearly non-existent, from speaking to others it is worse in NYC than just about anywhere else in the country. Like people are flabbergasted when they realize what is really involved here. I&#039;ve found myself wondering if it&#039;s easier to adopt a human being than obtain a one year lease on a chintzy, worn-down apt where the best feature is &quot;newly painted!&quot;.<br /><br />I&#039;d say expect it to be a huge hassle, and be happy if it turns out better than expected (it is possible!)&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />And agreed on $1200 -- gonna be tough anywhere &quot;central&quot; near the train lines. Probably a few out there, but $1300-1400 is probably more realistic (or above of course -- I never have trouble finding places out of my price range). Then again, with the general direction of the economy, who knows what prices will be by summer? Maybe you&#039;ll luck out!

				Things I&#039;ve Learned that I Might be able to get Elsewhere in Apartments that I won&#039;t get (without a big price hike) in NYC:<br /><br />- Central Air/Heat<br />- Washer/Dryer in Building<br />- Dishwasher<br />- Garbage Disposal<br />- Yard<br />- Big Bathtub<br />- Walk-in Closet<br />- Parking Space Included with Apt<br /><br />The list goes on and on.<br /><br />Also, if you don&#039;t have a job lined up in NYC, you either need to have your parents sign on as guarantors or you need to sublet an apartment and save money until you get a steady job with good pay. I did the former when I came to NYC, but I wish I had done the latter. You get the benefit of having more time to find a place and you can get to know the area before you decide. Also, when you have a steady job, you can figure out if you might be able to afford more than the $1200 you&#039;re looking for now.<br /><br />$1200 is possible, but be watchful for illegal apartments (often basements) and shady landlords.

				so does all this mean that the best idea, since i cant get there more than once before we move, is to get a broker? because we&#039;re going once over spring break and depending on saved $$ we might get to go again before we move but how will i know if its an illegal apt?

I would definitely make a few (3 or more) appointments with brokers in Astoria. This site gives several broker referrals, so don&#039;t sweat that part - you&#039;re already in the right place. I didn&#039;t read about this site until after moving here. <br /><br />I came up once before moving last July. I came up the second week of June and met with a broker in Forest Hills who claimed to have the &quot;what what&quot; on Astoria. When we arrived, she had one crappy apartment to show us and then dumped us off with an Astorian broker friend. That guy was cool and showed us an apartment we fell in love with. We gave him a cash deposit and about a week before we were to move, we find out we lost that apartment because the broker got into a verbal fight with the landlord. So, one week before we were to move, we had no place to go to. Luckily, we have family up here who were able to physically walk around and view apartments for us. PLEASE - NO MATTER HOW DESPERATE YOU BECOME - DON&#039;T SIGN A LEASE WITHOUT SEEING THE APARTMENT. Sorry for the caps, but I was almost pushed to that edge.&nbsp; :evil:<br /><br />As was said, people are flabbergasted to find out just how hard it is to move to NYC. I certainly was. It&#039;s humbling, though, and gets you prepared for your strangely fabulous new surroundings.

Check out the threads 28Grand posted to get ideas of who to call. <br /><br />Even if you do get emails, March is way too far ahead for them to start keeping you in mind for an August 1 move-in date. Even June is too early. <br /><br />I know that it&#039;s scary to get ready to move up here with no idea where you&#039;re going to live. I did it, and it was very stressful. But the real estate market here is very different from everywhere else in the country--good apartments are rented within days, and brokers have dozens or even hundreds of apartment-seekers for immediate move-in at any one time. Until you are in front of them, they will not remember you.
