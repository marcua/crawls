				From today&#039;s NY Post: <br />&nbsp; City Councilman Peter Vallone (D-Queens) got that message when Council Speaker Christine Quinn slashed his annual discretionary funding -- a move widely seen as punishment for his vehement opposition to renaming the Queensboro Bridge in honor of the former mayor. <br />&nbsp;Vallone saw a 42 percent drop in district earmarks -- from more than $1.4 million last year to $838,321 in the budget that took effect last week. <br />&nbsp; By comparison, the overall discretionary budget dipped by only 2.3 percent --from $395 million to $386 million. <div style="text-align: left;"><br />Read more: http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/koch_lap_for_vallone_fguGjewmdoKPr7FVFUAgYK#ixzz1RWnyKmgM (http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/koch_lap_for_vallone_fguGjewmdoKPr7FVFUAgYK#ixzz1RWnyKmgM)</div>

				Good for Vallone for opposing the renaming of the Queensboro. Koch&#039;s name has nothing to do with that bridge and it&#039;s irritating that they slapped his name on there. Not to mention sounding ugly as hell and painfully verbose. Just... ugh. I support a lot of Christine Quinn&#039;s decision normally, but in this case she was dead wrong about the renaming of the bridge. WTF? It still bugs me today like it did when I first heard about this insanity.<br /><br /><br />The Post is not a reliable newspaper (and I&#039;m generous in using that term to describe that rag), so it wouldn&#039;t surprise me if the conjecture inside is used to stir things up. Who knows why funding was cut, but I find it regretful that Astoria is going to lose some $$$. I wonder how this will affect things around town...

				How can she be allowed to get away with something so vindictive and wrong? Punishing him and this district for not going along with bridge name, which almost everyone thought was waste of money and a dumb idea?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />Is Valone able to fight the budget slash?&nbsp; Bloomberg is damn ruthless too, he&#039;s like a dictator.&nbsp;
