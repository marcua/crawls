				Yeah, those shiny R160&#39;s are headed here!&nbsp; But not in automated-mode just yet.&nbsp; Over at the L line they&#39;re trying to go fully automated with their slightly older R143 cars.&nbsp; They had a trial run earlier in the week that didn&#39;t go too well, and were scheduled to rewire a section of track and give it a go after this weekend.<br /><br />And although www.nycsubway.org is a fabulous site, the place to go to read up on subway doings is www.subchat.com/subchat.asp (http://www.subchat.com/subchat.asp).<br /><br />- Cannibal<br />

				I was on a new train this morning (7:10am-ish? from 30th ave).&nbsp; It was so fantastic to see everyone&#39;s sleepy and yet awed faces as they entered.&nbsp; I was next to a junior high aged kid who went 4 stops before realizing he was on a new train and looked up at the digital map while muttering &quot;holy sh --------t.....&quot;&nbsp; adorable. <br />I do wish, though, that some surly/disturbingly happy mta conductor was announcing.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				<em>I do wish, though, that some surly/disturbingly happy mta conductor was announcing. </em> <br /><br />Be careful what you wish for, neighbor! And trust me on this one, on a Monday morning when you&#39;re a bit late and sleep-deprived, this joker begs for a serious ass-kicking.<br /><br />On the flip side, anybody catch that vintage subway car parked at Astoria Blvd. for the 100th anniversary of the MTA, or whatever the occasion was? It was a functioning replica, complete with old ads (similar to modern ads!), wicker seats, bell and conductor. <br /><br />Unfortunately it was running back-and-forth to just one other local stop for a couple of hours, and I was headed to work. But I got to watch it pull away and hear the bell, it was beyond charming!&nbsp; 8-)

				Forgot to post that I got to ride the shiny new N train back home from Union Square on Wednesday. It was great! Much smoother ride, and&nbsp; overall a generally better experience than our other trains. Still love the old N train seats better, but a smoother ride can&#39;t be beat!

				somehow or other I&#39;ve managed to be on a&nbsp; new train 3 times in one week. go figure. they&#39;re pretty awesome, except that now when my parents come to visit I can&#39;t lie to them about how many stops we have to go.<br /><br />I also love the guy who says &quot;...in the borough of...&quot;.&nbsp; it sounds like a 1940s radio show.&nbsp; I also really enjoy the tour-guide announcer.&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;this is 59th street and lexington avenue! bloomingdales is right upstairs!&quot;.&nbsp; It is always 6am when I hear him and no matter how cranky I am that always amuses me.<br />I suspect he&#39;d rattle off the features of the new train in between stops.&nbsp; and that would be sweet exactly one time.

				All MTA subways and buses have a listed schedule (http://www.mta.info/nyct/service/subsch.htm).&nbsp; Of course, whether they actually run <em>on</em> that schedule is another matter entirely.&nbsp; That said, because Ditmars is the N/W terminus, it&#39;s relatively accurate if you&#39;re getting on there.&nbsp; I occasionally check it out if it is imperative that I be somewhere at a specific time, especially on the weekend when the trains run less frequently.

				I was on the platform glaring at the Express as it bypassed Broadway, all of us standing in the rain.&nbsp; What makes them determine when to run an express?&nbsp; I know it&#39;s great for folks further up the line, but it really bites for anyone at 30th Avenue or further South.&nbsp; It gets so old to see five trains go up towards Ditmars, and have the platform fill up, especially in the rain, and then to get back on schedule they run expresses.

				I once overheard some MTA workers explaining why the trains sometimes run express from Astoria Blvd to Queensborough plaza, and it is basically done when they are running behind schedule.&nbsp; I know when I lived off of the 30th stop, I thought they were being dicks, and when I moved to Ditmars area I thought they were being cool, but overall its just the way for them to catch up.&nbsp; I see other lines in the city do it every now and then, like the F.&nbsp;

				Yeah, it just seems to be when there&#39;s a big delay between trains. Usually when the N goes express, there&#39;s another N or W not far behind. Even though it just adds insult to injury for all the people waiting between Astoria Blvd and Queensboro to watch a train finally arrive and then just keep going, ultimately it&#39;s better because it helps to get them back on schedule. It makes more sense to do than than to have everyone down the N line, through all three boroughs, waiting 25 minutes for a train, and then an N and W come really close together.

				They are definitely running more new trains now.&nbsp; They must have gotten a new shippment recently.&nbsp; I have been seeing them with fairly regular frequency this past week.

				Speaking of new-fangled subway, technology check this out:<br /><br />http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2007/01/13/l_train_riders.php (http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2007/01/13/l_train_riders.php)<br /><br />They&#39;ve started testing real-time train-arrival displays on the L line!

				The other night I was on one and when we arrived at Queensboro Plaza there was an announcement that it would be running express and the next stop was Hoyt Avenue. Nobody knew what Hoyt Avenue was, so almost everyone got off. After waiting outside in the cold, the next train arrived and was absolutely packed. The whole experience was pretty ridiculous and annoying.&nbsp; :x

				It looks nice and sleek and spiffy, very much like the recent trains added to the 4 line. However, there are less seats, and the poles are at somewhat more awkward positions for standing commuters to hold on to.
