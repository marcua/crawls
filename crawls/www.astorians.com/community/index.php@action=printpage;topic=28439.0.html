				has anyone ever gotten anything decent to eat here?&nbsp; Each time I&#039;ve gone, I think &quot;this sandwich really sucks, how is this place always so crowded&quot;?<br /><br />Maybe it&#039;s more or a bar and less of a restaurant?&nbsp; At least that&#039;s the impression I get.<br />

				There is a roasted chicken sandwich (pressed, I believe) that has corn in it -- and I&#039;ve gotten that several times and enjoyed it. I&#039;ve tried a couple other sandwiches and enjoyed those (brisket maybe?), but don&#039;t get food from here much anymore. And definitely don&#039;t dine there because I assume it&#039;s more of a bar than restaurant (e.g. somewhere I can take my kid). There are a few places in Astoria like that which sort of baffle me -- like that new hot dog place on 30th ave. Food that is very kid-friendly, yet it&#039;s more of a bar in presentation so I would never take my kid.<br /><br /><br />I understand a lot of people like this, though, and don&#039;t like kids in restaurants. But I sure do appreciate places (e.g. Bareburger, Beer Garden) that serve booze and appeal to adults while still feeling very family-oriented. I am very curious how the new expanded Butcher Bar space might fill this niche too (will it serve booze now too?).

				I am also not impressed by the food, I think it&#039;s like a 6/10, but the Happy Hour is great and and they have some good drinks! I feel it&#039;s nice place to have in the area and not too overpriced

				No, it&#039;s more about not being a snob to people and assuming that they know something, which actually excludes people if you act high and mighty for you knowing and not them. <br /><br /><br />Astoria is a large place, and it&#039;s ridiculous to think that everyone knows every place. If you want to actually treat this as a community and be friendly to people, you would have included some sort of info with your first post (even a tiny &quot;the place on Ditmars&quot;), or you could have linked to Yelp instead of your rude LMGTFY. <br /><br /><br />All I was doing was calling you out on it. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				I actually couldn&#039;t care less whether the info itself was posted, but my point is that using &quot;LMGTFY&quot; is just a bit snotty and rude.
