				My nanny (and extended family member), Jaso, is looking to move into<br />housecleaning now that our youngest child is in nursery school. I<br />highly recommend her: she is hardworking, very thorough and, most<br />importantly, completely trustworthy. She has references not just from<br />me but others she has cleaned for.<br /><br />Currently she has two houses in Manhattan that she cleans every two<br />weeks for $100+tip each time. She would like to have a house to clean<br />every weekday, and she knows the Astoria rate would be cheaper, but<br />then she would not have to commute.<br /><br />If you are interested, please respond to me by email and I will forward<br />her contact information.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Sylvia<br /><br />

				She does an incredibly thorough job--cleaning refrigerators, ovens, laundry, etc, so she has a 4 hour minimum and she commits to one house per day.&nbsp; She also does post constuction and apartment turnover cleaning.<br /><br />For the Astoria neighborhood, she is willing to clean once a week for $75 vs once every two weeks for $100, no tip expected. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I had the pleasure of having Jaso clean my apt for the first time today. She truly is wonderful and did an excellent job cleaning up my 3 br, which was in bad shape. I don&#039;t think $75 for a 3 br is a lot of money for this area at all. Prior to using Jaso, I used several other Polish cleaners, who got the same amt of $, and were not nearly as thorough or pleasant as Jaso.

				I think $75 per week is very high - but for a 3br that was in bad shape, that&#039;s pretty reasonable.&nbsp; I have a small 1br that is tidy, so I&#039;d hate to have to pay the same rate.

				I would also like to vouch for Jaso. She cleaned our house last week (1 bedroom with an office + 2 bathrooms) and did an incredible job - it was very thorough. She also did our laundry to perfection. She was extremely personable and I felt very comfortable with her right away. I hope to have her cleaning for us for many years to come here in Astoria and getting to know her in the process. She seems so far like a wonderful person who truly gives 100% to her efforts. Highly recommend!

				I met Jaso three weeks ago.&nbsp; <br />The first day she came and did not stop cleaning until she left my three bedroom apartment the cleanest it has been in years, what a treat to have somebody help you with cleaning and have your apartment smelling fresh and dust free!<br />The next time she came to help me care for my 6 month old baby while I got some office work done, since he has become very demanding for attention.&nbsp; He just loved her and had the time of his life with her singing to him and playing and giving him all the attention he craved.&nbsp; She just comes across as a very sweet, caring, and good person with whom I felt very comfortable being around.<br />She will continue to help me once a week with both cleaning and assisting me with the baby so I can get some work done around the house without feeling like I am neglecting my little one.&nbsp; <br />I just have to say that in three weeks she has certainly made a big impact in our quality of life.&nbsp; <br />If you want to contact her, her number is [removed by moderator]<br /><br />Marcela

				Jaso did a FANTASTIC job on our 1-bedroom apartment. I had thought that I was a pretty clean, neat person - I vacuum, I mop, I wipe down countertops and the oven with some regularity. That&#039;s why I was shocked that she spent all day cleaning my apartment, and I was absolutely amazed at the difference! She got to our place at 9am and didn&#039;t leave until 4:30pm. Everything sparkled like it did when we moved in. Truly could not believe what a fantastic, thorough job she did, and all with a wonderful attitude. I&#039;ll be using her services regularly!

She does not use or understand the internet, so I have tried to use it for her to get new clients, and it has been very successful. I posted about Jaso on a few sites, including Astorians.com, as well as Craig&#039;s list and other local sites.&nbsp; As she has cleaned for each household, I have asked each client (including Merm) to post about their experience on this site so that those viewing the thread would see that it&#039;s not just me saying she&#039;s great, esp as this was the only site that seemed to think her rates were high, and I tried to get across just how hard she works for her $75 day&#039;s wage.&nbsp; <br /><br />So blame me for the single posts, as these are not regular Astorians.com post-ers but just people trying to help out someone who works very hard and reassure people that Jaso is well worth the money.&nbsp; Most of those who have had Jaso clean for them have come from other Astoria parents&#039; sites and are new to Astorians.com, and I&#039;m glad to tell them about this site because I (usually) find it very welcoming and a good resource for what&#039;s going on in the neighborhood.<br /><br />But I promise, nothing &quot;shady&quot; is going on here.&nbsp; These are all real people who have had Jaso clean for them, and these are their own words.&nbsp; I have met some of them, like merm, and others I have not.&nbsp; But all of them have liked her work.&nbsp; And honestly, I wonder how many of those who find her rates high would work for $75 a day, on their knees, scrubbing someone else&#039;s floors.

				Me too!<br /><br />Based on everyone&#039;s glowing recommendations, I hired Jaso to clean my 1br apartment today. I can verify that she is as great as everyone says! She did an excellent and very thorough job, and the apartment looks fabulous. She and I decided on a regular once-a-month cleaning schedule, which is going to be a big help for us.

				I&#039;ve been very happy with Jaso, but wanted to clarify that the original posts from Sylvia are misleading.&nbsp; She charges 75 for up to 5 hours, not for an unlimited amount.&nbsp; However, I don&#039;t consider it unreasonable, since my place is 4 bedroom/1 bath.<br />

				Sorry, didn&#039;t mean to be misleading, $75 is not a fee for unlimited cleaning, I meant it as the minimum amount, because she will go as long as she is physically able in a day to get a house clean, as she only cleans one house a day.&nbsp; There has been only one house that she just was not able to complete in a day. <br /><br />If the job takes her more than one 6 hour day of hard full-time cleaning (because I think everyone that has had her clean sees that she is cleaning for every minute that she&#039;s there) and she needs to return on another day to finish, then it seems only fair that it would be an additional fee, as it is additional work. <br /><br />If you have a large house, or multiple pets and children, the best idea may be for her to come see the place first and let you know if she thinks it&#039;s going to take longer than one day, so that you both have an idea of what&#039;s expected.<br /><br />Sorry for any miscommunication!<br /><br />Sylvia

				Thanks for the good words about Jaso.&nbsp; I think she is well worth it and she does her very best.&nbsp; I think where we ran into trouble on your house is that I was not aware nor was Jaso aware when she booked your job just what a large house you had and that there were pets and four children.&nbsp; That was our mistake, and I know Jaso is very shy, so I imagine that she just got to work, without bringing it up at the beginning of the day that the job was much bigger than she expected and that she didn&#039;t think she could finish it in a day.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just wanted to respond to your note<br /><br />&quot;If the job takes her more than one 6 hour day&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Other than being 5 hours, instead of 6, I would agree completely.&quot;<br /><br />Just want to clear up the hourly misconception, if you read my first post, I said she charges $75 for a 4 hour minimum, not for 6 hours.&nbsp; I said that often she will clean up to 6 hours for that amount, and that&#039;s why we said there was a 4 hour minimum, because it&#039;s almost impossible for her to stop in the middle.&nbsp; Most people vastly underestimate the time it takes for someone to really do a thorough cleaning, and I think you will agree that Jaso was going for the whole time, so we had to come up with a minimum amount.<br /><br />So, to be clear, $75 is the minimum amount for 4 hours.&nbsp; She often works past that on her own time just to get the job done to her level of professionalism, but that is at her discretion, and so I should just be clear to say that $75 is for 4 hours and that&#039;s what you should expect.&nbsp; If she goes over that time, she is doing it as a favor.&nbsp; <br /><br />Again, I&#039;m glad that you&#039;ve had positive experience with Jaso, and we certainly didn&#039;t mean to mislead you.&nbsp; I just wanted to emphasize to anyone that 1) the minimum is $75, for 4 hours, even if your apartment is very small, because she will take at least that amount of time to clean for you (and most professional agencies will charge close to double that for the same time and will not come to clean for less than a 4 hr min) and that 2) the $75 it is not for an unlimited amount of time.<br /><br />Also, she does an excellent job on laundry.&nbsp; Jaso will wash, dry, fold/or hang dry up to 2 laundry bags of laundry (the amount that she can handle up and down stairs) for an additional $25, if you provide access to the laundromat (either in your building or a building key to get back in your bldg) a roll of quarters (she is scrupilous about the quarters and will return all change to you) and the soap/fabric softener, and hangers or a drying rack for any clothes you designate as hang dry only.&nbsp; She will leave the clean clothes folded or hanging where you designate, because she never goes into drawers unless you specifically tell her to.

I was under the impression that she would only work up to 5 hours.&nbsp; We also discussed a higher flat rate for the whole house or an hourly rate beyond the 75 dollar/five hour base price.&nbsp; She told me that she needed to discuss rates with you before deciding and I was waiting to hear back from her about that.&nbsp; While I don&#039;t mind her splitting the house up into two days, her schedule is very busy and she doesn&#039;t always have that much time for me.&nbsp; It would be easier for me to get it all done in one day, too.<br /><br />Jaso is incredibly thorough.&nbsp; She&#039;s very much a self starter -- she doesn&#039;t need to be given a to do list but sees what needs to be done and just does it.&nbsp; The only &quot;problem&quot; I&#039;ve run into (and I&#039;m putting it in quotes because it&#039;s usually a good thing) is that she and I have different levels of tolerance for mess, so she often spends time on things that I don&#039;t think need quite as much attention, but I&#039;m sure she&#039;s probably right about them needing to be done. :)<br /><br />BTW -- when are you due w/ you baby?&nbsp; I looooove babies!!!&nbsp; New babies are so exciting!

				Thanks for your note about our baby, we are completely shocked and surprised and finally, thrilled.<br /><br />I&#039;ve PMd you about the other stuff, once again, I&#039;m very sorry for any misunderstandings and can completely understand if you decide to go with someone else.&nbsp; As I mentioned in another post, there is another cleaning lady listed on this post and maybe she could give you a better rate.&nbsp; I appreciate how honest and supportive you&#039;ve been of Jaso even if the experience wasn&#039;t what you expected.<br /><br />Thanks again,<br /><br />Sylvia
