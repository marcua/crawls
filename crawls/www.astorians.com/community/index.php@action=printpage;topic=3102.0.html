				And the &quot;funny&quot; thing is that as far as animal cruelty goes, foie gras isn&#39;t nearly as bad as what they do in industrial chicken farms. The ducks fed for foie gras tend to be fairly free-range for all but the force-feeding phase of their life, and ducks don&#39;t have a gag reflex so putting a tube down their throat isn&#39;t all that cruel. In contrast, most chickens spend their entire lives in a cage the size of a sheet of paper in a huge barn that reeks of ammonia, and have their beaks snipped. I&#39;d rather be a foie gras duck than a McNugget chicken any day of the week...<br /><br />Here&#39;s what one chef who spent some time force-feeding ducks had to say about it. (http://www.megnut.com/2006/08/foie-one-chefs-response) And here&#39;s another take, with some photos.<br />&nbsp;(http://drvino.blogspot.com/2006/08/goose-gitmo.html)<br />

				Yeah, the whole force-feeding thing sounds a lot worse than it is.&nbsp; While it may be somewhat uncomfortable, it&#39;s not as though birds <em>ever</em> chew and swallow--all that work is done internals through the gizzard.<br /><br />As far as humane foods go, I&#39;d say beef is probably the best thing you can eat.&nbsp; I spent some time on a cattle ranch in Oklahoma last year and the whole operation was very pleasant.&nbsp; Cows just naturally require so much square footage that it makes cruelty fairly impossible.&nbsp; Chicken and pigs, not so much.&nbsp; :|

				Hmmm. Interesting articles. I&#39;ve always thought that foie gras was very cruel - if admittedly a small part of animal cruelty as a whole. Not sure that I&#39;m totally convinved otherwise, but something to think about.

				the reason i avoid beef for the most part is&nbsp; because of what I have seen for all the years that i would commute the seven hour drive between LA and Santa Cruz...<br /><br />There&#39;s this huge industrial cattle ranch just off the interstate 5 somewhere between the junction with the 99 and Los Banos (yes people, there is a town called &quot;the bathrooms&quot; in california but that&#39;s off topic)<br />the stink is to high heaven, the cows just look off color and well i&#39;ve spotted dead carcasses too. no way i&#39;m eatin&#39; that sh*t.<br /><br />besides, cows consume the largest amount of grain on the planet and that again is a whole separate thread.

Cow and calf farm.&nbsp; Cows are inseminated, adolescent calves are sold at auction.<br />2. Grow up on a second farm, sold at about 600 lbs.<br />3. Eat eat eat at the feedlot, sold at about 1000 lbs.<br />4. Slaughterhouse.<br /><br />It&#39;s my understanding that cows are normally stunned and have their necks broken before they are slaughtered.&nbsp; Not altogether pleasant, but could be worse.<br /><br />I&#39;d say the people who do the meat-packing are treated more in-humanely than the cattle.
