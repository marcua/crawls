				We had another ridiculously pleasurable experience tonight eating at Hellgate on the Park.&nbsp; Perfect night tonight, delicious eggplant parmagiana, glass of red wine, and the jukebox ringing out with some of my favorite Sinatra hits.<br /><br />How many restaurants in this country, from sea to shining sea, strain painfully to try to duplicate this experience, and fail miserably?&nbsp; I left with a strong feeling that this is only for now, we&#039;re lucky to have a place like this happening now.&nbsp; It&#039;s the kind of place that people wish was still open.

				I recommend the outdoor seating in the back patio, which is quieter, although the front sidewalk seating does offer the view of the neighborhood as it bustles at night in the summer around that area.

				Sorry to hear that!&nbsp; H-o-t-P is a very unique place, with food unusually dependent on the touch of one specific individual, their chef Emilio.&nbsp; If he needs the night off, or can&#039;t be there, they don&#039;t have a &quot;second-string&quot; cook they try to replace him with.&nbsp; Hope you get back there and get to try it.

				First time I&#039;ve ever heard of them not being open, serving food, during their regularly scheduled hours.&nbsp; I guess it couldn&#039;t hurt to call in advance just to be sure though: (718) 204-0023.&nbsp;

				Aha. Yeah, we were there once for drinks, but didn&#039;t care for the noise. Went back last night for dinner, and the kitchen was closed (it is open for food Wed-Sat.)<br /><br />But the guy (owner?) sitting outside was very friendly, so we&#039;ll go back and try the food.<br /><br />Ended up going to Bistro 33 instead- not happy with the portions ($12 for a few thin slices of &quot;new-style sashimi&quot; was an insult IMO) but it is creative. Better choice for drinks and/or a light meal in a comfy, upscale atmosphere; don&#039;t go with a huge appetite!

				Finally got around to eating there tonight, truly wonderful!&nbsp; :mrgreen:&nbsp; :mrgreen: If you want fancy-shmancy, fuggedabawdit.... hell, if you want bread or lasagna, you might be out of luck too (they ran out tonight due to unexpected extra people- no big deal.) <br /><br />I don&#039;t like eating meat, but they make a meatball even I could hardly resist. And the eggplant parm didn&#039;t weigh me down like it does in most places. Penne a la vodka was also really nice- not that I&#039;m an expert. <br /><br />Melanie the waitress did a fine job considering she was running the bar as well. Which one is Emilio? Bald guy? Crowd is so friendly we can&#039;t even tell who&#039;s working there and who&#039;s just a regular.

				Bald guy is Andrew, the owner.&nbsp; Emilio is on the short side with grey hair and rarely leaves the kitchen.&nbsp; Melanie is a pretty hard worker.&nbsp; Often the only one tending bar and waiting tables.&nbsp; It&#039;s a great place.&nbsp; Emilio&#039;s cooking is delicious.&nbsp; It&#039;s the perfect place to go if you want to just relax and take it slow.&nbsp; Doesn&#039;t matter how you&#039;re dressed or what time it is.&nbsp; I admit, we&#039;d go more often if Emilio worked on Sunday.&nbsp; But he needs a break.

				Haven&#039;t been here in about 2 years.&nbsp; Went for dinner last Thursday around 6:30pm.&nbsp; We were the first ones in the restaurant area but the bar was pretty busy.&nbsp; The bartender (Alice i think) came over and said &quot;pick a table&quot;...we sat, she gave us menus, cut some fresh bread &amp; took our drink orders. We were 3 adults, 2 kids (11 and 15) <br /><br />We took a look at the menu.&nbsp; It&#039;s your basic Italian entrees with 3 appetizers (2 salads and shrimp cocktail)&nbsp; The kids skipped apps but the adults wanted salad, she suggested getting a family style salad for the table which was a great.&nbsp; I ordered the eggplant parm with a side of meatballs, the others had chicken parm and linguine with white clam sauce.&nbsp; My eggplant was amazing. The others raved about their meals as well.&nbsp; The salad was great too, classic garden salad with fresh mozzarella, balsamic &amp; oil...nothing fancy but very fresh.&nbsp; The whole vibe is very casual, red/white checkered table cloths, very laid back.&nbsp; When our entrees arrived the restaurant area started filling up.&nbsp; I did notice that a table across the way had ordered Fried Calamari which was not on the menu for appetizer.&nbsp; Would have been nice to know if that was an option but no big deal, maybe next time.&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />Our waitress/bartender was great, friendly &amp; energetic...a really nice lady. Overall we had a delicious inexpensive dinner.&nbsp; I&#039;ll be going back very soon.
