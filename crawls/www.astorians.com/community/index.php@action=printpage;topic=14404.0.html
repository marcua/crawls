				Anyone interested in playing tennis this season...? The season starts April 4th and goes through November. Just looking for someone who&#039;s also wanting to play, nothing super competitive.<br /><br />

				Not sure of the court is open. I still need to get&nbsp; my permit for the season. I was holding off because I wasn&#039;t sure if I could find anyone to play with. Any luck getting a network of people together? Otherwise I&#039;m still game.

				I completely forgot about the permit! Last year I was taking a few lesssons, got to know the guys and never needed to get one. I&#039;ll probably stop by there this weekend and see about squaring that away.<br /><br />So far, I found three people, whom I haven&#039;t met yet, that are interested. Ideally, we&#039;ll have enough people whereby anyone can always find someone close to their skill level to make sure everyone has fun. Any thoughts on how to get word out?

				Thanks. I just found that site, and this site for that matter, a few weeks ago. I&#039;ll definitely do that. I was thinking about putting up a few color fliers too, which may be a little old school. Maybe I&#039;ll start the meet up group on WLA and put that info on the fliers as well. So you&#039;re interested too? If so, that&#039;s great! I would love to ultimately have a network of 20+ players, b/c there&#039;s a lot of people out there that would like to play, but don&#039;t have a partner..<br /><br />

				Update!&nbsp; Just went to the tennis courts and you DONT need a permit for the next two weeks or so..&nbsp; If you don&#039;t have a permit, enjoy the grace period.. <br /><br /><strong>If anyone needs a permit or has questions, just call (718) 393-7272</strong><br /><br />See you on the courts!

				This is great news. I played a lot a couple years ago, but since I&#039;ve moved to New York last summer I didn&#039;t play a whole lot because of a lack of partners. So I&#039;m going to join, I&#039;m really looking to get back into things!
