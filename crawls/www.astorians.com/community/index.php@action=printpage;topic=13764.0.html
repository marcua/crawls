				<br /><b>Dear Demetrios Poulakas</b><br /><br />There is much to celebrate George W. Bush leaves the White House.&nbsp; In addition, <br />Congressman Nadler, Chairman of the Subcommittee on the Constitution, recently <br />introduced a resolution expressing staunch opposition to any potential <br />preemptive pardons of members of his Administration and the need for an <br />Independent commission or select committee to investigate, and, where <br />appropriate, prosecute illegal acts by senior officials of the administration of <br />President George W. Bush. <br /><br />I fully support this resolution and I have signed on as a co-sponsor.<br /><br />The issue of preemptive and/or blanket pardons has been a subject of much debate and <br />frustration. There is great concern that Bush will abuse his pardon power and <br />further cover up wrongdoing by his Administration.<br /><br />However, as citizens, we have a responsibility to reject any abuse of <br />the presidential pardon power to shield or manipulate investigations.<br /><br />Regardless of the legality of potential pardons, there needs to be a full <br />accounting of this Administration&#039;s abuses.&amp;nbsp; No doubt many of the players in the <br />Administration will seek future positions or public office.&nbsp; The public deserves <br />a full accounting of what they have done, and the law, in my opinion, requires <br />it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Many felt that President-elect Obama&#039;s victory might free members of Congress to move <br />forward with Impeachment Hearings.&amp;nbsp; However, the weeks since the election have <br />been largely consumed with trying to formulate a balanced and thoughtful <br />response to the economic crisis, which, no doubt, is affecting many of you. <br /><br />The struggles of the American auto industry, and the ongoing banking and credit <br />crisis, skyrocketing unemployment, and our exploding budget deficit have taken <br />center stage. <br /><br />Some of our most critical issues - universal health care, Medicare and <br />social security funding, alternative energy investment, and education <br />improvements are all threatened by this crisis.<br /><br />Although I am committed as ever to holding this Administration accountable, we are facing a <br />historic crisis in this nation that Congress and President-elect Obama must work <br />together to solve.&nbsp; Obama&#039;s victory gives us a window to accomplish vital tasks that will<br />have very direct impact on you and your family.<br /><br />I thoroughly believe that President-elect Obama will return us to a <br />government that respects the rights of its citizens and the rule of law.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt; <br />I look forward to working closely with his Administration to not only repair the <br />damage, but bring forth a renewed sense that government is, in fact, responsible <br />and answerable to the people. <br /><br />With great respect and admiration,<br /><br />Robert Wexler<br /><br /><b>Liberty Project III (http://www.thecauses.org)</b><br /><br /><br />LP III 1978-2009: www.thecauses.org<br /><br />+JVA+
