				Hello Everyone,<br />&nbsp;<br />We&#039;re launching our <em><strong>FUN FITNESS Summer Program (June - August)</strong></em>. Our goal is for you to have fun and to learn new skills, while working out and sweating those pounds off or just toning up. Just ask yourself a few questions...<br /><br />- Are you looking to get in (better) shape this summer?<br />- Do you want to have loads of fun while doing it?<br />- Do you want to learn a new activity/skill at the same time?<br />- AND are you looking to do that without spending a lot?<br />&nbsp;<br />yes? yes? yes? yes?<br />Plenty more information and discounts detailed on our website :<br /><strong>http://www.mkdkarate.com/fun-fitness-summer-2009.html</strong><br />&nbsp;<br />You can sign up for one or more classes. Prices are ridiculous... Pick your time and your activity.<br />&nbsp;<br />CHILDREN - Sign up your children for karate at $160 for 3 months...<br />ADULTS - Sign yourself up for a variety of classes -- Light cardio &amp; flexibility, Karate-Kickboxing, and Self-Defense Fitness for the same crazy price :-)<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Here&#039;s the schedule: <br /><span class="bbc_u">SATURDAYS</span> </strong> <br /><strong>9am - 10am: Light cardio &amp; Flexibility</strong><br />Come start your day with some light cardio that will warm up all your muscles and get your blood moving. Stretching and flexibility will loosen your tight spots and oil up your joints. If you want to ease into a workout or are just beginning to work out your body, this is the class for you. You can experience the class as intense or easy as you make it. The end result for sure, is that you will be left feeling energized and ready to tackle your day!<br /><br /><strong>10am - 11am: Children&#039;s Karate</strong><br />Children learn karate techniques (punches, kicks, blocks, katas) in a fun yet disciplined atmosphere. Children learn to be assertive, while also recognizing figures of authority (which translates to parents, teachers, etc.) Conditioning customized for children, is also part of the class. Classes are a formal style. Uniform is required ($20). <br /><br /><strong>11am - 12pm: Karate-Kickboxing</strong><br />This Karate-Kickboxing class is well-rounded and encompasses Karate, Kickboxing and Self-Defense. It is a great workout and you learn kicking and punching, as you would in a kickboxing class. Conditioning is part of the class and the student does as much as they can, with the encouragement of Sensei Orlando, and they build stamina class by class. You will work out a good sweat!<br /><br /><strong>12pm - 1pm: Self Defense Fitness</strong><br />This class is one of its kind. Get your workout while learning, working on and practicing your Self-Defense moves. It&#039;s not just enough to know &quot;techniques&quot;. You need to train your body so that it instinctively applies those techniques in moments and situations of danger.&nbsp; With this training, you speed up your reflexes, hone your self-defense techniques and strengthen your mind, body and spirit.<br /><br /><strong><span class="bbc_u">SUNDAYS</span></strong><br /><br /><strong>10am - 11am: Light cardio &amp; Flexibility</strong><br />Come start your day with some light cardio that will warm up all your muscles and get your blood moving.
