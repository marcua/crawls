				Every night coming home from work the train stops some where between 36th Ave and Astoria Blvd at least once (usually twice) for anywhere between 5 and 15 minutes. Last Friday might have been pushing 20 minutes actually. They say it&#39;s train traffic ahead, ok fine, but every night for the past 2 weeks? <br /><br /><br />BTW, this happens sometime between 6 and 6:30. :x

				I&#39;ve had delays in both directions - morning and evening.&nbsp; It does seem to be getting worse on the N/W line.&nbsp; The first train that came to my station this morning was so packed, people couldn&#39;t even get in, then they said it had door issues at Queensborough Plaza which kept us waiting at each and every station in Queens.

				Weird. Speaking of the morning train...I get on at Ditmars. The past 2 days it&#39;s been Ditmars, Astoria Blvd, then direct to QBP (Once on the N once on the W). Now I can&#39;t complain because I work all the way downtown (2 stops from Brooklyn) and this speeds up my trip, but I thought the N/W was local in Queens. So is this normal?

				I&#39;ve been noticing lately that the trains are extremely slow from about Broadway all the way to Ditmars if I leave work between 5:30 and 7:00.&nbsp; They always say it&#39;s because of trains in the station at Ditmars -- so what has happened that is suddenly causing the trains to pile up at Ditmars?&nbsp; Did they change the schedule lately?&nbsp; Did they put a new person into some kind of supervisory role somewhere on the line?&nbsp; It happened again tonight, and as we sat at Broadway with the doors open and the frigid air pouring in, I started to wonder what was going on, but I caught myself.&nbsp; &quot;Oh yeah, I left work at a normal time tonight, and it&#39;s happening again,&quot; I said to myself.&nbsp; I was talking with a friend tonight who said she was noticing it, too. <br /><br />Just saw your new post, Tommy -- no, it&#39;s not normal for the N or W to run express in Queens.&nbsp; When they introduced the W in July 2001, it was supposed to be an express train in Queens, and for the six weeks it lasted, it was sweet.&nbsp; But in the chaos after September 11, they made the W a local - initially, they said it was temporary because the N was suspended briefly.&nbsp; But they never made it back into a Queens express.&nbsp; The W was actually only supposed to be a temporary train until some track work was finished in 2004, but that plan seems to have changed as well.

				Yup, I was on that train too.&nbsp; It&#39;s happened to me Monday, Wednesday and Friday now.&nbsp; I think I have a black cloud of lateness following me, because every time I wait for the train, it takes 20 minutes to arrive in 49th Station, and then it&#39;s packed all the way to Ditmars.&nbsp; What&#39;s going on?&nbsp; Does that number Jtrane called for the MTA have an email option?&nbsp; I don&#39;t have much time for phone calls at work.

				Last night was lousy.&nbsp; By 8:30, the W had stopped running (which I thought didn&#39;t happen until 9), and then I waited 20 minutes at Times Square for an N, after 2 Rs and 2 Qs passed through.&nbsp; Then of course the @$% train went express from QBP to Astoria Boulevard; fortunately, there really was a local train right behind it.<br /><br />Today was the 2nd morning in a row I had a W pass me at Broadway, going express.&nbsp; What gives?&nbsp; Surely all the tracks are cleared off by now.

				Last night was just bizarre. I was coming home from work on the W train around 6-6:15, and we pull into Broadway. The announcer comes on and says, &quot;Yeah, so you may want to get off and walk because I&#39;m looking ahead and I&#39;m seeing congestion and I have no idea when we&#39;ll be moving.&quot; A few minutes later he comes on again, &quot;You may want to walk home cause, I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m thinking like we&#39;ll be stuck here for 30 minutes, maybe 45.&quot; Totally unprofessional (you had to hear his voice), and we didn&#39;t sit there for half an hour - we sat there for maybe 10 minutes.<br /><br />I mean the guy was kind of funny because of the way he was talking, but at the same time, I don&#39;t want my MTA personnel saying, &quot;Yeah, I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t even know when we&#39;re leaving. You should walk. If I were you I&#39;d walk.&quot; What&#39;s totally sad is that a bunch of people took his advice and I bet I got home before much of them. :(

				It was mostly cleared up at around 6:45 when I got on the train to go home, but then the N train I was on had door trouble at 34th St, and sat for 10 minutes while they fixed it. (Which they did.) But they didn&#39;t allow us to get off the train to catch the W across the platform! How annoying. And then it was backed up a bit getting into Ditmars, probably backlog from the earlier troubles... Took me about 15 minutes longer than normal, which is not all that bad, but still annoying when I get to get to a Dr&#39;s appointment... (Which was delayed longer than the train was, a topic for a different rants thread...!)<br /><br />I don&#39;t know whether the recent problems have to do with the weather or not. I haven&#39;t heard anything about snow or ice causing problems. There was that broken track in the tunnel earlier in the week due in part to the cold, but aside from that, it sounds like maintenance issues are the larger cause of delays...<br />

				Tonight I was on my way to Jtrane&#039;s gig and the train stopped just short of Astoria Blvd. We sat there for a long time, and finally the operator announced that the signal was out at Ditmars and there was no telling when they would get it fixed. He pulled the train up so that the first car was in the station (the last car of the previous train was still in the station too) and they unlocked the doors between the cars so we could all walk through to the first car and get off the damn train.<br /><br />It was an annoying situation (and WTF do they have signal problems EVERY TIME IT RAINS? Can&#039;t someone do a little analysis and figure out what they need to do to fix it?) but I appreciated them letting us off!

I know there is this &quot;schedule&quot; that the MTA attempts to keep, but if you&#039;ve got trains backed up the line, why the hell don&#039;t the trains leave Ditmars?

				Another great evening on the W train...<br /><br />Got on at City Hall station around 5:30ish. No problems until we get to 57th Street, at which point the train sits in the station and the conductor announces, &quot;Because of smoke in the tunnel, all N, R &amp; W trains to Queens are delayed. We hope to be moving momentarily.&quot; Meanwhile, at the same time, another announcement is being made in the station: &quot;Because of an investigation at Lexington Ave, all Brooklyn bound N, R &amp; W trains are only running from 5th Ave &amp; below. We suggest that all passengers trying to get to Queens take the local downtown train to 42nd and switch to a Queens bound 7.&quot; I left &amp; took a cab.<br /><br />Aarrrrrrrrrrrrrgh! I love you, Astoria...but the MTA is really trying to push me out!&nbsp; :cry:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				I was Union Square about 5:30 as well - and the station was announcing that we had to take the 7 to get back out here, when an N train turned up. I thought &#039;what the hell&#039; and jumped on. Well they announced delays due to &#039;smoke&#039; at Lex (Union Sqare had said &#039;investigation&#039;) but kept right on running anyway. Some small delays. But I was at Astoria Blvd by 6:30, which is only about 15mins longer than my normal commute. Better than rushing to the 7, dealing with the crowds, and then piling back on at Queensborough. Plus, Lex looked pretty normal. So who knows what was going on?? <br /><br />

				I got on the N at 5:30 at 49th and it stayed put between stations.&nbsp; Finally it arrived to 57th and &quot;went out of service&quot;.&nbsp; I heard the Lex investigation announcement, too.&nbsp; The N ended up going back downtown, express.&nbsp; Staff was very confused and didn&#039;t know what to tell us.&nbsp; All of the sudden a Queens-bound W pulled in and they told us to go across to the other platform Queens.

				-unlurking-<br /><br />I was at 59th around 5:30 and when the W came in astoria bound, the air coming out of the tunnel had a strong hint of soemthing burning. I&#039;d bet there was some minor track fire btw. there and 5th ave. Better to stop service or delay it than get a train of a few hundred people stuck in a crammed tunnel full of inherit dangers.<br /><br />As for the usual delays - and they are usual during a weekday rush hour unfortunately-&nbsp; it has a bit to do with the fact that ditmars is the end of the line and it only has two tracks. If it were a three track station, there&#039;d be more space to turn around the trains without backing up the line. It&#039;d cost millions to fix that and be politically unpopular to rework/expand the structure at ditmars, and probably impossible to boot with the hell gate viaduct there. so if you hate it, well, find another way to go cuz it&#039;s been this way since day one and there&#039;s no money/plans to change it.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a hint: If it&#039;s morning rush hour and you see trains backed up ditmars bound at broadway or even 30th ave, bet that some of the manhattan bound ones are going to be express right past you in some effort to get things back to normal.<br /><br />hey, i hate delays as much as the next guy so don&#039;t shoot me. these are just the observations/opinions of a life long astoria resident...<br /><br />and for anyone on here that remembers when the R ran to astoria, you all know how much better service is now than back then!

				I remember when I moved here. The gravely voiced woman who worked at..Horvatis? Realty, next to the Astoria Bagel shop on Ditmars. She told me how great the trains were that ran out here. The straphangers I believe voted it dead last. Anyway, I had read up on the service...it was indeed the N and R.....the quote was N &amp; R stood for Not Running. She didn&#039;t really seem to appreciate that.<br /><br />Yes I too have wondered what was going on in the evening going home and losing 10 to 15 minutes waiting between Astoria Blvd and Ditmars....the last two stops. It is especially maddening when the train pulls out a short way from Astoria Blvd. and then comes to a dead stop. Now you&#039;re there for the duration...thanks.<br /><br />Speaking of thanks.....I have another pet peeve about the N/W service at Ditmars....in the AM!<br /><br />Why oh why does the train that just pulled into the station leave first from Ditmars Blvd. w/out an announcement...usually near empty. Is this funny? Hey, how about speaking up and letting us all in on the joke MTA!

Wich I just love when I&#039;m trying to get home from work at 9:00 at night or even later.&nbsp; :x It&#039;s bad enough having to wait longer for a train at those times. More than once Ive gotten off at Astoria and just walked home from there. <br /><br />This morning it was running express inot the city again and I always feel bad for the people stuck at 30th Avenue and below watching the train roll past them. That must really suck. Why Astoria blvd doesn&#039;t get skipped I don&#039;t know. Maybe it has to do with the M60 bus that connects there.

				Folks, it is time for action.&nbsp; I no longer use the trains but for years had problems on the N (which was the R back then).&nbsp; I gathered a group of friends (no internet back then), found out who to call and we would make calls each and every time there was an issue.&nbsp; We &#039;harrassed&#039; them into adding more trains and would even go right up to the tower at Ditmars and ask all the Conductors what was going on.&nbsp; Very often, they simply did not have a response.&nbsp; More often than not, the problems are the result of incompetancy which starts right at the top of the Transit Authority.&nbsp; <br /><br />Astoria has grown tremendously.&nbsp; The infrastructure however, has remained static.&nbsp; Less parking now that they tore down the parking lot on Astoria Blvd, no additional busses or trains, no extra garbage cans etc.<br /><br />If you have any complaints about these issues, you must make every effort to voice them to our Community Board, our Council Member and in the case of train issues, directly to the Transit Authority.<br /><br />On Monday, I will post all the relevant telephone numbers and contact names.&nbsp; If everyone of us makes the calls, I guarantee you, they will listen.<br /><br />P.S.&nbsp; One time we nearly started a Revolution on the trains at Queensboro Plaza when they told us to get off the train and we absolutely refused.&nbsp; What happened?&nbsp; More and more people sat down in protest and they gave up and took us to our stops.&nbsp; Their excuse was the usual &#039;fire on the tracks&#039; but as we discovered, there was no fire at all!&nbsp; Case in point - you must challenge them.&nbsp; The Transit Authority see us as sheep that they must transport.&nbsp; We have to facilitate change.

				I feel like the delays are increasing lately in the past 2 years, and it&#039;s not just during rush hour.&nbsp; But yes, the N and R trains were always called the Never and the Rarely, so perhaps I&#039;m just paying more attention to it, and getting fed up.&nbsp; And there are tons more people in Astoria now, and those trains are so crowded, and with more people moving here, it&#039;s going to get worse.&nbsp; I agree something must be done, all our complaining on this board isn&#039;t going to get us anywhere.&nbsp; &nbsp;Debbie, thanks in advance for posting those numbers.&nbsp; I definitely think it&#039;ll take more than a few phonecalls to solve though - like you said - we&#039;d have to get our local reps involved, and call the news stations, get our complaints on tv and in the press, and thus make Bloomberg take action.&nbsp; He only does so, when there&#039;s a fire under his ass.&nbsp; It would be an uphill battle, not impossible, but change will only happen if we&#039;re serious enough to make it happen.

				The rusty wheel gets the oil. just don&#039;t expect politicians and the like to read this board - if you want to complain, you got to make it known. Though really, there&#039;s not much that can be done about the N/W at the moment except maybe get a dispatcher with a brain into the control room at ditmars (I wish I knew why they do stupid things like pull the train halfway out towards ditmars when they know there&#039;s no track open, or screw around and have one train leave before the other, etc).<br /><br />Debbie you hit the nail on the head - they keep changing things like zoning for taller buildings, squeezing more people into less space and not making any plans for increased infrastructure to support the increased population. Look at LIC - they&#039;re building hi rises all along the river but there&#039;s zero plans for a subway line or even bus route to move all of those people. What are they suppose to do? take a ferry across the river and walk? take the 7 at vernon where the train is already packed? those people are going to be paying a lot of money for next to no service.<br /><br />Just look at the Con Ed mess. They didn&#039;t add capacity or even maintain what they had... result? 8 day black out.<br /><br />Anyone also notice the loss of gas stations? They can&#039;t afford the rent... That one at bway and 31st is gone. There&#039;s one on astoria blvd. that looks like it&#039;s going...&nbsp; it&#039;s a citywide issue too - there&#039;s next to none left in lower/mid manhattan...<br /><br />These are all reasons I&#039;m starting to plot my escape from this town in the next 2-3 years. What was a nice place to live is going to be overflowing with people and not enough services to support them.

				Tonight I saw a brand new N.&nbsp; Right out of the package.&nbsp; I was at 59th and Lex and a new N came into the station.&nbsp; There were signs on the windows that said &quot;new R160 test run&quot;.&nbsp; It had plastic wrap over all the seats.&nbsp; It said it was out of service and didn&#039;t let any passengers on.&nbsp; ~9:45pm.

				Hey, <br /><br />The R got rerouted to the V/F line this morning around 7:00 AM, because of some &quot;condition&quot; at 57th Street.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t a problem for me because I work in lower Manhattan and there are plenty of opportunties to transfer along the route!&nbsp; However, for others it was like the end of the earth!&nbsp; Especially amusing to me was some guy who had his music up so loud (I could clearly hear the song) that he totally missed the repeated announcements from Queens Plaza and only realized that we were being rerouted at 34th Street.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know where he was going, but man, was he pissed!&nbsp;
