				Title: <strong>A Mother's Love - Fundraiser for Eli Wenner</strong><br />

				Dear Friends and Neighbors: <br /><br />The Astoria Moms Meetup Group (http://www.meetup.com/asahmgroup/) (Astoria Moms Group) is an active and growing group of over 150 mothers who live in and love Astoria. We exist to share all the joys and challenges of motherhood and to help build a community of families and friends here in Astoria. Occasionally, there is one among us who is tested greatly, and it is then that our group comes together as a supportive community.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Astoria Task Force for Mothers in Need (http://astoriataskforce.org) (Task Force for Moms), created by an organizing member of the Astoria Moms Group, consists of more than 50 moms who believe “it takes a village to raise a child.” Through this committed group of volunteers, we provide mothers living in Astoria who are in crisis with emotional support, emergency child care, donations of household necessities and family meals, and financial assistance.<br /><br />One of our Moms, Dena Wenner, has a beautiful little boy named Eli who is 2 years old and was diagnosed with Leukemia last summer. This news was all the more devastating because little Eli has had many medical issues; he was born with Down Syndrome and has already faced multiple hospital stays and surgeries in his life. For several months Eli’s mom has been by his side in the hospital 24/7 and his dad is a full-time law student, so you can imagine that the hospital bills and related expenses are a huge stress for this family.&nbsp; <br /><br />Eli’s Mom and Dad will tell you that he’s a fighter. On his good days, he’s a bundle of energy and his smile can light up a room. He steals the heart of just about everyone he meets. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />In December, the Astoria Moms Group and Task Force for Moms held their first event to raise funds to support Eli’s medical expenses and other critical needs. The event, a “Breakfast with Santa,” raised $2,700, primarily through ticket sales, cash donations from community members, and a raffle. The Breakfast was successful because of the touching sense of hope and love for children our community members share. Please see a list of our contributors to this event below.&nbsp; We are deeply appreciative and humbled by their support.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now, in celebration of Mother’s Day and the loving bond between a mother and her children, we are hosting a second fundraising event to continue our support for this family. At this event, “A Mother’s Love,” to be held Saturday, May 7th at Minos (on 33rd Street in Astoria), families will be able to gather in celebration of Mother’s Day with food, a donated performance from Music for Aardvarks, and a family photo portrait. We will also hold a raffle of wonderful eats, treats, and gifts. 100% of the proceeds will go to assist the Wenner Family to help cover living expenses and medical treatment not covered by insurance. We are expecting 150 people from the community to attend. <br /><br />Please consider attending the event, making a donation of goods/services that can be raffled, and/or making a cash donation to the family.&nbsp; Tickets for the event are limited, so please purchase them soon if you want to attend. Please click HERE (http://astoriataskforce.spruz.com/pt/A-MOTHERS-LOVE---A-FUNDRAISER-FOR-ELI-WENNER-5.7.2011/events.htm?a=&amp;) to purchase tickets<br /><br />We all have so much to gain from supporting Eli’s family. The Astoria Moms Group and Task Force for Moms are active members of your community; we are reaching out to the local stores where we shop, the local restaurants where we eat, and the local businesses we patronize, to ask you to help us help one of our own. <br /><br />We thank you in advance for your participation. If you have questions, or for more information on the fundraiser, please contact Robin Pelitaris at (718) 600-4211 or info@astoriataskforce.org. Also, note that donations can be made online by visiting http://astoriataskforce.org (http://astoriataskforce.org) and clicking on Eli’s Chip-in Page. <br /><br />Sincerely, <br />Your neighborhood Astoria Moms<br /><br />We thank the following businesses and individuals for their support of the Wenner Family to date. Your charity and kindness is deeply appreciated:<br /><br /><strong>Steinway Reformed Church, Brooklyn Bagels, Titan, Fresh Start Organics, The Giving Tree Yoga Studio, St. Honore Patisserie, Astoria Finest Bagels, Havana Express Bakery &amp; Café, Martha’s Country Bakery, The Parrot Market, and Dunkin Doughnuts (38th Street &amp; Ditmars Boulevard).</strong><br />
