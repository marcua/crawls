				I settled in this morning with a cup of coffee and the most recent issue of New York Magazine and opened to the cover story on Stephen Colbert.&nbsp; I realized that someone (in my building) had handily ripped the entire story from the pages of my magazine.&nbsp; &nbsp;What kind of person does this?&nbsp; Who are my neighbors?&nbsp; This story is readily available online for viewing, yet someone took it upon themselves to steal something from someone they live next to.<br /><br />The question I have now is, what shall I do?&nbsp; Write a strongly worded note and leave it near the mailboxes?&nbsp; (I know this had to be a neighbor as the magazine was left on the floor outside the mailboxes.)

				Don&#39;t jump to conclusions. <br /><br />Those pages could have been ripped out by a postal employee before it ever got to your address.

				I can read the story online, so I won&#39;t bother getting a new copy.&nbsp; Whether it was the postman or a neighbor isn&#39;t the point.&nbsp; My question is what makes people do this kind of thing?

				Sounds like they were not raised properly or with any manners or integrity.&nbsp; Sorry to hear they ruined your magazine.

				My roommate&#39;s copy is on the kitchen table, and I nearly did the same thing as I&#39;m a rabid fan of his&nbsp; :-P Not that I <em>would</em> &#39;cause that&#39;s beyond wrong. But she&#39;s gone for the weekend so I don&#39;t think she&#39;d object if I just read it.....!<br /><br />People are nuts, probably the same mentality that would swipe somebody else&#39;s lunch in the office &#39;fridge. I never understood how people could do stuff like that w/o a serious case of guilt.
