				Hi folks,<br /><br />I&#039;ve invited a big group of friends to my rooftop (apartment building near 23rd St. &amp; Ditmars) for a BBQ tomorrow.&nbsp; However, the Weather Gods are threatening my plans - the forecast right now gives a 50% chance of thunderstorms for tomorrow afternoon.<br /><br />If it rains, I&#039;d like to have a restaurant/cafe/bar in mind as a rain location.&nbsp; Does anyone have a suggestion for a place that 25-30 people could go?&nbsp; &nbsp;My only thought is the Beer Garden, which has that inside seating area downstairs.&nbsp; However, I&#039;m not sure if the Beer Garden serves food anywhere but in the garden.&nbsp; Does anyone know?&nbsp; Does anyone have an alternate suggestion?<br /><br />Many thanks!<br />

				Hate to be a bummer but BBq&#039;ing on the roof is against Fire Code and is dangerous. So you really should change plans anyway. Unless you want the FD to show up and give you trouble.<br /><br />Call the Beer Garden and see if you can use the downstairs room or what is available.

				You&#039;re going to have a tough time finding a place to accomodate that many people on such short notice.&nbsp; I would suggest getting a tent for your roof.

				Sacrifce a goat to Helios.&nbsp; Weather forcast might be improving!<br /><br />Also, if you still want that outside feel at the beer garden, get a few of your mates to to secure 3 or four picnic tables in the area under the beer garden tent.&nbsp; If you get there early enough, then it shouldnt be a problem.

Last week some yutz in one of the houses behind us ( meaning on Steinway St) decided to have a bbq on the roof, I know because I saw him bring it to the roof in the morning. My neighbor saw it too and he decided to call the Fire Department before anything happened. Well they came during the bbq, which btw had 50 people at it!!! Yes 50. On a effing roof. Not safe. I heard that the landlord and the tenant were each fined $500. So I don&#039;t suggest it at all. The beer garden has a restaurant inside, but 30 people at short notice, that and the fact that the service is, let&#039;s say, less than attentive. Anyway I trust weather forecasts about as much as I am able to throw the forecasters. <br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=11096.msg136654.html#msg136654">Quote from: Picasso on June 27, 2008, 10:26:26 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">not if you know how to do it.<br /><br />laws, laws....&nbsp; :roll:<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I guess you don&#039;t mind burning the neighborhood down then? A law is a law for a reason. Especially that one.

				A BBQ on a roof sounds fantastic (though not in the rain).&nbsp; I like AJTNYC&#039;s suggestion of a tent.&nbsp; Of course, you&#039;re not an idiot and will be careful and all.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m supposed to be having a backyard party for family tonight and am keeping my fingers crossed.&nbsp; If it rains we&#039;ll be crowding into my hot, too small for the event.&nbsp; That&#039;ll be fun!

				Vibe http://www.vibecafelounge.com/ (http://www.vibecafelounge.com/) has been completely underrated by this neighborhood and has great food and great service. It looks totally cheesy from the outside, like a bad 80&#039;s club, but having gone there consistently for the last couple of months, I&#039;m&nbsp; happy with a lot of things on their menu, slowly working my way through all of it. They&#039;re almost always empty because everyone is going to Grand Cafe, so I&#039;m sure if you call them ahead of time, they could probably accomodate a big group and they also have a nice open area in the back in case it stops raining. (By the way, I&#039;m completely unaffiliated with them and just happen to think they&#039;ve good great food and AWESOME double battered fries.)
