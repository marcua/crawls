				I use firefox and I use tabbed browsing.&nbsp; I have other sites loaded in each tab and when I opened a new tab today and typed in www.astorians.com I came here without a problem.&nbsp; I was on the site for some time since I had it in it&#039;s own tab,&nbsp; Going back and forth between tabs, I came back to the board and it kept on saying &#039;page not found&#039;.&nbsp; I closed the tab and opened&nbsp; new one and did the same thing.&nbsp; page not found.&nbsp; It did this to me for hours.&nbsp; I came home and figured I&#039;d check it and it was fine.&nbsp; This happens to me quite often.&nbsp; I also have free web surfing reign at work so it&#039;s not like the site is being blocked.&nbsp; It just doesn&#039;t find the page.&nbsp; It&#039;s happened to me here at home, as well.&nbsp; <br /><br />I always found it odd that after this happened no one ever inquired about it.&nbsp; I figured that that happening is what you guys meant as &quot;time outs&quot; but no one would type in those threads after it happened so I wonder who it&#039;s happening to.&nbsp; It can&#039;t just be me from 2 different computers in 2 different locations.<br /><br />I just thought I&#039;d bring it to your attention.&nbsp; &nbsp;:|

				Yes, on Mozilla it says &quot;page not found&quot; sort of like a 404 error in windows( laptop is a mac) so i leave it alone and come back to it later. It usually takes a few hours for it to be abke to connect again.

				It happens to me every single night around midnight, I get the &quot;server not found&quot; page.&nbsp; It&#039;s been happening for the past couple of weeks, I figured, since it&#039;s always around the same time that it was due to &quot;site maintenance&quot;.<br /><br />I can get on all my other sites with no problem but not this one.

				Hmm, &quot;page not found&quot; and &quot;server not found&quot; are quite different. If it happens to anyone again write it down!<br /><br />Maybe flaky DNS?

				I&#039;m thinking it might be DNS related as well because the server hasn&#039;t gone down for maintenance or reboot for quite a while. Please keep reporting when this happens and we&#039;ll see if we can get to the bottom of it.

				OK!&nbsp; It&#039;s happening to me right now.&nbsp; I&#039;m using AOL&#039;s browser (IE) and it let me on no problem.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been trying to get on through Mozilla Firefox and I&#039;m getting &quot;server not found&quot;.&nbsp; Forgive my confusion between the &quot;server not found&quot; and &quot;page not found&quot;&nbsp; I took a screen shot of what firefox gave me.<br /><br />(http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v142/jentopia/astorians.jpg)

				So, Firefox is giving you that error, but at the same time you can get on through AOL just fine? I mean when you experienced this problem you could use the site on one but not th other?

				it&#039;s happening again right now.&nbsp; I was on a little while ago (within the past two hours) without a problem and now I just went to go on and I got the same exact message using Firefox.&nbsp; I&#039;m now on AOL using their browser and I&#039;m able to log in.&nbsp; I don&#039;t understand.&nbsp; That is really weird.&nbsp; It happens with no other site but this one.&nbsp; :|<br /><br />and yes...while I&#039;m on the site using IE it still won&#039;t let me get in using FF.

				Did it happen today Dirk?<br /><br />To clarify, the problem we&#039;re addressing here is when the site &quot;blacks out&quot; for several minutes. It&#039;s normal for a site to occasionally not respond if packets are lost inbetween somewhere, but when you hit refresh and it doesn&#039;t work a second or third time this is indicates a problem with the server.

				Well I&#039;d say 4 out of 5 times it didn&#039;t respond for a few hours, not minutes, and that&#039;s using FF.&nbsp; I never checked it in IE until just a few days ago when I tried to pin point the problem.&nbsp;
