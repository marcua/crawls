				Something just occured.&nbsp; Police, ambulance, lots of kids talking about a stabbing.&nbsp; Typical situation on a hot summer day at Astoria Pool.&nbsp; Happens at least once a season, but this is a bit early in the season!&nbsp; I will try to get more information.&nbsp; Just saw an undercover cop push someone against a car and frisk him.

				Debbie, <br /><br />I just returned from the park and saw the same exact thing.&nbsp; We must have been standing right next to each other as the teen was frisked by undercover cop.&nbsp; I then went running on the track and when I came back through the cops were talking and one said something about a retaliation.&nbsp; Sounds gang related.&nbsp; When I first arrived I saw what appeared to be a decent spattering of blood on the ground where the alleged stabbing must have taken place.<br /><br />Even after the cops had dispersed the crowd random teens were squaring off with each other as they left.&nbsp; Saw about three near fights after that.<br /><br />

				It was another scene at the pool.&nbsp; For the locals, this is the worse time of the year.&nbsp; The crowds, no parking anywhere near the park, the filth they leave behind etc.&nbsp; Yesterday, I saw no less than four diapers around trees across the street from the park.&nbsp; Our dogs cannot even go into the park without finding hot dog remnants, pizza, sandwiches etc.

				Yes, that&#039;s the kind of set-up I was thinking of. If people pay even a little bit, they give the facilities and the people who work there more respect.&nbsp; In a perfect world, Paratactical, everything would be free and people would behave appropriately. Obviously that&#039;s not happening here and it&#039;s ruining it for respectful residents like Debbie and Jayme. <br /><br />I don&#039;t understand what you are inferring by asking &quot;why the heck do you think these kids do this anyway?&quot; <br />My question would be &#039;why should we allow them to act this way in the first place?&#039;

				I&#039;m not arguing with charging, I&#039;m saying that your intent (keeping out the &quot;riffraff&quot;) is disgusting and, quite frankly, I think the idea that $15-$25 can distinguish good people who should be allowed in the pool and riffraff you don&#039;t want in the same water as you is pretty nasty.<br /><br />As far as the other stuff, I probably shouldn&#039;t have thrown in that off-handed remark and I&#039;d rather not get into a debate about Kantian causality and determinism in the Astoria pool...

				It&#039;s $100 to get a tennis permit (for an adult). Why shouldn&#039;t there be a &quot;pool permit&quot; also? Or an adult/child rule (i.e., no one under 16 admitted without a parent/guardian/responsible adult)? I understand the need for a &quot;community pool&quot; but when the &quot;community&quot; that uses the facility is so out of hand that they make it unsafe and undesirable for the rest of the community to use, it&#039;s a problem.

				instead of immediately adopting a yuppie/park slope mentality of these people are broke so if <br />we charge money they won&#039;t be able to come to MY park, why not DEMAND <br />that local government implement better security? i&#039;m always amazed whenever i look inside the pool <br />at the almost non existent security and the VERY young kids who are lifeguards. <br />its kind of a miracle this doesn&#039;t happen a lot more.&nbsp; <br /><br />the idea behind PUBLIC parks and pools is for those who truly can not afford to go elsewhere <br />in this ridiculous, sweltering heat.<br /><br />

				I never said we should charge someone $25 to get in.&nbsp; &nbsp;I just called my old community pool, Heckscher State Park Pool, and they charge $2.00 for adults, $1.00 for children.. <br />I don&#039;t think anyone who is interested in using the pool to swim will refuse to pay that.<br /><br />Imposing a fee doesn&#039;t place a value on the people, it places a value on the service being provided.

				I don&#039;t disagree with Picasso&#039;s suggestion that if people pay a nomimal amount for use of the pool facilities, they might be more invested in keeping the area tidy and pleasant for themselves and others to use. &nbsp;It would also provide more resources for pool security.<br /><br />The public pool that I used growing up had entry fees and season passes. &nbsp;It wasn&#039;t a big deal or a policy designed to keep certain people out.

				Old timers, like myself recall that they used to charge a nominal fee like 50 cents to get into city pools. A 1 dollar charge, I don&#039;t think would be unreasonable, and it might encourage people to behave so they won&#039;t get thrown out and lose their dollar. Security could be improved, and it could overall be better managed.<br /><br />I keep hoping they could restore the diving pool. A small pool fee could go towards maintenance and management if they ever decide to do the right thing.

				I&#039;ve changed my mind on this. &nbsp;Charging a nominal fee doesn&#039;t keep out riff raff.<br /><br />2 parks I went to growing up, both Heckscher State Park and Smith&#039;s Point, are covered in trash now and they both charge nominal entrance fees. &nbsp;<br /><br />

				Picasso, my point is that money does not tell you if someone is good or bad so charging money to keep out bad people doesn&#039;t work. All it does is keep out people without money--all the good ones and the bad ones--and let in people with money--all the good ones and the bad ones.<br /><br />Charging to provide better janitorial services or better security is a completely different thing.

I wanted to be straight about what I consider riff-raff.&nbsp; If you keep hearing poor, then I will change my terminology to rude people, slobs and the violent.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also I actually changed my mind on this subject from &#039;nominal fee&#039; to &#039;no fee&#039; during this conversation. <br />I think it&#039;s good that you reminded us that it&#039;s not about the money. Rude people and slobs and the violent come from all enonomic levels.&nbsp; So I see this as a <em>values</em> conversation. What we really are upset about when you get down to it, is when people don&#039;t share our values, for keeping places clean, trying to be polite and aware of one&#039;s impact on others, not starting fights etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;So maybe we could implement a non fee-based measure to permit access to public&nbsp; facilities.&nbsp; One to create&nbsp; a collective agreement on standards and not discriminate. Like a civics-type test.<br />&nbsp; I get peeved when the onus is put back on the rest of the citizenry to try and get more funds or security to deal with people who misbehave when we know going in, that will be a steep uphill battle..&nbsp; We know the source of the problem is rude people, violent people and slobs.&nbsp; It&#039;s the whole lack of&nbsp; self-responsibility. That never even gets into the conversation anymore.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;I&#039;m pretty sure we stepped on each other&#039;s peeves here.&nbsp; But&nbsp; I always appreciate your comments as they are more thoughtful than many.

I wanted to be straight about what I consider riff-raff.&nbsp; If you keep hearing poor, then I will change my terminology to rude people, slobs and the violent.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also I actually changed my mind on this subject from &#039;nominal fee&#039; to &#039;no fee&#039; during this conversation. <br />I think it&#039;s good that you reminded us that it&#039;s not about the money. Rude people and slobs and the violent come from all enonomic levels.&nbsp; So I see this as a <em>values</em> conversation. What we really are upset about when you get down to it, is when people don&#039;t share our values, for keeping places clean, trying to be polite and aware of one&#039;s impact on others, not starting fights etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;So maybe we could implement a non fee-based measure to permit access to public&nbsp; facilities.&nbsp; One to create&nbsp; a collective agreement on standards and not discriminate. Like a civics-type test.<br />&nbsp; I get peeved when the onus is put back on the rest of the citizenry to try and get more funds or security to deal with people who misbehave when we know going in, that will be a steep uphill battle..&nbsp; We know the source of the problem is rude people, violent people and slobs.&nbsp; It&#039;s the whole lack of&nbsp; self-responsibility. That never even gets into the conversation anymore.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;I&#039;m pretty sure we stepped on other&#039;s peeves here.&nbsp; But&nbsp; I always appreciate your comments as they are far more thoughtful than many.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />For proper definitions of riff-raff check out this: http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=riffraff (http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=riffraff)<br /><br />And then there is this one: http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-rif1.htm (http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-rif1.htm) <br /><br />&nbsp;Hope that clears things up.<br /><br />&nbsp;BTW, where I grew up on Long Island there was a &quot;community pool&quot; which, even though it was &quot;open to the public&quot; you still needed a permit to enter.( that used to cost $25/year 25 years ago!)

				If anyone saw what we witnessed yesterday, the tone of this conversation would change. &nbsp;The kids were looking for a fight. &nbsp;Half of them had their pants slung beneath their butts, with large cloths hanging off their heads, cursing, yelling, fighting, running, threatening etc. &nbsp;They left a huge load of trash behind. &nbsp;Even my husband, who is more Liberal than anyone I know, said that these groups looked like gangs and that something was bound to happen, and it did! &nbsp;Believe me, having lived across from the Park for the past seven years, I had never seen anything quite like it.

				This is very similar to the whole history of the McCarren Park pool in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. &nbsp;It&#039;s a huge pool that had a glorious history in its day (1930s-1950s). &nbsp;It all went to hell in the 70s and was closed in the 80s for repairs. &nbsp;The repairs wound up being cancelled due to an outcry from the local community who cited increased crime and &quot;undesirables&quot; coming to the pool. &nbsp;It hasn&#039;t held water since. &nbsp;But oddly, it&#039;s now filled with graffiti and hipsters who hold live music concerts in the empty pool. &nbsp;Now there is talk of refurbishing the pool back to its glory days. &nbsp;No doubt it might have something to do with the fact that it&#039;s now surrounded by luxury condos. &nbsp;So what will become of our pool? &nbsp;From the sound of this lively discussion, you can imagine that our local politicians won&#039;t go near the issues of race or economics. &nbsp;If the crime increases, I believe the pool will be closed. &nbsp;Problem solved and no one is accused of being racist or classist. &nbsp;And furthermore, there will be a story put to the press about the pool being unsafe and requiring millions of dollars in repairs. &nbsp;Maybe a unique solution will be found, which would be nice. &nbsp;But ignoring it until there are murders taking place will not solve anything. &nbsp;

				Just because they were yelling, screaming, threatening, fighting and stabbing people does not mean they were gang members. Just because your saftey was imperiled, you should not besmirch these citizens expressing their freedom. Apparently it&#039;s also off limits to refer to these folks as rif raff even when their pants are hanging down past their butts. :evil:

Clothing style is how they identify/target alleged gang membership (and I&#039;m a defense attorney -- I know what I&#039;m talking about).<br /><br />The issue of gangs (or alleged gangs) at the park/pool and trash at the park/pool are getting unnecessarily intertwined.<br /><br />Trash makes the park/pool <strong>unpleasant</strong>.<br /><br />Gangs and/or violent and rowdy youth make the park/pool <strong>unusable</strong>. It makes the pool a dangerous environment for others, thereby acting as a deterent for those who just want to go swim, cool off, or otherwise enjoy flopping around in the water. It deters families, the elderly, and others who are intimidated by the crowds of rowdy, aggressive youth.<br /><br />Trash is icky. It&#039;s gross. It&#039;s unsanitary, but it can be cleaned up. It wouldn&#039;t likely deter anyone from going to the park or the pool. There has always been trash at the park/pool. There hasn&#039;t always been the rowdiness and violence that is prevalent today.<br /><br />

				I didn&#039;t mean to start a rumor that the pool was closing. &nbsp;All I said was that this same turn of events occurred in Brooklyn and the result was that the pool was drained and closed. &nbsp;I would doubt that Vallone or anyone else is going to be willing to suggest a fee to enter the pool. &nbsp;Or increased security, metal detectors, a civics exam, or anything else that will offend any particular group. &nbsp;History will suggest that when a difficult decision needs to be made, take the easy way out. &nbsp;Close the pool and make up a good excuse.

				After reading all this, I remember why I haven&#039;t gone back to that pool since I was 13 and<br />a group of older kids started grabbing at me and my two girlfriends. When we resisted, one<br />threw me in the pool and held me under until one of the adults we were with intervened. <br /><br />And it turned out that this group was &quot;visiting&quot; someone in the area for the summer. Luckily <br />no one was hurt as was with this stabbing incident, but these days violence happens so quickly<br />that you just blink and someone&#039;s seriously injured. <br /><br />Sorry, but I don&#039;t see why charging a fee either for the season or for so many number of <br />visits would be so terrible. I go to beaches on Long Islandwhere I pay a fee for the day <br />and they&#039;re infinitely cleaner, safer, and much better maintained than any NYC public beach.<br /><br />And this isn&#039;t some yuppie attitude - I&#039;ve lived here all my life and just think that local residents<br />shouldn&#039;t have to think about self-defense when they take the kiddies for swim to cool off.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Let&#039;s wall off the pool and turn it into a membership only club :)<br /><br />*kidding*<br /><br />My other complaint re: yesterday&#039;s pool chaos was that adult evening swim was canceled.&nbsp; On heat advisory days, pool hours are often extended (good idea) but that means lap swim gets canceled (sucky).&nbsp; The lap swim hours overlap a bit with extended pool hours but not entirely -- and these heat advisory days are days I&#039;d like to do a little grown up orderly lap swimming to cool off.&nbsp; It seems like parks policy could change a bit to allow for abbreviated adult lap swim time after the exentions of pool hours -- OR -- parks could allow the lap lanes to open at the regular time and allow adults to lap swim while the pool remains open.<br /><br />I just get grumpy when I suit up and sunscreen (after I check NYC.gov for post about extended pool hours), trudge down to the pool in 90+ degree heat, and get turned away at the gate during lap swim time.&nbsp; BLEH.

				First of all, I did not use the words &#039;riff raff&#039;.&nbsp; Secondly, allow me to clarify that the words &#039;gang&#039; did not come from us. it came from the kids.&nbsp; The kids who were passing by were talking about &#039;two gangs&#039;.&nbsp; And to clarify further, there is trash everywhere, but it does increase by about 100% when the pool opens.&nbsp; Bentley&#039;s Dad, I have been working on the trash issue for years, so I know what I am talking about.&nbsp; I personally purchased ten garbage cans for the park myself a few years back.<br /><br />This is the deal:<br /><br />The kids yesterday were like nothing I had ever personally witnessed.&nbsp; I am accustomed to seeing kids who are younger, who walk along talking loudly, pushing each other, but not violent.<br /><br />These were older kids - teenagers.&nbsp; I am sorry if my description of their way of dressing offends anyone, but it was not pleasant to see butts hanging out of pants and long rags dangling off their heads.&nbsp; It was also not pleasant for the other little kids to hear the amount of cursing that went on.<br /><br />There was more trash than usual.<br /><br />They began pushing each other and threatening each other, using the word &#039;kill&#039;.<br /><br />Someone said the words &#039;The Shivs&#039;<br /><br />What do you conclude from this information?

				The pool I went to as a kid had memberships.&nbsp; You paid a fee and you got an ID card.&nbsp; Later, I believe they had a computer database where you would sign in as you entered the pool. <br /><br />If the Astoria pool charged a small fee, they could do this.&nbsp; If someone breaks the rules, the membership is revoked and he or she is banned.&nbsp; <br /><br />Going back to the argument a few pages ago, I think that charging a fee would eliminate some of the misbehavior.&nbsp; People, regardless of where they come from, feel like they have a stake in a community when they are charged money to participate in the community.&nbsp; There&#039;s an, &quot;I&#039;d better not f___ this up, or I just blew x amount of money.&quot;&nbsp; Plus, because they invested money into the community, they feel like they are actually part of the community.&nbsp; Like it&#039;s more exclusive, even if the fee is only a few dollars.&nbsp; And people feel more unity with other members, because they&#039;re all part of this big super duper club.<br /><br />Membership cards exist partly for security purposes, but also because they have a psychological effect, as well.<br /><br />At least this is my opinion...

The worst things that ever happened was being splashed by some over grown teenager or having some Greek wannabe goddess cut ahead of us in line.

So maybe it&#039;s time a fee was proposed, nominal of course, to weed out the &quot;undesirables&quot;.<br /><br />As for it not being a beach club ON Long Island, well DUH we know it isn&#039;t.

				I&#039;m not clear on how the pool works. Even if it is free, don&#039;t people need to have registered with the pool or have an I.D. card? I was a lifeguard at a pool on Long Island, and an open pool policy like this was dangerous in case somethng happened to one of the kids. Although we didn&#039;t have a fee for open swim, the kids needed to register. <br /><br />I think this would be helpful as there would be a record of who comes to the pool. If they could swipe an I.D. card, the lifeguards would know who was there, if a child was injured, there would be a record somewhere of emergency contact info, etc. This may sound a little &quot;big brother is watching&quot; but so are a lot of cops standing around, which I agree, is a bit of an eyesore. <br /><br />Also, I think that registering may prevent people from &quot;crashing&quot; over to the pool, and instead &quot;planning&quot; to go for a swim. Certainly seems like a better solution that giving up on it, or expecting that just because we don&#039;t live in park slope or cobble hill that we should expect this behavior.

				Okay, since I live right around the corner from the park, the pool AND the projects, I have a few words to add....<br /><br />There are some bad kids in those projects right by the park (occasionally they congregrate right on my corner at 19th and 21st Road and they can be quite irritating), but there are also alot of working class families whose only solace from the summer heat is that damn free pool.&nbsp; &nbsp;Does it suck that there are kids making a bad example of themselves - yeah sure it does, but as yanksgooner points out - it&#039;s a CITY pool - there are some things that just come with the territory.&nbsp; <br /><br />Personally, I wouldn&#039;t be caught dead at that pool on the weekends (just like I have no desire to go to ANY public pool on the weekends) because it&#039;s a festering swamp full of kids and pee.<br /><br />I never knew there were adult swims there.&nbsp; That&#039;s kind of cool.&nbsp; I may check that out and the reason I&#039;m going to check it out is because it&#039;s FREE.<br /><br />

So you certainly can judge someone to an extent by how they dress, as how they dress is how they intend to present themselves. There are of course variations on how well this works, but the fact that these kids dressed like thugs and acted like thugs makes this judging by dress thing pretty accurate here. Not sure why you would be speaking against that in this case when Debbie&#039;s description of them was pretty clear on what they were like. I could see maybe complaining about someone judging someone who was walking down the street in baggy pants and a do-rag, minding his own business and going to pick up some fruit from the store. But these people, clearly thugs.<br /><br />As for the pool, if the city gives a crap they definitely should make people register and get IDs to go there. Not sure if there should be a fee- if there is, it should only be a couple bucks. But if people go there intending to act out of line, as these people clearly did, needing to register with a valid ID would probably make them steer clear. It is simply careless for the city to not put in a system like this. And if there&#039;s a line to get into the pool, they should check IDs in that line as well.

				I still don&#039;t get the outrage about charging a fee for the pool. When I was a kid in the 1970s, there was a nominal fee to get in -- it was small, but a fee nevertheless. They also provided keys for the lockers -- I believe that was 10 cents (I remember the keys -- they had an orange plastic top and pinned to your swim suit).<br /><br />Nassau County charges county residents a $5 daily fee for adults, $3 for children at their public pools. For non-residents the fee is $14-15, depending upon the park. Probably why their pools tend to be nicer, cleaner and safer.<br /><br />Frankly, I doubt that wealthier Nassau County residents are using the public pools -- they probably have their own in their backyards -- yet the county doesn&#039;t find the fee to be prohibitive for those from less affluent areas.<br />

				So, Peter Vallone emailed me back today.&nbsp; Here&#039;s his response (oh, &quot;thug&#039;s playground&quot; is the term I used in the original email):<br /><br />hey meg, thanks for your email.&nbsp; &nbsp; you should know that i grew up and still live a few blocks from the astoria pool (where my father lifeguarded), and actually went to the scene the night of the stabbing, after i observed the commotion.&nbsp; &nbsp;i personally spoke to Inspector McCarthy about the incident.&nbsp; he informs me that they know who the assailant is and an arrest is imminent.&nbsp; perhaps more importantly, the inspector believes that this is not a gang type incident, but more of an isolated testosterone fueled type.&nbsp; i have requested more of a police presence there in the future, tho as you probably know, the 114 (and every other precinct) is right now sorely short on police officers (a situation which is my top priority).&nbsp; please keep me advised as to the ongoing situation at the pool, as no one wants this jewel to become a thug&#039;s playground less than i do.&nbsp; on a related note,&nbsp; i was on the phone with parks commissioner benepe yesterday about reopening the diving pool, or changing it into a bandshell for artists.&nbsp; either way, i dont intend to allow it to sit as an eyesore any longer, and he appears to agree.<br /><br />thanks again for keeping me informed, and feel free to share this information with other concerned astorians...<br />pete vallone

				Peter is very responsive - when we had the gay bashing last year, he was instrumental in getting the attack categorized as a hate crime, keeping on top of the precinct and making sure that the ball wasn&#039;t dropped (they are finally going to trial too! - I think Joepocky will have news to report in a few weeks).&nbsp; I remain very impressed with Vallone, Jr.

I feel less safe walking around Astoria at night than I did ten years ago, the streets are dirtier, and the neighborhood is more crowded. Stores are opening and closing in the area at an alarming rate. <br /><br />Park Slope, on the other hand, has changed for the better and then some. People move there to raise their families now -- the schools are better, the streets are safer, and the neighborhood is spreading -- not only has Park Slope improved, but the surrounding neighborhoods have as well. The mom and pop store not only exists, but it thrives in Park Slope, there are great places to eat and y&#039;know what, they even have a coveted Barnes and Noble -- something Astorians only dream about.&nbsp; :wink:<br /><br />So if this board is sounding a bit too &quot;Park Slope&quot; for people, I really don&#039;t see the problem. Seems like something to aspire to, not necessarily condemn.

				Does anyone know if it has it ever been suggested to have timed sessions at the pool? <br /><br />As others have pointed out -- pool riots happen EVERY summer. This shouldn’t be shocking. Granted this most recent incident was more serious than others in the past but some of the postings in this thread have been close to being over the top.<br /><br />Yes, increased police presence at the pool, especially on hot days would help but isn’t this more a matter of better crowd management?<br />&nbsp; <br />It seems to me that part of the problem at the pool is that people wait for long periods of time to get into the pool, in the heat, for lengths of time that seem unending and they get understandably frustrated. Tempers flare and sometimes things get out of hand.<br /><br />The pool has a set capacity, wouldn’t be better to have 3-4 sessions, something like 10am-12:30pm, 1-3:30, 4-6:30pm or whatever and give out wrist bands or tickets to people with a set time they’d be able to enter? This way they don’t have to wait on line wondering when and if they will get in. They can go enjoy the park and come back at their assigned times. Once capacity has been reached for the day people are turned away. <br /><br />No need for admission fees, season passes or registration or any other type of suburban solutions that some have proposed.<br /><br />This may not solve the problem but it might help alleviate it and hopefully bring some order to the chaos.<br /><br />Thoughts?<br />

				Gleason while I agree with you on principle that the city should provide better services to the taxpayer the problems at Astoria Park and at the Pool are not exactly new and noteworthy. <br /><br />It is frustrating that an on-going problem can&#039;t seem to be managed but let&#039;s lay the blame for violent incidents where they belong -- on the people who cause trouble and make life miserable for all. Yes The city can take steps to help alleviate the problem but in all fairness they are not the cause of it.<br /><br />I sometimes wish there was a public outcry to do something about the public.

				mcdirk, let me first of all say that I respect your political connections and knowledge of city government. Your response is excellent. <br /><br />That being said, some nagging issues still linger:<br /><br />If, as you claim, the city council is powerless to increase the police force (which, if they made a big stink about I would find hard to believe the mayor would ignore) does it make sense to add massively to a population (as city council, the community board etc all seem to be eager to do for Astoria) if everyone knows the infrastructure (police, schools, etc) are lagging seriously and increasingly further behind?<br /><br />And again I ask you, knowing we have deteriorating services (less cops, increasingly crowded schools, a swamped emergency room at Astoria General, Con Ed, et al ), what is the leadership in our community doing about it besides addding to the problem by adding to the population?<br />

				I think we continue to disagree about whether services and their standards are related to an increase in population, so I&#039;ll decline to get back into that topic.&nbsp; I do think more funding for services should lead to better services and I think we need more attention from the Departments of Sanitation and Parks.<br /><br />The City Council, unfortunately, has been unable to make the Mayor do many things they&#039;d like him to do - I think the fight to re-open the 7 firehouses Bloomberg closed is the best example of this.&nbsp; They even went to court, one of a number of court fights between former Speaker Miller and Mayor Bloomberg.&nbsp; I&#039;m not a big fan of Mayor Mike Bloomberg, even though I do like some of his policies - I think he&#039;s arrogant and doesn&#039;t listen to people.&nbsp; I wish the system was more balanced, but under the last Charter revision, the power shifted to a strong Executive - the Borough Presidents lost almost all of their power and the old Senate of NYC, the Board of Estimate, was abolished, the House of NYC, the City Council, was expanded and is better, but they are quite unequal to the Mayor.

				&quot;The City Council, unfortunately, has been unable to make the Mayor do many things they&#039;d like him to do - I think the fight to reopen the 7 firehouses Bloomberg closed is the best example of this.&quot; <br /><br />...so why do they go along with his desire for increased development?!?!? Closing firehouses as you talk about adding a few hundred thousand in population is dangerous and irresponsible to the public&#039;s welfare. I think these are excellent points to be examined by someone involved in public safety. <br /><br />Unlike the Republicans, I for one believe there is a direct link between quality of services (and the quality of life in a community) and public funding for those services. I believe the first obligation to a taxpayer is to see that he gets value for his money.<br /><br />Now if we assume Bloomberg is a bad for Astoria, as you contend, and his policies could open our community to a declining quality of life, what are our local leaders doing about this besides making the problem worse by adding to our population big time?<br /><br />Lets open this discussion to others ... love to hear your comments

				Got home today and once again the field opposite my house was filled with trash, and the trash cans were full.&nbsp; This is a relatively small field.&nbsp; I went out there and filled three trash bags.&nbsp; It took over an hour to collect the garbage in the field.&nbsp; The stuff by the way, was strewn everywhere and much of it was too heavy to have simply flown out of the trash cans.&nbsp; There were half filled bottles of soda, half eaten sandwiches, etc. I believe in volunteer work, but this is getting ridiculous.&nbsp; One thing that gets me is that the park rangers are giving out tickets like crazy to people who have their dogs off the leash, but I really am not sure that they are doing the same for people who litter.&nbsp; So many of my friends have received tickets recently.&nbsp; Has anyone ever witnessed a ticket being given to a person who litters?

				On the 14th there was a Shoreline Cleanup, so some of the stuff got cleaned up then.&nbsp; Part of the problem is park users, but the other part is that garbage comes off the garbage barges in the East River and ends up on the shore.&nbsp; So, the source of the problem is mixed.&nbsp; Also, every September there is a big shoreline cleanup put on the the Waterfront Parks group.&nbsp; I encourage many people to join in the effort - I expect to be helping out with this cleanup.&nbsp; Astoria Park is one of the four main locations.&nbsp; Each year for the past couple of years there have been people from this board helping out, which is cool.&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				Good to know.&nbsp; There is a lot of vegetation beyond the guard rail towards the end of the park along the water.&nbsp; There are tons of broken glass bottles in there, and I imagine cleaning that up would be pretty dangerous.&nbsp; I think the city should take care of things like that, rather than volunteers potentially endangering themselves trying to do so.&nbsp; Those bottles have been there a long time and the vegetation is very tall.

				In response to some of your questions -<br /><br />Once again, I came home to a filthy field opposite my house.&nbsp; I took a large black garbage can and dragged it around half of the field and picked up - bottles, napkins, newspapers, wrappers, undershirts, broken pool gear, etc.&nbsp; I filled the bag and left it by the completely full garbage cans.&nbsp; <br /><br />Last Friday, when I collected the three bags of trash, nothing was picked up until Monday!&nbsp; We went all weekend with no garbage collection.&nbsp; I e-mailed Dot Lewandowsky (sp?) of the Parks Dept who is ultimately responsible for this park.&nbsp; <br /><br />On Monday, I will forward her e-mail to you folks.&nbsp; You should let her know how we feel about the filth in our neighborhood park.&nbsp; Also, since I am not proficient in sending photos online, it would not hurt to take a few and send them to her.&nbsp; If we all did this, perhaps it would help.<br /><br />Finally, I really do not care if the city does not have enough money.&nbsp; In fact, I think that is just BS.&nbsp; The boroughs are not getting their share.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Activity at the pool is the primary source of the trash.&nbsp; I have asked that they put together some sort of campaign to encourage young kids to clean up after themselves.&nbsp; They have a PA system - they should use it to remind kids that this is their park and they should use the trash cans for their garbage.<br /><br />We need:<br /><br />A campaign to encourage people to use trash cans.<br />More trash cans.<br />Additional garbage pick ups.<br /><br />Have a great weekend!

				I work for Parks answering correspondence from the public, among other things. This is actually an excellent era for the department since Bloomberg is all about improving the parks. So you can be sure that the e-mails and letters you write are being read and taken seriously.<br /><br />It might take a while to get a response (about two weeks, sometimes more), but that&#039;s b/c each and every one is routed directly to the people responsible, then back up for the Commissioner(s) to approve and sign.<br /><br />Each park gets inspected, and assigned ratings of &quot;acceptable&quot; or &quot;unacceptable&quot; for many criteria, including litter, cracks in the sidewalks, graffiti, even bird/dog poop. Pictures are taken as evidence for each inspection report.<br /><br />In fact, somebody wrote in a few days ago regarding a lack of bike racks in one park. The Commissioner himself made notes before this e-mail was routed, saying that bike racks are <em>absolutely necessary </em> in every park, and that we should be including them in all current and future construction projects. I routed this to the construction teams for each of the five boros, and today received confirmation that all those responsible were made aware of this important requirement.&nbsp; :mrgreen: How feasable it is, we&#039;ll see, but it&#039;s certainly encouraging. Shouldn&#039;t be too difficult.<br /><br />What sucks is how the general public is just ignorant- there are people who think that by littering, they&#039;re providing jobs for people who need them (aka, people who are beneath them and *deserve* to pick up after them.) They forget there&#039;s only a limited amount of money in the budget, and we can&#039;t employ a clean-up crew for every man, woman, child and dog that visit every park.<br /><br />

				OK.&nbsp; Here&#039;s the scoop.<br /><br />Apparently, the park&#039;s &quot;packer&quot; (which I believe is just a green sanitation-type truck) has been broken for the past three weeks.&nbsp; &nbsp; The person designated/assigned to fixing it is, go figure, on va-freaking-cation.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />That would explain the recent mess in the park to some degree.<br /><br />I was also told that the garbage containers disappear from time to time as they are perfect BBQ size.

				It may have been just about 25 kids.&nbsp; As far as what I would say to them, I would simply and nicely tell them to use the trash cans.&nbsp; About seven years ago, when I was an active parks volunteer, I saw someone going into the park with all of his barbeque gear.&nbsp; When I informed him that barbequeing was against park rules, he put down his gear, started to threaten me, and followed me all the way from 24th Avenue to Ditmars, threatening to &#039;cut me up&#039;, &#039;rape me&#039; etc.&nbsp; I did not go home, but went to a friends house and called the police.&nbsp; They came and I filed something against him, although I do not recall exactly what it was.&nbsp; He wound up leaving the park.&nbsp; I have also had some positive experiences, a few times, I have given kids $5 each to clean up one of the fields and they were very happy.&nbsp; Also, I have given out garbage bags to people having picnics and they were very receptive.&nbsp; That was my one and only bad experience.<br /><br />I agree that the park was cleaner than usual yesterday, and it looks pretty good today.&nbsp; One thing I&#039;ve noticed, there is a lady who sells some kind of food products that I do not really recognize.&nbsp; It looks like mangoes on sticks, corn on sticks, some kind of snacks etc.&nbsp; Yesterday, she stood on the sidewalk outside the park and sold items to people leaving the pool.&nbsp; When she moved on, she left a trail of trash behind her.&nbsp; If you see corn cobs strewn around the park, her customers are the source of this.&nbsp; If I see her today, I will ask her to take her trash with her, although I may need an interpretor.&nbsp; <br /><br />As summer winds down, unless there is a heat wave, I find that the crowds thin out.&nbsp; The best time of the year is right after Labor Day.&nbsp; The park is delightful!&nbsp;

				Wouldn&#039;t a fee for using the pool at least provide enough additional funds to pay for come extra garbage cans in the park?&nbsp; <br /><br />Not to suggest that a fee will/won&#039;t make the pool a safer place.&nbsp; Just that if the budget is tight and funds are needed, wouldn&#039;t it make sense then to get these needed funds in the form of a fee from the pool?&nbsp; It just makes sense.<br /><br />BTW; if the Olympics would have come to NYC in and they would have fixed up the pool (as was part of the original design presented to the Olympic committe), does anyone really think that in order to maintain the newly restructured pool in good shape a usage charge wouldn&#039;t have been implemented?&nbsp; Of course it would have been.&nbsp; The Olympic money would have paid for the redesign for the pool for the Olympics, not the upkeep of the pool after the games left town.<br /><br />I like Vallone&#039;s idea of using the diving board section of the pool for something.&nbsp; It&#039;s been dormant for far too long.&nbsp; I &quot;deep&quot; pool section (6 feet and deeper) I think would be great.&nbsp; Though I&#039;m guessing most on the board would probably opt for something else.&nbsp; Hey, at least they&#039;re finally going to do something with the place !!!
