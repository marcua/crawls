				I feel the same way braun. <br /><br /><br />https://www.facebook.com/licbeerproject?_rdr=p<br /><br /><br />We drove by this place last week on our way back from the city. Any Astorians been there yet? It&#039;s in LIC, but a lot closer than Ridgewood!

				I should add that B&amp;T Brewery is a locally run business by a family that has strong ties to the community. The guy who runs it was making the beer in his garage and built the space in Ridgewood out on his own, to my understanding. He makes some great beer that all have interesting stories behind them, and is an all-around good guy. I&#039;m a big fan of their coffee cream ale (Twenty Spot and a Switchblade), and they&#039;ve also got IPA&#039;s (including a habanero IPA), a dunkel, a rye IPA, etc. <br /><br /><br />LIC Beer Project focuses on belgian beers and I know they&#039;ve started barrel aging some stuff too. Definitely a lot of $$$ behind their space; they basically opened the space before their beer had been produced.<br /><br /><br />Both produce really good beer and I&#039;m happy to drink it.

				Hey friends,<br /><br />Thanks &#039;mom&#039; for the post. Thanks King of LIC. Word got to me, and I figured I&#039;d come to the table. <br /><br />I&#039;m the brewer, founder, keg cleaner, beer distributor, grain composter (insert additional jobs and/or disparaging comments here) for Bridge and Tunnel Brewery. <br /><br />Yes, we finally opened in a real space after 3 years slugging it out in a 150 square foot garage on a self built nano system in Maspeth Queens. <br /><br />I am from Queens originally, and spent 10 of my 13 years brewing as a homebrewer - making 2.5 to 5 gallon batches out of my studio apartment in Astoria (off of 21st street near the sculpture park) then off of Vernon at the end of 30th Ave). I was dreaming brewery dreams well before there was any craft beer anywhere in Queens. Back then, I hung out at Gibney&#039;s on Broadway - before it became Gilbey&#039;s. Since I went micro - my beers have been on tap at Sunswick, ABC Broadway and Ditmars, Crescent and Vine, the great Queens Kickshaw. In fact that coffee cream ale mentioned was made for Kickshaws 2nd anniversary and tells the story of Ben&#039;s formative years growing up. So..... I&#039;m from the hood and you will see me here. My roots go deep in Astoria as well as Ridgewood/Maspeth. <br /><br />Ridgewood right now is Astoria 10 years ago. Its changing but the original working class community is stubbornly holding onto the history. So its becoming a mix of new locals and old locals - long time businesses and new. Don&#039;t write it off. My brewery is right off of the L line (Halsey Stop). Ridgewood is not another state - its South West Queens, working class hood with a ton of history, including deep brewing roots going back to Prohibition . If you drive, its all of 10 minutes and there is actually parking when you get here. <br /><br />And yeah, its a self built brewery that I pieced together - ground up, every aspect from the current 300 gallon system to the farmhouse tables, bar counter - and 90% on reclaimed/repurposed materials and equipment. I&#039;m currently pouring 9 lines including a recent oyster Stout, a double rye IPA, and even a &#039;house&#039; Kombucha. Since I&#039;ve spent years missing out on trying beers that I couldn&#039;t afford, I&#039;m pouring 5 dollar pints, 3 dollar 10oz pours, 8 dollar flights (4 five oz samples). Like I said, we&#039;re a working class community, and I&#039;m trying to make my tap room experience an accessible one. You can bring food or order in (a group last week came in with a six foot hero). No problem. My next door neighbor is Houdini Kitchen Laboratory - wood fired pizza that may be the best in Queens right now housed in a former pre-prohibition brewery. Tell Max your at the brewery and they&#039;ll deliver. The new location is 15-35 Decatur Street, Ridgewood. Tap room hours Sat and Sun 1pm to 9pm. I&#039;m behind the bar every Saturday, and enjoy shooting the shite as well as pulling through with full pours every time for my peeps. For a preview, links and rough website below. Cheers. <br /><br />http://www.ridgewoodsocial.com/artist/bridge-tunnel-brewery/<br /><br />www.bridgeandtunnelbrewery.com<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Their danishes are the real deal, too. It&#039;s the last remaining German-style bakery in a neighborhood that once had a huge German population.

				Looking forward to checking out Bridge and Tunnel Brewery. Ridgewood is a great neighborhood, with one of my favorite restaurants anywhere, Bunker. It&#039;s a cool, modern Vietnamese spot. Happy to send some Astoria love Ridgewood&#039;s way.
