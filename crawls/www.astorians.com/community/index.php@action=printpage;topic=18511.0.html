				Does anyone know if there&#039;s community choir for Astoria? I know we have the Astoria Performing Arts Center, but didn&#039;t see anything about a choir.<br /><br />If it doesn&#039;t exist... anyone interested in forming one?&nbsp; Maybe something to officially start in the fall?

				I&#039;ve actually thought about proposing this before.&nbsp; I love singing choral music and worked as a church music/choir director out on Long Island when I was in grad school and really enjoyed it. My forte as a singer is a capella music in a small ensemble but singing larger works is also fun.&nbsp; I&#039;d be open to exploring putting together a choir some more - fall would be a reasonable start.&nbsp; In the meantime, getting a group together to read madrigals or something over summer could be a treat!

				I know I&#039;m interested.&nbsp; I am a sacred music major, who&#039;s become rusty LOL.&nbsp; I used to sing with the Stonewall Chorale, but trekking to the village and a hefty work schedule cut that.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to do something local.&nbsp; I also like the idea proposed about madrigal singing!&nbsp; I&#039;d be interested in joining folks for that and for a community choir in the fall.

				I would also be interested. I sang in many choral groups (and solo performances as well) until I went to college. I miss singing. If it was local, I would definitely be motivated.&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				Sounds awesome, you two!&nbsp; I&#039;d be happy exploring this some more.&nbsp; Let&#039;s see if anyone else responds to this thread and by next week, maybe whoever is interested could get together and do some sight reading?&nbsp; My harpsichord is hopefully returning in the next couple of weeks, so meeting at my house could be an option.&nbsp; Why don&#039;t you PM me in the meantime and we can chat over regular email when the time comes.<br /><br />What vocal parts to each of you like to sing?&nbsp; I&#039;ve sung a range from mezzo/alto (I sang - quietly - the low F in Music for 18 Musicians) to soprano.&nbsp; Depending on the literature, I&#039;m pretty flexible.

				I generally sing soprano, it make take a few weeks of practice to get back up to my highest range, but I feel confidant. I can sing alto too, not sure of my low range, but in nearly every choir I participated in I was always placed in the soprano section.<br /><br />So my history is: I sang in a secular 15 girls choir for 3 years. I also sang in a smaller adult choir in a church, and was the solo cantor for 2 masses a week for about 4-5 years. Sprinkle on top lots of musical theatre. This time was definitely the height of my singing. Then I went off to college and my life and career turned away from music.<br /><br />PM on it&#039;s way... I hope we can gather some others, this would be such a great way to enjoy singing! Private concerts in the car lost there novelty a while ago, haha.

				I got your PMs, deaghaidh and okkichan!&nbsp; I&#039;ll be in touch. As a trio (essentially SST or SAT) we could do some medieval music.&nbsp; But we need a bass for things from the 16th century and beyond.&nbsp; Any basses out there?&nbsp; Know anyone? :)
