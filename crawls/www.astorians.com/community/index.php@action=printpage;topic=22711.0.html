				Does anyone know what the construction site on the northwest corner of 20th Avenue &amp; Steinway is? It appears to be stalled. Was walking by it again today and couldn&#039;t find any permit or construction info on the plywood around it. Thanks.

				Not sure the exact reason. It&#039;s been like that for almost 4 years that I&#039;ve lived around the neighborhood :(.

				That site perplexes me.<br /><br /><br />It seems like they stalled for so long that they&#039;ll have to knock everything down and rebuild it again because the material is rusting and wasting away after all these years.<br /><br /><br />What a pointless project. I was always interested to see what they&#039;d make there. Turns out it&#039;ll never be anything.

				Interesting. Always wondered what it was meant to be. We still remember how loud it was when they first laid the foundation.<br />How funny on that link - they are trying to lure retailers and it says - no grocers within 5 miles!<br />You can throw a stone without hitting a grocery store in the area.

				I was told that the architect and/or his engineer failed to order or obey the requisite geological study neccessary for building in NYC. They continued construction until DOB shut them down. Evidently, the geology underneath the planned structure would not support the weight of the building.

				Exactly my point!<br />oh - i meant to say &quot;can&#039;t&quot; - there are an embarressment of riches of grocery stores in the nabe.<br />The listing says 5miles! - haha - 5 miles - there is Best Yes, Berry Market, Trade Food, Key Food - <br />and many more if you are really measuring 5 miles - which is a ridiculous metric in NYC

				I don&#039;t know, it actually looks like they&#039;ve started some of the work there in the last few weeks. I can&#039;t point to anything specific (because I see it only on weekends), but there seems to be some change there as of late.<br /><br /><br />I was wondering if they were preparing it for something new, and that PDF you posted, rsx474, seems to indicate something. I wonder what the retail will be. It&#039;s a strange place for retail.
