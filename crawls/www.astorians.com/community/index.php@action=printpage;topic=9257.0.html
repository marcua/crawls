				Hello,<br />My boyfriend and I both live in Astoria. He just turned 21, but I am still 19. Most of our friends in the Astoria area are 21 or older. What are good bars/restaurants with a good bar (and not too expensive) in the Astoria area (Ditmars/Astoria Blvd/30 Ave preferred) where my boyfriend and our friends could drink, but I would be able to get a soda/food and enjoy their company? <br />**Just to be clear, I am not asking what places don&#039;t card or something to that extent; I do not intend on drinking**<br /><br />Thanks in advance!

				Here are a few recommendations:<br /><br />Fatty&#039;s (Ditmars and Crescent)<br />Bohemian Hall/Beer Garden (24th Ave and 31st St.)<br />Grand Cafe (30th Ave and 37th St.?)<br />Stove (28th Ave and 46th St.)<br /><br />Any place that serves food and has tables should be able to accommodate you and your boyfriend/friends.

				Brick (on 31st Ave and 33rd Street) also has food/drinks and a more bar-ish area in the back that still serves food.

				Ref. the Beer Garden - at least during the summer months, I&#039;ve heard that they will let people under 21 into the garden itself only until 9pm.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure exactly how it works in terms of leaving (i.e. whether you also have to leave by 9pm).<br /><br />It might be different in the downstairs restaurant area or during the winter; I&#039;m not sure.

				You also might want to check out Rapture. I know in addition to serving drinks they also serve food. Rapture is on 28th Avenue - I am pretty sure its between 35th and 36th Street.<br /><br />Also Cafe/Bar. They serve drinks, food and coffee, etc. I took my 20 year old niece and her friend there after a movies at night and no one batted an eye. Cafe Bar is on 34th ave and I believe 35th or 36th Street.
