				This is actually &quot;Gujerati Carrot Salad&quot; from &quot;Indian Cooking&quot; by Madhur Jaffrey, but the colors, bright orange and black, are perfect for Halloween.&nbsp; The directions say to grate the carrots coarsely, but I put chunks of carrots in a food processor and grind them fine, in batches.&nbsp; I also make about 3 times the amount, using 3 1-pound bags of carrots, or 1 3-pound bag, and tripling the other ingredients.&nbsp; You don&#039;t have to measure exactly, everything&#039;s to taste.&nbsp; My 7 oz bag of Maya brand black mustard seeds, purchased about 6 months ago, cost $1.29 in Trade Fair&#039;s Indian section, and will make many many batches of salad and are used in other Indian dishes, so all the ingredients are inexpensive.&nbsp; You can use just about any cooking oil.&nbsp; If you&#039;re new to mustard seeds, don&#039;t go anywhere while they&#039;re on the fire, though you won&#039;t be the first cook to have them fly out of the pan if you have the fire too high or don&#039;t take the pan off fast enough.&nbsp; The mustard seeds add a smoky flavor, and they don&#039;t taste anything like the mustard you&#039;re used to putting on hot dogs.&nbsp; The only other things I can think to tell you is that 3 pounds of ground carrots take up a lot of room so plan on a big bowl if you make that much, and that it&#039;s hard to judge what one carrot looks like when ground so it&#039;s very easy to over-indulge in this instantly addicting salad.&nbsp; Because the salad is finely ground you&#039;ll probably eat it with a spoon, not a fork.<br />The recipe as written in the book:<br />Serves 4<br />5 carrots, trimmed, peeled, grated coarsely<br />1/4 teaspoon salt<br />2 tablespoons vegetable oil<br />1 tablespoon whole black mustard seeds<br />2 teaspoons lemon juice<br />In a bowl toss the grated carrots with the salt.&nbsp; Heat the oil in a small pan over a medium flame.&nbsp; &nbsp;When hot, put in the mustard seeds.&nbsp; As soon as the seeds start to pop (which happens quickly), pour the oil &amp; seeds over the carrots.&nbsp; Add the lemon juice and toss.&nbsp; Serve right away (slightly warm from the oil) or chill.
