				Some articles on the topic (not this one) have quoted some people who aren&#039;t so happy about the ads. But I&#039;m looking forward to seeing them :) <br /><br />http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/10/21/new.york.subway.ads/<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">NEW YORK (CNN) -- Some New Yorkers may want to reconsider exclaiming &quot;Thank God&quot; when arriving at their destination subway station beginning Monday.<br /><br />Or at least that&#039;s what a coalition of eight atheist organizations are hoping, having purchased a month-long campaign that will place their posters in a dozen busy subway stations throughout Manhattan.<br /><br />The advertisements ask the question, written simply over an image of a blue sky with wispy white clouds: &quot;A million New Yorkers are good without God. Are you?&quot;<br /><br />On October 26, a dozen bustling New York City subway stations will be adorned with the ads as &quot;part of a coordinated multi-organizational advertising campaign designed to raise awareness about people who don&#039;t believe in a god&quot;, according to a statement from the group, the Big Apple Coalition of Reason.<br /><br />New York City&#039;s subway system is one of the busiest in the world with more than 5 million riders per day and more than 1.6 billion total passengers in 2008, according to the Metro Transit Authority.<br /><br />Recognizing this, the Big Apple Coalition of Reason decided the &quot;best bang for the buck&quot; was to place posters in popular subway stations to capitalize on the amount of potential viewers, says Michael De Dora Jr., executive director of the New York Center for Inquiry, one of the associated atheist groups.<br /><br />De Dora says the ambitions behind the advertisements are threefold.<br /><br />First, the coalition hopes the promotion will enhance awareness of New York City&#039;s secular community. He explained that the coalition also hopes to encourage &quot;talking and thinking about religion and morality,&quot; as well as support involvement in groups that encourage a sense of a social community for non-believing New Yorkers.<br /><br />John Rafferty, president of the Secular Humanist Society of New York, another member group of the coalition, said the ads are in no way an anti-religious campaign. They are looking to reach out to more people who have similar feelings, but might not be aware of an outlet to express their beliefs, he said.<br /><br />Rafferty and De Dora cite the American Religious Identification Survey, released earlier this year, as evidence of a shift away from organized religion. Those checking &quot;none&quot; for religion rose from 8 percent of the population in 1990 to 15 percent in 2008, effectively making &quot;no religion&quot; the fastest growing religious identification in the United States.<br /><br />De Dora said that the &quot;million&quot; New York nonbelievers mentioned in the advertisements is the result of an extrapolation based on the survey&#039;s findings. With more than 8 million residents living in New York&#039;s five boroughs, the organization projects more than a million potential atheist New Yorkers.<br /><br />De Dora said individuals &quot;don&#039;t need religion to be good people and productive members of society&quot; and ultimately he feels that groups of nonbelievers are &quot;adding to cultural life of NYC.&quot;<br /><br />The United Coalition of Reason, which is a national organization that helps local groups advocate atheist ideas, approached the New York nonbeliever associations in August with an offer of a donation from an anonymous source to help pay for the subway station ad campaign. The donation amount was for exactly $25,000 and specifically allocated for the subway advertising promotion.<br /><br />Rafferty says the groups involved expect no substantial backlash over their ads. Since news of the campaign was made public early this week &quot;reaction has been mixed,&quot; De Dora said. He emphasizes that the Big Apple Coalition of Reason ads are not &quot;forcing issues, they&#039;re just getting ideas out there,&quot; with the hope of fostering discussion in New York.<br /><br />The ads are &quot;not poking fun at religion and not being outright nasty,&quot; he said.<br /><br />A year ago some unease was caused by advertisements that ran inside subway cars promoting Islam. While the ads themselves weren&#039;t controversial, they were partially funded by an imam of a Brooklyn mosque who served a character witness for convicted 1993 World Trade Center bombing mastermind Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman.<br /><br />In a statement to CNN, Metro Transit Authority spokesman Aaron Donovan said, &quot;The MTA maintains basic advertising guidelines with prohibitions on nudity, four-letter words, and the like. Beyond that, to accord with the First Amendment, our advertising guidelines are written so as to not prohibit the free exercise of religion or abridge the freedom of speech.&quot;<br /><br />According to the Big Apple Coalition of Reason in their statement, the New York City campaign is just one component of a &quot;nationwide effort&quot; by the United Coalition of Reason that will see billboards and postings in transit systems across the United States.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I love it. About time atheists got some credit. It&#039;s crazy how non-believers are looked down upon as &quot;evil.&quot;<br /><br />My only concern is that it&#039;ll cause heated debates, which only amount to &quot;Yes there is!!&quot; and &quot;No there isn&#039;t!!&quot; <br />

				There&#039;s a movie out now that shows the religious fever sweeping the nation in the form of megachurches and fanatacism. I think the atheism ads are the tip of the iceberg as a response to this. BUT, it does worry me that the new fanatics and newly-outed atheists will clash severely.<br /><br />My new mother-in-law is a very religious person. When my now husband moved in with me over a year ago (before being married), she wrote him a nasty, insulting letter about me that he said was &quot;so bad, I didn&#039;t get past the first sentence, and then I shredded it.&quot; He refuses to tell me what she wrote. And she wonders why the wedding excluded God references altogether (not that she didn&#039;t try to convince the officiant to change the ceremony.)&nbsp; :-(<br /><br />I can understand the reasons for having a religion, but it&#039;s the need to <em>inflict</em> it on everybody else that baffles me, especially in mean, hateful ways.

				I dunno, my life without God isn&#039;t much different than it was &quot;with&quot; God. <br /><br />Who do I go to for forgiveness? The person I wronged, and myself. <br /><br />Salvation? Heaven and Hell are here on Earth. Live a good life, be disciplined, and reap the &quot;heavenly&quot; benefits. Live for the fast, easy pleasures, and suffer &quot;hell&quot; for it.

				Using Turbo Tax is arrogant?&nbsp; :wink: I have faith in my resources.<br /><br />And life isn&#039;t even as complicated as taxes. Primates have a sense of right and wrong, and actually use moral principles to guide their groups. That&#039;s because jealousy, envy, greed, anger etc. have repercussions that influence the group as a whole, and they act accordingly to enforce good behavior. No need to chisel these things in stone to understand what&#039;s &quot;good&quot; and what&#039;s &quot;bad.&quot;<br /><br />Meanwhile, Christianity teaches nonsense like condoms are bad. This, while millions of people die from HIV. The Bible condones all sorts of violence, slavery, and misogyny. Jesus himself preached that slaves must be unquestioningly faithful to their masters. Other religions teach nonviolence, kindness, and other principles that are much more productive. <br /><br />I find it better to question everything than take any one source&#039;s &quot;word&quot; as law. Atheists look to science and reason for answers, and use basic ethics as a guide. <br /><br />I&#039;ve seen the little propoganda comic books lying around the in-laws&#039; house for the kids, and it&#039;s just awful.

				While I&#039;m all for that myself, the reality is, not everybody lives by that. Why impose your own judgement on how they live their lives, causing all the suffering and death? Why can&#039;t two consenting adults have sex for the enjoyment of it, provided they&#039;re not cheating on anybody? <br /><br />Like I said, it&#039;s not how I live *my* life, but there are plenty of non-evil people dying from HIV. To say that religion protects you from dying a horrible death is kinda silly. <br /><br />In countries where there&#039;s no official religion, and people are taught about responsible sex practices, there&#039;s much less teenage pregnancy and STDs etc. What&#039;s wrong with that? Studies show that absitnence training only delays teen sex by an average of 18 months, and doesn&#039;t &quot;count&quot; other forms of sex.<br /><br />Having sex in a committed, loving relationship is GOOD, but not just b/c it pleases God. It makes better sense, that&#039;s all.

				Ditto.<br /><br />I also think religion is a deeply personal thing and many-layered.&nbsp; But I have to say that there is a certain stupidity to the aversion to contraception.&nbsp; Not only does it help prevent the spread of disease - - which even in loving committed relationships people can have --- it also prevents pregnancy.&nbsp; To tell someone to use the rhythm method and nothing else because our only purpose in life is to procreate is, I&#039;m sorry, but it&#039;s just hard-headed, unrealistic, false, and stupid.&nbsp; &nbsp;Sex is not just for making babies.&nbsp; Far from it.&nbsp; Most of us actually enjoy sex, whether in committed relationships or not.&nbsp; Every once in a while the Pope will speak up about this contraception issue, and the whole thing just perplexes me.&nbsp; It&#039;s just backwards.&nbsp; And it&#039;s not good for society at large.<br />

Where will they get the money to pay these fines? I assume your next step will be to blame the parents, so naturally they should have to pay the fine on behalf of their kids.<br /><br />Please address the concern of the inevitable explosion in abortion rates.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t expect an increase in popularity of abortion, please explain what you want to happen to all of the babies.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure what you mean when you say &quot;the trends with regards to sexual behavior have changed&quot;.&nbsp; They actually haven&#039;t. We just talk about it more openly now.&nbsp; People have been having the same kinds of crazy weirdo sex since the beginning of time and that includes oral/casual/hookup sex.<br /><br />I also love how you turned it into a money issue instead of an ethical one.&nbsp; So you want to punish people for having sex when they&#039;re young because it&#039;s wrong, but jail is too expensive and fines are a great way to generate some revenue because sex is just like double parking (if you&#039;re into that, I suppose).

				Anyway. The book I&#039;m reading addresses Christians specifically, but is a great read for anybody. I need to research some of the points they make, though. <br /><br />One is about stem cell research. The author says that the cells they use amount to fewer than are found in the brain of a fly. Yet, the research could help with all kinds of medical breakthroughs, such as helping burn victims and parapalegics. <br /><br />The same people who protest this research are essentially allowing humans to continue to suffer, and probably have no problem killing flies......or eating meat.<br /><br />I did have to chuckle when he added a quote from the book of Deuteronomy: &quot;If a man finds, on his wedding night, that his bride is not a virgin, he may stone her to death on the doorstep of her father.&quot; And people wonder why we didn&#039;t have a priest officiate......&nbsp; :-P

				Just b/c somebody doesn&#039;t believe in God, doesn&#039;t mean they believe that &quot;whoring around&quot; is a great idea. <br /><br />Besides, how does that explain priests &quot;whoring around&quot; with innocent children? Or televangelists who sleep with their secretaries? Yeah, great Christians ya got <em>there</em>&nbsp; :roll:<br /><br />Christianity is NOT automatically synonymous with morality. Nor is atheism the same thing as evil. You can be an amoral Christian just as you can be a moral atheist. One has nothing to do with the other, except that labeling yourself &quot;Christian&quot; is like branding yourself with a name that implies &quot;holier than thou.&quot;<br /><br />How funny that people have to define themselves as &quot;non-believers.&quot; It&#039;s not like people have to define themselves as &quot;non-&quot; anything else. &quot;Hi, I&#039;m a non-astrologist.&quot; &quot;Nice to meet you, I&#039;m a non-alchemist.&quot; This, in spite of the fact that there is no solid proof of God, aside from some really old books written by and about mysterious people.

				As far as televangelists and priests &quot;whoring around&quot; they were obviously phonies, wolfs in sheeps clothing. Yes I am the first to point out that Christianity has many, many phonies out there, many false prophets. Most, about maybe 90 percent of the televangelists you see on TV are not preaching the truth. Jesus Himself told us that in the last days there will be many false teachers among us. The New Testament is filled with warnings about these people. I am not defending them, I despise them. But there are true believers who have given their lives to God, who work at soup kitchens, who become missionaires and feed the poor in third world countries, who run foster homes. These people get lumped together with the frauds and charlatans and its not right. And people point at them and ridicule. Let me ask you, if everyone in this world treated others as they themselves would like to be treated, wouldn&#039;t this world be a much better place?<br /><br />According to enigmacat I guess it is better to be a piece of sh*t parent, who lets their teenagers have sex, who doesn&#039;t care what time they come home or where they are at night, then to be a dreaded &quot;Conservative Christian&quot; parent. Because after all the Christian parent is being too strict and denying the teenagers freedom. <br /><br />And Christine (CHRIST-ine) I am a Christian because I believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, not because I think I am holy or better than anyone else. To be a Christian means that you accept the fact that you are a sinner, guilty before God, in rebellion against Him. That is why I need a Savior. You might be a more moral person than I am, I will admit that.Christians are not perfect, just forgiven.<br /><br />&nbsp;Maybe CHRISTine, God is calling you. Christ has been with you the whole time!

So here goes.<br /><br />The problem with Conservative Christians, the Moral Right, is that they actually feel entitled. They honestly believe that they are the only moral persons on earth and therefore they are the only ones who will ever make it to (what they call) heaven. My Granddaughter is six months old and she will be going overseas for a few months with her Mom and her other Granny to attend a wedding. But before they go, she is going to be Christened. Why? Just in case the plane goes down over the pond, the baby will NOT get into heaven! WTF is that all about? How can you possibly believe that YOUR G-d is so cruel as to not take an innocent baby to sit by His side? I had a friend who was brutally raped twenty years ago. To this day she has never told her Mother that she had to have an abortion . . . and as a result of her guilt has never returned to the Church. <br /><br />There is NO PROOF that the stories in the Bible are true. It was written hundreds of years after the alleged facts. So, who wrote the Bible? Old men who were about controlling their women and all their progeny forever. Today they would be considered a cult. <br /><br />There were religions long before Christianity. I&#039;d bet they all got into YOUR heaven without ever having heard of Jesus.

				Just finished the book. What a refreshing read. <br /><br />Christianity stakes a claim on basic human experience. Before it ever existed, humans were celebrating the Solstices and observing the patterns of the heavens before holidays were attributed to them, or even gods/goddesses. Religion was an attempt to explain the stuff that science hadn&#039;t yet figured out. <br /><br /><em>But there are true believers who have given their lives to God, who work at soup kitchens, who become missionaires and feed the poor in third world countries, who run foster homes.</em><br /><br />And nonbelievers too!! I&#039;ve devoted over 10 years volunteering at an animal shelter out east. I&#039;ve worked at soup kitchens, riding my bike into the city before dawn. Missionaries have an agenda, and while they&#039;re doing nice things, they&#039;re also spreading misinformation that is truly detrimental.<br /><br />What&#039;s scary is how religion is extreme in how it asks people to believe in unsubstantiated, archaic tales, and yet around 85% of Americans accept it as truth and morality. <br /><br />Not saying it doesn&#039;t have ANY place in society- of course it does. People congregate and get to chat with their neighbors, and do good things together. It gives people solace. But it&#039;s when it dominates and impedes scientific progress that makes it so dangerous. <br /><br />

				Ah, okay! I was worried that I was blind to the actual tone of it.<br /><br />I had gone through many book reviews on Amazon before deciding on this one. There are two others I ordered but haven&#039;t gotten to yet- forget which ones, they were sent to my in-laws&#039; house after Christmas.<br /><br />These books are a tremendous relief, and should help facilitate conversation with the family when I would normally bite my tongue (not that I want to argue every point with them; only when/if they offend me.) It&#039;s only fair that I should defend my position.

				Allow me to retort on some things here.<br /><br />&quot;They honestly believe that they are the only moral persons on earth and therefore they are the only ones who will ever make it to (what they call) heaven&quot; - NYCMacuser<br /><br />Sorry buddy but that is not why we believe we go to heaven. A Christian does not go to heaven because we are morally superior to anyone else. I am going to heaven because Jesus Christ died on the cross for my sins. It has nothing to do with &quot;morals&quot;, it has to do with forgiveness. If I believe I am going to heaven because I live a so-called &quot;moral&quot; life, then I am lying to myself and I am saying that Christ&#039;s death was useless. No, the Bible says that there are none righteous, no not even one. So get the position straight before you knock it.<br /><br />I am also sorry to hear about your friend being raped. A person in that circumstance should be allowed to have an abortion. But you throw out an extreme example, which I have heard many times, but what about the countless number of people who go out, screw anyone and everyone, gets pregnant and has an abortion? All I am saying is that you should have sex with someone you love, and if you truly love them then having a child should be a blessing. Now about the baptism thing, baptizing your child means NOTHING, that will not get you into heaven,because it is the work of a man (a priest)As I said we are all unrighteous, you must become a believer first, then you are saved and you are baptized as a symbol of becoming a new person in Christ. The actual water and oil being poured on your head means nothing. And no, God does not send innocent children to hell.<br /><br />Now Kempsternyc, listen you live your life the way you want , this is America where we are endowed by our CREATOR with certain unalienable rights. I am just arguing that the people here are demonizing Conservative Christian parents (and that is what is going on here), and I am saying that in doing so you are criticizing the way they raise their children and judging the way they live. Isn&#039;t that the exact same reason you criticize Christians, because they &quot;tell you how to live&quot;? So you see the hypocrisy in saying such things. Kempsternyc you get mad and say I took what you said out of context and then you turn around and do the same exact thing. Did I say you go whoring around? No, I did not. I simply made an argument defending Christians preaching a little sexual self control to teenagers, and comparing it to a world where no one speaks out against such things. That&#039;s all. Did you not read the part in my post where I told Christine that I admit she probably lives a more moral life than me? Or do you read what you want to read. Go by what I wrote.<br /><br />&quot;And nonbelievers too!! I&#039;ve devoted over 10 years volunteering at an animal shelter out east. I&#039;ve worked at soup kitchens, riding my bike into the city before dawn. Missionaries have an agenda,&quot; - Christine<br /><br />Oh I loved this one. I will not repeat the statement of you being more moral than I. Those are some very special things you did and you should be proud. But then look at what you do. &quot;Missionaries have an agenda&quot; That&#039;s so nice of you. So you did things out of the goodness of your heart (which I believe) but then you go and disparage the work of thousands and thousands of Christian men and women by saying they have an agenda. So when the &quot;Christians&quot; do something for the poor it is because they all, every single one of them, have an &quot;agenda&quot; but when you and other nonbelievers do it, its because it comes from the heart. Do you not realize how&nbsp; hurtful saying something like that is? So you can judge people&#039;s hearts, but if they do it to you, you get offended? How nice. <br /><br />&quot;If you hate something, don&#039;t you do it too.....&quot; Pearl Jam<br /><br />&quot;Are you just trying to say that you think Christians are more likely than others to have good morals/ethics?&quot; - Sceebs<br /><br />No Sceebs I was trying to make a distinction between alot of the fake, charlatan Christians you see alot of and the true believers who all get lumped into the same category of &quot;CHRISTIANS&quot; I am saying simply please don.t paint Christians with a broad stroke. There are many evil people out there calling themselves Christians and I want to make a distinction, that&#039;s all. I wasn&#039;t comparing believers to non-believers.<br /><br /><br />TED HAGGARD!!!!!!! - Yes he is an example of a false prophet, a wolf in sheep&#039;s clothing.<br /><br /><br />&quot;Yeah, because there are only two kinds of parents: conservative Christians, and asshole unbelievers&quot; - enigmacat<br /><br />Well you are the one disparaging and ridiculing the way Christian Conservative parents raise their children. All I am saying is: Is that so bad to raise your child with a Christian ethic?? And who are you to talk down about how people raise their kids? Being a little intolerant there, No? Telling people how they should live their lives. You are doing the very thing you claim Christians do. Hypocrisy indeed my friend. And for the record I have many, many friends who do not believe in God and are amazing parents who love their children. I do not lump all people I do not agree with into one group like you do. But you seem to have a problem with the way Christians raise their kids and you feel that they are in error, and you make your thoughts heard. <br /><br />Lastly just because you raise your child in a Christian household does not guarantee they will come out great people. I have seen examples of this with my own eyes

				According to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler&#039;s_religious_views , &quot;Hitler was raised a Catholic Christian.&quot; He turned out to be SUCH a nice guy...&nbsp; :roll:<br /><br />It also says that Stalin was an atheist, but managed to advance himself politically by pretending to be religious. So what difference does it make? <br /><br />In fact, the Bible is full of bloodshed and violence. Many religions involved human sacrifice over the centuries, to appease the gods. People will go to extremes for the sake of their God, whereas a rational atheist would scoff at the idea.<br /><br />While the USA has the largest number of citizens who consider themselves Christian, there&#039;s also the greatest disparity of salaries. The ratio b/w the highest and lowest paid workers in other countries varies, but doesn&#039;t come close to the American average of over 400:1. And what does the Bible say, something about &quot;a rich man trying to get into Heaven would have a harder time than a camel trying to pass through the eye of a needle&quot;? Talk about a hypocritical country.<br /><br />It&#039;s not about bravery, putting the ads up; it&#039;s about eliminating the ridiculous, illogical, yet widely-held belief that &quot;religion is better.&quot; Atheists simply need to be more vocal, and to stop worrying about what the religious majority thinks.<br /><br />In fact, I suspect that most religious people remain religious out of fear- bad things will happen if they stop praying or worshipping; their family will alienate them, etc. etc.<br /><br />My own family has all these snide remarks about us, wow what good people. My mother-in-law telling my husband that &quot;Satan works through him&quot; when he&#039;s one of the kindest, most patient and intelligent people I&#039;ve ever known. Her letter with some choice words about me, when all I did was allow her son to move in with me before we were engaged. I did HIM a favor. <br /><br />

				I want to take sometime and explain myself. <br /><br />As I&#039;m sure everyone who knows me on this board knows, I am gay. And that in some ways colors how I feel about religion. Yes, I do support the campaign. And the reason I do is that I want to live in a world where members of my community can live without fear. What I am about to say is not about a parishioner who attends church every week. It is bigger than that. This is about the leaders. The leaders that say we caused 9-11 or Katrina. The leaders that say we are responsible for the child molestations that have occurred in the Catholic Church. <br /><br />Buble mentioned Iran stoning homosexuals. And yes he is right. But he does not bring up the fact that gays have been bashed and even killed here in America. And I have talked about this before on this site and I will say it again. When a figure of authority attacks the gay community, it gives permission to some to go out and gay bash. In other words. If you, as a leader, stand up and declare someone evil, those hearing the message believe that the evil person can rightly be killed. <br /><br />I remember the WWJD campaign. Is there any Christian here that would say Jesus would beat up and even kill another human being? Just because he was gay? There are Christian leaders here in america that would not condemn that. And I can&#039;t help but feel that the leaders would support it. <br /><br />Let me tell you of an experience I had that I think ties into this debate. <br /><br />I was sitting on a bench in Washington Square Park eating my lunch one day. During my break, I was approached by three 20 year olds. They asked me if I believed in a personal relationship with Jesus. I told them I did not. I can&#039;t remember exactly how the conversation went...but I recall them asking why and I said that because many leader have condemned me and I really can&#039;t see a reason to be a part of a community that considers me evil. One of the girls then proceeded to apologize for the harm that I felt was done to me. Later, as I digested this experience, I wished I had asked her, Why don&#039;t you stand up and condemn this? <br /><br />This is not an attack on anybody here. This is a heartfelt observation. I really want you to understand where I am coming from. I don&#039;t hate you as a person. I hate the message I hear from the leaders of your religion. I am not a bad person. I have a good life here and I am a steady contributor to Astoria.<br /><br />But, your leaders hate me.....or, more importantly, they use me. They use me to keep themselves in power. Anyone that knows about child molestation, knows that it has NOTHING to do with being gay. <br /><br />And it hurts. It hurts more deeply that you can imagine. <br /><br />So yes, I support the campaign. Because, at the end of the day, I don&#039;t think you can bring up one true atheist (I say this because Stalin and Hitler created themselves as gods to supplant religion. In other words, they weren&#039;t true Atheists.) that has proclaimed that I am evil. Or has suggested that I am damned to Hell. But, I can bring up plenty Christians that have said so. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Indeed, not all religious people are actively hating on others, but when they support their religion, it would help if they truly understood the extent of what they&#039;re supporting. <br /><br /><em>Sam Harris may not be the best source for uninterested knowledge</em><br /><br />I haven&#039;t seen Harris do any interviews, but the tone of his book strikes me as fair and considerate.

				There is a part of me that wants to scream from the rooftops, &quot;CUT THE CRAP ALREADY!!!&quot; but I do understand that most people mean well with their beliefs. It&#039;s nearly impossible to go through a typical day without doing things that have further-reaching implications than we realize. Everything we buy, eat, etc.<br /><br />When it gums up the works of real scientific and cultural progress for no discernable reason, though, I can see why Harris *would* get angry! It&#039;s frustrating and infuriating.

				How is the ad &quot;inflicting&quot; anything? It&#039;s merely a reminder that there are plenty of atheists walking around, and they&#039;re not automatically evil. The concept of &quot;God&quot; and &quot;morality&quot; is clearly so intertwined in most people&#039;s minds, that they could use this <em>reminder.</em> It&#039;s not even a judgement. <br /><br /><em>Where does your &quot;instinct&quot; come from, and how do we as a society trust this instinct to be upheld as a standard of &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;? </em> <br /><br />Common sense, upbringing, law, and society. Like I mentioned before, even primates instinctively understand right from wrong, so it&#039;s not necessary to chisel in stone and whack people over the head with it.<br /><br />Those of you who are religious: If suddenly there were proof that God does not exist, would you automatically become lawless and immoral? Of course not- the short-term gains are not worth the repercussions. So why would a godless atheist? It&#039;s just impractical.<br /><br />People who practice other religions feel as strongly you Christians do. At the core of all religions is a desire for basic morality. There&#039;s constant disagreement as to which book is right- the Old Testament? The New Testament? The Koran? Why not just eliminate the pretense and just Do No Harm?

				I appreciate reading everyone&#039;s sharing of their believe and religion on here...believers and non-believers alike, rather you are Christian or not, an atheist or believer, you are holding by FAITH a set of believes and principles. <br />Since everyone is so open and generous to share, I am privileged with the opportunity to share my faith as well, I&#039;m a Christian what does that mean? &nbsp;It means first and foremost, to quote John Newton, &quot;I am a great sinner and Christ is a great Savior&quot;. It means that I am saved by grace and no amount of good works will entitle me a ticket to Heaven. It means my best human efforts to be a moral and just person falls short of the glory of God, I am justified and cleansed by the blood of Christ on the cross. It means I am to follow Christ&#039;s commandments to love God with all my heart and love others as myself (Mark 12:28-30), regardless if others return that love or not. It means to forgive others as God has forgiven me. It means that I am to show the same mercy to others as God has shown to me. It means that I don&#039;t take God&#039;s forgiveness for granted ( John 8:11). It means that God loved me before I loved Him and He pursued me before I opened my life to Him. It means I have been shown the magnitude of God&#039;s love (John 3:16). It means that I strive to see others through the eyes of God. It means I may be judge and hated for who I am, but I am to respond with love nevertheless (John 15: 18). <br /><br />Being a Christian doesn&#039;t mean that I was born into a household with Christian parents nor entitled in anyway.

Just as there were many who were appalled at Him.

In Catholicism, the baby doesn&#039;t go to heaven, since it&#039;s still tainted by original sin which we are all born with (DAMMIT EVE, wtf dude.)

I&#039;m of the school of &quot;be good to each other, and life will work itself out.&quot;<br /><br />* I do have to say there was one awesome priest in my life who, when I questioned something in a bible story at age 8ish, was like &quot;well, when they wrote this 2,000 years ago, this is how they understood the world. They are really just stories to teach us how to be good to each other, you don&#039;t have to take them so literally. Just take the lessons from them.&quot; Most of the lessons I was taught from religion as a kid were &quot;don&#039;t be a jerk&quot; so that sounds ok to me.

I had this same question in my mind years ago when I was a new believer, I thank a good friend of mine who forwarded this well written article to me regarding the subject matter which sums up this issue:<br /><br />Do all babies who die go to heaven? Or has God predestined some for heaven, while the rest go to hell? Does the Bible address this issue at all or do we just hope that they go to heaven to comfort ourselves? First we must note that the Bible says God will judge all people,&nbsp; so this must include babies and young children. How does God judge between one baby and another? Does He judge by how much they cry or spit up?&nbsp; Since God is omniscient (all knowing), does He judge on the basis of what they would have done had they lived an entire life? This would seem to be a perplexing problem and the Bible does not describe anywhere how God would judge a baby. Or does it? Making matters worse, is the fact that the Bible says all people are sinners. In fact, the Bible specifically states that people are sinners from their birth, so this obviously includes babies. The Bible also indicates that those who sin and don&#039;t accept Jesus as their Savior are judged5 and sentenced to death - the so-called &quot;second death,&quot; which is hell. So, do all babies and children who haven&#039;t accepted Jesus as Savior go to hell. The Bible makes it clear that people are condemned to hell on the basis of their sins and their rejection of Jesus Christ as the remedy for their sinful condition. However, infants and young children are incapable of fully understanding either their spiritual condition or God&#039;s requirements for salvation. Can God judge them even though they don&#039;t understand the basis of that judgment? The Bible does indicate that children are innocent, for example, when describing how some of the Israelites in the Valley of Benhinnom had become corrupt so as to sacrifice their own (innocent) children: &quot;Because they have forsaken Me and have made this an alien place and have burned sacrifices in it to other gods, that neither they nor their forefathers nor the kings of Judah had ever known, and because they have filled this place with the blood of the innocent and have built the high places of Baal to burn their sons in the fire as burnt offerings to Baal, a thing which I never commanded or spoke of, nor did it ever enter My mind; (Jeremiah 19:4-5) The Bible also indicates that children are regarded as being innocent because of their lack of ability to discern between good and evil: Moreover, your little ones who you said would become a prey, and your sons, who this day have no knowledge of good or evil, shall enter there, and I will give it to them and they shall possess it. (Deuteronomy 1:39). Other verses also indicate that young children are not fully capable of making moral choices. So, the Bible says that babies and children are innocent, based upon their inability to fully understand the difference between good and evil. Do babies go to heaven? So, since babies and children are considered innocent, one would assume that they would be excluded from judgment and get a pass to heaven. However, does the Bible explicitly state what happens to them? A verse from Job says that they enter into rest: &quot;Or like a miscarriage which is discarded, I would not be, As infants that never saw light. There the wicked cease from raging, And there the weary are at rest. (Job 3:16-17) Likewise, another verse suggests that a person who is not satisfied with their life is worse off than one who is miscarried. Although it does not explicitly state what happens to the miscarried, the assumption would be that they went to heaven. Both the Old and New Testaments indicate that God has a special relationship with children. In the book of Ezekiel, God was very upset with His people as they were sacrificing their children to idols. However, God calls them &quot;My children&quot;: &quot;Moreover, you took your sons and daughters whom you had borne to Me and sacrificed them to idols to be devoured. Were your harlotries so small a matter? You slaughtered My children and offered them up to idols by causing them to pass through the fire.&quot; (Ezekiel 16:20-21) Jesus indicated that people who enter heaven are like children, implying that children go to heaven. And He called a child to Himself and set him before them, and said, &quot;Truly I say to you, unless you are converted and become like children, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.&quot; (Matthew 18:2-3) Then some children were brought to Him so that He might lay His hands on them and pray; and the disciples rebuked them. But Jesus said, &quot;Let the children alone, and do not hinder them from coming to Me; for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.&quot; (Matthew 19:13-14) So, the Bible indicates quite clearly that children who die go to heaven. However, the question remains at what age an individual ceases to be a child. So, we know that babies and children go to heaven when they die. However, we don&#039;t know what the cutoff is for those who die young. Is it 5, or 8,or 12 years old? The Bible makes no mention of any kind of &quot;age of accountability.&quot; So, it is quite likely that there is no specific age at which an individual become accountable. Our three sons all accepted Jesus as their Savior around five years old. However, they had been exposed to the gospel message since birth, and had gone to Sunday School, Bible studies, vacation Bible schools, and Awana in their early years. We never asked them if they wanted to be Christians, but allowed them to ask the question on their own. Five years old is probably not the average age at which children are capable of understanding the gospel and responding to it. Having taught vacation Bible school and Sunday school for many years, I recognize that the average first grader is not taking in the information and processing it for how it applies to him. However, when the time comes, one can see the light come on. In one of the vacation Bible school assemblies, I recall a group of boys (probably around 10 years old) who were in attendance as a gospel presentation was being made. One of the boys suddenly said to the others, &quot;Did you hear what she said?,&quot; in an excited voice. An alter call had been made, and he dashed up to the front. His friends were left sitting in the pew. So, I have seen many children at many different levels of spiritual and physical development, which must be the basis by which God determines if they are accountable. For those with mental disabilities, it is possible that they never become morally accountable. However, we can be assured that God judges all people, including children, fairly. Some denominations baptize their infants in the belief that such baptism prevents them from going to hell should they die before coming to faith in Christ. However, what about babies who are miscarried or die during childbirth? Are they condemned to hell? That is what the doctrine of infant baptism would imply. So, the doctrine of infant baptism changes salvation from one of grace to one of works, since infant baptism is a work of the parent, and not a work of God. As such, the practice of infant baptism displays a lack in trust of God as the bearer of salvation, so must be rejected as being an efficacious act. So, being baptized as an infant saves neither an infant nor an adult. Salvation is still a gift of God based upon the grace of God. Biblical baptism is the public confession of faith by an accountable individual.So, we reject infant baptism as being required for the salvation of babies and young children who die. Babies and young children who die go the heaven through the grace and righteous judgment of God. The Bible is clear that those who are not fully capable of making moral choices are declared to be innocent, and, therefore, worthy of heaven. The Bible does not mention any kind of &quot;age of accountability,&quot; but bases accountability on the basis of the ability to make moral choices. Infant baptism, although it shows a commitment from the parent, is neither required nor efficacious in obtaining salvation for little ones. The salvation of babies and children is a gift of God, based upon His grace, and cannot be purchased through a work of a parent. If you have lost an infant or child, we pray that the Lord would comfort you with His grace, and that you would desire to join your child in heaven through a confession of faith in Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior. May God bless you.

It is true that fallen human beings have used religions as masks to inflict violence upon one another.

Oh and let&#039;s not forget the tip of the iceberg, the French Revolution, viva to human reason and morte to religion. Remove the idea of God in a society and human beings will put their faith in something else to appear morally and spiritually superior, be it the Country, State, race, culture, gender, class, and the list goes on.

They are really just stories to teach us how to be good to each other, you don&#039;t have to take them so literally. Just take the lessons from them.&quot; Most of the lessons I was taught from religion as a kid were &quot;don&#039;t be a jerk&quot; so that sounds ok to me. (I won&#039;t say his name because he is still a priest and still awesome.)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That&#039;s exactly how my old Unitarian minister left Catholicism as well.&nbsp; At age 9 she loved the church and its pageantry, but she didn&#039;t understand why she couldn&#039;t be part of the service while her brothers, who didn&#039;t like their alter boy jobs, could.&nbsp; When the priest told her that it just wasn&#039;t her place, she turned her back on the Church from that day forward.&nbsp; <br /><br />Apparently, they now allow girls to be alter boys, but they now call them acolytes.&nbsp; And interestingly, at my fiance&#039;s parent&#039;s church, the acolytes are made up of almost all girls.&nbsp; <br /><br />Yeah, to me that&#039;s just indicative of the odd paradox of the Catholic Church.&nbsp; Men have all the power, but it&#039;s generally the women who are the ones who keep their pews full.<br /><br />I&#039;m agnostic, but I very much support the subway Atheist campaign.&nbsp; To say that it&#039;s inflicting a belief on subway riders is ridiculous.&nbsp; That&#039;s like me saying that Christians are inflicting their beliefs on me every time I see a giant cross on a hillside.&nbsp; All it does is (needlessly) remind me that there are Christians out there.&nbsp; <br /><br />

Do you agree with his other findings that men are smarter than women? Wow how very inclusive and open to all ideas you are!<br /><br />So whats up Mer, you agree with that study too? Men smarter than women? In your attempt to try to ridicule Christians and their IQs, you make yourself look foolish citing sources that have made outrageous comments before. <br /><br />That is so nice, the very people who hate Christians because they say Christians feel &quot;superior&quot; and talk down to people are the same ones who post some mickey mouse study trying to say how intellectually superior atheists are to Christians. <br /><br />Again the hipcrosy is showing its ugly head...<br /><br />&quot;If you hate something, don&#039;t you do it too....&quot; Pearl Jam

In all honesty, I would and have read St John of the Cross and Teresa of Avila. In fact, because of this thread, I have added to my pile of books to read, &quot;The Cloud of Unknowing&quot; I get the journey and have, at times, wished I could take that Journey....but alas, it is not to be. <br /><br />What I don&#039;t get is a bunch of people believing in a few scrolls that tell them of a world that is absolute. And taking that journey in such absolute terms that seem, to me, to limit that journey. <br /><br />I think St John of the Cross got closer to what Jesus was talking about. One example I will give you is this, Jesus said that a rich man has a greater chance of getting to heaven then a camel has of getting through the eye of the needle. <br /><br />A rich man is held to his riches and cannot begin the true journey to god. His possessions matter more to him. <br /><br />If you want to get closer to god, don&#039;t worry about me. Instead, lock yourself into a dark closet and think. Take that journey. No bible will lead you there. No ten commandments will lead you there. No Cathedral will lead you there. You worrying about me screwing my boyfriend will not lead you there.<br /><br />What Jesus was talking about was letting go. Letting your soul travel through space and time. Put down the bible. Remember when Jesus intervened when his disciples were gathering grain. <br /><strong>1At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry and began to pick some heads of grain and eat them. 2When the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, “Look! Your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath.”<br /><br />3He answered, “Haven’t you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry? 4He entered the house of God, and he and his companions ate the consecrated bread—which was not lawful for them to do, but only for the priests. 5Or haven’t you read in the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple desecrate the day and yet are innocent? 6I tell you that onea greater than the temple is here. 7If you had known what these words mean, ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice,’b you would not have condemned the innocent. 8For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.”</strong><br /><br />Many read this as Jesus is the lord of the Sabbath. I read this as a condemnation of the rules of the Pharisees. They were the Rulers, the ones, such as Pat Robertson, that condemned me, But truly didn&#039;t understand a spiritual life. <br /><br />Or, to put it another way, <br /><br />Jesus said, f___ the rules. <br /><br />I will close with this. St John of the Cross got it. He pretty much had sex with God in &quot;A dark night of the soul&quot;. Not in a physical way....but in a spiritual way. <br /><br />If you want to talk to me about god, talk to me in a way that makes sense. Taking that ultimate journey doesn&#039;t require a book, It requires your mind being open. And if anyone here thinks I am talking about Christians; please understand that I am also talking about myself. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
