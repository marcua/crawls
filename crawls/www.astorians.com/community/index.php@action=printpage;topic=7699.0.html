				Yes, isn&#039;t it glorious. It&#039;s one thing if he were a gay man and didn&#039;t want to reveal it, but <em><strong>anonymous </strong> </em> partners in an airport bathroom? Come on, sir! Why not just shoot yourself up with the HIV.......The hypocrisy of DC (and especially the GOP) knows no bounds.

				Prostitution should be made legal and then the police can leave citizens alone and concentrate on walking the beat, busting up drug rings and the like.&nbsp; Though I do not care for Craig&#039;s politics, I do not revel in him getting caught and arrested in such a manner.

				I must do confess that I do find it amusing when someone is hoisted by their own petard. These guys are incredible! They both are moral majority self rightous perveyors of family values, with an obsessive compulsion to pry into the private lives and bedrooms of consenting adults. Yet they are both caught in perverted illegal and unsafe anonymus sexual crimes in public places. What hypocrisy ! They deserve to be rideculed and laughed out of office. When Leno, Lettermanand Conan and all joke about them I will be right there laughing along singing Nah Nah Nah Na - Nah Nah Nah Na - Hey Hey Goodbye. :roll:

				I&#039;m sorry but if they were caught and then fessed up like McGreavy or George Michael and told of their personal torment and fears that would be one thing. But when one calls a press conference takes no questions and&nbsp; whose whole emphasis is not about the circumstances or the charges - but just to deny the fact that he was GAY! Like that was the charge against him and the thing to fear -not that he was caught in public in a lewed act!&nbsp; <br /><br />And the other numbnick - whose excusal is that there were blacks there - and so he was in fear - only exposes himself as being racist as well as homophobic. This takes away any sense of pity I have for these pious perverts prying into peoples private lives while&nbsp; publically crying out about moral values and ethics. <br /><br />Laughter is the best medicine, as otherwise I would puke.<br />

				The best part of this whole story, when you ignore the anonymous sex in bathrooms and the anti-gay-pro-&quot;family values&quot; and all that hypocrisy, though, is the &quot;I have a wide stance!&quot; explanation. I can&#039;t stop cracking up.

				I LOVE IT!<br /><br />Especially this part:<br />… Craig began tapping his right foot, touched his right foot to the left foot of the officer and brushed his hand beneath the partition between them. He was then arrested.<br /><br />And I thought this was the international symbol for “f-ck help me there’s no tp”.<br /><br /><br />I’m sorry, if Larry Craig was simply a closeted homo and was outed by the press or a political opponent, then perhaps I’d have a measure of sympathy for him – even with his anti-gay stance.<br /><br />But that was not the case. Craig put himself in harm’s way, no one else. He was busted in a public bathroom cruising for sex, which to me indicates he gets his kicks from the thrill of danger. He was certainly kicked this time around.<br /><br />Spare me the excuses about how rough it may have been for him, that he was probably tortured by his double-existence and public sex was the only outlet. I assume he has an internet connection so this is pure b-s.<br /><br />Given the rumors about his sexual practices (I refrain from using the word sexuality) over the years you can say he’s enjoyed a fair amount of protection – as one would expect of a US senator – in fact he showed the officer his Senate ID card! but it looks like his trusted get-out-jail free card has expired. <br /><br />I don’t hold politicians to a higher standard than anyone else. I hold them to their word and I don’t like politicians, especially Republicans, who espouse and are elected on ‘family-values’, which in fact holds other people to a higher standard and then go off to get their jollies -- in bathrooms, bars, boardrooms, whorehouses, casinos or stock market -- pick your favorite sin.<br />

				Craig has been a very consistent vote against the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.&nbsp; I feel bad that he has problems coming to terms with his sexual orientation - I understand that coming out in Idaho, and staying active in Republican politics is probably not a viable option for him, not to mention how it will complicate his life with his poor wife (I feel much worse for her than for him).&nbsp; Personally I do not think finding sexual partners in bathrooms is a good idea for folks of any sexual orientation.&nbsp; <br />I find the entire situation sad - the rank hypocrisy of so many elected officials is just amazing.<br />Pams House Blend has been doing some great coverage of these situations.<br />http://www.pamshouseblend.com/frontPage.do <br />and there is an interesting take on it at Room 8.<br />http://www.r8ny.com/

				This whole situation has seemed really bizarre to me, ever since I first heard about it. I mean...okay, well, I can&#039;t claim to know all about mens&#039; restroom habits, but his behavior seems kind of bizarre. I wouldn&#039;t think of those actions as cruising for sex, necessarily, but I am not a gay male. Then, when he&#039;s confronted, he CONFESSES--pleads guilty, pays a fine, says both that he did something he knew or should have known was engaging in lewd behavior (I forget the wording, but &quot;knew or should have known&quot; was definitely in there) AND that he will not later plead innocent of the charge, which is exactly what he&#039;s doing now. I&#039;m sorry--I don&#039;t know a single straight male in my life who would a) likely know that those actions were a code for cruising, b) if they did know, would actually MAKE any of those actions, c) if they didn&#039;t know and accidentally made those actions, ADMIT the actions and pay a fine, especially if they were in a public office. They would be protesting their wide stance or whatever and would almost go overboard in exclaiming their hetero-ness. <br /><br />So, I must assume that the senator is, in fact, a closeted, self-hating gay male (self-hating determined by the legislation he&#039;s pushing so hard for). <br /><br />However, what I find really abhorrent is the public&#039;s reaction to it. In general, the last several years, I&#039;ve noticed that when elected officials do things that are either against the law or the public find abhorrent in general, people do a lot of talking but no one demands anything be done. What&#039;s wrong with the public that we can&#039;t stand up and say, &quot;Hey, what you did as an elected official was wrong. You were speeding/doing drugs/laundering money/employing illegal immigrants/cruising for sex/cheating on your wife* <em>in defiance of</em> what you say you stand for. I do not want you representing me any more, you&#039;re fired!&quot;&nbsp; I don&#039;t believe that it&#039;s because the split is 50/50 or that most people don&#039;t mind that the politician was doing something wrong, but because we see corruption in government as so ubiquitous we feel helpless to do anything about it. I mean, seriously--if the public called for it, COULD we even fire our own representatives? (Aside from impeachment for the president, I&#039;m not sure I&#039;ve ever heard of it. Only that elected officials sometimes resign for various reasons, most of which boil down to &quot;people don&#039;t like me anymore&quot;). <br /><br />*I should note that my politics are not showing here, as there are a number of these instances and others that I don&#039;t care much about and/or don&#039;t think should be illegal in the first place. However, an elected official should be held to a higher legal standard than the average Joe, even (or especially) regarding common laws like speeding or basic societal courtesies like cheating on your spouse. And when politicians fight for particular regulations, I think they should be held to an even higher standard. If we don&#039;t like the laws and don&#039;t want to hold either average citizens or elected officials to them, get them off the books!<br /><br />I hate that we have placed celebrities in higher positions of esteem than those we elect to govern us.

I sure as hell had no idea.<br />Secondly in his press conference he never said that he wasn&#039;t bi (think about that one)<br />Last thing all this republican senators are jumping up and down trying to get him to resign because they know he is gay.<br />In washington everybody knows each others &nbsp;sexual habits and if they want him out its probably because he was caught by senate security before.

				My reaction to this overlaps significantly with Frappe&#039;s, but I&#039;ll comment because I have a slightly different take and emphasis. <br /><br />Frappe, when you describe and reiterate the karmic rationale for Democrats not celebrating this particular senator&#039;s downfall, you do a disservice to your main point, which is THE point: the govt. is doing things it shouldn&#039;t, those things endanger the liberties all of us depend on, we really need to get the govt. out of the sex-monitoring business. <br /><br />That one person receives a single taxpayer dollar to prevent consenting adults from seeking sex with other consenting adults is abominable, morally reprehensible, outrageous, unconstitutional, and unAmerican in the truest sense of the word. Infuriating, on principle. <br /><br />That any citizen of a country born of a principled and intransigent revolt against illegitimate use of government power is eager to exploit the results of this sting operation is positively Orwellian.<br /><br />Sure, a person could say that, one the one hand, the flagrant hypocrisy of a gay sex seeking senator fighting against gay-friendly public policy reform is irresistible fist-pumping fodder. On the other hand, the same person could simultaneously hold that the government really is wasting valuable resources and, by the way, undermining our liberty by intruding in a fellow citizen&#039;s sexual behavior. But what do people choose to emphasize?<br /><br />What I hear from left of center folks about this case is pure and simple delight. They&#039;re relishing every moment. Rarely I hear a grudging, eye-rolling nod to the idea that maybe our government shouldn&#039;t be doing this kind of thing. The same Left capable of defending a Nazi&#039;s First Amendment rights celebrates law enforcement&#039;s &quot;work up&quot; of this sexually repressed schmuck? Hmmm. Hypocrisy?<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard more than one person remark that there&#039;s something especially fulfilling about Republican&#039;s being outed as <strong>hypocrites</strong> when it comes to sexuality issues. <br /><br />I am especially disturbed when Democrats, who generally prize their reputation as members of a more reasonable, more scientific, more empirically grounded group, eschew data about the abject failure of central planning of the economy as they trumpet their advocacy of free lunch programs. There is something abominable, morally reprehensible... just mind-boggling infuriating about the Left&#039;s blind faith in government. <br /><br />If it&#039;s pathetic that three of the Republican presidential candidates don&#039;t &quot;believe&quot; in evolution, it&#039;s pathetic that all of the Democratic presidential candidates recommend centrally planned socialistic solutions after the historical record or the 20th century and despite contemporary economic theories (see Public Choice, see Experimental Economics, see Hayek and von Mises, see Julian Simon, etc.). <br /><br />When I hear people talk about the Democrats as the party of civil liberties, I imagine what it would be like to be in prison for the nonviolent crime of drug use/possession/trading and to believe that my champions are the current leadership of the Democratic Party. Ouch.

They don’t. In Craig’s case the sex-angle is integral, in Clinton’s it’s incidental. <br /><br />Clinton’s case the discussion is always framed around sex and lying but wasn’t it really a coup d’etat attempt by the Republican party at to remove a democratically-elected Democratic president from office?<br /><br />In 1996 the Republicans were livid that Clinton was re-elected. So “they” systematically set out to take him down. Everyone goofs on Hilary and her “right-wing” conspiracy theory but she had a point. Clinton was mid-way through his second-term. He couldn’t be elected again so what was the purpose? To discredit him? That was accomplished by the scandal itself. The impeachment of Clinton was a travesty, not because of what was done to poor ol’ Bill but what was done to the American people. <br /><br />Bill Clinton was no angel. We all knew it when we elected him to represent us as our president the first time in 1992 and we still knew it when we elected him again in 1996.<br /><br />Clinton never positioned himself as a paragon of ‘family-values’ or moral virtue, especially where sex was concerned. You can even make the argument that his flaws or transgressions were one of the things that endeared him to so many.<br /><br />I harp on hypocritical Republicans because it is the Republicans who portray themselves as the party of moral virtue and when they push for social legislation such as the Defense of Marriage Act and then cavort in public restrooms cruising for sex, serve divorce papers on their wives as they lay in a hospital bed, or set up foundations and write books expounding Conservative moral superiority while at the same time loose millions in Las Vegas casinos, it makes me livid.<br /><br />But I&#039;ll be fair and agree that Clinton’s judgement may have been clouded by his sexual practices. Afterall, it was President William Jefferson Clinton who signed the Defense of Marriage Act into law -- but I forgive him.<br />

Larry Craig, and for the Republican leadership&#039;s response - and they&#039;re not very flattering. <br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />The whole story of Senator Larry Craig, the Republican of Idaho who announced his resignation yesterday, is a nightmare of out-of-control police and weak politicians. <br /><br />Senator Craig has been the innocent victim of a set-up by the evil-minded police of Minneapolis-St. Paul that Stalin would have admired. <br /><br />Here&#039;s the deal: Senator Craig went into a men&#039;s room at the Twin Cities airport. He entered a lavatory stall. He tapped his foot. He may or may not have reached his hand down under the lavatory partition to pick up a piece of paper or to make a signal. <br /><br />That&#039;s it. That&#039;s the whole thing. There was no sex act of any kind. <br /><br />So the policeman who happened to be in the next stall walks Senator Craig off, starts bullying him, accusing him of lying and, implicitly, threatens to ruin Senator Craig&#039;s career. <br /><br />ALL FOR A MAN TAPPING HIS FOOT IN A PUBLIC BATHROOM. <br /><br />This is insane. <br /><br />If a police officer can wreck a man&#039;s career over this trifle, then we might as well not have a Constitution or a Bill of Rights. <br /><br />Look, I spend a lot of time in Idaho. These are good people. I can readily see why a Senator from there would quietly plead guilty to a small charge rather than risk a public fight - even though the police seem to have wrecked Craig&#039;s career anyway. <br /><br />What I don&#039;t understand is why the GOP is tossing Senator Craig overboard as if he were a terrorist. <br /><br />Even if it turns Senator Craig is gay, so what? Barney Frank is gay and he&#039;s one of the best members of the Congress. There are lots of fine gay public servants. <br /><br />Senator Craig has been the victim of a police lynching. A party that believes in individual rights should be rallying to his defense, not making him walk the plank. <br /><br />Shame on the GOP leadership, and utter disgrace to the airport police and their thug behavior. <br /><br />These are security people in airports. Hello! <strong>An airport? Don&#039;t they have anything better to do?</strong><br /><br />(http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/dayart/movies/41007/41007_ab.jpg)<br /><br />

				First off you should hear the transcript of the interrogation between the officer and Craig.<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWjXedX7pLA (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWjXedX7pLA)<br /><br />Second, if anybody believes that a person who&#160; (a) peeks through the stall door, (b) presses your foot against yours from the adjacent stall, (c) keeps tapping his foot, and (d) reaches under the stall wall with his opposite hand and make some notion with his hand, is not trying to solicite sex, then they are either oblivious or apologists. <br /><br />Third, Ben Stein was a lawyer and speechwriter for President Richard Nixon, and has frequently appeared on talk shows as a right wing pundit to put his spin on facts and defend the indefensable. I did enjoy his game show though, Win Ben Stein&#039;s Money.<br /><br />Fourth, Senator Larry Craig is a moral crusader who has a platform against &quot;immorality&quot; such as adultery and gay rights. He was on Meet The Press in 1999 to speak out against then President Bill Clinton&#039;s affair with Monica Lewinsky, and to state his opinion that he felt Clinton was only getting a slap on the wrist for his actions. His words and phrasing is downright creepy, and in retrospect highly hypocrtitical and amusing. Here&#039;s the link to the video:<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lvMYgIAAkk (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lvMYgIAAkk)<br /><br />Five, he pleaded guilty instead of fighting the charge. Come on, if you were accused of soliciting gay sex in a public men&#039;s bathroom, and you were innocent, would you pleade guilty? Especially if you are a high elected official such as a senator? Wouldn&#039;t you fight it to your death? I know I would.<br /><br />From what I&#039;ve noticed over the years, those who bark the loudest about having a moral highground, are most likely to be the &quot;nasty, bad, naughty boys&quot; with skeletons in their closets.
