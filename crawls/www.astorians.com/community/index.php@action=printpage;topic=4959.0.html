				The article, and the associated links, were pretty sparse in information, sparse enough for me to be uncomfortable to form an opinion yet.&nbsp; How is this directive out of control, or Orwellian, or upsetting the checks and balances?&nbsp; Was it such when Clinton introduced the directive?<br /><br />I&#39;m a fan of market self correction.

				Putting political appointees as overseers for a department instead of experienced professionals who are already in charge is a too much.&nbsp; They are there to control how and what comes out of those departments.&nbsp; Sort of like Russia of old when the Politiboro would have a man on each naval vessel to over see the commander. Same thing in all Russian agencies.&nbsp; MAke sure people stay in line.<br /><br />Bush did this already with the National weather service after Katrina. The service cannot issue warnings without White house review.&nbsp; And look at how our scientists are being bullied into down playing global warming reports.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#39;s just another example of team Bush securing power in the Executive branch.

				I&#39;m not sure if I interpreted this correctly, but are we saying that as an elected official we should trust the decisions made and the addition of liasons in various non-government organizations?

				I would simply say that when a politician with such blatant agenda and history starts expanding the exec branch and finds ways to control and influence federal agencies, we have a problem.<br /><br />And I do believe the civil service has its place. Expert professional people doing work in their fields is a good thing.&nbsp; A politician may be expert and nothing more than charm and speaking abilities.
