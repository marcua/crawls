				We usually use the dry cleaner on 30th Avenue and 35th Street -- next to the pizzeria. We both wear suits to work, so we drop off A LOT of dry cleaning -- spending probably about $200/month if not more. We&#039;ve been going there for years -- they haven&#039;t been the greatest, they&#039;re overpriced, and will make an occasional mistake with the bill (which we usually catch), but we&#039;ve never had any serious problems with them.<br /><br />Until today.<br /><br />A couple of weeks ago we brought in a ton of stuff -- had pants tailored, sweaters dry cleaned, suits cleaned, etc. Today I go to get out one of the sweaters, which was folded neatly on a hanger, only to find that the entire back of the sweater (the part that was folded) was completely torn to shreds!!! Had they told me there was an accident during the cleaning, apologized, offered to make restitution, that&#039;s fine. But they HID it! There was no way that whoever folded it onto the hanger didn&#039;t notice this -- they were clearly covering it up.<br /><br />So now they&#039;ve lost us as customers, and I would implore people to think twice about using a place that has such shady business practices. I can understand that accidents happen, but covering it up is just sleazy, sleazy, sleazy.

				Just wondering, did you take that sweater back to them and give them an opportunity to make is right—not the sweater, of course—the replacement cost of the sweater? The folding might have been done by an employee who was fearful of losing their job and did it to cover up their mistake.

				This is why I check all my stuff before I leave the drycleaners. I use Minerva on Broadway and I&#039;ve had<br />several instances with them where I request that pants be creased and it&#039;s not done. Now before I pay I check<br />everything to be sure. I realize that&#039;s hard if you have a lot of stuff, but better to discover something like that<br />before you leave than after—gives you the upper hand when making a damage claim.<br /><br />I would go back though and show them and see how they react. It may well have been someone else trying to<br />cover themself or their co-worker. Usually when I see finished drycleaning being brought into Minerva, they wheel<br />it in on a rack with seveal things on it at once. I don&#039;t think the attendants have the time to individually check the<br />garments so your person there may honestly not have seen the damage.<br /><br />If it&#039;s possible—if you still have it—bring the receipt for the sweater in case it&#039;s new. That gives you more backup.<br /><br />On the other hand, I feel for you. Such an aggravating thing to have happen when you trust a business. <br /><br />Good luck.<br />

				Good luck trying to get restitution or an apology.&nbsp; Depends on whether they really care about their business.&nbsp; <br /><br />I used to go to the dry cleaners on 24 avenue between 28 and 27 Street.&nbsp; They lost the pants to one of my suits. My wife reported it right away when she got home and they said that they would turn up in a couple of days.&nbsp; A month and a half later, they still hadn&#039;t turned up.&nbsp; I brought the receipt in and they offered restitution initially until I came to collect the money.&nbsp; They didn&#039;t want to pay, they accused me of lying to get a free suit and called me every name in the book.&nbsp; I finally got half the money from them after arguing for an hour.&nbsp; Two weeks later the pants showed up at their shop and they called me to let me know.&nbsp; The owners kept their heads down when I came to pick it up.&nbsp; I wave to them every time I go to the dry cleaners up the block on the corner of 27th street. <br /><br />My point is that some of these shops don&#039;t care about losing a customer as long as they don&#039;t have to lay out any money.&nbsp; If they already tried to hide it once, just be prepared for a small argument when you go to get restitution.<br /><br />Good luck.

Never again. They melted and cracked my buttons, I had inexplicable stains on my garments (such as one of my white shirts being covered in blue ink stains!) that weren&#039;t there before I dropped it off, and it was overpriced to boot. I still haven&#039;t found a decent dry cleaners in the area. I usually just get my garments dry cleaned now when I go out of town because there isn&#039;t one that&#039;s acceptable near me. Let me know if you find another in the area that you actually like.

				If they truly settled you&#039;re problem as you stated, why do you still harbor ill will towards them? Everyone makes mistakes which they&#039;re sometimes not proud of, I say give them a second chance.
