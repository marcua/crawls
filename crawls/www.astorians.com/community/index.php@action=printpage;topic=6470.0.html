				Apparently the the LED bulb atop the Pavilon Tower at Flushing Meadows blew out and will cost $45k to replace.&nbsp; Its not that LED bulbs are that pricey.<br /><br />It&#039;s bc after 40 years of neglect, the interior stairs of the tower have been worn away by bird poop.. Yup...<br /><br />So, the Parks commission has had to hire &quot;Vertical Access&quot; a company that scales buildings and monuments as if they were Everest herself.<br /><br /><br />http://www.queenstribune.com/news/1180036399.html

				What a waste.&nbsp; I wonder what the cost would have been to tear it down?&nbsp; It&#039;s nothing but a rusted, rotted eyesore.&nbsp;

				I wonder how much it would have cost to maintain the struture to begin with. This was a building deliberately left to stay after the 64/65 Worlds Fair. In Montreal&nbsp; and other cities - old world fair pavillions and areas are beautiful exposition centers. Here in NY - especially in Queens our dismal leaders left things to rot. There were so many beautiful fountain like the huge Fountain of the Planets with its dancing waters and lights. It now looks like the diving pool in Astoria - another great project left to rot.

				The World&#039;s Fair structures were designed as temporary installations, and are living on borrowed time so to speak. There are those who wish to preserve it and those who wish to demolish it- seems about evenly divided. <br /><br />It&#039;s been nominated as one of the top 100 most endangered national landmarks in the country, among other things, so it looks like it may have money coming its way for preservation one way or another.

				I also thought it was meant to be temporary.&nbsp; A landmark?&nbsp; I guess it is.&nbsp; Who can miss it?&nbsp; It&#039;s not like a space needle or a place that would ever draw tourists.&nbsp; It&#039;s a senseless platform on a pole.&nbsp; What could they do - a restaurant?&nbsp; They saved Terrace on the Park and the Hall of Science.&nbsp; I say we call it day and tear this down once and for all.&nbsp; Before it falls down and someone gets hurt.&nbsp; Or worse, it becomes someone&#039;s pet project and millions of dollars get sunk trying to &quot;save&quot; it.&nbsp;

				Yeah, Terrace on the Park is monstrous, I&#039;m amazed that it&#039;s economically viable.....sure it&#039;s an expensive place to have a party, but still amazing they can use that structure.

				http://www.terraceonthepark.com/ (http://www.terraceonthepark.com/)<br />&nbsp;Terrace on the park is still having weddings. It used to be THE PLACE in the late 70&#039;s-90&#039;s, and I have worked there as well. Actually it is a pain to get to, especially during the baseball season. But truthfully, even though it is an ugly building outside and gaudy inside , you can&#039;t beat the view.
