				I&#39;m sorry you guys had a bad experience. Anything in particular you&#39;d like to comment on? or was it generally not a good time. Also how long ago did you visit? we&#39;ve had some changes to staff and head chef. Please let us know. :-(

				We&#39;ve also had some great Zagat reviews and even people who when they 1st came around didn&#39;t have a great experience and with all the positive feedback they got from friends and associates gave it a 2nd try and hada much better time. check out other forums like Queens west .com or simply google us and see for yourself.&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />http://www.queenswest.com/neighborhood/discussion/00004782<br /><br />http://www.realityimpaired.net/rest/14/

The food was so-so and was cold. My friend finished her meal by the time they brought me out my new warm meal. We didn&#39;t even order off the Restaurant Week menu since it was cheaper to order a la carte. When did the head chef and staff change hands? I would be willing to give it another try.
