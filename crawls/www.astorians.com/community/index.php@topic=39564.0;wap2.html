			<strong>Starwind51</strong>:
			<br />
			<br />Suggestions please:<br /><br />If you were sending a present to somebody, what would you choose that represents any of the following?<br /><br /><br />Astoria<br />New York City<br />New York State<br />The USA<br /><br /><br />Since the present would be sent long distance, not handed to the person directly near here, &quot;baklava&quot;, an MTA card, NYS&#039;s official snack (yogurt), and apple pie wouldn&#039;t be useful choices, as well as anything made in another country, such as a model of the Statue of Liberty if it&#039;s made in China.&nbsp; Age and gender of recipient are not a factor.
