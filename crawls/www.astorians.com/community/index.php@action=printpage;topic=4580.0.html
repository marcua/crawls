				I am considering joining ancestry.com for genealogical research - has anyone used it? do they suck? do they overcharge your credit card and not allow you to quit? <br /><br />just checking.

				There&#39;s a lot of free genealogical data out there you should check through first -- a great place to start is Cyndi&#39;s List (http://www.cyndislist.com/).&nbsp; Cyndi is a woman who has been cataloguing genealogical sites on the Internet for over 10 years now.&nbsp; She also has a section on how to approach Ancestry.com (http://www.cyndislist.com/ancestry.htm) (that link is not to Ancestry.com, but to Cyndi&#39;s page about it).<br /><br />From my experience, Ancestry.com does have some stuff that other sites don&#39;t, or that other sites also charge for, like certain census, birth/death, and ships&#39; registries information.&nbsp; But through careful searching you can either find what you need, or find the direction you need to go in before paying Ancestry.com anything.

				I recently installed ancestry.com&#39;s software packages for my aunt and it&#39;s a very powerful tool.&nbsp; She got the software and access to all the national databases for something around $100.&nbsp; It offers an incredible amount of resources including some partners websites for helping to manage your family trees and all the information is readily available from a great search interface they built on top of the databases.&nbsp; It could be overkill for a small project, but it was the best product we saw out there.&nbsp; Make sure you&#39;re familiar with everything you&#39;re getting.&nbsp; They do sell a few different packages bundled with a different depth and breadth of information, just make sure you understand all that you&#39;re getting and how to use it it could be cumbersome.&nbsp; <br />We did have a problem initially installing it because there was a conflict with an older version, but their help line was actually very helpful and friendly.&nbsp; They were even nice enough to point out that we had purchased a few items individually (the software and the database access) for more than it would cost for the bundle, so she was refunded the difference.

				Cool, thanks. <br /><br />I think I am going to see what kind of progress i can make without using it for a while and then see about signing up.
