				Being a new building it&#039;s probably tough to find someone who&#039;s lived there long enough. My coworker has been looking in the area for apartments and has taken a tour through the units here and they look pretty solid.&nbsp; Other than that not much feedback.<br /><br />Their website is: http://www.astorianw.com/<br />

				If that&#039;s the building on the corner of 21st and Ast Blvd, I would immagine the building is pretty solid due to the ammount of time it took to complete.

				I am also moving in there Saturday, the views are amazing and the building itself looks great, I mean brand new.&nbsp; All new appliances, w/d in the apt, rooftop deck, gym, I can&#039;t wait.&nbsp; I have never lived in Astoria, but I have great expectations from what I have read/heard.&nbsp; Good luck!

				We are moving there next week.&nbsp; &nbsp;The building management seems extra nice for an all ammenities building. The appliances and fixtures are more in line with what I&#039;m used to seeing in Condos and Co-ops, not rentals. That&#039;s what ultimately sold us on the place. The fact that our 2 bedroom has two balconys is also nice. It&#039;s a &quot;bit&quot; of a walk to the N/Q but nothing extreme. <br /><br />-Kate

				So I have lived there since Sept 7th, probably one of the first people to move in. Overall the apartments are nice, I pay about $2300 for a one bedroom with price for Parking garage included. However I&#039;m not impressed at all with how the apartment was not clean or ready on my move in date. I just got blinds last week, all the items that I wanted fixed are still not repaired. The painting was done badly, so I had to ask to repaint. <br /><br />keep in mind, I was one of the first people to move in, so that might have to do a lot with it. But one the things that I was highly disappointed with, was that I thought the leasing agents were nice and I was comforted by the fact that they were in the building. Come to find out, once you sign your lease, they have nothing to do with you!! They are just sales, separate than Criterion, which is who handles basically everything else. :-( and they are not as helpful, accessible or nice. <br /><br />Also it is a walk to the N/Q but there is a bus that will take you there. <br /><br />I&#039;m in the D line, the room is good size with two closets, but the living room though a good size, doesn&#039;t have enough wall room, so the furniture is odd to setup I think. <br /><br />The Parking Garage is small, and hard to park and get out of.<br /><br />The gym is fine, I used it a couple of times. <br /><br />Overall I think they are getting better and I like it.

Street noise can be loud during day but I don&#039;t really mind.&nbsp; With windows closed, I hear almost nothing.&nbsp; They are double glass and that certainly makes a difference.&nbsp; At night, I hear some movement over the bridge but just a bit and, again, almost nothing with windows closed.&nbsp; The apartment next to me is occupied and I&#039;ve yet to hear anything.&nbsp; I don&#039;t hear anything above or below either.&nbsp; I&#039;m not one to notice but I honestly haven&#039;t heard a peep.&nbsp; Lots of young professionals who work long hours, couples also working long days, and some families (with small children). The apartments aren&#039;t really big enough to accommodate more than 1 child (there are no 3 bedroom to my knowledge), so I&#039;ve yet to see more than a few. <br /><br />Building staff has been extremely accommodating. There were a couple of issues when we moved in (small things like a toilet part that needed to be replaced). They were at my place within 1 hour of reporting it.&nbsp; I kid you not!&nbsp; I&#039;ve lived in other ammenity buildings and have not had such luck! <br /><br />Also, Hi Neighbor!

They are definitely still putting stuff in place, like our gas was not connected to stove but CONED is coming tomorrow.&nbsp; Have you been in contact with Laura at Criterion. She&#039;s been super accomodating with us, we had mover issues and she basically bent all the rules for us. She also helped us with some minor stuff, the repairs.&nbsp; But I also LOVED the leasing agents.&nbsp; So, I understand what you mean.&nbsp; They are super sweet in the rental office on site.

The photos online are accurate just remove all the well designed furniture.&nbsp; The gym is your basic machines+weights area but very nice, all new. The roof deck has chairs and furniture and with a 360 view. The front desk is basic with black/white tile floor. The hallways are plain with brown apartment doors and tiling instead of carpet.

				That policy just seems kind of strange to me.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure how they can actually bar anyone from even taking pictures of themselves in the environment of the amenities - say sunning with friends on the roof deck or a friendly pose in the hallway - and posting it up on Facebook or putting it in an online album.&nbsp; How can they actually outlaw that?&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure why they wouldn&#039;t just post pictures of the amenities on their site.&nbsp; Sounds like an oversight to me.&nbsp; Regardless, you can&#039;t expect someone to have to take the time to do this for you (most people are just very busy) and your best bet would be to visit the actual building and see it for yourself.&nbsp; &nbsp;Just know that while it is luxury and you get what you pay for and they do look nice, you are paying almost twice as much for what a normal one-bedroom would cost in Astoria.&nbsp; They do look wonderful though and if that&#039;s not a concern, no biggie at all.<br /><br />

				Ive been looking at the website for this building and it looks beautiful from what I see. All of your comments are really helpful. I am wondering if anyone can tell me about thier experience with the leasing office. Is there a fee associated with renting in this building, a credit check or just a salary requirement and references? Also, does anyone know how long the commute is to midtown? <br /><br />I know Im asking alot, but Im interested to know how you feel about living in Astoria. If your into healthy eating, organic foods.. do you find that there are stores that cater to your needs? Do you feel like the neighborhood is reletively safe? Is the building well kept? <br /><br />Im not sure if this is against any kind of building policy, but if anyone would like to share what the rent range and utility agreement is for a one bedroom, that would be very helpful. <br /><br />Thanks in advance to anyone that responds...

				I&#039;d be happy to answer them!<br /><br />It&#039;s a no fee building.&nbsp; We found the apartment through a broker but the building pays the broker&#039;s fee.&nbsp; I think you can also make an appointment with the building itself but I&#039;m not sure about that, it&#039;s kinda an odd arrangement (citihabitants manages the building but Criterion owns it). The building management ran a credit check and wanted a pay stub.&nbsp; I believe you also have to supply your last landlord&#039;s (if you have one) #.&nbsp; I&#039;m not positive though because my significant other did some of the paperwork. It&#039;s a 15 minute subway ride to midtown.&nbsp; It&#039;s under 10 minute walk to the subway. I can make it in 5 minutes but I remember thinking it was &quot;longish&quot; for the&nbsp; first couple weeks.&nbsp; It&#039;s about 7-8 blocks? Anyway, I&#039;m not complaining.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t want to live farther from the subway, though.&nbsp; You get 2 months free upon signing the lease and don&#039;t pay rent until the 3rd month.&nbsp; You do put down a security deposit. One bedrooms, if you figure in the 2 months free, I think are in the 1900-2500 range and 2 bedrooms at 2500-3,000+. We pay about 2800 for a 2 bedroom. There are tons of layouts (we looked at all of them before deciding) and 1-2 bathroom options, plus price depends on what floor you live on. The roof deck is awesome. <br /><br />And just because I don&#039;t want to seem mean re: providing pictures. I think the management is pretty internet savvy and this is my real first name.&nbsp; I just didn&#039;t want to make any waves for the first months living there.&nbsp; The fixtures are beautiful and so are the floors.&nbsp; Yes, the photos online are after an interior decorator worked some magic. You just have to imagine the apartment empty.&nbsp; I know, hard to do sometimes. <br />There are plenty of healthy food options but don&#039;t expect a Whole Foods, or whole foods-like place.&nbsp; There&#039;s some great farmer&#039;s markets in the area.&nbsp; And 30th avenue (between like 30-35th street), which you&#039;ll be close to every day if you take the subway, has these awesome cheap produce stores.&nbsp; I get the best fresh food for a great price.&nbsp;

				Thanks so much for your reply. The building sounds like it is in my price range and I am very happy to hear about the food markets in the area. So I guess, it looks like a 25 minute trip to midtown with the walk to the subway, which is really perfect. <br /><br />If your willing and have the info, I would love to contact the broker you used (if you were happy with them, ofcourse). <br /><br />Thanks again!&nbsp; :-)

I guess they figure this saves them money in the long run since they pay the brokers fee $500 is definitely cheaper than a brokers fee. ALSO - Just &#039;cause AstoriaNW is paying the broker a fee doesn&#039;t mean your broker can&#039;t still try to charge you a fee and get double payment on this deal so be wary of those kinds of brokers. <br /><br />We moved in at the end of October (new to New York &amp; Queens) and we also love the building and location. Feels safe, comfortable, close to Astoria Park, about a mile from Costco, tons of places to eat, and the staff is all great. I specifically LOVE that the building uses the online BuildingLink site to connect residents, post messages and of course that there is an iphone app so you can always see if you&#039;ve received a package, submit a repair request, leave front desk instructions, etc right on your phone. One of my favorite parts about the location is that we are the 2nd to last stop on the N/Q so you stand a pretty good chance of getting a seat on the train since only Ditmars people board before us heading into Manhattan. <br /><br />KateNW hope to bump into you in the halls one day and Lovee01 good luck in your search!<br /><br />clarissa<br />

I&#039;m glad to hear it. When we were looking, several months before you, they encouraged using a broker with them paying the fee. In fact, we&#039;d walked into the building but got the name of a broker. We were told they wouldn&#039;t accept brokers charging fees at the time. They&#039;d worked that out with all brokers. However, glad they are encouraging going directly through them. We&#039;ve lived in big buildings like this previously, and always done as you said---go straight to the management office.

				Thanks for the information. I will be contacting the management office in just a couple weeks to view apartments in the building. I just hope there are some apartments left! Thanks again residents of AstoriaNW. You&#039;re all so helpful&nbsp; :-)

				Hey, I&#039;m coming in late on this discussion so apologies if this has already been answered but the NW is on Astoria Blvd. @ 21st Street?&nbsp; And the management office is in the building? And finally, do they have their own website?&nbsp; I haven&#039;t found one by googling.&nbsp; Thanks so much.

				WARNING: DO NOT MOVE INTO THIS BUILDING!! <br /><br />All the residents are facing major problems. I&#039;m the one with the posting from October, by Dec. it started to become clear to all of us the construction problems causing all of our heating bills to be around the range of $300 - $600 <br /><br />The building got sold to new owners. The entire transaction was very shady, and the new owners are an investment company that hired a mgmt company to take care of the building.<br /><br />Mgmt company isn&#039;t able to address any questions in regards to the resident&#039;s complains about the heating and electricy bills and faulty construction. <br /><br />The balcony doors swing open due to the vents blowing air through the buidling!! <br /><br />I moved out already! Many tenants have with held rent in hopes we get answers to our issues. And a few our considering moving out as well. <br /><br />It is terrible conditions, and these apartments are way over priced for what they are worth. <br /><br />Again I warn you, DO YOURSELF A FAVOR, DO NOT MOVE THERE!&nbsp; <br /><br />And no this is not just one upset resident, i wish! We have a facebook group and goolge group dedicated to discussing our issues. Everyone is suffering! <br />

				this is so true. this building seems nice with tons of amenities - but it is AWFUL to pay $300 gas bills for a 1 bedroom in winter. read the other posts about this building on the website and listen to what samar says - DO NOT LIVE HERE<br /><br />check out the facebook group &quot;Astoria NW&quot; it&#039;s private but if you join you can see the slew of issues. save yourself money. it looks nice, but unless you are willing to add $200-$650 onto your rent for gas bills, and want to be lied to and &quot;bs&quot;ed to death by management, don&#039;t live here. there are plenty of better buildings where you get more for your money<br />
