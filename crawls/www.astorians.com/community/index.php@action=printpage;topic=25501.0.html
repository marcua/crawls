				Has anyone seen this place?&nbsp; I was skeptical that a liquor store/wine shop was opening on Ditmars, but this place is CLASSY.&nbsp; The owners are very friendly and they have great selection.&nbsp; A great new edition to a revitalized corner.&nbsp;

				Just stopped by this evening with the wife. I was surprised how nice it looked and the selection looks good. I spoke with the owner and he plans to have tastings on a regular basis. It was also much bigger inside than I expected.

				This place is beautiful!&nbsp; We stopped in last night on a whim and spent a good 10-15 minutes browsing and picking out a bottle of wine.&nbsp; It&#039;s a welcomed addition to the neighbourhood!

				I&#039;m so happy to have a high-end liquor store on this side of Astoria. The selections are great (they had some bourbons I&#039;ve never had before) and wines as cheap as $10 a bottle.

				Very excited to stop in here and check it out!&nbsp; Agree that an upscale liquor store with a nice whiskey, rye and bourbon selection is a hot ticket right now.&nbsp;

				This is great news! I&#039;ll check them out for sure. I know close to nothing about bourbons and whisky, but I&nbsp; absolutely love Woodford Reserve (not the double oak). Thank you Omega Wines and Spirits for introducing me to this brand.

				Stopped in to buy French wine to take to Francis Cafe since they&#039;re BYOB right now.&nbsp; Beautiful shop!&nbsp; Maybe the nicest wine and liquor store in Astoria.&nbsp; Very helpful staff.&nbsp;
