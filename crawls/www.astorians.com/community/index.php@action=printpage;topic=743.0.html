				Post by: <strong>RavenswoodCSA</strong> on <strong>September 14, 2005, 04:14:32 PM</strong>
			</dt>
			<dd class="postbody">
				Guys, <br /><br />I figured I'd post some of the info for the CSA here, since I don't know that I have an accurate mailing list going right now. &nbsp;So here are snippets from my last email...<br /><br />An email from Emily Maxwell is included at the end of<br />this email. &nbsp;She is holding a Partnership for Parks<br />meeting tonight to talk about a shoreline clean-up in<br />Astoria and LIC. &nbsp;Partnerships does a great job and<br />everyone I've meet at their meetings is fantastic. <br />I'm unable to attend the meeting tonight, but am<br />planning to do the clean-up on the 17th. &nbsp;If you live<br />in LIC/Astoria, you should come out for that and, if<br />you're not already booked, go to the meeting tonight. <br /><br /><br />On to CSA business, we're having a meeting on the 30th<br />of September, so mark your calenders. &nbsp;It's a Friday<br />night at 6:30 at Tara's house. &nbsp;Tara lives on 23rd<br />Street and 31st. Ave, so it should be a short jaunt<br />for lots of you. &nbsp; We need to talk about where to move<br />the CSA distribution for next season. &nbsp;I will be<br />coming with ideas and hope that you will have some,<br />too. &nbsp;Think about your local spots... community<br />centers, churches, not-for-profits, schools. &nbsp;We can<br />approach anyone about hosting our distributions, so<br />don't be afraid to throw out ALL ideas. &nbsp;Let Tara<br />(dramaqueen20@yahoo.com) and I know if you are coming<br />and contact Tara for specific questions about how to<br />find her apartment. &nbsp;She has been very kind to offer<br />her apartment for this meeting.<br /><br />On the topic of events, I'd like to have a potluck<br />dinner... we can do it in the Ravenswood Community<br />Center where our first meeting was, although it's kind<br />of drab, and we'd have to do it during the week. &nbsp;We<br />can have it in my backyard, although it's in Brooklyn.<br />&nbsp;If we're doing it at my house, I'm thinking of the<br />24th of September, a Saturday night. &nbsp;<br /><br />As mentioned in an older newsletter, The New York<br />premier of Deborah Koons Garcia’s film, The Future of<br />Food will be held at the Film Forum on September 14th.<br />&nbsp;“Shot on location in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, THE<br />FUTURE OF FOOD examines the complex web of market and<br />political forces that are changing what we eat as huge<br />multinational corporations seek to control the world's<br />food system. The film also explores alternatives to<br />large-scale industrial agriculture, placing organic<br />and sustainable agriculture as real solutions to the<br />farm crisis today.” &nbsp;One of our members has seen this<br />and said it was great. &nbsp;I'm planning to go, so if you<br />want to have a date with Cara, drop me a line. &nbsp;<br /><br />And Just Food is Calling All Food Enthusiasts! &nbsp;Do you<br />LOVE to cook? &nbsp;Do you or someone you know want to<br />support CSA? &nbsp;Just Food has an opportunity for you as<br />a volunteer Community Food Educator! &nbsp;If you or<br />someone you know would like to facilitate Food<br />Education Workshops at a CSA please contact Elizabeth<br />by email at elizabeth@justfood.org or by phone at<br />212-645-9880 ext 230 to receive an application. <br />Training will last three days. &nbsp;The dates are, Tuesday<br />September 20th, Wednesday September 21th and Friday<br />September 23rd from 6:30 to 8:30 PM at 210 East 51st<br />Street at 3rd avenue. &nbsp;After training, Just Food<br />requires a minimum of 6 workshops from September to<br />November. &nbsp;---- Liz, our cooking demonstrator, came to<br />us via this program. &nbsp;It's a great time.<br /><br />Question? &nbsp;Email, call or post me.

				Hi RavenswoodCSA, nice to see you on the board :-),<br />Is it possible for you to slate me for my volunteer hours late into the season?<br />People who don't like cold weather should put in their hours now; I happen to thrive in zero degree temperatures.<br /><br />BTW, did you find out about uploading flyers onto the CSA website? ( http://www.ravenswoodcsa.org ) I wouldn't mind handing them out and distributing them where I think they'll do the most good. I am uncomfortable with the fact that we are so close to our quota of 35 people in order to keep the program here alive, yet I am optimistic and have talked to many people who would like to join if only it weren't so close to the end of the season.<br /><br />How did the interview go with the journalist yesterday?<br /><br />yours,<br />-zeno.

				I love your encouragement, Zeno! :wink: (look, I even winked!)<br /><br />Now is a great time to start recruiting for next year! &nbsp;I can send a PDF of the brochure to anyone who wants it, but I don't know that I can post one on the webpage. &nbsp;Just email me at ravenswoodcsa@yahoo.com. &nbsp;That said, I guess I should start signing up existing members for next year.<br /><br />Andrea and I went to see the Future of Food last night. &nbsp;I know MegC has seen this, too. &nbsp;It was a bit frightening, despite our knowledge of the evil practices of AgriBusiness. &nbsp;I left feeling quite relived to have a CSA at my fingertips.

				Is there an update on tomorrow's farm tour? My husband and I were planning on going, but we need to know where to meet if we're going with a group from NYC to there.<br /><br />Otherwise please provide public transit directions to the farm and we'll see if we can get there on our own.<br /><br />Thanks!

				Sorry, I was offline for a few days - hope you found your way. &nbsp;Did the tour still go on despite the rain?<br /><br />As for tomorrow, I'm doing my 3 hours volunteering from 4-7. &nbsp;I'm still happy to drive people there, but I would suggest you find your way back - I'm assuming the best is the bus. &nbsp;Sorry for any inconvenience there.

				Yes - we were able to go to the farm. Matt and I went with Cara and a few other people from the CSA. It was a little bit of a drive, but it was great to see the farm in person and see where our veggies come from. Thankfully for most of our visit there it didn't rain, so that was really great.<br /><br />Anyway, it is a great farm and the people are really nice. We feel really positive about supporting them and being able to get good quality vegetables from a good source. If they do another CSA trip you should go if you haven't already.

				When we were at the farm Farmer Bill told us that we would probably be getting sweet potatoes for the rest of the season. I definitely need to come up with new ways of making them. I always just bake them in the oven like regular potatoes, but I need to get creative if I am going to be getting them every week!

				I am also searching for new Sweet Potato recipes. &nbsp;I'm happy about them because they're super healthy and won't rot if i don't eat them this week. &nbsp;<br /><br />I just baked them in wedges with kosher salt and diped them in a creamy horseradish sauce. &nbsp;<br /><br />I was just reading about them on WeightWatchers and they have a breakfast pancake recipe made with pureed sweet potaoes, baked chunks that are tossed with teriaki before baking, and sweet pototes in a more traditional potato salad. &nbsp; &nbsp;You can shred them and make them in latke thing. &nbsp;My boyfriend mashes them with butter, rasins and orange juice. &nbsp;That's tasty!<br /><br />also, do not refridgerate them... a cool, dark place is best. &nbsp;about 55 degrees. &nbsp;It's tough to store things like that for those of us who live in the city. &nbsp;If they're stored at room temp, they should last about a week. &nbsp;I just learned this... mine are in the crisper and maybe I'll have to find a place to store them.

				Yes, city apartments abound in cool dark places that are about 55 degrees. &nbsp;:wink: <br /><br />We're lucky, we actually have one of those wall boxes in our kitchen that has no insulation between it and the outside. &nbsp;Horrible in summer, but in winter it keeps root vegetables quite nicely. <br /><br />I came up with a really good mock souffle type thing for the acorn squash that I think would work well with sweet potato, but it has cheese and egg in it (not to mention sausage). &nbsp;It's on my blog (http://crunchyflake.blogspot.com/2005/09/night-is-time-when-garden-centers-are.html), if anyone's interested. &nbsp;<br /><br />BUT, you could use the idea to build a similar mash or puree that's vegan. Start with olive oil or coconut milk, and add whatever spices suit. &nbsp;I'm thinking aromatic - a little allspice, hint of cloves, or maybe Chinese 5-spice powder.

				Having the sweet potatoes is awesome! &nbsp;I love roasting them with yukon golds, parsnips, and carrots, seasoned with garlic cloves, lots of kosher salt, thyme, oregano, and rosemary. &nbsp;And olive oil, of course. &nbsp;I cook them uncovered at 375 degrees for about an hour. &nbsp;This is my weekly root vegetable roasting pattern in the cooler months.

				Dearest CSA Members.<br /><br />We'll be having our first CSA potluck to celebrate the end of our season on Friday November 18th at the Freeze Peach. &nbsp;Please bring a dish and some good cheer. &nbsp;We'll be there between 7-9 (or even later). &nbsp;Please email to let us know if you're planning to come, just so that we'll have a good idea of ##'s (as you all know, the Freeze Peach isn't a huge place).<br /><br />See you before then!<br />cara<br /><br />p.s. &nbsp;Last week I described a soup that I had made which showcased chicken broth and bacon as &quot;mostly vegetarian&quot;. &nbsp;This was downright shameful. &nbsp;I am going to try to bring a wholly vegetarian dish, but many people have asked if we *had* to bring a vegetarian dish and I said no. &nbsp;If you'd like to let us know what you plan to bring, we can try to have some sort of type/course balance.
