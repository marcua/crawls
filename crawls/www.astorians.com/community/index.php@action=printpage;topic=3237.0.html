				people who don&#39;t smile. <br /><br />What kind of sad f**king life must a person have who can&#39;t smile back when someone gives them genuine smile. Glad I have a happy life, and even when I&#39;m NOT happy I can still smile. Sorry, just had to say something to someone. <br /><br />And I don&#39;t trust the government, but maybe that goes without saying.&nbsp; :-)

				I am from rural Tennessee, and where I come from we wave and smile by tradition. Now I realize it&#39;s different in NY to some extent (there&#39;s way too many people to wave at!). However, we stayed on Astoria Blvd and walked past the police precinct two or three times a day. Nearly every time there was a policeman outside the office, and I&#39;d smile at them. Only one guy over the course of a week actually smiled back.<br /><br />Kinda disappointing. Maybe my expectations are misplaced?

				Oh, come on.&nbsp; She said &quot;genuine smile&quot;, not &quot;smile all the time&quot;.&nbsp; <br /><br />That said, I think it&#39;s regional/cultural.&nbsp; It startles me how much people smile when I&#39;m in places like the midwest.&nbsp; I took a series of week-long business trips to Minneapolis in the late &#39;90s, and by the end of the week the smiles and what I felt was over-friendliness of strangers would start to get on my nerves.&nbsp;

				To a point I understand not smiling at someone on the street in NYC never know what weirdo is going to take it as a come-on or something - Texas is &nbsp;like Tenn, and of course I realize Southerners in general are much friendlier. But in an office with people you work with? And see like 400 times a day, you can&#39;t smile once? It&#39;s sad like I said and I really feel sorry for people who have to &quot;save&quot; their smiles. I guess I&#39;m just one of those &quot;glass is half-full people&quot;. <br /><br />&nbsp;:-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-)

				Well, you know. One can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s fake. If someone smiles at you, what a nice thing it is to receive. Fake or genuine, I would err on the side of perceiving it as genuine just for the sake of the soul.<br /><br />I much prefer to see happier looking people to ones who don&#39;t smile. I am, of course, one of those people who don&#39;t smile so much, but it&#39;s just me. But, I will smile if I want to share my happiness.<br /><br />But, I like to see people smile. If it&#39;s fake, you can usually tell.

You know I&#39;m not talking about an ear to ear grin stuck on 24/7. I just don&#39;t understand how it&#39;s <em>possible</em> to look at someone who is smiling and not smile. At least a little bit. And I second what Victorine said about people who take themselves too seriously or feel like they are above someone by not returning a smile. Power trip. Doesn&#39;t work on me though I am not intimidated, like I said, I just feel sympathy. I guess those who are &quot;saving&quot; their smiles can have the mortician afix a smile that will not go away.<br /><br />Anyway, I should have put this under rants. Yikes, I really didn&#39;t mean for it to turn into this.

I&#39;ve seen a lot of this world and met all kinds of people so I think I have a right to say what the hell I want to, as do you, though you certainly seem like the one in the tiny, joyless bubble. The difference between you and I is that I have made FRIENDS with people of all walks of life, and that is pretty hard to do when you go around with a stick-up-your-a**-look on your face for the world to see.&nbsp; You seem like the kind of person who keeps to his own miserable kind. Please continue to do so.<br /><br />And like I&#39;ve said before, as much as I appreciate the nice comments about me FROM MY FRIENDS - I was in the military and have dealt with all kinds of a**holes so jcy I don&#39;t need anyone to stick up for me. I still get my feelings hurt, but not by people who have no meaning to me. The point is <span class="bbc_u">I</span> have feelings and emotions and I express them OFTEN and without regard of what someone might think of me. <br /><br />Of course I&#39;m not happy ALL the time, but that doesn&#39;t mean I go around looking like my world is falling apart or that I&#39;m pi**ed off all the time. I can be as big a biotch as the next person. I can also say thank you with a smile on my face as well as I can say f*ck you with a smile on my face - depends on the situation. But I am NEVER insincere. <br /><br />Smiling is a universal language. Mirki2 what culture are you talking about? Some war-torn land where all the people do is fight and seem to enjoy being miserable? <br /><br />&quot;They might not need me; but they might. I&#39;ll let my head be just in sight; a smile as small as mine might be precisely their necessity.&quot; <br />Emily Dickinson<br /><br />ANYWAY, I&#39;ve said my .02 and yes, I&#39;m still&nbsp; :-)

				(This may be my longest yet....)<br /><br />Miri,<br /><br />I&#39;m glad you realize I was not trying to be insulting or insensitive at all - not even to jcy, well, not till he got a little nasty with me. So often things become misconstrued here, esp. when you haven&#39;t met someone face to face. Before I met you or Jtrane or Lanseaux or Daisy or anyone here, each of your posts were just black letters in a white space. Empty kind of - interesting (of course!) or I wouldn&#39;t have stuck around - but they didn&#39;t mean that much. Now, when I read y&#39;all&#39;s posts I hear and see you. I know how ya move when ya talk, your inflections, accents, sense of humor and yes, even your smiles, and that makes all the difference in the world in understanding one another - the wonderful human connection. I love that. Goldfish Boy said he doesn&#39;t smile a lot. His isn&#39;t often a big toothy grin, but he does smile - it&#39;s subtle and cute and sweet! Maybe if jcy and I had met before in RL, the thread might not have ended in the infamous Black Hole. We&#39;ll never know. <br /><br />Of course I know different cultures have different customs and I totally respect that, I&#39;m always curious and interested in the ways of each kind of people. I find it fascinating, and this is one reason I love NYC - there are so many different kinds of people. How boring it would be if we were all the same. <br /><br />When I ask questions about things it&#39;s because I really want to know, not because I&#39;m giving my disapproval or trying to be condescending, god knows half the time I feel like I just fell off the turnip truck! I&#39;ve always wanted to know <em>why</em>, and I&#39;ve driven people crazy with it. My dad used to get so frustrated with me (&quot;But <em>why</em> is Pi this (insert) number?&quot; I still suck at math), and on and on till now and <em>why</em> doesn&#39;t he/she smile?. This is why I became a reporter, so I could ask a million questions. I&#39;m sure last night one Astorian just wanted to enjoy her tamale instead of answering my questions about the different customs of a particular religion, but it&#39;s because I want to know <em>why</em> and I felt comfortable asking her. <br /><br />Sometimes some of us, and I&#39;m first in line, need to be told to hush (with a&nbsp; :-) of course.) If anyone gets through this whole post I&#39;m sure you WILL be saying that to me.<br /><br />When I pass the mosque near my house do I look at the men&#39;s faces or smile at them? No, I&#39;m not a total hayseed. But when I go to the Ditmars Dunkin Donuts, where I&#39;ve gone almost daily for more than a year, and all of the employees are of middle eastern/Indian/Pakistani/I&#39;mtoodumbtoknow descent, do I smile and greet them wholeheartedly - yes, and they do the same to me. They ask about my husband, I ask about their families and it is a very pleasant exchange. They enjoy it as much as I do. When my husband goes in they always tell him to say hello to me. <br /><br />When I shop at a store, whether it&#39;s on 5th Avenue or the LES, do I expect respectful service with at least a hint of a smile. (Okay, it is NY, at least not a furrowed angry stare then). YES, or like someone already said, I will gladly take my business elsewhere. And I won&#39;t have a problem telling the manager, with a&nbsp; :-), why I&#39;m not shopping there anymore. It&#39;s pretty obvious managers know this, almost every want ad I read, no matter the business, wants applicants who are&nbsp; &quot;friendly/personable/upbeat&quot;.<br /><br />I know all of my immediate neighbors. (Part of this is from my policeman dad - &quot;Cathy Jo, go meet those folks so if you have to pound on their door at 3 a.m., without a stitch between you and the world, they&#39;ll know ya and open the door!&quot; Which has turned out to be good advice....but that&#39;s another story.) But also because I don&#39;t want to be the &quot;average&quot; New Yorker, being so removed from their neighborhood, just existing and not living WHERE they live. Ya know? <br /><br />I eased into it. I started by smiling at them a few times, then exchanging &quot;Good Morning&#39;s&quot; and finally introducing myself when I saw them outside. Did they all think I was el loco? Of course! Italians next door, Greeks across the street, Spanish and Indian next door. We all have accents! None of them knew what to think of me, but now, a year later, we wave and have actual conversations. Talib, the little boy next door always asks questions about Texas and, like any good Texan, I&#39;m always willing to <del>brag</del> share. Do I talk to his dad and uncle? Not usually more than a respectful nod and hello, but I&#39;ve gotten pretty friendly with his mom and aunt. It&#39;s not always easy - their English is a lot better than my Urdu!<br /><br />Do I walk down the mean streets of NYC with a huge grin directed at every passerby? Of course not. But I often do have a big smile because my husband is making me laugh, or we see an awesome old building, or if we get lucky and have one of those magical only-in-New-York moments or simply because I&#39;m happy. I am in love with life, my husband and New York City and I express that, I don&#39;t understand how one can&#39;t. And, if one is enjoying life, how and <em>why</em> keep those wonderful feelings bottled up inside? Then what is life? Does being constantly solemn and void of expression make one more pious? Some may see this as the musings of a simpleton, but it kind of is simple....if you&#39;re happy and you know it - show it! Not for others but for yourself - to <em>feel</em>. <br /><br />Now, to the root of this thread, who by the way looks like an average white guy, no outwardly religious signs, overhead him talking, he&#39;s from Upstate......<br /><br />When I&#39;ve worked in a small office for two days as the main, up-at-the-front receptionist and you&#39;ve had to ask for my help a thousand times and I&#39;ve smiled a thousand average, pleasant, how-can-I-help-you-smiles AND done everything you wanted, perfectly I might add, AND you aren&#39;t even the head guy, do I expect you to show some kind of response that resembles an upright-walking, breathing being who recognizes me as the same? F**K YES. It doesn&#39;t matter what religion/heritage/sexual orientation/disablility/gender/other EOE designation you fall under. I don&#39;t care if you just came in from Pluto to protest being knocked off the planets list. If you are capable of working in an office then you should be capable of this as well.<br /><br />And if you aren&#39;t, it makes me think you are nothing but a soul-less vessel who has no empathy or regard for others and I have no trust in you. IMHO, if I never mentioned that.... :-D <br /><br />And you probably lied on your Solar System Visa anyway and came from Uranus. <br /><br />Love, <br />Cathy

				[Loudspeaker] And here ladies and gentlemen, as a very special part of our tour, we have the troll cage. These trolls were just caught off the coast of Iceland this week and we&#39;re very fortunate to have them here for you all to see.<br /><br />Isn&#39;t it funny how all the trolls call each other silly names while at the same time claiming immunity for superior intellect for themselves? As long as someone else &quot;started it&quot; they lose all rational sense, even those with higher degrees are rendered childish. The trolls can&#39;t resist each others taunts. This is their natural offense mechanism, to try and cause as much a stink as possible. <br /><br />Strange and beautiful creatures they are. Coming up next, and on the right side of the van ... the &quot;development&quot; community...

				I&#39;m a little hesitant to post here, but I just wanted to note that the workplace brings out the bitter/nasty in people like little else. That doesn&#39;t excuse anyone&#39;s behavior, but I&#39;ve learned not to take anything personally at work - too many people hate their 9-5 life, or are over-worked and over-stressed.&nbsp; I mean, I can be more cranky and snippy at work than I ever (usually) am in the rest of my life. <br /><br />I won&#39;t touch on anything else brought up here.&nbsp; &nbsp; :-)

				when i was mentally composing my reply, i came to realize that i was going to spend more time defending myself against the spurious accusation of being a troll instead of further elucidating why i thought nycatexas was espousing a dirt simple view of humanity or human interaction.&nbsp; and i thought i was done when she made the wrong headed reference to osama and that had sufficiently exposed what i thought was the fundamental weakness in the whole premise of this thread.<br /><br />but instead, more people spent their time fixated on my toxic reaction to her reader&#39;s digest mindset instead of actually reading my replies.<br /><br />so i realize now that no matter what i say, people have made up their mind to label me as a troll.&nbsp; though i am fairly certain there is one respectable person who replied that might not think that, i won&#39;t embarass him by associating him with me.<br /><br />so please go ahead and speculate further on how many friends i have, what type of friends i have, or where i&#39;ve lived or traveled and gauge how happy i must be and what the causes of that unhappiness might be.&nbsp; i&#39;m sure those thoughts will allow you to view me safely in whatever box you put people in when they express thoughts that cause discomfort.
