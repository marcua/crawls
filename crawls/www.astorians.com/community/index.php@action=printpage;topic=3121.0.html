				I&#39;m a big sports nut, and would LOVE for Astorians.com to have a category (or even a subcategory) just devoted to sports.&nbsp; Right now the Mets and Yanks are in first place, fantasy football is starting up, and we just went through one of the most entertaining world cups ever.&nbsp; I&#39;m sure other sports-minded guys and gals would love to have a section devoted purely to this topic where they can celebrate (or cry) about their fave teams (local or otherwise)<br /><br />It can also be used to set up games among the community (softball, ultimate frisbee, touch football, heck even poker, bowling, or darts) <br /><br />Thanks!<br />-Rob<br /><br />

				Me, soon to possibly jump on the Cubs bandwagon (what!?!, so what if I&#39;ll be living on the Southside and should support the White Sox), would love to see the Mets in the World Series this year. So I think a sports thread would be good, for both our randomness about our respective sports team fandom and things like frisbee, gym-ing, etc
