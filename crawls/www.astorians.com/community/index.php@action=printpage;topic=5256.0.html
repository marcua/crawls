				Hi Everyone,<br />My roommate and I are thinking of renting an apt in this bldg through a realtor. It is a gut renovation so we were pretty excited until I googled the address and found it on a bedbug infestation website! The posting was from 2006 and the anonymous poster said they had bedbugs for 2 months (and so did a neighbor) and was taking the management company to court over it but never posted a follow up. I read that entire buildings can become infested. We are new to Astoria and love the location of this apt but don&#039;t know what to do... Any info would be greatly appreciated!

				Could you please post the site where you read about the bedbug infestation.<br /><br />(http://www.pshark.com/mason/components/photo/pic_view.html?size=1&amp;imgname=4-692-76.jpg&amp;type=nycbw)<br />If this is the building:<br /><br />There are no current violations of any kind. There has *never* been reported any violation regarding bedbugs. Your use of the term &quot;gut renovation&quot; is confusing. On 06/26/2006 they filed for a permit to &quot;rebuild [a] damaged retaining wall approximately 80&#039; length x 4&#039; high at northwest of building and also to pour concrete approximately 80&#039; length x 4&#039; wide x 6&quot; thick at rear of building on grade. no change in use, egress or occupancy.&quot;<br /><br />

				Thanks for the quick response- it is encouraging. The website is http://bedbugblog.blogspot.com just click on known infestations and scroll down. As far as the term gut renovation goes, it was used by the realty in reference to that particular apt which is under construction right now (floors, electric, etc.) but not the whole building.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I am not sure what to tell you about the reports of bedbugs. Since they have not been reported to *any* city agency, yet are listed on the blog, I *might* proceed with caution. The blog does not identify either the person reporting the problem or the apartment number. Since this building is owned by one of the classic numbered companies (3180 Reality Co LLC) can you find out who the person who really owns the building is? I could try to find out what their other buildings are and how they are being managed. Have you already signed a lease? Is it a preferential lease? Have you met the landlord? Who is the realtor?

				bedbugresistry is a good site, but i wouldn&#039;t take it as comeplete fact. there is no way every bedbug case is on that site. there would be hundreds more in queens.
