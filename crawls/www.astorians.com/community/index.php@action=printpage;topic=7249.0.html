				<strong>ZogSports</strong>, the charity-focused, social, co-ed sports league is coming to Queens for the first time this fall and we&#039;ll be playing co-ed <strong>Touch Football in Queensbridge Park</strong>!<br /><br />Join fellow young professionals in their 20s and 30s for 8-on-8 Touch Football, followed by <strong>organized Happy Hours at local bars after each game!</strong>&nbsp; This is a great way to meet your neighbors and make new friends or spend time with old ones!<br /><br />No need to put together an entire team (though many people do!) - you can sign up as an individual or a small group and we&#039;ll place you on a team with awesome other people!<br /><br />Registration is Now Open for the fall league!&nbsp; Early registration runs until July 27, so sign up now to get the lower registration fee!&nbsp; For more information and to register, visit us at www.zogsports.org, or go directly to the Football league page here: http://www.zogsports.org/Football/Queens%20Football.htm.<br /><br /><strong>Play For Your Cause:</strong><br />ZogSports encourages each team to select a charity to play for.&nbsp; We ask each captain to designate an officially sanctioned 501(c)3 not-for-profit organization before the end of the season.&nbsp; Instead of prize money, we make charitable contributions to the winning teams&#039; charities of choice.&nbsp; In addition, ZogSports&#039; happy hour partners donate 10-15% of what you eat &amp; drink to Play For Your Cause.<br />

				I&#039;m bumping this thread....come on people, it&#039;s football (or Soccer to any europeans)....The only game that comes even remotely close to being as much fun is Hungry Hungry Hippos........I have some buddies who may play who aren&#039;t astorians, but still need more interest.
