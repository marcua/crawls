				I&#39;d never had them watered down before, but the food is nothing to write home about.&nbsp; It&#39;s sad that Las Margaritas and that place down on Northern Boulevard at Steinway seem to be the only place to get Mexican and a Margarita.&nbsp; I go to Viva El Mariachi for their food, but they only have a beer and wine license.&nbsp; Anyone know of other places that you can get good Mexican with a Margarita in Astoria?&nbsp; I used to go to Tierras Mexicanas down on 36th Avenue, but they went out of business.

				Napoli is sooooo good. I never order from them as much as I should. Politos on Broadway also has excellent pizza.<br /><br />Me and my friends were fans of Las Margaritas two incarnations ago. It seems that its constantly renovated and under new ownership. We used to get trashed on margaritas in their backyard (before it was converted into a new storefront strip). <br /><br />Their burrito appetizer was huge and meal enough for us poor college students, hehe. <br />Ah to be a poor college student again...now I&#39;m just poor&nbsp; :mrgreen:
