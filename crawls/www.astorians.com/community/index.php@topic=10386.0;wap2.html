			Hello all,<br /><br />I know there have been other threads regarding salons but I&#039;ve already tried a few in Astoria and haven&#039;t been satisfied yet.&nbsp; I would like to find a stylist who knows what will work best for my hair.&nbsp; I would love to hear some suggestions and I will happily go into the city for a haircut if you know of a good stylist.&nbsp; I would like to keep the price under $100.<br /><br />Thanks, everyone!

			I went to Saloon Hair Salon in Astoria a couple weeks ago and they did a great job with my hair. I think haircuts are from $60 and up.<br /><br />

			I second Saloon. They&#039;re on 30th ave btw 36 and 37th st.&nbsp; I get my hair cut there by Frank... he&#039;s friendly and he gives a hell of a cut.

			I also go to Saloon Salon. Antoinette is great!&nbsp; Since I have short hair, my cut comes to little over $40.

			I LOVE Studio 31 on 31st Ave. btw 32nd and 33rd streets.&nbsp; My stylist, Athena, is the former owner (and landlord of the building), but still does business there on Thursday, Friday and Saturday (and maybe Sunday too, I forget).&nbsp; She&#039;s the first stylist that I&#039;ve stuck with.&nbsp; And she&#039;s very reasonable as well (around $30 for my medium length hair).&nbsp;
