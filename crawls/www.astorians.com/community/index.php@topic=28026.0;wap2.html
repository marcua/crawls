			If anyone is interested, i&#039;ve started skating and shooting around with a few guys on weeknights at Dutch Kills Playground. We have no nets, but are just shooting around into cones for now and getting back in hockey form. If anyone&#039;s interested, feel free to come by for some pick up, we&#039;ll be there Saturday morning. Email me for details...the rink is pretty decent, you can wrap the puck around, which is nice, asphalt could certainly use a repaving - playable though.
