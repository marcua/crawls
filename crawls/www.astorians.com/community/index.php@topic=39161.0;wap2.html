			I&#039;ve worn eyeglasses for most of my life.&nbsp; In the beginning they were characterized as unattractive, but as the lens became lighter and the suppliers started experimenting with different designs, eyeglasses eventually became fashionable.&nbsp; In fact, in some measure, eyewear is one of the most important fashion statements you can make because they&#039;re front and center on your face.&nbsp; Anyhow, I found a cool, convenient place to have my eyewear fixed and to buy new eyeglasses in Astoria, just off the N and Q trains.&nbsp; Check it out.

			I can definitely vouch for this place as I&#039;ve gone there for years and have always been taken care of.&nbsp; :)
