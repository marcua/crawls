				While I&#039;m all for a shelter system to support those who need help, I think this move is pretty tone deaf on the part of DHS officials: http://www.nydailynews.com/real_estate/2009/06/04/2009-06-04_city_turns_upscale_building_into_homeless_shelter.html<br /><br />What about middle class people who would be glad to rent those units at similar rates?

				What happened?&nbsp; I thought the city (and state) was having a budget crisis.&nbsp; The same one that has resulted in cuts in so many vital services, higher mass transit fares, higher taxes (unless you&#039;re rich), and thousands of layoffs from city government jobs.&nbsp; It&#039;s amazing how Mayor Gloomberg and the mini-Gloombergs he&#039;s dispatched in the various city agencies are able to find the money to pay for such things as upscale condos for the homeless, as well as the waterfall &quot;art&quot; project last year, but can&#039;t find the money to fund mass transit, keep those city workers, give raises to teachers, police, fire, etc., repair the city&#039;s decaying (and sometimes dangerous) roads, maintain vital services, etc.<br /><br />But as always, people will get impressed with the slick advertising and the billions and will re-elect Gloomberg in November...

				Does anyone know how much per night the city pays for housing + services at other locations? The $90/night includes &quot;social services, housing help and job counseling designed to get families back on their feet.&quot; I don&#039;t really care how much the units would rent for on the open market, I just care if the city is getting a decent deal from the non-profit that rented the building and is offering the support services. This article doesn&#039;t really answer those questions, so I&#039;m going to reserve judgment until I have some context.<br />

				I just wanted to point out that these units are in Crown Heights. That neighborhood was an iffy bet for those developers to build such fancy co-ops. Not many people who would have that kind of money to spend would want to live there. The article said that they were vacant because no one was buying them. I wonder if it&#039;s worse for that community to have a big vacant building attracting who knows who to squat there, fall into disrepair, be abandoned, or set on fire (as many developers do when their bets don&#039;t turn out and they want the insurance- see the Bronx fires in the 80s) or have some of that community&#039;s homeless helped out and off their streets in a supervised and structured place? Just playing devil&#039;s advocate. I do think $2700 a month is a bit much and am more pissed that the developer who made a bad decision by building something in a fringe neighborhood when he wasn&#039;t sure there was demand there in the first place is making out so well in this.

				I can see how this can cause outrage, it aggravates me, but the city has an obligation to house homeless families, especially those in need of immediate shelter. It&#039;s not as easy to find places for them. I mean how many hotels in the city offer rooms for $90 per night? Many landlords will not rent to the homeless unless the city sweetens the pot.<br /><br />Shelters are supposed to be used for temporary accommodation until more permananet housing can be found so more than more family will benefit from these apartments -- at least that how it&#039;s supposed to work.<br /><br />Believe it or not this is an improvement to what went on in the 80s and 90s when the city spents millions to warehouse families in derelict, rat infested single room hotels.<br /><br /><br />

The lack of intervention is what got us to this point in the first place. I&#039;m sure we&#039;re just going to have to agree to disagree there.

What I would draw is a heftier need for accountability and regulation. I think homeless people certainly need housing, and when times are really tough, it is important that the safety net be there for them-which really can only be provided by government programs. If anything, this points out to me the need for these types of programs to constantly be under the public eye to ensure that we all know our tax dollars are not going to finance government aid that allows for homeless people to live better than us working taxpayers do.

				I&#039;m pretty sure these places were up on Craigslist for rent for a long time before this has happened. amandax is right. Anyone outraged by the thought of homeless people living in a swank condo should go walk around Crown Heights on a beautiful Saturday afternoon and wonder if they&#039;d want to switch places with these homeless people and live in that neighborhood. If I were given the choice of having homeless people sleep on the sidewalk or live in a luxury apartment complex nobody else wants to live in, I&#039;ll take the latter. Since the place exists, it might as well be used. The $2700 figure is ludicrous though. The developer got a pretty sweet deal since I can&#039;t imagine anyone paying $2700/month to live there. I bet they could&#039;ve haggled him lower, unless there&#039;s some homeless rental law I&#039;m not aware of that requires the city to pay landlords $90/night per apartment. He probably has friends at Bushwick Economic Development Group.

I agree with you. The city should not be spending more money than necessary to help homeless people get off the streets and back to being productive members of society. I also am glad to see that you support the project of spending taxpayer dollars to assist the poorest and worst off. <br /><br />What I&#039;m puzzled about is how you know that the city is spending more money per family on this shelter than they are on other shelters. We know two things: the amount of money/night the city spends on housing and otherwise supporting families in <em>this</em> shelter (but not the amount they spend on similar services in <em>other</em> shelters), and that the complex has nice fixtures because it was originally intended to be quasi-luxury condos. This information doesn&#039;t allow us to conclude that the city is wasting money. It raises the question that the city may be wasting money, but it doesn&#039;t answer the question.<br />

				A better solution would have been for the city to turn it into temporary subsidized housing for displaced working families -- the family would pay for part of the rent, the city would subsidize, and the family would have X number of months to find permanent housing. A family with an income generated from working (as opposed to public assistance) should, in my opinion, have priority over this type of housing -- they&#039;re taxpayers. The city can offer them short term leases -- 3 months, 6 months -- so they can establish a record as a rent paying tenant and are responsible for the condition of the property when they vacate. <br /><br />I&#039;d rather see my tax dollars go to help <em>working </em> families who fall on tough times -- it can happen to anyone.<br /><br />

Today, these&nbsp; folks&nbsp; have been declared&nbsp; &#039;homeless&#039;&nbsp; and allowed&nbsp; to destroy neighborhoods and woe be unto to anyone&nbsp; who dares&nbsp; tell them to go away. They have a &#039;right&#039; to hang out in front of a&nbsp; business&nbsp; all day, drink, even though drinking is &#039;illegal&#039; on the street for me and you. <br /><br />In my once relatively quiet, at least for New York City,Astoria neighborhood, the &#039;do-gooders&#039; from the city in our society, have rented&nbsp; across the street from my home&nbsp; to folks&nbsp; who &#039;hang around&#039; the neighborhood all day drinking up there or a couple of blocks away at the supermarket. Calls to police and letters from tax payers and homeowners&nbsp; seem to temporarily&nbsp; shoo away the problem, but, they return when the heat is&nbsp; off. <br /><br />No doubt the majority&nbsp; are not from this neighborhood or even here legally, but, that doesn&#039;t matter on the Federal level, certainly now more than ever, that would be &#039;racist.&#039;&nbsp; :wink:&nbsp; &nbsp;So, what&nbsp; was once&nbsp; illegal is now legal and the tax payers, homeowners and business&nbsp; have to once again lock up and watch out. A sentiment&nbsp; from a local&nbsp; storeowner&nbsp; caught my attention yesterday as we talked this over, he said the only way&nbsp; to get rid of them is shoot them.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure he was &#039;joking&#039;, but, it is getting frustrating and dangerous.&nbsp; This is a peaceful&nbsp; man who I have seen for years, but, even he is fed up. Naturally, shooting them is&nbsp; not an option, it&#039;s&nbsp; &#039;illegal&#039;, maybe, if it gets real bad&nbsp; again, we&#039;ll get another Guliani. But, as it stands, once again, the mice are at play, you gotta keep an eye out, after all, you wouldn&#039;t want to be &#039;mean&#039;&nbsp; and &#039;racist&#039;, just another sap paying for bums to make&nbsp; someone&nbsp; feel better who is either&nbsp; in the Bahamas, gated&nbsp; community or some high rise, who made a law siding with street people.&nbsp; &nbsp;
