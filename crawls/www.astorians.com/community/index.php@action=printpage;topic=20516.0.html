				I got forwarded this and thought I&#039;d pass it along here. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I&#039;m Tired<br /><br />By Robert A. Hall<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m 63. Except for one semester in college when jobs were scarce and a<br />six-month period when I was between jobs, but job-hunting every day, I&#039;ve<br />worked, hard, since I was 18. Despite some health challenges, I still put in<br />50-hour weeks, and haven&#039;t called in sick in seven or eight years. I make a<br />good salary, but I didn&#039;t inherit my job or my income, and I worked to get<br />where I am. Given the economy, there&#039;s no retirement in sight, and I&#039;m<br />tired. Very tired.<br /><br />I&#039;m tired of being told that I have to &quot;spread the wealth&quot; to people who<br />don&#039;t have my work ethic. I&#039;m tired of being told the government will take<br />the money I earned, by force if necessary, and give it to people too lazy to<br />earn it.<br /><br />I&#039;m tired of being told that Islam is a &quot;Religion of Peace,&quot; when every day<br />I can read dozens of stories of Muslim men killing their sisters, wives and<br />daughters for their family &quot;honour&quot;; of Muslims rioting over some slight<br />offense; of Muslims murdering Christian, Hindus and Jews because they aren&#039;t<br />&quot;believers&quot;; of Muslims burning schools for girls; of Muslims stoning<br />teenage rape victims to death for &quot;adultery&quot;; of Muslims mutilating the<br />genitals of little girls; all in the name of Allah, because the Qur&#039;an and<br />Sharia law tells them to.<br /><br />I&#039;m tired of being told that out of &quot;tolerance for other cultures&quot; we must<br />let Saudi Arabia use our oil money to fund mosques and mandrassa Islamic<br />schools to preach hate in America and Canada , while no American nor<br />Canadian group is allowed to fund a church, synagogue or religious school in<br />Saudi Arabia to teach love and tolerance.<br /><br />I&#039;m tired of being told I must lower my living standard to fight global<br />warming, which no one is allowed to debate.<br /><br />I&#039;m tired of being told that drug addicts have a disease, and I must help<br />support and treat them, and pay for the damage they do. Did a giant germ<br />rush out of a dark alley, grab them, and stuff white powder up their noses<br />while they tried to fight it off?<br /><br />I&#039;m tired of hearing wealthy athletes, entertainers, and politicians of both<br />parties talking about innocent mistakes, stupid mistakes, or youthful<br />mistakes, when we all know they think their only mistake was getting caught.<br />I&#039;m tired of people with a sense of entitlement, rich or poor.<br /><br />I&#039;m real tired of people who don&#039;t take responsibility for their lives and<br />actions. I&#039;m tired of hearing them blame the government, or discrimination<br />or big-whatever for their problems.<br /><br />Yes, I&#039;m damn tired. But I&#039;m also glad to be 63. Because, mostly, I&#039;m not<br />going to have to see the world these people are making. I&#039;m just really sorry for<br />my grandchildren.<br /><br />Robert A. Hall is a Marine Vietnam veteran who served five terms in the<br />Massachusetts State Senate.<br /><br />There is no way this will be widely publicized, unless each of us sends it<br />on! This is your chance to make a difference. &quot; I&#039;m 63 and I&#039;m tired.<br />If you don&#039;t forward this you are part of the problem.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />
