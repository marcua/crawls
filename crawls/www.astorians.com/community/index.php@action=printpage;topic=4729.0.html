				With the caveat this is NOT in Astoria-<br />I had incredible vegetarian Caribbean food in South Richmond Hill.&nbsp; It was at a place called &quot;Veggie Castle II&quot; on Liberty Ave. near the Van Wyck.&nbsp; We had faux oxtail, jerk chicken, ginger chicken drumsticks, mac and cheese, rice and black-eyed peas, etc.&nbsp; It was one of the best fake-meat experiences I&#39;ve ever had (on the level of Veggie Dim Sum).&nbsp; And cheap as all get out (for seven bucks we got two entrees and two sides, which were lovingly heaped into a pie-tin container).&nbsp; We had to eat in the car, though, as there was nowhere to eat (there was one stool in the place, I think).&nbsp; Sybil&#39;s bakery next door was also quite good!

				I haven&#39;t been, but I&#39;ve seen a large Caribbean food store on maybe Newtown Avenue or thereabouts, close to 21st Street... a pretty desolate area, and it kinda looks like a stripmall, but they had signs up for their jerk chicken. Anyone know what I&#39;m talking about?

				That&#39;s true, but the poster asked about Astoria and I don&#39;t think Astoria can satisfy all culinary tastes of every spectrum nor should it have to.&nbsp; But I don&#39;t think the poster was saying Astoria should have to either, they were just asking if there were any places that serve Carribean food in Astoria.&nbsp; Perhaps I should clarify what I said to mean that for some foods you will have to travel outside of Astoria to get it, whether Queens, Brooklyn, Manhattan, or anywhere really.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)

				Looking at Zagat.com&nbsp; The only listing for &quot;Jerk&quot; is in Phili.&nbsp; I can&#39;t believe not one NY Jamaican place made it into Zagat.
