				....is smelling way worse than usual this time of year. Phil the groundhog may tell how long winter may be, but the stench from 31st street in May is usually a good indication of how hot the summer will be. I went for a jog this morning at like 5:30, and it was nauseating.

				The Stench is back! I noticed it yesterday driving back from work as soon as I got offf GCP at 82 ST. Right by Rikers - worse than ever! This year it&#039;s like dead decaying&nbsp; bodies - or some fat rendering plant. It&#039;s travelling down twds Ditmars. REally the worst and summer is only starting. Oye Veey :-o

				i feel awful for all of you up there having to smell that.<br />this would really put a damper on a picnic in the park huh?<br /><br />has anyone called 311 to report it? or contacted the local politician. It&#039;s Giannaris up that way correct?

				It is very nauseating.&nbsp; I want to start running again, but I&#039;m fearing this smell might just make me keel over and die.&nbsp; Yech!!!<br /><br />How would one stop the smell though?&nbsp; What is it from- a garbage dump?

				I&#039;ve smelled really bad stuff over by the park though, on previous runs.&nbsp; The smell of &quot;crap&quot; seems to flow over the water, as if from a sewer or garbage dump.&nbsp; I would think it only gets worse in summer.&nbsp; I&#039;m going to try and start running again next week.&nbsp; I&#039;ll report back if the smell has returned over that way.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-P

				Just&nbsp; reported it to 311. The operator initially went to transfer me to 911 - even after I told her it was not a 911 call. She then more appropriately transferred me to DEP and gave me a complaint number #1630053. Let&#039;s see what happens.
