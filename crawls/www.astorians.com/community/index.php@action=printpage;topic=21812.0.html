				We found a dirty cat at around Ditmars and 36th -- adult, not skinny, with a rather mangled looking face. He (?) was mostly white with splotches of gray, and a striped gray and black tail. We&#039;re worried about him, so please let me know if you see him anywhere...we fed him a can of Friskies (which he gulped down in 10 seconds) and later went back to try to get him but he was gone. :( Poor thing looked like he&#039;d had a rough life. Friendly though, so he might have been once owned by someone.

				I&#039;ve been seeing a lot of cats around Ditmars this year and get the impression many of them are strays. I think I&#039;ve even seen the cat you describe a couple times. On 27th Street, there&#039;s a cat couple that hangs out between Ditmars and 23rd Ave. If you stand there staring at them, they walk towards you and say hello. One time I stood there cat-talking to them for a couple minutes and then one followed me down the sidewalk for a bit. One of them is polydactyl or has double paws, the other one is more sociable. They seem really friendly but I also get the impression they&#039;re strays, and someone leaves food out for them on their front step.

They&#039;re definitely not feral. I&#039;m not sure if the people in the house where they&#039;re fed owns them or not. I think my landlord knows those people so I&#039;ll ask. If they don&#039;t own them, I&#039;m trapping them, taking them to the vet to see if they&#039;re chipped, and if not, trying to find a home for them. It&#039;s getting a bit cold out there for felines that aren&#039;t feral. <br /><br />(I already have two cats, 2 more would be a bit much - pretty sure i can find a home though)

				I know this is an old thread, but I just found it. Im also in 27th &amp; Ditmars and I&#039;ve been eyeing those cats since last summer. Did anyone find out if they have owners? They&#039;re too cute and friendly to not be taken in.
