				I have only ever had one physical therapist - but I&#039;ve &quot;used&quot; her for many different injuries (broken bones, plantar fascitis).&nbsp; I have watched other people get PT from others (not her) and I was appalled.&nbsp; I HIGHLY recommend Tamar Amitay of Thrive PT.&nbsp; Her office is in the Cable Building on Houston and Broadway.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />She&#039;s very hands on - which is important - painful, but important.&nbsp; Other PT&#039;s I&#039;ve watched put on a heat or cold pack or maybe do a little stim or ultrasound.&nbsp; Tamar is really into ergonomics and fascial release and whatever else you need.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Susan is a PT who works at Thrive and she&#039;s very good, too.&nbsp; My dad saw her after back surgery and she really helped him.

				Thanks to this board, I was put in touch with the Hospital for Special Surgery. Not local, a schlep in fact, but totally worth it. They were caring and supportive but put me through my paces as you should. After severely breaking my arm at the shoulder three years ago, with hard work and their excellent care I got full mobility back. Can&#039;t say enough good things about them. Good luck!
