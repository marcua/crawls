				OK, where can we get good tacos in Astoria?&nbsp; My understanding so far:<br /><br />Yummy al pastor tacos at Original Mexican Food<br />Tasty al pastor tacos at this place on Broadway (I forget the name but it&#39;s not Los Portales)<br />I hear Los Portales has good tacos.<br />And then there&#39;s the 30th Ave taco truck.<br /><br />Any others?

				Here&#39;s a good thread on the subject at Chowhound: http://www.chowhound.com/topics/show/248760<br /><br />I heartilly recommend the tacos at Tacos Mexico and at this one other place which I&#39;m unsure of the name, but it&#39;s on Broadway between 29th St. and Crescent - right next to Baskin Robbins. It looks like a deli, but they have tables and you can order take-out in the back. The $2 tacos are awesome, and the staff is quite nice too.

				Oooooh, this sounds like such an excellent idea! I would love to join.

Maybe I could get them to drop me off in taco-landia!<br /><br />I wonder where in the taco crawl you will be by 8:30. I would think you might be at the taco truck or on your way to Tacos Mexico already, no?? I&#39;ll see if I can swing by and join you guys!

Or I&#39;ll just head over to Tacos Mexico, get a margarita and some chow, and just sit and wait for you guys to come rolling in!

				Thanks for the link, Flooz!<br />Yes, I can seriously vouch for Los Portales.<br />ALL varieties of tacos are great and they&#39;re actually cheaper than El Rey (not to make comparisons).<br />Let&#39;s not talk about the <strong>suadero</strong> (veal shoulder) taco. Its <em>too good</em>. And no one else has it but them!<br />The hardest part will be to choose tacos over <span class="bbc_u">tortas</span>, because their tortas are AWESOME.<br />The key, I think is the fresh <em>papalo</em> they use (Mexican clovery bitter herb like cilantro)<br />They also have a GARDEN PATIO, go out there to eat and you&#39;re totally in-the-know.<br />NB: no cervezas!<br /><br />see you all on the crawl!

				Annie, you are full of awesome taco-y information!&nbsp; Yes, I saw they have a patio out back, niiiiiiice!<br /><br />Yes, the tacos there are super cheap.&nbsp; $1.50.&nbsp; Tacos at Original Mexican Food are $2.00.&nbsp; What are they at El Rey and Tacos Mexicos?<br /><br />LOS PORTALES RULES BECAUSE THEY HAVE HORCHATA.&nbsp; <br />.

I&#39;d suggest age, gender, area of personal origin (New York, Southwest US, Mexico, other US, not US or Mexico), fluency in Spanish (nada, poquito, si), dietary preference (omnivore, no pork, vegetarian, vegan), Astoria sub-neighborhood (Ditmars, Astoria Blvd to Broadway, Broadway South), and favorite Mexican beer (Dos Equis, Corona, Tecate, Other, Tequila).

				Fantastical idea, Harlan.<br />I agree that there could be incredible statistical power in this score sheet!<br />The chi-squared test should be interesting.<br />I think for clarity, we could just have one score card, per person, per restaurant/eatery. That way, you could just total up all scores by Taco Crawl Stop. Besides, some people may succumb to taco delirium and lose their score cards if charged with holding them the entire time. This way, you could collect scores between stops (people fill them out as they walk then hand them in to a collector). <br />The fact that Los Portales is first could prove to exhibit some intriguing data artifacts (will people compare all subsequent tacos to it?)<br />Totally dorky. Totally awesome.

				My humble Taco Hypothesis is that Astorians will get totally stuffed with tacos, thereby eliminating any room available for beer and thus rendering that dimension unnecessary for data collection!

				Taco Crawl II will be organized after Taco Crawl I is over.&nbsp; The thing about Taco Crawl I, is that all the places are a sure thing as far as deliciousness.&nbsp; They are known entities, in that various numbers of astorians have checked them out.&nbsp; Taco Crawl II will be more exploratory, venturing to taco places are are perhaps less well-known to the astorians crowd.&nbsp; Very exciting!

				I&#39;d be shocked if the local media would cover this, in all honesty. &nbsp;What would be the interest angle? &nbsp;I know I haven&#39;t contacted the media, and don&#39;t intend to - I think it&#39;s just a social event and should stay that way. &nbsp;I think it was a joke comment. &nbsp;If the media was contacted, and did show, I think they would respect our request not to cover the Taco Crawl if we made such a request.

				It does sound like there&#39;s a significant opposition... Hopefully NYCMU can get ahold of whomever she talked to. If not, well, if someone from the press does show up, we can just tell them to go away; I&#39;m sure they will. This isn&#39;t a big deal... <br /><br />Back on-topic, I&#39;ve seen a draft of Flooz&#39;s survey form. Brilliant work, as always!&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />And also on-topic, for those who wish some pre-crawl reading, the Wikipedia entry on tacos (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taco) is actually pretty informative!

				I still don&#39;t see why the press would cover it or find it interesting - it&#39;s just a group of people eating tacos. &nbsp;I could be wrong, but I would be surprised if they did cover it. &nbsp;Usually to get them to something you have to have it listed in the Associated Press daybook and send a media advisory, as well as follow up with phone calls, unless they&#39;re really desperate for stories. &nbsp;I think if any reporter were or are planning to come, they should be asked not to come, out of respect for people&#39;s wishes.

				It&#39;s actually a minor aspect of the episode.&nbsp; The Simpsons inherit money from their great-aunt, and each one of them gets 100 dollars.&nbsp; Bart says he wants to spend his money on the 100-tacos for 100 dollars special at a restaurant in Springfield.&nbsp; His parents won&#39;t let him (but we see comic book guy leaving with a wheelbarrow full of tacos).&nbsp; Bart opens a checking account, and when he writes a check to Krusty to try to get his autograph, the check is returned to him with the stamp of an off-shore holding company in the Cayman islands.&nbsp; Krusty is unmasked as a tax evader, and fakes his own death and assumes a new identity.&nbsp; Then Bart and Lisa convince him to go back to being Krusty....and everything is back to normal!<br />&nbsp;:roll:

				Holy crap, I hadn&#39;t read this topic in a few days - I had no idea how big this had gotten! <br /><br />Flooz, whatEVER would we do without your mad designing skillz? Those stickers are RAD. And I sincerely hope to meet your big lug! I hope he can come. <br /><br />I definitely won&#39;t be able to make Los Portales -- I&#39;ll likely have to come in between Original Mex and El Rey (both of which straddle my 30th Ave. stop), so it&#39;ll be easy to find you I&#39;m sure - I&#39;ll just look for the MOB of taco eating fools with everyone stopping to stare at them! Should someone warn these establishments that we&#39;re coming? I know both Original Mex and El Rey are very mom and pop - no more than 2 folks usually cooking and serving, etc.<br /><br />On that note, no real way to warn El Rey, seeing as how it&#39;s a truck. Oh well!<br /><br />(edited for typo - my excitement=bad editing!)

				Yes yes and yes! Just to add more warm fuzzies - I&#39;m SO glad I made it out last night, even though I had to miss the first two spots! I was really debating whether or not to come, since I was tired from a long day of work &amp; coming from Brooklyn, but you guys just made my night! I arrived home happy and sated.&nbsp; :-D<br /><br />It was wonderful to meet Astorians, and of course to wear proudly the I &lt;3 Astoria and Taco Crawl stickers. Great job, Flooz, on those. Thanks for organizing also MegC. And thanks to Dirk for taking on the complex job of taking orders &amp; money at the taco truck!<br /><br />I can&#39;t wait for the next Astorians event, to meet more of you! And for Taco Crawl II.

				Ahh, I wish I&#39;d taken a look at this thread a week ago; I&#39;d have come on the crawl.&nbsp; I&#39;ve been to all the places the crawl has been to, and here&#39;s what I think:<br /><br />-- los portales: best <em>al pastor</em> in nyc and the <em>suadero </em> tacos are just as good.&nbsp; <em>carnitas</em> are very eh.&nbsp; really like the vibe there.&nbsp; wish they were open sunday nights.<br /><br />-- tacos mexico: pretty good all around, but not best in class of anything; I rarely go, because there are places i like better.<br /><br />-- original mex food (formerly &quot;hidalgo grocery&quot;) on 29th: most things are bland and uninspired but otherwise perfectly fine.&nbsp; i used to go there frequently for tamales on the weekend lunch, but then i figured out that i just wanted to go back to sleep after eating them.&nbsp; they are about as good as you can get in nyc, but that&#39;s not saying a whole lot.<br /><br />-- taco truck on 30th.&nbsp; i don&#39;t like them much.&nbsp; there is much better food in nearby restaurants imho, and the trucks in woodside and along the 7 train are much better if you need taco truck cache.&nbsp; <br /><br />i also have a recommendation for y&#39;all; a place i have recently found that has some really good things:<br /><br />-- blue on 30th (just east of steinway).&nbsp; carnitas are very good.&nbsp; i&#39;d recommend the cemita!&nbsp; also they are nice there, you can sit down and take your time.&nbsp; and they have a full diner menu if your roommate doesn&#39;t want mexican.<br /><br />

				Yes, De Mole is new. <br />I helped organize the original taco crawl. Actually, I came up with the idea.&nbsp; :cool: <br /><br /><br />Here is a post over on We Heart Astoria - that I also helped to research - about the wonderful taco scene in Astoria, from places a little off the beaten path. The queso tacos from La Cabana haunt my dreams in a very good way. They are my current favorite taco spot.<br /><br /><br />http://weheartastoria.com/2012/09/unsung-tacos-of-astoria-western-queens-overlooked-mexican-mecca/

				De Mole is on 30th near.... maybe 42nd? It&#039;s on that side of 30th. La Cabana is a little market, actually, that makes tacos. 30th Ave and 34th Street. Now I&#039;m hungry.&nbsp; :smiley:
