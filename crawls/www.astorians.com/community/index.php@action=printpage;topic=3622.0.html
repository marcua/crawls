				We went to the Central Park Zoo today and saw some awesome animals. The polar bears were really cute, huge but cute; penguins were really fun to watch swimming then launching themselves back to the rocks. They have a pretty good Tropical Rain Forest exhibit with beautiful birds, an animal called a deer mouse (which is neither a deer nor mouse, very strange with pencil-like legs and is the smallest known hooved-animal), several species of tamarinds, snakes, those giant Madagascar Roaches (which I steered well clear of) and other interesting creatures. It was pretty busy so I&#39;m looking forward to going back in the winter when there are fewer tourists/families (those strollers are a killer). The zoo is actually open 365 days a year and one of the Zoo employees was telling me about how playful the &quot;snow&quot; monkeys and polar bears are in the winter. She pointed out the giant (to me anyway) bats that hang from the ceiling - they have like a 3-foot wingspan! Freaky! They also have a glassed-in display for these tiny little bats with a tiny Rhinocerous-type horn growing out of their nose that helps them navigate. Had to feed the sheep/llamas/goats at the Children&#39;s Zoo - they are sooooo cute! It&#39;s hilarious to me though that they have a cow on display! And people were really excited about it! <br /><br />Can&#39;t compare to big zoos but for a couple of hours it&#39;s a great place to visit. The walk through the park afterwards was great too. They are doing extensive restoration work at Bethesda Terrace and the outcome should be impressive. And, damn, I think some of those people around &quot;Imagine&quot; in Strawberry Fields are still tripping from acid they took in like 1976. I liked John Lennon too, but geez.....move ON! <br /><br />We headed to one of my favorite places - Zabar&#39;s - to do some sampling and get a couple of things. Of course it was a nightmare there but well worth the trip. If you ever get a chance sample the smoked salmon pate - deeeelish! And since we were in the neighborhood we HAD to go to Gray&#39;s Papaya - yummy and cheap. It always comes back to food........<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; :-)&nbsp; :-) I love New York&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; :-)

I went there a few years ago, and as far as I remember, it definitely bore signs of neglect - though it is nice to support the institutions of our fair borough...
