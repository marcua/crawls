				Hey guys! I have a coworker who&#039;s birthday is coming up. I&#039;m in charge of getting a cake for her. She always eats really healthy food, she&#039;ll snack on carrots and tomatoes and fruit but I haven&#039;t seen her eat anything unhealthy. I was wondering what kind of cake to get her and thought a fruit tart might be good. Do you guys know any good places to get a fruit tart or other equally healthy cake type product in Astoria? Thanks in advance!

				Ha Ha healthy cake like product! That&#039;s funny, all cakes are healthy. Eggs, milk, butter (hopefully not crisco), are very nutritious. LaGuli has wonderful fruit tarts. They&#039;re delicious as well as beautiful to look at---if they&#039;re fresh. I don&#039;t know what is the best day to shop there for pastry-maybe the end of the week or weekend- and I don&#039;t know how to check the freshness without plucking off a piece of fruit or sticking your finger into the filling and tasting it.<br /><br /><br />Maybe your carrot eating friend would enjoy a carrot cake? I had a slice of Stew Leonard&#039;s pumpkin pie with light whipped cream yesterday and it was deevine! Didn&#039;t seem heavy at all, but I guess most people prefer it around Thanksgiving.

				Martha&#039;s. But fruit tarts aren&#039;t healthy. The crust is mostly butter and it is glazed with simple syrup. Does she eat carbs?

				You&#039;re right Foxywiles no cakes are healthy- not even fruit tarts, but I think she&#039;ll probably be thrilled with a big beautiful birthday fruit tart/cake from her coworkers. She isn&#039;t allergic to cake is she?

				Astor Bake Shop is pretty awesome, too. It won&#039;t be cheap, but it will be delicious.
