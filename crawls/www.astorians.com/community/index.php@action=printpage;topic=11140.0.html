				Has anyone been to Linn Restaurant yet?&nbsp; the menu looks fantastic and I read that the chef might be from Masa.&nbsp; I almost missed it when I walked by as you might not even notice it is a restaurant.&nbsp; any reviews?

				It is definitely Japanese cuisine. I have not eaten there myself- though I pass it on a daily basis and it seems to be pretty busy.<br /><br />I peaked at the menu when it first opened and in my in my opinion it seemed to be a little on the pricey side-but I would like to check it out eventually. <br /><br />The old Japanese restaurant that was in that space was called Shima.

				We went there a few weeks ago, the food was very good, well prepared with a little bit more care and precision than your average local Japanese place. It was a little pricey, but they didn&#039;t seem to have a liquor license yet, so we saved on that.<br /><br />my only real gripe is that the menu didn&#039;t seem very adventurous, though the fried oysters were extremely good.<br /><br />The decor inside is very nice, but I think that wall is a mistake.

				The food is good.<br /><br />My worry about the wall is that it seems to turn a lot of people off, and will keep people from just walking in. but if word of mouth gets around I&#039;m sure they will do alright.<br /><br />

				ok, that chowhound thread just really annoyed me. <br /><br />What is the point, on a website devoted to food, of having a bunch of people (who have never tried a restaurant!) gripe about how they heard from someone else (who is not posting about their experience at all) that the place was not good?<br /><br />now I remember why I never go there...

				I finally made it here last night and we were VERY impressed.&nbsp; That wall with the surf movie and the &quot;art&quot; make it visually odd but the food was outstanding - for Queens Japanese.&nbsp; I&#039;ve stopped eating Japanese in Astoria because I&#039;m consistently disappointed.&nbsp; We now have a place to go!&nbsp; I highly recommend the appetizer Yellowtail Jalapeno - WOW&nbsp; :lol:

				I was first intimidated by the wall but also intrigued.&nbsp; I&#039;ve sat down for dinner a couple of times at Linn and have been very satisfied.

				my boyfriend and i have been here a couple times and were very impressed each time. the fish is very fresh, the sushi rice is warm and well seasoned. the yellowtail collar appetizer is amazing. we&#039;ve sat at the sushi bar both times and found the sushi chef to be very friendly. each time putting a piece of fish on our plate that we should try. they have fresh wasabi, not the weird pasty stuff. i highly recommend this place, probably the best quality sushi in the area. definitely a huge step above jj&#039;s, watawa and bistro 33. check it out!

				I went there in late Spring a few weeks after it opened &amp; once since.&nbsp; Service was truly awful the first time - after waiting over an hour we asked if we could cancel orders &amp; leave, but just got general looks of confusion due to language barrier &amp; stayed out of guilt.&nbsp; Second time around sat at the counter &amp; things were much improved from a service standpoint.<br /><br />The menu is pretty limited, which for me is a good thing since I get overwhelmed with multi-page tombs of choices &amp; am often reduced to saying &#039;I don&#039;t know&#039; when asked what I want &amp; then have food envy of my dining companions when they make better choices.&nbsp; But I digress...food is nice - kinda expensive and a bit more traditional Japanese with a focus on sushi/sashimi rather than a lot of other places that cater to the spicy tuna roll penchant of many American sushi-goers.&nbsp; <br /><br />At first was put off my the odd decorating, but it&#039;s grown on me.&nbsp; <br /><br />I thought Shima was awful, so a welcome change, but for me Linn is too pricey &amp; inconsistent to become my staple sushi establishment (that will remain JJs)

				I checked out Linn last night. The place wasn&#039;t packed, but pretty lively considering it was a Sunday night. <br />When you look into the place, theres a huge white wall which reminded me like I was walking into a gallery. The interior design is nice, and I thought the food was above the average Japanese restaurants in the area. I don&#039;t think this place needs to expand on the number of items on the menu, but rather the options within &quot;chef specials.&quot; With a chef who has worked in a renowned Japanese restaurant, I would like to see menu items, ingredients or combination&nbsp; I haven&#039;t seen before at Japanese restaurants. The service was on par as well. Food came out quick, and our waitress was attentive. <br />One more critique would be the lighting. I like warm lighting, the restaurant leans towards &quot;cool&quot; lighting. Though it made everything seem clean, I prefer dim and warm lighting. <br /><br />Also, the space holds artwork, which probably explains the whole &quot;gallery&quot; look. The artwork was cool. I did some research and found out the artist info here... http://www.thenoneart.com/<br />Pretty cool that they are embracing street art as I am a fan. Will go back soon and try other menu items.
