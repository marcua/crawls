				Been in Astoria for over 4 years.&nbsp; And a good non-ghetto mens haircut is hard to come by.&nbsp; <br /><br />My favorite place is on 30th Ave across from NYSC but the good guys don&#039;t get in till 2pm.<br /><br />I tried the new place on 23rd Ave and 27th street and it was HORRIBLE!!.<br /><br />Is there anywhere in the Ditmars area that can give a good Sat A.M. conservative mens haircut???<br /><br />

				It does seem like it is harder for men than women to find a decent haircut.&nbsp; Why is that?

				&nbsp;<br />Lift Salon.&nbsp; It&#039;s on 24th Avenue, around 27th St (??), fairly new.&nbsp; Joe and I have both had our hair cut there and been very happy.<br /><br />On a separate note they do a great pedicure too.&nbsp; Oh and you get a glass of wine&nbsp; &nbsp;:mrgreen:

				I go to the Place between Taverna Kyclades (sp?) and the gyro place on Ditmars and 33rd (Acropolis side).&nbsp; Ask for Alex. He works there with his other brother and their father.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been going there for several years and have never had a problem.

				Here&#039;s the secret to a great Saturday A.M. haircut.&nbsp; Buy clippers.&nbsp; Buzz your head.&nbsp; Yay!&nbsp; &nbsp;:evil:<br /><br />I&#039;ve been cutting my own for about 8 years.&nbsp; Very convenient and super cheap.<br /><br />Or, you could always buy a Flowbee...<br /><br />(http://www.flowbee.com/images/webproduct%20shot%20copy.jpg)

				On the recommendation of a bunch of people, I went to Saloon on 30th for a haircut there.&nbsp; I thought it sucked.&nbsp; The lady did a pretty crappy job trimming my hair just a little bit, it cost me like $30 and everyone seemed snooty and pissy.<br /><br />I went to She Goes to Your Head on Steinway Street between (I think) 30th and 31st avenue today.&nbsp; And for like $12, they just did a simple trim pretty quickly and were cool and did a nice little job.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if anyone else has tried this place or has strong feelings about it, but I was impressed and it&#039;s where I&#039;ll go for those Saturday morning men&#039;s haircuts from now on.<br /><br />MW.

				I don&#039;t exactly know what you mean by a &#039;ghetto&#039; haircut but there are plenty of decent barbershops in Astoria. I usually go to Eddie at the shop across the street from Tradefair on Ditmars. Val&#039;s place on 23rd Avenue and 32nd Street is my back-up. Both open early on the weekends.&nbsp;
