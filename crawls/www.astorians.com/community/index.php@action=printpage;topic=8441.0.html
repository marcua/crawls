				My friends know I like to play pool (a lot) so they bought me a new book that just came out. It is called Painting on Green Canvas.&nbsp; It&#039;s this really cool story.&nbsp; &nbsp; It reminded me of The Legend of Bagger Vance when I was reading it, except it was about pool.&nbsp; If you do play the game you can learn to play better. My break shot improved a lot after reading it.&nbsp; I told my friend who doesn&#039;t play and she now wants to learn. I gave it to another friend and they read it in one night.&nbsp; The characters are so believable I was surprised that it wasn&#039;t true.&nbsp; You can order from Borders or Barnes&amp;Nobles.

				How can you say something is wrong,if first time posters are adding to this forum! If are knowledge of the book has brought us here and added to the site why is this wrong? i myself and several others as u can plainly see have found this book an enjoyable experience..we all know each other and simply wish to share with others the benefit of the story...i plan on telling 100 people nationwide via another forum to purchase the book.

				While it is plausible that one person is posting all this &quot;crap&quot;, they still have a right to as this is an open forum. But it is&nbsp; somewhat suspicious. <br /><br />&nbsp; That being said, if they really wish to &quot;plug the book&quot; maybe they should do it on amazon.com since there isn&#039;t even a single review for it there.<br /><br /><br /><br />

Government should be restrained from intervening at home or abroad because its actions fail to achieve their stated aims, create more harm than good, shrink the liberty of the people, and violate rights. Does that proposition seem radical? Outlandish or farflung? Once you hear it stated, it makes perfect sense that there is no sharp distinction between the principles of domestic and foreign policy. They are part of the same analytical fabric. What would be inconsistent would be to favor activist government at home but restraint abroad, or the reverse: restraint at home and activism abroad. Government unleashed behaves in its own interests, and will not restrict itself in any area of life. It must be curbed in all areas of life lest freedom suffer. Ron Paul&#039;s singular voice on foreign affairs has done so much to keep the flame of a consistent liberty burning in times when it might otherwise have been extinguished. He has drawn public attention to the ideas of the Founders. He has alerted people to the dangers of empire. He has linked domestic and foreign affairs through libertarian analytics, even when others have been bamboozled by the lies or too intimidated to contradict them. He has told the truth, always. For this, every American, every citizen of the world, is deeply in his debt. We can&#039;t but be deeply grateful that Ron Paul&#039;s prophetic words have been collected in this book. May it be widely distributed. May its lessons be absorbed by this and future generations.<br /><br /><br />
