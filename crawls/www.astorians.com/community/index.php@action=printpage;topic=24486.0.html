				About a week ago, I was cleaning out my garage and threw out some old furniture in the hopes that someone could use everything. The next morning things were gone and I was happy.<br /><br />A few days later, I am walking by the 2nd best thrift shop, and there was one of the pieces I threw out. It was actually being sold. I asked the person working how much, and they told me $45. I laughed and told her that it was actually a piece that I put on the curb a few nights before.<br /><br />Just so you are aware that they are selling people&#039;s garbage instead of allowing people from the neighborhood to use it.<br /><br />&nbsp;:angry: <br />

				Well anybody has the right to take whatever somebody throws out on the street.&nbsp; They didn&#039;t break any laws and what you consider to be garbage somebody else might really like

				I noticed people destroy things before they toss it out to prevent people from re-selling but it sucks for people who can use it who cannot afford it,<br />on the other hand<br />You can make money at a thrift shop if you have a good eye, i found a used sought after button up shirt for $28 and sold it online for $148....

				If you donate your old stuff to the thrift shop on Ditmars, they&#039;ll give you a receipt for your taxes.&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing the money from selling your stuff goes to the church on the receipt.
