				We lived up in Buffalo around 1980-&#39;81, just for a year, and my sister &amp; I were so excited- it snows all the time! No more school, <em>ever!!</em>&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />Turned out to be exactly the opposite: They&#39;re ready for snow upstate, and there was no such thing as &quot;snow days.&quot;&nbsp; :cry:<br /><br />Still, all that snow kicked ass for us kids.

				I think it&#39;s supposed to snow all night tonight and then tomorrow will be freezing rain and sleet...more messy and wet than a huge snow fall.&nbsp; You&#39;ll probably be fine for your trip to PR but just in case maybe I should go in your place. :-)

				We have a guy on our block with a (er, I don&#39;t know what they are called) - ATV?&nbsp; 4-wheeler kind of thing.&nbsp; Anyway, when it snows more than a few inches, he plows the sidewalks on both sides of the street for the entire block!&nbsp; It&#39;s awesome.&nbsp; &nbsp;8-)<br /><br />It was snowing at work today -- looking out the window from the 34th floor.&nbsp; It snowed up there last July, too.&nbsp; We went out for Valentine&#39;s Day dinner tonight (yes, I know, a day early, but without the jacked up prices, stressed waitstaff and chefs, or overbooked restaurants that rush you out to get the next seating in), and when we left (near the Flatiron building), it was just the right side of snow with a tiny bit of sleet mixed in.&nbsp; It was almost snowing enough to cap off a romantic evening.<br /><br />I hate the cold, but I love snow.&nbsp; To me, the only justification whatsoever for cold weather is SNOW!!!!!

				Dear Mr. Bloomberg:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I woke up this morning and was so happy to see how well our tax dollars are being spent.&nbsp; It was nice to see that the streets have not been plowed, the salt trucks were not out and it was fantastic to see cars sliding all over the place and the bus service up to par at being on time every 40 minutes during rush hour.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I was a wonderful feeling knowing that my tax dollars are being so well invested.&nbsp; Last year &quot;we were prepared&quot;, seems like it was all spent LAST YEAR?<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Once again, thank you for spending everyone&#39;s hard earned money to our benefit.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sincerely,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A Tax Payer
