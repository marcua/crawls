				Master bedroom (approx. 10.5’ x 13.5’) in an AMAZING 3BR newly renovated apartment in Astoria, only 3 stops from Manhattan! The room has 2 closets (!!) and can easily fit a queen-size bed, book cases, shelving, and a computer desk and still there is plenty of space. Our long-time roommate is moving out and we are looking for a responsible, chill, respectful, reasonably clean, and employed roommate who can hold a conversation but also has their own thing going on. Here are the details: <br /><br />- 3 level house; 3 separate apartments; terrace; backyard (we LOVE to grill) in a clean and safe neighborhood. <br /><br />- Recessed lighting throughout house, nice bathroom, large kitchen with brand new stainless steel appliances and dishwasher (woo-hoo!!) <br /><br />- Your room (the master bedroom) is situated in the rear of the house and right off of the bathroom and next to the kitchen, so there&#039;s relative privacy <br /><br />- Heat, hot water included, utilities, cable (with DVR), and high-speed wireless internet included. There is also a cable jack in your bedroom if you want to have your own TV in your room! (you would be responsible for extra cable box charges) <br /><br />- TONS of storage in this house; 2 closets in the bedroom; more closet space on the first floor; plus linen closet <br /><br />- Super fast and easy commute via the N/W train (we&#039;re right off of the 36th Ave stop) <br /><br />- Nearby restaurants, grocery stores, great bars, stores, movie theater, gyms a short walk away, laundromat on the corner. Plenty of on-the-street parking! <br /><br />You would be living with 2 clean (1 male, 1 female), responsible, easy-going professionals in the creative fields with active social lives. Everyone in the building is fun, open-minded, busy with their own social lives, and responsible. We also have a friendly female cat, and are open to the possibility of you adding your friendly well-behaved feline into our home, if it’s the right fit. <br /><br />Please be willing to provide personal references, 1-month security deposit and 1st month’s rent up-front. The room is available for as early as November 15th move-in date (we could pro-rate any portion of November after the 15th), but we definitely need to find someone by December 1st. <br />Please email kbprez@hotmail.com for pictures, more details, etc.! <br /><br />&nbsp;:mrgreen:<br />
