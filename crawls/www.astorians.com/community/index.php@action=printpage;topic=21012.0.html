				Hi, I&#039;m leaving a month-to-month.&nbsp; I am sending the landlord the requisite 30 days notice via registered letter.&nbsp; I have two roommates.&nbsp; I pay the landlord and they pay me.&nbsp; I spoke to the landlord this evening just to give him an oral heads-up.&nbsp; I am paying the rent here through the end of June (overlapping with the new place).<br /><br />He wants to meet the roommate who will take over as the person who pays the landlord.&nbsp; If the landlord doesn&#039;t consent to him taking over, what are my obligations?&nbsp; The landlord says that I have to turn over the place empty.&nbsp; Am I required to give the 30-days notice to the other two roommates if the landlord doesn&#039;t accept one of them as tenants?&nbsp; He says so.&nbsp; If they were to holdover past the end of June despite my notice, am I still liable for the rent and am I required to do eviction proceedings?<br /><br />I&#039;m seeking general advice but I suspect I need to line up the name of a good landlord-tenant lawyer in the vicinity of Ditmars and 31st St.&nbsp; I&#039;d greatly appreciate any input of either kind. <br /><br />Thanks.<br />

				Not a lawyer here, but you might have squatter rights. I had a roomie who refused to leave once I gave her notice to get out, and she was able to stay for 3 extra months (rent free might I add) due to squatter rights. (if you live in an apartment for over a certain amount of time, I believe it is 4 months, then there are legal;proceedings that must be had in order to remove the &quot;tenant&quot; aka squatter). Not sure if the same applies to month to month though. i.e, the roomies may not have to leave when the landlord wants them out. His problem, not yours.
