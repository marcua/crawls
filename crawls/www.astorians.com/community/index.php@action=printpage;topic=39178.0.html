				I saw the Falafel King truck parked on Ditmars &amp; 31st right near the Starbucks.&nbsp; I heard such good things about this food truck, I will have to try it one day.

				Try it!&nbsp; It&#039;s really great.&nbsp; The halal cart around the corner (in front of the Capital One bank) had better step up their game.&nbsp; the last three times i asked them for Falafel, they said they were out.

				I tried it on Saturday and it was really good.&nbsp; I got the falafel on a pita.&nbsp; The falafel was great.&nbsp; I&#039;ll definitely be getting this again.

				It is great. However, the Halal butcher Al Nour on 30 Ave and 42st has an amazing Lebanese style falafel and other kebab sandwiches for $4 and $5. Check em out.

				Kinda weird that there are people who have lived in Astoria that have never tried it. The truck was in the same spot on Broadway for 15 years.

				It&#039;s worth noting this guy has AMAZING beef kebabs. They are marinated cubes on steak. The chicken and falafel and great but the other items are super good too.

				I was actually disappointed with Falafel King. I got the Beef Schwarma and it had absolutely no seasoning. It was merely pleasantly cooked meat but it had no discernible flavors. Portions are sizable, but not sure what the point of flavorless schwarma is. Also, I like my falafel made to order. Their Falafel is sitting on a pile waiting to be reheated.<br /><br /><br />I prefer the orange cart/morroccan guy on 31st as you approach starbucks, past Diblasio bench shelter across from the ATM.

				The orange cart&nbsp; (I think it&#039;s called Hossein) is good.&nbsp; Very good.&nbsp; but the last four or five times i ordered falafel, they were out.&nbsp; So now I can just go around the corner.&nbsp; One day, I&#039;d like to do a side by side shawarma or kefta comparison between the two carts.
