				Seems that most places I go sell only low-rise jeans.&nbsp; I can&#39;t wear them for certain reasons, mainly because I find them uncomfortable for my long-waisted torso.&nbsp; High-rise jeans are equally as awful, for different reasons.&nbsp; Mid-rise is where I&#39;d like my jeans, setting about an inch below the belly button.&nbsp; But who sells mid-rise jeans?&nbsp; I am wondering if Levis will fit the bill, but they seem rare here in the east (they are <em>everywhere</em> in the west, their home region!).&nbsp; I know of a place downtown in Manhattan called Canal Jeans, but am concerned that they will only sell low-rise jeans.&nbsp; Anyway, I would welcome suggestions for this seemingly unending frustrating experience of searching for jeans that fit properly.&nbsp; Thanks!

				Meg, I totally feel your pain on this.&nbsp; Gap jeans are the only jeans that fit me even somewhat properly.&nbsp; I am very oddly shaped, and nothing but Gap jeans look decent on me.&nbsp; I have what they call Original Boot Cut and I love them.&nbsp; The waist is definitely about an inch below my belly button (I measured), and there is plenty of room in the tush area (which is essential for me as I seem to have extraneous junk in the trunk).&nbsp; I get ankle length because I have short legs.&nbsp; I admit I wait until they&#39;re having a sale, but they&#39;d be worth regular price if I was desperate.&nbsp; This is just my personal experience.&nbsp; Many might disagree, but I&#39;d give them a shot, just to see, Meg.&nbsp; Good luck!&nbsp; (I hate clothes shopping!)

				I would second the Gap suggestion.&nbsp; They&#39;ve got quite a range of fits - also, if you try them on in the store and find what fits, you can haunt their website until it goes on sale.<br /><br />That said, you really do have to get yourself down to Canal Jeans.&nbsp; It&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve been there, but I would be shocked if they carried only low-rise jeans.

				You know, it has just ocurred to me that women really got the shaft in the clothing department.&nbsp; We have this crazy shape, while men are just straight (for the most part).&nbsp; Unless you&#39;re a stick insect, it&#39;s kind of difficult to find truly flattering clothes.&nbsp; I&#39;m not even talking about sizes, or being overweight or whatever.&nbsp; I really don&#39;t feel clothes are designed to fit women with curves.&nbsp; What&#39;s up with that?&nbsp; Men have it so easy.&nbsp; You buy jeans - any kind - and they fit.&nbsp; Then you buy a nice polo, T-shirt, or button-down, and you&#39;re good.&nbsp; Why do women have to deal with low-rise, ultra-low-rise, ludicrously-low-rise, cropped this and that, stretch, form-fitting . . . . That&#39;s why I love my long, dark blue Gap coat.&nbsp; It hides a multitude of imperfections.&nbsp; Also why I truly hate summer.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-D

				I agree with lanseaux on that one.&nbsp; There&#39;s a difference in styles from say, two years ago, though.&nbsp; Probably just going with the trends, but I haven&#39;t found any I love as much as my old ones.&nbsp; Which brings me to another point, Meg - if you do decide to drop some cash on Gap jeans, they will last you forever!&nbsp; The only thing messed up on mine from ages ago are the bottoms because I always buy them too long and they scrape the ground.&nbsp; THat&#39;s it!&nbsp; They&#39;re in perfect condition everywhere else.&nbsp; Terribly well-made.

				I also have to chime in with a Gap jeans endorsement. I can&#39;t wear low rise jeans, and have a difficult time finding jeans in general. My favorites are the Flares; I get them in &quot;Ankle&quot; instead of &quot;Regular&quot; because my legs are short. I find the cut of Gap jeans more &#39;realistic&#39; than many other chain stores (Express, NYCO, etc) that seem to make jeans for women without hips. Gap is more expensive than what I&#39;d like to spend on a pair of jeans, but a good investment.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now, anyone want to recommend a place to find shorts that aren&#39;t teeny-tiny, but aren&#39;t capri-pants length? I&#39;m too short for capri-pants, and too not-stick-thin for the mini-shorts that seem to be every where.

				I find Old Navy jeans shrink in the length a lot too so I end up with capris after one washing!! I agree with JD- the Old Navy jeans are not cut the same way as Gap jeans are but they are more reasonable priced.<br /><br />I&#39;ve been told that American Eagle jeans fit well and come in all differant styles.

				i can&#39;t say this first hand, but my best friend who also has fit issues says that Lucky jeans are the bestest ever. she stans behind them 100%. they are a bit $$ but she says 2 pair will last forever and they fit great. she keeps trying to get me to get some but alas... i am a little too large. oh well. I tend to stick with old navy because they are cheap and i can toss them after a year or so when my mood changes and they of course fall apart! i play around with clothing alot so its not such a bad thing for me. even doing that, i have to say that i still haven&#39;t found the &quot;perfect&quot; pair.

				H &amp; M prices are ususally super cheap! &nbsp;My favorite H &amp; M is the one on 58th and Lex- it doesn&#39;t seem to be as crowded as the other ones. I tried on a pair of jeans at H &amp; M and they were about $40. <br /><br />Flooz- I have heard that Lucky jeans are good too.

				Wow, I missed out on this whole jean discussion today! I&#39;m very pear-shaped, so I&#39;ve had my problems as well. My $0.02:<br /><br />On Gap - I have a pair of their &quot;curvy&quot; fit jeans and like them a lot. I was never able to wear their jeans before those, and I must admit they fit quite nicely. And price-wise, I don&#39;t think they&#39;re bad at all. Considering everyone I work with wears these $150 - $300 jeans, I consider $60 or so a good price for a good pair of jeans.<br /><br />On Lucky Brand - I have a pair of these. There&#39;s a store at 22nd and Broadway. I found when I tried them on that they weren&#39;t fitting me too great, until I landed on the right cut. They have a lot of different cuts, so you have to experiment. I was kinda mortified spending $100 for jeans, but the sales lady told me they&#39;d be my favorite pair -- and she was right.&nbsp; :-) So that was well-spent I think.<br /><br />On H&amp;M - I have horrible luck with their pants. I stick to skirts and tops there... but maybe they&#39;ve started to make more sizes and cuts. I usually found everything there seemed to be made for a stick-thin model type.<br /><br />Other - My favorite place for pants/jeans is the Limited, but there isn&#39;t one in the city. So anytime I&#39;m near a Limited (home, or in DC), I always hit one up. Also Banana Republic, oddly enough, fit me pretty well. But I always have to get their stuff taken up. I feel like lately, manufactuers have been responding to the concept of women having hips, which I truly appreciate. Or maybe I&#39;m just getting more adventurous with brands (Gap sorta opened the door on that one - that and not living near a Limited anymore)!<br /><br />On handbags - I LONG to drop a decent amount of money on a really really great one, but feel like the trends change so much that it would really need to be a well-thought-out decision. The Dior saddle-bag makes me salivate, but it&#39;s also approximately 1.5 month&#39;s pay, so that&#39;s not going to happen.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I raid Target, or Canal, for my quick-fixes. I love how on Canal now, it&#39;s this whole covert operation where they take you to a hidden room to buy bags. Since they got sued by the expensive bag designers, they can&#39;t sell them in those booths facing the street anymore, so instead you get to feel like you&#39;re breaking the law or something, which I must admit is too fun.&nbsp; :-D<br /><br />And I&#39;ve got no guilt about not giving my money to LVMH or Prada or whoever. Nobody buying these bags is buying them INSTEAD of a real Chanel bag. They&#39;re buying them because they CAN&#39;T AFFORD a real Chanel bag. So they need to get over themselves!

				Ladies, thank you all for your helpful tips and information.&nbsp; I feel so informed!&nbsp; Normally I like shopping alone, but maybe a group jeans buying expedition could be fun.&nbsp; And we could still find our way to Broadway Panhandler or some such place!&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; Or better yet, Chikalicious (dessert restaurant which is super cool).

				I&#39;ve had a lot of luck in places like Daffy&#39;s and Marshall&#39;s. Picked up a bunch of GAP jeans and other good brands for $9.99. Gotta get lucky though, and like most of you, I&#39;m not a good shopper (especially if I can&#39;t just go in, grab what I want and run out ...). But when you can find that kind of a deal it&#39;s sometimes worth the pain of having to scour racks ...

				I hate jeans shopping, it drives me nuts.&nbsp; I will have to try those curvy jeans, of course when I wanted to they didn&#39;t have my size.&nbsp; Which happens all the time, the one pair that might fit me, my size isn&#39;t there.&nbsp; Most shops cater towards this ideal which is just ridiculous for women to meet, and I have no idea why it&#39;s an ideal anyway.&nbsp; Women with any bit of ass and tummy will never look good in these low-rise jeans.&nbsp; And I have no care to see my own love handles hanging out, so why would I want to see someone else&#39;s, especially with the thong all on display as well?&nbsp; The low rises always feel like they&#39;re falling down too!!&nbsp; Yet every store carries them like we&#39;re all one fit.&nbsp; Shopping&#39;s supposed to be fun&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)&nbsp; Someday I&#39;ll start my own store for curvy women, that&#39;ll show them!&nbsp; And I will design swimwear in accurate bra sizes, which is another pet peeve of mine :-D

				Going to the Mermaid parade on the 24th, and in Texas till mid-July. <br /><br />If I miss this trip hopefully we can have another or at least I can get some good tips from y&#39;all on where to shop. T.J. Maxx is my old stand-by and I&#39;ve fallen in love with Daffy&#39;s. I like Burlington Coat Factory but the checkout line always seems so long there. <br /><br />My big problem with pants in general is the length mainly since I don&#39;t wear heels. It seems some pants are meant for women 6&#39;5&quot;. I hate to get great pants for a bargain just to spend more to get them altered.&nbsp; What is a good, low-priced place for alterations? I pass by the ad for **Jack** on Ditmars everyday but have never stopped in to check their prices. <br /><br />

				Just throwing this out there... Back in the day when I had a car, I used to love to take a whole day and go up to Woodbury Common - the gigantic outlet mall upstate - and shop to my heart&#39;s content. It&#39;s not a long drive and they have some great deals, plus it would be so much fun to go with a group (and namely, a group-member who has a car)!<br /><br />Not to deter us from jeans, although I&#39;m sure some could be had up there too, but this might be a fun trip for the girls sometime also...

				Believe it or not, Kmart has been the best place for mid-rise, bootcut, dark jeans for me!!!&nbsp; Who knew???&nbsp; And they are not &quot;Mommie-pants&quot; - they are very much &quot;in&quot;.&nbsp; They are made by Lee and are in the women&#39;s section (not on the wall with the jeans more geared for juniors - although you may also find a pair there).&nbsp; These jeans are very comfortable and have Lycra in them.&nbsp; And, of course, the best part is that they are only about $20!!!

				Saw well-priced non-low rise jeans at NY&amp;Co. this week.&nbsp; They sit &quot;at the waist&quot; and were $39.50 or maybe 2 for $50?&nbsp; Can&#39;t remember the two-fer price exactly right now.&nbsp; I tried them on and they fit perfectly at the waist, but were tooooo long.&nbsp; Dang, I&#39;m tall and I do not need long jeans for non-existent heels.&nbsp; I did try the petite in my size, which, while the right length, did not fit the same at the waist (but petites are small all around, I would imagine).&nbsp; Anyway, NY&amp;Co is worth checking out right now.<br /><br />I saw a tiny, thin woman yesterday wearing low rise jeans and BAM! they hit her right in the fleshy area of the hip. Made her look out of proportion.<br /><br />I think Loki must have been invading the minds of marketers when they came up with the idea of skinny &quot;Audrey&quot; pants.&nbsp; Yuck.
