			<br />Hi All,<br /><br /><br />Need a tutor?&nbsp; I am an experienced teacher, and am looking to tutor students this summer and/or into the upcoming&nbsp; academic year, K-12 in Math, English/ELA and/or Science.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />I also have a very good track record for SHSAT, including tutoring my own two daughters, who are both now at the High School for Math, Science and Engineering. <br /><br /><br />I have a Bachelor&#039;s from the University of Cambridge, and a doctorate.&nbsp; I live locally, and have a flexible schedule and reasonable rates.<br /><br /><br />I can be reached here, via email at dendroanalytic@gmail.com , or by phone or text at 347 306 3603.<br /><br /><br />Have a great day!

			With school just around the corner, my schedule is filling up.&nbsp; If folks want to book tutoring for math, English and science K-12, and especially for the SHSAT test, it would be a good idea to do so soon.&nbsp; SHSAT in particular really benefits from a couple of months of lead-in time. Thank you!
