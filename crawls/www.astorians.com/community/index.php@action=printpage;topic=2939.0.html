				Oy, I&#39;ve lost track of weeks! 10? 11?<br /><br />Anyway, a quick recipe from that CSA cookbook (at least one extra copy still for sale! PM me if you&#39;d like to buy it!) that was quite good this evening...<br /><br />Clean and halve some tomatoes. Clean, quarter lengthwise, and slice some cucumber. You should have about as much tomatoes as cucumber. Put in a bowl. Add some rice wine vinegar (maybe 1-2T per serving?), a pinch of sugar, a pinch of salt, and a little bit of minced cilantro. Let sit for 15 minutes or longer at room temperature. Eat.<br /><br />

				I made stuffed peppers with the sweet peppers we received. I didn&#39;t really follow a recipe and it turned out pretty well.<br /><br />Here&#39;s my concoction:<br /><br />Sweet Bell Peppers, halved lengthwise (or just take the top off)<br />2 cups or so Brown Rice, cooked<br />1 cup or so of vegetable broth<br />About 1/4 cup Vegan Cheese Substitute (recipe found here: http://vegweb.com/index.php?topic=7108.0 - this stuff is fantastic, we make it ALL the time)<br />1/2 large white onion, diced<br />Several fresh basil leaves<br /><br />Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Mix together the last five ingredients and stuff the peppers. Bake in the oven for about 45 minutes. <br /><br />It turned out pretty well. I think next time I might add some mushrooms and maybe some sort of tofu or meat substitute.

				Here&#39;s a recipe for vegan &quot;cheddar cheese&quot; that is also raw. It&#39;s my own invention so, if you want, you can vary the ingredients. Aren&#39;t you glad I gave you my permission?<br /><br />Cashew &quot;Cheese&quot;<br />1 C raw cashews<br />1/3 large orange or red bell pepper<br />Juice of one lemon<br />1/2 medium onion<br />1/2 tsp. sea salt<br />Water<br /><br />Put all ingredients in blender with water just to cover the<br />cashews, and&nbsp; blend together.<br /><br />I just take the cashews out of the bag and throw them <br />in the blender with the rest of the ingredients. <br />You can vary the thickness by using more or less water. <br />It can be used as a sauce on raw &quot;pasta&quot; or &quot;pizza&quot;, or<br />to spread on crackers, or as a dip for corn chips. <br />It&#39;s versatile. <br /><br />BTW, it isn&#39;t the week of August 8th any more but this thread does concern cheeeeese.

				I once came across a vegan feta cheese recipe using tofu and lemon juice (or maybe it was just brine) and a few other things.&nbsp; jerushy, have you ever heard of this?

				No, but I don&#39;t use tofu. It isn&#39;t raw plus I&#39;ve been off soy for several years. I&#39;d like to find a good raw vegan feta recipe that wouldn&#39;t break the bank.&nbsp; :-( The ones I&#39;ve found take a boatload of macadamias and they aren&#39;t cheap.
