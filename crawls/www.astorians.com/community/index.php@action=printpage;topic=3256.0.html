				ewwwwww, gross, I was just walking to the Ditmars Tradefair and on the south sidewalk there is a bunch of garbage and furniture - looks like someone moved out. There are some of those sticky roach/mouse pads and one of them has about 6 of the biggest damn roaches I have ever seen. I&#39;m cringing just thinking about what the contents of the bags look like. They are AT LEAST 3 inches long, (shiver) that is sooooooo disgusting!

				Just a mental picture....that I wish I could get rid of!! I don&#39;t think anyone is going to disturb that mess till the trash gets picked up so they are there for all to see. Lord that is so gross! On second thought, I bet someone tries to go for the sets of plastic drawers, but if they notice the roaches they will probably drop it like a hot potato.

				I could never have gotten close enough to get a good pic on my phone. When I saw them I practically leaped toward the storefronts and started saying out loud, and loudly, GROSS. The two ladies sitting in front of the hardward store nodded in agreement - guess they had seen them too. The only thing that would have made it worse if their (roaches) antennaes had been moving.

				Well, those might be the same type of roaches that invaded our apartment a couple of weeks ago after the Con Ed digging on our block.&nbsp; A week later, there was more digging on our block, and I caught one of the suckers walking up the outside of our building when I came home that night -- needless to say, it didn&#39;t get any further.&nbsp; If they are the same kind, they don&#39;t generally nest in apartments, so the furniture might be ok.&nbsp; (Not that I&#39;d test it out....)

				We got our first giant roach this morning.&nbsp; Right in the middle of the hallway, flat on its back.&nbsp; When I went to put a paper towel over it pre-crushing it, it moved a little bit, so I guess it wasn&#39;t completely dead.&nbsp; Big and disgusting.&nbsp; All the roaches I&#39;d ever seen before were black, but this one was brown.&nbsp; Not a really, really dark brown either.&nbsp; Weird.<br /><br />I hope that was the only one we&#39;ll get.

				We never had them, maybe 1x/year. And those were the ones my cat had conveniently caught/killed during the night. Then the blackout and the ConEd debacle. Right when my new roommate moved in. Then it was one after another all over the place.&nbsp; :-o Even my cat couldn&#039;t keep up.<br /><br />Mixed up a batch of Heloise&#039;s Roach Dough (flour, water, sugar, oil, boric acid) and put out some little balls of that. Seemed to help.<br /><br />Then a couple of weeks ago, went into the bathroom, and saw a couple of antennas behind the bathroom scale. Called in the cat, but she seemed amused. The damn giant thing (brown and massive, like that photo) ran under the bathmat, so I squashed it through the mat and flushed its carcass back to whence it came. <span style="font-family: Verdana;" class="bbc_font"><em>Gaahhh!!!!! </em> </span>

				I think it works for any bug that likes dough&nbsp; :evil: Here&#039;s the recipe:<br /><br />Roach Cookies<br /><br />1/4 cup shortening<br />1/8 cup sugar<br />8 oz. boric acid<br />1/2 cup flour<br />water to moisten<br /><br />Rather than risk contaminating any kitchen utensils, I put all the ingredients into a sandwich bag and mush it all together. Then roll into little balls and put them in the corners where pets won&#039;t reach. You can make the balls by pinching off dough in the bag and rolling them through that way. I take pieces of used bike tire tube and scoop small wads, secure tube w/rubber band lengthwise and voila- ghetto roach traps!

				If you are referring to what they call &quot;waterbugs,&quot; they freak the hell out of me! when I first moved to my apartment they were a pretty big problem- but thankfully, I hadn&#039;t seen one in years- until a few weeks ago when I found one dead in the bathtub one morning! Now I have to brace myself everytime I pull back the shower curtain. : (<br /><br />Of course I&#039;d rather not see them at all, but the worst part is not killing them- it&#039;s picking them up and throwing them out once they are dead. BTW, I remember reading somewhere that the brown ones are actually females. Yikes!<br />

				What is the difference between a waterbug and a cockroach?<br /><br />There is no difference.<br /><br />This roach is also known as a &quot;waterbug&quot; or &quot;palmetto bug&quot;.<br /><br />AMERICAN COCKROACH APPEARANCE:<br /><br /><br />Reddish-brown, about 1.5 inches long or longer, winged, but seldom fly.<br /><br /><br />AMERICAN COCKROACH DIET:<br /><br /><br />They prefer decaying organic matter, but being scavengers will eat anything. Sweets are attractive to them. The American cockroach will also feed on starchy items like book bindings, and the back of wall paper.<br /><br />AMERICAN COCKROACH HABITS AND BIOLOGY:<br /><br /><br />American cockroach females produce many egg capsules, having 14-16 eggs hatching in 50-55 days into grayish-brown &quot;nymphs&quot;. As they mature they become more reddish-brown in appearance. Adults and nymphs can be found in a variety of places. In the North,they are commonly found in steam heat tunnels or in large institutional buildings. American cockroaches more commonly congregate in open spaces instead of small crack and crevices. When indoors,they can be located in dark, moist areas like basements and crawl spaces. Other likely areas indoors would be around bathtubs, floor drains,and sewers. Outside the American cockroach can be found in moist, shady areas like: yards, hollow trees, woodpiles,and mulch. At times the American cockroach can be found under roof shingles or attics. Usually they will live outside, but will wander inside in search for food and water or during extremes in weather conditions.<br /><br />AMERICAN COCKROACH RECOMMENDED PRODUCTS AND TREATMENT:<br /><br /><br />Caulk all penetrations through ground level walls.<br />Stop water leaks, screen equipment overflow drains, and take overflow water away from buildings; keep drain traps full or capped.<br />Remove rotting leaves from window wells.<br />Move garbage cans out of preferred moist habitat.<br />Ventilate moist spaces.<br />Generally speaking, American cockroach control measures should concentrate on the outside of the building and points of entry. This is called a &quot;perimeter or barrier&quot; treatment.

				Just be sure to replace the &quot;cookies&quot; every now and then as they dry out. Don&#039;t be afraid to use up the batch you made. And keep out of reach of pets. I placed dough along the back edge of the kitchen counter (behind the microwave), under the sink way in the back, in the bathroom between the sink and the tub. Yeah you can sprinkle boric acid around, too, but that makes me nervous as it&#039;s so loose. Best for the truly out-of-reach places (we have cats.)<br /><br />Heloise developed the recipe while in Hawaii where there are superdupersized roaches, so she ain&#039;t effin around&nbsp; :evil:

				The Roach Cookie recipe sounds pretty good..............if I added raisins, couldn&#039;t I eat it myself. Then just step on the roach?

				<br /><br /><strong>Ode to NYC Wildlife!</strong><br /><br />I bought a bottle of boric @ Pathmark that has this wonderful applicator top (similar to a commercial condiment bottle). I squeezed a bunch into cracks and holes (like under the sink where the pipe meets the wall) and then covered over it with caulk. Seems to do the trick. And if any sneak through, I have a 24hr kitty patrol! :-)
