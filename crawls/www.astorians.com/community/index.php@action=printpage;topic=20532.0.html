				I have lived in NYC for over 4 years now, and managed to live in 4 different places. I have used brokers to help me apartment hunt, and signed leases with 3 different brokers over the years. I&#039;d say I&#039;ve worked with (on some level) at least 20 different brokers through the years... but I can say confidently that I found the BEST broker NYC, specifically Astoria, Queens - has to offer!<br /><br />His name is Anastasios &quot;Taso&quot; Makedon and he&#039;s the best broker you&#039;re going to find. He runs a team of fantastic people over at Astoria Apartments, located at 21-70 31st Street. Contact him at taso@astoriaapartmentsllc.com and tell him Kelly and Arthur sent you. <br /><br />To further convince anyone who reads this, here&#039;s our story:<br /><br />My boyfriend Arthur and I were looking for a 2 BR apartment by Feb. 1st. We had already been looking a week when we ran into Taso by chance - all because of a Craigslist ad. The ad mentioned that texts were fine for communication, which I immediately sent. Taso not only responded back within minutes, but he had an appointment set up for us the next day! We really loved the place, and almost went through with it - doing the credit check and everything. However, in the end, we found what we felt to be a better deal and we gave him our regrets and turned it down. Now, anyone who&#039;s dealt with brokers before, knows that chances are good that you&#039;re not going to be treated kindly when you suddenly back out of what seemed like a sure deal for the broker. Here&#039;s where Taso showed me why he&#039;s the best:<br /><br />I call, after we&#039;ve left his office, paid the credit check fee, said we&#039;d take the apartment and are simply waiting for the owner to agree, and say: &quot;Taso, I&#039;m so sorry, but we&#039;ve found something else that seems to be a better deal and we&#039;ve decided to take it. I&#039;m so, so sorry.&quot;<br /><br />His response: &quot;Well, congratulations! Listen, I&#039;m sorry it didn&#039;t work out with this place I found for you - but I&#039;ll tell this owner that he missed his chance to have two great tenants. I wish you the best. And if you have any friends looking for a place to live, I&#039;d really appreciate it if you&#039;d pass my name along.&quot; <br /><br />I could believe it. Not only was I not treated rudely - I was congratulated! He followed up with correspondence that night to say that if, by chance, our place didn&#039;t work out - to please contact him again. He said we were, and I quote &quot;Five-Star Clients&quot; and he would put us at the top of his list. <br /><br />Well, as NYC life would have it - our other place did in fact fall through. So we contacted Taso again - and he went straight to work setting up appointments for us in our price range. (Which, I might add - was not very high) The day we went out to visit, we walked into the first apartment, and we knew it was our next home. Taso knew exactly what we wanted and made sure we found it. He was never pushy, never rude, and was completely honest with us about the neighborhood, the landlord, the apartment, the lease we&#039;d be signing, and the decision we had to make. I cannot recommend him enough!!!!<br /><br />So - if you&#039;re looking for a new apartment in Astoria - or have friends that are... look up Taso at Astoria Apartments. You won&#039;t regret it!<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Kelly<br />A new Astorian :)<br /><br />
