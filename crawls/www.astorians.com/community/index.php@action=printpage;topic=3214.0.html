				When you go back to film.. what type of film are you going to use? My favorite is probably Ilford FP4+. I actually recently bought some outdated bw400cn at Duane Reade for 1.67! and it was really nice. <br /><br />Are you going to scan you&#39;re negs? If so, what are you going to use?&nbsp;

				I&#39;ll probably scan the negs for web-ues w/ my mediocre-at-best Canoscan that has a transparency adapter.<br /><br />As for film - I just bought a couple of rolls of Fuji Pro 160C as well as Kodak 160VC to see how the difference in saturation plays out.&nbsp; As for B&amp;W, depends on what I&#39;m going for.&nbsp; Ilford has some nice, smooth, full toned films these days&nbsp; - probably the FP4 that you mention.&nbsp; I&#39;ve always been a fan of Kodak&#39;s T-Max films as well since I&#39;m more comfortable developing them myself....not that I do that these days - but I still have some of my equipment - including an enlarger for 35mm.&nbsp; Sold off the pair of Omega D&#39;s as well as a bunch of other things.&nbsp; <br /><br />I still have my Schneider lenses though.&nbsp; &nbsp;They aren&#39;t going anywhere.
