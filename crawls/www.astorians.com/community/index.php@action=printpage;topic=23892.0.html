				&nbsp; <strong><span style="font-family: impact;" class="bbc_font">Secret Theatre Musicals</span></strong> is pleased to announce their production of <em>URINETOWN: THE MUSICAL</em>. With a book and lyrics by Greg Kotis and music and lyrics by Mark Hollman, this exciting production is directed by Taryn Turney and will play a 3-week limited engagement. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Winner of three Tony awards and one of the most uproariously funny musicals in recent years, <em>URINETOWN</em> is a hilarious tale of greed, love, and revolution in a time when water is worth its weight in gold. In a Gotham-like city, a terrible water shortage, caused by a 20-year drought, has led to a government-enforced ban on private toilets. The citizens must use public amenities, regulated by a single malevolent company that profits by charging admission for one of humanity&#039;s most basic needs. :shocked: Amidst the people, a hero decides he&#039;s had enough, and plans a revolution to lead them all to freedom! :cheesy: Inspired by the works of Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill, <em>URINETOWN</em> is an irreverently humorous satire in which no one is safe from scrutiny. Praised for reinvigorating the very notion of what a musical could be, <em>URINETOWN</em> catapults the “comedic romp” into the new millennium with its outrageous perspective, wickedly modern wit, and sustained ability to produce gales of unbridled laughter.&nbsp; :laugh: <br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: arial;" class="bbc_font">SPECIAL!!!
