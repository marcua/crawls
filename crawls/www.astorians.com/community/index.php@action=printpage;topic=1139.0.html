				I know many people who use rice cookers and they swear by them. &nbsp;I've see white and sushi rice cooked in them, and the rice comes out perfectly, especially when it comes to sushi rice. &nbsp;Don't know about brown rice, but that is done easy enough on the stove. &nbsp;Though, I can't believe a rice cooker would not cook brown rice well. &nbsp;To many it is not an extraneous appliance. &nbsp;And there is almost no thought when it comes to these machines - just dump it all in and turn it on and walk away til done. If you are cooking rice 3-4 times a week, it's totally worth it. &nbsp;Once a week....meh? &nbsp;I don't think they are too expensive either.

				Well I cook almost no rice now because it's such a PITA. &nbsp;But I would like to cook rice regularly. &nbsp;And I would like the rice portion of my meal to be the accompaniment rather than the embarassment.<br /><br />Vargh!<br /><br />I think it might also be a pot problem (no, not that I'm smoking too much) but that I only have uh... like 2. &nbsp;To occupy one of them wih the rice (usually the smaller of the 2) sort of limits my options.

Brown rice can be kind of tricky. I usually have to put in 2x the amount of water that's required. 1 cup of rice with 3+ cups of water. It also helps to add a drop of light oil to prevent the rice from sticking/burning to the bottom. I think next time I'll coat the rice in a little bit of oil first, then add the water.<br /><br />Question: will adding salt to the water aid in cooking the rice faster?

				rice cookers are brilliant. You can make lots of stuff in them. Grains n' things. And often they some with a little steaming plate and you can steam veggies and what not in them. They're are bargain - so cheap and so functional. I'll never do stove-top rice again.

				If you have a rice cooker you don&#39;t even need to measure the ingredients. You just pour however much rice you want into the cooker, then you put in water to cover the rice 1 inch. So the water line is one inch above your rice.<br /><br />To make sushi rice you just add a little sugar and rice wine vinegar when it&#39;s done and still hot and you stir it a lot. The rice will become sticky since you are helping it cool off fast.<br /><br />That&#39;s all there is to it. Brown rice, white rice, doesn&#39;t matter. One inch is all you need and hit start.

				Try doing a basmati or long grain white rice pilaf in the cooker and you&#39;ll love the results.&nbsp; <br /><br />1/2 stick salted butter<br />1 tablespoon broken angel hair/spaghetti pasta or orzo<br />1 cup rice<br />1 can chicken broth<br />salt &amp; pepper to taste <br /><br />push that button &amp; enjoy! <br /><br />(serves 2-3, but can easily be doubled or tripled for a larger crowd) :-D

				the recipe merm mentions goes for cooking white rice or basmati rice in a pot too.<br /><br />the trick is to put in the rice first, cover it with about 1 inch of rice (or put your index finger in the pot just touching top of rice, water should come up to the second joint of your finger.)&nbsp; <br />Just so you know, 2/1 water to rice is usually too much liquid.<br /><br />So,&nbsp; <br />saute any herbs, aromatics, veggies, oil/butter.&nbsp; <br />mix in rice, pour in water using trick above. <br />bring to boil uncovered.&nbsp; <br />lower to simmer, cover and cook 10-15 minutes.<br />should be fluffy when stirred at this point.<br /><br />A rice cooker rocks by the way.&nbsp; great thing to have in the kitchen and a no brainer to boot.
