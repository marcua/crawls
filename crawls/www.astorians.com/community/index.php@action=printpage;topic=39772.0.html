				<br />Greed.&nbsp; That&#039;s what it all boils down to.&nbsp; It is positively stupefying...the pace of gentrification now in Astoria.&nbsp; I just shake my head...every time I turn around, more construction sites...sometimes multiple new buildings going up on just one block alone!<br /><br />This wouldn&#039;t be happening without our politicians allowing it to happen.&nbsp; <br /><br />Today I was walking down 30th Ave near 35th Street, and I saw an entire string of businesses GONE.&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty sure it was the block that used to have what I thought was a great, divey old-school billiards place (down the stairs, and I think run by Colombians?).... and right next to it was a charming old-school music store that sold guitars and also offered private lessons.&nbsp; (I had always hoped to one day get some bouzouki lessons there!)&nbsp; And now...unless I missed them and they were on another block?....I think they are both gone.&nbsp; And what did I see but a new sign...something about some &#039;mixed-use building&#039; going up, which is just a typical total b.s. way to get around restrictions, get tax write-offs etc.<br /><br />Honestly, it makes me almost physically ill, because I know that at the core of this is pure greed.&nbsp; Why oh why do so many people crave $$$ so much, at any cost, and not caring about the negative effects...driving out old-school businesses, long-term residents, and completely altering the character of the neighborhood?&nbsp; Money will NOT make you happier!

				I&#039;m sure it&#039;s nothing personal, just business.<br /><br /><br />If you owned a piece of property and costs (most notably real estate taxes) rise faster than the income from the long time commercial tenants - what would you do?&nbsp; You either raise rents or re-develop.&nbsp; Many of these owners are long time owners who own one or two buildings and have suffered through some rough times in the neighborhood. In that case your number one goal is to take care of YOUR family, not to subsidize your commercial tenants.<br />The government could step in and reduce the tax burden on properties that charge below market commercial rents but that is never going to happen.<br /><br /><br />Perhaps Yippee1999 should buy up some real estate and charge rents that barely cover expenses as a community service.

				Do you have any data to show that indeed, commercial R.E. taxes have increased to such a degree, that the bldg. owners were forced to raise their rents by such a degree, or else sell to a developer, in order to survive?<br /><br />Because I know at least in the case of private R.E. in Astoria, the taxes have NOT gone up that much...certainly not to warrant the greedy apartment rent increases.&nbsp; Are you saying that commercial R.E. taxes are calculated differently?<br /><br />Increased taxes also doesn&#039;t explain why development of large apartment buildings is allowed go on, unfettered.&nbsp; The writing is on the wall....Astoria is going to be too densely populated along Bway/31st, 30th Ave/31st, and possibly Ditmars/31st.&nbsp; N/W trains are already too crowded.&nbsp; The Hallets Point ferry, while nice for those who live way over by it, will do nothing to significantly help with the overcrowding on the N/W.&nbsp; We can already see more traffic, more cars impatiently swerving around others, etc.&nbsp; This does not bode well for a neighborhood like Astoria.&nbsp; This is not Manhattan.

				Real estate taxes on residential properties, especially under 6 units is limited by law to a very low per year increase.&nbsp; If the house is owned and occupied by a verteran there is virtually no increase at all in real estate taxes.<br /><br /><br />Taxes on commercial real estate is not limited, and I do have personal experience having real estate taxes double and having to hire attorneys every year to fight the city to keep the&nbsp; increases to a number that is not seemingly arbitrarily picked out of a hat.&nbsp; Do a quick google search and you&#039;ll see that there is an entire industry of attorneys that only handle commercial real estate tax protests.<br /><br /><br />Manhattan has nowhere to grow other than UP or OUT. As far as UP goes, there are plenty of supertall buildings being built in Manhattan.&nbsp; Astoria is just becoming an extension for Manhattan just as Williamsburg, Greenpoint, Park Slope, Bushwick, Brooklyn Height and LIC have become.&nbsp; NYC is growing and the days of Astoria as one of NYS&#039;s quiet secret gems is over.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				<br />Efharisto, broadwaybb!&nbsp; Glad to know they are still in biz.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure the rent on 28th Ave is much cheaper that what they were paying on 30th Ave, plus 28th Ave is closer to me.&nbsp; So win for me all around! ;-)

				Really - if you were born here you&#039;re almost certainly thought of as some Archie Bunker holdover as all the blond yuppies move in.&nbsp; And forget about buying a house in Astoria . . .parts of the UWS are less expensive than Astoria, apartment wise anyway.<br /><br /><br />And I agree - the ferry - what a joke.&nbsp; I guess if you have an hour to get to it, it&#039;s a &quot;quick&quot; way to get to Manhattan.

				Hey Astoria Girl, I was being sarcastic, not quite a Archie Bunker holdover, my roots are in Woodside, but moved back to the neighborhood after living out West for 5 years...man the house prices here are ridiculous...if the zoning ever gets changed, the landlords are going to cash in, the buildings are going to get torn down, and Astoria is going to resemble what Long Island City looks like now...and none of us (old neighborhood folks) are going to be able to afford to live here. I can&#039;t retire yet.. so I don&#039;t know where the hell I will go
