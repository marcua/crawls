				It&#039;s really irritating to drive on. <br />Semi-related story: <br /><br />My car was legally parked on Ditmars and 27th last week. I come by that Thursday, and it&#039;s gone. I see a bunch of paper signs indicating that the cars there were re-located for road construction- OK, usually no big deal. I walk around a few blocks to see if they moved it closeby, but see nothing. I call the 114th precinct, and after 45 minutes of trying to get through, I finally get to speak to a real, live person! I give them the license plate number and after 20 minutes on hold, the person at the precinct tells me there is no record of my car being moved. I ask her what to do, and she tells me to call 911 and report it stolen. Finally, I get frustrated, and hang up. I think to myself that it is entirely too coincidental for my car to disappear, and assume some idiot has screwed up the log book. <br />A friend was kind enough to come by, drive me around and, ten blocks away- there it is. My car, with a note on the windshield from the DOT stating that the car was moved for road construction.<br /><br />One more point for the 114th- thanks again for nothing, you idiots.&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				Remember folks its budget time.. if the dot does not burn up the excess $$ they have left over from the year they lose it when it comes to the next years budget.. but if they burn it up.. they can go ahead and say oh we need more $$$&nbsp; we ran out...&nbsp; &nbsp;just my&nbsp; .02 theory...<br /><br />Far as the car being towed and the 114 not knowing about it.. .it is the Tow Truck driver&#039;s responsibility to log every tow in the precient tow book... if they don&#039;t log it the precient does not even know that the car&#039;s been towed.

				They had put the signs up in advance so if the car was towed I don&#039;t know why you didnt&#039; see the sign when you parked there and they probably haven&#039;t been able to finish the work because of the rain,

As per alternate side, I didn&#039;t even have to move it until the following Monday, so I was in good shape, or so I thought. I heard from neighbors that signs did not go up until the day before they started towing cars, which I believe was Thursday. <br /><br />As far as the 114th, 311 directed me to them in order to find the whereabouts of the car. The fact that it took me that long to get through to a person, and then they give me a completely incorrect answer pisses me off. When I spoke to the person at the 114th, she said they had a log book of cars that were moved, and according to 311 and the person who (eventually) answered the phone at the 114th, that is the correct place to be calling if your car has been moved for construction.

				So I go around the corner to the former Kafene to get a cup of coffee and I see the tow trucks in action.&nbsp; &nbsp;Seems they&#039;re scraping and paving Hoyt South.&nbsp; &nbsp;People are out screaming bloody murder because, according to the coffee guy that opens at 6:00, they only placed the NO PARKING signs at 6:30 this morning.<br /><br />So don&#039;t feel bad that you didn&#039;t see any signs.<br /><br />BTW, this is the same Hoyt Ave South that they just repainted the lines on for traffic and bike lanes.&nbsp; &nbsp;:mrgreen:

What is even worse is on Queens Blvd around 69th St, on both the eastbound<br />and westbound lanes, they have yet to repave the roads and there is a dip on the eastbound side(they put up orange<br />cones to let you know) where you have to almost come to a complete stop otherwise your front end will be bouncing<br />up and down like a basketball.

				They are repaving the road on 19th Street by the park right now, so they&#039;re definitely out there, but I imagine it does take time and they probably couldn&#039;t do too much with all the rain the past four days.&nbsp; Still, that does suck about the cars and not much surprised me about the way things are handled.
