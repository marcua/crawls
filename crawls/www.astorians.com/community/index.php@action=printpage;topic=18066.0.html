				Actually you are just paying for your meal. The presentation is information on how the economy is and how you can change your life? Presented by someone who has the experience. It&#039;s pretty amazing a company that in less than five years is making over 65 M a year with a product that is backed by science. Certified by an external Lab. We also have many testimonials on our products. You want to find out more? Search on google Dystonia with Xocai.&nbsp;

				Sorry, I don&#039;t buy that the presenters aren&#039;t getting a cut of the $50 pp fee.&nbsp; a $50 weekday lunch in LIC had better be a very nice.<br /><br />I found this interesting review of the business:<br /><br />http://www.businessopportunitywatch.com/BOW%20Review%20of%20XOCAI%20Make%20Chocolate%20Your%20Business.htm

				Yeah, a $50 lunch sounds pretty damn expensive for Astoria.&nbsp; I work near Wall Street and go out to business lunches that are cheaper than $50.&nbsp; <br /><br />Weird.&nbsp;
