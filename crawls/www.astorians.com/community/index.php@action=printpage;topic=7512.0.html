				Hey guys, just a heads up for anyone with a car who parks on 20th Road (that little curved road the runs from 31-46 St between 20th &amp; 21st Aves) - part of it is now a one-way street! They just did this today, according to one of my neighbors, so if you&#039;re reading this at work, you&#039;re probably fine, I can&#039;t imagine they&#039;d give tickets for being parked in the wrong direction immediately after they put up the signs and painted the lines.<br /><br />I&#039;m parked just east of Steinway, and I had to turn my car around to make sure it was pointing in the right direction. I could see that it is one way through at least 42nd St, but it&#039;s still two way (from what I could see) west of Steinway. Not sure how far it extends in either direction.<br /><br />Either way, if you&#039;re parked anywhere on 20th Road, go check on it and make sure you&#039;re pointed in the right direction, or else you might get a ticket tomorrow morning!<br /><br />Also, alt side parking is suspended tomorrow (http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/motorist/scrintro.html), so if you&#039;re on the Wednesday side (wherever you are), you&#039;re fine for tomorrow!

I know where I am, there is a stretch (mostly east of 41 St) where it is really narrow and sometimes hard for just 1 car to fit through with cars parallel parked on both sides, so maybe that has something to do with it. I always managed, but it would sometimes involve pulling over to let the other guy through, or backing up to let a delivery truck through, etc.

				Hey PJ, I live not too far from you. Remember when 20th Road was really more like a &quot;country road&quot; and cars would rarely go by? Now in the mornings I have to wait for cars to pass before I could cross!

				<br /><br />i know that is true, we get alot of traffic every day, hopefully this one way will cut down on the accidents over there, i seen / hear plenty, anyway people use 20rd to cut out the 20 ave traffic in the mornings, <br /><br />
