				Wondering if any of you have removed your A/C units from your windows yet?&nbsp; We took our window fan out today, not yet ready for A/C removal (a bigger job).&nbsp; Do you think the weather will continue along this cooler path or will a surprise heat wave show up out of nowhere?&nbsp; I must admit, after this scorching summer, I am really enjoying the cooler fall weather.&nbsp; Hope it continues like this.

				Record high in NYC in October is 85 (back in the 50s). I think we&#039;re good, especially since the forecast for this week is normal. Even if we do have the freak 85 degree day, it will cool down for night :)<br /><br />http://weather.yahoo.com/climo/USNY0996_f.html?woeid=2459115 (http://weather.yahoo.com/climo/USNY0996_f.html?woeid=2459115)<br /><br />Haven&#039;t taken my AC out yet, but I look forward to reclaiming that window this weekend!

				I&#039;ve just had the window above it left in the open position, and last night it was super chilly (but this was countered with the comforter). Forecast says it will hover around 70 daytime next two days, so I&#039;ll take the opportunity to move it out by the weekend.

				Usually leave ours in until I know it will absolutely not be needed. Seen too many October days that catch everyone out. We live on the top floor so it doesn&#039;t have to be particularly hot for the apt. to get uncomfortable. If the sun is out all day on a 75 degree day, the place can get very warm. I&#039;ll put it on for a few hours to cool the place down until it gets cooler outside and we can leave the bedroom window open. I&#039;ll also use it if it&#039;s particularly humid if not really warm. Helps to keep the dampness down which is more uncomfortable sometimes.<br /><br />

				Can I ask you guys where you actually put your ACs&nbsp; when they&#039;re not in the window?&nbsp; I mean, it&#039;s not like I have a basement to store it and my apt is so cluttered.&nbsp; And the AC is just darn dirty and big to have just lying anywhere.&nbsp; What do you guys do with yours?

				Once it DOES come out (still in), it gets stored under a plush towel on the Radiator Cover. It becomes a nice bed for the cats. At Christmas time it becomes the Nativity spot.

				I&#039;m lucky to have closet space to store it.<br /><br />Daisy - can you store it on your balcony? Maybe triple-trash-bag it to protect it from any snow? (Make sure it&#039;s super dried out first.) I know when I leave mine in the window, it&#039;s like I have an open window, since air seems to just flow right through it.

Not tonight, unfortunately, because our AC is out the window, sitting in the corner of the room and covered with a towel.

				We&#039;re on the top floor, with a black roof. So it doesn&#039;t take much to warm it up in there. Like I said, only a couple of hours until it cools off a bit. Since we will be having our place painted soon and they need to repair the area around the window, it will be probably be out in 2 weeks or so.<br /><br />After suffering in there the few years before I got one (temp in the kitchen would easily get to 110+ on the hottest days), I think I&#039;m entitled to be as comfortable as possible and to not take the weather for granted!&nbsp; :-D

				Black roof-no good. I understand what you&#039;re saying. Our roof is silver and it still gets too hot inside. We&#039;re on the second floor (top) and it gets mighty hot in the summer, especially in the kitchen area. Just boiling a couple of eggs would heat up the apartment bad, not to mention the refrigerator&#039;s motor constantly kicking on. Hopefully once the outside temperature drops it&#039;ll only take a day or two to cool off your apartment.

				If you&#039;re going to leave it outside, you could get a wide roll of shrink wrap plastic from Staples or a moving store, and wrap the unit super tight with multiple layers. Wrap enough layers of that stuff around it and it will be water proof. You could then get a bbq grill cover (or something else) and put that over the wrapped unit. My grill cover is thick canvas on the inside and waterproof rubber on the outside, which gives it a sort of padded effect. That could help further protect the unit from potential debris damage. Good luck!

				I haven&#039;t taken my two AC units (one bedroom and one living room) out since I first installed them 5 years ago.&nbsp; I had such a horrendous experience with putting them in that the thought of doing it again is something I only want to deal with if I move.&nbsp; My girlfriend paid a PC Richard installer a little extra to put in her second unit (she bought one and had one from her old place) because I had all sorts of issues with it.
