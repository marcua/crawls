				Just curious if there are any other NY Liberty (WNBA) fans here in Astoria. My hubby &amp; I have season tix &amp; are always looking for folks to talk gossip &amp; watch the away games with without having to go to a SportsBar in Manhattan somewheres. Anyhow...

				I am a HUGE WNBA and NY Liberty fan! We don&#039;t get season tix because our work schedules are so unpredictable (we&#039;re both prone to being stuck at work late), but we go to the weekend games and try to make it to as many weeknight games as possible.<br /><br />As for the post Becky Hammon era... I think it&#039;s a good thing. Carol Blazejowski has been promising fans a younger, faster team and she&#039;s finally beginning to deliver. Now, if she could only find a decent coach...

				Hi, I&#039;m a fan too - went to the verrry first game in MSG all those years ago and am still hooked. Played ball all through high school and I was overjoyed when the WNBA was formed. I don&#039;t get season tickets b/c of my work/summer vacation schedule but usually get the 6 pack, my seats are in Section 225. Can&#039;t wait for the new season to start and I hope the team can really start to gel this year, gonna be interesting to see how things go without lil&#039; Becky...I will miss her and her amazing 3-pointers. - Bibi

				It WAS rather mysterious that we started winning as soon as Becky went out with the ankle injury...and couldn&#039;t agree more about Coach Coyle. It&#039;s almost like her plan is, &quot;Hey, that player is in flow &amp; doing great, let&#039;s sit them down.&quot;

And it&#039;s good to see that they&#039;re finally making an effort to replace the bigs on the inside with players who aren&#039;t afraid to get bumped around. Ann Wauters was a big disappointment -- too fragile. Great acquisition, but she never played a full season in a Liberty uniform! With J-Mac, Davenport and Tiff Jackson, we&#039;ve got size inside -- when one of your best rebounders is your 5&#039;9&quot; point guard (Loree Moore) you know it&#039;s time to draft or trade for an inside game.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=5971.msg68841.html#msg68841">Quote from: notoriousliz on April 16, 2007, 11:21:57 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It WAS rather mysterious that we started winning as soon as Becky went out with the ankle injury...and couldn&#039;t agree more about Coach Coyle.

How she&#039;s kept her job is beyond me... obviously she&#039;s either got friends in high places or the Dolan family just couldn&#039;t care less about the Liberty -- any other coach with such an abysmal record would have been shown the door by now.

				My ex-gf had season tickets &amp; I went to a ton of games with her, but that was in 2003.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t been since, but I&#039;d be interested in following them again.<br /><br />http://www.wnba.com/liberty/schedule/
