				Hey guys--<br /><br />One of my friend&#039;s buildings burned down this past weekend. She&#039;s lost absolutely everything she had and is now staying in temporary housing.<br /><br />She and her two roommates are trying to find housing and they&#039;ve visited me in Astoria enough to know that they would like the area. <br /><br />I know when I needed a place, reaching out on Astorians is what got me a new home, so while they&#039;re looking on Craigslist, I thought I would post here, just to see if anyone had any knowledge of three bedrooms in the area. Upper Ditmars would be too far--they would need to be near the subway without having to take a bus. <br /><br />Also, their landlord was pretty sketchy and they had a previous issue with the brokers that led to them getting their fee back. If anyone has been through this and has advice beyond what&#039;s on the NYC Tenant sites, please feel free to share so that I can pass the info along.
