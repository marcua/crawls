			There are many places online, and some in the city, but Im looking for a place in Astoria that sells stuff like loose tea, essential oils, loose herbs, etc.! If anyone knows of any stores like that in Astoria please let me know.

			There's a place on Crescent just north of 30th Ave. &nbsp;Badal Roy's, I think. &nbsp;I know that he has some essential oils - but probably no loose tea. &nbsp;<br /><br />For loose tea I go to the Tea and Sympathy in Chelsea, but the selection is not terribly vast - just the typical orange pekoe/oolongs, Earl Grey, Darjeeling and a few fruit teas. &nbsp;(But they do have Eddie Izzard videos and Branston's pickle!) &nbsp;If you find something here in Astoria please post - I would love to know about it.

			I would say try some of the natural food stores. Broadway Natural may carry some of what you are looking for. They are on Broadway just off of 31st next to the subway. There is also a natural food store that is closer to Steinway and 30th Ave. or Broadway. I forget the name of it though.<br /><br />Also GNC stores may have essential oils, however I am not sure. Of course if you are against chains then that is obviously a place you'll avoid.<br /><br />Loose herbs - grocery stores, and little hole in the wall fruit and vegetable stores.<br /><br />Unfortunately I can't think of any place that sells all three in one place. Maybe someone else knows of a place?

			Thanks I will have to check them out. My favorite place to go online is http://www.mountainroseherbs.com/ . They have certified organic &nbsp;loose teas, certified organic bulk spices, herbs and bontanicles and 100% undiluted therapeutic quality oils essential oils, plus other stuff. I was trying to find a place like this around in Astoria because sometimes its hard to wait for a package to come and you just want to get out of the house and go shop. &nbsp; :P
