				So how do you decide where to eat good Greek food when there are so many to choose from? Anyone have any suggestions for a good place to eat at on Sunday? It would be nice if they had outdoor seating too. <br /><br />thanks<br />liz<br />

				I am by no means an expert on Greek cuisine, but I really like Aliada (spelling?) and Uncle George&#039;s.&nbsp; I have attached a recent discussion regarding a couple of specific Greek restuarants for you to look at.&nbsp; I believe Opa&#039;s (sorry about the spelling) has backyard garden, which, as I recall was essentially a hanging garden.<br /><br />http://www.astorians.com/index.php?topic=7220.0

				I would say that the best place by far, with an outdoor sitting area is Agnandi, corner of Ditmars and 19th Street.&nbsp; You can&#039;t go wrong there, but eating early is better than late because it gets very crowded!

				Zenon is great - their mixed app dip platter thing is super super fresh and I&#039;ve always enjoyed my meals there.<br /><br />Uncle George&#039;s - while I love their lamb - is REALLY low on atmosphere and their attitude makes it difficult to choke down their inconsistent chow.

				Ovelia is a great place for Greek food. Agnanti is delicious but a bit expensive and the service can be dodgy if you&#039;re not a traditional Greek. Ovelia&#039;s food is awesome, trendy hangout, younger crowd and family friendly. Service is always wonderful. I&#039;ve tried practically the whole menu and loved everything I&#039;ve had in the past.

				Here is the website for Agnanti (http://www.agnantimeze.com/), with menu and prices.<br /><br />Ovelia&#039;s website (http://www.ovelia-ny.com/) isn&#039;t complete yet (no menu), but this article (http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=17727486&amp;BRD=2731&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=574952&amp;rfi=6) gives an idea of some of their prices.<br /><br />I&#039;d vote for Agnanti over Ovelia, myself.&nbsp; I really enjoy the meze at Agnanti - I think there is more variety in what they offer.&nbsp; I&#039;m not Greek and I&#039;ve never had an issue with service at Agnanti, but I&#039;ve also tried to go when it&#039;s not packed - I agree that it&#039;s better to go earlier.

				Thanks!&nbsp; The Agnandi site only had prices for catering, but in comparison with the article you mentioned, they look to be about the same, price-wise - am I wrong?&nbsp; And Agnandi seems to have more veg options, which would be good for my husband.<br /><br />We&#039;ll probably give our friends a couple of options in the neighborhood - Japanese, Italian, etc. but I&#039;m really hoping they choose Greek because I&#039;d really like to go there myself.

				I&#039;m emerging from the shadow of a breakup with a longtime girlfriend and interested in eating dinner across the table from another human being. Anyone interested in meeting me for food and talk at Aliada&#039;s? Reading these threads, I am scandalized, SCANDALIZED that i haven&#039;t been there before now. I&#039;m not looking for action or anything--just conversation with a new Astorian friend of either gender.<br /><br />Left to my own devices, I would like to talk about food, art (i&#039;m an editor for a representational art magazine), baseball, music or the neighborhood--if that list means anything to anyone.

				My dinner tonight (to go) from Opa! Opa! was delicious - grilled red snapper with lemon potatos, greek salad for one (which fed two amply), and the eggplant salad. $36 (for 2). Awesome.&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />And for this reason, Opa! Opa! is now my favorite inexpensive Greek restaurant.

				To all of you that recommended Agnanti, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!! This was one of the most delicious meals I&#039;ve had in I can&#039;t say how long. I&#039;m 1/2 Greek and feel that I can I&#039;m a good judge of Greek food and this was by far the best Greek meal I&#039;ve ever had. I highly recommend the Saganaki, oh my God! Everything we had was delicious. We say outside and the weather today was wonderful for that. The service was ok, I&#039;ve had worse, I&#039;ve had better, but the food more then made up for it. The cost for 2 people, came to $70 with tip. We had shared 3 apps and the Stripped Bass special. I&#039;ve spent more money on meals that in no way compared to this. We can&#039;t wait to go back and try some other items, but I think I&#039;ll always have the Saganaki. YUMMY.<br /><br />I hope for those of you who try it enjoy it as much as we did. <br /><br />liz<br />

				I think the best outdoor garden would probably be at Cavo.&nbsp; But if you want something more economical, I would highly recommend Aliada or Uncle George&#039;s.&nbsp; The food at Uncle George&#039;s is consistently excellent.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I can&#039;t say the same for the service.&nbsp; Depends on which waiter you get.<br /><br />Has anyone tried Ethos (it replaced Ploes) yet?<br /><br />Also, why hasn&#039;t anyone mentioned Sagapo (on 34th Ave.)?&nbsp; Excellent food and nice outdoor seating, but a bit on the expensive side.

				They have pretty much all the same things as other greek restaurants, and the waitress can list them all for you (in fact, the first thing they ask is if you have been there before). Your fish you choose by going to the counter and picking out the one that looks tastiest :)

				Agnanti has already been mentioned, but there&#039;s a reason: the food is excellent. The fish/seafood is always fresh and very light, and the various cheeses are outstanding. I&#039;ve had a few problems getting refills of water, but beyond that everything is fantastic from the food to the atmosphere to the relatively reasonable prices.

				I ate at Aliada&#039;s last weekend and I don&#039;t know what all the fuss is about. The people working there are indeed very friendly and provided excellent service. But the food was decidedly so-so. My pork chops were overcooked and dry. My companion didn&#039;t think much of her combo platter. We both liked the saganaki quite a bit. Lemon potatoes were great, but I haven&#039;t met an order of lemon potatoes that I didn&#039;t like. <br /><br />The atmosphere was much nicer than Uncle George&#039;s, but the bill was much higher. If I&#039;m going to spend more than Uncle George&#039;s, I&#039;m going to Zenon or Stamatis.

				Pinocchios has always been excellent when I tried it.&nbsp; I just wish they renovated and had less of an 80s look to it!<br /><br />Omonia has always been my favorite cafe in Astoria, and I am eager to try the new food.&nbsp; It&#039;s a great atmosphere without the thumping music so you can actually talk.&nbsp; And they have a piano player on the weekend nights.&nbsp; If you haven&#039;t been for a while, go check it out!

				I went to Zenon for the first time in my many, many years living in Astoria.&#160; I thought the place was a disaster and am totally baffled by any positive rating, zagat or otherwise, they may have had.&#160; The service was horrible beyond description.&#160; The place is a veritable dump.&#160; The food was decent at best.&#160; I went easy on the first visit and ordered grilled chicken.&#160; It was served semi cold.&#160; It came with a side of lemon potatoes that were mostly&#160; burned.&#160; There was nothing remarkable about the seasoning. To start I had a salad which was served so cold my teeth felt like they were going to disintegrate...All and all, and i really hate to say this, i thought the place was awful.&#160; There is much, much, much better Greek food in Astoria.

				S&#039;Agapo is another really good restaurant, and has a lot of unique menu items for Greek restaurants in this area.&nbsp; My main problem with them is that I feel they are quite pricey compared to other comparable Greek restaurants in Astoria.&nbsp; Easily more expensive than a Stamatis or Kyklades or a Zenon even though it&#039;s at the same general level.&nbsp; That&#039;s certainly been my impression, even though their food is quite good!

				I would actually be *less* concerned if there&#039;s a cat in the restaurant than if there wasn&#039;t one...think of it as having a 24-7 exterminator on site!&nbsp; Of course, though, the Health Department would disagree with me on this.

				Loukamadis on Ditmars and 45th is really fantastic. Same chef owner that was at Ploes. Out of the way now yes, but just so nice, friendly and delicious. His regional specialty is casseroles.&nbsp; <br /><br />I like seeing a cat around. Without one there will be mice (or worse) around at all times.&nbsp; A restaurant is not a self contained space that can be sealed off. Basements connected to other basements is the reason for rodents getting around. Same for places connected by dry wall and not brick walls.&nbsp; A cat actually keeps most mice away just by their presence. Mice smell them.<br /><br />As for Opa Opa, we love the tacky fake plant vine covered walls and ceilings, fake cave like construction painted bright white and all the old and dated decor.&nbsp; Never had more that a plate of mixed grill there so can&#039;t really say much about the chef skills. <br /><br />Sorry to hear Zenon took a dive, never went much but always loved the food.<br /><br />

				I finally ate at Agnanti and I really couldn&#039;t wait to come and share my experience with friends, and of course, on here.<br /><br />I took my parents; my dad studied in Greece for a semester in college so he was really eager for some authentic Greek food. I&#039;ve eaten at a lot of different Greek places in Astoria in the 3 years I&#039;ve been living here, but Agnanti blew me away--everything was delicious. <br /><br />It was crowded as the restaurant is small (and there was no outdoor seating yet), so we did wait for a table, but once we were sat everything was great. I asked the waitress to make a wine recommendation and what she brought to us was fantastic. Everyone loved it. <br />The greek salad was so authentic; the tomatoes delicious and the vinegar dressing they added was wonderful! Best I&#039;ve ever had. Each of our main courses were also great.<br /><br /><strong>I MUST SAY HOWEVER, THE HIGHLIGHT OF MY EVENING (being the girly girl in my twenties that I am) was when I turned around to motion for the check and saw Matthew Broderick walking in--with Sarah Jessica Parker right behind him!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! </strong><br /><br />I was astonished to find them in Astoria--so close to my apartment! SJP looked so thrilled to be there and hugged her friends who were waiting at a large table when they arrived. She immediately made a comment about how delicious the food looked (as you know you can see what the kitchen is putting up right when you walk in the door) and was so chipper and happy to be there. I felt like the only person there who noticed them; no one else bothered them, which I felt was great as I also wanted to leave them to their meal and not bother them or stare.<br /><br />Overall, greaaaaaaaat night! Who would have thought to see such great celebrities in Astoria dining out! It was obvious props to Agnanti and after having such a wonderful meal, I wasn&#039;t surprised to be seeing them there to enjoy the cuisine as well! :lol: :mrgreen:
