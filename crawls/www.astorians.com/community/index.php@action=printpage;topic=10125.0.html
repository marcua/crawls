				Body Of War is a documentary of Tomas Young, a young man who joined the military 2 days after 9/11 to go to Afghanistan to fight against those who attacked us. Instead he was sent into Iraq and was shot his first week there and became paralysed. This film documents the exaggerations and lies given by Bush and congress as reasons for going into Iraq, and shows the devastating impact the severe injury has had on Tomas Young physically and emotionally. The film is currently being shown at the IFC theater on Sixth Avenue and 4th Street in Greenich Village. Below is a link to the film with a trailer. I highly recommend everyone who cares about what our troops are going through to see this film.<br /><br />http://www.bodyofwar.com/ (http://www.bodyofwar.com/)

				Duska, alot of people care but they are still oblivious of the realities of what the troops actually go through. The Bush administration has disallowed the media to take photos of the coffins coming home for all these years. If we don&#039;t get to actually see the fallen and the injured to remind us of the consequences of being in Iraq, we as a people will be less likely to take action to pressure the government to bring aboput a solution to end the occupation in Iraq; we can still be here 5 years from now having the same discussion.<br /><br />TRX, thanks for the link. I appreciate our congresswomen Carolyn Maloney being among the advocates favoring getting our troops our of Iraq. Supporting the troops doesn&#039;t mean leaving them in Iraq indefinitely to get hurt or killed, it means finding a reasonable way to begin bringing them home.

It never occurred to me that there <em>could</em> be people who don&#039;t know someone over there. Personally, I have dealt with it very close to home. The psych evaluations our troops get before they&#039;re allowed back in to the &#039;civilian world&#039; are retardedly inadequate (at least they were in 05, maybe they&#039;ve changed since) and what ends up happening is loved ones end up looking after those who have just gotten home and can&#039;t cope. Maybe my response seemed bitter to many ppl, but when you are reluctant to go to work in the morning because you don&#039;t want to leave a grown man alone in his own house for fear of his state of mind, you tend to forget to care about how someone might take your opinion. <br /><br />In short, my bad, considering the amount of troops we have over there, I never thought there could be people who haven&#039;t heard horror stories from loved ones stationed there. So I guess the irony is me being oblivious of oblivious people ... <br /><br />I still don&#039;t believe a movie is going to get anyone to actually start a movement to change anything. But that is, again, just my opinion, and it&#039;s an incredibly bitter one.

				I hear you Duska, you&#039;ve obviously been exposed to the repurcussions of our returning troops not getting adequate treatment first hand. The film may only be 1 piece of a 1,000 piece puzzle, but unfortunately the news of how the war in Iraq is effecting our troops is not front page news, often times it&#039;s not reported on at all. The films Stop Loss and Body of War are more for raising our consciences than entertainment. People often times prefer to be oblivious, it makes the world that they existent in seem safer. But you have a right to be bitter, those who defend our country deserve the all the respect and care we can provide them.

				FZ, you are recommending the documentary Obsession, which glorifies the widening of the war in Iraq to other muslim countries, yet you refer to the Body of War, a documentary that brings to light the effects of the Iraq War on our troops as a &#039;schlokumentary&#039;. Normally I would try to reason with you the difference between seeing the world in only black &amp; white extremes, but seeing your anti-islamic propaganda avatar, I would only be wasting my time and energy.<br /><br />To more fair-minded individuals, I do encourage the viewing of the Body Of War film, or at least in educating ourselves on what our returning soldiers are going through when they finally return from combat.<br />

				A big part of the problem of our returning troops getting the proper care has less to do with beauracracy and more to do with the with the current administrations and the pentagon&#039;s MO turn out the injured ASAP from the VA hospitals, this is for both physical and emotional problems.

Also, many&nbsp; vets, refuse&nbsp; treatment, due to many factors, including pride&nbsp; and&nbsp; seeing care for&nbsp; &#039;unseen&#039;&nbsp; wounds&nbsp; as being &#039;weak.&#039; Many are sent for care and&nbsp; refuse it.

When you appease&nbsp; and trade&nbsp; with a Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Saddam, or even a tin horn dictator, it usually ends in a bigger tragedy. For decades&nbsp; we did not have good enough intelligence&nbsp; for many reasons, cutting back on CIA/Defense spending, which seemed logical , after the Soviets&nbsp; fell.&nbsp; Saddam continued&nbsp; to bluff, as it turned out, but, if we did nothing after 9/11 to Saddam and he&nbsp; was sanctionless, and arming&nbsp; more terrorists top get our troops, we could be just as bogged&nbsp; down in&nbsp; Afghan and worse&nbsp; cause Saddam was still there&nbsp; and laughing as he was killing us. <br /><br />I think we get&nbsp; bogged&nbsp; down sometimes, I do it too, on who is right or correct. The truth is&nbsp; removing Saddam was correct, removing the Taliban was correct. For over decade everyone in the world wanted it done, then, when The US/UK and a few other nations do it, they get crucified. I think it&#039;s worng, especially, when all the bood that is being shed.&nbsp; Saddam didn&#039;t&nbsp; pay for&nbsp; trips&nbsp; like&nbsp; this cause&nbsp; he&nbsp; wanted to be friends, he wanted to be sanctionless&nbsp; to get&nbsp; us after 9/11, he had murals&nbsp; depicting himself as Xerxes, with&nbsp; the planes&nbsp; flying into the WTC, in his palace, that our troops found when they came in. Iran doesn&#039;t want an example&nbsp; of&nbsp; free people next door. I hate to see us, Americans, sniping at each other.

However, here is&nbsp; a post from Daily Kos, link doesn&#039;t work anymore, but, this&nbsp; was up for Sept, 19, 2007.... &quot;This has been digging at me for, oh, about 4 years now. I have been hesitant to express this thought, in comments sections and in discussion with other people about the Iraq quagmire for fear of, I don’t know, being called mean. Or, un-American. Or something.<br /><br />Supporting the troops essentially means supporting the illegal war. It seems that us anti-war types have been doing all sorts of mental and philisophical gymnastics to try and work around this. What has emerged is a sort of low impact, mealy-mouthed common wisdom that is palatable to everyone but is ultimately going to allow us to stay in Iraq for years to come.<br /><br />Even Jim Webb’s shelved equal time legislation carries the scent of this erroneous wisdom.<br /><br />Now, I don’t intend to demean Jim Webb. He is determined and impressive in his stance against the war and the crippling of our military. But this kind of legislation allows us to comfortably continue to support acts of aggression, as long as we give the troops a long enough break in between.<br /><br />Until we have another draft, this is a volunteer armed services. I am not even beginning to count the numerous mercenaries that are involved in the occupation.&nbsp; You signed up, you get to go to the desert and risk being shot at by brown skinned people who don’t believe the lies you’ve been told. A war of aggression is immoral, period. If you believe in God, you can damned well be sure you are going to hell for your participation in it. The only troop I support is the man or woman who refuses to be deployed so that they can make the middle east accessible to profiteers who don’t give a flying F about morality or democracy. Or a soldier’s life.<br /><br />When Sunni tribes got paid off enough to stop shooting at GIs and instead shoot at Al-Qaeda (in reality themselves) it is funny how they suddenly became Freedom Fighters.&nbsp; During WWII, French resistance fighters were also called terrorists and insurgents by their German occupiers. Can an anti-war proponent look at these Iraqi resistance fighters with the same admiration, even though they worship differently than us and when they eventually win are likely to install a distasteful (to Americans) theocratic tinged state. Can a person who doesn’t believe in violence support that people’s right to govern themselves, perhaps violently.<br /><br />I am sorry but supporting the troops means supporting this illegal war.....&quot;<br /><br />The Huffington Post and Daily Kos, two of the most popular &#039;left&#039; sites out of&nbsp; thousands like it, in print and media, routinely&nbsp; call &#039;Hamas&#039;, and even Al Qeada, &#039;resistance&#039; fighters, claiming&nbsp; they are the equivalent&nbsp; of the French Resistance to the Nazis, which the US troops&nbsp; are&nbsp; the Nazis. Of course, there have been Senators like Dick Durbin, who compared the&nbsp; liberation fo Iraq from Saddam to the actions of Nazis, Soviets&nbsp; and&nbsp; Pol Pot...http://english.aljazeera.net/English/archive/archive?ArchiveId=13014&nbsp; This was used by Al Jazeera, as has been the&nbsp; some of the movies, like&nbsp; &#039;Redacted&#039;&nbsp; that took the incident of some troops, who were convicted, for raping a girl. Redacted was shown in theaters in Syria recently, this set off&nbsp; a&nbsp; mob after it&#039;s showing, to spill into streets and attack the US embassy/interest sections. Of course no women were allowed into&nbsp; the theater. On and on. This is NOT &#039;Anti-War&#039;, this is &#039;Anti-American&#039; and suicidal. The worldwide Al Qeada/Jihadist&nbsp; movement&nbsp; is&nbsp; not just in Iraq&nbsp; or Afghan. It&#039;s in Europe&nbsp; and even our own City, you can see some of their work in what was once the WTC.<br /><br />It&#039;s a shame that those who disagree with the current administration have to resort to supporting the enemy. If anything else, this undermines their entire argument. During the Cold War, Democrats and Republicans were able to disagree with each others on policy without losing sight that our common goal is to defeat Communism. A House divided cannot stand. If the West allows internal disagreement to overshadow our common goal of defeating totalitarian Islam, Western Civilisation will fall the same way as a divided China in the face of Japan during WW2.

				That is incredibly convenient that you can&#039;t find a link to that article. Do you at least remember if it was an editorial letter or an actual article?<br /><br />Secondly, everybody I know who dislikes the administration supports our troops. What I find incredibly pathetic is certain people who disagree with the those against the war have to resort to calling us terrorist supporters or troop haters. I love my country. I love the honorable warriors who defend us, give their lives for us and protect us. I dislike my current administration.

This is&nbsp; not about you and me, the people&nbsp; I&nbsp; am pointing to are proven haters&nbsp; of the way of life of this nation long before&nbsp; Bush took power and this is&nbsp; their latest ploy. Film after film depicting the troops as murderers, rapists, and not ONE&nbsp; supporting the brave attempts and sacrfice&nbsp; of the troops is not love of troops in my view. Another&nbsp; &#039;documentary&#039; is coming out Abu Ghraib this&nbsp; week. Yet, we have seen ZERO&nbsp; about Al Qeada, the forces blowing up and killing our troops and Muslims&nbsp; alike in Iraq, Afghanistan and around the world. I&#039;m glad you love&nbsp; your country, so do I, I find making constant attacks&nbsp; on the mission and focusing on incidents&nbsp; that are wrong, committed by some troops, as destructive and prolonging the war and given &#039;comfort&#039; to the enemy. I dislike&nbsp; what Clinton did&nbsp; in&nbsp; Bosnia, but, when the troops&nbsp; were commited, I wasn&#039;t rushing into the street accusing them of genocide and the leaders of being evil monsters. If anything I see the hysteria coming from the so-called&nbsp; &#039;anti-war&#039; side and their only dislike&nbsp; focused&nbsp; on the President and their fellow&nbsp; Americans who voted for him. <br /><br />Now, please&nbsp; provide&nbsp; me a link to the &#039;Pro-War&#039;&nbsp; movie, or even one that&nbsp; shows&nbsp; the terrorists, who happen to be Islamic. They are hard to find.

We definately have a failure to communicate. When I talk about the extreme left that has done everything possible&nbsp; to make the soldiers and armed&nbsp; forces, including&nbsp; the 24 year-old nephew look bad, as someone who is here, I&#039;m gonna speak up and defend their mission. Contrary to what&nbsp; you may believe, they are out ther eand in large numbers and making &#039;schlockumentaries&#039;&nbsp; and movies, that jepordize&nbsp; the lives of the armed&nbsp; forces.&nbsp; Yes, most soldiers&nbsp; are &#039;gung-ho&#039;, but, that doesn&#039;t mean they love war, they&#039;re not&nbsp; insane. Thanks for the links, as for Saving Private Ryan, yes, WW 2 movies&nbsp; almost always&nbsp; show&nbsp; the allied side&nbsp; as being positive. I was talking about this war, not somalia, or a hundred&nbsp; other battles.<br /><br />Propaganda is&nbsp; not a&nbsp; dirty word, and can be used&nbsp; in a myriad&nbsp; of ways. The vast majority&nbsp; of the movies made since&nbsp; 9/11 have been negative, and downright lies and propaganda&nbsp; serving the enemy. Whether&nbsp; that is the intent, is irrelevant.&nbsp; The only movie I recall&nbsp; showing the even 9/11, brave civilians in a positive&nbsp; light is United 93.&nbsp; &nbsp;
