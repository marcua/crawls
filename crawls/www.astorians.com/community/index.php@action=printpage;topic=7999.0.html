				lobber, thanks for the reply. I guess my intent in posting was to open up a discussion. And yes, while I agree with you the illustration is simple, I think it was meant to simplify the presentation of what I believe into imagery instead of an essay which no one might have wanted to read through anyway. I also found it pretty long, but worth it.

				The phrasing looked very familiar... Is it from a particular text? I want to say Locke or something...<br /><br />(I admit, I didn&#039;t see through it all b/c flash runs really slow on this computer and the music was getting on my nerves.&nbsp; Adn I&#039;m already a firm believer in the principles it was presenting.)

				I liked it.&nbsp; I thought it was a clear and concise way of presenting basic ideas behind the concept of personal liberty.&nbsp; I do not consider myself a libertarian on the whole, but I know I have some libertarian tendencies.&nbsp; The presentation resonated with me.&nbsp; I liked it so much, I included a link (http://megcotner.com/links/) to it on my website.<br /><br />I also found the way the author used symbols to be quite fascinating.&nbsp; The way they manipulated the hand, hats, and such really helped to carry the message through.<br /><br />Thanks to edava for posting it.

				Though I tend to think that the decisions people/governments make are not so much free will but rather the inevitable logical product of the forces which affect them, I did like the video, pretty much because its slant was at my angle.&nbsp; Its a great way to open up discussion on a whole range of ideas, but I would agree it is overly simplistic.&nbsp; Terms which it threw out definitions to, like property, were ambigious.&nbsp; Before the higher concepts of the video can be discussed, the nuts and bolts have to be addressed (unless the nuts and bolts were the purpose of the video, which then would make it perfectly brilliant).<br /><br />Because of this ambiguity, I&#039;d agree with the remarks that such can be manipulated to prove just about any point.&nbsp; The war for oil could be argued for, or argued against using the logic of the video.<br /><br /><br />Visually I dug it alot.&nbsp; The music though was exasperating.&nbsp; &nbsp;
