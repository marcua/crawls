			For info on what Vallone has done, check out the following links:<br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Vallone,_Jr.<br />http://council.nyc.gov/d22/html/members/home.shtml<br />http://www.licalliance.org/pages/graffiti/debate.pdf<br />&nbsp;<br />One of the most important things Vallone did for Astoria was to lead the fight against the proliferation of power plants.&nbsp; He represented C.H.O.K.E.(Coalition Helping Organize a Kleaner Environment) and Astoria residents in court and won a major victory against the New York Power Authority that lead to the closing of the Charles Poletti Power Plant in 2010, the worst polluter in the city.

			&nbsp;<br />All for more haiku.<br />But I dont have one for you at this time.<br />&nbsp;<br />http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/downloads/pdf/crime_statistics/cs114pct.pdf<br />[add salt to taste]<br />&nbsp;<br />It seems to me that when you have a 3 time elected official, you are going to find a good number of satisfied voters. Some even younger than 60.<br />My question, if he runs for BP or DA, who would you rather see run for those offices, and why?<br />&nbsp;<br />Not sure how seriously folks take these questions, in an online forum.<br />Would you give him credit for when crime goes down if you are also looking when some crimes go up?<br />If serious, perhaps some police officers could share their opinions too.<br />&nbsp;<br />[On a flip side, I hope Astoria is not a prime example of a graffiti free zone]<br />&nbsp;<br />Has anyone come across his father&#039;s book<br />&nbsp;<br />Learning to Govern: My Life in New York Politics, From Hell Gate to City Hall<br />&nbsp;<br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Vallone,_Sr.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;

Vallone Scholarships given out every year to very deserving high school seniors?&nbsp; The Vallone family has done so much good for Astoria over the years.&nbsp; We should applaud them and hope that Peter, Jr.&#039;s brother runs when Peter is term-limited out.
