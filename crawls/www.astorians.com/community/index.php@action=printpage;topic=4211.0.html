				i&#39;m looking for a poster of Astoria from 1985. the only one i know that&#39;s left in existence is located in Dino&#39;s Pizza and i already offered to buy it and they aren&#39;t selling it. it&#39;s been in their family since 1985 (so i don&#39;t blame them for wanting to keep it). i&#39;ve moved to Williston Park, Long Island and would like to own a piece of my history so my future kids will know about their roots. <br /><br />please help me locate it. it&#39;s a poster of the map of Astoria that has all the stores that were around in 1985. i&#39;ve seen one or two of them in other stores on Broadway when i was i kid, but Dino&#39;s is the only one that I know still has it.

				It sounds like something a Chamber of Commerce might produce - did you check with the Queens Chamber of Commerce or maybe one of the local commercial associations?&nbsp; Broadway Merchants, 30th Avenue Business group (I don&#39;t know their name).&nbsp; You might also check with the Astoria Historical Society.&nbsp; Good luck!

				<strong>Hell Atlantic</strong>: After you do your research, would you please post it here. There might also be others who would be willing to cough up a few coins for the poster. If there are enough people, if would certainly lower the individual cost.

				i just can&#39;t find any outlet that knows anything about this poster. i&#39;m beginning to think it was just the product of an independent artist who sold his posters door to door. he has probably passed away, who knows. the only thing that give me hope is that i have seen a the exact same kind of poster exact it was for a town in Long Island - it was even for 1985! so it&#39;s either the work of a lone artist who travelled far and wide selling his work or it&#39;s a company that did it.<br /><br />the only thing i can think of is simply going to Dino&#39;s and offering to pay them money to make me a copy. i already called them several months ago offering to buy it from them but apparently the owner values it immensely and won&#39;t be parting with it. i won&#39;t give up trying, but it just sucks that it&#39;s so hard to go about doing this.

				Yes, go to Dino&#39;s and ask if you can look closely at the poster. See if it is signed, and also look around the border, the white part, to see who the printer was. It probably has a copywrite on it. Again, please post the information here, so that others can know what you&#39;ve found. Thanks.<br /><br />Just a thought, I would also contact Julian Wager at the Steinway Street BID 718-721-825. As I recall the poster, it was heavy on the Steinway Street merchants.<br /><br />Good Luck.

				too much work to find this poster. at this point i could probably just create my own poster using data from 1985 and make a killing selling it. no one knows anything about this poster, it&#39;s quite obviously the work of a solo artist selling his work door to door in Astoria. i tried. i think finding the Holy Grail is a much easier task. lol&nbsp; :lol:

				I recall seeing this poster around Astoria stores many years back, not sure if any store or person would still have it unless it was either framed, or rolled up and stored. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find it eventually, just keep on searching.&nbsp;

				That poster was published in the Western Queens Gazette (now called the Queens Gazette). The poster was an ad-sponsored thing, not really a map of legitimate historical merit, but it is still interesting and fun to look through.<br /><br />You could try contacting the Gazette&nbsp; -- (718) 361-6161, qgazette@aol.com, 42-16 34th Avenue, L.I.C. N.Y. 11101 -- but I know their headquarters somewhat and would be surprised if they had any quantity of these posters from 20-odd years ago. They more likely would have it as microfilm or something similar, so perhaps you could summon a printed version from that.<br /><br />Another option would be to visit the Queens Library in Jamaica. Their online catalog -- queenslibrary.org -- says they have all copies of the Gazette from v. 3 (1983) - v. 14 (1995). Assuming that&#39;s true, and assuming their copies are complete, you might be able to at least see the thing if you can determine which edition it was in.<br /><br />I don&#39;t know if it was printed annually, but there were several iterations of that map. Until recently the Raleigh clothing store on Broadway (somewhere between 31st and 33rd, can&#39;t remember exactly where offhand) had later editions of that map. I think theirs were from the early 1990s. But if you blinked you&#39;d miss it in their window, it was that buried. It looked like the maps were all over the base of the display window, but then they put other window display stuff on top of those maps. More recently it looks like those maps have been removed altogether. Hey, maybe the Raleigh store saved those maps for later use. It would be a shame if they threw them out.<br /><br />And in case anyone went to check out this very cool map at Dino&#39;s and didn&#39;t spot it, that might be because they recently moved it into the bathroom. I know they did this because they recently renovated the main dining area and during the renovation they moved that poster and the Sopranos autographed photos into the restroom. I would have thought they&#39;d move those items back to a more visible spot by now, but I guess not. I used to like pointing that map out to people but I&#39;m less inclined to do that now that it&#39;s in the bathroom...&nbsp; :?<br /><br />Hell Atlantic, since you&#39;re probably happy to see this any way you can, and since I was actually *at Dino&#39;s* when I happened to read this thread on my Treo, I took a few pictures of the map. I did not get enough shots to get the whole map but maybe I&#39;ll try and finish the set next time I&#39;m there:<br /><br />http://www.sorabji.com/_/Astoria_1985<br /><br />Hope this helps.<br /><br />-mt<br /><br />

				I wonder, can you see the name of the artist who designed the poster on the copy at Dino&#039;s? If the artist is still around, they&#039;d likely have copies of it.
