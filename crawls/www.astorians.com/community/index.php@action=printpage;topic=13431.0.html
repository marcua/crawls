				I don&#039;t know if I disagree with you on quite as many things as some other people do, but I&#039;m feeling pretty good about it so far. It seems he&#039;s putting a lot of thought into his choices, making sure he gets people who know what they&#039;re doing and those who will be effective and thoughtful. I&#039;m a bit confused by the people who are put off by his choices because they thought he&#039;d put together a staunchly liberal cabinet of Obama cronies, thinking that his current choices aren&#039;t indicative of &quot;change.&quot; But, to me, for him to have done essentially what Bush did - except with liberals instead of conservatives - would&#039;ve been much worse for the country.
