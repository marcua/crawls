				Perhaps the Government&#39;s profile should read something like:<br /><br />Single &quot;Democratic&quot; Government looking for a good time. Likes to read phone records, browse MySpace, drop bombs, and invade Iraq. <br /><br />http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19025556.200?DCMP=NLC-nletter&amp;nsref=mg19025556.200<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><em>New Scientist</em> has discovered that Pentagon&#39;s National Security Agency, which specialises in eavesdropping and code-breaking, is funding research into the mass harvesting of the information that people post about themselves on social networks. And it could harness advances in internet technology - specifically the forthcoming &quot;semantic web&quot; championed by the web standards organisation W3C - to combine data from social networking websites with details such as banking, retail and property records, allowing the NSA to build extensive, all-embracing personal profiles of individuals.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				that was interesting.&nbsp; not particularly shocking since all the info that&#39;s on myspace is voluntarily posted for public review but it&#39;s interesting in how the pentagon/nsa/cia are probably the most forward thinking institutions in the government.<br /><br />most likely, they&#39;re collecting and data mining all the profiles to learn how the social dynamic on the internet works and evolves.&nbsp; from this research they can learn insights into how threats emerge and migrate from one part of the world to the next through the internet.

				I kind of rather think that this practice would be a no brainer. I have hesitated to put too much personal info online because of my paranoia about this sort of thing being implemented, although it is easy to do so, and I probably have. I don&#39;t have anything to hide, but the more that the government has to work with the more that they can use it to their advantage and possibly my disadvantage.<br /><br />In some ways this is clearly a good thing. It seems that I hear about would-be-Columbine-copy-cats being caught through their candid posts on MySpace every month or so. Clearly some of these kids/adults/whoever are wanting to be caught, otherwise they wouldn&#39;t be so public with their plans - either that or they are just plain stupid, which is probably a good bet as well.<br /><br />I do agree that there can be a lot of valuable and interesting research that can come out of this sort of practice. How they use this research is the scary bit.<br /><br />However, the government cannot really be blamed for spying or snooping on MySpace (or Friendster, etc.) when the information provided there is provided voluntarily for anyone to read. It still feels like they are stepping on my democratic toes, though, but I recognize that I can&#39;t get fully mad when I have done half the work for them just by being social and candid online.
