				My yard has always been bombarded with those little pot baggies, but lately I am seeing rusty razor blades and vials all over the place. I found razor blades on my own property several times. I found vials down on Shore Blvd in Astoria Park and more razor blades in the playground and in front of an abandoned property. All this in the course of a few days. Is drug use on the up upswing here? I remember when you could find needles laying around, but I thought those days were over. Anyone else noticing the same? What do we do about it? I don&#039;t want my kids picking this crap up off the street one day. Not like 114 is going to do anything about drug use. They are too busy writing traffic tickets.

Some of it looks medical related (tubes/hose-like apparatus) but other than the obvious stuff, I&#039;m not sure what most drug-related equipment looks like. <br />To be on the safe side, I stick to the mostly flat dirt areas of the park when I walk my dogs. It&#039;s easier to see what&#039;s on the ground so that I&#039;m not digging something dangerous of their mouths.

				Those tubes/ hose things are what junkies use to tie off. This is getting ridiculous. The park was FILTHY this morning. I can&#039;t even walk my dog there anymore because he&#039;ll be eating everyone&#039;s food they throw on the ground let alone razor blades on the damn playground. There needs to be a police officer stationed in the park 24/7 as a beat cop. It&#039;s getting a reputation as somewhere you can go at any time and do whatever you want because there are no consequences.

				It&#039;s too bad that these druggies don&#039;t die sooner rather then later,it&#039;s more then a trash,sanitary issue. <br />Some of these people commit crimes to support their habits. Many a times I have seen a car parked on my block<br />late at night/early am and I see somebody lighting up inside their car. This is a few blocks off Roosevelt Ave in Woodside<br />cops have more important things to do at night of course like writing tickets for an expired inspection sticker,etc.<br /><br />You guys have to figure out where they buy the drugs from,has to be a source near the park or maybe even inside the<br />park itself. <br />

				I was told recently by a fellow close to folks at the 114th that there is a strong heroin trade that seeped in from Long Island. It is centered down by 20th Avenue/Astoria Park. I was told to use caution when biking in that area, but I&#039;ve yet to hear of any actual violence stemming from whatever it is that is going on.<br /><br />I have only seen strange looking people wanderign about in that neck of the woods which means nothing as this is NYC. No needles, no vials, just some wackadoodles looking rather lost.<br /><br />However, I do see empty weed bags around all the time, but then again, Astoria seems to be NYC&#039;s answer to Amsterdam. I smell it in the park and on the streets all the time. I am surprised they don&#039;t sell it in the cafes!<br /><br />
