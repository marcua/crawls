Hopefully soon.&nbsp; As for absentee landlord comment affecting our &#039;hood.&nbsp; That&#039;s not entirely on target.&nbsp; Most of NYC is absentee landlord and management companies and that place turned out pretty well.&nbsp; <br /><br />And I can&#039;t wait for the Greenway to be completed.&nbsp; Something is better tha nothing and I love the eat river and veiws of the city.&nbsp; Wish we could afford the apartments down by Gantry park. Would buy there in a second.&nbsp; They are doing a great job of building a new community with parks, schools, clean spaces and Vernon has turned into quite the street for food, drinks, cafes, etc...</div>

Take a look at those other communities that these chains have outlets in. Those are the peer communties for Astoria. <br /><br />Now contrast this with the remaining mainstream stores. Fewer and fewer each year.<br /><br />Now walk down Broadway. Look and the people and listen to their languages spoken. Count English speakers. Take a look at how the people are dressed. What stores they patronize. <br /><br />Now take a look at the communities that have the B&amp;N and compare these (admittedly off the cuff) observations of Astoria with those communities.<br /><br />Astoria will never have a B&amp;N for the same reasons the Elmhurst or Corona will never that them. Perhaps 10 or 20 years ago, but certainly not today. And as the community continues to be hollowed out with a decline in services and rise in absentee landlords undoubtedly there will be none in the future.<br /><br />And yes, the old Oyster Bay spot on Broadway would have made a nice store and stuff. But you should get the impression by now that something like that is not going to happen - if it did, it would have been built long ago. Perhaps because those folks that control the real estate (and by extension, our community) really doesn&#039;t want that for us. I don&#039;t have an answer. But I do know that they tried their damnest a decade or so ago to close Bohemian Hall so that should tell us about what they think is good for our community. <br /><br />Talk to any of the cultural groups (no I don&#039;t mean the Fed of Italian Charities and the like) that are trying to exist in this community - they will tell you it is hard ground with scant support from the political or business community. <br /><br />The developers do have a big say on what is important around here. All you need to do is ride a bike up our death defining &#039;Greenway&#039; to discover that.<br /><br />Just one person&#039;s opinion. <br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Gleason you made me laugh. If anything you are very consistent. I like you, really, but I worry for you. You see demons around every corner. The stress of a disposition like that will shorten your life. Cheer up things aren&#039;t so bad.<br /><br />Can I ask you what you mean by count the English speakers -- is it see how many Greek and Italian speakers there or maybe you&#039;re referring to another language? You&#039;re an Astorian lifer, yes? As far I can remember the native-English speakers in Astoria always seemed to be in the majority, am I right? So what&#039;s so different today? </div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_95876">I feel so much better that there is an upscale pizza place in our community - it sort of negates everything else said. As to LIC being a fantastic place (wasn&#039;t this a discussion of Astoria?) I guess your idea to to hollow out our community like they did to Hunters Point and Dutch Kills, dangle some incentives to the homeowners to move, then bulldoze what is left.<br /><br />Yes, that is one solution, but you know, we kind of like it here just the way it is. You got a problem with that? <br /><br />And as a taxpayer and voting citizen (and someone who actually stayed awake during civics) I have every right in a public forum to comment that I expect my tax dollars to go towards improving my services (as opposed to satisfying campaign chits) and to vocalize my concerns on the deterioration that I, my friends, and neighbors see in the community around us. <br /><br />But this is really not a thread on your ideas or mine, but observations on the community. To the points raised I would invite you and others to post and make this a lively debate. It is perfectly fine to have a difference of opinion. It may make certain sectors, who crave glassy-eyed uniformity, uncomfortable, but, what can I say? Such is the nature of American political discouse since this republic was founded.<br /><br />One final point: that &#039;Greeenway&#039; bike lane is a $6 million dollar joke. Someone is going to get killed taking a bicycle into that traffic and it will become an impassible nightmare once all those buildings some of you want go up. If that is what they want to spend my taxes on, then they just might as well leave my hard earned money in my pocket. <br /><br />Our community deserves a waterfront park, not turning a valuable community resouce over to the highest bidder. This is what is happening in the rest of the county. I do not know a single example except the working class communities in Brooklyn and Queens who are treated like this. I do not know why new residents in LIC get a park (to say nothing about new wiring from Con Ed) while the rest of us get blank walls (and old rotten wiring that should have be replaced a decade ago).<br /><br />Those who made those discisions let us down and bury us in bullcrap when we question it. <br /><br />Pure and simple.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

Many of the chains that opened in Astoria have branches in Corona, the Bronx, Jamaica and the like. Only 10 years ago there were three places I could by Florshiem shoes on Steinway. Today, I can shop on that street dress myself like a hip-hop artist. Seamans Furniture moves out, El Mundo Discount moves in.<br /><br />This is the opposite of trends in shopping in Manhattan or downtown Brooklyn. Even long term residents and boosters of the local shopping that have spent their entire lives on local streets have told me that they are sadly writing them off. I used to be proud of our shopping areas. Now they look like they way that 14th Street used to be. <br /><br />Take a look at the comments from posters on this board. Are they happy? Thread after thread on wishful thinking and dashed hopes. <br /><br />As to the cafes being filled with people, from my conversations with business leaders, it seems that a good portion of those patrons are people who do not live in our community. For example, the Greeks, like other ethnic groups, are moving out of Astoria. Being a tight-knit community, many come back here frequently to shop and hang out in those cafes.<br /><br />The big question is not why those cafes continue to grow (while their local population shrinks) but why the population of young professionals that supposedly are moving in have almost no impact on stores, meeting places, and the cultural life of our community. <br /><br />This is the kind of thing that B&amp;N looks for.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_95881">Interesting points, Gleason. (Never thought I&#039;d say that...!)<br /><br />It does seem like shopping for clothes, furniture, housewares, etc., is less of an option in the neighborhood than it seems it used to be. On the other hand, the number of coffeeshops, non-Mediterranean restaurants, bakeries, specialty stores, etc., are growing rapidly.<br /><br />On the first point, I suspect that a lot of this has to do with the growing number of big-box stores farther out in Queens, and peoples&#039; ability to drive to Ikea to get furniture. I kinda doubt that the neighborhood is getting any poorer, looking at recent changes in rents and property values. Instead, people spend their money elsewhere. The Internet might take a little blame too, as people do more shopping on-line. <br /><br />While shopping can be &quot;outsourced&quot; to other neighborhoods efficiently, I strongly disagree that the quality of &quot;meeting places&quot; is decreasing at all. To the contrary. (Just on Ditmars alone, Freeze Peach, Oleput, Fatty&#039;s/Crescent and Vine, Waltz, etc., are all new and great meeting places.) And regarding &quot;a good portion of those patrons are people who do not live in our community&quot;, as far as I&#039;ve seen, this only applies to the Beer Garden. It may be that the old-timers don&#039;t recognize us yuppies as &quot;people who live in our community&quot;, but there certainly are plenty of yuppies here, and they support both the old-time butcher shops and the new-fangled organic groceries. They just don&#039;t buy shoes on Steinway.<br /><br />To restate, I assert that the changes in shopping patterns in Astoria over recent years are due to both Astoria-specific changes (more immigrants, more yuppies, higher property values), as well as to global patterns of more-efficient but less neighborhood-based shopping for major items. Both of these changes are probably good on balance, although I agree that there are an excessive number of 99 cent stores...<br /></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_95882">just a few quick notes as I would like others to post... tons of points raised in this tread that I would love to see others post on....<br /><br />The cafes &#039;catering to outsiders&#039; info came comments from my friends in both the Greek community and merchants.<br /><br />As to rents climbing in Astoria, so what? Go to East New York and Mott Haven - rents going through the roof in those communities, too. The local leaders and property owners I speak to don&#039;t feel that its from economic revitalization (that one got a dry laugh from one guy I talked to), but demand from immigrants &#039;pouring through broken borders&#039; in ones civic leader&#039;s words. <br /><br />I am pleased as punch on the places you did mention, but, if you read the paper and see stuff posted on the web they have a small presence. That footprint needs to be a hell of a lot bigger to catch the attention of corporate types in B&amp;N head office. You will need clothing stores and houseware stores and the like, as well as much more cultural activities at a level that will give a clear indication to them that the demographics fits their image.<br /><br />Merm, perhaps moving this thread to politics?</div>

You got a problem with that? <br /><br />One final point: that &#039;Greeenway&#039; bike lane is a $6 million dollar joke. Someone is going to get killed taking a bicycle into that traffic and it will become an impassible nightmare once all those buildings some of you want go up. If that is what they want to spend my taxes on, then they just might as well leave my hard earned money in my pocket. <br /><br />Our community deserves a waterfront park, not turning a valuable community resouce over to the highest bidder. This is what is happening in the rest of the county. I do not know a single example except the working class communities in Brooklyn and Queens who are treated like this. I do not know why new residents in LIC get a park (to say nothing about new wiring from Con Ed) while the rest of us get blank walls (and old rotten wiring that should have be replaced a decade ago).<br /><br />Those who made those discisions let us down and bury us in bullcrap when we question it. <br /><br />Pure and simple.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><br />I don&#039;t have a problem with people voicing opinions as I hope no one would have a problem with me voicing mine. I also have no problem with anyone disagreeing with my opinion, we can either discuss the matter further or agree to disagree. And if someone points out something I&#039;ve said simply isn&#039;t true or maybe offers an alternate way of looking at an issue than I say A+ to that (though I don&#039;t always like it).<br /><br />I agree with you 100% that the Greenway plan is a complete joke and a waste of money. We deserve better. Unfortunately though there are still vital remnants, not relics, of our industrial past occupying large portions of the western Queens waterfront that make the dream of a waterside bike path, well a dream. <br /><br />But in regard to our community deserving a waterfront park. Am I confused? Don&#039;t we already have several? Astoria Park and its extension Demarco park. Socrates, Rainey, Queensbridge and our newest, Gantry. I say, not too shabby.<br /><br />Like it or not, the residential development in LIC replaced derelict, formerly manufacturing PRIVATELY OWNED land. In return for government help and a change in zoning the developers turned over a portion of their privately owned land for a public park so you can say our elected officials did get something back for the people.<br /><br /></div>

The main reason why there are few housewares or clothing stores on Ditmars and the shopping streets in the neighborhood, aside from Steinway, has less to do with current immigration patterns and changes to the ethnic composition of the neighborhood than it&#039;s not how people shop any more. These types of shops left the avenues long, long ago, before the neighborhood &#039;changed&#039;.<br /><br />In fact started decades ago with the rise of shopping malls and branded stores -- simple as that. Malls pulled shoppers, selling branded items that people wanted to buy, away from the shopping streets here just as they did across the country. We are lucky though that other types of stores, mostly food-related, moved in and were able to find a market for their businesses. I say lucky because there are many towns and cities in this country with ghost towns for main streets.<br /><br />Everyone wants to return to this supposed golden age of yesteryear where you can buy everything you need within three blocks of your house, from Ma and Pa who own that treally authethenic shop. Its never going to happen.<br /><br />And finally, the neighborhood isn&#039;t getting poorer. It&#039;s pretty much as it always was. The only difference is the price of real estate, which is insane and shouldn&#039;t be used as a a marker or proof of anything.<br /></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_95903">There seem to be several different retail zones in Astoria - for example, you have the big box stores on Northern Blvd., chain eateries/entertainment near the Kaufman Astoria 14, discount stores on Steinway, restaurants on Broadway, more restaurants and cafes on 30 and 31 Aves.&nbsp; If a Barnes and Noble or Borders were to open in Astoria, I&#039;m thinking that it would be most likely to open on Northern Blvd. or near the Kaufman Astoria 14.<br /><br />But like 28Grand and Debbie pointed out, our consumer behaviors have changed.&nbsp; It would be great if more bookstores opened in Astoria, but even it they don&#039;t, I know that I can go somewhere else in Manhattan.&nbsp; I don&#039;t look at the lack of a national chain bookstore in Astoria as a sign of decline or that we&#039;re less well off than other Queens communities.&nbsp; I also think it would be great if another independent bookstore opened - why wait for a big chain?</div>

But then again isn&#039;t that the nature of this Neighborhood?&nbsp; The arrival of such places like Oleput, Sparrow, Freeze peach, Il bambino, Valverde and many interesting clothing and furnishing shops do show that certain groups are having a positive impact in Astoria. I for one love it.&nbsp; As for the cafes filled with visiting peoples, well yes and no.&nbsp; If you look close you will see many of the recent and not so recent Astorians enjoying the establishments.&nbsp; The mix seems to be doing very well. <br /><br />It does bother me that some people in here harp on the &quot;Ethnicity&quot; of certain types and how they may or may not be tax paying citizens from uncertain &quot;broken borders&quot;.&nbsp; Why would anyone move here with that mentality? And if you have always been here then how can you not see that the diversity of Astoria is what really makes it a great place.<br /><br />Concerning tax payer dollars, absolute agreement that we could do with some serious infrastructure upgrades.&nbsp; The parks are looking better but how about some new power lines.</div>
