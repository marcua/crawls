				Obama has a website in which he explains in more detail every one of his plans.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been all over it lately.&nbsp; I had no idea til this weekend, how far the smear campaign against him had gone.&nbsp; My mother lives and works just an hour and a half north of here, with a lot of Republicans, and is a Democrat, but not very involved.&nbsp; Emails and lies that have been told to her, had her believing that Obama is Muslim and not a Patriot.&nbsp; Such stupid lies to be telling but the emails have been going around since before his campaign even started.&nbsp; I had to spend a lot of time on that site dispelling those outright lies.&nbsp; He has been attacked so much that his web site has pages devoted to the issue. <br /><br />If you have questions regarding his plan or the man himself, check out his web site.&nbsp; http://origin.barackobama.com/issues/

				Here&#039;s a blog post about some of his accomplishments in just the US Senate. He was very effective in the IL Senate before that, too.<br /><br />http://obsidianwings.blogs.com/obsidian_wings/2006/10/barack_obama.html (http://obsidianwings.blogs.com/obsidian_wings/2006/10/barack_obama.html)<br /><br />The topics discussed are: nonproliferation, avian flu, regulating genetic testing, medical malpractice, energy reform, ethics reform, government contracting reform, etc...<br /><br />He&#039;s not as accomplished a Senator as Senator Clinton, but then again, he&#039;s not running for Senator...

				I thought I posted my Obama endorsement here, but I think it got lost in the outage. This is why I think that we actually can:<br /><br />Here you have a politician who not only talks about acting to cross the party lines, but actually has a history of doing so (http://&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/03/AR2008010303303.html&quot;). He&#039;s also made friends across the aisle (http://&quot;http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2006/0609.larson.html&quot;) that have helped move forward on nonproliferation incentives (http://&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/02/AR2005120201509.html&quot;). He has a vested commitment to transparency in government (http://&quot;http://www.barackobama.com/pdf/TakingBackOurGovernmentBackFinalFactSheet.pdf&quot;), both in funding and spending. He&#039;s written bills to make a searchable database (http://&quot;http://www.usaspending.gov/&quot;) of who receives federal grants and contracts. He&#039;s been preemptive about avian flu (http://&quot;http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:s969is.txt.pdf&quot;) before it was a major health concern (http://&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/06/opinion/06obama.html?ex=1275710400&amp;en=69f51e47097d5dd9&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&quot;) but not about &nbsp;war (http://&quot;http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Barack_Obama&#039;s_Iraq_Speech&quot;).<br /><br />And you can talk about whether or not he&#039;s experienced, whether the viral internet, massive money raising campaign he&#039;s working is prompt and effective, but you can&#039;t argue with the enthusiasm and hope that he&#039;s given to people my age all around this country. We&#039;re paying attention to politics. Disillusioned kids who&#039;ve seen our parents&#039; sorry attempts at &quot;revolution&quot; and mock them for it and here is this guy with views we like and a voice that sounds like ours and he&#039;s not playing the game dirty. <br /><br />This is someone I would vote *for* and not against. What matters right now is that so many people who didn&#039;t care before, care now. Whether or not this man has the skills to be a better President than the brand name that is Clinton is immaterial. Even if Clinton were to make a better President, to see Obama lose to a creation of the political machine would further alienate an entire generation that is already dangerously close to throwing up hands and giving up on American Brand Politics altogether.<br /><br />I will fully acknowledge that I&#039;m probably too young to know better; that I&#039;m a hopeless idealist and that, when I hit 30, reality will most likely shoot me in the face like I metaphorically went hunting with Dick Cheney and all these silly things like passion and inspiration and worthless catchphrases like “change and hope” will ring as hollow to me as they do to you. But right now, they don&#039;t, and I&#039;m clearly not alone.<br /><br />Yeah, I think we actually can.

				Daisy, Harlan, Paratactical . . . all fine and well. We&#039;ve all heard the stuff before. What I want to know NOW, before Denver, is what are his plans to fix all HIS issues.

He still hasn&#039;t said a word about platform positions. I can hear what he says he WANTS to do, but HOW does he plan on doing those things.

				It doesn&#039;t matter what Obama or Clinton have done (or haven&#039;t done); despite the rhetoric, the policy documents, and assorted hoo-ha that makes its way into the papers, politics is an intensely emotional process. And people vote largely on the basis of emotion.<br /><br />Look at Bill Clinton. He was in effect a nobody from a minor state most Americans dismiss out of hand. (Although he was extremely effective establishing a base w/in the Democratic Party at this time -- that man was always thinking ahead to the White House). And in 1991-92, he managed to knock out an incumbent president who had had the highest approval ratings ever.<br /><br />Remember the swooning over Bill&#039;s persona? The sax playing. The rock &#039;n roll. His youthful exuberance. The boxers(?) That&#039;s what got him elected; not a &quot;what has Bill done for me&quot; rational calculus.<br /><br />Hillary simply does not have the emotional draw for people. She is a technocrat. A policy tinkerer. And a full-on establishment politician. These traits have served (and will continue to serve) her well as a senior Senator from a state that values these things. New York likes its machine politicians, no matter which party they&#039;re from. Because politics are more institutionalized here than in other states, what with unions, public-private entities (e.g. The Port Authority), a strong, entrenched legislature, powerful&nbsp; lobby groups, etc. Moreover, she is a strong supporter of regulation and government intervention, which a lot of New Yorkers want from their politicians.<br /><br />Then there are the negatives. And her detractors (in both parties) are legion. The primary results clearly lend weight to the fact that nationally, most people just don&#039;t want her.<br /><br />It&#039;s not her time. Probably never was.<br /><br />But New York will still accept her (I presume she doesn&#039;t have to relinquish her seat to run for president) and most likely will remain its senator for a good dozen years or more. Her local supporters at least have that to look forward to.

				The other point I want to make is that <span class="bbc_u">the President doesn&#039;t write laws</span>! In some sense, it hardly matters what Obama wants to do with Medicaid. He&#039;s not the decider (on new laws). He only gets to negotiate and threaten vetos. <br /><br />In my view, the most important thing is that he can inspire a working majority to solve problems. If he is inspirational and popular, the congress will want to ride his coattails and pass good bills. Clinton has good ideas and is a clear master of the system, but if she alienates people, she won&#039;t be able to inspire solutions. <br /><br />Popularity matters for Presidents.

And as the chief executive, he is responsible for executing and upholding laws through the government bureaucracy.<br /><br />Moreover, each major federal agency or department has a legislative affairs staff whose role is to liaise with Congress and congressional committees for the purposes of drafting legislation (bills). For instance, the Patriot Act was largely initiated by the Executive Branch, specifically the Dept of Justice.<br /><br />While a president cannot use his legal authority to impose legislation on Congress, he can persuade Congress to enact legislation based on his agenda. Thus the Pennsylvania Avenue two-step.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=9553.msg113500.html#msg113500">Quote from: enigmacat on February 20, 2008, 01:18:46 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">But, the Patriot Act is commonly blamed on Bush and his cronies, right? </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Of course. But that view conveniently fails to take into account the fact that the bill passed by a huge margin in the House (http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2001/roll398.xml) AND in the Senate (http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=107&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00313).<br /><br /><br /><br />edit: At the risk of sounding glib, one thing Obama has done is secure the endorsement of the Teamsters Union (http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D8UU6RO80). Add that to the Service Employees Union last week, and it looks like Big Labor is pinning their hopes on him.<br />

				Bush (barely) carried himself on not being Al Gore, frankly.<br /><br />But just to bring it back to 2008: <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=9553.msg113501.html#msg113501">Quote from: Pulled pork on February 20, 2008, 01:23:55 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">What Obama has going for him is a fresh new generational thing.&nbsp; He is intelligent, community minded, a senator and something new.&nbsp; He has strong support and people want change. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I agree that people want change. And that&#039;s why Obama AND McCain are front-runners. Their respective opponents are essentially old-guard. Romney, uber-corporate management wank, is so 90s. Huckabee is a even further throwback 80s GOP evangelicalism.&nbsp; :yuck: And of course, there&#039;s Hillary Clinton, who conjures up her own brand of history, good and bad. Mostly bad.<br /><br />It&#039;s no surprise to me how strongly McCain and Obama have polled with those who regard themselves &quot;moderates&quot; or &quot;independents&quot;. Personally, I believe Obama to more to the left than Hillary, which will come out more and more as we move toward November (yes, I think Obama will get the nomination). That&#039;s why I predict McCain will win in a very close race.

				Let&#039;s not forget about the hugely &quot;extended&quot; executive powers during Bush&#039;s two terms.&nbsp; Signing statements, which are essentially line item vetoes.&nbsp; If anyone in congress legitimately wanted to proceed with impeachment hearings, the place to start would be with these signing statements, which completely corrupt the idea of checks and balances, balance of powers, etc... and usurps the legislative branch by essentially rewriting passed legislation by congress.&nbsp; The very essence of signing statements by the executive branch, IMHO, is completely unconstitutional.

The road to reform does not lead through Washington and a hugely expensive, bureaucratic, government-controlled system. John McCain will harness competition to offer more affordable insurance options for as many Americans as possible, leveraging the innovation and cost-effectiveness of our nation&#039;s firms to put an end to existing rigid, unfriendly bureaucracies. He will build a national market where insurance is more available, portable, and accessible across state lines; in which patients&#039; rights are respected and their information under their control; and one in which people may save more in tax-exempt Health Savings Accounts. He will assist those who need help in getting private insurance.<br /><br />John McCain will provide incentives for a national market - including the reimportation of pharmaceuticals - that offer greater transparency about effective patient care, options for preventative care and therapies, and prices so that competition makes it easier for families to navigate toward quality and low cost. He will demand reform to medical malpractice laws to curb abusive lawsuits that squeeze doctors, prevent innovation, and drive up the cost of health care.

The Bush Administration has been extremely lax about enforcing our trade agreements, and workers are suffering as a consequence. There were more trade enforcement actions in one year of the Clinton Administration than in six years of the Bush Administration. Hillary will appoint a trade enforcement officer within USTR who will be responsible for ensuring that our trade agreements are vigorously enforced. She will also double the size of the enforcement unit. The current staff is too small to monitor and enforce the increasingly complex agreements.<br /><br /><strong>A New National Family Leave Policy.</strong> Hillary Clinton’s national family leave initiative will set a goal of having all states adopt family leave programs by 2016. To help states reach this goal, Hillary will commit $1 billion annually in a Family Leave Innovation Fund and ramp up as states develop initiatives. The Family Leave Innovation Fund will support state-level parental leave programs across the country. The Innovation Fund will also work in partnership with states that create family leave programs by offering competitive matching grants to cover state start-up costs and a meaningful portion of program expenditures. The fund will not dictate from Washington what approach states should take. Instead, the fund would support all approaches to providing more leave to employees including through Temporary Disability insurance or Unemployment Insurance programs, expansion of direct support programs like At Home Infant Care, or through individual and business tax credits. In addition, Hillary will direct the Secretary of Labor to develop model state legislation and employ technical assistance teams to provide support to states in passing and implementing such programs.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Now, I want to hear from Obama. <br /><br />I don&#039;t mean to be redundant, but the time has come for him to not only talk the talk, but walk the walk!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

If you folks want to debate the rest of your stuff, open your own thread, or take it to somewhere else . . . like off-site.<br /><br />I am looking for information here. I don&#039;t want to put this off and let my questions go unanswered.

				I am getting the feeling that asking any question about Obama will keep getting me the same response. It&#039;s not that I feel Obama supporters are negating my questions, but rather negating my feelings that he doesn&#039;t have any real plans of action to put forward that aren&#039;t simply dreams and hopes.<br /><br />When Clinton says that she &quot;will direct the Secretary of Labor to develop model state legislation and employ technical assistance teams to provide support to states in passing and implementing such programs&quot; that is the how. When she says that she &quot;will direct the Secretary of Labor to develop model state legislation and employ technical assistance teams to provide support to states in passing and implementing such programs&quot; that is the how. When McCain says that he &quot;will provide incentives for a national market—including the reimportation of pharmaceuticals—that offer greater transparency about effective patient care, options for preventative care and therapies, and prices so that competition makes it easier for families to navigate toward quality and low cost&quot; that is the how.<br /><br />Obama keeps speaking about what he thinks all Americans want to see happen, but he never says how he plans on making them happen. And no, not everything is up to Congress. Not everything requires Federal legslation to become reality.<br /><br />For example, why should I care if people who got caught up with the subprime rate mortgages get bailed out. Hell, I raised and educated a basketball team of kids, worked full time, got 2 post-grad degrees and never was able to afford even the damn down payment for a house when you had to put down real money to buy/own one. With a country full of people struggling to pay off their student loans why isn&#039;t SOMEONE proposing finding a way to bail them out of some of their debt?<br /><br />I know that my values are quite different from most of the people on this forum. But they are age-appropriate, and I am not looking forward to a future of homeless women, who have lived decent, respectable lives and find, in their old age, that this country is now so absorbed with the problems of the young that there are no plans for anything other than warehousing them in pitiful living arrangements while Germany, Israel, Denmark, Canada and France (just to name a few) are covering all medical expenses, and most living expenses for their senior citizens who are no longer required to pay any taxes. <br /><br />I am alarmed that the major divide between Clinton and Obama is age and not the usual requisites like race, religion, gender or locale. <br /><br />I&#039;d always thought that the next American civil war would be between the have and the have-nots, but it is starting to look like it just may be between the idealistic young (and some aging, formerly radical HIPPIEs) and the reality-based wisdom of their elders. It doesn&#039;t matter to me. I will probably be laughing at today&#039;s youth, fending off the dreams of the next generation, from the grave!<br /><br />One other thing, then I will crawl back into my troglodyte cave, I really can&#039;t understand how, after all the reading I have done and the not finding answers to my questions, so many people are backing a candidate based on faith. When will Americans learn that if they don&#039;t remember their history that they are doomed to relive it. George McGovern made all those promises in 1972 about an immediate pullout from Vietnam and hundreds of thousands of people, including me, held rallies all over the country in support. Nixon was elected by a HUGE majority. McGovern/Shriver also never told us HOW!

				At this point we in NY are along for the ride.&nbsp; Its going to be Obama or Clinton based on what happens in TX, OH and maybe PA.&nbsp; If Hillary doesn&#039;t pick up at least 2 of those states somewhat decisively she&#039;s done.&nbsp; If she does, Obama is done.&nbsp; NY already had its primary, so all we can do is wait and see.&nbsp; No amount of discussion of Obama vs Hillary matters in NY anymore, most supporters of either one will vote for the other in the general election.&nbsp; Excessive bad mouthing of either will only hurt Democrats in the general election.<br /><br />I think Clinton supporters are just a little stressed b/c she has an excellent chance of losing this nomination, and some people are having a hard time with that.&nbsp; As long as Obama has a majority of pledged delegates (which currently he does) I think the DNC will coerce enough of the super delegates to go along with that to avoid a fight at the convention.&nbsp; And the Clintons may have to accept that for the good of the party.&nbsp; The situation could be reversed should Hillary do really well in these last three primaries of course.<br /><br />And gosh NYCMacuser, you never answered that one question, are you working for the Clinton campaign, because you are very on point.&nbsp; :evil:

To lower drug costs, Obama will allow the federal government to negotiate for lower drug prices for the Medicare program, just as it does to lower prices for our veterans. He also supports allowing seniors to import safe prescription drugs from overseas, and will prevent pharmaceutical companies from blocking cheap and safe generic drugs from the market.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Protect and Strengthen Medicare: Obama is committed to the long-term strength of the Medicare program. He will reduce waste in the Medicare system, including eliminating subsidies to the private insurance Medicare Advantage program, and tackle fundamental health care reform to improve the quality and efficiency of our healthcare system. Obama supports closing the &quot;doughnut hole&quot; in the Medicare Part D prescription drug program.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Provide Transparency to Medicare Prescription Drug Plans: Many seniors are enrolled in Medicare prescription drug plans that are actually more expensive for them than other available plans. Obama will require companies to send Medicare beneficiaries a full list of the drugs and fees they paid the previous year to help seniors determine which plans can better reduce their out-of-pocket costs and improve their health.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Strengthen Long-Term Care Options: As president, Obama will work to give seniors choices about their care, consistent with their needs, and not biased towards institutional care. He will work to reform the financing of long term care to protect seniors and families. He will work to improve the quality of elder care, including by training more nurses and health care workers.<br /><br />Protect and Honor Seniors<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Ensure Heating Assistance: Obama will increase funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) which helps low-income citizens — many of them seniors — pay their winter heating and summer cooling bills.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Support Senior Volunteer Efforts: Retired Americans have a wide range of skills and knowledge to contribute to local and national public service efforts. Obama will engage more interested seniors into public service opportunities by expanding and improving programs like Senior Corps to connect seniors with quality volunteer opportunities.<br /><br />Barack Obama&#039;s Record<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Social Security and Pensions: In the midst of the 2005 debate over Social Security privatization, Obama gave a major speech at the National Press Club forcefully arguing against privatization. He also repeatedly voted against Republican amendments that aimed to privatize Social Security or cut benefits. Obama has also voted to force companies to properly fund their pension plans so taxpayers don&#039;t end up footing the bill.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Medicare: Obama has supported a number efforts to strengthen Medicare, including voting for legislation to allow Medicare to negotiate for cheaper prescription drug prices and to extend the enrollment period for low-income beneficiaries.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Protecting Seniors: After reports that lobbyists, but not the American people, received information about the most unsafe nursing homes in the country, Barack Obama demanded the Department of Health and Human Services release that information to the public. Following Obama&#039;s letter, the names of the four Iowa care facilities cited for unsafe care were released to the public. Obama&#039;s efforts follow his successful efforts in Illinois to make nursing home information public and strengthen elder abuse laws.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The only thing Obama doesn&#039;t mention here compared to the examples you posted is that he is going to have is cabinet staff talk to the legislatures, which is a given.&nbsp; But other than that, I don&#039;t see how Clinton, McCain or Obama differ as far as offering specifics.

Since you cited healthcare, here is just an example (lifted directly from http://www.barackobama.com/issues/pdf/HealthCareFullPlan.pdf) :<br /><br />OBAMA’S PLAN TO COVER THE UNINSURED. Obama will make available a new<br />national health plan which will give individuals the choice to buy affordable health<br />coverage that is similar to the plan available to federal employees. The new public plan<br />will be open to individuals without access to group coverage through their workplace or<br />current public programs. It will also be available to people who are self-employed and<br />small businesses that want to offer insurance to their employees.<br />The plan will have the following features:<br />&gt; Guaranteed eligibility. No American will be turned away FROM ANY<br />INSURANCE PLAN because of illness or pre-existing conditions.<br />&gt; Comprehensive benefits. The benefit package will be similar to that offered<br />through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), the program<br />through which Members of Congress get their own health care. The new public<br />plan will include coverage of all essential medical services, including preventive,<br />maternity and mental health care. Coverage will include disease management<br />programs, self management training and care coordination for appropriate<br />individuals.<br />Affordable premiums, co-pays and deductibles. Participants will be charged<br />fair premiums and minimal co-pays for deductibles for preventive services.<br />&gt; Subsidies. Individuals and families who do not qualify for Medicaid or SCHIP<br />but still need assistance will receive income-related federal subsidies to keep<br />health insurance premiums affordable. They can use the subsidy to buy into the<br />new public plan or purchase a private health care plan.<br />&gt; Simplifying paperwork and reining in health costs. The plan will simplify<br />paperwork for providers and will increase savings to the system overall.<br />&gt; Easy enrollment. The new public plan will be simple to enroll in and provide<br />ready access to coverage.<br />&gt; Portability and choice. Participants in the new public plan and the National<br />Health Insurance Exchange (see below) will be able to move from job to job<br />without changing or jeopardizing their health care coverage.<br />&gt; Quality and efficiency. Participating hospitals and providers that participate in<br />the new public plan will be required to collect and report data to ensure that<br />standards for health care quality, health information technology and<br />administration are being met.<br /><br />NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE EXCHANGE. To provide Americans with additional options, the Obama plan will make available a National Health Insurance Exchange to help individuals who wish to purchase a private insurance plan. The Exchange will act as a watchdog and help reform the private insurance market by creating rules and standards for participating insurance plans to ensure fairness and to make individual coverage more affordable and accessible. Through the Exchange, any American will have the opportunity to enroll in the new public planor purchase an approved private plan, and income-based sliding scale subsidies will be provided for people and families who need it. Insurers would have to issue every applicant a policy, and charge fair and stable premiums that will not depend upon health status. The Exchange will require that all the plans offered are at least as generous as the new public plan and meet the same standards for quality and efficiency. Insurers would be required to justify an above-average premium increase to the Exchange. The Exchange would evaluate plans and make the differences among the plans, including cost of services, transparent.<br />-----------<br />I am by no means trying to sound condescending, but I really am not seeing the lack of &quot;How&quot; here. You can go through any of their sites, and I do believe Barack, Hillary and McCain all have very detailed outlines on all of them. <br />

She needs a 70+ split between OH, PA &amp; TX to have a shot so long as MI &amp; FL are out. I don&#039;t think Dean is going to go back on the MI &amp; FL ousting (it would be a terrible break for the party) and even if she got a 60/30 split in the last three states, she&#039;d need to court away some super delegates (which would also be really divisive for the party).

				<br />Some of Hillary&#039;s support has moved towards Obama in recent weeks. Obama is heading towards 50%+<br />And I was surprised to hear that TX chooses many delegates by caucus which suits Obama&#039;s organization.<br /><br /><br />Even if some voters might later choose between Obama and Nader, that would be in the general election.<br />In the Democratic primary, wouldnt they still choose Obama?<br /><br /><br />Just curious, I wonder where Nader is registered to vote and what his party enrollment may be?<br /><br /><br /><br />Some speculation is that Edwards might back Obama if it comes down to later primaries&nbsp; &nbsp;:-o

				Check out this article, &quot;The Obama Craze: Count Me Out.&quot;&nbsp; It accurately details some facts about Obama, beyond the facade of change.&nbsp; Personally, I was aware of several of these facts already, and they are all reasons why I personally do not share the Obama craze that so many others across the country now seem to.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the link: http://beyondchron.org/news/index.php?itemid=5413<br /><br />And just a couple of excerpts:<br /><br />&quot;And though he often cites his background as a civil rights lawyer, Obama voted to reauthorize the Patriot Act in July 2005, easily the worse attack on civil liberties in the last half-century. It allows for wholesale eavesdropping on American citizens under the guise of anti-terrorism efforts.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Since taking office in January 2005 he has voted to approve every war appropriation the Republicans have put forward, totaling over $300 billion. He also voted to confirm Condoleezza Rice as Secretary of State despite her complicity in the Bush Administration’s various false justifications for going to war in Iraq. Why would he vote to make one of the architects of “Operation Iraqi Liberation” the head of US foreign policy? Curiously, he lacked the courage of 13 of his colleagues who voted against her confirmation.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;And in March 2006, Obama went out of his way to travel to Connecticut to campaign for Senator Joseph Lieberman who faced a tough challenge by anti-war candidate Ned Lamont. At a Democratic Party dinner attended by Lamont, Obama called Lieberman “his mentor” and urged those in attendance to vote and give financial contributions to him. This is the same Lieberman who Alexander Cockburn called “Bush’s closest Democratic ally on the Iraq War.” Why would Obama have done that if he was truly against the war?&quot;<br /><br />Looks like I&#039;m going to stick to voting third party.

				<br /><br /><br />DODD: Well, it wasn&#039;t about why not Hillary. And I know people look at these things and say you&#039;re choosing one over the other. I really believe having spent more than a year on the trail, in countless forums and debates, I got to watch obviously Barack Obama over the years. <br /><br />We serve on two committees together here, Wolf, on the Foreign Relations Committee and the Labor Committee. I got to see him up close and in a very personal way in that debate. And I believe that he&#039;s touched a responsive chord in the country that you and I haven&#039;t seen in a long time. And I don&#039;t think that&#039;s inconsequential.<br /><br />I think for the first time in 25 years, instead of hearing just about Reagan Democrats, I&#039;m hearing about Obama Republicans. Independents and Republicans who are as attracted to this candidacy of Barack Obama as many Democrats are. That&#039;s a unique opportunity not just for a political party, which may be important, but more importantly for the country. <br /><br />We are desperate. I&#039;ve said to Barack Obama, you&#039;re getting 18,000 people showing up at the Hartford Civic Center not because they just want to see you. They want you to hear them as well. And that&#039;s what a lot of this is about. Americans are desperate for this country to come together again. &nbsp;<br /><br />I think Barack Obama offers us that opportunity. The last thing is a rejection of my friend Hillary Clinton. I admire and respect her immensely. I just think at this moment Barack Obama offers the opportunity to get elected, and then to lead our country in unique and different ways that Americans are looking for. <br /><br />BLITZER: Your fellow Connecticut senator, Joe Lieberman, has picked John McCain, a man you know quite well. You&#039;ve worked together with McCain for many years. Can Barack Obama go head-to-head with John McCain when it comes to national security issues? <br /><br />DODD: Absolutely. I mean, I think that&#039;s a question -- national security involves many different things. Certainly there&#039;s great respect for John McCain. And you&#039;re right, I have worked with John over the years. And obviously all of us revere the contribution John McCain has made to our country. The time he spent in solitary in the Hanoi Hilton is embedded in our minds in very strong ways. <br /><br />But this is the presidency of the United States. Security depends not only on having a knowledge of our military, but also the security of our economy, the position of our country as it relates to other nations around the world. <br /><br />And I think Barack Obama brings a unique candidacy that encompasses all of that. Not just a knowledge of the military, but also a knowledge of these other issues that I think is going to make him a strong candidate. More importantly, a great president as well<br /><br />...<br /><br /><br />http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0802/28/sitroom.01.html

There&#039;s also an entire group on the Kos that&#039;s said that if Hillary wins, they&#039;ll start campaigning for McCain in hopes that he&#039;ll make everything that much worse so Obama can run again in four years.

				<br />http://www.clarionledger.com/<br /><br /><br />Marty Wiseman, director of the Stennis Institute of Government at Mississippi State University, said he doesn&#039;t expect much crossover voting. It would take an organized effort by Republicans and a lot of money, he said.<br /><br />&quot;I just don&#039;t see Republicans getting that stirred up about this,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#039;s almost impossible, with an even tie, to see who would be most advantageous to the Republicans.&quot;<br /><br />A few people approached state GOP Chairman Jim Herring at church, asking whether they should vote in the Democratic primary to skew the ballots toward one candidate or another.<br /><br /><br />&quot;We shouldn&#039;t be fooling in (the Democrats&#039;) business ... because we&#039;ve got enough to deal with,&quot; said Herring, adding that crossover voting also would hinder a two-party system that political leaders have tried to foster.<br /><br /><br />A federal judge ruled last year that Mississippians re-register to vote by party affiliation. Or, he said voters could register as unaffiliated with any party. His decision came after Mississippi Democrats filed a lawsuit seeking to bar Republicans from voting in Democratic primaries. The 5th U.S. Circuit of Appeals is reviewing the decision.<br /><br />Mississippi Democratic Party Chairman Wayne Dowdy said he&#039;s not worried about Republicans voting in the Democratic primary. &quot;We encourage everyone to participate in the Democratic primary,&quot; he said. Asked whether that conflicts with the Democrats&#039; attempts to bar Republicans from voting in their primaries, Dowdy said it does not.<br /><br /><br />

				<br />**<br />questions for McCain<br /><br />http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/15/AR2008021502950.html<br /><br />First, he says war with Iran would be less dreadful than an Iran with nuclear arms. Why does he think, as his statement implies, that a nuclear Iran would be, unlike the Soviet Union, undeterrable and not susceptible to long-term containment unless internal dynamics alter the regime? <br /><br />Second, many hundreds of bombing sorties -- serious warfare -- would be required to justify confidence that Iran&#039;s nuclear program had been incapacitated for the foreseeable future. Does McCain believe that a president is constitutionally empowered to launch such a protracted preventive war without congressional authorization? <br /><br />Third, why would any president not repelling a sudden attack want to enter the pitch-black forest of war unaccompanied by the other political branch of government? <br /><br />**<br /><br />the Obama I know<br /><br />http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-oped0314obamamar14,0,7185898.story<br /><br /><br />In about 20 minutes, he and I investigated the legal details. He asked me to explore all sorts of issues: the president&#039;s power as commander in chief, the Constitution&#039;s protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the Authorization for Use of Military Force and more.<br /><br />Obama wanted to consider the best possible defense of what Bush had done. To every argument I made, he listened and offered a counterargument. After the issue had been exhausted, Obama said he thought the program was illegal, but now had a better understanding of both sides. He thanked me for my time.<br /><br />**<br /><br />I only recently learned that if FL and MI have a redo, the total number of delegates needed for the nomination increases.<br />It is good that those states would get a chance again to play by the rules, and to have their say.<br />But I expect we will end up right back where we are now.<br /><br />Somewhat curious how the turnout would be.<br />

Why does he think, as his statement implies, that a nuclear Iran would be, unlike the Soviet Union, undeterrable and not susceptible to long-term containment unless internal dynamics alter the regime? <br /><br />Second, many hundreds of bombing sorties -- serious warfare -- would be required to justify confidence that Iran&#039;s nuclear program had been incapacitated for the foreseeable future. Does McCain believe that a president is constitutionally empowered to launch such a protracted preventive war without congressional authorization? <br /><br />Third, why would any president not repelling a sudden attack want to enter the pitch-black forest of war unaccompanied by the other political branch of government? <br /><br />**<br /><br />the Obama I know<br /><br />http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-oped0314obamamar14,0,7185898.story<br /><br /><br />In about 20 minutes, he and I investigated the legal details. He asked me to explore all sorts of issues: the president&#039;s power as commander in chief, the Constitution&#039;s protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the Authorization for Use of Military Force and more.<br /><br />Obama wanted to consider the best possible defense of what Bush had done. To every argument I made, he listened and offered a counterargument. After the issue had been exhausted, Obama said he thought the program was illegal, but now had a better understanding of both sides. He thanked me for my time.<br /><br />**<br /><br />I only recently learned that if FL and MI have a redo, the total number of delegates needed for the nomination increases.<br />It is good that those states would get a chance again to play by the rules, and to have their say.<br />But I expect we will end up right back where we are now.<br /><br />Somewhat curious how the turnout would be.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes, the Soviet Commies still did not believe it as a religion and were not as suicidal&nbsp; as the Iranian Islamic Fascists, who would use&nbsp; Nukes&nbsp; in a second.<br /><br />No, The Iranian&nbsp; Govt. could be&nbsp; removed with covert action, enabling Iranians, I know at least half&nbsp; a dozen of&nbsp; former&nbsp; Military, who would happily&nbsp; &#039;end&#039;&nbsp; the Iranian regime, no civilian injuries.&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />It depends on what level of secrey is needed.<br /><br />Thanks for&nbsp; another reason reason not to vote for Obama. The man thinks anything done against the enemy is illegal&nbsp; and&nbsp; believes&nbsp; in a man for 20 years,&nbsp; who after 9/11&nbsp; compared&nbsp; 9/11&nbsp; to defeating the US bombing the Fascist Japanese in WW 2 . Yeah, to Obama&#039;s Reverend, we had it coming. Nice guy, yeah, right. <br /><br />

So in essence he was correct, from his perspective, just as, the Left has made huge billboard size schlockumentaries&nbsp; that&nbsp; fighting the Islamic Fascists with means&nbsp; other than treating it like a crime problem are the reason they &#039;hate us.&#039; No Rev, agree&#039;s wit Abortion, and relations outside of marriage.&nbsp; Second, Falwell apologized, and Bush&nbsp; was not a member of Falwell&#039;s Church. Third, this&nbsp; alleged Rev. is also a&nbsp; &#039;Liberation&#039; Theologist, basically a&nbsp; Marxist thug&nbsp; philosophy that cloaks it&#039;s&nbsp; Communism with a little bit of Jesus.&nbsp; :mrgreen:&nbsp; Further, Obama&#039;s 20 year&nbsp; Rev. think the AIDS virus&nbsp; was created to kill &#039;black&#039; people, 9/11 was&nbsp; an inside&nbsp; job(even Wacky Ron Paul/Bill Maher distanced themselves from those nuts), and that&nbsp; the response&nbsp; of dropping Nukes on Fascist&nbsp; Japan during WW 2 is worse than flying planes into buildings. Obama says he doesn&#039;t agree with &#039;some&#039; of these statements? which one? Can anyone&nbsp; ask anything about this mystery&nbsp; man?&nbsp; Is it even freak&#039;n permissionable or do we need a special license from Sean Penn?&nbsp; :wink:<br /><br />As far&nbsp; as citing Obama&#039;s thinking &quot;anything done against the enemy is illegal&quot;,the post I&nbsp; was responding too is one place to cite, he thinks surviellence is&nbsp; illegal. Also, war in Iraq is Illegal, but, he would bomb Pakistan for some reason, and he would vote against all provisons since 9/11, and meet with all enemy regimes. If one is comfortable&nbsp; with all this, by all means, vote for Obama.

Has any other major American politician ever made a speech on race that comes even close to this one? As far as I&#039;m concerned, it is just plain flat out brilliant—rhetorically, but also in capturing a lot of nuance about race in America. It is so far above the standard we&#039;re used to from our pols.... But you know me. Starry-eyed Obama groupie.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Oh, and Obama wrote the entire thing by himself.&nbsp; What other modern day major political figure can take credit for writing such a monumental speech without the help of their aids and speech writers?

But, all this aside, I would&nbsp; not vote for him simply because of his simplistic stand on the &#039;war&#039; issue, even &#039;Billary&#039; has&nbsp; backtracked&nbsp; out of pulling out too fast.

				ABC and a couple of other news sites point this out as a contradiction:<br /><br />&quot;His initial reaction to the initial ABC News broadcast of Rev. Wright&#039;s sermons denouncing the U.S. was that he had never heard his pastor of 20 years make any comments that were anti-U.S. until the tape was played on air. <br /><br />But yesterday, he told a different story. <br /><br />&quot;Did I ever hear him make remarks that could be considered controversial while I sat in church? Yes,&quot; he said in his speech yesterday in Philadelphia.&quot; <br /><br />http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=4480868&amp;page=1<br /><br />Did he state that he heard anti-U.S comments from Wright in his speech on Tuesday?&nbsp; I can&#039;t find anything yet, but it might be out there.

And while thinking that his &quot;Government created Aids to kill people of color&quot; may just be loony, it is actually a potentionally fatal falsehood.&nbsp; And the man who would choose to lift all of us, failed to speak the truth in his own community. That is not being respectful to your pastor, that is caring less about your community than your own political career.

I think they became&nbsp; more involved in politics&nbsp; when&nbsp; they watched teh nation slipping away. This is when the press focused&nbsp; on their&nbsp; &#039;right&#039;&nbsp; ideology, or as I call it, traditional American values.&nbsp; <br /><br />Yeah, I don&#039;t agree with Robertson on a whole host of issues, including abortion and some&nbsp; othee ideas&nbsp; on some of what is wrong with education, including abortion, but, that Oral Roberts and&nbsp; the late&nbsp; Falwell started&nbsp; a Univeristy for people who saw their&nbsp; values&nbsp; denigrated in public Universities&nbsp; is not&nbsp; their fault, but,&nbsp; a reaction.<br /><br />As for Wright, I&#039;ve run into a&nbsp; lot of&nbsp; &#039;Wrights&#039; and&nbsp; &#039;Farakhans&#039;&nbsp; and they are no where near the equivalent of Robertson of Falwell, more&nbsp; separatist&nbsp; and&nbsp; in league&nbsp; with enemies of&nbsp; this country and believe&nbsp; in a theology far more destructive. I hear you when you say&nbsp; that he is telling people&nbsp; to help themselves, but, when you&nbsp; acompany that with a vicious&nbsp; separatist , violent theology&nbsp; rationale, you are creating more damage than helping. <br /><br />Reminds&nbsp; me&nbsp; of a gentleman I once watched in an interview&nbsp; who was a member&nbsp; of the Nation Of&nbsp; Islam, an organization that believes &#039;white&#039; people are the devil and were created 6,000 years&nbsp; ago by an evil scientist&nbsp; called Yacub. This man was rewarded&nbsp; by Wright and he was at the Million Man March. The good that is&nbsp; done is&nbsp; subverted.&nbsp; Wrights racist&nbsp; remoarks and racial interpretation is&nbsp; destructive, and telling people&nbsp; who are vulnerable&nbsp; to AIDS, more so in poorer&nbsp; communities, that Govt. created&nbsp; it, is&nbsp; downright insane.

But Obama is not running on specific issues. He is running as an &quot;agent of change&quot;. He was supposed to be a different kind of politician, and when he is exposed as using the same tactics as every other politician the veneer comes off. So now what separates him from the others? I could easily vote for and support a person with whom I disagree if I felt that the overriding vision or person was sincere. Specifically, I was willing to suspend my principles of a limited federal government to support an outside the beltway candidate who promised to change the culture of Washington. Now that he is exposed as another opportunistic party hack, I want to know specific positions. I am sure they will be polar opposites of my desires.<br /><br />Oh well, if my fellow citizens elect Obama, I will respectfully support my president.

It&#039;s not Antisemitic. I think the 9/11&nbsp; remarks&nbsp; were in that&nbsp; context, but, again, it hardly rises&nbsp; to the level of this preacher, who has links to Farakhan, and just today, on CNN, no &#039;right-wing&#039; station, showed links to Hamas which he reprinted&nbsp; in the church&nbsp; newsletter. It reads&nbsp; like Neo-Nazi&nbsp; propaganda, &#039;Zionist&nbsp; Wars. &#039; These&nbsp; are not just &#039;social&#039; differences, but, active&nbsp; terrorist groups, that this church supported, and Obama&nbsp; has not left this&nbsp; church, which&nbsp; continues&nbsp; to defend&nbsp; these views. <br /><br />The Evangelical Christians, I have met, in Israel on several visits, from 1983 till 2000, have always been supportive&nbsp; of the state&nbsp; of Israel, certainly would&nbsp; not side&nbsp; with Hamas and anyone trying to destroy it. Second, all&nbsp; Christians are&nbsp; told to preach the gospel to &#039;save&#039; people. Now, do I buy the last part, it&#039;s nice, but,&nbsp; that&#039;s&nbsp; a personal decision. In any war scenario, they mentioned, it was siding with the Jewish people. No doubt, there are &#039;Christians&#039;, well, like this&nbsp; guy Wright, and in many churches, who expouse&nbsp; such ideas, problem is this guy still has links, and he wants&nbsp; to be President and claims to be above&nbsp; it all. You can&#039;t have both. I remember, when Bush visited Bob Jones&nbsp; University, which didn&#039;t allow &#039;interracial&#039; dancing, or&nbsp; dancing at all, I believe, and an uproar ensued and&nbsp; the University changed&nbsp; it policy soon after, no such change is forthcoming here. This church is&nbsp; proud of it, and Obama is&nbsp; a still a member.

				This whole Sodom and Gomorrah story, if I am interpreting it correctly, has a moral along the lines of,&nbsp; &quot;If man lives lives of debauchery, this is what he gets&quot;. I&#039;m sure from terrorists&#039; perspectives, it&#039;s a similar, albeit extremist mentality- they think they are executing the will of god because we live such lives of decadence and sin. (But that&#039;s a whole new thread and another can of worms) My point being, fire and brimstone preaching is not just harmless instilling of fear, and it is not any man&#039;s job to impose &quot;god&#039;s punishment&quot; on others.<br /><br />I respect that Obama acknowledges that Wright&#039;s ideas were wrong, and it speaks <strong>volumes</strong> of him and loyalty that rather than denouncing this man, he summed it up pretty simply:<br />&quot;Rev. Wright preached the gospel of Jesus, a gospel on which I base my life. In other words, he has never been my political advisor; he&#039;s been my pastor. And the sermons I heard him preach always related to our obligation to love God and one another, to work on behalf of the poor, and to seek justice at every turn.&quot;<br /><br />

				Just to make sure that members on the board are properly informed, the official stance of the Lutheran Church Missouri Synod, which is a very respected denomination of evangelical Lutherans in the midwest and are considered &quot;purist&quot; to the theology of Luther and the Scripture, regarding the &quot;Chosen People&quot; is as follows (taken from their website): http://www.lcms.org/pages/internal.asp?NavID=2742<br /><br /><strong>Q. What is meant by the Jews being God&#039;s chosen people? What is their eternal future? Does a Jew who dies without Christ as their Savior spend eternity in hell? Should we, as Christians, pray for their conversion? <br /><br />A. You have asked whether the Jews are God&#039;s chosen people and several other questions related to that issue. The questions are very important and the answers which have been given to them often lead to different and false answers that affect both religious and political views. They are often seen as the basis for establishing the state of Israel as well as the false notion that all Jewish people will be saved.</strong><br /><br />And the LCMS refers to homosexuality as immoral. &nbsp;You can find it on their website as well.<br /><br />There has been many members of the LCMS denomination who have served proudly in all branches of the government. &nbsp;Our proudest moment was when Ed Meese became the U.S. Attorney General. &nbsp;Although LCMS believe in strict separation of Church and State, unlike other evangelicals, the sermons growing up were too often about how much God was punishing homosexuals with AIDS, how African people were savages, and, of course, how Jewish people needed to convert, and soon! &nbsp;<br /><br />I think my point in all of this is that I am not defending what Wright. who by the way, is no longer the minister at Trinity and I did question Obama&#039;s motivation and heart, there are plenty of examples on the evangelical Christian side of intolerance and bigotry (believe me, I grew up in it and that&#039;s why I&#039;m not a member of LCMS anymore) that it just becomes another senseless Politics thread about who is worse. &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />By the way, I was bitter and angry at my church for the intolerant views, but I&#039;ve come to terms with it and, besides, if I hate the LCMS, then I start to hate the people, and I become like the people who lump everyone and doesn&#039;t consider their own prejudices and biases. &nbsp;Peace.

But he suggested that the time is approaching, perhaps by May or early June at the latest, when the primary season should come to an end. <br /><br />“I would hope that after Pennsylvania, and then we have a couple more primaries, I would hope this wouldn’t go much further than the end of May,” he said.<br /><br />

What is meant by the Jews being God&#039;s chosen people? What is their eternal future? Does a Jew who dies without Christ as their Savior spend eternity in hell? Should we, as Christians, pray for their conversion? <br /><br />A. You have asked whether the Jews are God&#039;s chosen people and several other questions related to that issue. The questions are very important and the answers which have been given to them often lead to different and false answers that affect both religious and political views. They are often seen as the basis for establishing the state of Israel as well as the false notion that all Jewish people will be saved.</strong><br /><br />And the LCMS refers to homosexuality as immoral. &nbsp;You can find it on their website as well.<br /><br />There has been many members of the LCMS denomination who have served proudly in all branches of the government. &nbsp;Our proudest moment was when Ed Meese became the U.S. Attorney General. &nbsp;Although LCMS believe in strict separation of Church and State, unlike other evangelicals, the sermons growing up were too often about how much God was punishing homosexuals with AIDS, how African people were savages, and, of course, how Jewish people needed to convert, and soon! &nbsp;<br /><br />I think my point in all of this is that I am not defending what Wright. who by the way, is no longer the minister at Trinity and I did question Obama&#039;s motivation and heart, there are plenty of examples on the evangelical Christian side of intolerance and bigotry (believe me, I grew up in it and that&#039;s why I&#039;m not a member of LCMS anymore) that it just becomes another senseless Politics thread about who is worse. &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />By the way, I was bitter and angry at my church for the intolerant views, but I&#039;ve come to terms with it and, besides, if I hate the LCMS, then I start to hate the people, and I become like the people who lump everyone and doesn&#039;t consider their own prejudices and biases. &nbsp;Peace.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The Lutheran Church of Missouri web site states&nbsp; what I have head&nbsp; Hassidic&nbsp; Jews&nbsp; say that there should be no state&nbsp; of Israel till the coming of&nbsp; the Messiah. But, all these&nbsp; views&nbsp; don&#039;t rise to the level of supporting actual, active, terror&nbsp; groups&nbsp; like&nbsp; Hamas, as this church, and this Rev. who is just as&nbsp; &#039;rich&#039; as that PTL&nbsp; guy who went to prison. Also, Rev. Wright is still on the board, respected and just today, many came out at a press conference, from that church, and defended&nbsp; the Tuskegee and AIDS&nbsp; &#039;conspiracy&#039;&nbsp; theories as&nbsp; the norm in many churches. <br /><br />There&nbsp; can&#039;t be &#039;peace&#039;&nbsp; with such views.

Too many things are coming out right now over a longer time.&nbsp; I&#039;m not trying to be a hyprocrite, as I just spent the better part of these posts defending Obama, but in the light of this bullentin, which Obama quickly condemned 6 months later.&nbsp; I am not backing down at the first sign of trouble; I am, however, going to examine this issue.<br /><br />FZ, you stated that the LCMS is not actively encouraging terrorism against Jews; that is true.&nbsp; However, they are adamant in their belief that if the &quot;Chosen People&quot; do not convert, they will go to hell.&nbsp; I am not familiar with the Hassidic faith, so you will have to tell me how this is similar as you say to the LCMS&#039;s statement.&nbsp; For a Christian, hell is the ultimate punishment, much worse than a terrorist bombing you on earth.&nbsp; Most evangelical churches, if they are true to the strict interpatation of the Bible believe this, but I am sure this will be explained, as well.<br /><br />And again, I want to clarify, since you minimized what the LCMS preach, as you did with the hateful and conspiratory rhetoric of Falwell and Robertson.&nbsp; While the LCMS respect the people of Israel and acknowledge their place in history, they must convert in order to heaven. The mission, then, is to work harder to convert Jews so they can go to heaven as the Chosen People.&nbsp; Do you agree with this activity?&nbsp; I know Jewish friends of mine who are highly offended by Christians constantly trying to convert them.&nbsp; However, taken from the evangelical perspective, they have a calling.&nbsp; Please refer to the links and because I&#039;m not going to quote the whole thing.<br /><br />http://www.iclnet.org/pub/resources/text/wittenberg/mosynod/web/endtme-3.html#et-IIexj<br />http://www.appleofhiseye.org/SupportAOHEnow/WhatleadersaresayingaboutAOHE/tabid/859/language/en-US/Default.aspx<br /><br />It&#039;s so easy to condemn the crazy rantings of people you don&#039;t like.&nbsp; However, it is much more difficult and often painful to realize that your own religion/denomination is flawed. I&#039;m not condemning Christians or the LCMS.&nbsp; My family is well known in the LCMS Midwest and I was studying in high school, under my uncles tutelage to continue the tradition.&nbsp; I know, then, there preachings on the local level and what the Synod has said, in the past at least, because I am no longer a member.&nbsp; <br /><br />Please pardon this seemingly one-on-one debate, group. However, this subject is very important to me.&nbsp; I hate to read that certain extremist views are being somehow &quot;rationalized&quot; and excused, while others are being condemned, when, they are both bad.&nbsp; That is why I used the example, which included their own website, my former denomination.&nbsp; However, when I did try to cite it, it was misinterpeted, again.&nbsp; I&#039;m not going to risk getting kicked off of the board by mods, because there&#039;s so many good aspects of it, so I will leave now.

Because they believe that we can change things. Because they believe in that dream.<br /><br />I know something about that dream. I wasn&#039;t born into a lot of money. I was raised by a single mother with the help my grandparents, who grew up in small-town Kansas, went to school on the GI Bill, and bought their home through an FHA loan. My mother had to use food stamps at one point, but she still made sure that through scholarships, I got a chance to go to some of the best schools around, which helped me get into some of the best colleges around, which gave me loans that Michelle and I just finished paying not all that many years ago.<br /><br />In other words, my story is a quintessentially American story. It&#039;s the same story that has made this country a beacon for the world--a story of struggle and sacrifice on the part of my forebearers and a story overcoming great odds.

				I&#039;m ok with economic regulation. <br />Pure free-market economy, to the best of my understanding, lets the rich folks in power increase their profit at the expense of an aggressively competing lower class, who generally don&#039;t get to move up the ladder as a result. <br />I&#039;m sure there is a fine median between laissez-faire and socialism, I don&#039;t think either extreme works.&nbsp;

Still, I read this&nbsp; today...Bush, British PM push tough approach on Iran<br /><br /><br /><br />WASHINGTON (AP) - President Bush and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown tried to dispel doubts about their relationship Thursday, showcasing personal bonhomie as well as common ground on vexing issues such as the Iraq war, a showdown with Iran, global trade and the crises in Sudan and Zimbabwe. <br /><br />Brown, particularly, appeared to make an effort to move beyond the leaders&#039; frosty first meeting in July. <br /><br />The prime minister, then only a month in office as successor to top Bush ally Tony Blair, was given a coveted invitation to the presidential retreat at Camp David. But he displayed stiff formality that raised questions about whether he would work as closely as Blair had - or much at all - with Bush. <br /><br />That didn&#039;t seem in doubt in the Rose Garden after Thursday&#039;s nearly 90-minute Oval Office meeting. <br /><br />On Iran, Brown offered staunch support for his host&#039;s tough stance on the need to rein in Tehran&#039;s nuclear program. <br /><br />Brown said ``I make no apology&#039;&#039; for seeking to persuade European leaders to extend European sanctions against Iran, to include investments and liquefied natural gas. ``Iran is in breach of a nonproliferation treaty,&#039;&#039; he said. ``Iran has not told the truth to the international community about what its plans are.&#039;&#039; <br /><br />On Iraq, Brown&#039;s focus - like Bush&#039;s - was on the ``substantial progress&#039;&#039; being made by a U.S.-led coalition of troops. <br /><br />Brown announced shortly after taking office that he would reduce British troop levels in Iraq. But that plan, to bring British troop numbers to 2,500 from about 4,000 starting within weeks, is now on hold until Iraqi security forces make gains in driving out militias from the oil-rich southern city of Basra. <br /><br />The two displayed no daylight between them in their views on other key topics as well, including criticism of Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe&#039;s refusal to release results of elections believed to have been won by opponents three weeks ago; frustration with the slow pace of peacekeeping help for Sudan&#039;s violent Darfur region, and belief in the need for a global deal lowering tariffs. <br /><br />The British leader praised Bush&#039;s anti-terrorism leadership effusively, saying ``the world owes President George Bush a huge debt of gratitude.&#039;&#039; He called the president&#039;s programs to battle AIDS and malaria in Africa ``pioneering work.&#039;&#039; He labeled their session an ``excellent meeting&#039;&#039; that left the bond between the two nations ``stronger than ever.&#039;&#039; <br /><br />There was even gentle ribbing about whether Bush actually was going to cook the intimate dinner the two leaders and their wives shared in the evening in the White House residence. <br /><br />Blair&#039;s popularity plummeted because of his support for Bush, making Brown wary up to now about forging ties that are too close. But Brown went so far as to invoke Blair&#039;s name in promising to align himself with the U.S. leader. <br /><br />``As Tony Blair said, we stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the American people and with President Bush,&#039;&#039; Brown said. ``And I continue to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with him in rooting out terrorism wherever we find it in any part of the world which puts freedom, democracy and justice at risk.&#039;&#039; <br /><br />Even before his trip, Brown had said he hoped to strengthen ties through coordinated efforts to shore up the world economy and work on climate change. <br /><br />Brown diplomatically declined to state a personal preference in the race to succeed Bush. Brown met earlier Thursday one-on-one, with Republican presidential candidate Sen. John McCain and his Democratic rivals, Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama, one of whom will be his ally come January. <br /><br />But at Bush&#039;s side, he said: ``It is for Americans to decide who their president is going to be.&#039;&#039; <br /><br />Bush did his part too. <br /><br />The president lavishly praised the contributions and honored the sacrifices of British troops in Iraq, commenting on the ``brilliance&#039;&#039; of British helicopter crews during recent fighting in support of an Iraqi offensive in Basra. <br /><br />And Bush interjected when Brown was asked if the relationship is less special than it was with Blair. <br /><br />``False,&#039;&#039; he said. ``This is a unique relationship. It truly is. And I value my personal friendship, as well as our relationship between our countries. Look, if it wasn&#039;t a personal relationship, I wouldn&#039;t be inviting the man to a nice hamburger or something.&#039;&#039; <br /><br />On Iran, Bush rejected Tehran&#039;s argument that its nuclear activities are intended only for a civilian energy program. ``If that&#039;s the case, why did they have a secret program?&#039;&#039; he asked. <br /><br />http://netscape.compuserve.com/news/story.jsp?floc=MM-news4&amp;sc=1151&amp;idq=/ff/story/0001/20080417/1924673226.htm<br /><br />So, no matter who steps&nbsp; up, they&#039;ll have to deal with the real ongoing threat.

				<br />the Clinton campaign did quite a successful job in connecting in PA.<br />While the win was expected, I found it still a surprise that she won among so many demographics.<br /><br /><br />Her campaign is hitting a stride, hopefully for the right reasons. But I wonder what can really be expected to be won late in the season with a delegate deficit. The deficit is virtually not changed after PA.<br /><br /><br />I am still hopeful that the possibilities of an eventual mandate and platform led by Obama will carry in November. He seems to need to do a better job on party concerns over the economy and health care.<br /><br /><br />There were early considerations of the past with camelot and JFK. I dont know much about that history but Kennedy&#039;s father and other factors were very important.<br />Does anyone have more ideas of which team members have helped Obama come this far to where many expect that he will be the next President?<br />What is the history and experience behind team Obama?<br /><br />It seems Daschle is one key.<br /><br /><br />On a side note, I came across that one McCain supporter was fine with helping Bush v Kerry and v Gore. But if it would come to bringing down Obama, he would instead walk away.&nbsp; &nbsp;:?&nbsp; &nbsp;:police:<br />Interesting times.

				I know it could be close and with small chances. But I am hopeful that the voters of IN and NC will give the Obama campaign a boost. And then perhaps more delegates will share their support for Barack.<br /><br /><br />Voters can now take a more realistic assessment of Obama which is healthy. I am still quite happy with how he has conducted himself through much of this roller coaster.<br /><br /><br /><br />http://my.barackobama.com/page/community/post/zachedwards/gGCSnn<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />For the general election, I wonder if he will plan $ thousand dollar plate fundraisers. Free to do so. But if he wants to be consistent about general election funding, he would either take public financing or voluntarily limit the amount donors may give.<br /><br /><br />___<br />If a &#039;celebrity&#039; opinion helps you:<br /><br />http://myspacetv.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&amp;videoid=33546997<br /><br />&#039;the America that I have been waiting for&#039;<br />

I&nbsp; agree we should have taken Saddam out by other means, but, after 9/11, with us in the region, and Saddam about to go sanctionless, we had to move on him. I think the aftermath, the way that was handled, was what was needed, and wasn&#039;t carried out as it should have been and cost us needless casualties.&nbsp; We couldn&#039;t continue, &#039;appeasing/trading&#039; with Saddam and then saying we support change in the region, it&#039;s bad enough we have to kiss you know what to other regimes in the region, to get oil, and staging for our troops. If you look at how some battles were run in WW 2, it was a horrendous&nbsp; waste of life, and early on, it looked like we would lose, and that was with full support of everyone. This&nbsp; is such a war, except the enemy has no allegiance to nations, code of ethics, or love life. This&nbsp; a diffrent kind of enemy. We are in uncharted&nbsp; waters, but, they have to be stopped.

No, sir, there&nbsp; has been a concerted effort&nbsp; depicting&nbsp; troops&nbsp; as killers and rapists in movies, and schlockumentaries, while saying they &#039;support&#039; them. I don&#039;t&nbsp; see myself as a &#039;victim&#039;, just someone trying to reason, with unreasonable and hysterical&nbsp; accusations.<br /><br />Well, the troops were only &#039;recently&#039; remembered, when all these problems have been around for decades. To point out problems during a war&nbsp; for political capital is just as callous, as ignoring the problem. I do &#039;remember&#039; the troops daily, sir, not as props&nbsp; to win an election, but, as friends and in one case, family, my nephew is on his 3rd tour in Iraq, and after reading posts like these,I often wonder what he is fighting for, certainly this hysterical form of debate is more suited&nbsp; for&nbsp; a&nbsp; street corner brawl than any type of serious debate.<br /><br />Race baiting has served, and does serve, the myriad of race hustlers who use it to stifle debate, it won&#039;t work. Obama will be criticised, and he should be.<br /><br />Talking without preconditions is a mistake, when talking to dictatorships like Iran, N&#039;Korea, Syria. As for Saudi, it amazes, not that much anymore, that Bush and those who want to fight the Islamic fascists, are said they go too far, and yet I hear folks like yourself&nbsp; and many in the so-called &#039;Anti-War&#039; side saying why haven&#039;t we gone after Saudi Arabia, the center of Islamic&nbsp; Faith in Mecca? Where is the logic in this one?<br /><br />This President has done far&nbsp; less than Roosevelt did in WW 2, with interment camps&nbsp; and rounding up anyone even remotely connected&nbsp; to the enemy. This is&nbsp; a new type of war, with an enemy who is not of&nbsp; a formal armed force or nation, some mistakes have been made, but, running around exaggerating the missteps, and even out right lying about what has taken place&nbsp; since&nbsp; 9/11, serves&nbsp; only the enemy, and endangers the troops. Please, at least consider this before making wild accusations. This is not some game.

I have quite&nbsp; a great ability to debate anything with anyone, except on this mostly one-sided board where my responses are ignored, vieled and not so vieled&nbsp; attacks&nbsp; on me personally, are called logical arguments and the clique &#039;nods&#039;&nbsp; in agreement. I have no &#039;blessed&#039; leader save for deity, and I sure as hell have a life outside&nbsp; this board. You can characterise it anyway you want, but, I will continue to post against what i see as wrong and if one wants really to argue the merits, and not ignore the answers, that would be great.

				No, you see you turn things around again.

				I SAY YOU SHOULD ALL GET OFF YOUR HIGH FREAKIN HORSES, :x READING THESE POST SICKEN ME :yuck:someone show me where fz claims to be the victim , he hasn&#039;t.yet i see people call hisposts &quot;a pathetic attempt &quot; and&quot; You no longer have the ability to attempt debate and open discussion&quot; i say bull s#*T,THIS IS FROM THE SAME POSTER WHO CLAIMED THAT WHAT BUSH SAID ABOUT APEAZMENT WAS RACIST , this board does have a liberal bias( including the moderator) i have noticed it .<br />i have sat here and read some of the threads here accusing BUSH OF MURDER...WHO EXACTLY HAS BUSH MURDERED? MARY JO KOPECHNIE? VINCE FOSTER?&nbsp; give me one freakin name........ i have seen him being accused of racism...yet his cabinet has had more minority members than the last presidents . how about if the bush administration tells a lie enough times that they start to believe it&nbsp; is that like the crowd who screamed&nbsp; this is a war for oil and now say the war for oil is a failer,or those who claim to care about the poor Iraqi civilians but want to pull the troops immediately. now i have disagreed with fz&#039;s post&#039;s on occasion mostly about the Iraq war,yet he has never insulted me the way he has been insulted . he has im&#039;ed me and has been very gracious, more than i can say about many of you, his demeanor / what about youres

				Let&#039;s clear up one item here - there is no &#039;liberal bias&#039; on this board.&nbsp; If the majority of us are indeed Liberals, how can there be a bias?&nbsp; We are who we are.&nbsp; FZ seems to antagonize (I do too, admitedly) and desperately seeks to get us to &#039;see the light&#039;.&nbsp; Get over it FZ, not all of us agree with you and you can go ahead and post pages and pages of anti-Islamic propoganda and war propoganda and we still will not agree with you.&nbsp; You can post your opinions whenever you like, just don&#039;t act like a victim :cry:whenever we disagree.&nbsp; What is it your goal?&nbsp; The same people are reading your posts over and over again.&nbsp; I think the Politics area of the board is limited to about ten people.&nbsp; Perhaps you can expand your audience somewhere else, but don&#039;t expect to get us to change our views by repeating the same things over and over again!

I am, of course, speaking in generalities.

				<br />I dont think I am under any illusions. That is how strong my illusions are.<br />But for what it is worth, I want to share this from a wonderful madman who worked probably harder to defeat Bob Barr than any actual candidates.<br /><br />I hope Obama and Clinton supporters will get it ALL together, when the due timing is right.<br /><br />http://knappster.blogspot.com/<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />For those awaiting an explosive outburst ... <br /><br />Sorry, fresh out of those.<br /><br /><br />The English have a saying: &quot;My country -- right or wrong.&quot; With far more historical justification we may say: my party -- in certain concrete cases -- right or wrong ... And if the party adopts a decision which one or another of us thinks unjust, he will say: just or unjust it is my party, and I shall support the consequences of the decision to the end. -- &lt;&nbsp; Groucho&nbsp; &gt;<br /><br /><br />The Libertarian Party has selected its 2008 presidential ticket. It&#039;s no secret that that ticket does not consist of the candidates I had hoped it would include ... but that&#039;s not worth belaboring. The party&#039;s national convention is a caucus in form, and one of the rules of the caucus is that those who choose to participate implicitly agree to support the results. I participated, and I will keep that implicit agreement. I congratulate Congressman Barr and Mr. Root, and pledge to support their candidacy as best I can. I sincerely hope that my fellow Libertarians will do likewise.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				<br />http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/05/28/america/28obama-map.php<br /><br /><br />A Boston Globe analysis of six traditionally Republican states where Obama has signaled he will compete - Colorado, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia - suggests that his confident assertion has validity, but only to a point.<br /><br />Colorado, given its influx of younger, more liberal voters, and Virginia, with its sizable African-American vote and political shifts, are ripe for Democratic coups this year. But any victories elsewhere in the South would require political earthquakes of a sizable magnitude, according to voting patterns, registration data, and interviews with local political analysts.<br /><br />Larry Sabato, a specialist on national voting trends, said most so-called red (Republican) and blue (Democratic) states will remain so. &quot;People shouldn&#039;t think the map&#039;s going to change to orange,&quot; said Sabato, a political scientist at the University of Virginia.<br />

				<br />http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/<br /><br /><br />Most of the seventeen Democratic senators who have remained uncommitted throughout the primaries will endorse Barack Obama for president this week, CNN has learned.<br /><br />Sources familiar with discussions between Obama supporters and these senators tell CNN’s Gloria Borger that the senators will wait until after the South Dakota and Montana primaries to announce their support for Obama.<br />
