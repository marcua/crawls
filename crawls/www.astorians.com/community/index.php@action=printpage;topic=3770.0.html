				So based on the discussion started in the &quot;where to find a synagogue&quot; thread, sounds like people are interestend for some schmoozing over bagels and coffee<br /><br />Proposed Location: Freeze Peach Cafe (we&#39;ll bring the bagels, the schmeer and maybe some nosh from one of the local bakeries)<br /><br />Proposed dates: Sunday October 14th in the afternoon or ????

				Heyyyy- I&#39;m very new to the neighborhood and absolutely deeeeelighted to hear there are other Jews around who want to get together. I think bagels and coffee is a wonderful idea. Sunday isnt the greatest time for me (because it is <em>&#39;simchat torah&#39;</em> and although I am not very observant, my family is and I go home for Jewish holidays to spend some time with them). Keep this forum posted on the date and time you decide to get together, because I&#39;d love to meet you all.<br /><strong><br />-Yasmin</strong>

				Regrettably, it looks like we&#39;ll be out of town the weekend of the 21st-22nd, so I&#39;ll have to take a rain check&nbsp; :-( <br /><br />In general, I like the Friday night services idea because it requires no organization on our part.&nbsp; It&#39;s a set date, time, and place, it&#39;s free.&nbsp; I especially like the idea of trying to do some kind of wine and cheese thing after.&nbsp; If you have a problem with doing a &quot;Jewish&quot; activity, don&#39;t come, it&#39;s that simple.<br />

				I&#39;ll just be coming back from California the day before, so I doubt if I can make it, but I&#39;ll see what I can do, but if not, I&#39;ll definitely try for the next one (since I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be a next one!)<br /><br />And NYCmacuser, I wasn&#39;t try to create a rift, I was just suggesting that the idea be brought up at a gathering that I didn&#39;t think I could be at.&nbsp; I&#39;m perfectly happy to meet up with Jews who want to hang outside of a synagogue.&nbsp; I&#39;m rarely in them myself, but I&#39;d like to feel comfortable going to one in the neighborhood and think it would be great to go with a bunch of Astorians.<br /><br />And I love smoked fish.&nbsp; Just wanted to throw that out there.<br />

				Megc - I indeed took the CSA distribution into account :)&nbsp; but I might just push it back to 7:30pm just in case...<br />Jonathan, I was going to call this week and check with Mich (sp?) if it was OK to snag the couch that night since CSA distribution was going on as well. CSA was the only item listed on their online calender thought so I think it should be OK.<br /><br />It&#39;s not till next week so that should enough time to hammer out further details. <br /><br />

				Hi! ...new to Astorians.com, old to neighborhood. Can join on 21st or other days. Wanted to make gefilte fish for Rosh Hashana and the fish guys on 30th avenue said they don&#39;t sell carp or pike!&nbsp; :cry: If anyone knows which fishmongers sell these, anything from Broadway to Ditmars, would love to try to recreate my familie&#39;s recipe.&nbsp; By the way, they mentioned that there used to be a little Jewish neighborhood here 40 years ago, so they haven&#39;t sold these fish in a very long time!!! If there were only enough Jews in the neighborhood, maybe, just maybe we could all click our heels and the manna/gefilte fish would fall from the sky. o.k. sorry, getting a little carried away here. I probably should just say thanks that Key Food and C Town sell matzo meal finally. Are people bringing bagels? Is this like a potluck?

As for the proposed meetup, it&#39;s our first meetup... I&#39;m bringing the bagels from Brooklyn Bagels on Ditmars, wonderful coffee and tea to be had at the freeze peach, so hope to see you there :)

				Hey all,<br /><br />Tonight is the first night of Friday night services at ACI, if you would like to come. It starts at 8pm and is about half english, half hebrew, with participation/questions encouraged. www.astoriacenter.org for more info. My friend Sybil and I are going we might hang out at a restaurant in the neigbhorhood afterwards if anyone is interested.<br /><br />Miri, I know we&#39;ve been trying to catch up re your study class, so we could perhaps discuss it afterwards, if you are planning on coming tonight and it&#39;s a good time to talk? Either way, looking forward to meeting and talking w/you at some point. Good shabbas!<br /><br />Teresa
