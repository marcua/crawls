				First. Server got hacked (again). And the best thing the support department could tell me to do to &quot;fix&quot; the problem was to start from scratch with the whole site. So with that I decided maybe we had outgrown that provider and I should move to a new one.<br /><br />Selected a new provider and got the data migrated over, then went to update the domain record to point to the new server and lo and behold the domain provider had a hardware failure that prevented (and still is preventing) the records from updating.<br /><br />Next, this morning, after getting all the bugs worked out of the new server install I got up to see that the entire website and all data had been deleted. When I talked to the new provider about it they claimed their backup had gotten corrupted. So, I ended up having to install from the latest back up I had, which - was from the old server.<br /><br />However - I&#039;m not really too impressed with the new provider either. Unfortunately the site is big enough that we don&#039;t fit on a small and cheap provider, but it&#039;s not quite big enough for a full blown dedicated server. Just right in the middle.

				Sorry to be missing some really great threads that were going.&nbsp; Although it was mildly interesting to see what it looks like on screen when one is migrating to a new server.&nbsp; Congratulations . . . and sorry for your troubles.&nbsp; So is all the old data unrecoverable???

				Sadly data from the last couple days is not recoverable - well, not within the realm of my time and capacity anyway.

				I am so appreciative of all your effort on our behalf. Perhaps the time has come to do a benefit for Astorians and raise the money to support a full blown dedicated server. Tell us the cost and turn us loose! If we each donate the cost of a couple of restaurant meals and/or the cost of a couple of beers we might never have to put you through this again!

				Thanks merm!<br /><br />Have you looked at dreamhost.com? I host my personal stuff there and they&#039;re a solid hosting provider. They&#039;ve recently had an issue with billing (last month), so you may see some bad press about that, but that&#039;s the first time in the 4 or 5 years I&#039;ve been with them. I&#039;ve also set up and hosted several of my contracting projects there, including some larger sites.

				I did look into them a bit, but people with mid-sized to larger sites had problems with them so I decided not to use them for now. I need at minimum a &quot;reseller&quot; account, but Dreamhost doesn&#039;t have that anyway. Just shared or dedicated. I might look at them though again if this provider doesn&#039;t work out.
