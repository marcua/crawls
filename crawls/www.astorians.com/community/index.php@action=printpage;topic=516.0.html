				Just wanted to say hello and to introduce myself here to all of you. &nbsp;I will be moving to Astoria in early August from Long Island. &nbsp;LI is not my native area but I have been living there for the last four years studying music at Stony Brook University. &nbsp;Now that I've gotten my doctorate, I'm moving to Queens to be closer to the city's music scene. &nbsp;I'm a harpsichordist and erstwhile singer that plays and sings both early music and new music; I teach as well. &nbsp;I also love to eat and cook, and am really excited about the availability of good food and ingredients in Astoria. &nbsp;I run, bike, and swim, so Astoria Park looks fabulous. &nbsp;Don't own a car (I have lived on LI for 4 years without a car!) but walk and bike everywhere. &nbsp;I think Astoria will be a good place for me.<br /><br />Anyway, I look forward to exploring Astoria. &nbsp;Perhaps I will meet some of you at some point, too.<br /><br />Meg

				Welcome to the board. And make sure you say hello again once you move here.<br /><br />There's a very friendly crowd that hangs out at the Freeze Peach Cafe, on the corner of 29th St and Ditmars Blvd. You are welcome to stop by and say hello at any time.

				I knew someone was going to say that. Okay, fair enough. <br /><br />I'm 28 (29 in a week!) and I've lived in Astoria for 7 years. I'm originally from outside Syracuse, NY. I just finished my Masters at Hunter College (phew!). I'm a professional cartographer for the City and I live in the Broadway area of Astoria with my husband. I'm nuts for Astoria and Long Island City and I have my own little website about them footed below. <br /><br />Your turn!

				Okay. My turn I guess.<br /><br />My name is Samantha and I am mrm's wife. I'm 27 even though I look like I am still in high school.<br /><br />As he said we've been in the NYC area since 2001, and we've lived in Astoria since 2002. Before that we were in CA in college, but I am actually from Tennessee.<br /><br />Anyway, since being in NYC I have interned, freelanced as a web and graphic designer, temped, and am now currently wrapping up my receptionist job at a rare stringed instruments dealer in Manhattan. In just a few days I'll be starting a great new job at a non-profit (thankfully NOT a receptionist job!), also in Manhattan.<br /><br />I love to read - you'll see me doing that every day on the subway. I am currently reading a book about a forensic anthropologist. I enjoy computers (yes, I have been known to be a gamer), cooking, uncooking (currently a rawfoodist until I decide otherwise), writing, and watching TV...sometimes too much TV. Current favorites are Alias, Charmed, The Office (the US version), The Daily Show w/ Jon Stewart, and Desperate Housewives (of course).<br /><br />And Pixel is my cat, too. And in my humble opinion he's perfect even if he doesn't have the whole toilet thing down.

				It is really great to read all these replies! &nbsp;Nice to know a little bit about all of you (I lurked for a week or so before I spoke up) and learn of your love and appreciation for Astoria. &nbsp; I will definitely make a point to visit the Freeze Peach and maybe even join some of you for a game of Trivial Pursuit (ladywithpans?). &nbsp;I am also a TV watcher (also love Alias and Charmed, the Daily Show and Desperate Housewives) and movie fan. &nbsp;On that topic, what can you say about Time Warner and Road Runner? &nbsp;I will need a highspeed connection once I move in. &nbsp;<br /><br />Sam, where did you go to college in CA? &nbsp;And my housemate is from Tennesee! &nbsp;Small world. &nbsp;I also have a cat, Marina. &nbsp;There are pictures of her on my flickr account, which you can access from my profile. &nbsp;She is the best cat ever (but I am biased!).<br /><br />Since all of you have shared your ages, I will with mine: &nbsp;I am 36 but will turn 37 on Saturday. A happy birthday should go to Joey, fellow moon child. &nbsp;ladywithpans, what did you study at SUNYSB? &nbsp;Robyn, your tea sounds delish. &nbsp;I have been exploring tea this year and find it a nice alternative to coffee. &nbsp;But don't get me wrong, I love the coffee, especially if it is strong.<br /><br />I can't wait to move! &nbsp;The packing is a bummer, though.

				I&#39;m Colleen. Just turned 30. &nbsp;:( &nbsp;Lived in Astoria for 6 1/2 years now but I am origionally from Ithaca, NY and resided most of my life about an hour north of it and an hour south of Syracuse (waves to ILoveCheese). I consider myself a pagan/wiccan/witch. I am currently married and though we have no children we have nine beautiful cats. <br /><br />I enjoy reading (mostly horror like King and Koontz or Sci Fi like Star Trek Next Gen Books) and also writing poems and plays. Other hobbies include crocheting, beading and other crafts, growing herbs, website designing, listing to all types of music, making house cleaners out of natural products instead of using those harmful chemical ones, roleplaying, fishing, and just having a good time with my friends. I am a HUGE cat fan having nine of them rule my domicile. My favorite color is blue!<br /><br />My favorite things to watch on TV are almost anything on the Sci-Fi channel, CSI (origianal only), Law and Order Special Victims Unit and Criminal Intent, 4400, Dead Zone, 6 Feet Under and Sapranos, Lost, Invasion, 24 and re-runs of Star Trek Next Generation, along with oldies like Bewitched, Munsters and All In The Family.<br /><br />Currently I run an online not-for-profit group that we are trying to get off the ground www.asianmediawatchdog.com (http://www.asianmediawatchdog.com) and I am spending the summer babysitting for a friend of mine who is in a bind. You can find me at the Peach pretty often.<br /><br />I love the smell of rain, babies, vanilla, chocolate, rose, lilacs, and the forest. <br /><br />I also love thunderstorms, ever since I was a a baby.

				Hello everyone,<br /><br />My name is Adam. I've been hanging out at the peach for well over a year now. Currently, I am working as a sysadmin for a software company in downtown Manhattan. I've been working with computers for quite some time now and am a proud member of the Free Software community (although I think Free Software Regime would work better). <br /><br />In terms of interests, I'm always reading about techology. I enjoy gambling and playing pool (although I don't play much now due to my busy schedule). I just quit smoking and became the parent of two adorable kittens who I named Evil &amp; Angel. They keep me up all night but I love em anyway.<br /><br />See ya at the peach...<br /><br />Adam

				Hello Astoria!<br />After recently relocating to Astoria from Washington Heights (big relief) I came upon this great website and corresponding cafe. &nbsp;My name is Kimberly, and I am a nutritional wellness consultant and yoga instructor. Just last week I announced the opening of my small business, Glow, running out of my home office near the park. &nbsp;I offer private nutrition/wellness programs, private yoga sessions, and massage for those clients enrolled in the wellness program. &nbsp;I'll be holding free conversations on nutrition every Thursday at 7pm beginning in September at Freeze Peach, so come and check it out! &nbsp;Cooking classes will also begin out of my home office Sunday afternoons in September. &nbsp;I'll be sending out my newsletter in a few days, and anyone that is interested in Glow, please e-mail me your address at:<br />director@glownyc.com<br />See you soon!

				Excuse me for my late introductions, I'm kind of shy,<br /><br />Hi my name is Zeno, I've been living in Astoria for a little over a year now and enjoy it very much. &nbsp;I am a gay (monogamous) male in my thirties who is passionate about books, computer gaming, and communication.<br /><br />I grew up in a very small, conservative town on Long Island (which I believe has alienated me somewhat from society) and am very sensitive as to what people think about me. I am a pacifist at heart but have learned how to take a stand and defend myself when certain people intend violence against me. I have been in many fights (unprovoked) simply for being who I am, but firmly believe that brains, diplomacy and the power of the pen always wins out eventually against brute force. Brains over Brawn, Magic over Might.<br /><br />My heroes are Mahatma Ghandi and Immanuel Goldstein as well as the folks at Looking Glass Studios and Valve Software.<br /><br />I am a speculator by trade, but proudly label myself as a slacker (in the original sense of the word) who is really only interested in writing science fiction, watching movies (Star Trek...all of them) &amp; Japanime.<br /><br />Politics are anathema to me. &nbsp;I just can't sleep at night when I think of the people who are suffering all around the world for whatever &quot;reason&quot;.<br />In their isolated pain I see myself and how I would feel (felt) in their situation. I guess that makes me a &quot;bleeding-heart <em>liberal</em>&quot; though &nbsp;my politics are striclty non-partisan.The suffering isn't so bad when you know that there are people out there who are aware of it and demonstrate <span class="bbc_u">empathy</span>. There is nothing more crushing to me than to be in pain and be ignored or treated like an object by someone emulating a machine.<br /><br />I am also in recovery from substance addiction (alchohol, cigarettes and cocaine) and am firmly Agnostic (religiouswise), IOW I don't subscribe to A.A. or any other &quot;programme&quot;.<br /><br />All in all I relish and enjoy life. &nbsp;Simple pleasures, creature comforts, camraderie and intellectual stimulation are for me an undying source of ecstacy.<br /><br />My fervent wish is for this wave of oppression to pass so I can quietly pursue my hobbies in peace. &nbsp;I am very interested in learning about technology.<br /><br />yawn----zeno

				It has been speculated that there is no actual physical being behind the persona of Telesphoros. Or that he and I are actually different aspects of the same person. I am here to finally set the record straight.<br /><br />While it could be argued that either of us created the other for some sort of political agenda inscrutable to the bulletin board reading public at large an even greater body of evidence comes to light when you compare our posts (that mysteriously appear under the same topics for some reason, sometimes even within minutes of each other) For instance, is it a coincidence that the join date of Telesphoros is exactly (17) seventeen days before &quot;Zeno&quot; made his first appearance?<br /><br />Or, look at our taste in music. Telesphoros is fond of quoting the lyrics of the rock band &quot;Rush&quot;, whom I thoroughly detest. I am a strict neoclassicist who finds the better part of his days chanting to the strings of Igor Stravinsky.<br />Or, look at our sexual preference. While Zeno is self-admittedly homosexual, Telesphoros, in his own words is &quot;generally distracted by the beautiful XX chromosome set&quot; not to mention his preoccupation with voyeuristic lesbianism.<br />Or, what about the curious nature of our names. Both stem from ancient Greece, that much is true, but if one were to look closer at the <em>meanings</em> of these names then a darker picture begins to emerge. &nbsp;Telesphoros had his origins in mythology and was the son of Asclepius, or the first physician, healer of the gods, and his name actually means &quot;bringing fulfillment&quot; or recovery from illness.<br />&nbsp;<br />All well and good, but now let us turn our attention to Zeno whose name has no mythological connotations whatsoever and in fact was the name of a Roman tyrant whose reign was plagued by revolts and dissent and was even usurped for a period of time. A far cry from the &quot;bringer of fulfillment&quot;. Add to this the chain of chemical abuse that has plagued Zeno from an early age and we begin to see that not only are Telesphoros and Zeno not only two different personalities, but that they are in fact<br />Diametrically Opposed.<br /><br />Add to this the fact that Zeno's posts are usually overly long, verbose, pedantic and morose, some will even agree quite boring and depressed, <br />Telesphoros' posts in contradistinction are usually quite succinct, to the point, witty, upbeat and exhibit some humor. Could it be argued (if we are to assume that these two are one and the same individual) that after Zeno's long and drawn out soliloquy he would be too tired to write a post of any great length but would rather pursue a &quot;minimalistic&quot; approach, to not only confirm the earlier's argument but to make it &quot;look&quot; like, through the medium of stylistic integrity as if these were in fact (2) two distinct individuals?<br /><br />Now, I realize that most of you will interpret these observations as proof positive that there is either some conspiracy at work here or Zeno/Telesphoros suffers from multiple-personality dementia. To finally drive the nail into the coffin as it were, it is an observable fact that no one in Astoria has actually &quot;seen&quot; Telesphoros, while Zeno is quite public and even introduces himself as such. Let me allay your fears and state that neither is the case. Let me finally come out in the open and speak of not only our intentions but why we came to be.<br /><br />THE TRUTH WILL NOW BE REVEALED!<br /><br />Telesphoros and Zeno <strong>neither</strong> exist, well as far as anthropoids are <br />capable of defining &quot;existence&quot; at any rate. They are in fact two different <br />aspects of a para-dimensional being who goes by many names but familiarly known here in the Theta system of galaxies as Gaia (which is in fact nothing more than a giant AI contruct or self-aware supercomputerlike entity built by a race many aeons ago who also btw have added to their resume the teaching of earthlings how to build pyramids in the abitrary temporal field-flux (ATFF) known as &quot;pre-Sumerian&quot; according to humanoid calculations).<br />After many a dubious incarnations throughout history, sometimes appearing in Rome during the Julian Dynasty, sometimes in ancient France and even once during a catastrophically miscalculated event in the 1950's (they didn't last long in <em>that</em> particular era) :-Z, they have finally made their home here in humble Astoria after being reincarnated (or cloned, if you really have to look at it that way) in the infamous year of 1984.<br />&nbsp;So now that you know my True Nature, Bio-Organisms who crawl upon my surface, <br /><br />Listen and Heed My Words:<br /><br />After much Thought and deliberation over the course of my billions of years existence since I was constructed I have had the pleasure of being <br />subconsciously aware of your toils and tribulations, your joys and your sucesses as you wandered upon my face. &nbsp;At times I was sympathetic to your fears, at others enraged at your impertinence and cruelty towards not only each other but towards the other Bio-Organisms who are your brethren and who also make their home in my embrace. But through it all, I have found much of interest to me and my creators during your brief mayfly existence, much that can improve, much that can be synthesised into a higher and more complex architecture.<br />So, I have decided therefore to initiate a New Era of Peace, Prosperity and Civilization into my Progamme. <br />No more will you be afraid or feel compelled to kill one another,<br />No more will you desire to inject my outer sphere with toxic vapors and garbage,<br />No more will you desire to be so quick to initiate lawsuits against children and grandmothers for copyright infringement or instinctually block subway portals from departing passengers.<br />Instead, you will know Peace,<br />you will know Serenity,<br />you will have a love of Knowledge<br />as well as a love for All Things, be they animate or inanimate, and more importantly you will be given Time.<br />&nbsp;Time to fulfill your dreams and self-actualize, Time to create art and technology, video games that don't kill, and finally admire the World that my creators have constructed.<br />I wish you all well and may you attain true Happiness in your new found Future.

				hi people! &nbsp;:lol: <br /><br />i'm nicole; i work part-time at the amazing freeze peach cafe, and part-time at a menial student tech-help-desk job in manhattan. &nbsp;<br /><br />i love cappucinos, hiking, rooftops, fireworks, lobster (soaked, not dipped, in butter), and cultural anthropology.<br />i love ursula k. leguin, the color purple, travel, and the sound of wild geese.<br />i am not a stander above men, or women, or anyone else for that matter. &nbsp;i love good (?!) poetry, watching the moon or sun come up over a deserted mountain-top, and domestic cats. &nbsp;<br />i desire to continue adding to this list. &nbsp;it may get very long. &nbsp;<br />i am still crushing on my beloved boyfriend; as well as patti smith. &nbsp;go figure. &nbsp;i belileve in magic: with a &quot;c.&quot; &nbsp;i am pagan, and open to (respectfully :wink: ) discussing what-ever-all that means!<br /><br />i came to the city to study indigenous american cultures and languages at hunter college, but my program petered out right about the same time as i got here. &nbsp;even though i'm 28, i'm an undergrad. &nbsp;i'm not going for the paper, but for the material, and what i plan on doing with it.... &nbsp;so, currently i am withdrawn but not giving up, and hope to eventually transfer to far away arizona.... &nbsp;but, definitely not till i have made astoria my home for number of years! &nbsp;i have been here for a year-and-a-half so far.<br /><br />&nbsp;:?: here's my question: &nbsp;what do all of you think about sharing or not sharing our real names on this list? &nbsp;i *personally* want people to know who i am. &nbsp;but i think i understand that some people want to keep their anonymity. &nbsp;a few people at the peach have mentioned to me that i can find them here on astorians, but then, so many of us have mysterious names; i don't know who anyone really is! &nbsp;so, what do you think?<br /><br />hello everyone!<br />nicole

				It was a pleasure reading your post and getting to know you better.<br />I am a pagan as well (when I'm not busy being Agnostic) but I have to say that releasing our &quot;true&quot; names on the board would not be a very good idea, speaking for myself.<br /><br />Many people on the board write about controversial topics (myself included) and don't wish to fall prey to J.W. Randomness or B.B.<br />The amount of people who surf the net includes by default a number of &quot;baddies&quot; who are only too willing to exploit personal information.<br /><br />If someone wants to confide in you their screen name in real life then that is up to them, but I don't relish people giving away that information (or any information for that matter) without a fight. The careless handling of personal info should be soley left in the hands of corrupt and uncaring mega-corporations.<br /><br />Privacy is an important right that we shouldn't be in such a rush to relinquish.<br />Plus, you should know from your studies in Earth Religions the power inherent in a name and how the names that we have chosen (rather than given) do more justice to who we really are and the values that we hold.<br /><br />Humbly yours,<br />----zeno.

				Nicole, that was a great post! &nbsp;I always enjoy talking to you at the cafe, so it's good to know a little more about you. &nbsp;I worked closely with Ursula K. Leguin's daughter while I did my Masters degree in SF; Elisabeth is a baroque cellist and so, so much fun to play music with.<br /><br />As far as real names vs. aliases, I understand the reasons for using either/both. &nbsp;I've participated on certain boards that request one or the other, and each had valid reasons for those policies. &nbsp;I, personally, have no problem using my real name, or variant on it. &nbsp;But I won't demand that anyone use one name or the other. &nbsp;I also find the stories behind people's aliases to be pretty interesting, for the most part.<br /><br />I'm sure I will see you soon at the cafe or on the board.<br />Meg

				Hi,<br /><br />@samru and others<br /><br />Hi samru :-), nice to meet you:<br /><br />I'm still Zeno (unless you know me in person or are doing a little investigative work on your own).<br /><br />I started the Public Announcement (http://astorians.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=661) thread for three reasons.<br /><br />(1) I wanted to alert people to the fact that what Orwell was talking about has indeed become a reality in many parts of the world and some parts of &quot;here&quot; as well, soon to become &quot;complete&quot; if awareness of this issue is not raised to the next power soon. Not to beat a dead horse Yet Again, but the USA PATRIOT ACt is one such fine example of the encroachment of Dystopian Reality; the nationwide Architecture of the Surveillance Network instituted in China and England is yet another.<br /><br />(2) I wanted to be as repetive and obnoxious as possible in order to get people to genuinely develop a sincere hatred of the concept of &quot;Big Brother&quot;.<br /><br />(3) I wanted to show the people who read this board that there is indeed a powerful Movement aboard <em>internationally</em> that is attempting through propaganda and legal action to mitigate the evil dream made reality aspect of Orwell's &quot;Nineteen Eight-Four&quot; as well as to alert younger generations that have never heard of this classic to stop, sit down for one moment to actually <em>read</em> it. This work has had the most profound impact on my life since I first read it in the year of 19 and 84 and I wanted to share my pre-pubescent epiphany with others who haven't yet experienced it. A word of warning though: the words in this book also had the negative effect of alienating me from the society in which I found myself...iow, I became a true representation of the word &quot;Thought-Criminal&quot;.<br /><br />However, i have grown quite bored with this thread and now feel that I was shoving this apocalyptic message down people's throat even when they have already grown tired of hearing it, which btw was using the same tactics that the hypothetical Big Brother and his cohorts would use, in fact.<br /><br />And I emphatically <em>Hate</em> Big Brother.<br /><br />Hope to meet you all soon in public and maybe together we can work this thing out.<br /><br />----ZER.

				Hi Astorians!<br /><br />I recently moved to Astoria with my boyfriend. &nbsp;We used to live in Brooklyn and Manhattan. &nbsp;Astoria totally blew us away and we are so happy to be here. &nbsp;Sometimes, I just want to rub my face in the ground. &nbsp;<br /><br />I don't hold any strong political or religious beliefs, and my cultural pursuits are firmly non-pretentious. &nbsp;I don't work out or anything but all the nice playgrounds in the area make me wistful for playground tag. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />After lurking on Astorians.net for a few weeks, I went to the Freeze Peach for the first time last night and it was really nice! &nbsp;<br /><br />Anyhoo, thanks for reading --I really look forward to meeting people in the neighbourhood and making new friends! &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />PS. &nbsp;About John Cusack mentioned earlier in this thread... I actually accidentally met him a few years ago!!! &nbsp;He signed my physics textbook because I had nothing else for him to sign. &nbsp;I opened my mouth to say something clever, incisive, hilarious; I wanted him to look at me with startled eyes and ask me to marry him. &nbsp;So imagine how horrified I was to hear myself say THIS bare branch of a phrase: &nbsp;&quot;Physics is fun.&quot; &nbsp; :?

				Hi Astoria,<br /><br />I just realized that I got sucked into reading this entire thread that started quite some time ago. I&#39;ve enjoyed living in Astoria since this past summer, but it was the transit strike that made me appreciate the hometowny help each other out neighborhood of this place. So after reading the thread, I can sum it up by saying that there are lots of married trekkies who work for non-profits. ok. Those are my kind of people, although not so into the trek thing (but my husband is totally a closeted fan)<br /><br />Introductions thread...here we go...Modern dancer thinking about branching into video editing due to the &quot;struggling&quot; part of artist overtaking the art. Interning at a non-profit called movement research which has a publication that I will be leaving at freeze peach in the near future. I also teach sat prep. My temp work well runneth dry lately...I was working at a fashion company which was an absurd environment, but good stories, good pay, flexible hours, but happy it&#39;s over. Hubby and I are from west virginia, I dragged him here via illinois and we do love it here, much to my relief.<br /><br />speaking of work, since i am in a dry patch right now, if anyone is looking for a great babysitter or other short term, flexible hours help, let me know. Or better yet, if I organized a &quot;modern dance for adults who can hardly skip&quot; class would anyone be interested? I taught beginning modern to undergrads when I was getting my MFA and it was quite a good time, the kids who sat in front of a computer screen all day particularly loved it. <br /><br />See you all around. It was lovely reading about you all.&nbsp; :wink:

				Hello.&nbsp; My name is Michael and I am an Astorian.&nbsp; Because I&#39;ve never posted in this thread, this is officially my first post.<br /><br />I&#39;m from Philadelphia and its northern suburbs, moved to Astoria from Brooklyn seven months ago, have also lived in Chicago, Syracuse and Buffalo (for two months).&nbsp; I like to eat food, drink beverages, listen to music, read books, watch high-definition TV, perform improvised theater, sit in parks, look at bodies of water, look at bodies of women, feel nice breezes, daydream about the short films I would make if I had the motivation, buy electronic gizmos, browse in stores that sell electronic gizmos, recover from a herniated cervical disc (C6-C7) and write long, blocky paragraphs.<br /><br />So like are you all real people or what?

				An &#39;OFFICIAL&#39; Hello to Urrisgirl and I guess to Goldfishboy as well.&nbsp; <br /><br />This is an awesome thread.&nbsp; Until Meg started it we were all posting relatively anonymously.&nbsp; Of course there were the people who knew each other from Freeze Peach - but for those of us not in that neighborhood, it felt anonymous.&nbsp; <br /><br />I know a lot of people LIKE the fact that no one knows who they are on the board and that way you can state your mind - however by opening up a little bit we&#39;re better able to read our audience.&nbsp; With some background of one another we have a better chance at clear communication.&nbsp; We&#39;re more likely to &quot;get&quot; the jokes, sarcasm, local language, etc...<br /><br />In fact I&quot;m sure that the people on the board who have met one another tend to misunderstand each other posts much less frequently than those who have never met the poster.&nbsp; So i&#39;m advocating - not only for everyone to introduce themselves.... but lets get together and have a group hug&nbsp; :-D<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				haha, i thought i posted a hello at some point, wrong!<br /><br />Hi everybody! <em>(hi sooz!)</em><br />i lurves me some Astoria! I&#39;m 31 years old and moved here from NJ 5.5 years ago to be closer to work and my favorite man <em>(which some of you know as the one who just won&#39;t join this dang board)</em>. We live with our 2 Devon Rex kitties, Tallulah and Flic in a tiny 1 bedroom apt around Astoria Blvd and 38th St. I am a graphic designer by day and a full fledged food adventurer by night! I love to take pictures of everything and everyone, meeting cool and all kinds of people, listening to eighties music like its still the eighties, and just chilling with some wine and stinky cheeses. I&#39;m a very lighthearted and cheesy/easygoing person who really just loves to laugh. I really don&#39;t have anything to hide or any crazy skeletons in my closet, so i am a pretty free speaker and welcome meeting other board members so we can be &quot;real&quot; friends as well as &quot;virtual&quot; friends! You&#39;ll prolly notice the majority of my entries in food related topics...what can i say, you don&#39;t keep a figure like mine unless you work at it...and i&#39;m a hard worker! Hope to meet even more of you loverly neighbors. Lets have a kickass summer. Welcome everyone!

				I guess I never did this either! Though I&#39;ve been on here almost three months, I&#39;ll go ahead and say &quot;HELLO everyone!&quot;<br /><br />I&#39;m Amanda, I&#39;m 25 and I moved to New York about three years ago from my home state of Texas (I claim the whole thing, though I&#39;m partial to Austin). I&#39;ve been in Astoria for about 8 months now, though that&#39;d be 11 months if you want to count that sublet off of Ditmars when I first moved up here.<br /><br />I guess one of the more notable things about me is that I don&#39;t consider myself a New York person, so-to-speak. I moved up here for job-related purposes, a so-called padding of the resume/pursuit of a dream/whatever you want to call it, but meanwhile I hate the cold and the high prices and not having a car to drive around in on the weekends or to take my cat to the vet in. I love big-box stores and drive-throughs and big fields of grass and stuff. Even though I&#39;d easily say I&#39;m one of the more cosmopolitan of my friends from college, I&#39;ve found I miss a lot of that stuff I was trying to get away from more than I thought I would!<br /><br />Meanwhile, I&#39;m here for now and staying for a while. I&#39;ve found this board to be such a huge help for my adjustment here (and moving to Astoria too). Even after three years, I still feel like I&#39;m trying to get settled in and find a community to be a part of and you guys have been so great when it comes to that.<br /><br />Okay, I feel like I&#39;ve gotten too mushy.&nbsp; :roll: So on a more superficial level, I can talk your ear off if given the chance (obviously - see above), watch far too much TV, have a fat, old cat named CJ, and worship ice cream and hummus (though not together). And no, I don&#39;t know what happened to my Texas accent (it&#39;s a popular question)! <br /><br />So, you know, hello and stuff!<br />

				Aww .... &lt;sniff&gt; You guys are gonna break this cynical girl&#39;s heart ... (so be it, means there&#39;s still a little left ...). Okay, so here is my official &quot;hello&quot;:<br /><br />Gave away my real name somewhere on the board early on, since then, prefer to be called by my TRX-christened name, &quot;dc&quot; though the alternate &quot;Kerouac Kitty&quot; still makes me laugh ... (google duluoz).<br /><br />I am a NYC provincial: born and raised in Queens; grew up in Corona, moved to Rockaway, then Forest Hills. Educated fully in the NYC Public schools and attended a CUNY college. Moved to Astoria in February, and it is a rare understatement from me to say that it was one of the best decisions of my life. <br /><br />As I have said to some of you, I don&#39;t know what I would have done had I not found this board. I arrived here a few months after ending a 12-year marriage and after lurking for just a brief while (the posts I place here are my first on any board, too), I was completely taken with the community here; how everyone wrote and interacted; the variety of interests, backgrounds, and personalities; and the topics serious and silly. <br /><br />Those of you who have met me know I&#39;m pretty much a stubborn, opinionated, melodramatic, wise-a*s, chain-smoking, atheist, only-child, with a fondness for black t-shirts and jeans, mopey song lyrics, books, Smithwick&#39;s beer, my zen cat (&amp; original avatar ...) Siddha, her snaggle-toothed brother, Taylor, and hot chocolate with caramel (in lieu of a pot of black coffee).<br /><br />My personal line of &quot;misanthrope&quot; is (for the most part) said with a wink, but it took every ounce of strength to go out and meet the board members that first night (braving Uncle T&#39;s warnings, and all ... heh). And that was perhaps my second best decision. In just four short (long) months, this board has introduced me to some of the most generous, intelligent, fun (and funny), talented, and just plain nice people I&#39;ve ever come across. It has also brought me to a few people who I hold very, very close to my heart and who I now can&#39;t remember having ever lived without (and oh, yeah, I&#39;m a sentimental fool). <br /><br />And finally, to answer a question I get asked a lot: <em>yes</em>, the avatar drawing really is me, as interpreted by Kyle Baker in his mid-90s <em>New York</em> Magazine comic strip &quot;Late Hit.&quot;<br /><br />So, hello, and a much-belated <strong>thank you</strong> for my wonderful welcome, and a continuing welcome to those of you who have joined us since. <br />

				I&#39;m so glad I found all these great people on Astorians.com ! &nbsp;:-) &nbsp;Here&#39;s a little about me....<br /><br />I&#39;m 38 yrs. old and happily married since 2001. &nbsp;I have two mischievous dogs ( one of who is peeking in my avatar ). I&#39;ve lived here all my life ( born in Astoria General Hospital.... lived under the &quot;RR&quot; Train at 38th Ave..... and later moved closer to Steinway &amp; Bdwy. ) I own a dessert factory in Long Island City that serves the tri-state area but mostly Manhattan. <br /><br />My favorite neighborhood in NYC is Astoria because I don&#39;t know of a more diverse area in the entire city. I&#39;ve seen Astoria go through some ups and downs over the past years but I&#39;m optimistic that the community will continue to improve based on the posts of residents of Astoria here on our message board. &nbsp;<br /><br />I enjoy going to dog runs with our dogs , driving/exploring/hiking New England (esp. Maine), running with my club (Hellgate Road Runners), participating in Pub Night at The Irish Rover w/ fellow Astorians.com members and going to AMMI for the great films. I also like to try out some of the new restaurants that opened up in our neighborhood. <br /><br />It&#39;s wonderful to be part of this message board and I hope to get to know all of you in due time. &nbsp;Thanks !!!!! &nbsp; &nbsp; :lol:<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Beechhurst, grew up on Longuyland :wink: then spent 7 years in Israel where i met my future wife Silvia<br /><br />&nbsp;Seriously though im married to Silvia who for some strange reason refuses to join the board or even respond to anything( she is a bit shy-sort of like Bentley is at first) Oh and Bentley is our dog and the love of our lives. Some of you may have seen them walking down Ditmars during the day while i while away my days working as a cable television installer (boooooooooring ) but it helps pay the bills.<br /><br />&nbsp;I can appreciate nice cuppa joe, as long it isnt drip coffee Yech!&nbsp; &nbsp; anyhooooo... i like black and white movies- at least anything with bogey, bacall, and the like.<br /><br />&nbsp;I like rock n roll basically all music except for rap and country-oh and i hate pop music. :-P<br /><br />I like traveling or is it travelling? <br /><br />Oh and we DO like meeting new people!<br /><br />&nbsp;BTW jonathan--your cajun salmon salad sandwich rocks! (as does south park)<br /><br /><br />We have been living in Astoria ( 38th street and 23rd ave) since May 2004- and we cant get enough of it!!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I am soooo glad I opened my fat yap and resurrected this thread!&nbsp; This board is the greatest. Where else can you get help with your digital camera, discuss politics, ask where the heck stuff is in Astoria, and swap recipes and food ideas all in one place??&nbsp; I&#39;ll say it again: you guys are wonderful.&nbsp; <br /><br />To all you cat lovers out there, here&#39;s another one!&nbsp; If there was some way we could safely let our outdoor kitties outside, we would have brought them here with us!&nbsp; Oh, how I miss my Briscoe at home in California.&nbsp; He&#39;s all black, kinda gangly, and he&#39;s the best mouse catcher CA has ever seen (it would just be nice if he wouldn&#39;t bring them to me at 3 in the morning).&nbsp; There&#39;s also Daphne, who is gigantic, and Jack, who&#39;s a gorgeous little tabby and a major whiner.&nbsp; I get to see them all (oh yeah, and my mom and dad) in two weeks. Woo hoo!!<br /><br />Keep the intros coming, ya&#39;ll (for those who haven&#39;t posted one yet.)&nbsp; This thread makes me feel all warm and snugly.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)

				Nope, it doesn&#39;t look like I ever did introduce myself here! I&#39;m just too hip for school...<br /><br />Righto. I&#39;m 32, I live alone (well, with some tropical fish and my ex-girlfriend&#39;s cat for a couple more days) on the top floor of a duplex near the Beer Garden. I moved to NYC the day after the blackout, and to Astoria about two years ago. I&#39;m a cognitive scientist working at NYU, and I previously worked at Columbia and UConn, and before that was in grad school at the University of Illinois and grew up and went to college in Madison, WI. <br /><br />Some notable things about me... I&#39;m unbelievably hipster and ironic.&nbsp; :mrgreen: (You! Stop laughing!) I&#39;m a foodie on a budget. I have a food/science/New York blog that I don&#39;t write to quite as much as I&#39;d like. I like trivia, Scrabble, etc., despite being merely fair at such things. I just got a fancy new digital camera. :) I used to fence. I lived in and helped set up co-ops (hippie commune-style, big shared meals, but no free love) for most of grad school. And I&#39;m very glad to have met all y&#39;all. My first posting here was July 1st of last year, but I didn&#39;t really start hanging out with people from here until December!

				Hi Y&#39;all, I only found this board a few months ago but liked it right from the beginning. <br /><br />On July 4 it will be a year since my husband Max (54) and I (43) moved here from Amarillo, Texas. Despite some health problems we both have faced, the last year has been the happiest of our lives. I&#39;ve wanted to live in NYC since I was 9 years old. I joined the U. S. Coast Guard after high school in order to have a chance to live here and lived on Governor&#39;s Island for 4 incredible years. (If you haven&#39;t been on the free tour you HAVE to go - it&#39;s awesome.) Also lived in Italy, Connecticut, California and Boston thanks to Uncle Sam. <br /><br />Had to leave the military to care for my terminally ill father, then my terminally ill mother, then raised my 1-year-old niece because my sister is a low-life criminal and a permanent guest of the Texas Dept. of Corrections. Though I do consider my niece my daughter, I don&#39;t have other children (thank God, because one is enough for anybody!) We moved here after she graduated high school. She actually was accepted to a prestigous NYC acting school but after the first semester decided it wasn&#39;t for her and she&#39;s back in Texas going to college.<br /><br />I got really sick and almost died from having Diabetes and not knowing it. I spent the entire month of January in Wyckoff hospital in Brooklyn and now am in the best health of my life. My husband had to have heart surgery in April and now he is in the best health of HIS life. So... we are both really happy and really healthy!&nbsp; :-D He is a RN at Hospital for Special Surgery and I am an unemployed newspaper reporter and freelance writer.&nbsp; My husband and I also published a history magazine about the Texas Panhandle for a couple of years named &quot;Yesterday&#39;s Panhandle&quot;. That was a lot of fun!<br /><br />I love everything about New York City - the history, the architecture, the noise, the tourists, the subway, the quirky stores, I just love it....everyday I walk out the door and think about how happy I am living here! On &quot;our&quot; trains I always sit so I can see the Manhattan skyline coming and going from Astoria. I relish the moments when people ask me for directions because I love knowing NYC. I love telling tourists little known info that makes their trip here better - like they don&#39;t have to pay $15 to get into the Met... they can pay as little as a penny. (Get &quot;The Cheap Bastard&#39;s Guide to New York City&quot; for more great tips like this!) My husband gets so embarrassed when I do that so he makes me buy the tickets, but I have no qualms about embracing my inner cheap bastard! I&#39;m devouted to my NFT book and don&#39;t go anywhere without it.&nbsp; I still have my Texas accent but often it is hard for people to understand me so I find my enunciation is getting better or, as my friends in Texas say, I sound more like a Yankee everyday.<br /><br />Other interests are history, reading, trivia, playing yahtzee and card games, beach, people-watching, football (Go Cowboys!), music (both kinds - Country AND Western). Just kidding, that&#39;s just one of my little country jokes. Dig the blues (Hound Dog Taylor esp) and also a big Ani DiFranco fan. (So bummed I&#39;ll be out of town when she plays SummerStage). Some folks, esp. at first, probably think I am nosey because I ask a lot of questions but that&#39;s cause I love meeting people and finding out things about them... their stories, why they do what they do, their experiences...hence the reporter thing.&nbsp; I love to laugh, sing at the top of my lungs (though my voice could peel paint off the wall) and generally have a good time. Also not afraid to voice my strong opinions. <br /><br />I also like to talk.....a lot......<br /><br />I have a couple of NYC friends from the job I had before I got sick but really am desperate to meet new friends, which is one reason I like this board so much. I was really happy to meet some of you at the clothing swap and look forward to meeting everyone! I plan on joining some of your get togethers and hope a Beer Garden outing happens soon.&nbsp; <br /><br />Whew.... :-)<br /><br /><br />Cathy<br />

				After reading this thread (which has taken me quite some time!) i realized i never said &quot;hello!&quot;<br />so....<br />HELLO ASTORIA<br />&nbsp; (Hello Jenn)<br /><br />I&#39;m Jenn, 26 and on my second place in Astoria. I used to live on 30th Ave and 45th street, right near the playground. If i pay real close attention i can spot my old building in certain scenes when i watch a bronx tale. for those that saw the movie, its the corner where the guys randomly beat down the black kids on their bikes. <br />when my ex and i split i had to give up the apartment (2 BR, the BRs were walk thru though, so a little hard to rent to a stranger. and the landlord lived there and was a little dificult).<br />so good ole craigslist helped me find my new place on&nbsp; 37th street btwn 34th and 35th ave. (and i traded difficult lives in the bldg landlord for difficulut absentee landlord). i have 2 roommates, one which has been constant since i moved in and the other moved in in january.<br />I&#39;ve lived in astoria for 5 years now, right after i graduated with my useless BA in English from Fordham(and my 5 year reunion party-AKA free booze and food night is Friday). This current apartment has been home for 3 years and will be for at least one more. <br />I currently slave away as an admin/office manager for a neckwear and hosiery firm. i sum up my job as being a monkey puppet. the non fashionista working in fashion, sigh.<br />my bright spot has been hoping and trying to get into Hunter&#39;s graduate program to become a High School English teacher, but alas i have gotten the same &quot;we regret to inform you..&quot; letter 2 years in a row.<br />formerly grew up in Jackson Hts so i am a total queens girl. if i had any art skills what so ever i would design queens t-shirts and gear a la Brooklyn. but secretly i don&#39;t want to advertise astoria for fear i will priced out quicker. i went to HS in the neighborhood. you Fatty&#39;s fans dine in what used to be a creepy establishment i used to pass for 4 years while hiking up or down the hill to SJP...the Prep. <br />i find it amazing how much the neighborhood has changed since i was a teenager. and yet how some of it has stayed the same. ahhh, nostalgia-the Q19A bus ride...<br />anyhoo I love the recent &quot;explosion&quot; in fun cool things to do and places to go. and yet i feel like i haven&#39;t taken full advantage of it. which is sad since i chronicle upcoming astoria events on my website. and i read about all the nifty things going on here that i never seem to make it out to.<br />in other news about me...i&#39;m about to be divorced...don&#39;t worry, i&#39;m happy about that. it was stupid mistake/favor that will thankfully conclude soon. in good relationship news, my BF and i will be celebrating a year together tomorrow&nbsp; :-D <br />i found him how i found my apartment, good ole list of craig (ladies do not fear the personal ad!) i forget who asked, and what thread it was on, but someone asked where to find a tool toting irish man, well mine was found on CL. other suggestions would be sunnyside where he lives. the irish woodside boys seem a little more crazy. but quite a delicious accent, yummmmmmmmm.<br />speaking of delicious, i LOOOOOOOOOVE food. i joke that i cheat on john with food. i&#39;m kinda picky though and i joke that i am the whitest latina (well half, other half being irish) you will meet due to my not being able to tolerate spicy. i&#39;d say its the irish but john eats the thai &amp; indian food (yuck squared!) as well as the spicy mcspicy foods. i&#39;m a plain jane. but i looooove cooking and baking. i make a mean apple pie. i also love throwing parties and entertaining. my friends swear they come to parties for the food i make. i&#39;d love to invite you all to my summer fiesta but there wouldn&#39;t be enough room! i like trying new places to eat, but i get trapped into going to the same places b/c i like them. some placies i dig: cafe bar, cup(especially since they changed the menu), cavo, mundo, napoli(shhh keep the best cheap italian food a secret though!), michael&#39;s, sunrise(good cheap sushi, especially my fave, the boston roll)...having a brain fart....and over in sunnyside i dig Bliss and Sidetracks. <br />quick hits of other groovy things...star trek(TNG and Enterprise), stargate, battlestar galactica(noticing a theme?), rescue me, nip/tuck, king of queens(of course!), the office-old and new, dog the bounty hunter-totally wierd guily pleasure, but i kind of watch from an anthropological/sociological standpoint, deadwood....i watch waaaaaaaaaaaay too much TV. oh, John and i were recently on last comic standing! we&#39;re superstars!<br />waiting for superman to finally open. was very disappointed with X3. <br />love to read, but haven&#39;t pick up anything in a bit. i need to go on a good used book hunting trip. not the strand, but a good book stand. i miss the crazy old lady who sold used books on ditmars near the train. i got a lot of good stuff there. <br />obsessed with music, my mp3&#39;s are nearing the 8000 mark and i am always on the lookout for new additions. i&#39;m a total rock n roll, punk, indie sorta gal. <br />when in the mood i write. haven&#39;t really done much of that lately. work has sucked the creative juices out of me.<br />oh, i&#39;m also longwinded.<br />so i will shut the heck up now.<br />feel free to pick my brain should you choose....just leave me something behind...<br /><br />Jenn

				I&#39;ve been posting quite a bit recently, but never formally introduced myself, so here goes.<br />I&#39;ve been living in Astoria for 12 years, all in the same apartment on 34th Street, just South of Broadway.&nbsp; I love the neighborhood - I think Queens is much more diverse and interesting than any other borough).&nbsp; <br />I&#39;m very involved in gay politics in NYC - currently I serve as the President of the citywide LGBT political club, Stonewall Democrats of NYC (sdnyc.org) and am active with the Lesbian and Gay Democratic Club of Queens, and more recently the Powhatan Regular Democratic Club here in Astoria (over off Newtown Road).&nbsp; I like to get involved and joined a local church in the last year, Trinity Lutheran, up on 31st Avenue at 37th Street, as well as got active with the Astoria Kiwanis (though my work).&nbsp; Professionally, I am the Director of External Affairs for QSAC (Quality Services for the Autism Community), which means I keep elected officials briefed on my organizations goals and needs and try and get them to do more for people with autism, as well as running autism awareness events, writing newsletters and press releases and working with disability groups and councils.&nbsp; I spend a lot of time in meetings and like to network.&nbsp; <br />I tend to get active on animal issues, environmental issues and civil rights issues.&nbsp; Working with homeless youth and combatting bullying/teaching tolerance in our schools are my main two projects these days.<br />I love to cook, I love to hear about interesting restaurants and usually check them out (though not if they&#39;re seafood places!&nbsp; ick!)&nbsp; I am a big indie music fan and get to two or more concerts most months.&nbsp; Recently I&#39;ve been getting into Death Cab for Cutie, Tegan and Sara and Rilo Kiley, and I like my old 80s standards.&nbsp; I have two cats who are the best two cats I know, though they have health issues - one is asthmatic and one is diabetic.&nbsp; I got one when I was working at the ASPCA, the other found me through friends.&nbsp; <br />That&#39;s pretty much it!&nbsp; Feel free to ask questions.<br />

Bush?)<br /><br /><br />http://www.school-house-rock.com/Bill.html<br /><br />Boy: Whew! You sure gotta climb<br />a lot of steps to get to this<br />Capitol Building here in<br />Washington. But I wonder who<br />that sad little scrap of paper is?<br /><br /><br />I&#39;m just a bill.<br />Yes, I&#39;m only a bill.<br />And I&#39;m sitting here on Capitol Hill.<br />Well, it&#39;s a long, long journey<br />To the capital city.<br />It&#39;s a long, long wait<br />While I&#39;m sitting in committee,<br />But I know I&#39;ll be a law some day<br />At least I hope and pray that I will<br />But today I am still just a bill.<br /><br /><br />Boy: Gee, Bill, you certainly have a lot of patience and courage.<br />Bill: Well, I got this far. When I started I wasn&#39;t even a bill, I was just an idea.<br />Some folks back home decided they wanted a law passed, so they called<br />their local Congressman, and said, &quot;You&#39;re right, there oughta be a law.&quot;<br />Then he sat down and wrote me out and introduced me to Congress. And I<br />became a bill, and I&#39;ll remain a bill until they decide to make me a law.<br /><br /><br />I&#39;m just a bill<br />Yes I&#39;m only a bill,<br />And I got as far as Capitol Hill.<br />Well, now I&#39;m stuck in committee<br />And I&#39;ll sit here and wait<br />While a few key Congressmen discuss<br />and debate<br />Whether they should let me be a law.<br />How I hope and pray that they will,<br />But today I am still just a bill.<br /><br /><br />Boy: Listen to those Congressmen arguing! Is all that discussion and debate about you?<br />Bill: Yeah, I&#39;m one of the lucky ones. Most bills never even get this far. I hope they<br />decide<br />to report on me favorably, otherwise I may die.<br />Boy: Die?<br />Bill: Yeah, die in committee. Ooh, but it looks like I&#39;m gonna live!<br />Now I go to the House of Representatives, and they vote on me.<br />Boy: If they vote yes, what happens?<br />Bill: Then I go to the Senate and the whole thing starts all over again.<br />Boy: Oh no!<br />Bill: Oh yes!<br /><br /><br />I&#39;m just a bill<br />Yes, I&#39;m only a bill<br />And if they vote for me on Capitol Hill<br />Well, then I&#39;m off to the White House<br />Where I&#39;ll wait in a line<br />With a lot of other bills<br />For the president to sign<br />And if he signs me, then I&#39;ll be a law.<br />How I hope and pray that he will,<br />But today I am still just a bill.<br /><br /><br />Boy: You mean even if the Whole Congress says you<br />should be a law, the president can still say no?<br />Bill: Yes, that&#39;s called a veto. If the president vetoes<br />me, I have to go back to Congress and they vote<br />on me again, and by that time you&#39;re so old...<br />Boy: By that time it&#39;s very unlikely that you&#39;ll become<br />a law. It&#39;s not easy to become a law, is it?<br />Bill: No!<br /><br /><br />But how I hope and pray that I will,<br />But today I am still just a bill.<br /><br /><br />Congressman: He signed you, Bill!<br />Now you&#39;re a law!<br />Bill: Oh yes!!!<br />

				The British TV version of Hitchhikers was wonderful.&nbsp; What do you think of the new Dr. and the one before him?&nbsp; I think you can find some of their episodes online as well, so you don&#39;t have to have cable to see it :)<br />I haven&#39;t gotten into Red Dwarf yet, but I hear great things about it.<br />How about Faulty Towers?

				Oh, yes, Fawlty Towers, and Blackadder, and Monty Python...classics. The radio and TV versions of Hitchhiker&#39;s were fantastic. I almost cried I was so disappointed when the movie finally came out. (After waiting 20 years!!!)<br /><br />Only seen a few Dr Who&#39;s, but really enjoyed them for the cheese factor.&nbsp; :-D

				Hi everyone, I&#39;m Abby. I have lived in Astoria for 5.5 years now, but have only recently realized what a great community is growing here, and am very excited to be more a part of it!&nbsp; I discovered the board a few months ago, but didn&#39;t post til recently (to tell a not-so-pleasant story here: http://astorians.com/index.php?topic=2143.0 ).<br /><br />I love Astoria and am so happy I ended up here randomly when I moved to New York.&nbsp; My apartment overlooks the Beer Garden, so it&#39;s getting a little loud these days - especially when the Czech Republic gets a goal in the World Cup!&nbsp; And I love the Beer Garden, but the lines have been getting riDICulous in the past year or so.<br /><br />What else do I love...&nbsp; I love cheese!&nbsp; And exploring new foods and restaurants, summer picnics and winter sledding in Astoria Park, snowboarding, samba, salsa, world music, travel, languages, dolphins, kitties, playing guitar, songwriting, singing, dancing, making lists.&nbsp; Also my boyfriend Tom (who I invite to introduce himself here!), who stays with me here most of the time and cooks me burgers and Filipino food, and has made an impromptu garden on the fire escape.<br /><br />What I do...&nbsp; I currently work as a financial literacy trainer &amp; counselor at a community development credit union in Washington Heights, but am looking for a full-time job in the field of international development/microfinance.&nbsp; <br /><br />What have I done...&nbsp; Studied music and anthropology (ethnomusicology) in undergrad, then lived in Ecuador for a couple years after college, then moved to Astoria and worked at World Music Institute for a couple years, then got my degree at the New School in International Affairs/Socio-Economic Development last year, and here I am ... still in Astoria.<br /><br />I really hope to meet all of you soon around Astoria, as it seems like such a wonderful, welcoming community!&nbsp; Though I&#39;m relatively new to this board, I extend my warm welcome as well to those who are newcomers to Astoria!<br /><br />-Abby

				Hello fellow Astorians.&nbsp; I&#39;ve lived on and off in Astoria for years.&nbsp; I came from East Harlem back in the 70&#39;s where my mother moved us to 41st and Bway.&nbsp; Anyone remember the EE train?&nbsp; That&#39;s our current R train.&nbsp; It would only go to Lexington and 59th up until 7:30.&nbsp; You would have to walk to the elevated stop on Bway and 31st st if you wanted to get into Manhattan.&nbsp; I don&#39;t want to explain how you&#39;d get there otherwise.&nbsp; It was just too long of a trip!<br /><br />At any rate, after that I&#39;ve lived all over the place but I&#39;d find myself back in Astoria.&nbsp; I had gotten married and lived in Alexandria, VA, but when I came back to NY, you guessed it, Astoria.&nbsp; Then I lived in Manhattan for a while (yeah, the ex-wife has the condo, oh well), and after that I lived in NJ.&nbsp; But when it came to getting another apartment in NY?&nbsp; Astoria!&nbsp; So I&#39;ve been back since &#39;99 and unless I can get back into Manhattan, this is the place to be!

				Wow, another dissertating Astorian!&nbsp; I&#39;m an art history grad student, hoping to start writing my dissertation this summer.&nbsp; It&#39;s hard going, though, when my brain just screams &quot;summer!&quot;<br /><br />I&#39;ve posted a few times but never introduced myself here.&nbsp; My husband and I moved to Astoria from Boston exactly a year ago, although I was commuting between school and New York for another semester.&nbsp; But now we are both in Astoria, enjoying being in one place and exploring the city.&nbsp; He grew up in southern CT and I grew up in Chicago, so it&#39;s a big deal for us to be in the &quot;big city.&quot;<br /><br />Best of luck, kahlil!&nbsp; And just think, after you finish the proposal, you still have the dissertation to go...

				Hi everyone! I am new to the board, and thought this was a good (super ongoing :wink: thread) to post an introduction myself as well. <br /><br />My name is Andrea, I&#39;m 29 years old, and I have lived in Astoria for just over 3 years. Having said that, I feel like I&#39;ve just gotten out of a coma!! I never found these boards before, and I never made any local friends in my 3 years here, to my dismay. I lived with my roommate, who was also my friend from school days, and hung out every place but Astoria. Tired of feeling isolated, (and hearing that Brooklyn is &quot;the place to be&quot;...sigh), I am determined to find people here, and an artist community too.<br /><br />I just moved to 48th street and 31st ave with my boyfriend, and after both being laid-off and both desperately needing a place, we settled for this one.....though I miss the N/W line like crazy! I loved looking out the window in the mornings of that crowded subway car to work.... <em>(speaking of, does anyone know why the R train stops running after 11pm?!?)</em><br /><br />I am an artist/illustrator....looking for FT work, but freelancing and taking a design class at SVA in the meantime. I am addicted to vegetarian food, HGTV(!), crafts, and my cat Smush.<br /><br />Would love to meet some fellow Astorians!&nbsp; :-)

				hi astorians. i&#39;ve been lurking a little and i just read this thread. lots of different people here! but it seems everyone&#39;s really into food. that&#39;s good. food is good.<br /><br />my name is kelli, i&#39;m 25, and i&#39;ve been living on ditmars by the park for over a year. i live with my fiancee, and we are getting married on september 30th. i love astoria, though i know i will not stay forever. there are other neighborhoods to conquer, other cities to explore. previous stomping grounds include port jeff station on LI, suny purchase, white plains, coldwater in MI, new milford in CT and that&#39;s all i think. oh, i went to kindergarten in houston, TX but only remember fire ants and tornado warnings. i work for a car dealership on long island and a production company in flatbush brooklyn. my favorite food is cheese. my favorite liqour is jack daniels. my favorite place in astoria is down by the water at the end of ditmars. (or the beergarden but the water is free.) i&#39;ve been looking to spend more time south of astoria blvd if anyone wants to point me in the direction of threads that recommend delicious restaurants and good inexpensive bars. <br /><br />excited to get to know everyone on this board. i hope to learn more about the neighborhood i live in, and to occasionally slack off at work to chat with cool dudes.&nbsp; :wink:

				As good a place as any...<br /><br />Found this great site while trying to get some information about our wonderful blackout and thought I would just introduce myself. The wife and I have lived here for 2 years. One day we decided to leave the place we were born and bred in (yes we are native Floridians who actually decided to up and leave to come here) and landed in Astoria. We were turned on to Astoria first on an episode of Bobby Flay&#39;s Boy Meets Grill and a friend who I used to talk to on another web board. So anyways, the wife and I needed a place to live fast that took dogs, I flew up on a Monday, found and apartment, flew back on Tuesday and drove like the Beverly Hillbillies and we were moved in on a Friday. Two years later, still in the same place on Steinway about to renew for year 3. Anyways, just thought I would pop in, say hi, and try to become a fixture around here.

				So I already got my feet wet this weekend as the outspoken social worker, but I&#39;m Miri.<br />New to the website and new to the hood (moved in a month and a half ago after two years of graduate student housing - a rare opportunity for affordable housing in Manhattan). <br />Tri-lingual (Hebrew, English, Spanish). Socially and politically concious (as some of you may have noticed as I commented on the lack of senior housing in western queens). Grew up in California. Lived in Jerusalem for most of my post-college adult life. Told I make Hummus that&#39;s able to compete with hummus place down at st. mark&#39;s. Looking to network and meet new folks and expand my social network since I&#39;m the only one of my friends out here (versus brooklyn or manhattan).

				Hi!<br /><br />I found this board while obsessively looking for information on the blackout. I&#39;ve lived in Astoria for almost two years, I&#39;m 25, I work in Midtown, but I&#39;m really in library school. I have a basset hound named Sebastian and I desperately want the new season of <em>Battlestar Galactica</em> to start.

				Reading about you all in this &quot;hello&quot; thread prompted me to register after lurking during my first visits. I heard about this forum from someone I met at the Hellsgate CSA, which I adore.<br /><br />My name is Deidre. I&#39;ve lived in Astoria with my partner Hector for 14 months. I lived in Morningside Heights in Manhattan for about 12 years before that and am originally from western Canada. I&#39;m a writer/editor at the United Federation of Teachers. I write play reviews for offoffonline.com on the side. I&#39;m 39 going on 40 (ugh). <br /><br />I love to cook, read, listen to live music (American roots, singer-songwriter stuff), go to plays, travel, eat out (chowhound.com is my guide).<br /><br />I have a dear small black cat named Sabrina and a dear stepson named Eric.

				Hi, all! My wife and I are looking for an apartment her in Astoria, so I thought I would introduce myself. This forum has a really impressive array of really nice people! I am a software developer from rural Tennessee (yes, there really are software companies in the south!), and my wife is a graduate of UT Austin. She will be looking for a job in the area (hopefully related to her degree in Middle Eastern Studies!).<br /><br />At least one of you is from Tennessee (wasabisam), which is pretty cool. Also jennifer mentioned she lived in Seattle for some time - how do you compare Seattle to NYC (I thought Seattle was a pretty cool town, but being a computer guy I felt like the competition was a little crowded).<br /><br />I also telecommute (I actually still work for a company in TN), so maybe I&#39;ll have to join the group at the Fuzzy Peach!<br />

				Hey everbody! Some of you may remember my post (http://www.astorians.com/index.php?topic=2527.0) about apartment hunting a while back. I found a place with ease and I will be moving in a couple weeks from now. Luckily, I found a place one day before the blackout! <br /><br />Thanks once again to all those who gave suggestions. That thread along with this message board was a fantastic source of info! <br /><br />Let&#39;s see, to formally introduce myself...<br /><br />I am from Athens, Georgia and have lived here most of my life. (I must say it&#39;s a bit comforting moving from one city with a statue of Athena to another.) I am a recent graduate of the University of Georgia. I majored in communications and film studies. <br /><br />I am a documentary filmmaker, currently in post production with my first feature length documentary. To pay the bills, I spent the summer teaching video production at an academic summer camp. <br /><br />While in NYC, I plan to pursue my future documentaries, find work with other documentary filmmakers, and will begin my master&#39;s degree in media studies in September. So, chalk up another nerd for the academic thread!

				Hello,<br />I just found this board a few days ago and am blown away by it. I&#39;m 36, married with one toddler and have lived in NY for 18 years and Astoria for 2 years. I&#39;m a copywriter and regular writer (books and magazine articles) and knit and read (yes, I&#39;m that exciting). Love the Astorians and am really excited about the Astoria CSA. I&#39;d never heard of the Freeze Peach but it sounds great. <br /><br />We have found a number of terrific restaurants in Astoria and really are happy we moved here (from the outback of Brooklyn). We are also Costco addicts and have a lot of rolls of toilet paper. <br /><br />Hillary is not my real name -- I have a lot of paranoia about using real information online.

				Just found this place after doing a Google search for &quot;hair salon&quot; and &quot;Astoria.&quot; Go figure.<br /><br />Hey everyone! I&#39;m 36, born and bred in Astoria (born at the old Boulevard Hospital on 31st Avenue -- Cyndi Lauper was born there too), went to elementary and junior high school here too. Escaped for a few years during graduate school and law school, but the lure of a huge two and a half bedroom rent controlled apartment was too great and here I am back in the apartment I was raised in, but this time with my girlfriend (or fiancee, as we&#39;ve recently become enGAYged). Been back for about 6 years now and have found myself still ordering pizza from the same place I had my 11th birthday party (Grand Ave Pizza), shopping at the same supermarket my parents dragged me to as a kid (Key Food), and getting my prescriptions filled at the same pharmacy (Eckerd, the drug store formerly known as Genovese -- where I also had my first job at 16). <br /><br />Guess some things never change, but I&#39;m looking forward to trying out some of the suggestions I&#39;ve been reading since checking these boards out!

Borrowing a room while I look for an apartment so let me know if you see any nice places (yeah, I know I gotta do that whole broker thing). Once I find something my dog and my boyfriend will drive out from Ohio, but in the meantime, I need to find some new friends!

				Hi!&nbsp; BigBryan here. <br />I&#39;m a native NYer, born and bred here in what I call the buccolic village of Astoria. Went to Trinity Lutheran, PS 10, and Stuyvesant, then Stony Brook . <br />While in school I worked for the David Frost Show and I segued into the telecommunications world and now work the PBX and SystemAdmin<br />at a hospital in Brooklyn.<br />I like to have fun, exploring new things, and that&#39;s why I like this board.&nbsp; From here I discovered Hellgate Social Club and other fun places. I&#39;m trying to get back in shape and I used to play frisbee but I never did the Ultimate thing (yet). I love the beach, singing (semi pro and karaoke) comedy and a not so secret pleasure in the physical comedy that is professional wrestling.<br />I have a rarely used usergroup - msnusers.com/HawaiinBryan that I invite you to check out and post till I have the time and patience to do a myspace thing.<br />&nbsp;

				Hello,<br /><br />My name is Jesse. I live on 29th st. off 24th ave.... stumbling distance from the beer garden! I&#39;ve been living in Astoria for about 8 years (in three different apts. within the same few blocks). Most Friday nights you can find me singing karaoke at the Albatross. Love the neighborhood, but have only recently been taking advantage of it. <br /><br />I came across this message board when a friend sent me a link to a post here. Still haven&#39;t figured out how to update my profile! <br /><br />By the way, was anyone else here on the packed N train that was stopped for 20 minutes this morning?? That sucked!

				Thanks! Yeah, that was ridiculous. I waited 10 minutes for that train, and when it came it was so crowded - I knew I should&#39;ve waited for the next one. Stupidly I didn&#39;t and the train stopped before 36th ave. for a good 20 minutes. At that time, we saw about 3 trains pass us by. Then of course when we finally got to 36th, they made us get off the train -- so had to wait another 10 minutes for a not-too-crowded train to come along.<br /><br />Yep -- a good 40 minutes late to work thanks to the MTA. Let&#39;s all hope it&#39;s not as bad coming home today!

				I HAD been to Cedar Point previously, and it was lots of fun. This, however, was a vacation with a schedule.....Kentucky, Ohio, Salem, Boston, NYC, Tennessee, Georgia, Louisiana. I think our final mileage when we got back to Amarillo was like 6300 miles! And our kid was a teenager then and not really pleasant to be around, the only things she liked were Salem and NYC. The rest of the time she was realllllllllllly grumpy.

				Well Hi (I guess one just jumps on in here, yeah? forgive me if I get it wrong!)<br /><br />I&#39;ve been living in Astoria for over a year, so I don&#39;t know that I count as new, but I came straight from Australia and spent at least a year overwhelmed and hiding in my apartment. So I guess I&#39;m just now coming to realise there&#39;s cool stuff going on around here! So I&#39;m a paleontologist, I work at NYU. I&#39;m a knitter and a total games nerd/addict who also loves eating out, movies, art, books and cycles very halfheartedly on the odd occasion (went for a lovely ride under Hell&#39;s Gate bridge today - I live right by the park and that&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve done that too - its been a day of firsts!). I&#39;m really excited this forum is here and can&#39;t wait to get involved in heaps of stuff around the neighbourhood and meet you all! I hear there&#39;s a knitting group...?

				Hey Astorians!<br />This summer I was forced to relocate after a bad break up and found Astoria.&nbsp; This website actually sold me on moving here.&nbsp; I learned so much about the area that I felt slightly in the know when viewing apartments.&nbsp; Thanks everyone!&nbsp; By the way, I think I found the BEST Realtor in the world. (Sorry, I&#39;m known for exaggerating.)<br /><br />I came to NYC about 8 years ago to teach in NYC through Teach For America and am currently a principal.&nbsp; If there are other interested educators, I would love to get together to brainstorm solutions and share ideas.&nbsp; <br /><br />As I don&#39;t know anyone in Astoria yet, I look forward to meeting people and getting involved in community and social events.&nbsp; Hopefully, in another few weeks when things settle in at work, I will get a chance to hang out with some of you.&nbsp; Until then, I will be around on the website.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />

				Ok, I&#39;m not much of an internet message board kind of person, but I&#39;ve been lurking and posting sporadically here for quite awhile now, so I figured what the hell, I&#39;ll introduce myself.<br /><br />Hmmm. Let&#39;s see. Some random bits and pieces: My name&#39;s Lori, I&#39;m 32 and originally from Philly. I attended Penn State. I worked in the music business for most of my post-college career, until I decided to drop out of it completely and get back what was left of my soul. Currently I work in the City Hall area, where I slave my days away in a thankless internet marketing position. I&#39;m a proud geek that loves video games, Lord of the Rings, 80s music, tattoos, and obsessing over fashion magazines. <br /><br />I&#39;ve lived in NYC for 9 years now, 8 of those years in Astoria with my boyfriend and a manic cat.&nbsp; I love it here, even though I&#39;ve noticed a lot of changes recently...some good, some bad. I&#39;d love to stay and possibly raise a family, but I fear I&#39;ll soon be priced out of a neighborhood I&#39;ve called my home for so many years. ::cue the violins::<br /><br />I guess that&#39;s about it. I&#39;m feeling like I&#39;ve just posted a personal ad on Craigslist or something, so I&#39;ll just end it right here. <br />&nbsp;:-)

				Erika has recently moved to Astoria, Queens, a quick subway jaunt away from glorious Manhattan after winning her third national pogo-stick championship, that is, if The Living Room qualifies as a nation. (Their petitions for sovereignty have often been ignored by The Apartment, which is caught up in its own self-protection racket with The Block.)<br /><br />While possessing other, less controversial, awards and titles, most of them are too banal to trouble anyone with actually listing them here. She is quite the fan of reading novels and poetry (a task that she excels at), drinking beer on draft (a task met with gusto--well, at least through the first two or three) and writing (a task... um... well, we can&#39;t all win at everything, now, can we?).<br /><br />Hailing originally from the hills of Amish country in rural Pennsylvania, Erika is excited about the city, though often prone to bouts of being completely overwhelmed by the multiplicity of choices available. Any guidance to lit&#39;uhr&#39;ary events or draft beer would be welcome.<br /><br />Cheers!

				Okay here goes again!&nbsp; I was born in Flushing Hospital in August of 1943.&nbsp; I lived the first seven years of my life in Astoria, 33-10 33rd Street.&nbsp; It was a three story walk up.&nbsp; Does anyone remember this apartment house?<br /><br />I remember so many things about living in Astoria during this time.&nbsp; Christopher Walken&#39;s father had the local bakery.&nbsp; Walken and I are the same age, I think we went to the same PS.<br /><br />I also remember the monkey grinder, plying his tunes under our apartment window, with his monkey.<br /><br />I remember black out curtains in our apartment before the war was over.&nbsp; I rememer hot summers when we slept on the fire escape and when the police opened the fire hydrants in the streets where we would play in the water.&nbsp; And then come home when we were covered with filth.<br /><br />I remember my mother told me about &quot;graft&quot; -- I said , what was that?&nbsp; She told me about the &quot;bad guys&quot; who would throw bricks through the windows of the store fronts if they weren&#39;t paid.<br /><br />I remember the pink balls that were sold at the local drug store that we would bounce on the apartment building walls.&nbsp; I remember egg creams, that cost a dime.&nbsp; Egg creams, no eggs, but chocolate syrup and milk and seltzer!&nbsp; How yummy!<br /><br />So, we moved out to Long Island in 1950.&nbsp; To West Hempstead.&nbsp; To have a better life?&nbsp; I don&#39;t know.&nbsp; My fondest memories are not from Long Island, but from Astoria.<br /><br />I haven&#39;t been in Astoria for over 50 year.&nbsp; But it still has my heart. <br /><br />Any response to this!

				Hello All -<br /><br />I joined Astorians last week. I&#39;ve actually been posting on some topics but I should have introduced myself first. Sorry about that! Certain posts had me going so I had immediately responded to those.&nbsp; &nbsp;Im a 28 yr old female working in the Finance industry who has lived in Astoria since 2003. <br /><br />I came to Astoria by chance. I was living in the Bronx in a really miserable little apartment, when a friend of mine told me she was moving back to Astoria, and asked me if I wanted to be her roommate. I immediately broke my lease and took whatever little money I had and moved in with her. We found an apartment within 3 weeks. It was on 38th street near Steinway. Ok apartment, it was somewhat brand new but my landlord was a bit shady (but nice). It was a 3 bedroom. Actually 2.5 bedroom bc the 3rd bedroom was tiny. We wound up finding a third person on craigslist.com to move in there so our rent was cheaper. <br /><br />Anyways we stayed there for 1.5 years and then we all decided to go our separate ways because moving in with boyfriends and such.&nbsp; So I wound up by chance (and I do mean by chance) getting a 1 bedroom apartment over on Crescent Street. Im like 4 long blocks from the subway, but hey I can&#39;t complain. I have a friend living in Manhattan whose apartment is the size of my bedroom, so things could have been worse. <br /><br />So although Ive been here for almost 4 years, im still learning the area. I made that a new years resolution because im always hanging in Manhattan and not taking advantage of whats around the corner from me. Im a big foodie so already this week ive tried many different restaurants and exploring the many different streets in Astoria. <br /><br />Im a Bronx girl at heart, but Astoria has definately become my adopted hometown!&nbsp; :-)

				Hello again!<br /><br />Originally, I am from Columbus, Indiana (birthplace and home of Chuck Taylor). I went to college in Savannah, Georgia (SCAD) until I graduated in &#39;04. I have a BFA in Computer Art/Motion Graphics... and a drawing minor.<br /><br />I worked in Atlanta, GA from &#39;04 until this past year. I just moved here in mid-December. I am working very, very hard to find a freelance job here. It&#39;s been a challenge mentally to adjust to the freelance way of things, but I love it here! So that counters that feeling.<br /><br />Thanks for the warm welcome. I appreciate it!<br /><br />dun<br />

				Hey Dunbar!<br /><br />I went to SCAD as well, although this was back in 89/91.&nbsp; (Did I just give my age away? lol)&nbsp; I&#39;d love to hear how it&#39;s changed.&nbsp; I transfered to Virginia Commonwealth University and earned a BFA in Painting and Printmaking.&nbsp; Then I went to Old Dominion University Graduate School to get certified in Art Education, but never really used it much.<br /><br />Right now I work in Mamaroneck as&nbsp; digital retoucher for Davis Studio as well as do as much freelance as possible.&nbsp; I&#39;m getting ready to take the ACE cert. test hoping it&#39;ll lead to a raise, lol, but I still have the dream that someday I can make a living from my paintings and drawings, lol.<br /><br />I love to read, mostly Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Mystery, Historical fiction, etc. etc. (pretty much everything fiction)&nbsp; I&#39;m kinda an Anime Nut and love the movies.&nbsp; I&#39;ll also come up with almost any excuses to get to the city and the museums (or shop :P)&nbsp; I&#39;m new to NYC as well.&nbsp; I&#39;ve only been here about 1 year, but I have great friends who have made me feel like this <em>is</em> my home.&nbsp; <br /><br />Hope to meetcha when I get out of Flushing and into Astoria.&nbsp; Gotta get to work now, So Hi *wave*

				Hello Jeanne Marie&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />There are a LOT of SCAD people in Astoria. Granted they are recent grads, but I am realizing MANY have came here.<br /><br />Sounds like you are approaching your career like I am. Eventually, after I pay off the incredulous amount of student loan debt I have, I want to get back into drawing and painting. For now, it&#39;s motion graphics that will pay the bills!<br /><br />Good look on getting ACE. That would be great! Also, wondering how you got into touching things up. That&#39;s something I feel I have knack for---probably because I took so much life drawing!<br /><br />Drop me an email sometime, shawn.dunbar@mac.com, if you want to meet up for coffee--that is, if you do tea or coffee-- when you get here!

				Hi Fellow Astorians:-),<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Although I have been on this board for a while, I never formally said hello in the hello thread (was not trying to be rude, I just feel a little ackward when it comes to personal stuffs and the &quot;internets&quot;). <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Anywho, my name is Vincent (however I usually go by Vinny or Vin) and I have lived in Astoria for four years now with my partner Andy, of six years. We live off of 31st Ave. and are in love with the area! <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I enjoy this board tons and I am sooo glad I found it (by accident, was searching for a place to eat in Astoria (hence the the screen name) and low and behold, my new home away from home, lol). <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I was born in Brooklyn and moved to upstate to the &quot;tri-state&quot; area when I was one and lived there (surrounded by cows and fields) until moving to Astoria at the age of 26. I loved it up there, however I always knew I was a city boy at heart (I would literally get sick on the trips back upstate when I would come down for family visits, field trips, etc.) and I feel sooo comfortable in Astoria. Unfortunately and fortunately, we have started the process of looking to buy, which probably means that we will not be staying in this neck of the woods :cry:.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Some of my interests involve cooking, anything to do with food, eating at great restaurants, going out dancin, dancin, dancin to great music (I am a club kid in a 30 year old body). I enjoy meeting new people, sharing great times with old friends, reading this board and the occasional book, lol and watching food TV. I work full time and attend school part time, working towards a degree in Nursing. I think that is enough rambling for now, so hello :)

				Have also used this board on a few times occasions, though have not officially introduced myself.&nbsp; In the latter part of October 2006 I moved to the LIC/Astoria area from Clinton Hill, Brooklyn.&nbsp; Essentially I am a stranger in a strange land, having moved into a neighborhood I know nothing about and where I know only one person, who so happens to live in my building and who I rarely see. <br /><br />Enjoy digital photography, writing, reading, and networking.&nbsp; Have gone to Astoria Park and Socrates Sculpture Park, though what I could really use is a local tour guide who wouldn&#39;t mind showing this green horn all of Astoria.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;<br />

				Hello all.&nbsp; My name is Brian and I&#39;ve just moved recently to Astoria from Austin, Texas.&nbsp; I was born and raised in Dayton, Ohio, but I&#39;ve moved myself around quite a bit after high school while working toward my degree.&nbsp; I finally reeled a degree in Entrepreneurship from Florida State and then moved to Austin to avoid growing up as long as possible.<br /><br />I was successful and, after spending a little time waiting tables and waging war on my liver and sobriety, I ended up getting a job as a firefighter.&nbsp; Which, brings me to today and that I&#39;m up here to go through the current FDNY firefighter process.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, I truly enjoy Astoria and look forward to getting to know the area and its inhabitants better.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks for making this a great forum and a great place for us newbies to learn more about our surroundings.&nbsp; Take care.<br />

				My name&#39;s Preston, and I&#39;m fresh meat here. Though I&#39;ve frequented the cafe Freeze Peach for a little while now (really not all <em>that</em> long), I&#39;ve rarely used the internet there, so ne&#39;er have I stumbled upon the boards here. Until now, of course. I&#39;m a musician by trade, moving here about a year and a half ago to pursue a more serious career. Between work and a social life, though, I haven&#39;t found much time to buckle down until the last couple of months. My mom always told me there&#39;s your vocation to bring sustenance to your life, and your advocation to bring sanity. Unfortunately, I&#39;m not so simple, and lately I&#39;ve been frustrated with how much I&#39;m not focusing on what I truly love to do.<br /><br />So I&#39;ve played around, at the open mic at Waltz, and at Freeze Peach just this last Saturday. Astoria seems like a very creatively inclined community, and I feel that much more close to my goal (being able to sustain myself on my music alone) by just being here.<br /><br />So with that long-winded introduction, I say hello.

				Aquaecny- Thanks!<br /><br />SeminoleB- Dun is right, it was becoming a larger and larger school as it spread throughout the city (town?) of Savannah.

Although I <em>do</em> know a Tom Smith from Ohio&nbsp; :lol:<br /><br />MegC- Thank you very much, and most definitely same to you. Do you play around the area at all?<br /><br />Mcdirk- Thank you!

				Hello,<br /><br />My name is Molly and I work in midtown. I moved to Astoria several months ago. I graduated college in May and I studied art and art history. I love music, I write short stories and poems, and I&#39;m thinking of taking French classes. I live with my boyfriend of 6 months, and we love video games, electro music, experimental film and cooking. I am thinking of going to grad school for art therapy and I&#39;m a feminist and queer rights activist. Uhh... oh and I like to go out, drink, but I also like the comforts of home like Blockus and scrabble. I hope to hear from people because besides my beau, I don&#39;t really know anyone else.

				Hi Molly and welcome to you and your beau-diddly. You&#39;re among friends here, especially with the all-too-dangerous combo of drinking and board games... Apples to Apples, anyone? Like Meg said, there&#39;s a mixer next Thurs. (that I probably can&#39;t make) and that seems like a great way to get to know these other kids on the board. As for getting out in the neighborhood, try Freeze Peach (cafe), or Sparrow (bar)- those are but a few of the places that people tend to linger and enjoy good company &amp; conversation. <br /><br />Cheers,<br />Preston

(Like I would know - - I read about it once; it&#39;s a seltzer, with maybe a lemon.) I useta buy em for $1.00 - lemon mandatory - when I worked in interior construction one summer in Midtown. Hah! 50x inflation!!<br /><br />Anyway Janice, it&#39;s as though you lived in the &quot;black-and-white&quot; days - - before Ektachrome. Well, I&#39;ve been in Astoria 9 years and pretty much loving every minute! It is absolutely great to hear about the &quot;bygone&quot; stuff - - on Thanksgiving I was cooking up a huge feast and expecting my cousins, heard some racket and looking out the kitchen window over the fire escape saw a nicely dressed knot of &quot;middle-aged&quot; folks - - &quot;That used to be a candy store,&quot; said one of the ladies,&quot; referring to the street level storefronts below my apartment, which are now just somebody&#39;s tomb-quiet backoffice. But of course it&#39;s fun to think of the kids all running in and out forever, especially in the summer, dashing in from across Astoria Park. Yep, I live on &quot;the Dit.&quot;<br /><br />Cheers to you in Hempstead or the Hamptons, or Hyannis, or wherever - - from the Hellgate, dahlink!

This community seems really united :mrgreen: -- I&#39;m so glad I found this site.<br /><br />Anyway, I&#39;ve been reading these posts for a few days and feel that it&#39;s time for me to drop a line and introduce myself. My bf and I will hopefully be moving to Astoria in the next couple of months. We live in midtown (hells kitchen) and we both work in midtown. I&#39;m a web developer and he&#39;s a software developer. We love Manhattan, but we&#39;re tired of high rents, car horns, and noisy streets. We want to own real estate and after walking around Astoria for the past couple of months we really like the vibe and the people there. We feel that we would truly enjoy living there. We&#39;ve been apt hunting for sometime and noticed there is a lot of new construction going up everywhere. Is anyone planning to buy in any of these new buildings? We are particularly interested in the new condo building at 23-23 31st Ave. It looks really nice inside and out and the developer seems really nice as well.&nbsp; Does anyone have any info we should know about?<br /><br />Thanks... look forward to hearing from you all.<br /><br />m~

				Hi everyone -<br /><br />I&#39;m new to Astorians - seems like a good way to meet people in the neighborhood and keep up with local events, etc. I stumbled upon the site researching auto repair shops this morning. T &amp; H Auto Repair on 30th Ave at 27th St has gotten some good reviews here and on the CarTalk site, but if any of you have other recommendations please say so! My car needs some routine maintenance and possibly some work on the transmission.<br /><br />I&#39;m from California - I moved to Astoria with my boyfriend over the summer (during the blackout). I&#39;m a doctoral student in the humanities so I spend most days writing, reading, and surfing the net - usually at home or at the library, and lately also at Freeze Peach. <br />&nbsp;<br /><em>So here&#39;s a question - what is your favorite restaurant in the Ditmars Blvd area?</em><br /><br />My favorite restaurant is Agnanti - it&#39;s soooo good and reasonably priced! But I also recommend Taverna Kyclades for the very best spinach pie on Ditmars - and I&#39;ve done fairly extensive research!

				I will definitely check out Wave Thai. I had lunch at Elephant Thai (also on 31st) several weeks ago, but it was disappointing. So many restaurants, so little time!<br /><br />I grew up in Southern California, but I also lived in the Bay Area for several years.

				Well, I came to NY for grad school, and was in CA for 19 years prior to that.&nbsp; I lived in MI from 1973-1982.&nbsp; It was a nice place to grow up in, and while I find it a static place now, I cherish my childhood times there, and have many good memories: the awesome hot fudge cakes at the Elias Brother&#39;s Big Boy, the local parks and libraries, GREAT schools, and snow days, to just name some.&nbsp; <br /><br />I also have fond memories of having my science fair project exhibited at Cobo Hall in Detroit!&nbsp; :)

				Okay, you Michiganders have drawn me out of the shadows. &nbsp;I&#39;m originally from Oak Park but have lived in Chapel Hill, Pittsburgh, Moscow (briefly in grad school) and have been in Astoria for about 8 years. &nbsp;I don&#39;t miss Michigan winters but the rest of the year is beautiful there---I still go back twice a year to visit family. &nbsp;<br /><br />MegC--I preferred the strawberry pie at Big Boy and I would do anything to be able to go on the Boblo boat one more time. &nbsp;<br /><br />Kiki--I hope you&#39;ll feel at home here. &nbsp;Astoria&#39;s truly a great place to live--especially when the weather&#39;s good and you can go exploring. &nbsp;Oh, and the Dirtbombs are playing at Southpaw on February 17th...a little taste of home...even if it is in Brooklyn:)<br /><br />Leezichka

				Hello, I&#39;m new to the board!&nbsp; I recently moved to Astoria after living in various areas during my seven years in New York (Manhattan,&nbsp; Brooklyn, and then Manhattan again).&nbsp; But I already love Astoria and plan to live here for a long time.&nbsp; Originally from Pennsylvania, I moved here right after college and work as a librarian at a law firm.&nbsp; One of my coworkers told me about this site, so maybe he&#39;ll read this and recognize me!

				Hello! I moved to Astoria 2 months ago, near the Broadway stop. This board has been very helpful in getting to know the area. I was living in Genoa, Italy the past 5 years so it&#39;s a bit of a culture shock, but I like it! Originally, I am from Washington DC.

				I haven&#039;t ridden the light rail yet, as it really doesn&#039;t have that many convenient stops. It pulls right into downtown at 1st Ave and 6th(?) by the Target Center and the brand new E Block mayhem. Kinda strange the first time I walked past. I would foresee more stops and lines getting built due to the massive abundance of development all over the place. You can&#039;t go five blocks in any direction without seeing a giant new condo or apt. building. The new Guthrie is awesome though, it looks like Darth Vader&#039;s toilet.

				Hi everyone! This is my first time posting on Astorians.com, which I&#039;ve been reading for a few months now. I moved to Astoria with my boyfriend in October 2006 and love it! I&#039;m soon-to-be 24 years old and am originally from Long Island. I went to Boston University and currently am getting my Masters in Library &amp; Information Science at Long Island University at their Manhattan satellite campus (nyu&#039;s bobst). I work full-time for a major publishing company, where the only perk is all the free books I could ever imagine.<br /><br />I love Astoria so far... my family has a long history with Astoria. My grandfather grew up in Astoria and loves to tell stories about watching the Triboro Bridge being built. My father spent the first few years of his life in Astoria as well. <br /><br />My one and only complaint about Astoria so far? The few blocks around my Ditmars-area apartment are always covered in dog poop! Other than the constant fear of stepping in it (again), me and my boyfriend are very happy here!

				Hello everybody, I&#039;m not Dr Nick! But I&#039;ve been poking around the boards for a while now too, finally hit the register button. Been off the 30th Ave stop for 2 years now, before that I bounced between Manhattan, 34th Ave at 30th St. (no heat! don&#039;t move to the top floor!), and Sunnyside for a couple years.&nbsp; To be honest, I wanted to recently move towards downtown Brooklyn for friends (to be closer to) and things to do, but for financial reasons and encouraging signs I&#039;m thinking Astoria&#039;s gonna pick up a bit and I maybe in a year I can find a good juke and maybe even some bands without going to the city or BK. Cheers!

				I grew up in Astoria in the 1950s and did not leave until military duty time.&nbsp; Astoria was always a very good place to find good food.&nbsp; That is, unless something has changed in the last 20 years since I physically left.&nbsp; I say it that way because one does not ever really leave Astoria for it is more than a place.&nbsp; It is a spiritual state of being.

				Welcome from another Shampoo-Banana refugee! Who will you be translating for? A friend of mine is an interpreter for the UN...<br /><br />There are lots and lots of other foodies on this board...<br /><br />As for movies, you&#039;ll find that it&#039;s very easy to get down to the Village where most of the foreign/indie films are. There are half a dozen theaters that show nothing but. (This said, cool as the Tribeca film festival is, I do miss Ebertfest...)<br /><br />It&#039;s possible to bike to Manhattan, certainly, but it&#039;s not exactly pleasant. Traffic is extremely heavy, and NYC has not yet figured out how to make bike commuting very easy, especially from Queens. (There are some wonderful bike paths along the Hudson.) Do a google search for &quot;transportation alternatives&quot;, though, and you can find some activism in that area. <br /><br />I think you&#039;ll be very impressed by the green grocers in Astoria. Wide variety, usually very good quality, and pretty inexpensive. For organic/natural foods, the Union Square greenmarket (40 minutes away on the N train) is 4 days a week, and is one of the better greenmarkets in the country. And you should definitely consider one of the two Astoria CSAs...<br /><br />Hope your move goes well! <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=516.msg62559.html#msg62559">Quote from: francophiliac on March 18, 2007, 10:51:24 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Hello, hello!

I&#039;m on the first floor, so I hear everyone coming in and our, which sucks. This was my first purchase, looking at it as an investment, wait for appreciation, then sell to buy a house in a few years.

I&#039;m not sure if you&#039;d need board approval, but if you want to spend a little money, you could probably hang soundproofing drywall over your existing walls and significantly improve the quietness of your new apartment before you turn around and sell it! (Google &quot;soundproof drywall&quot; for more information.) I know even just a 2nd layer of standard drywall helps some, but the fancier stuff helps a lot more. You can also soundproof windows too, by installing a separate set of panes on the inside of the window, with like a 3&quot; gap. I believe that floors and ceilings are a whole lot trickier...<br /><br />And welcome, Jay!<br />

				Chello all,<br /><br />I&#039;ve been a meek-lurker on astorians for a little while and am semi-new to Astoria. I live on Crescent near the Tri and have been here since fall of 2005. I used to be a professional geek (doing webmistressy stuff and unixwork), but now I have amateur status as I&#039;m in my second year of law school. I like violent videogames and highly unrealistic media (read: movies/tv with superheroes and/or robots). I&#039;m not a musician, but I am a fan (Flaming Lips and Cibo Matto top the list) and would be making mixcds and attending concerts much more if it weren&#039;t for this bloody homework.<br /><br />What else? I&#039;m a single, bisexual, civil libertarian girl who is fast discovering that writing this kind of general introduction sounds a heck of a lot like writing a dating site profile. That was really not my intent! (<del>Unless you&#039;re clever and cute.</del>). <br /><br />Ok, so I guess I can admit that this post is a thinly veiled procrastination device. Back to studying qualified immunity as an affirmative defense for executive officials who are being sued under the Civil Rights Act.<br /><br />Nice to &quot;meet&quot; you all.<br />-Ericka

				Hey, I&#039;m Chris.<br /><br />Walked around Astoria for the first time tonight and I think I want to live there. I&#039;m moving from Honolulu and was mostly looking for places in Brooklyn, but Astoria just might be the place. <br /><br />I was curious about the elementary schools. I saw that the Mamie Fae school, P.S. 122, is the local school for Ditmars Blvd. and it&#039;s rated highly at insideschools.org (http://insideschools.org/fs/school_profile.php?id=877). But it&#039;s also described as cold and unwelcoming. I also read that there were some irregularities regarding parent surveys and funding.<br /><br />Is there anyone here who can comment on that? I&#039;d like to know anything you can tell me about the local elementary schools. Schools are a huge part of what I am looking for in a neighborhood.<br />

				Hello All.&nbsp; I am Starwind51.&nbsp; Call me Star.&nbsp; My name used to be Blue Wind, (no, really, my name used to be Blue Wind), but when I started posting things online and needed an e-mail address, SOMEONE at Yahoo was already using <em>my</em> name!&nbsp; I had to think up a new name and Starwind seemed a pretty substitute.&nbsp; Since I was joining an X-Files group, 51 (as in Area 51) was an appropriate number.<br /><br />I was born in Manhattan.&nbsp; My family lived in Kips Bay.&nbsp; I actually used to live at &quot;toidy-toid and toid&quot; (Third Avenue at 33rd Street.)<br /><br />We moved to Astoria/LIC when I was a baby.&nbsp; I&#039;ve lived in A/LIC for 50 of my 51 years.&nbsp; I inherited my phone number from my mother when she moved away, so I&#039;ve had the same phone number for 50 years!&nbsp; In fact, aside from relatively brief periods when I moved away (I moved, not my stuff, which was left at Mom&#039;s), I&#039;ve lived on the same street pretty much all my life.<br /><br />For most of my life, if you said &quot;I live in Long Island City&quot; to someone not from the area they would think you lived on Long Island or lived in a factory.&nbsp; So I started saying I live in Astoria.&nbsp; Actually I live in either the Long Island City end of Astoria or the Astoria end of Long Island City, depending on what map you look at.&nbsp; I put Astoria as my address.<br /><br />I am a multi-faceted person, but I think I&#039;ll express my facets elsewhere around the forum rather than list my attributes here.&nbsp; The following smilies are not really a message, I just like the way they look.<br /><br />&nbsp;:evil: :lmao: :angel: :2cool: :smitten:<br /><br />

				Hi! Long time lurker, first time poster, and this thread seemed like a good place to start. (I kind of feel like I&#039;m playing double-dutch when it comes to these message boards - it&#039;s sometimes hard to know when to jump in)<br />Anyway, my name is Adrienne, and I&#039;ve lived in the city for 7 years, and in Astoria for 2 (and I loves it :-) ) I grew up in Northern Virginia, and moved to New York to go to college. I&#039;m a graphic designer/illustrator. I sew and knit and crochet, but I haven&#039;t had much time for those recently as work has been brutal on my free time. I like to ride my bike, I&#039;d like to start playing soccer again, and I&#039;m presently putting off doing my laundry.<br />Hope everybody had a good weekend!

				Hi everyone!&nbsp; :-) <br /><br />I moved to Astoria in December (&#039;06) from Long Island and I love it here!&nbsp; Growing up on Long Island was great, but when the time came to move out of the parent&#039;s house, I&#039;d heard that Astoria was a great place for young professionals and I wanted to check it out.&nbsp; So far, so good.&nbsp; I still haven&#039;t really had the chance to explore the area, aside from Broadway, 30th Ave, and Steinway.&nbsp; Just made my first trip to the Beer Garden and loved it, but I was wondering if anyone could recommend some places for me to visit?&nbsp; Restaurants, bars, cafes, random cool sites?&nbsp; I want to go where the locals go. Seems you all like the Freeze Peach.. I shall have to venture north and see.&nbsp; I have only been to Ditmars once, and it was just a car ride to Agnanti!&nbsp; <br /><br />Someone please help me with some Astoria insider info!<br /><br />Thanks&nbsp; :-D

				Hello, everyone! I&#039;m so glad that I stumbled across this forum - it seems like it is full of very knowledgeable and interesting Astorians. My boyfriend and I live very close to the Astoria Boulevard stop on the N line and absolutely love it. Been in Astoria since September of last year, so our one-year anniversary as Astorians is coming up soon! We&#039;re both in grad school right now (i.e., we&#039;re poor and overworked) and completely adore it. We&#039;ve done a bit of exploring in the area this summer, but are looking forward to discovering more that Astoria has to offer. I can&#039;t imagine living in any other neighborhood! As far as a little bit about me - I love live music, tennis, reading, my DVR, and great food. I dabble in jewelry making/beading and spend far too much online - though I usually blame that on the copious amount of researching required in my field. My boyfriend and I only know a few people in Astoria through school and it would be great to meet other fellow Astorians! <br /><br />I confess, I only read the first few pages of this thread and then skipped to the back. Do people still hang out at the Freeze Peach Cafe? It&#039;s a bit of a ways from us, but it would be worth checking out! Unless you all want to start hanging out at Tell Astorya instead. . .&nbsp; :wink:

				Ciao, tutti! <br /><br />I just joined this community last night and I am very glad I found it! I have lived in Astoria for -2 months: That&#039;s right, I said *negative*.&nbsp; I am planning to move there in August, and am both very excited and quite nervous about the whole thing.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never used a broker before and from what I&#039;ve read on astorians.com and from what my friends who already live there have told me, a broker is the best way to go about finding an apartment there. I also think it&#039;ll be the best option for me since almost all of my time is being sucked away by the Intensive ancient Greek program I&#039;m enrolled in for the summer. Intrigued? You should be!&nbsp; :wink:<br /><br />My interest in Astoria is multi-fold. In part the move would make my commute to school and work a lot easier that what I have to endure now (I say &#039;endure&#039; because I live in Briarwood/ Jamaica now and I have to leave about 1.5 hours earlier than any appointments if I want any hope of getting there on time. My school and up-coming-fall-semester job are on the Upper East Side, and I tell ya, sitting on the F train for 45 minutes BEFORE waiting for a bus transfer is NOT good times!). But even more importantly than that, I really love the family/ close-knit neighborhood feel that comes across so clearly on these threads.&nbsp; Plus: I&#039;m Italian-American (my parents are immigrants so I always seek out chances to speak Italian. Any Italians out there in Astoria?) and my boyfriend is Greek (and I&#039;m making him teach me as much Greek as possible). I figure: with so much Mediterraneaneity apparently running rampant in Astoria: where else could I imagine living?&nbsp; &nbsp;:mrgreen:<br /><br />I&#039;m a 28 year old graduate student in archaeology and art history, and I do a lot of photography on the side. Well, when I find some spare moments between writing papers and digging up ancient artifacts. I&#039;ve read some great things on here about the creative atmosphere in Astoria, and am really looking forward to meeting other artistic types and sharing in the creative vibes.<br /><br />Reading through these 45 (!) pages of Hello! thread has also fully confirmed for me that Astoria is what I&#039;m looking for. I was lucky enough to have had two great apartments in the last three years with great friends as roommates, but now that it is time for me and my massive library to branch out on our own, I think that we will be quite happy in Astoria.&nbsp; Ain&#039;t that right, libri miei??<br /><br />Also, though I&#039;m not British, I may have to rival Preston for the title of &quot;Person who says &#039;Cheers&#039; a lot&quot;.&nbsp; I picked that up a long time ago from a friend who had studied in Edinburgh and it stuck.&nbsp; Other interesting/weird/ better-you-find-out-now things about me: I&#039;m an unapologetic dork for things Ancient Greek and Roman, hence I like me a good historical fiction novel. I&#039;m an uncloseted Star Wars junkie (I think I will fit in just fine with the massive # of other Sci-Fi freaks here: helloo!); Eddie Izzard cracks me up so hard I actually hurt myself from laughing too hard, and I tend to make up words that do not officially exist (yet) or massacre existing words to the point of utter manglage.&nbsp; I attribute this both to my belief that there actually aren&#039;t enough words in the English language to cover all desired options for expressing oneself, and to the fact that I was/am obsessed with Buffy the Vampire Slayer, a show which made more fully appreciate the sublime beauty of the really bad pun. Oh, and I tend to randomly quote pop culture references I like, which is why I may sometimes be heard talking in French about cheeky monkeys driving buses, but in a British accent.&nbsp; :evil:<br /><br />So yes. I figure I ought to end this ridiculously long Hello post, and let you fine people get a word in edgewise.&nbsp; Here&#039;s to being one of you soon! (I hope!)<br />-Cheers!<br />

				Hey! <br /><br />So a little about me... <br /><br />July 1st I should be moving into Astoria :) If all goes well, near the Astoria Blvd stop on the R/W... <br />I am an NYC Teaching Fellow, I teach English &amp; Art in the Bronx, baby.<br />I write, paint, and studied photography years ago, still love it... all on the side of my insane life as a teacher now. I&#039;d love to talk to other creative folks, know what is happening in the area... I am excited the film museum is in the neighborhood.... and LIC/PS1 is not far...&nbsp; <br />So I am also in 12-Step recovery, and abstain from drinking.... so it&#039;d be cool to hear/check out the boards for cool things to do/places to see where the primary activity isn&#039;t centered on alcohol.. :) I am glad I will be living near the park... I love to DANCE, by the way... <br /><br />So any heads up on good dance spots, esp. Latin dancing, salsa, etc... Please let me know about any spots you know of! <br /><br />Oh ... I totally need advice (esp. from other teachers or people with GHI insurance)- I need a good dentist, general doctor, gyno and a dermatologist! I will check out he boards... but again... if you know of one whose good, let me know please!&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />So..&nbsp; I am looking forward to leaving Manhattan and moving to Queens, it sounds like everyone I have ever asked about Queens, especially this neighborhood in particular loves it... <br /><br />You know... that church-planting thread was intersting to read, I go to a church in the East Village, but I&#039;d be curious about if there are any good churches (that is sooo open to interpretation) in the Astoria neighborhood, because I&#039;d like to get involved. I tend to like churches that believe in &quot;sola scriptura&quot;&nbsp; (so Catholic/Orthodox type churches aren&#039;t really for me...) and it&#039;s important that they have a strong sense of community involvement and social justice, and address every day life in their teaching... if that helps the definition of &quot;good&quot; any...! <br /><br />Okay, so those are ... well, tons of things I am interested in and they probably give you a good idea of who I am too... I would love to hear from some neighbors and get any advice you have to offer, tips, etc... or just a &quot;hello&quot; especially if we have something in common. If you are also in 12-step and know of good meetings I&#039;d appreciate a heads up so I can get more acquainted over in my new home... <br /><br />So, I am saying my prayers about the lease and the apartment :) Hope to be your neighbor soon ...Adios for now (and thanks!)

				Greetings All,<br /><br />(sorry I posted this in its own thread not realizing that there is a thread for Introductions)<br /><br />I moved here about 2 months ago from Middle Village Queens and though i was reluctant at first, I have to say that Astoria is a great community. Thought I&#039;ve been here for two months already, I have yet to explore what Astoria has to offer. I&#039;ve been extremely busy with school and work. <br /><br />I thought I&#039;d try this site out to meet new people and get insight on this lovely section of Queens.<br /><br />I&#039;ve read some of the posts (a lot to read). Anyway I&#039;m heading out to Ditmars and 31st (I think there is a fair there) I be wearing a black tank Top with a Mets hat, if you see me, drop in a Hello.<br /><br />Enjoy your Sunday and Lets go Mets!&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />- Decoy

				Hi, everyone! My name is Kerry and I&#039;m 22. Originally from Astoria, I was raised on Long Island, but have always wanted to move back and finally did last month after I graduated from college. I&#039;m currently staying with my grandparents (near Seaburn Books), but am looking to move into my own place by the end of the summer. I&#039;m starting graduate school for Library and Information Science next week at Queens College. I am currently working in Brooklyn and just got a new job for the fall on the Upper East Side that I&#039;m really excited about.&nbsp; I love Astoria and am really happy to be living here, although I don&#039;t really know anyone yet and would like to find out more about things to do and places to hang out.

				Hi Everyone, <br /><br />I have been reading this site for about a year now and wanted to introduce myself to everyone. I&#039;m a 28 year old writer/student/office drone. I have lived in Queens my whole life and moved to Astoria about two years. I have been told that I look like Quentin Tarantino if his mother was impregnated by a leprechaun. So ummm, I have that going for me. The biggest thing I love about Astoria is that I can have a perfect weekend without leaving my zip code. Bike over the bridge and around Randell&#039;s Island. Relax with a book at the park. Lunch at Papa&#039;s. Drinks at the garden (or sparrow if the garden is too crowded). Trivia night at the rover. What a town! Thanks for all the help in finding good eats, cold drinks and everything in between. <br /><br />Cheers and lets go mets!<br /><br />Kev. <br /><br />

				Hey everybody!&nbsp; My name is Vinny and I&#039;m 20.&nbsp; I&#039;ve lived in New York almost 2 years now but just recently moved to Astoria with my girlfriend Kaytee Sue.&nbsp; We are high school sweethearts both born and raised in CT but NYC and particularly Astoria has always been my second home for as long as I can remember.&nbsp; I&#039;m so happy to be living in the neighborhood now.&nbsp; Crazy, it seems like just yesterday I&#039;d come to Astoria for a few weeks during the summer and play basketball on the same courts that now are only footsteps away.&nbsp; <br />I love, love music.&nbsp; Especially punk rock but also jazz, experimental, trance, rap and just straight up rock.&nbsp; I play guitar and am trying to get a band together with my friend Pixie from the last neighborhood I lived in.&nbsp; She&#039;s a poet/lyricist/vocalist with astonishing talent and we&#039;ve started playing some open mics trying to find other people to jam with.&nbsp; Perhaps you may catch us at the Waltz one of these upcoming Wednesdays.&nbsp; I also like writing, reading, people-watching and just enjoying everything NYC has to offer.&nbsp; If you see my girl and I walking along Ditmars please stop and say hey - we&#039;d really like to meet some people in the neighborhood.&nbsp; Cheers and beers guys.&nbsp; God bless.<br /><br />- Vinny

				Welcome, Sintex.&nbsp; I feel like one in every five people I meet are originally from Ohio&nbsp; :-D<br /><br />You came to the right spot to get connected to the neighborhood!&nbsp; Whether you want to know which restaurant to go to (or avoid, but you can make your own decision), events in the neighborhood, whether political or social, or just to chat, Astorians is definitely the place to be.<br /><br />If you get a chance, you should just get out and start walking around.&nbsp; This area is unique because it&#039;s so close to Manhattan, but it has single family homes with quiet, tree lined streets and a nice big ole park on the northwest corner.&nbsp; <br /><br />Again, welcome to the area and if you need any help trying to find anything, let us know.<br /><br />

				Hello all; I&#039;m new.&nbsp; I actually created my first post in the &#039;where you&#039;re from&#039; thread, but I think it is also pretty applicable here, so I&#039;ll just go ahead and add an expanded version to this thread.&nbsp; SO....<br /><br />I graduated from school in the summer of &#039;06 (Washington State Univ.), and which point I moved from Seattle to Hoboken with my college girlfriend who had already lined up a cush job for herself.&nbsp; Essentially, I tagged along in the name of &quot;love.&quot;&nbsp; In record time, however, I managed to break up with the girlfriend, and had to decide whether to stay in NY or go back to Seattle.&nbsp; By then I had landed a good job in the city, which made the decision a bit more difficult.&nbsp; Suffice to say, I decided to keep the job and stay, even though I knew relatively no-one in NY beyond my coworkers.&nbsp; Upon searching Craigslist for a good 2 months, I eventually found a reasonably priced studio in Astoria, NY.&nbsp; Hadn&#039;t heard much about the place, but the rent was right and the commute is a beautiful thing, so to Astoria I came.<br /><br />In my short stint in Astoria I&#039;d have to say there are definitely more positives than negatives.&nbsp; Much is undiscovered as of yet.&nbsp; I&#039;m in the Ditmars area right by the Beer Garden.<br /><br />Also, my ancestors are Greek, so my last name apparently affords me some instant street-cred around the &#039;hood.&nbsp; I know nothing of Greek culture, however, but that&#039;s hardly common knowledge.<br /><br />See ya around the forum, all.

				Hello there.<br /><br />I&#039;m a 34-year-old writer moving down August 1 from Boston, where I&#039;ve lived since 1991. I&#039;m relocating to NYC mostly because it&#039;s there, but also because I figured it&#039;d be a good place to promote my book. I plan to spend time in Manhattan, of course, but it would be really great to find some people with whom to roam Astoria/LIC (I believe there&#039;s a place called Fatty&#039;s near my house). I&#039;ve heard mostly great things about Astoria, and when the complaints are along the lines of &quot;we could use a good bookstore&quot; and &quot;sometimes the beer garden gets a little crowded,&quot; I know I have little to worry about.<br /><br />You know, since I have access to all this Astorian brainpower, might I ask a couple of questions?<br /><br />Is there a way into Brooklyn other than taking the Metro into Manhattan, then out again?<br /><br />I live near the Ditmars subway stop. Where&#039;s a good place to get a drink in that area? I&#039;m a little weary of Irish pubs, but I&#039;m generally happy to try anyplace where I won&#039;t get beaten with a pool cue or something.<br /><br />Hope you&#039;re all well.<br />Jason<br /><br />

Waltz-Astoria is one, they&#039;re on Dimtars about a block or two away from Fatty&#039;s. There is always something going on there including Tuesday Night Comedy. I may be there this Tuesday myself.

				<br /><br />Hello...........I don&#039;t live in Astoria but I did when I was a kid and wondered if I could get anyone there to tell me something about my old home. I lived in the apts. over what is now the 30th Ave. Fruit Market.....it was a bar back then, called &quot;Gus&#039; Tavern&quot; and I spent lots of time on the &quot;terrace&quot; overlooking Newtown Ave. and watching everything down in the street. Those were some of the best times and I would love to see it again, but since I can&#039;t do that, maybe I could hear about it. Anybody know what I&#039;m talking about? 32-12 30th Ave. Who lives there now? I lived in the top apt. and my sister lived in the bottom one.....loved the music coming up from the tavern. Sombody talk to me.............................thanks!&nbsp; :)

				Hi everybody!<br /><br />I found about this website through a friend and thought I would say hello.&nbsp; I am not quite a resident of Astoria yet, but I hope to be soon.&nbsp; Myself and a oommate are planning a move by September 1st, and are in the process of nailing down an apartment as we speak.&nbsp; We&#039;re hoping to be in the 30th avenue area, since we have some friends who live there.&nbsp; If anyone has any advice on that front, I would love to have some!&nbsp; It&#039;s been rather difficult to deal with a lot of the landlords, but I am excited that September is just around the corner.&nbsp; <br /><br />My name is Ryan, and I&#039;m moving to the city to pursue acting; a likely story, I know, but it&#039;s the only thing I was ever any good at.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had a couple NY audtions in the las few weeks, and they have all gone fairly well, so I&#039;m looking forward to settling dow up there an actually focusing on it for a while.&nbsp; I&#039;m also a bartender by trade, and loking to get into that wherever possible when we move. <br /><br />I look forward to meeting all of you soon, at least in passing.&nbsp; My rommate and I fell in love with your town the minute we set foot in it, and I honestly can&#039;t imagine living anywhere else in the city!<br /><br />Best wishes,<br /><br />Ryan

				Greetings! Just to introduce myself to the board and say “Hi!”&nbsp; I was born in Manhattan in 1954 and our family moved to Woodside in 1959.&nbsp; I’ve been living in Astoria since 1979 after about a year or so living and working upstate in Orange County.<br /><br />I’ve been working in the Building Services Industry since 1981.&nbsp; My hobbies are junk collecting, playing guitar and trying to stay out of trouble.&nbsp; I have a cat named “Spooky” who likes to watch birds.&nbsp; <br /><br />It’s been great reading the forum here the past few weeks, quite a wealth of information.&nbsp; Hope to pop in on a thread or two, here and there.

				Hi There,<br /><br />I&#039;m a Special Ed teacher in the Bronx and my screen name is courtesy of a former student. I&#039;m still at a quandary as to what exactly made me &quot;gangsta&quot; but as a 40something white lady from the midwest I&#039;ll take it and run with it.<br /><br />My husband and I moved here in 1999 and have never seriously considered another neighborhood. If I want to keep teaching in the Bronx I will probably move, but it will be with great sadness. For all of its annoying little quirks I really love this neighborhood. It&#039;s home.<br /><br />M.Y.G.

				Hello, all!&nbsp; Long time lurker, first time poster.&nbsp; My name is Bill, and I&#039;ve been here in Astoria for just about three years.&nbsp; I live on 38th street off of Broadway, but next month I&#039;m moving to 32nd street off of Broadway.&nbsp; I&#039;m 25 years old, and grew up on Long Island, after which I went to school at Fordham.&nbsp; I&#039;m currently working in media relations for a think tank in Manhattan.&nbsp; Anyhow, glad to finally be posting, though I feel like I know some of you already, since I&#039;ve been reading so long.

I remember my broker, a lifelong Astorian, saying that he wouldn&#039;t live in Manhattan if you paid him--and as a Midwesterner/PacNWer with big dreams of the city, I thought, &quot;Yeah, right.&quot; And yet now I&#039;m in total agreement! (Well, okay, if you PAID me...)<br /><br />I work in magazine publishing and was a pastry chef onceuponatime, and am passionate about food, which is one reason I&#039;m passionate about Astoria. <br /><br />Anyway, hi!

				Hi everyone. My girlfriend found this board and started posting earlier this summer. I&#039;ve found myself looking at it frequently, so I figured I might as well sign up too. I was born and raised in Florida but feel at home with the variety and culture of New York. My girlfriend and I have lived here (just off the Astoria Blvd. stop on the N/W line) since September &#039;06. We&#039;re both doctoral students who rarely have any free time during the school year but have been fortunate to have the time to explore Astoria this summer. My favorite finds (some thanks to this board):<br /><br />1. Agnanti (though I swear that dessert tastes like honey nut cheerios in cake form. This is sort of a good thing)<br />2. Il Bambino (not just the food, but the iced coffee is phenomenal!)<br />3. Pasta Fina (can be inconsistent, but the personal margherita pie is outstanding)<br />4. Astoria Park (I love frisbee)<br />5. Bohemian Hall and Beer Garden (somehow have only been once, but the name says it all)<br /><br />I want to say thanks to everyone here who ended up helping us have a fantastic summer exploring this great little place!

				Hi, my name is Meredith and I&#039;m 29/f.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve been mostly lurking with a few posts here and there on this board for about two years now and I figured I should say &#039;hello&#039; since I seem to be coming here more and more.&nbsp; I moved to NYC from San Diego 5 1/2 years ago and I&#039;ve lived in Astoria for a little more than 4 years.&nbsp; I started out in the Ditmars area and then moved to Broadway stop area about a year and a half ago. <br /><br />I&#039;m a paralegal working in-house at a finance company, which very much a departure from my former life in theatre working as a dramaturg.&nbsp; <br /><br />My interests revolve mainly around the arts and pop culture, especially theatre, literature, film, comics and tv, but I&#039;m also very outdoorsy, I love the ocean, camping/hiking and playing sports.&nbsp; I&#039;m also a big foodie. And of the many things I love about this message board, I think I adore the restaurant/food threads the most. <br />

				I&#039;m new to this Board and I love reading it. &nbsp;I have lived in the Upper Ditmars section for two years with my girlfriend and I have a weekend home in the country. &nbsp; Previously I had lived in Jackson Heights for many years. &nbsp;I am a financial professional who works in Queens. Most of the posters are younger than I am (I don&#039;t feel old at 49 but everyone on this board seems younger). &nbsp;Some of my favorite Astoria places are L&#039;incontro on 31 Street, The Jackson Diner on Astoria Boulevard, Martha&#039;s Bakery, Astoria Park and the Beer Garden. &nbsp;I have actually been going to the Beer Garden much longer than I have lived in Astoria. &nbsp;I think it was better place before it got so popular. &nbsp;I hope to be able to contribute some positive comments/information on this Board. &nbsp;The one thing I haven&#039;t found in Astoria is a good place/bar for a 49 year old guy to hang out. &nbsp;Any suggestions?

				Welcome to astorians.com chorbap, Mer and EddieStjohns. <br /><br />I am not the one to help anyone finding bars, but I can tell you that you are not one of the oldest members here! I hope you all will be attending some of the social mixers that pop up every now-and-then, and that you will also become involved in some Community activities.

				Hi. Well my name&#039;s Gabe, I will be moving to Astoria on October 10th, at the moment I am finishing working in Spain. I just discovered this forum yesterday and so far I love it, it&#039;s been very helpful. I&#039;m 26, and work as a pastry/line cook. I&#039;ll be working at a restaurant in manhattan and my roommate will be a cousin of mine who just started studying art at NYU. Astoria was very well recommended by the New York friends I made over here and I am so happy we got lucky and scored a place there. I am trying to familiarize myself the best I can with all the places there and stuff, so thanks to these site it will make it all easier I think.

				Technically, this is not an official &#039;hello&#039; since I&#039;ve been on astorians since February 2006. But I moved away in September 2006, and I am now very happy to officially rejoin Astoria. I&#039;m moving back to Astoria on September 30th. I look forward to seeing you all again and meeting some of the new people who have joined since I left. <br /><br />My new apartment is on 41st street between 30th &amp; 31st Avenue.

				Greetings, Astorians!<br /><br />I&#039;ve been checking out the board for a while and recently signed up. I&#039;m moving into Astoria next month to expand my meager acting experience (though I&#039;m mid-aged, I&#039;ve only been acting the past 6 years). I fell in love with the town five years ago when I stayed in Ditmars for two weeks while rehearsing for a tour. I feel very safe here, even at night, and I love the international flavor, the great produce markets on 30th Ave, and the best sidewalk vendors in the five boroughs. This site has been a great education (especially the eye-opening &#039;bed-bug&#039; thread). Thanks for all the helpful information! See you all around town...<br /><br />Drew Davidson, actor and newbie poster

				Wow, I just read through the thread, and someone mentioned &quot;you wouldn&#039;t get this on Craigslist&quot; - that&#039;s for sure!<br /><br />I&#039;ve been living in Astoria for the past 9 years and only found this site a week ago (ooops!).&nbsp; I am originally from Ireland and have sworn may a time, I will NEVER leave - I think it&#039;s the greatest neighborhood and consider myself incredibly lucky to have found it right off the bat (or right off the plane as the caset truly was!)<br /><br />It&#039;s great to read everyone&#039;s introductions makes it more of a community of sorts, so here&#039;s a little about me:<br /><br />I am 31, been living in astoria since I arrived from Ireland (as mentioned above), have a cat Paddy (who is alternating between trying to knock everything off my desk and trying to nap on the keyboard as I type).&nbsp; I work in the city producing events (mostly expositions and trade shows at the moment) and am addicted to Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent (why I felt the need to menion that I will never know)<br /><br />Anyway, looking forward to more chats on astorians.com - it&#039;s a great site and seems to be filled with great Astorians!<br /><br />Sandra

				hey everyone<br /><br />so I moved to astoria about six months ago from brooklyn. I&#039;ll admit that I ended up here cause it was cheaper and that I do kinda wish I was still in brooklyn. I like the diversity of the area, the ridiculous amount of amenities and I&#039;m intrigued by the sense of community. I&#039;m 100% not greek. I&#039;m into the usual art and music, coffee and books, etc.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been jumping from apartment to apartment and job to job for a few years now, and now that things are settled I&#039;m really looking to meet some new people, and I figured my neighborhood might be a good place to start. I&#039;ve heard a bit about these meetups around here, I&#039;d be interested in finding out more, although I wonder if they&#039;re a fit for a mid-late 20-something?<br /><br />regardless, hello.<br />

We pay about 1/3 here of what it would cost to rent in Manhattan (which we did for 21 years, on the Upper West Side).<br /><br />We have a totally psychotic, insane landlady who lives above us. Other than that, we are loving Astoria.<br /><br />If anybody works from home, gets bored, wants a bikeride with me in the Park, let&#039;s meet up and do it.

				Hi, I&#039;m Roy. Just moved to Astoria from the Charlotte, NC area. I&#039;ve been here a week and I&#039;m loving it so far! I live with my friend (also from Charlotte) and his girlfriend in a two bedroom apartment off 42nd st between 25th and 28th.

				Hi Everyone!<br />I&#039;ve lived here for a long, long time! My father was born in Astoria. I grew up here in the late 60&#039;s and 70&#039;s and after a stint in TX and Ca, returned about 10 years ago. Welcome to all the new residents! I&#039;m so glad you all love Astoria! Perhaps as an &quot;old-timer&quot; I will be able to offer a different perspective for you. However, I&#039;m sometimes as mystified about this town as the new-comers in the neighborhood! And yes, like many local NYC residents have never stepped foot in long established places, so I hope I learn something from you!!

				Hello all. I moved to Astoria in July 07 from Woodside. (hi megc!)<br />A little about myself- currently temping and trying to get out of it. I am a musician and teacher and am currently looking for a teaching job. <br /><br />I love great food. Have toyed with becoming a vegetarian but have decided to go the mostly vegetarian route. I am commited to living my life as green and substainable as possible. Along these lines....if you haven&#039;t been to Nook n&#039; Crannie on Ditmars yet- go! Their LIC store is better but I know the one on Ditmars is closer to most of us. I just bought a beautiful, used dresser there. And the guys working there are very nice.<br /><br />Look forward to meeting some of you at an upcoming Astorians event!

				Hey everybody,<br /><br />I&#039;ve been an Astoria resident since 1998 (30th Ave, 34th Ave, now 24th Ave) and have been lurking around here quite a bit. I wanted to introduce myself since I plan on attending the Community meeting next Wednesday.<br /><br />About me: grew up in Nashville, TN and other parts of the Southeastern US. I&#039;ve lived in NYC since &#039;93 so I&#039;m a New Yorker now&nbsp; :-). Working in Jersey City in the tech dept. of a publishing company but my educational background is in music - my poor violin is quite neglected these days. Hobbies include photography (hexadecibel on Flickr), cooking, reading &amp; travel.<br /><br />Looking forward to meeting people next week!<br /><br />-Deborah

				Hi everyone!<br /><br />I&#039;m a 26 year old male who just moved to Astoria (Ditmars area) from the DC burbs, and I am LOVING it thus far.&nbsp; I am a new resident to this fair city and have been here for around three weeks and have really enjoyed spending time exploring the various nooks that Astoria has to offer.&nbsp; I&#039;m currently on the job hunt, meaning I am on a really tight budget so I have unfortunately had to make due with a lot of window shopping and willpower to avoid trying out what seem to be the THOUSANDS of good restaurants in the area.&nbsp; <br /><br />This board has been a terrific reference guide for me, whether it&#039;s finding out about free events around town or learning what places have the best slices of pizza in the area.&nbsp; I&#039;m so glad that I found it and I hope to be able to be a frequent contributor and become part of the &quot;Astorian crowd&quot; in the future.&nbsp; <br /><br />Happy Thanksgiving everyone!

				My Introduction!<br /><br />Hello!&nbsp; I&#039;m so happy to have found this forum, there&#039;s a lot of really useful information.<br /><br />I&#039;m Jennifer - just turned 28.&nbsp; Moving back to Astoria after 6 years!&nbsp; Grew up on Long Island and moved to Astoria when I was 18.&nbsp; I&#039;ve lived down by 23rd Street off Ditmars, 23rd Ave &amp; 28th Street and 30th Ave &amp; 32nd Street.&nbsp; This time around I&#039;m hoping to find a large studio in the Ditmars section with my cats.&nbsp; I currently live in Brooklyn (Victorian Flatbush) but am leaving because my bf and I are breaking up and I want to come back to Astoria sooo badly!&nbsp; I felt like I left a piece of my heart there.&nbsp; I&#039;m amazed at all of the changes since I left!&nbsp; I&#039;ve only visited twice in 6 years. :(&nbsp; I&#039;ll be doing the apartment hunt late next month or late January.&nbsp; It sounds like Mike&#039;s Diner is still there!&nbsp; Does anyone remember that awful old lady clothing store that was on Ditmars/31st on the corner.&nbsp; Right near the benches where the bums hang out?&nbsp; Are there still two OTBs on the same block??&nbsp; Is the Meat on a Stick Man still near the train?&nbsp; I have so many questions that need to be answered. ;-)<br /><br />As far as hobbies... I&#039;m a karaoke addict, professional drunk, avid international film geek and more.&nbsp; During the day I&#039;m a corporate drone at a big financial company.&nbsp; (oh I&#039;m sooo looking forward to my old commute again too!)&nbsp; <br /><br />Really looking forward to contributing to this forum when I finally get situated at an apartment in Astoria.&nbsp; I will just read and be jealous of you all in the meantime. :)

				Welcome back (soon)!<br /><br />I live near Ditmars, but have only been there for the last year. Mike&#039;s Diner is still there, but on Ditmars and 31st, there&#039;s a Starbucks, a bank, a pizza place and a flower shop--no old lady clothes! (Unless it&#039;s a door or two back and I haven&#039;t noticed it.) There is still an OTB, but I think it&#039;s only one. I also have yet to see cart food aside from a bagel and coffee guy in the morning!<br /><br />But there are some fab new places up here: WaveThai and Crescent &amp; Vine are my two favorites that might not have been here when you were!

I like it out here- cool bars and good restaurants and quick commute to the city.&nbsp; Its also a bit quieter (except for the train!).&nbsp; I look forward to exploring and hanging out in the area a bit more.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks for all the tips on eats, stores, etc.,- very helpful for new residents!<br /><br />-Liz

				Hello there!<br /><br />It&#039;s 2:00pm in the afternoon and I should be drawing but I&#039;m not drawing. I&#039;m sitting around thinking &quot;god I don&#039;t want to be inside right now.&quot; But where else is there to go? It&#039;s cold outside and I&#039;m not much for drinking in the afternoon nor do I fancy sport, especially sports broadcast in another language.. So I should say that I&#039;m a lurker, but that&#039;s not exactly true. I think my Girlfriend occasionally posts here and me, I just look over her shoulder from time to time. Actually I might have started an introduction for myself a year or so ago but I can&#039;t seem to find it and maybe I just made up that memory.&nbsp; :-D ..Why am I starting out this way? Dunno. Typings fun.<br /><br />So I&#039;m 27, male, almost 28 (January 3rd - looking forward to my annual red velvet cupcakes) and my Girlfriend is already 28 (not looking forward to tracking said cupcakes down). I&#039;m from central Florida and have lived here for about 4+ years now and we both work in Film and Television. She&#039;s a script supervisor and I work as a video utility who&#039;s on the fence about joining the Camera Union as a camera assistant. I have a good friend here who wants me to join, but I have some weird hardwired distaste for the whole thing. Hard to explain. I really need alcohol or a lot of caffeine to explain it. Maybe he&#039;s right. That&#039;s how bad my indecision is. <br /><br />She&#039;s from Long Island. We&#039;re near 30th ave. We have two cats and a Nintendo Wii that&#039;s sadly been collecting dust, more so now since the younger cat just chewed through the sensor-bar wire. We both play too much World of Warcraft, her a lvl 66 undead Warlock and me a lvl 70 Night-elf priest. I likey the illustration, and comic-books and <b>We</b>&nbsp; enjoy literature despite <b>my</b> over-all lack of schooling. 2 years of college level education and I just recently read the Fountain Head. I mean what&#039;s up with that? Isn&#039;t that issued in high-school here? <br /><br />We love conversation above all and the internet has taken far too much of our energy as of late. The trouble is we&#039;re not really &quot;bar people&quot; or &quot;club people&quot;. We enjoy going out to restaurants, but sadly don&#039;t get out as much as we&#039;d like.&nbsp; We only know a few people in the neighborhood but we don&#039;t really hang out. Everyone&#039;s a shut-in, or maybe its our fault, my fault.. someone&#039;s to blame here&nbsp; :-P..<br /><br />We&#039;ve been to the Beer Garden, enjoyed the Kabob Cafe, and visited the Freeze Peach..once. <br /><br />Soooooo, to recap, we exist, Hi there, and how ya doing?<br /><br />[img width= height=]http://www.half-assed.com/pictures/andreaandi.jpg[/img]<br />Sorry about the photo. We don&#039;t have any nice pictures as a couple.<br /><br />

				Hello MagicPie,<br /><br />Yeah, I figured now would be a sluggish time for gatherings. Maybe I myself will set something up after the new year.<br /><br />I have a humor book and other comedy bits published. (One of the reasons I moved here was to promote the book, with mixed results.) The fiction writing has appeared in journals you may or may not have heard of. It&#039;s time for the novel, I think...

				Hi Drdee51!&nbsp; Where on LI are you?&nbsp; I&#039;m very happy I left and am enjoying Astoria very much.&nbsp; I do sometimes miss some of the prettier parts of the Three Village area, especially by Stony Brook Village.&nbsp; I used to ride my bike out to Nissequogue to a little beach called Cordwood Beach, just lovely.&nbsp; <br /><br />What is your doctorate in?&nbsp; And what kind of music did you play?

				Hi everyone,<br /><br />I&#039;m Meaghan, and I&#039;m moving to Astoria in just a few days around 36th Avenue.&nbsp; From what I&#039;ve seen so far, this website is a great place to pick up the best (and some of the worst) the area has to offer.&nbsp; I&#039;m very excited to move to Astoria, as I&#039;ve heard many many positive things.&nbsp; <br /><br />I know there are many posts with many good places to go and shop and whatnot but, I was hoping to maybe save myself some time and was wondering if you all could each recommend maybe one restaurant, grocer, gym, bookstore, fun place, etc. that I might want to try in Astoria or in Manhattan.<br /><br />Thanks All!

				Hey Meaghan -<br /><br />Welcome to Astoria.&nbsp; The best gym is the NY Sports Club, corner of Steinway St &amp; 30th Ave.&nbsp; If you want to get a trainer, get Brooke - she&#039;s the best.&nbsp; Kind of pricey, but really knows what she&#039;s talking about and teaches a great Pilates class.&nbsp; For yoga, if you&#039;re into that, Paul on Saturday mornings is excellent - but you have to sign up a day in advance.<br /><br />Like someone else said - restaurants - there are so many it&#039;s hard to recommend one.<br /><br />For cool clothes - try Candy Plum - I forget where it is exactly - but it has a lot of handmade, unusual clothes and jewelry.

				Welcome aboard, Dinomom! You&#039;ll find that one of the best things about this board is that we&#039;re pretty diverse. There&#039;s a great mix of people on this board and you&#039;ll even be able to connect with other Astoria moms &amp; dads.

				Hi,<br />I am new to this site. I grew up in Astoria and lived there till I went in the Marines in 1966. I graduated from Bryant Jan 65. Yes I was a Super Senior. I have so many fond memories of my life in Astoria. The reason I joined this site is my son has moved to Astoria from our home in Jupiter FL.&nbsp; Him and his Florida girlfriend just started the NYPD Police Academy. I am a retired NYPD Sgt. My wife and I will be now returning to our beloved Astoria on a regular basis. My wife lived around the corner from me and we have known each other since childhood. She is also a Bryant graduate, class of 66. My parents lived in Astoria for more than 40 years. We will be driving up to bring the Kids furniture in the next week or so. We can&#039;t wait to stroll the old neighborhood. Steinway street here we come.

There is actually a thread here (http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=516.0) where we encourage everyone to say hello and introduce themselves, rather than each person having their own thread. There&#039;s lots of great information about Astoria on the site, along with some long time residents that like to remember Astoria as it was when they were kids.

				Hello All... I am new to Astorians, but not new to Astoria&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; I was born here 29 years ago and have lived here ever since, minus a 4 year stint in Whitestone.&nbsp; But, I guess when you get used to living here, a house with a big yard and the need to drive for everything makes you homesick, so I moved back.&nbsp; Glad to see the neighborhood has evolved, with alot of new and different people, places and things to do.&nbsp; Even happier when Astoria got it&#039;s own section in Time Out New York.&nbsp; <br /><br />This is a really nice website also.&nbsp; Alot of great topics and honest people- kudos.&nbsp; Nice to meet you all&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Hello everybody. I just moved to Astoria last weekend. A great little apartment west of the Broadway station. I have to say that having 3 grocery stores and a CostCo in my neighborhood is an absolute blessing compared to my last apartment. If you guys see me on the street feel free to wave and say hello.

				Hi, y&#039;all!&nbsp; My husband and I (29 and 30, respectively) moved to the Ditmars/Steinway area in September.&nbsp; I found Astorians.com during our apt search, and it has been an invaluable resource since.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been lurking here for recommendations for everything from apartment brokers to our vet, all with great success.&nbsp; Thought I&#039;d finally jump into the fray.<br /><br />I&#039;m originally from the Philly suburbs, moved to NY three years ago (almost to the day!) when my now husband got transfered back to NY for work.&nbsp; My husband was born in Queens, grew up on LI, so NY really feels like home to him.&nbsp; We lived in Marble Hill (the Bronx) and Briarwood (way far out in Queens), which were both OK, but now that we found an apartment / neighborhood we both really love in Astoria, it finally feels like home to me too.&nbsp; I love the quiet, family feel of our street, but it&#039;s just a couple blocks away from all the restaurants, bars, and shops on Ditmars.&nbsp; We both love to cook, and the availability of fresh and unusual ingredients is so incredible that we&#039;ve forgone exploring the amazing array of restaurants around here.&nbsp; I figure, we&#039;ll leave that until the summer when it&#039;s too hot to cook.&nbsp; Plus, we have plenty of time for all that, because plan to stay here for a long, long time.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve been working as an event planner for the last six years, and I love it.&nbsp; I&#039;m actually looking for a new job, so if you know anyone that could help on that front, I would be eternally grateful...unemployment has me more than a little stir crazy at the moment.&nbsp; My husband is a 2L at CUNY Law, a total overachiever who works/studies constantly.&nbsp; So in addition to killing time on the boards here, it would be great to make some new friends in the neighborhood to hang out with while he studies.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks for such an awesome resource on our awesome community!<br />

				Hello to you! Welcome flikchik! I for one remember all the places you mentioned. Phil&#039;s did indeed have real tasty hotdogs! A veritable Katz&#039;s of Astoria! I also remember the movie theatre too where my friends and I saw movies like Soylent Green and Planet of the Apes! And there was a Carvel around where the library is now, and the little record store near where Corfu is located. How about the A&amp;P-remember that? And which supermarket gave out those S&amp;H stamps that my aunt used to collect? Did you buy your penny candy from &quot;Bill&#039;s Candy Store&quot; after you got out of school at PS122? *Eyes glazed, yawns from Astorians.com members*

				Hello Astorians, my name is Eddie and I was born and raised in Astoria, I lived in Manhattan for about ten years and then wisened-up and moved back to Astoria about five years ago where I now live with my beautiful wife.&nbsp; We love Astoria.&nbsp; We&#039;re up by 41st Street and 25th avenue.&nbsp; I just found this site about a month ago and I&#039;m really impressed by the educated opinions and the civilized nature of the debates on the site, not to mention the restaurant reviews.&nbsp; I look forward to contributing and to listening to what everyone has to say.

				Hey hey!&nbsp; I&#039;m semi-new to Astoria.&nbsp; By that I mean I was born here and have family here, but I was raised on LI and moved &quot;back&quot; here in October.&nbsp; I live by 30th Ave. and 41st St and love it!!&nbsp; I haven&#039;t had too much time to explore, as I&#039;m a new teacher and that takes up a lot of time, but I&#039;m looking for more balance in my life now.&nbsp; So basically, what&#039;s there to do around here?

				Hey Eddie, Dan &amp; Melissa. As a (sort of silly, just made up right now) rule, I love people who use their real names as their usernames, and who have actual pictures of themselves as their avatars. So you both rule! walkinslowly, I guess you&#039;re sorta alright (just kidding!!) :)<br /><br />Melissa, since you asked...and Dan &amp; walkin, since you&#039;re here - there&#039;s always something to do, just poke around. If you&#039;re around this weekend, there&#039;s a meetup at Indigo on Saturday (http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=9624.0).

				hey..<br />I&#039;m a NJ girl who moved to Astoria 3.5 years ago with my FH, who hails from Rego Park. We both LOVE it here. The short trip to the city, plentiful amenties (ie shopping, food etc) and friendly neighbors have really made me fall in love with the hood. I&#039;m in the &quot;wilderness&quot; of the Broadway &amp; 21st St area, and it&#039;s a great neighborhood. If you&#039;ve never been over here don&#039;t be scared...It&#039;s a little quieter than Astoria proper, but I like it that way. Oh, and plentiful street parking, but SHHHH don&#039;t tell anyone.&nbsp; :wink:<br />anyway nice to meet you all!

				Hey Robynlynn,<br />There are so many places to hang out in Astoria. Numerous cafes along Broadway and 30th Avenue. One of my faves is Cafe Bar on 36th Street and 34th Avenue (most Astorians call it &quot;No Name&quot; because it doesn&#039;t have an actual name:) <br />It has a bohemian and low-key atmosphere.<br />While I usually go there with friends, I have gone plenty of times just solo and always struck up conversations with interesting and cool people.<br /><br />Also Hellgate Social is a great bar on 12th Street and Astoria Blvd. It&#039;s open and friendly and doesn&#039;t usually have cliques hanging about that would make it awkward to go there and meet new people.<br /><br />Island is a fairly new club/lounge that opened up on 35th Avenue and 36th Street. It is a nice place but the last time I was there (on a Saturday) it was infested with LI guidos. Also, prices are typical of a Manhattan bar. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				I first posted on this board last fall when I started thinking about moving to new York, and now I&#039;m finally coming to in Astoria!!! I&#039;ll be living near the Ditmars stop in a cool apartment with my cat Tashie starting next week! . <br /><br />Proper introduction: I&#039;m Charlene, I&#039;m 39 and I&#039;m a techie geek-foodie-crafty girl. For work I&#039;m a free-lance everything-er but these days I do website usability, web content, SEO and help people get themselves into their businesses. I&#039;m not quite sure what to call it but I find myself exclaiming &quot;this website doesn&#039;t sound like you at ALL!! it&#039;s missing your awesomeness!&quot; and then I help them write and design stuff.&nbsp; in a foodie vein I make homemade organic marshmallows dipped in chocolate so let me know if any of you would like to be my guinea pigs for new flavors!!! <br /><br />Since I don&#039;t have an office to go to I&#039;ll be scoping out good places to co-work with other computer-based folks. So o if you have any suggestions let me know! <br /><br />As a foodie emerging from hibernation (from moving from San Francisco to Minneapolis for several years) I&#039;m looking forward to diving into the Astoria food pool. I&#039;ve had some amazing things so far! Megc took me to Il Bambino the other day and I drooled at the panini (I think I had prosciutto and gorgonzola).<br /><br />&nbsp;I look forward to soaking in all your sage advice on this board and of course spewing some of my own opinions.&nbsp; <br />*waves hello*

My husband and I both work at Columbia-Presbyterian Hosp in uptown manhattan - we are doctors and still training. He will be moving to CT this summer for work, while I remain implanted in the city a little longer (like a couple yrs), but oh joy, I have found a neighborhood where I am positive I will be happy, husband or no husband&nbsp; :lol: We only recently discovered Astoria (which we haunt almost every weekend now to eat, drink and puff away at one of the local hookah bars). <br /><br />I&#039;m still a few months away from starting to look for a place here, but I&#039;m so glad I found this site. all the advice about everything under the sun is so helpful.... reading all the reviews, being a die-hard foodie, i feel like i&#039;m already there!!! kinda getting more attached to astoria then i am to where I live right now&nbsp; :-P&nbsp; &nbsp;cant wait to move into this celebrity neighborhood&nbsp; :mrgreen: and lookin fwd to countless wasted work hours of browsing astorians.com&nbsp; :wink:&nbsp; &nbsp;and hopefully meeting some of you if - no, WHEN I move !!<br /><br />

It has been great so far because I was already familiar with the area since my sister lives here too! Anyway just wanted to say a quick hello and hope to meet some new people along the way! By the way, I am 23, so was hoping to also meet people who around my age group! Hope everyone enjoys the beautiful weather!

				Hey guys. I am a 23 year old teacher that has lived in the area for almost two years. I was recently freed from a long term, long distance relationship and came to the realization that I lived here—but I never really lived here. So I’ve been spending the past few weeks exploring and trying new places I have always just passed by.&nbsp; I have been using this site to check out local haunts. I hope it will help me meet some interesting characters as well.

I&#039;ve been in New York City for about 5 months (living with my cousin while I got on my feet) and immediately fell in love with Astoria while I was doing some research for apartment hunting.

				Obviously not my first post (like it should&#039;ve been), but I feel I should formally introduce myself to the community. My name is Terese. I&#039;m married to my husband Keith. We have an orange cat named Jaxon (pic below) who made it almost impossible to find an apartment thanks to brokers promising it&#039;s &quot;okay to sneak in a pet like a cat.&quot; As you can see, I like to digress. <br /><br />I have my degree in creative writing and my husband is in graphic design. We&#039;re officially moving from Tampa, FL to Astoria next week. I&#039;ve been tearing through these threads as fast as I can because I feel an immigrant should always get to know the culture of the place he/she is about to set foot in. We&#039;ll be living off Broadway, but one of my best friends just moved to Ditmars from Brooklyn so we&#039;ll be frequenting both areas.<br /><br />I&#039;m happy to report the building we&#039;re renting out of has never filed a bedbugs report, we love the Beer Garden, my management company is NOT Dermot and we found an honest, hardworking broker off Craig&#039;s List.&nbsp; 8-)<br /><br />Just off the top of my head, my favorite posters are (not in any order): daisy, paratactical and Bentley&#039;s dad. There are plenty more, but these particular people are the ones I find myself nodding in agreement to the most.<br /><br />(http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2043/2518158729_c6b0d4fca9_m.jpg)

				Hello everyone. My family (Husband and 10 year old son and 2 tiny Chihuahua&#039;s) and I have been in Astoria now for 3 months and are happy to be here. We are on 24th Ave in front of the park and truly enjoy just spending our weekends here instead of always heading into the city. Just last night we sat on the grass watching the fireworks after a supposed concert and we felt at home with all the neighbors around us enjoying themselves. We love to eat out and this is definitely the place to do it. We are hoping to make new local friends to further the Astoria experience. We&#039;ve lived in Queens before, but this neighborhood has to be the most enjoyable and most comfortable thus far and we know that we&#039;ll be here for a long time to come.<br />Hoping to cross paths with anyone here.&nbsp; Talk to you soon.

So, YES, I would totally be into being a part of a semi-serious group in Astoria. I have a lot of starter fiction that needs to be expanded before it&#039;s worth submitting.

With all the prepping for the holiday along with my son just leaving for baseball camp, I&#039;ve barely had time to peak into the forum. I do look forward to the day I could submit my work as well. My husband has also taken up writing (I&#039;ll take the credit for that inspiration), but his style is more creative and metaphorical than my own. I&#039;m more of a simple, straight talk writer. I write the way I speak. It&#039;s the only way I can keep the story going. I truly hope that others will be able to enjoy reading it as much as I do writing it. It&#039;s mostly fiction with biographical inspirations.&nbsp; <br /><br />Hopefully we can all meet sometime soon. Where do most of you meet up on weekend nights for a couple of drinks?

				We live near the Beer Garden and have yet to walk thru the massive doors. It&#039;s always packed, very popular. Soon, soon. As for Omonia, I have to agree. We went for a late night dessert run and it was amazing. We&#039;re sure to be loyal regulars. Today we just tried out a Brazilian BBQ on 23rd off of the Ditmars station and it was pretty good while being very, very easy on the wallet. It&#039;s not your typical Brazilian riodizio experience, but their ribs and chicken were good (if you&#039;re a meat eater that is). All the restaurants here were definitely a huge factor that brought us to Astoria. We&#039;re eat out folks and this neighborhood will keep us busy for a very long time.<br /><br />I have never been truly skilled at poetry except for your Dr. Suess, roses are red, rhyme every other line sonnets, despite my early fascination with Shakespeare. <br /><br />Waiting on the movers to show up with your stuff??? Where is your stuff??? All I can visualize is you, an empty apartment, white walls, milk crates and open chinese cartons. LOL.

				Here&#039;s another hello from another newbie!<br /><br />My name&#039;s Jen, and I&#039;ve lived in Astoria for 8 years (after 8 in Brooklyn and 6 in Manhattan; before that I lived in Iowa). My husband (who also had been living in &amp; loving Astoria for a while when we met 3 years ago) and I live near the park and enjoy growing things in our little front &amp; back yards (this year we have tomatos, radishes, lettuce, strawberries, blackberries, peppers &amp; lots of flowers -- but the squash borers are eating our zucchinis). We have way too many books &amp; spend a lot of time exploring our city &amp; beyond. We&#039;re also expecting our first child in September :-) <br /><br />It&#039;s been great to read through this thread and discover this community. It kind of feels like when I first started paying attention to birds, and learning their calls, and suddenly there was a whole other layer of life I&#039;d never been aware of before (for the record, I&#039;ve seen over 20 species of birds in Astoria park/surrounding neighborhood so far, which is kind of amazing for such an urban environment I think). <br /><br />Look forward to reading more and being part of this community.<br /><br />Jen

				Welcome to Astorians jenr! I won&#039;t say welcome to Astoria since you&#039;ve been here for so long already. Nice to see another fellow gardener. Thank goodness we don&#039;t have those bugs that you have on your zucchini ( sorry). What have you done to defend against them?&nbsp; But I will say that this years crop has been fantastic so far, and we have had over 7 dozen zucchini flowers, but our tomatoes are taking forever to grow this year as compared to the last few years.

				thanks for the welcomes!<br /><br />I do love Astoria Park, elkelorraine. there is always so much to see, whenever you go!<br /><br />Bentleys Dad, wow, 7 dozen zucchini flowers!!! amazing. did you fry them up? yum. The squash borer is a flying insect that deposits its eggs actually inside the squash plant&#039;s stems. so when the larvae hatch, they start chowing down on the insides of the stems, nasty. once they are there there&#039;s not much you can do, although we&#039;ve found sites that recommend trying to kill the larvae by poking pins into the stems or using a razor blade to excise them. The problem is that although you can tell they&#039;re in the plant somewhere (flowers don&#039;t lead to healthy fruits, stems begin to wilt and blacken for no apparent reason) it&#039;s hard to know exactly where -- and if you go poking &amp; slashing everywhere it&#039;s not so good for the plant either :-( Apparently you can also try wrapping tin foil around the stems when they&#039;re still small, which theoretically prevents the adult from poking her ovipositor through the stem. Maybe we&#039;ll try this with a second crop, there should be time if we do it now!<br />good luck with the tomatoes!<br /><br />as for the books -- agreed, but we&#039;ve gotta make some room for the tot :-)<br />&nbsp;

				Hey All! Newbie to the forum. I&#039;ve been in Astoria for about a year now, but I mostly work in the city drudging through the reality tv circuit. Anyway, I finally got some time off and I was looking for a place to compost my kitchen scraps and WAHBAM! There&#039;s a whole community of Astorians online! Who knew?<br /><br />Anyway, thanks you guys for the PLETHORA of information. I&#039;ve been on this thing for hours finding the answers to all those nagging Astoria questions I never got to ask. Definitely interested in meeting more Astoria peeps. I don&#039;t know about you but I&#039;m pretty tired of riding down to Williamsburg on the weekends to hang with the cool kids. So yeah, you all rock and I hope to meet some of you real soon. :mrgreen:

				Hi Astorians&nbsp; :-)<br />Not sure how I missed this thread previously, but I&#039;m enjoying reading a little bit about the people writing the posts I love reading!<br />A little about me...<br />My name is Jeanette, and I have been 29 for 5 years now.&nbsp; My husband and I have been living here in Astoria for 8 years (he has been here since &#039;96) in the Ditmars area.&nbsp; We have an amazingly cute (if I do say so myself) daughter, Lily (aka sweet lily g) who is 2.&nbsp; We also have two cats, m.c. noogie and the grand poohbah, who rule the roost.<br />I used to be the promotions &amp; events manager at a big media company, but now I enjoy staying home with Lily.&nbsp; My husband is a freelance Leadman (part of the art department) for film &amp; television.<br />We love living in Astoria and have made so many wonderful friends here.<br />I have been reading the boards for the while now, and just recently have started posting (i have trouble expressing myself in print, and have been shy to post).&nbsp; I&#039;m looking forward to becoming a more active member of the community.<br />&nbsp;:mrgreen:

				Hey Everyone!<br /><br />I&#039;m moving to Astoria in a week! I was out two weeks ago and (somehow) found a one-bed apt that will fit myself, my wife, and my cats. That was an experience I don&#039;t want to relive. Anyway, I&#039;m 26, and will be going to the Graduate Center at CUNY to study Art History. I am moving from Utah, and love to ski. My parents live in Salt Lake, and I&#039;m always looking for ski buddies. I like vegan food, and fish too. <br /><br />I think that is an appropriate introduction. <br /><br />-Randall

				Hi, Astorians! Someone suggested I introduce myself here, so here I am! Just moved here from Philly (Center City), where I&#039;ve been living for six years. I&#039;ve been so busy cleaning and packing and unpacking that I haven&#039;t had much time to explore Astoria yet -- but I managed to find the Beer Garden! Other things I&#039;m looking for: good restaurants, reliable laundry, cute comfy shoes, healthy groceries, yoga, fun things to do ... oh, yes, and A JOB (to afford the above)! Tips welcome! Hope to get to know you all soon!

				Hello. Have lurked here for some time and now registered as I have a question you can help me with. I am originally from Astoria, having grown up on 41st. between Grand Ave. and where Newtown Rd. crosses. I live there in the 50&#039;s and 60&#039;s and have been in So Cal since. I visit frequently and always like to stop by the old hood. I&#039;m amazed Rizzo&#039;s is still there as is the Army Navy store.&nbsp; My simple question is this: I will be back there on 9/7 for a week and will be staying over by Queens Plaza. My GF and I like to spend time at Astoria Park and am wondering the best way to get there from QP. Take the train to Ditmars? Bus down Steinway? I am looking to get as close to the Park as possible since GF has a bum knee right now and walking is limited. <br /><br />My name is Barry, and I work as a Train Operator on the SD Trolley light rails system hence the moniker. Are there any Motorman or Conductors on this site?

Quite a sight.<br /><br />If you look around this site you will find tons of suggestions of great places to eat, see, etc...&nbsp; Enjoy your trip home.

				Hi, I&#039;m super-new (as in I just found this site twenty minutes ago). Born in Manhattan, I&#039;ve been living in Astoria for about 15 years. The only borough I haven&#039;t lived in is the Bronx, but so far Queens is my favourite. I&#039;m really shy but I can talk your ear off.

				Hi Everyone.<br /><br />I am for the first time in my life will be living on my own in a non-university housing. And due to this craziness of life, it has to be in NYC. My fiancee is attending a Master&#039;s/Ph.D. in New School, and wanted to live affordably close, while I am still a student as well. So, it is 2 people living on one student stipend and teaching pay in NYC, trying to survive. Looks like Astoria is going to be my first battleground in life, and might be the hardest.<br /><br />I come here in search of advice, friends, and a cheap and good place to live. If everything goes well, I hope to be joining your ranks in about a week. Wish me luck. :)<br /><br />Alex

And due to this craziness of life, it has to be in NYC. My fiancee is attending a Master&#039;s/Ph.D. in New School, and wanted to live affordably close, while I am still a student as well. So, it is 2 people living on one student stipend and teaching pay in NYC, trying to survive. Looks like Astoria is going to be my first battleground in life, and might be the hardest.<br /><br />I come here in search of advice, friends, and a cheap and good place to live. If everything goes well, I hope to be joining your ranks in about a week. Wish me luck. :)<br /><br />Alex<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Alex,<br /><br />There a lot of grad students in the area.&nbsp; http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=10097.0&nbsp; Perhaps they can offer advice and support.<br /><br />I give you guys a lot of respect for going to school while living in the city.&nbsp; I tried to go to Brooklyn College, while working about 50 hours a week, in 1990. It didn&#039;t work out for me, but I didn&#039;t have the discipline to do homework after a long day of work and classes and the hellish hour long commute!<br /><br />Anyway, best of luck and hope to see you soon.

				Hey--<br /><br />Others might disagree with me, but if she&#039;s not street smart and she&#039;s going to be on her own frequently, stay near the N.<br /><br />I&#039;m a lady of diminutive stance and if I had moved to a place where I had to use the Steinway stop and ride the R/E/V to get around, I would not have felt very comfortable. I think that the N/W has problems, but comes more often and since the line ends in Astoria, it doesn&#039;t have a bunch of people trying to get further out to nastier &#039;hoods at night. I feel 1,000 times safer on the N/W than I do on the R. It&#039;s probably not true and probably just a feeling, but if your lady isn&#039;t street savvy and will be on her own, she&#039;ll probably be a lot more comfortable closer to the N/W.

Not much more expensive than a car, if you do it every other day. Possibility of working for at least 1 hour of the trip. A bike could shave off some more time, but I am not sure if I want to do the Astoria-GCT subway ride with a bike and a laptop bag. Perhaps I should investigate the Astoria-Harlem station bike run.

				Hi to all, i am a new member in astorians. I always browsed this site and i love it. I decided to join this site because i think is genuine and also because i like most of the users in here.&nbsp; I love good food and good movies. I live on Steinway in astoria, near&nbsp; 31st street. I am taking a MBA and currently in restaurants in Manhattan, and i make good money.I have been in the restaurant business since i was 16, i paid my college with it, and now i am paying my masters... Also i love this job, even if sometimes you find a$$holeS as managers and bosses, especially in this business. It really can change your nights the way you are greeted by your boss and the way you are treated.&nbsp; I can probably write a book with spicy details about restaurants.. that would make you like your guts out, and make you never want to go in certain places. But sometimes you find owners and managers that really take care of you, and make you feel comfortable while at work. <br />&nbsp;<br />Anyway, i hope to review many things i am knowledgeable of, so we can share our opinions.&nbsp;

				Hi All!<br /><br />My husband and I just moved to Astoria last week (coming from Jersey City, what a change! ;) I had visited the neighborhood a few times before and already liked it a lot, but now that we are here we are even more in love with our new surroundings! <br /><br />I look forward to get to know more of you, on- and possibly off-line. <br />I also created a blog about Astoria, check out www.iloveastoria.wordpress.com (http://www.iloveastoria.wordpress.com).<br /><br />Best,<br />Andreahttp://

				Hello! <br /><br />Hubby lived in Astoria for a while, and then moved to Florida where we met. He told me about the magic and awesomeness that is Astoria, and I said &quot;Let&#039;s GO!&quot; We moved here 2 years ago, and got married last year. So this was a move BACK for him. He loved it too much to let go. I feel that way now, too. <br /><br />We are both in our 30s. I am 33, an illustrator and artist, and specialize primarily in graphics for children&#039;s books, wedding invitations,&nbsp; and customized coloring books for kids, businesses, weddings and various other special events. I also paint on stuff I find, like furniture or doors or anything really. I love retro graphics, and my idols are Mary Blair, Kevin Kidney, and Jim Flora. I&#039;m also crazy about kids, and love to paint fun illustrations for them to decorate their rooms with n stuff. <br /><br />I have a passion for anything vintage from the 1920s through the early 1960s. I grew up in New Orleans. I like to listen to records. I don&#039;t know how to swing dance, but I really wish I did. I like to cook. I like really thick fuzzy socks. I like beet juice. I like to eat veggies from my CSA. I wear a funny red hat. I like vintage eyewear. I am really into tiki culture. I like to go out to eat with my foodie chowhound husband, and I&#039;ll try anything he throws my way except for balut. I like scary movies, but he does not. I like to sing rockabilly and jazz tunes. Loudly. I have a very strange cat. I like to eat things and it shows. I like it when it snows. I like the subway. Halloween is my favorite holiday. I like Obama!&nbsp; I like soup. <br /><br />Do you like soup too? Then let&#039;s be friends! :)<br />~Geeky Tiki

				I&#039;ve been hearing a lot about burglaries, some robberies, and that rapist running around, and as a native NYer I can tell you it&#039;s nothing shocking considering the current economic times.&nbsp; Conventional wisdom applies: try not to walk in desolate areas by yourself at night (girls AND guys!), get yourself some mace, take a self defense class, take a cab home, or get a big dog if your landlord allows it. Avoid living near &quot;borderline&quot; areas, aka, within spitting distance of the projects...because it doesn&#039;t take nearly as much effort to walk over 2 blocks to snatch your purse as it does to try to get a damn job.&nbsp; <br /><br />Have your keys in your hand--in fact, palm them and make a fist around them, with a key sticking out&nbsp; between each finger.&nbsp; Have your phone handy. Let your friends know when you&#039;ve arrived home. Let someone know you&#039;re COMING home! Don&#039;t listen to your ipod when you&#039;re walking down the street in the middle of the night.&nbsp; Travel in packs.&nbsp; Look behind you.&nbsp; Know where there is a business that is open late or 24 hrs in the vicinity where you&#039;re walking so that you can find someone to help you if you catch some creep following you.<br /><br />I am a native Manhattanite cheating on the LES with Astoria.&nbsp; We absolutely love our new home, and plan on raising our kids here.&nbsp; I&#039;m a bartender/cosmetology student by day and my fiancé is a graphic designer.&nbsp; One of the best things about Astoria is all the great shops (especially the bakeries, YUM, MARTHA&#039;S!) and the fact that small business can thrive here. There is a lot of stuff to do without having to go trekking into the LES or East Village like all the wannabes, college kids, and all of New Jersey, and it&#039;s more affordable and chill.&nbsp; The charm of the area is that homey sense of old school community, like I remember the NYC of my childhood being before the Starbucks-ification began...just, you know, with fewer crack dealers. A LOT FEWER.&nbsp; <br /><br />This neighborhood is pretty tight knit and safe, but just remember that you&#039;re still in a large City and the rules of common sense apply.&nbsp; You&#039;ve made a good choice moving here!&nbsp; Enjoy the area, Hope, and welcome!<br /><br /><br />

				What&#039;s up fellow Astorians.. I friggin love this place! The misses has been here 5 yrs and I&#039;m a recent transplant (2 yrs ago). I fell in love with this place right away. My little area of Astoria is quiet and old school, with enough pubs(BG, Sparrow, 24, Irish Rover&nbsp; :lol:)&nbsp; and good eats (Mezzo&#039;s, MichaelAngelos, Stamatis) nearby and you couldn&#039;t ask for better people.<br /><br />We just had a little Kid O a few weeks ago and we need to come up for air soon.. If anyone is interested in tennis this spring/summer lemme no. I&#039;m getting a Tennis Network together so people can find someone else to volley and/or find people with varying degrees of skill. If you&#039;ve ever played tennis before and want to get out there in 09, it&#039;s time to get in the network :mrgreen:<br /><br />The misses doesn&#039;t work anymore, so she&#039;s interested in a housewife&#039;s network and making sure our little one has other little ankle biters to roll with.. Any housewife with young kids network out there? <br /><br />All the best..

				Last time I was the italian restaurant on Ditmars (cant remember the name - Trattoria L&#039;In...something) they had a really nice wine bar that we enjoyed while waiting for a table. <br /><br />Also, my favorite- Vesta Wine bar and restaurant on 30th ave and 21st street. Its a bit of a walk from the subway but so well worth it and there is a bus that goes on 21st street to ditmars- though I dont know how often it comes or anything about it. I do know that I love love Vesta.

				hello! just thought i&#039;d pop my head in and say hi - been poking around the forums for a bit and people seem very friendly and helpful. awesome. my boyfriend and i will be moving down there from albany in a few weeks and i can&#039;t wait to settle in. i&#039;ve only spent a few days in astoria here and there, but i&#039;ve really loved it when i&#039;ve been there. he&#039;s a lawyer (eww, i know, hee) and i&#039;m a freelance writer. we&#039;re moving into a place on newtown near 27th, and i really love the apartment, so if that&#039;s actually a horrible neighborhood, don&#039;t tell me. no, tell me, i guess, but tell me soon &#039;cause we&#039;re supposed to sign the lease in the next couple of days.<br /><br />anyway. HI! i&#039;m a total internet junkie, so if there are any incredibly fantastic local blogs/websites/whatever i should be checking out, i&#039;d love to hear about it. also, anyone know if there&#039;s a gym in astoria for women? not curves, but a &quot;normal&quot; gym that&#039;s for chicks? i want to join a gym for the billionth time, but burly sweaty dudes make me feel lame while i&#039;m doing my 8-pound bicep curls or whatever.

				Hi everyone. I&#039;m glad I found this forum. I&#039;m Dorie and I lived in Astoria-Upper Ditmars area for most of my life until I was 25 yrs old. Damn that was 10 yrs ago!!! Then I got married and moved to Brooklyn and eventually to Middletown, NY. (Oh what a misfit I was up there!!! haha) I divorced and moved back to Queens in 2005 but I&#039;m now in Bayside.<br /><br />I can&#039;t believe how much Astoria has changed. Every time I drive down Steinway or Ditmars I see something new! I would love to move back to the neighborhood but the rent prices are ridiculous! What a mistake my father made years ago selling the house we had on 76th Street and Ditmars!!!<br /><br />By the way does anyone know when the feast is starting on Ditmars? Is it this weekend or next weekend? I&#039;m dying for some good ol&#039; greasy, sugary Zeppole and deep fried Oreos!! hahaha

				Hey guys!!!!<br /><br />Been living here in Astoria for exactly one month now....absolutely love it. Was born in brooklyn...grew up in NJ...then lived in Upper East Side in manhattan..now nice to be in Queens only a few streets from Astoria-Ditmars Blvd train. <br /><br />Lots of very friendly people in the neighborhood. I love how you can just go into a store and immediately you feel they are your friend. <br /><br />I am definitely a huge fan of Zorba&#039;s greek food...their Taziki sauce is the friggin best...and i love the friendlyness of Anthony &amp; Frank&#039;s deli...<br /><br />Does anyone though know of any jobs nearby that are hiring? Would like to cut the commute in half...even if its part time. <br /><br />Thanks guys..you rock!!<br /><br />-Mike&nbsp; &nbsp;8-)

				Hello everyone.&nbsp; My wife and I (I&#039;m Justin, my wife&#039;s name is Criss) are moving to Astoria (off the corner of Crescent &amp; Ditmars) on July 1st.&nbsp; I&#039;m 29, my wife will soon be 28.&nbsp; I&#039;m orginally from Delaware, my wife is from Romania.&nbsp; We moved to the Riverdale section of the Bronx last year, and were living with roommates to get us started with city-living.&nbsp; I&#039;ve gotten lucky and landed a great job with New York Life, so now we are finally getting our own place in Astoria.&nbsp; We chose the area due to the large greek and european influences that allow my wife to find most of the things she misses from Romania.<br /><br />We haven&#039;t taken much time to meet new people and make friends, but hopefully that will change now.&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				Hello All<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I just want to introduce myself. Most people in the neighborhood know me as Fane! Those that do are more than likely in thier 40&#039;s or 50&#039;s. Anyone who has hung out in astoria park in the last decade would recognize us. Us being me and the couple of old friends that i still get together with. We usually hang out in the area that we refer to as the triangle. This is becuase the foot paths roughly form a triangle. Its above the meadows towards 19th street near the hellgate train trestle. We usually listen to music out of a boom box and its usually old obscure music from the sixtees and seventees. Most responses are posative however rarely there might be a complaint from people who think that they are in a library. We are old school astoria. A throwback to the way cats hung out in the sevetees when music was shared, experienced together almost like a religious experience. Back then there would be people hanging out all along what was once called the strip along shore road listening to music out of boom boxes. we carry on that tradition. It has taken me a long time to use this medium becuase admittedly i am resistant to this overwhelming assault of technology which in our opinion is diluting humanity itself. Where people once socialized face to face in person now is through electronic gadgets. Admitedly i am finding myself increasingly isolated becuase of my reluctance to accept the changes taking place. But ther are a few of us old timers left in Astoria. In fact i am working on a series of graphic novels about the neighborhood and the guys i hang out with. The stories include most Astortia landmarks and life today from the perspective of us cats in our fourtees and fiftees. Anyhow i thank all who acknowledge this and i am glad to be a part of something that i hope others can relate to. <br /><br /><br />Peace to all<br /><br /><br />Fane&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				Welcome, Jonlife, and Insanefane!&nbsp; I really enjoyed reading your story, Fane.&nbsp; There are lots of regulars I notice in the park on my morning runs.&nbsp; There are a group of guys that hang out with their dogs near the track.&nbsp; &nbsp;One of the dogs, a boxer? - is paralyzed and gets around in&nbsp; a wheelchair.&nbsp; You can tell how much the owner loves this dog.&nbsp; She (?) is well taken care of, and looks like an overall sweet dog.&nbsp; He has another boxer too.&nbsp; His friend has a short black haired dog.&nbsp; I really like seeing these guys in the park, and seeing regulars like them in the park brings it a friendly familiar vibe.&nbsp; I&#039;ll keep a look out for your boom boxes.

				Hi, I&#039;m Ryan. I&#039;m new to the site. I&#039;m a photographer/artist/retoucher/teacher. I&#039;ve lived in Astoria for 3 years. was about to move to France and a bad series of events have left me looking for a studio apt. I love Astoria, so I am hoping to stick around and find something here. I need something cheap, if anyone knows of anything. I really like the Astoria Park area. I&#039;m currently in the 30th and Steinway area.

				Just moved to Astoria from the Upper East Side with my husband.&nbsp; We are on 41st St and Ditmars and love it here - love the cafes &amp; bakeries and local hardware stores and local pharmacies are a good thing!<br /><br />The only complaint I have is the foul smell&nbsp; :-o&nbsp; This is the Bowery Bay Sewage Treatment as I understand.&nbsp; Is this the norm??&nbsp; It&#039;s pretty bad.<br /><br />Looking forward to reading lots of your posts to gain some insider info on Astoria.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Hi,<br /><br />I married my way into Astoria shortly before retiring from the Navy a few years ago.<br /><br />I am not native to the area, or to anywhere really, since I spent most of my twenty year career either overseas, getting ready to go overseas or recovering from being overseas.&nbsp; Before that, I followed my father around as he did pretty much the same thing.&nbsp; The Navy is something of a family business going back to World War Two.<br /><br />I live in far northwest corner of Astoria, downwind from the Ward&#039;s Island treatment plant on some days, from the Bowery Bay plant on others.&nbsp; :|

Thanks for that.<br /><br />I remember reading someone&#039;s post about a desire to have more long term renters because short term renters in the area treat it like it&#039;s a hotel or stop on the way to somewhere better. High turnover often goes hand in hand with disrespectful attitudes and behaviors, but- not always. I&#039;m not a native Astorian but like the part of Astoria in which I live. With the exception of the ongoing native vs. nonnative diatribe on community message boards, I have not had any experiences, good or bad, with anyone in the real live world about this subject. To me, that&#039;s a good thing because the more hospitable the people are within a given neighborhood, the more cohesive it becomes which will hopefully keep residents here longer, thus diminishing the tenant turnover.

				Me and my girlfriend just moved to Astoria now that we&#039;ve transferred colleges to CUNY Baruch. We&#039;re originally from Ulster County. We&#039;re not &quot;hipsters&quot; and would prefer not to be considered &quot;transplants&quot; as it makes us feel like we were surgically bound to the area. I&#039;m thinking there&#039;s probably no way of shedding that label without a serious time investment in the area and community.<br /><br />We&#039;ve got another 3 years of school before we can get our CPA&#039;s so we&#039;ll be around here for at least that long, and hopefully much longer. <br /><br />If anyone knows of some good places to grab some food, please let me know.

				I don&#039;t mind driving a ways to get to some great food. Our last apartment we were a 30 minute drive from the nearest legit restaurant (or anything else) in any direction, so I&#039;m no stranger to having to spend a bit of time travelling to find some grub.<br /><br />As for the type of cuisine, I&#039;ve been craving Thai food lately, but I&#039;m really up for trying anything. Foreign cuisine is a bit of a rarity in the town we come from, and I&#039;m starving for some variety.

				Hey everyone.<br /><br />I&#039;m moving to Astoria on September 1st from Upstate NY hoping to get some work in the film business (directing, producing, marketing, casting, etc). The entire side of my dad&#039;s family were born and raised in Astoria (and some even built houses in the Ditmars area) so it seemed natural to look into it as a possible place to live. After visiting a few times I loved it and now have an apartment on 44th street.<br /><br />My first question I have deals with the trains. I will be moving into an apartment on 44th street fairly close to Astoria Blvd. My family tells me to take the Subway on 46th street because it&#039;s, in their words, &quot;better&quot; than the elevated train. Anyone have any thoughts or opinions on this? <br /><br />Secondly, what does everyone do for cable in Astoria? Is Time Warner Cable the most popular option?<br /><br />And finally, I&#039;m a pretty big fan of watching Stand-Up Comedy. I know there are several clubs in Manhattan but is there any stand-up comedy in Astoria? Someone told me that the Waltz-Astoria that has comedy?<br /><br />Any help would be greatly appreciated. <br /><br />Thanks!

				Hello Astorians-<br /><br />I&#039;ve been lurking around reading posts for a while and thought, what the heck, I&#039;ll register and post something.<br />I&#039;ve lived in Astoria for just about 2 years with my family. I wanted to move here primarily due to the decent elementary schools, somewhat more reasonable rent and the not having&nbsp; to commute to work from a great distance. Since I don&#039;t commute during NYC traditional rush hour, it&#039;s a pleasant ride in to Midtown.<br />So far we like it here and since we have a child in a public school here we feel more connected to the neighborhood and more invested in where the neighborhood goes from here.<br />

My name is Yuki Endo and I was born in Kyoto, Japan, but move to NY in Feb 1996.<br />You may know&nbsp; me from 2005 X-mas New York Times Article featuring &quot;He Loves New York, and It Loves Him Right Back.&quot;<br /><br />I have helped QM22 riders with handing out fliers, getting petition to bring back QM22 bus.<br /><br />I have taken QM22 one time when it only had two trips into Manhattan via 6th Av I think from near Ditmars Blvd/77th St something.

				Hi, <br />I&#039;m Francisco and recently moved to Astoria with my girlfriend.&nbsp; Originally from Ecuador, but raised in Brooklyn and Staten Island.&nbsp; I work as an office manager in a Brooklyn while I get a second degree in Civil Engineering from CCNY.&nbsp; We live in the top floor of our building and it is really hot in our apartment right now because our AC is not big enough.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />

				Well, Hello.<br />&nbsp;<br />I&#039;ve been in Astoria for more than 20 years, beginning when Little Egypt on Steinway consisted of, well, Ali.<br />&nbsp;<br />I found this forum twice through google in the last couple of days, as I tried to find out what happened to the Pasha eatery and if anyone else hates A-1 Courier service for Amazon as I do.&nbsp; I figured it must be kismet<br />&nbsp;<br />Astoria is definitely a Herakleitan experience.&nbsp; Panta reis, ouden menes.

				Hi Everyone,<br />I recently moved to Astoria back in July from Jackson Heights. I used to go to St.John&#039;s Prep so I became familiar with the area, but once I graduated h.s, I never came back to Astoria. I haven&#039;t gone out so much due to always being tired from work. But another reason is because I don&#039;t know many people out here, and it gets lonely at times since most of my friends live far from me. Are there any good places to meet nice people in mid to late 20s in Astoria? Bars sound reasonable but a change from bars would be preferable.&nbsp; :cheesy:

				Hello!<br /><br />I&#039;m actually an LIC/Astoria native, but I love my neighborhood and thought I&#039;d head onto this forum to connect with some other locals. Several years back someone actually helped me find my lost dog on here!<br />

				Hello everyone, my name is Edward, although some people call me Ted. I am a fourteen year old high school student at The Bronx High School of Science, and I live right here in Astoria. Currently I am doing an English paper about the G&amp;T schools in Astoria, as this topic means quite a bit to me and I easily relate to it.&nbsp; That sounds about it really, I can&#039;t think of anything else to say. It&#039;s nice to meet you all, and I will try my best to stay active even after this English paper!

				Hi!<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve been in Astoria for five years now, and I&#039;ve love every minute of it! I&#039;m actually part of some local civic groups, including the Long Island City Alliance. If you&#039;ve got any concerns about local issues, e.g. parks, sanitation, traffic, etc., let me know - we&#039;re always looking to do more!

I have actually been following most of the threads here months before when moving here was still uncertain but now that we&#039;re here, I decided that it&#039;s time to join and become a member.&nbsp; Anyway, there are still a lot to experience here in Astoria and we&#039;re both very very excited about it.&nbsp;

				Haha, I&#039;m not going to say OK. I&#039;m just saying &quot;Hello, everyone!&quot;<br />I&#039;m Cocoli and I just joined here a moment ago. I&#039;m 27 years old and I work as a designer in Chicago now. But my uncle has been lived in Astoria for years. Astoria has my wonderful childhood memories. So very thanks for my uncle&#039;s caring. I&#039;m an optimistic, passionate, easygoing and aspiration woman. I like reading, photography, singing and traveling in my spare time. However, fashion design is my favourite. I&#039;m really intersted in studying fashionable products like clothes and apparel. And some inspiration from the common occasion really makes me excited. So if you&#039;re a fashion lover, welcome!&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />Thank you!
