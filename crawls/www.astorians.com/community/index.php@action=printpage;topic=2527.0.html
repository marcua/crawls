				Hello everyone! I&#39;m looking into moving to Astoria this August. I will be a 1st year graduate student and I&#39;m aiming to find a one bed room apartment. <br /><br />Presently, I live in Georgia and can only make myself available for a week in mid July for apartment hunting. Can anyone recommend any brokers? What info should I expect to bring up with me? <br /><br />Any advice on finding/dealing with a broker, making the move, and the neighborhood would be greatly appreciated. Thanks guys!

				Welcome! Will this be your first time in NY, or do you already know the area?<br /><br />I suppose I need to know what your price range is, and whether you&#39;ll be willing to share a place. I can probably recommend a few brokers and websites.

				I wish someone had told me ahead of time how much paperwork I would need to find an apartment in New York. &nbsp; :-( <br /><br />This would be: 2 forms of ID, tax returns from the past 2-3 years, a letter from your employer stating your annual salary (or a letter from your university stating that you&#39;ll be an enrolled student and the amount of your fellowship). &nbsp;You&#39;ll need to demonstrate that your monthly salary is 15x the monthly rent (I think), or else have a guarantor. &nbsp;It couldn&#39;t hurt to have the contact info of previous landlords ready in case you need a recommendation, and a recent credit report if you have it. &nbsp;Have I left anything out?<br /><br />My husband and I found our apartment by looking in the ads in the Village Voice. &nbsp;We really lucked out. &nbsp;You can also try looking ahead of time on Craigslist and setting up appointments. &nbsp;You can save a lot in realtor&#39;s fees if you deal directly with landlords.<br /><br />Since you&#39;ll be going to school everyday, I would also recommend getting to know the subway system and try to find a place near a train station or bus stop. <br /><br />Good luck!

				Thanks for all the wonderful advice mcw! That&#39;s very helpful. <br /><br />I will make sure to have all of that paperwork, at least the better part of it. I will be living off of student loans and I plan to have a guarantor. I hoping to find a broker/landlord that doesn&#39;t mind dealing with that. <br /><br />I&#39;m going to attempt finding something through craigslist and village voice but craigslist is looking very, very bleak since they started charging fees for broker ads and V V seems to be almost all broker fee listings. It seems that the situation that I am in (only a week to find a place, being a student, and not familiar with the area), it much easier to find someone to help me out.

				Yeah, you may well bite the bullet and talk to brokers, even though it&#39;ll cost you. The majority of landlords here work only with brokers, not with that new-fangled Internet thing, so the selection&#39;s a lot better here with brokers.<br /><br />You shouldn&#39;t have too much problem finding a 1-BR for $1200, although it may not be the nicest or the nearest to the trains. Oh, and the rule of thumb is that your annual income should be 40x your monthly rent, although lots of people bend that rule. <br /><br />And if you&#39;re here mid-July you might have trouble getting a September 1st start on a lease. Typically leases start less than 30 days after signing in NYC, since it&#39;s hard to show an apartment here when it&#39;s still occupied for some bizzare reason.<br />

				also<br />be sure to be ready for that <br />1st/last/deposit/realtor fee (that could be 4 x one months rent!)<br />I did well with Dynasty realty on 30th Ave - they put me in a one bedroom 3 years ago for $900??<br />I only had to pay 1st and maybe a deposit - and then the realtor told me because they didn&#39;t require last months (or maybe it was the other way - i paid last and didn&#39;t require a deposit) the realtor was then &quot;supposed&quot; &quot;expected?&quot; to charge 1.5 x 1 month for their fee.&nbsp; UGH!!<br /><br />I paid it.&nbsp; It was a great apartment.&nbsp; I didn&#39;t stay b/c I met my honey living around the corner - we moved in to a place together and got married.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />

Great info as well! <br /><br />I&#39;ve been told that around 2-3 weeks before you would like to move is when you should look. Do most people find something before that? I&#39;d be in a bit of a crunch if I had to move in early September but it would be managable.

Much appreciated! <br /><br />I am planning for first/last/security/broker fee. So, in short, I suppose I need about 5 months rent in total. (Over compensating if the broker charges more than one month&#39;s rent.) Correct? <br /><br />Is the last month a common fee? I don&#39;t see that on many ideas but I do see it from time to time. <br /><br />Finally, how quickly should I expect a broker to help me find a place? Can this been done in a day or two? I&#39;ve been told I need to be prepared to jump on an apartment immediately after I see it.

				Check with your university&#39;s student affairs office, or your department. Wouldn&#39;t they help you with relocation?<br /><br />There are by-owner/no-fee CraigsList postings; you can also keyword search on &quot;Astoria&quot; in the rentals section. It&#39;s definitely the place to start. <br /><br />Some agencies I worked with when I was looking for a place:<br />Amorelli Realty,&nbsp; 36-01 30th Ave, (718) 204-2828<br />Century 21/Alexiou Realty, 31-23 23rd Ave, (718) 204-0101 http://www.c21alexiourealty.com (http://www.c21alexiourealty.com)<br />Metropolis Realty, 29-17 23rd Ave, (718) 545-9700 http://www.metropolisrealtor.com (http://www.metropolisrealtor.com)<br />Zapiti Realty, 22-74 31st St, (718) 274-5100 <br /><br />Most landlords want first and last month&#39;s rent, plus cleaning deposit of 1 month&#39;s rent. When I was looking at apartments (several years ago now) the Queens agencies had the cheapest fees, only 1 month&#39;s rent. Still pricey.

				Definitely don&#39;t delay if you see a place you like. <br />Amorelli Realty is good, I used Neon myself - (718) 545-8474 and have stayed in the same apartment for 12 years.&nbsp; The realty firms seem to have most of the connections to the small property owners and can get you better deals, but you have to pay the broker fee.&nbsp; <br />Southern Astoria, 30th Avenue and South tends to be more lively at night, Northern Astoria, more residential.&nbsp; See if you can see apartments in both areas, and even the middle - find what area feels best to you.<br />Where in Georgia are you from?&nbsp; (I&#39;m from Fayetteville myself)<br />Dirk

				We paid our deposit to our landlord with a personal check from our out of state bank, and it was fine.&nbsp; There&#39;s currently a thread on here about banks in Astoria/New York with a lot of helpful info.<br /><br />Here is a link for the MTA website, where you can find the subway and bus maps: <br />http://www.mta.nyc.ny.us/index.html.&nbsp; There is also a great guidebook called the Not for Tourists guide to New York City, which is great for maps and finding your way around the city.&nbsp; I&#39;ve heard there is also a NFT guide to Astoria, although I haven&#39;t seen it yet.<br /><br />Good luck!

Ordinarily I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to tell you to get him to me, but I couldn&#39;t risk the situation. I&#39;ve done it before on this board when someone else was in trouble finding a place with a dog.&nbsp; I kept him here for a couple of weeks and it worked out fine. But a rottie is just too big for the pups I watch. My own 2 plus the 3 others that I care for (combined) weigh less than your rottie. If just being playful he were to swat at one of them he could do serious damage. Try posting under <strong>Astoria Businesses / Services Offered / Help Needed</strong> perhaps some other good soul will care for him while you get situated. Good luck.&nbsp; :cry:

				there is an apartment complex on 27 and 21 Ave all the way down to Shore Blvd, no fee, seems to have great management company.&nbsp; Nice apartments, well-kept as far as I can tell.&nbsp; They do accept dogs, the phone number is on a sign at the building, I think on 26th St and 21 Ave.&nbsp; You can make an apt and fill out an application.&nbsp; The one-bedrooms run for about 1050-1200, 1400-1600 for 2bedroom, rent stablized.

				I decided to post this, because so many people here ask this same question, and I have an email I send to friends to help out - so here it is:<br />The following is an email I send to my friends interested in renting in Astoria, and is based on 9 years of doing so, making mistakes, and learning from them.<br /><br />It&#39;s hit or miss with Craigslist, a lot by owner is overpriced, and a lot by realtor are bait and switch to get you to call.&nbsp; Newsday on Friday, Voice on Tuesday, and Sunday Times are great.&nbsp; Always ask the fee, stick to a month because that&#39;s what most realtors do here, do not let them charge 12.5 % of year, if they think they can get away with it they will.&nbsp; I have walked out of realtors offices over this, and found someone else who charges me a month.&nbsp; Remax is okay but stress your price, they will show you stuff out of your range if they can.&nbsp; &nbsp;I cannot stress the importance of a good landlord, they will make your living situation so much happier.<br /><br />Christina Thermos - She&#39;s the realtor that got me my studio.&nbsp; She is really nice and attentive.&nbsp; 22-77 31 St.&nbsp; Astoria, NY 11105<br />718-204-5000<br />www.buysellrealestate.com<br /><br />Here are two others that were nice<br />Alex Kouzouloglou<br />Metropolis Realty<br />718-545-9700<br />29-17 23rd Ave<br />Astoria<br /><br />Global City Realty <br />35-10 Broadway Ste.207 Astoria, NY 11106&nbsp;&nbsp; Telephone: 718 932-4097<br /><br />I did not have a good experience with Capital or Defalco realty.<br /><br />Credit checks only cost $20-30 so be careful they don&#39;t sneak an overcharge for you.&nbsp; If you have your own, you might not get charged at all.&nbsp; Key deposits are illegal.&nbsp; I have at least 4 friends with one-bedrooms for under $1000, they do exist but are hard to find, and with luck and perseverance you will find one.&nbsp; Bring your atm card, most realtors do not accept personal checks, be ready to put down a deposit if you like something, or else it will be gone.<br /><br />Good luck!<br /><br />Things to look for that you might want-<br /><br />1. Ample closet space (at the very least, a closet in the bedrooms) <br />2. No electric heat, would like to have own thermostat but not necessary <br />3. Good access to sun and ventilation, above 1st Floor, and have view of something other than another building wall <br />4. Full KIT and bathroom, no efficiencies <br />5. Updated electrical wiring – for example, more than one 15 watt fuse for entire apartment, more than one (grounded) outlet per room <br />6. Safety of area <br />7. Proximity to transit <br />8. Laundry in blg?&nbsp; Where?&nbsp; More than one machine (if communal)? <br />9. Nearest grocery store <br />10. Thickness of surrounding walls, does all noise travel easily? <br />11. Rules? <br />12. hardwood finished floors <br />13.&nbsp; Plumbing, condition of walls - no mildew<br />14.&nbsp; &nbsp;Landlord who cares about building, and fixes things<br />15.&nbsp; Cleanliness of blg, extermination, no roaches, etc.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Hello...I have been lurking on this board for a while and I finally felt the need to chime in...<br /><br />In regards to a guarantor...some companies require the guarantor to be in the tri-state area.&nbsp; &nbsp;I just wanted to point this out since you said you were moving from Georgia.&nbsp; <br /><br />I worked countless realtors and I felt that Metropolis was a good outfit.&nbsp; &nbsp;I did not find an apartment through them, but they were honest and did not show us places that were not appropriate for our price range or specifications.&nbsp; &nbsp;I did not like the people at Global Realty or Astoria Realty...but I will not get into that.&nbsp; &nbsp;Just my 2 cents if it helps any...

				I used Marathon real estate as a broker to find my rental apt in Astoria 3 years ago. (Marathon is located on the corner of Broadway and 31st.) The lady there is a longtime broker here. They showed me 4-5 places and I fell in love with this one. I paid a one-month broker fee and didn&#39;t have to go through a lot of trouble - met the owner/landlord, who owns 3 buildings around here. Showed him a couple of tax returns and that was that.<br /><br />Normally I would have avoided brokers but I was not familiar with Astoria and was short on time.

				I just wanted to say thanks to all of you! This thread has been an enormous help towards my upcoming move! <br /><br />If a tenth of Astoria is as nice as helpful as the folks on the board, living there will be better than I ever expected!<br /><br />Please, if anyone else has any other helpful info feel free to keep posting. I&#39;m going to keep track of this thread and update y&#39;all on how the search goes. Much appreciated!

				You should definitely look into Alexiou Real State Century 21, they are very professional.&nbsp; I just had Peter M. found me an apartment by Ditmars and he was very very good, he knew what I want and show me some very good places.

				Yes, Kim at Halvatzis is great. She found us our last apt. 6 years ago. She grew up here and she knows the &#039;hood.<br /><br />Three years ago, a woman named Lydia Bueso-Roman at Remax found us our current apt. She was awesome. She only showed us a total of four apts. The first time we met her, she told us that she would show us three apts. that we would hate, and that we would take the next one she showed us after that. And she was right! She got a feel for what we were looking for the first day, and the next apt. she showed us was the one! And this was after 6 weeks of hunting.<br /><br />Lydia Bueso-Roman<br />Remax<br />32-75 Steinway St.<br />718-726-1700 <br /><br />Good luck and welcome to the neighborhood!
