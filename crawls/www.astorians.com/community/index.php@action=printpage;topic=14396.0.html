				Queens welcomed an exciting arrival to the Astoria neighborhood this spring just in time to shape up for summer.&nbsp; CrossFit Queens.&nbsp; More Intensity + Less Time = More results!&nbsp; &nbsp;www.crossfitqueensny.com<br /><br />CrossFit Queens.&nbsp; We are the first and only affiliate of CrossFit in Queens.&nbsp; Run by two Level 1 CrossFit coaches, Paul Coviello and Brandy Monge, both Queens locals.&nbsp; CrossFit Queens strives to create a community of people who want to train hard and have fun while doing it. The CrossFit program is experiencing explosive growth. The number of CrossFit-affiliated gyms has exploded from 18 in 2005 to 1,000 on March 2, 2009.<br /><br />CrossFit is the sport of fitness!&nbsp; Our approach to fitness delivers results that far surpass most health clubs.&nbsp; People don’t come in and head for a 30 min treadmill workout watching their favorite show or reading the paper. Nor do they go to the mirrors to crank out a set of bicep curls at a leisurely pace.&nbsp; At CrossFit Queens our athletes perform a timed or task oriented Workout of the Day (WOD) in a group setting.&nbsp; The group setting is unique in that it inspires competition and camaraderie among its participants. <br /><br />CrossFit Queens is broad, efficient and scalable. The CrossFit training approach mixes basic gymnastics, plyometrics, bodyweight calisthenics, cardiovascular conditioning and weightlifting for an intense, challenging workout scaled to anyone’s level of fitness.&nbsp; To measure our athlete’s improvement we use repeatable benchmark workouts. It is just like taking a test each time the athlete is trying to score higher reps /weight or faster times...talk about motivation!<br /><br />Come try us for free!&nbsp; Currently we are offering the first 2 classes for free.&nbsp; Why 2?&nbsp; It&#039;s the best way to experience the program and see if it&#039;s for you.&nbsp; We are also excited to announce that we are expanding our schedule for April to accommodate growing demand.&nbsp; Our new schedule will be Tuesday&#039;s and Thursday&#039;s 7pm and Sunday&#039;s 11am and 12 noon.&nbsp; Once the mercury rises and the sun stays up a little longer, we will be adding park workouts to the schedule.<br /><br />Come down and join the group or email us to schedule some private time and experience the difference.&nbsp; We are looking forward to having you join us soon!<br /><br /><br />CrossFit Queens is located at<br />Loupakis Karate Center<br />28-42 31 Street (between 30th Ave and Newtown Rd)<br />Astoria, NY 11102<br />www.crossfitqueensny.com<br /><br /><br />New Schedule (Beginning April 2nd):&nbsp; Tuesday and Thursday 7pm, Sunday 11am and 12 Noon<br /><br />Contact Information:<br />Paul Coviello and Brandy Monge<br />Paul@crossfitqueensny.com, brandymonge@gmail.com
