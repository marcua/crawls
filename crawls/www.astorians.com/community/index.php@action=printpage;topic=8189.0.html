				Hi,&nbsp; I recently noticed that my digital camera is not working.&nbsp; It was a $250-300 camera that I bought two years ago at Best Buy, when it broke I took it back there but I was told that it would be at least $170 to have the geek squad fix it. Does anyone know of a local place or place in Manhattan that might fix cameras for a better price?&nbsp; I would hate to just throw it away-&nbsp;

				What kind of camera is it?&nbsp; I am having the same problem.&nbsp; I bought mine back in July and Kodak is saying they won&#039;t fix it although so many people are having the same issue (LCD cracking).&nbsp; I have a Kodak EasyShare V803

				This said, cameras (or other consumer electronics) in the $250 range are not really designed to be repaired. If it were under warranty, the company would likely just confirm that it&#039;s broken, then give you a new (or refurbished) unit. In fact, you might be able to find a refurbished unit of the same model on eBay for less than the cost of any repair. FWIW, I agree with the Photo-Tech recommendation, if you do decide to get an estimate...<br />
