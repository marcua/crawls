				We&#039;re paying $1550 for a 2br in a small private house. Our lease is up at the end of September. The landlords want to raise the rent by $50/month to cover increased heating costs, which they cover, not us. $50 per month seems excessive, does anyone know if this is reasonable? It seems totally unfair. <br /><br />Also, they are trying to sell the building and therefore want us to pay month-to-month and NOT give us a year long lease. I was wondering if we have any rights in terms of rent increases if we have not signed a lease? <br /><br />Since we&#039;re in a 2-unit house, not a rent-stabilized building, I know the landlords can do anything they please, but I&#039;m hoping we can figure out a way to get a lease so at least we are protected under the sale. <br /><br />Thanks!

				http://www.centralastoria.org/services.htm<br />I would start by calling these people, they may be able to help you out regarding the sale of the house, and whether or not you can stay, lease issues, etc.&nbsp; In my experience, owners of apartments that are not rent-stabilized can raise the rent however much they please, and you&#039;re pretty lucky it&#039;s only $50.&nbsp; It really depends on your landlord and what they feel is fair.

				During the winter my heating bill is frequently $150+ per month. During the summer months it&#039;s about $30/mo.<br /><br />$50/mo is pretty reasonable if they expect you to pay your own heating. You might want to tell them that $600/year for heat is not reasonable, but that you&#039;d be willing to pay $300 ($25/mo) and see what they say.

				Try bargaining.&nbsp; If he doesn&#039;t give you a year lease, tell him to give you a break on the rent.&nbsp; Or if you are going to pay the $50/month, then he has to give you a years lease.

				Thanks for the info! I&#039;ve always lived in apts where the heat was covered by the landlord, so I had no idea what costs were like. <br />We&#039;re contacting the Central Astoria LDC today, and we&#039;re going to meet with the broker who got us the place to see if she can mediate the negotiations.

				In my opinion, $50 a month is about fair. If you lived in a rent stabilized apartment and your lease was up right now you&#039;d be paying a $66 increase per month for a one-year lease. Of course you can try to negotiate, but I don&#039;t think you&#039;ll get that far when you&#039;re being charged less than inflation. <br /><br />

				Landlords in private houses can do what they want. The fact that he is going month to month should be a sign for you to find another Apt.<br />&nbsp;He can raise your rent every month. I am not saying he will, but he can. Unless it is a multiple dwelling (3 apts or more) you have very little<br />rights as a tenant. For more info call 311 ask about housing rights.<br />Good Luck!&nbsp;

				[mod]Hi guys, I have some helpful advice to give. You may want to consider not forwarding payment to the landlord [/mod] ..He should be lowering your rent $50 for the aggravation of allowing your apartment to be shown.<br /><br />So Just Move out when your lease is up, and he will be stuck since no one will rent month to month on a house thats up for sale.<br /><br />He thinks you are a patsy, and wont move until you are forced to.<br /><br />Don&#039;t forget take lots of pictures, and just assume you will have to sue him for the deposit back. Also make a note a LL cannot deduct a lot of repairs when he moves back in or sells the house.&nbsp; For example a stained carpet is perfectly fine for a rental, but if he replaces it is on his dime not Yours.&nbsp;

				A $50 increase doesn&#039;t seem too bad to me since you are paying $1550 and your lease is up.&nbsp; That&#039;s only about a 3% increase, not too horrible.&nbsp; One thing to keep in mind, if you get a lease, it would not necessarily protect you from having to leave if your landlord sells the place.&nbsp; Most leases I&#039;ve read have a clause built in that nullifies the tenant&#039;s right to the apartment upon sale, and many buyers require the place to be delivered vacant.&nbsp; <br /><br />How is stiffing the landlord the right thing?

				NO actually [mod]it&#039;s a lot more advantageous to sign a lease[/mod],&nbsp; then if the new owner wants to move in,&nbsp; one of them will have to pay you move, refund your deposit and they cant deduct for any damages since a house sells as-is....so its a much better deal for the tenant to get a years lease.<br /><br />what you DON&quot;T want is a month to month lease if its up for sale.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=7401.msg88227.html#msg88227">Quote from: mcw on August 16, 2007, 06:13:29 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Or in other words: &quot;Do not sign a lease if you know that the building is going to be up for sale.&nbsp; It&#039;s better to move at the end of your lease and find a new apartment altogether.&quot;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				&nbsp; Just simple contract law.&nbsp; &nbsp;A lease is a lease and it binds both parties.&nbsp; No if ands or buts.&nbsp; If a landlord can sue me for lost rent&nbsp; advertising and any out of pocket expenses he incurs...well it works in reverse too...i can sue for my out of pocket losses if he wants to break the lease.<br /><br />&nbsp; So if the LL wont sign a new years lease then move when it expires,&nbsp; then he can sell the house empty and no problems.&nbsp; Of course he still has to pay the mortgage and bills each month with no rental income.&nbsp;

				This information and the back and forth replies have been interesting and illuminating.<br /><br />The reality of the situation for us, in the middle of it, is that we don&#039;t have a lot of options. We tried negotiating with the landlords, asked for a year lease, or any lease, and offered compromises to counter the $50/month increase. They were not at all flexible on either count, citing that having a binding lease could negatively impact their sale and that &quot;everyone does month to month, leases are very uncommon in these private houses&quot; (bullshit). The only thing they agreed to do was put in writing that they would not increase the rent for one full year. by then we hope to be gone anyway.<br /><br />As much as we would like to fight them on this, and leave the apartment so they&#039;ll have to suffer with finding new tenants, it&#039;s not possible. We can&#039;t afford to move again within a year. And as for putting up a fight, they&#039;ll just kick us out so they don&#039;t need to deal with us. <br /><br />Much to my chagrin, we&#039;re staying put for now and sucking up the situation.<br /><br />This is our last straw in Astoria. I have been here 5 yrs, I absolutely love the neighborhood. I would love to stay here, raise a family, continue to be a part of this vibrant community. But with prices for cruddy 2 story houses close to a million, rents soaring towards $2000, and renters having very little peace of mind and security, our next move is going to be out of the city altogether. I would rather afford property of my very own in a small town in NJ, and walk away from this nonsense rather than go into serious debt to stay, and become a part of the yuppie gentrification PROBLEM that&#039;s invaded the market. <br /><br />

				Ariana –<br />The reason for the increase in your rent doesn’t really matter. It could be due to increased energy costs as your landlord indicated, or it could be any other reason --&nbsp; increased insurance, taxes, inflation, whatever – or it could be no reason at all.&nbsp; When it comes down to it your landlord simply wants $50 more per month and he doesn’t have to justify it. – especially since your apartment isn’t covered by rent regulations.<br /><br />Only you can decide if your place is worth $1600 per month. Given that heat and hot water are included in most New York rentals, $1600 for a two bedroom in Astoria is not out of line (or so it seems for when I look at current listings).<br /><br />But to me your problem really is not the increase in rent but that your landlord is selling the property. If it were me, I’d start looking for a new place. It’s a major pain to live through a sale. Potential buyers will want to view your apartment and you’ll have people in and out. And in the end you make end up having to move anyway (given proper and legal notice of course). <br /><br />As Jtrane suggested, If you prefer to stay there’s nothing stopping you from making a counteroffer. You could say that you’ll stay only at the current rent -- given the inconveniences you’ll have to put up with during the sale, possibly having to move, etc.<br /><br />If LL still insists on an increase I would still equally insist on a new lease, even if it states that it’s on a month-to-month basis, with the new rent in writing.<br /><br /><br />
