				Title: <strong>Hellsgate CSA</strong><br />

				Just want to &quot;warn&quot; anyone who is a &quot;member&quot; of Hellsgate CSA -- the organization is run arbitrarily . . . deciding who gets to participate and who does not.&nbsp; I was a supporter of the CSA from the day it started (and in fact, a close friend was instrumental in bringing the CSA to Astoria), and Hellsgate CSA autocratically decided &quot;not to offer&quot; me an invitation to participate.&nbsp; Seems that a bunch of us were allegedly sent emails to renew, yet never received anything, and were subsequently dumped off the CSA. Hellsgate CSA might try to tell you that you didn&#039;t volunteer in what they deem to be an appropriate manner (and seems they have some &#039;secret file&#039; that is checked if you ask any questions), and uses that as justification to drop you, and insists that an email was sent.&nbsp; If in fact emails had been sent, I would not have become aware of these arbitrary and autocratic maneuvers by a few folks who seem to be motivated by power rather than creating a sense of COMMUNITY.<br /><br />While my life will not end by being denied participation, the entire process merely demonstrates the crummy way in which these people have decided to run what should be a COMMUNITY supported organization.&nbsp; Seems Hellsgate CSA have crowned themselves the arbiter of who can be in a community and who is excluded on their shady excuses.<br /><br />The tragedy here is that it is the farmers themselves who suffer from actions like this.&nbsp; Although, because there is demand for the CSA, hopefully the farmers will not suffer.&nbsp; But it is clear that this CSA needs to find its roots and its original COMMUNITY spirit!<br /><br /><br /><strong>Moderator note: this post was edited to comply with board rules.</strong><br /><br /><br />
