				Hi, I thought I&#039;d start a thread about the Meat/Eggs/Dairy products. What have people bought that they really liked? What did you do with it? What have you bought that was disappointing? What are you tempted to try but want reviews of first?<br /><br />I&#039;ll start. We got a ham steak recently that was quite good. Here&#039;s a picture of it frying (I removed the bone before cooking):<br /><br />(http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1258/1449996157_a567c09305.jpg) (http://www.flickr.com/photos/33063428@N00/1449996157/)<br /><br />It was quite good, if severely old-school as far as fat goes. It was probably 30% fat by weight, in contrast to most commercial pork which is as lean as chicken now. Still, fat is tasty, and this was no exception! One interesting thing was that, unlike other hams I&#039;ve had, the smokiness was not uniform throughout the meat. Parts near the outside of the ham were very pleasantly ham-flavored, while other areas were basically just work, and required a bit of supplemental fat for a true rich flavor. <br /><br />I&#039;d recommend the ham steaks, and would be interested to try them with some gravy or other topping for variety... Anyone else had a ham steak?<br />

				The pork in general is hands down the best I have ever eaten.&nbsp; The flavour is just amazing . . . and of course, the fat.&nbsp; &nbsp;:mrgreen:&nbsp; Unlike the grass-fed beef, which is quite lean, the heirloom pork (their pigs are a Hampshire-Berkshire cross) is much fattier than mass-produced pork.&nbsp; Their breakfast sausage is also great, and I don&#039;t usually like breakfast sausage.&nbsp; We had their pork chops tonight, in fact.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t bought any of their smoked meats, though.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also been happy with the lamb (little riblets! and chops), beef (ground - very lean, steaks (strip loin is delicious, and the skirt is small but cooks fast and is great), and roasts) and chicken (whole and separate breasts and legs) we&#039;ve had.&nbsp; The sheep&#039;s milk yogurt is fantastic, and the eggs are really good.&nbsp; I&#039;d say if anything I&#039;ve been a tiny bit disappointed with the cheeses I&#039;ve tried - they&#039;ve all been fine but haven&#039;t stood out in any way.<br /><br />We&#039;ve got a quarter goat in the freezer that I&#039;m looking forward to trying.&nbsp; And once the weather gets cooler I&#039;m going to make guanciale (http://www.babbonyc.com/in-guanciale.html) (using Mario Batali&#039;s recipe) from a pork jowl I got.

				Re cheese:<br /><br />3-Cornerfield, Brebi&#039;s &amp; Sushan Snow are quiet good (again with the awesome sheep milk).&nbsp; <br />Consider Bardwell&#039;s Dorset, tasty.<br />West River Creamery, Farmhouse Jack &amp; Chipotle Jack <br /><br />... are my staples.&nbsp;

I&#039;ve been mixed on the steaks, as they&#039;re so lean as to be difficult to pan-fry. Of the 5 or 6 dozen eggs we&#039;ve gotten, one batch had glowing orange yolks! Wonder what those chickens ate that week! They tasted extra rich, too.

				We&#039;ve been doing a lot of grilling of the steaks (strip loin, London Broil, blade, sirloin, ribeye, skirt, flank, and I think there&#039;s one other we tried as well) this summer, and they turn out great.&nbsp; But I&#039;ve also pan-fried a few (either cast iron skillet or ridged cast iron grill pan) and they are nearly as good.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have issues with the leanness, but I always cook them rare.&nbsp; I don&#039;t generally marinate them, either, although if I remember, I rub them lightly with olive oil before searing (but not grilling).&nbsp; I find the texture to be more robust, but they are not tough.<br /><br />One weekend in August, I had two steaks for back-to-back dinners - the first night we had a CSA steak, and the second night we had a steak bought from the butcher at the 30th Ave. Trade Fair.&nbsp; The difference in taste was startling.&nbsp; We all thought the meat from the butcher was bland and without much character.&nbsp; I&#039;ve gotten used to the grass-fed beef, and I&#039;m not sure I can (or want to) go back.

				The pork is the best I&#039;ve ever had, agreed. We got the 2 inch pork chops! HUGE! I was a little disappointed b/c one was like 1/4 fat and bone, but then it&#039;s like hey, save that fat for some of the eggs at a later date! HA! Made pork chops seared and finished in the oven with a brandy apple sauce. <br /><br />And agreed, the breakfast sausage is really good. I had to cut myself off. But hey, it&#039;s hard to find good breakfast sausage in Astoria!<br /><br />The ground pork was SO juicy! We actually lost a patty to the grill gods, it just fell apart! But it was worth it, the burgers we made with them were delicious!<br /><br />We always get the poterhouse and ribeyes. I think with the bone tastes best. I just put a straight salt/ pepper/ garlic/ sugar (to help caramelize) on them and pan sear them rare to medium-rare. Always really good. They are a little leaner (since they&#039;re not stuffed w/ corn and fat a la industrial cows) but I think the taste is great and the leanness never bothers me, nor do I find it hurting the cooking. Bought a flank steak this round and will be de-frostinig soon...<br /><br />The ground beef was really good too.<br /><br />The chicken! The whole chicken is AMAZING. I swear it&#039;s like biting into intensely rich chicken soup. Not only are the chickens super juicy, but the meat is the chicken-y-est chicken I&#039;ve ever had, if that makes any sense. It just tastes like chicken should taste. Not even Murray&#039;s or the stuff at International Meats they claim is organic is close in flavor. They are a little pricey, but SO good. I can&#039;t wait to use those leftover bones for some real soup when the weather cools.<br /><br />The eggs are fabulous. I had the best omelette the other morning. I&#039;ve never had such a fluffy omelette (and it&#039;s a great outlet for all the kale!).<br /><br />I like the goat cheese in the mixed herbs and I think the lavender is really interesting. And I agree, the dorset cheese was delicious. Had a little funk to it I love.<br /><br />The sheep&#039;s yogurt is good too. Great in smoothies!<br /><br />Oh and the bread! The raisin bread is out of this world! I now buy 1 loaf each of raisin, 8-grain and sourdough. Leave about 1/4 of each loaf out and freeze the rest for the rest of the month. The raisin, toasted with butter YES! And every time I pick it up the volunteers were saying how they were about to tear the bag open it smelled so good. <br /><br />Oh and the jams. I really like the Hot Chili Jam I think it is. Delicious on crackers with some soft cheese.<br />

				I&#039;ve been enjoying the Mettowee fresh goat for the last couple months.&nbsp; Really fresh and delicious.&nbsp; I also like the chipotle jack, the brebi blanche soft sheep&#039;s milk cheese, and the feta marinated in oil etc was great.&nbsp; I also like the londonderry.&nbsp; I ordered the herdsman, but the jury is out on that.&nbsp; It&#039;s rather mild.<br /><br />I love the eggs!<br /><br />I think I&#039;m going to have to consider the breakfast sausage, I think...

				The breakfast sausage is REALLY GOOD (from another non-sausage lover).<br /><br />Did anyone try the tilapia this month?

				Jayme- I think this is the first month the tilapia is available and most members don&#039;t know about it yet since I don&#039;t think it&#039;s on their site just yet. Hellgate must be on a different drop day than ours if you&#039;ve already had it. I&#039;m thinking of ordering it though, esp since they&#039;ll prob be scaling it now.<br /><br />

				I just cooked up some of the sweet sausage for breakfast - it&#039;s very good.&nbsp; Really moist and juicy pork, and so flavorful.&nbsp; I may have to make this a staple element in my orders.
