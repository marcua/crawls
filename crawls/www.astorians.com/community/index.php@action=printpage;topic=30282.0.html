				Tried an Iced Cappuccino - - it was SMALL, no lid for the cup used, coffee did not mix with the foam at ALL, and the ice cubes were too big - - impossible to drink or mix.&nbsp; It was their second day.&nbsp; Hope they get this BASIC drink down pat soon.&nbsp; Decor is great - - backyard is great - - donuts look amazing

				Part of me agrees with where Astoristani is coming from (I am a &#039;transplant&#039;, but have lived in Queens for 14 years). It is weird to suddenly see places selling those cold-pressed 10-dollar juices, and actual menus that look just like this hilarious parody site: http://www.brooklynbarmenus.com/ (http://www.brooklynbarmenus.com/)<br /><br /><br />I will say, though, that there&#039;s a difference between some of these places. Some seem more respectful of the existing neighborhood, and are welcoming, etc. Places like 60 Beans, OK, Jane&#039;s Ice Cream -- they are pricey for coffee/ice cream, but I go there knowing that and wanting a tastier drink, interesting flavor options, pleasant overall experience (maybe even chat with the owner, etc). Maybe this is douchebaggy, but I appreciate that I&#039;m staying in Astoria a lot more to meet friends, etc -- not going to Manhattan as much. <br /><br /><br />Gossip Coffee, which I tried a few weeks back, was the absolute worst, though -- I was stunned by the nasty, condescending rudeness of the counter servers (baristas? f- that) we encountered there. I&#039;d even tipped for the privilege. No idea if I even liked what I bought -- I was too stunned by the experience. And I&#039;ve lived in college-y cities with at-times obnoxious coffee house culture, but this was worse somehow (like they also didn&#039;t have any offerings there to really be snobby about?).

				Part of the problem is that rather than request decent stuff at regular older Astoria venues people go to &quot;fancy&quot; places which are really overpriced and surprisingly shallow. Their uniqueness is rooted in a &#039;rustic&#039; interior, fancy names of dishes, and a much higher price; meaning they&#039;re all different in exactly the same pretentious way essentially. So they charge more because of the perception by the newbies that it&#039;s somehow just as hip as Bushwick, eh, I mean Williamsburg, eh, I mean Park Slope, eh, I mean Dumbo, eh, I mean East Village once was..... but it&#039;s just overpriced hipsterness. <br /><br />Pancakes are an excellent example (yeah, I know it&#039;s a coffee house thread). You go to a greek diner and order pancakes and you get average stuff. Then you get fancy crepes, which are pancakes but thin, at $10, and that&#039;s some sort of progress for society. End result is that the diner raises its prices for their (now relativ to price) crappy pancakes. So now we have overpriced crappy pancakes, and overpriced thin pancakes.<br /><br />Same with coffee. Rather than get better stuff at regular places with less price increase the newbies want the overpriced fancy stuff because of the hard to resist thin-jeans-clad bearded lumberjack serving the beverage (or 60&#039;s-wardrobe-inspired lady).<br /><br />Speaking of sub-par local coffee, this appears to be me at my bitterest..... but looks can be deceiving... I&#039;m sure I can do worse...

				I have to agree with 98% of this. I now normally go to my local bodega when I want a coffee. Some bodegas in particular take pride in their brew. When I was kid 20+ years ago it was 50¢, now $1. Still a bargain and I get to BS with the same owners of the store from years ago:)

				Totally agree with y&#039;all on coffee but as to the pancakes -- a crepe is not just a thin pancake.&nbsp; Everybody keeps knocking $10 crepes, but at Locus Cafe they are filled crepes with an entire meal inside (canadian bacon, mozzarella and hollandaise, for instance, or smoked salmon with eggs) plus a side salad.&nbsp; It is an entire meal (in fact, I can never finish them) comparable to a full breakfast anywhere else.&nbsp; Also no aggravating hipster vibe at that place, so I would suggest trying it before you knock it.

				My favorite source for good, cheap coffee in Ditmars area is Rose &amp; Joe&#039;s bakery near the train station. Especially like the fact that it&#039;s self-serve. I think the problem w/ deli or bodega coffee is that it&#039;s rarely freshly made, but I imagine delis like the one you specify serve alot of coffee and there&#039;s always a new pot brewing.
