				Anybody else get the heebeegebies from the neighborhood when you walk to the train in the morning?&nbsp; I&#039;m in the Ditmars area, and the &#039;hood never fails to look horribly depressing and dreary as I&#039;m walking on the disgusting sidewalks and by the creepy old guys who purposely get up early to have coffee and stare at all the nicely dressed women walking to work.&nbsp; I came from Hoboken, which I understand is unusually well kept, but Christ almighty I don&#039;t know how long I&#039;m going to be able to stand the constant AMS (Astoria Morning Syndrome).&nbsp; Sometimes Astoria looks to me like the neighborhood that time (and the economy) forgot.&nbsp; What a s___-hole.&nbsp; Although sometimes I admit it can be nice in the eveninigs... at the beer garden in the summer, at least.

				To be fair, while the OP could have phrased his post in a less harsh manner, he does have a point in that certain thoroughfares, such as Ditmars Blvd. and 31st Street around the train station, and Steinway street all along the shopping strip, look pretty filthy late at night through early in the morning...garbage, crumpled up newspapers and circulars and bits of trash on the sidewalks.&nbsp; It&#039;s not a pretty sight.&nbsp; Chernobyl?&nbsp; Not at all...I&#039;d like to think that places like Newark, NJ are much closer to that distinction :)&nbsp; Plus, to Astoria&#039;s credit, most of that mess gets cleared up by the time everyone is awake, so that seems to indicate that most Astorians do care enough about their neighborhood to take care of such problems when they arise.<br /><br />As for the creepy staring guys, that&#039;s a whole other story.&nbsp; They seem to be part of the package, especially around the Ditmars area!

				I walk as a form of exercise - I am out and about by 5:30 a.m.&nbsp; Yes indeed, the Ditmars area looks pretty horrific in the morning.&nbsp; There is far too much trash out there and a few homeless men.&nbsp; If it bothers you however, you should do something about it.&nbsp; Call your local Councilman, whose office is right there.&nbsp; I love where I live - it is spotless.&nbsp; Also, if I walk up and down the local streets, where there are private homes, it is so clean.&nbsp; Ditmars gets lots of traffic.&nbsp; I would never move to New Jersey because of some trash and a few homeless!&nbsp;

				Although the post is a bit harsh...there is a good point in there.<br /><br />When I walk from the corner of Ditmars and 31st to the train in the morning it sometimes gets me down. There is always at least 2 or 3 bums hanging about (not to mentions creepy, smelly hand dancing guy at the top of the stairs), there is always a funky smell and water like substances in the street (usually cream colored), some of the stores are still closed and gated and people are just quiet and cheerless going to work. &nbsp;It could also be my attitude that I have to go to work and probably won&#039;t be home until 10pm, as well as the gamble of how the trains are going to run (They sucked today by the way). &nbsp;so from that prospective I agree.<br /><br />that being said, however, I still would take Astoria over dirty Jersey anyday. &nbsp;I don&#039;t give an F about how clean Hoboken is, you can keep it.<br /><br />Now -- Astoria any other time of day......... &nbsp;:-)

				As far as I can tell, most of the &quot;creepy old men&quot; are Greek and get up early because they are on Greek-time.&nbsp; The little coffee shop by me always has the greek chanel on in the morning and that holds their attention for the most part.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think the oogling of passersby is incidental.<br /><br />If it&#039;s so horrible here, feel free to leave.&nbsp; That will certainly make the neighborhood less gloomy&nbsp; :-)

				I stand corrected. I assumed the MFdobbs was female because he&#039;s objected to the self-described creepy &#039;stares&#039; of males. I will pay closer attention next time.<br /><br />I will gladly debate/discussion the cleaniness of Ditmars, which I agree leaves alot to be desired.<br /><br />But I love this neighborhood and I will defend it against anyone who labels it a Chernobly, a shithole or the most damaging, worse than Jersey.

				It&#039;s because we have those benches on 31st and Ditmars...it gives those guys the opportunity to sit for hours. Some of the homeless guys are staples on those benches. I think if they had to stand all day, they wouldn&#039;t congregate so much.

				I have to somewhat agree with the OP and I am off of 30th ave, not Ditmars.&nbsp; When walking west on 30th ave towards 31st the street is an absolute mess and it is disgusting almost every morning.&nbsp; There is rotting fish guts from the fish store and random blood and other unidentifiables from the meat market.&nbsp; The other day, I was walking by with my roommate and the butcher stepped one foot of of the market, held the door open with his other foot and proceeded to dump a tray of some sort of viscous fluid right in the doorway.&nbsp; <br /><br />I love Astoria, but it is indeed dirty at times...let&#039;s face facts.&nbsp; I would not call it Chernobyl, but the area could use some help in the litter department.&nbsp; How many times have you seen a car stopped at a light and the person just dumps their garbage out the window?

				I used to live in the Ditmars area and walked about 10 minutes to the subway in the morning. Walking to and from the subway before/after work were some of the best parts of my day, because it was just so lovely. <br /><br />I&#039;m an R train Astorian now, and I&#039;m not as fond of the Steinway Street area, but that&#039;s a personal preference and not because there is anything undesirable or threatening in the morning.

				I do sorta agree with the OP - I walk every morning from 21st to the train along Astoria Blvd - particularly as one gets closer to 31st, the amount of trash on the street just skyrockets. Having lived here for ages before I connected with any kind of community or found any cool bits of Astoria (my area not really being high on the &#039;cool&#039; scale) this was part of what made me convinced I lived somewhere horrible. I&#039;ve since settled in and found the awesome parts of Astoria, however I&#039;m embarrassed to walk with any non-Astorian friends and relatives (especially from O/S) through that mess. There&#039;s very few trash cans, the few that are there are open and trash easily blows out of them even if they&#039;re not overflowing, which they usually are, and there doesn&#039;t seem to be anyone cleaning up besides the occasional shop owner who cleans their small patch only regardless of the fact its all about to blow back in. Very little civic pride and no cleaning crews which I notice other neighbourhoods in NYC have, paid for by businesses - why not Astoria? All that trash just ends up in the East River, and degrades our neighbourhood in the meantime.

				There&#039;s a guy that cleans up around ditmars/31 - i usually see him out there around 10 in the morning. I believe it&#039;s some service paid for by the businesses in the area. the area is pretty decent after that but there&#039;s a load of foot traffic... not enough trash cans, etc. <br /><br />Don&#039;t like that 7 or 8 AM look to the area? Don&#039;t go to work so early. Or better still, go back to hoboken. You sound like you&#039;d be happier there. Or maybe the upper east side.<br /><br />I rather have old people that grew up or lived here for a damn long time here than some transplant that probably thinks 1800 is reasonable rent for a one bedroom around here.<br /><br />

				Leave already and spare us your pathetic attempts at attention-seeking behavior. It’s so tiring. This latest diatribe proves what an utter failure you are. You’ve been beaten by big-city living so run&nbsp; back home, tail between your legs, with our blessings. Just remember -- you couldn’t hack it and lashing out at those of us who can and do says more about you than us.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />And perhaps I’m in the minority for feeling this but everyone who has posted a reply addressing the ‘points’ without calling the OP on the language, context and tone of what he wrote, should really re-evaluate. <br /><br />I’m sorry, this is exactly the kind of sentiment that alienates longer-term residents from new arrivals. <br /><br />I look at it like this: <br /><br />If you don’t care to live here and wish you lived somewhere – none of my concern.<br />If you feel the Astoria and its residents are somehow beneath you – couldn’t care less. <br />If you think the neighborhood is crap -- well, you’re entitled to your opinion. <br /><br />And, if you want to say so to your lover, friends, family, co-workers, or therapist, whoever, then go knock yourself out. <br /><br />But when you publish an opinion in an open forum, on view for all the world to see, that uses the following words:<br /><br />Heebeegebies <br />horribly depressing and dreary<br />disgusting sidewalks <br />Sometimes Astoria looks to me like the neighborhood that time (and the economy) forgot. What a s___-hole.<br /><br />to describe something personal to me, that I care about, then I’ll call it as I see it.<br /><br />This was about more than dirty sidewalks and you all know it. <br /><br />There’s another poster on this forum, a native or long-term resident, who frequently makes comments about quality of life in the neighborhood, which I, and many others, construe as overly negative. His words were never as nasty as what was written here. Yet he is routinely called to task for what he says and how he says it. <br /><br />Why the double standard in this case?

				That section of Ditmars does get messy at times late at night or early morning. The same used to happen to parts of Steinway Street, but it&#039;s been noticeably cleaner the last 2-3 years. It&#039;s a quality of life issue that needs to be raised. There should be a more diligent cleaning routine, and/or more or bigger trash cans. Also, they should install stronger lights to keep vagrants from hanging around.

				I think there&#039;s a difference between saying &quot;that statement is immature&quot; and giving a reason why you have that opinion, and calling a person immature.<br /><br />Folks, you&#039;re welcome to debate ideas and disagree - but when name calling starts (you make it personal, or take it personal) the moderators will start suspending accounts. It&#039;s just that simple. It doesn&#039;t matter whether you&#039;ve got 1000 posts or just 3 - you will be suspended.<br /><br />And, I&#039;ll just throw it out there again that if anyone wants to take a stab at rewriting the board rules please feel free. :) For now this is the consensus we&#039;ve come to.

				I had that walk for a few months. I would have to agree that it isn&#039;t the most enjoyable when you factor in everything, but I wouldn&#039;t say my current walk is much better.

				So being that I&#039;ve been hearing so much about Ditmars trash, I guess I&#039;ve been paying more attention to it.&nbsp; This morning, I noticed how clean and free of debris Ditmars was.&nbsp; It was about 9am.&nbsp; I thought to myself, gee, it looks so clean!!&nbsp; As I got closer to the train, I encountered a street cleaner moving along a big garbage can and a broom.&nbsp; His jacket read Astoria Restoration, sponsored by Peter Vallone Jr.&nbsp; The street was clean where he had just been, and dirty where he was going.&nbsp; He was really cleaning the sidewalks.&nbsp; Perhaps if more people went to work at 9am instead of 7am, they would actually see this happening and would be less inclined to complain about the litter.&nbsp; It does actually get picked up!&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen this guy before but never paid attention.&nbsp; But with all recent bashing, he should be recognized.&nbsp; Thank you!!<br /><br />Thank you as well, Mr. Vallone.&nbsp; I do appreciate it!!

It is so dirty in the mornings and by the time I get back, it&#039;s often trashed again, too.

				It was absolutely filthy this morning.&nbsp; Normally, I run up 24th Ave, 23rd Ave and Ditmars.&nbsp; The other Avenues are extremely clean.&nbsp; Ditmars is filthy but this is normally at 6 AM.&nbsp; Not sure why there is so much trash everywhere.&nbsp; Newspapers, coffee cups, lottery tickets, metrocards etc.

				Broadway is pretty dirty in the morning as well.&nbsp; They need to ticket more to get folks to keep it cleaner or hire more folks to sweep.

				It is always pretty bad down where I live on Hoyt Ave.&nbsp; The litter that is thrown by the cars going onto the bridge, the garbage bags that are thrown into the grass by inconsiderate people and regular litterbugs make for a constant mess.&nbsp; I can sweep in front of my building and come back an hour or so later and it be messy again.<br /><br />We all seem to have the same problem.<br /><br />
