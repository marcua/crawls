				a new Japanese cuisine restaurant called WATAWA has recently [2 weeks ago] opened! &nbsp;its located at 33-10 Ditmars Blvd. &nbsp;and i gotta tell ya, its delicious! &nbsp;and cheap! &nbsp;i just had the best vegetable tempura and miso soup. &nbsp;their list of sushi is quite impressive. &nbsp;and the best part - they didnt mind me staying long after i finished my meal to just sit and have 2 pots of green tea while i wrote some letters to friends. <br />&nbsp;<br />it was a bit odd though to hear the party of seven behind me talking of how one of them has &quot;really strong toes!&quot; &nbsp; :shock:

				I must agree!! &nbsp;I ate at Watawa about 2 days after it opened (as it's a block away from me), and since then I've eaten there/ordered delivery probably 3 or 4 more times.<br /><br />I've had better miso soup, but the sushi was quite delicious and affordable.

				I did not care for the dressing on the salads that they used, but their sashimi was delicious. Nice and fresh and melts in your mouth goodness. From the food alone I would never guess that Chinese people run the place. I love the decor and atmosphere as well, very pleasing to the eyes and very relaxing.

				I really like Go Wasabi. &nbsp;Never actually eaten there, always had delivery. &nbsp;Before Go Wasabi, and now, I guess, this new place, the only sushi places were really scary bad, so I'm happy they've arrived.

				Go Wasabi's not bad for me, though not great either. I ate this monstrous sampler, sushi's and all. Maybe I just had a big appetite or maybe ,for the price, the serving wasn't large enough. What's cool though is they have a jazz night! That I gotta experience. I'm goin to head to Watawa soon and see if my expectations are met. Japanese cuisine (authentic) is really a tough one. I so love sake!

				Normally I am a picky person when it comes to Japanese cuisine, especially since I am married to a Japanese man. I usually will not eat Japanese food that is not prepared my someone who is Japanese, especially sashimi. However, being excited that there is Japanese resturants in Astoria I have gone to both even though neither are actually run by Japanese. I made an exception for these Astoria resturants that I don't for Manhatten ones. My experiences are below.<br /><br />Go Wasabi is ok. The staff is friendly enough and the fish is ok (though they have had off days were the fish didn't taste that good), but not perfect and tends to be on the small side for the price you pay. I like the fish at Watawa better. It just taste more fresh and hasn't let me down yet. Though there dressing on thier sald isnt that great and doesn't taste like a traditional Japanese dressing but then again niehter does Go Wasabi's either.

				Where is Wasabi -- the address? &nbsp;<br /><br />Also, there is one (not that good in my opinion) on 24th Avenue, right off of 31st Street but I don't the name of it. &nbsp;Has anybody been there?

				Go Wasabi is on the north-side of Ditmars between 29th and 31st Streets. I don't know the exact address... There is another one on Broadway, too, I think, but I am not entirely sure.

				I ordered raw fish from Tokyo and it was warm and slimy. I will never eat there again. Again though, Tokyo is not run by Japanese. What Astoria needs is a Japanese restaurant run by Japanese people.

				A friend and me stopped into Watawa to eat lunch. I ordered the Shrimp tempura lunch box and my friend got one of the other &nbsp;lunch boxes. At first my friend was disapoined with her lunch box beause they only gave her a couple pieces of beef in it. Mine came with a good &nbsp;amount of tempura. 2 1/2to 3 hours after eating lunch, I became very sick. I had terrible stomach cramps and had the chills one minute and was sweating terrible the next. I don't like to and try to aviod it but I ended up losing my cookies. I then took a nap for two hours and was woke up perfetly fine. My friend ate everything that I did for lunch except the tempura and never got sick. My husband went back to them to complain abut me getting sick later that evening and the only thing they had to say was &quot;oh the shrimp must have been bad.&quot; &nbsp;:evil: &nbsp;That's their whole apology. It sounded like to me they knew the shrimp was bad and maybe thats why my portion of tempura looked big. &nbsp;to say the least I WILL NOT eat there again. I will go to go Wasabi from now on. They seamed to improve the quality of their food.

				I'm a big fan of Watawa. &nbsp;I love everything. &nbsp;The presentation is fantastic, the staff is pleasant, the space is cool. &nbsp;I'm usually there once a week at a minimum. &nbsp;<br /><br />I haven't had any bad experiences.<br /><br />But, in the interest of full disclosure, I haven't eaten the shrimp either.<br /><br />Knowing the risks, I doubt any restaurant would knowingly serve spoiled food -- especially not questionable seafood.

				I used to be a big fan of Watawa too. My husband and I go there often, at least we did. So often that sometimes he would chat it up with one of the chefs and they would give us free things to try. After getting sick from them however, I will never go back.

				Just wanted to let you know, after that post, a manager from Watawa contacted us with an apology letter, offering free dinner for two. &nbsp;<br /><br />Of course we took up the offer. &nbsp;And we have been back there regularly ever since. &nbsp;I think the incident my wife described was purely coincidental.<br /><br />Nick
