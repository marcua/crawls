				<strong>Anna Nicole Smith dies in Florida hospital<br />Former model found unresponsive in Florida hotel room<br /><br />•BREAKING NEWS<br />MSNBC staff and news service reports<br />Updated: less than 1 minute ago<br /><br />Anna Nicole Smith died Thursday after collapsing at a hotel and being being rushed to the hospital, one of her lawyers said.<br /><br />Smith collapsed in her room at the Hard Rock Cafe and Casino in Hollywood, Fla., and was rushed to a hospital on Thursday. A Hollywood, Fla., fire department spokesman told MSNBC TV that the actress was unresponsive when the rescue unit arrived on the scene and had been intubated. Smith was transported to Memorial Regional Hospital shortly after 2 p.m. EST and her attorney confirmed that she had died nearly an hour later.<br /><br />On Tuesday, Smith and the diet products company TrimSpa Inc., for which she is a spokeswoman, were sued in a class-action lawsuit alleging their marketing of a weight loss pill is false or misleading.<br /><br />Smith also was order by a judge to have baby daughter undergo paternity testing. The test is being sought by Smith&#39;s former boyfriend Larry Birkhead, who claims he is the father of Dannielynn Hope Marshall Stern. She was born Sept. 7 in the Bahamas.<br /><br />Less than a week after the birth of her daughter, Smith&#39;s 20-year-old son Daniel died in her hospital room while visiting Smith after the birth. An coroner&#39;s report ruled the death was caused by an overdose of anti-depressants and methadone.<br /><br />Smith married Texas oil tycoon J. Howard Marshall II in 1994, when she was 26 and he was 89. He died the following year.<br /><br />She then feuded with Marshall’s son, Pierce Marshall, over her entitlement to the tycoon’s estate before he died in June at the age of 67.<br /><br />In the long-running dispute, Smith had won a $474 million judgment, which was later cut to about $89 million and eventually reduced to zero. In May, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Smith could continue to pursue the fortune in federal courts in California despite a Texas state court ruling that Marshall’s youngest son was the sole heir.<br /><br />This story is still developing.

				It really is sad. Not surprising given her unrelenting drug addiction, though.<br /><br />I feel especially sorry for her new baby daughter, who has no mother, brother, and whose paternity remains in question. Already off to a rough start, poor little thing&nbsp; :oops:

				I just think it is weird that her son died and they never really knew why and now she dies and again they don&#39;t know why.&nbsp; My theory..poison.&nbsp; Someone poisoned them for whatever reason and unless you know what to look for in blood test, they might never find it.

				Her son died from a drug overdose. Or rather, an unfortunate mixing of drugs. From CNN.com:<br />&quot;Smith&#39;s son, Daniel Wayne Smith, died at age 20 just days after the birth of Smith&#39;s daughter. Pathologist Cyril Wecht said a lethal dose of methadone and antidepressants caused cardiac dysrhythmia, leading to his death.&quot;<br /><br />

				From what I have read, they think that was the cause, but it was never 100% conclusive

				39.<br /><br />I think her lawyer/boyfriend//husbandSvengali Howard K. Stern had her murdered, and had the 20 year-old son poisoned as well. Strong motive: he&#39;s now in line to inherit her cash, or at least hold it in &quot;trust&quot; for the baby girl. If it&#39;s ever established that the baby isn&#39;t his, don&#39;t be surprised if something horrible befalls her in the near future...<br /><br />Sweet dreams.

				I read in the news today that yes she originally won a huge inheritance but then it was cut down to about 80 million and then down to nothing. She was free to try again though.&nbsp; So besides her modeling stuff I don&#39;t think she had millions and millions anywhere.&nbsp; <br /><br />Probably a messed up life and couldn&#39;t find her way out of it.&nbsp; It&#39;s a shame.
