				This&nbsp; is&nbsp; an awful story, especially for Mrs. Edwards, who is suffering from terminal&nbsp; cancer. My interest&nbsp; in the story is not what&nbsp; he did&nbsp; to his&nbsp; family, but, the &#039;incestuous&#039; relationship&nbsp; between many in media&nbsp; and politicians, most of whom happen to be on the political&nbsp; Left. Just because&nbsp; someone makes&nbsp; a documentary, or&nbsp; film, does&nbsp; not make it the whole story and many times&nbsp; it&#039;s very distorted&nbsp; from reality. As&nbsp; for&nbsp; the details, well, let&#039;s&nbsp; just say, If I was&nbsp; ever lucky enough to meet someone that&nbsp; I loved so much that&nbsp; I would have children, I wouldn&#039;t do this&nbsp; to them. But, then again I&#039;m not a sleazy attorney&nbsp; and politician.&nbsp; :-(<br /><br /><br /><br />http://netscape.compuserve.com/news/story.jsp?floc=FF-APO-1131&amp;idq=/ff/story/0001%2F20080808%2F1914070706.htm&amp;sc=1131&amp;floc=NW_1-T

				How about the mixing of church and state. Newt Gingrich divorcing his 1st wife while she is in the hospital with cancer so he can run off and marry a choir girl from their family church?&nbsp; Tsk tsk.&nbsp; Just because people spout Jesus and Piety does not make it the whole picture and reality.<br /><br />As for Edwards, what a schmuck.&nbsp; That woman was never a film maker until he paid for her to film.&nbsp; He was just giving her money under false pretenses.&nbsp; I think this is more about cheating than about the media. <br /><br />&nbsp;We could always talking about the Bush family F*&amp;*((# Murdock who pays the whore O&#039;reilly to flame partisan lies to distort the truth and sway the public with angry soundbites to create an antagonistic hateful society.&nbsp; Now that is a good example of incestuous relations between people in the media and the political right.&nbsp;

				I did a quick google search and found different percentages for how many married people have affairs - the numbers range from 20% to 50%. Both numbers are kind of high. It shouldn&#039;t be a total shocker when we find out that one of our politicians has cheated. I&#039;m not condoning it, but things happen. <br /><br />I hate it that we waste so much energy on our politicians&#039; sex lives.

				I find it more interesting than the affair that the woman doesn&#039;t want a paternity test for her daughter. Not that it&#039;s anyone&#039;s business and I&#039;m not particularly interested in any &quot;politician has affair&quot; story (aside from Spitzer, but that was just ridiculous), but I imagine she will want to know who her dad is at some point, whether it is or isn&#039;t Edwards. In other words, I wonder if we&#039;ll find out several years down the road that the daughter has a paternity test done herself.

				I must admit that I&#039;m disappointed in Edwards. I expected better from him, especially in regards to being faithful to his wife, even if she were in remission at the time. On the other hand, what does this have to do with his ability to do a good job in public office should he be elected or appointed a cabinet position? We have so many people in high positions today who are in bed with oil corporations and big pharmaceutical companies and the military industrial complex, and they&#039;re f***ing all the citizens, and here we all are focusing instead on an extramarital affair by a politician, who isn&#039;t even currently running for anything.&#160;&#160;

The majority of them are featuring the international scandal of 10 year old Chinese girl lip synching the opening credits of the Olympics. To them, apparently, this is more important than war in the Caucuses.<br /><br />The OP specifically stated that this was about a media double standard. I agree with him on this for a few reasons.<br />John Edwards was always a no accomplishment scumbag who was created by mass media who shared his craven &quot;two Americas&quot; meme. It is a narrative that they love to promote. Than they portrayed this vapid POS as a loving family man. And when presented with uncorroborated evidence of his extracurricular activities they did not attempt to corroborate, even though he was running for president.<br /><br />I agree that people cheat. <br /><br />But John Edwards it not a lying scumbag parasite because he cheated on his wife. He cheated on his wife because he is a lying scumbag parasite.<br /><br />It was the media who actively portrayed him as something different, and they have a responsibility to portray him accurately when they run out of excuses.

				I don&#039;t get why you&#039;re spending so much time calling him a scumbag and POS in this context. <br /><br />Bush did coke, Clinton got some from an intern, McCain dumped his wife for a rich daddy&#039;s girl barbie doll- they all do it. Even on the local level: Spitzer, Patterson, McGreavy, Fossella, etc. What does it matter to their office/candidacy?<br />Just goes to show how ignorant so much of our fellow citizens are that they base their voting on crap like this. If a candidate has a stellar record as far as what he/she does, yet is an adulterer, then all of a sudden, they move aside and let a second-rate candidate in. It&#039;s so pathetic. <br /><br />If this is the worst thing our politicians do, I could care less. As long as these things they do don&#039;t affect me, I don&#039;t give a crap- I&#039;d vote for a transexual adultering Muslim former pothead as long as he or she gets the job done and done right.

He didn&#039;t marry again, till some&nbsp; years&nbsp; later. Try getting some real news, not from some far left web sites. McCain has aknowledged he should have handled&nbsp; his disintergrating marriage better, but, his former wife&nbsp; is&nbsp; supporting his run. This&nbsp; &#039;Pretty Boy&#039; has no excuse, and he did&nbsp; it in full view&nbsp; of the press, who rolled&nbsp; over&nbsp; cause&nbsp; he is &#039;on their&nbsp; side.&#039;<br /><br />Edwards PAC, the One American Committee, which was set up to fight &#039;poverty&#039;, spent $114,000 for the production of several short Web-based videos. <br /><br />The videos were produced in 2006 by Rielle Hunter; the same woman with whom Edwards has admitted having an affair. <br /><br />Hunter reportedly pitched the Web video idea to Edwards in a New York City bar. <br /><br />IMDB shows Hunter’s professions as writer, actress and producer, having had written, acted and produced a short film, &#039;Billy Bob and Them,&#039; under her own production company, R. Hunter Films. <br /><br />One key question is, Why would Edwards direct his PAC to pay an arguably inflated price to a relatively inexperienced individual to have her work on such an important project? <br /><br />It may turn out that Hunter was paid a far larger sum.&nbsp; Fred Baron, a Dallas lawyer and former campaign finance chairman for Edwards, gave money in the $15,000-a-month ballpark to Hunter. <br /><br />Edwards claims he had no knowledge of Baron’s payments and that he learned about the cash given to Hunter from the press. Hunter now lives in a rented home that is worth several million dollars. The residence is located in a gated section of Montecito, an exclusive area of Santa Barbara, Calif. <br /><br />Andrew Young (a top Edwards aide who claimed to be the father of Hunter’s child) and his wife are reportedly roommates of Hunter at the Montecito home. <br /><br />Hunter and business partner Mimi Hockman apparently set up Midline Groove Productions in 2006 to produce the Edwards Web videos. <br /><br />Midline Groove’s Web site has since been pulled from the Internet, although Hockman is still shown as owner of the company’s domain, midlinegroove.com. <br /><br />The videos, too, disappeared from the Internet, only to resurface via an anonymous posting on YouTube. <br /><br />Midline Groove Productions was described on its now missing site as &#039;committed to projects that reveal truth.&#039;<br /><br />In a 2007 interview with the TV show “Extra,” Hunter shared her feelings about working with Edwards. “He was very authentic. He was inspirational to me,” Hunter said. “I was around him a lot. It was great. We went to Africa. The whole experience was life altering for me.” <br /><br />Of course none of this has anything to do with the relationship of Hollywood and &#039;arts&#039; community, which was the main thrust of this thread.

				McCain&#039;s first wife was given a huge settlement.&nbsp; That&#039;s why she kept quiet. Much like the woman in the Edwards excitement.&nbsp; It is awfully nice of John McCain to say that he handled it poorly. I guess that makes it all righty then.&nbsp; And to deny McCains behavior and facts of his first marriage being destroyed by his cheating and deeds is a poor way to rewrite history.&nbsp; And we all know he came back a broken man and hero. Didn&#039;t need to be said but I guess hero can do anything if that&#039;s what you are trying to say.&nbsp; <br /><br />As for Newt, the an is a scumbag of the highest order. There is no way to explain away his behavior.&nbsp; But I am sure there are some who would defend him to the end of time.&nbsp; But you know his ilk, say preach one thing to the masses and do the moral opposite with your Cheney&nbsp; :wink: :wink:.&nbsp;
