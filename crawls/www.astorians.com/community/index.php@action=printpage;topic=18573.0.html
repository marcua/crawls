				Glad to hear about your company and you&#039;re right, it&#039;s an idea long past due! Before I could recommend your company to anyone, though, I&#039;d need to know more information. How many bikes do you have available for rental? What kind are they? What condition are they in? How many different sizes do you have? Do you do adjustments/repairs on-site? Etc...

				<br />Hi Jayladdin!<br /><br />I appreciate your interest and am happy to answer your questions.<br /><br />Due to the fact that we are a start-up company, we first want to see what the demand will be like.<br />So right now, we have 10 bikes which are adult bikes, (woman &amp; men) however, if a booking requires a childrens bike or baby seat etc. we will make sure we can provide these items.<br />Basically, we will never say &quot;no&quot; to any requests.<br /><br />The bikes we have are maintained on a regular basis and are kept in good condition. They are not older then 1-2 years and were barely used.<br /><br />Adjustments and repairs will not offered on-site unless it is for one of our own bikes.<br /><br />I hope I was able to answer all of your questions. If you need any more information feel free to contact me.<br /><br />Have a great weekend!<br /><br />Ildi

				Good luck with your business! I saw your post this morning and then your sidewalk message on Ditmars this afternoon :) I&#039;ve got my own bike, but it&#039;s nice to know about you so I can recommend you to others.

				I don&#039;t know if this is a weird question or not (I&#039;ve never rented a bike in the city), but do you have locks available for rental as well? I could see myself renting a bike for a half day and stopping for lunch or something somewhere :)

				I have a weird question as well - are you operating out of a storefront or an apartment?&nbsp; I was looking for a storefront while dropping off my dry cleaning this morning but 35-07 Ditmars is my Vet and not a bike rental place.

There are railings for you to run your bike on, but it definitely interrupts the flow a little. However, you get a great downhill ride onto Randall&#039;s Island, and the ride fonto Ward&#039;s Island is very pretty.

				<br />Hello to All!<br /><br />If I am responding late to some of your questions, I apologize, I am new to this blog and only noticed the questions today. <br /><br />For those searching for an actual bike store, you will not find us. <br />Because we are a start-up, we are operating Ride &amp; Roll out of my apartment for the time being.<br />Hopefully by next year we will be renting a space in the area.<br /><br />We are located right next to the Vet, I have put out Ride &amp; Roll flyers on one of the windows, if you look up you will see them.<br /><br />To be able to rent all you need is a valid ID and to sign our waiver.<br />For more information you can go to our website, www.rideandrollastoria.com, or our facebook page, http://www.facebook.com/?ref=logo#!/pages/Astoria-NY/Ride-Roll-Bike-Rental/127199337309069?ref=ts&amp;ajaxpipe=1&amp;__a=8 , where we have a few pictures of our bikes posted.<br /><br />Helmets and locks are free with each rental.<br /><br />Again, sorry for the late response, I will be more diligent from now on, promise! :)

				iharko<br />Congratulations on the business getting off the ground!<br /><br />Before I had a baby I used to ride quite a bit - I&#039;m thinking of renting a bike with a babyseat to see if I like the feel. (or maybe too stressful on our streets) <br /><br />You might want to post (either on your website or here) about some ride suggestions.&nbsp; People who don&#039;t ride don&#039;t have any idea where to go on a bike.&nbsp; Actually there&#039;s an old thread here about ride suggestions that you might want to find if you&#039;re not that familiar with biking from an Astoria base.&nbsp; You could include an approximate number of hours the ride would take so that people could estimate the cost of their fun.&nbsp; <br /><br />good luck with the business!!
