				hi, there. <br /><br />i'm doing a school project involving a community assessment of astoria. And I was wondering if any of you know of any issues/problem/concerns/needs of the community in Astoria. it can be as specific or broad as you like (from lacking resources to stopping graffiti, it can be anything). as well as any recommendations for improvements in any areas. <br /><br />if any of you astorians can help me out, i'd be oh so grateful. <br /><br />thanks a bunch! <br /><br />-linda

				I second that. &nbsp;A bookstore would be great around the 31st/Ditmars area. &nbsp;Also, a CD store.<br /><br />Although it's probably better for my wallet that there aren't any. &nbsp;:)

				There was, actually, a very nice bookstore on 31st between Ditmars and 23rd, but it went out of business a few years ago. I think that says something about the mentality of Astoria, eh? ;)

				I would add: traffic, TLC parking and pedestrian incidents (I was hit by a car U-turning, while on my bike) on the block of 31st st, btwn Ditmars and 23rd Ave.<br /><br />Also, the police not patrolling public alleys in the neighborhood, and dealers and hoods knowing it!<br /><br />Also, need for public tack-up message boards (like in college towns) on the corners of Ditmars and 31st.<br /><br />Also, Pool improvements in terms of staff and facilities at the Astoria Park pool.<br /><br />Also... I forget.
