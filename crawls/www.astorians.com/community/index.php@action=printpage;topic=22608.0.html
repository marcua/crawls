				my neighbor has this incredible friendly and beauty of a (young) boxer. the dog isn&#039;t the problem, per se, but the owners are.<br /><br /><br />see, they leave this poor dog out in their (fenced-in) backyard for hours at a time (usually from about 10am until mid-late evening) and once the sun starts going down, she wants no part of being out there anymore.&nbsp; she will combine barking and crying for hours at a time.&nbsp; i feel so bad for her that i want to go into her yard and bring her into my house.<br /><br /><br />unfortunately, i have a large (old) dog too and i&#039;m not sure it&#039;s so feasible to have them together on the same side of the fence.&nbsp; through the course of the day, i try to talk to the dog or pet her or give her treats (give her some comfort), but it&#039;s not enough to make her happy for long.&nbsp; i feel so bad for her.<br /><br /><br />i do think that it&#039;s extremely neglectful to do this to a dog, but other than that, i see no other signs of abuse.&nbsp; in their own way, i think they do love this dog.&nbsp; i mean the dogs that they used to have were rarely in the house as well, but those dogs were ok with it, while this one is definitely not.<br /><br /><br />i haven&#039;t confronted the neighbor about this exactly.&nbsp; i do know that the mother of the house didn&#039;t want the dog, but the adult daughter did and was the one who got her.<br /><br /><br />i don&#039;t know what to do or even if there is anything that i can do for her. i mean i know it&#039;s their prerogative to do what they want, but at the same time, this poor animal is not happy a lot of the time and that in turn bothers the hell out of me.

				Be careful, taking the dog might get you in all sorts of trouble, trespassing, and dognapping (?).<br /><br />It doesn&#039;t sound like the dog is getting abused, it is just sitting outside while it prefers company. Do they let it indoors at night? <br /><br />

				I thought there was a noise ordinance about dog barking?&nbsp; I think that if it&#039;s continuous for a certain amount of minutes you can call the city about it.&nbsp;
