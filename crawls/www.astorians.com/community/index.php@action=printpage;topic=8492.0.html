				I read the boards all the time but have never posted here before - however something just happened to me that I thought people should look out for.<br /><br />Right after I got home from work today my doorbell rang. I answered it and there was a man with a woman that looked like it could be his daughter. He said:<br /><br />&quot;Hello, we are from the New York State Gas and Electric Corporation. We want to make sure that you will not be affected by Con Edison&#039;s 34 percent rate hike. I need to see your Con Edison bill.&quot;<br /><br />I told the guy no thank you and he asked me why. I told him that I wouldn&#039;t show it to them and he said ok and left. He never showed or offered to show ID the entire time.<br /><br />This totally seemed liked a scam. I&#039;m concerned because there are a lot of elderly people on my block (42nd between Bway &amp; 31st) that could fall for this.<br /><br />I called the 114th to report it and they weren&#039;t very helpful at first. The woman who answered the phone asked me if I could call back in 20 minutes! I said I really wanted to report this - she put me on hold for awhile, then finally I got to speak to an officer, who said they&#039;d check it out (whatever that means). <br /><br />I suppose it&#039;s possible that these people are legit, but my gut was screaming fraud the whole time. Has anyone else encountered something like this in the neighborhood recently?

				I&#039;m not sure that&#039;s the company they said they were from. New York State Gas and Electric Corporation sounded a bit too generic to me to be legit. <br /><br />However, I tried calling the number you gave me to ask them if they have people going door to door in Queens and got put on eternal hold...so I googled the number. The company whose number you gave out only operates in Western NY State it seems...

				Nobody is going to knock on your door for your benefit - only their benefit.&nbsp; It must be some type of scam w/ kickbacks for themselves.&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />(example: Change your provider w/ the info. you provide.&nbsp; You will get locked into a contract w/ a higher rate.)

				NYSEG is the company that monopolized the area when I lived upstate.&nbsp; The company merged and became Niagara Mohawk, so technically, NYSEG no longer is a company.&nbsp; And even more so, Niagara Mohawk is now part of National Grid.

				Last saturday, I was walking out of my apartment and over heard one of my neighbors talking to some one at their door.&nbsp; They said they were with Nielsen&#039;s tv ratings.&nbsp; They asked to come in and talk to do a survey.&nbsp; My neighbor let them in...&nbsp; &nbsp;Anyone know if the Nielsen&#039;s people make house calls?&nbsp; Is this some sort of a scam?&nbsp;

				FYI, the &quot;Gas and Electric&quot; scammers were out on 35th St. today. I said, &quot;Buzz the super for that&quot;; they replied, &quot;The super don&#039;t pay gas and electric.&quot; Scam. But some rube let them into the building anyway. Watch out.

				I think we had one yesterday on 21st Ave.&nbsp; Our bell rang as we were sitting down to dinner so we didn&#039;t answer when we saw a girl on the front steps with a clipboard.&nbsp; She only rang once but stood there for about 15 minutes as if we were going to magically appear.<br /><br />Who solicits people on a federal holiday?&nbsp; That seemed so random to us.
