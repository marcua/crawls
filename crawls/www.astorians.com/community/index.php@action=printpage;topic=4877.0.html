				What happened to we were going to eat lunch in Flushing?&nbsp; Oh, yeah, the power failure.&nbsp; That was a while ago, though!&nbsp; And according to that article, Flushing is still there.

				Flushing has the best Korean food...I love Kum Gang San...you get a bunch of free appetizers before your meal comes.&nbsp; &nbsp;I always joke that they are probably left overs from a previous day because they give so much of it.&nbsp; They have another one in the city...but imho...the one in Flushing is way better...and there&#39;s free parking!

				We ordered three small dishes and one big dish (for two people). &nbsp;The small dishes (they might call them appetizers on the menu) were: celery with dried tofu strips, eggplant with red peppers, and cold sesame noodles. &nbsp;The big dish was rice cakes with vegetables. &nbsp;It&#39;s a great menu for vegetarians, too - lots of options. &nbsp;Sichuanese cuisine isn&#39;t easy to find in restaurants, and I&#39;ve had it before, but NEVER THIS GOOD!<br /><br />And then you can go to the Hong Kong supermarket and buy mochis. &nbsp; :-) &nbsp;

				My son loves mochis...he discovered them when we were having dinner at a Japanese restaurant.&nbsp; I forgot what they were called so I told him they were <em>froggy eggs</em>....to this day we still call them f<em>roggy eggs</em>...from time to time I actually slip up and order &quot;froggy eggs&quot; LOL!
