				I know that everyone here is psyched about the coming Obama administration.&nbsp; But I would like to see what you guys think about what Gail Collins proposes in her latest column: http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/22/opinion/22collins.html<br /><br />My assumption is that although most of you can&#039;t wait for Obama to take the reigns, you will have the same problems with her idea as I do.&nbsp; Perhaps she has never heard of an inconvenient little thing called the Constitution?&nbsp; I think maybe Gail Collins wrote this piece in the company of Tom Collins.

				I don&#039;t know why people would read the column, literally.&nbsp; For whatever you might think of her, Gail Collins is in the Opinion section of the NY Times and that piece, as well as the link below is more of an attempt at humor then a serious debate.&nbsp; <br /><br />http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/08/opinion/08collins.html<br /><br />I have no doubt that the Times writers and editor lean to the Left, but I didn&#039;t hear anyone on the Right complain about their objectivity with the Judith Miller debacle http://articles.latimes.com/2005/oct/18/nation/na-nyt18.&nbsp; You might recall that all of those so-called liberal newspapers, e.g. Post, were involved and journalists even went to jail.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				Obama has made it very clear Bush is still our president. &nbsp;He&#039;s also made it very clear that he knows there is no easy fix and it will be long and hard. &nbsp;And that he will make mistakes. &nbsp;He&#039;s said so a number of times publicly. &nbsp;The challenges he faces are enormous and I am happy he&#039;s honest, and hard at work assembling a cabinet and plan of action so that he can hit the ground running. &nbsp;<br /><br />As for Gail, I don&#039;t know who she is, and yeah, her column was very stupid. &nbsp;I did look at some of the comments and not all take her seriously. &nbsp; I think we&#039;re pretty much in agreement.

				I&#039;m not a fan of Collins&#039;s opinion pieces but she&#039;s not the only person wishing for a hastened end to the Bush era. Tom Friedman essentially made the same point in his last op-ed column:<br /><br />www.nytimes.com/2008/11/23/opinion/23friedman.html?em (http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/23/opinion/23friedman.html?em)<br /><br />

				I never really enjoy Gail Collins these days, I used to really enjoy her work, but the past few years it&#039;s left me lacking.<br /><br />Tom Friedman, Bob Herbert and Frank Rich, however, they&#039;re columnists and brilliant, at least in my opinion.

They depend upon someone, other than voter, determining the intent of the voter. The facts are clear. Bush had more votes than Gore in Florida as the laws of Florida were written. As for the popular vote, it is wholly irrelevent. You may wish the laws were different. You may even petition your representative to change the law. Hell, you may even run for congress someday and start a drive to change the constitution. But as it stands, Al gore lost. All the rejected ballots in the world won&#039;t change that.
