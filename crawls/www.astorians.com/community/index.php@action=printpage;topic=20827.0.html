				My wife and I, and a group of our friends have been Astoria residents for 3-4 years now, and came up with the idea to &quot;eat Astoria through the alphabet.&quot; Basically this means every month we go to a different restaurant, and each time the restauarant starts with the next letter of the alphabet we are up to. We want to do some classy and expensive places, some dirt cheap delicious grub, and everything in between.<br /><br />We started our journey with the letter A this past Sunday and had an amazing meal at &quot;Astor Room&quot; by Kaufman Astoria Studios. Up next is B, and so far the favorite is Bareburger. But we vote before a final decision is made, and I thought good old Astorians.com would be a good place to post updates and have people give suggestions. Keep in mind we are looking for a place a little less expensive than Astor Room, but does anyone have a good suggestion for an Astoria restaurant that begins with the letter &quot;B&quot;????<br /><br />&nbsp;:-)

				Are you following classic alphabetization rules or going straight on the name? I would recommend Il Bambino if the former.<br /><br />If you want cheap, then maybe Bohemian Beer Garden would be a good bet - it should *knock on wood* finally be nice outside by next month after all, and you cannot get more iconic Astoria than that.<br /><br />

				Liman, that is a fun idea. Hope you share other letters you try.<br /><br />There a number of B places, have you tried most of <br /><br />Bohemian, Bangkok Tasty, Bel Aire diner, <strong>Bistro 33, Brick,</strong><br /><br />[BZ Grill, Burger King]<br /><br /><br /><br />http://www.urbanspoon.com/n/3/200/New-York/Astoria-restaurants<br /><br /><br />Would Cavo, be on your list later?<br /><br />[Cronin &amp; Phelan&#039;s]<br /><br />And you can look forward to Zenon Taverna.

				There&#039;s also Blackbird on 30th ave, but I would say that either Bareburger or the Beer Garden would be a better choice. There&#039;s also Bel Aire Diner and Bistro 33. I think of all of those, Bistro 33 would get my vote.<br /><br />Because we&#039;d like to help you (or at least I would) here&#039;s the alphabet and I&#039;ve started filling it in.&nbsp; Hopefully others can lend a hand. I can&#039;t be certain that the restaurants in the y&#039;s and z&#039;s will still be open in 2 years. <br /><br />B: Bareburger, Bel Aire Diner, Bohemian hall, Blackbirds, Bistro 33<br />C: Christo&#039;s Steakhouse, Crave Shack, Cafe Bar<br />D: Dillinger&#039;s, Domaine&#039;s (LIC, because I&#039;m expansive), Dekko Cafe<br />E: Elia&#039;s Corner<br />F: Fratelli&#039;s<br />G:<br />H:<br />I: Il Bambino<br />J: JJ&#039;s Asian Fusion<br />K: Kabab Cafe, King of Falafel and Schwarma<br />L: L&#039;Artise, L&#039;incontro (although maybe that moves to C, since I think it&#039;s Cafe)<br />M: Mombar, Michaels, MexiQ, Mojave<br />N: <br />O: Oceano<br />P: Petey&#039;s Burger, Pachenga Patterson, Piccola Veneztia<br />Q: Queens Comfort, Queens Kickshaw<br />R: Rose and Joe&#039;s<br />S: Sabry&#039;s, Seva, 718, Sunswick<br />T: Telly&#039;s Taverna<br />U:<br />V: Vesta<br />W:<br />X:<br />Y:<br />Z: Zenon Taverna

				We never actually made a parameter that we are going to places EXCLUSIVE to astoria. That being said, Bareburger is a restaurant started in Astoria, by an Astoria resident, so I would say it is an Astoria restaurant for sure. <br /><br />Our goal is to find places in Astoria that are good, but if we all voted for Burger King for B then thats where we would go. Not that we ever would have voted for Burger King.... just sayin....

				Just wanted to update everyone on our Bareburger experience last month.<br />&nbsp;<br />Our group (there were 8 of us) had all been there before, but it was excellent nonetheless. I had a delicious Bareburger Supreme with fries, and for the first time ever tried a Bareburger Milkshake. <br />&nbsp;<br />I consider myself a connoissuer of milkshakes, and let me say this is a MUST try if you like shakes. It was silky smooth, and tasted so fresh. I went with the classic Strawberry, but there were some interesting other flavors that sounded great as well.<br />&nbsp;<br />We all loved our meal, and I DEFINITELY recommend Bareburger if you have not tried it yet.<br />&nbsp;<br />Letter &quot;C&quot; should be coming up in the next week or so. I think the group wants to try some Creperie I am not familiar with, but I will let you know when the official nominees are out.<br />&nbsp;<br />Feel free to suggest your own ideas for a &quot;C&quot; restaurant!<br />&nbsp;<br />-Andrew

				Bueno. I think most would agree with your love for the shakes, and probably the burgers too.<br />&nbsp;<br />Would Cafe Triskell fall under C or T. I believe it is a tiny place.<br />Cronin &amp; Phelan comes to mind. But to be honest, almost never go back there.<br />&nbsp;<br />Will look forward to your future letter adventures.&nbsp; &nbsp; :tongue: <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;

				So after procrastinating worse than a college student with a paper to write, my wife has finally organized the next letter in the alphabet- letter C.<br /><br />Some of the options put forth to the group were Cavo, Canz, Chicken Festival, Christos Steak House, and Cevabdzinica Sarajevo, but ultimately the majority ruled that our letter C restaurant will be........ drumroll please....<br /><br />CAFE TRISKELL!<br /><br />Anyone been there? Any suggestions on what to get, what kind of place it is, etc?<br /><br />Very excited to continue the alphabet!<br /><br />-Andrew

				I love Cafe Triskell! The frites are yummy and any of the crepes are good. I especially like the simple dessert crepe flavored with lemon and sugar. The boule of hard cider is great. Actually, everything I&#039;ve had there has been really delicious. It&#039;s a tiny place, and gets crowded fast. Eating sooner than later in the evening is something to consider.

				So we went to an impromtu brunch, and were planning on hitting up MexiQ for the unlimited drinks, but it was a 2 hour wait for a table of 8. We ended up going up the block to DiWine, and quickly realized that the letter D was accidentally being taken care of!<br />&nbsp;<br />The food was delicious, and I recommend the pizzas for anyone who goes. The service was verrrry slow, and it hampered our ability to get the most out of the unlimited drink deal. I don&#039;t blame the wait staff, as they were extremely crowded, but I do blame the manager. It was packed, and they had waiters running to delis to buy more orange juice. <br />&nbsp;<br />If DiWine is not too crowded, or if they have enough staff, its a great place to go. Just be careful- you miguht have to wait 30 minutes for a drink if you go for brunch at 1pm on a beautiful day.<br />&nbsp;<br />Here is a recap of our tour so far:<br />&nbsp;<br />A- ASTOR ROOM <br />B- BAREBURGER<br />C- CAFE TRISKELL<br />D- DIWINE<br />&nbsp;<br />Up next, letter E!

				In a strange twist, we were on our way to go to LETTER E last night, and were going to do the tapas place &quot;El Boqueron&quot; on 34th Ave. Well, unbeknownst to us El Boqueron is closed every Monday in the summer, so our plans were halted.<br />&nbsp;<br />We were all starving, and started wandering the neighborhood looking for a replacement.<br />&nbsp;<br />In the end, Five Napkin Burger found us and sucked us in, so we decided to temporarily skip E and go right to F.<br />&nbsp;<br />I had never been to Five Napkin (I tried to go once to one in Manhattan last year but it was like a 2 hour wait), and I must say I was a big fan.<br />&nbsp;<br />The price may have been more than a typical suburban burger joint, but I was not bothered at all by the cost. The decor inside gives the place a feel of a nice restaurant, and it&#039;s on par with other &quot;fad&quot; burger restaurants. I had a bacon cheeseburger (which was quite filling), and split tater tots, french fries, and fried pickles with the table. A few people got a beer, and the rest of us got sodas, and it came to 23 dollars per person. Really not bad.<br />&nbsp;<br />The quality of food was very good. The fries were good (nothing great), the tater tots were awesome (they are like mini knishes!), and the fried pickles had pastrami and sour kraut in them so... enough said. My burger was very good as well. I really have no complaints.<br />&nbsp;<br />I went into this meal expecting it to be tasty, but expecting a lot of the negative reviews to resonate with me. On the contrary, I was pleasantly surprised and would definitely go back to Five Napkin Burger.<br />&nbsp;<br />We will go back to the letter E soon, but for now we have moved on and knocked off letter F.<br />&nbsp;<br />Here is a recap of the letters:<br />&nbsp;<br />A- ASTOR ROOM <br />B- BAREBURGER<br />C- CAFE TRISKELL<br />D- DIWINE<br />E- ????<br />F- FIVE NAPKIN BURGER

				Cafe Triskell was really good- it was absolutely pouring rain on the evening we went- as a result (I think) the place was totally empty except for us- this is always a weird feeling, but whatever.<br />&nbsp;<br />Also, I was feeling a little sick that night, so it was going to be tough for me to love the food. My dinner crepe was hame and cheese with spinach, and it was fair. My appetizer was a french onion soup that was good, but not quite as good as the menu hyped it up to be.<br />&nbsp;<br />Then we ordered dessert crepes, and this is where Cafe Triskell really shined through IMO. I had some of my buddy&#039;s crepe which had peanut butter, nutella, and bananas in it. DAYUM! It was awesome. I wish I had just gone and gotten dessert.<br />&nbsp;<br />The waitress was very pleasant and the service was good, but then again if you are the ONLY table being served you would expect nothing less, right?<br />&nbsp;<br />Overall, I was satisfied, though not thoroughly wowed by Cafe Triskell. Again, inclement weather and a stomach ache put me in a bad spot going into the meal, so I would be willing to give it another meal for sure, but of all the places we have been so far Triskell may have been my least favorite. That, however, is more of a testament to how good everything else has been that we&#039;ve tried.<br />&nbsp;<br />If you go to Cafe Triskell, make sure you try the dessert- its money!
