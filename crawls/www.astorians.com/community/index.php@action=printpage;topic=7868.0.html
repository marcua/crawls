				I am wondering if anyone is interested in starting a working moms mothers group in Astoria. I know there is a very active Stay at Home moms group, but I would like to network with other working moms in the neighborhood who are working full time. Plus, it would be nice to be part of a community of other moms since it does feel like more and more families with young children are moving into the hood. I just would love to meet other women facing the work/life/mommy balance issues I am.<br /><br />If interested, reply. Maybe we can launch something.

				Do I count as working if I work part-time? Because I&#039;m definitely not a stay at home mom. And I would love some neighborhood support - none of my friends with kids, working or otherwise, live in the area.&nbsp; Let me know! Thanks. Rachel.

				just an FYI.&nbsp; &nbsp; the Stay at Home moms group (meet up) is not only for&nbsp; SAHM.&nbsp; &nbsp; There are WAHM, WOHM, and even *gasp*&nbsp; DADS!<br /><br /><br />ASAHM&nbsp; was just the original name for the group.<br />

				The Stay at Home Moms group seems to have a lot of nice activities, but it doesn&#039;t permit nannies to participate.&nbsp; As I work full-time, I&#039;m trying to find activities for my son during the week.

				it does not allow a nanny to sign on as a member of the group.. however if a parent wishes another adult to bring the child to an event then of course that is fine.<br /><br />

				I would definately be interested in this. I am a single working mom. Working full time by day and running my own business part time. I knwo a lot of groups in the area for stay at home mommies, but I do think there are benefits working moms can get from networking with eachother. Im in.

				i know this was a few posts back.....but the sahm group is accepting new members (it had to shut down briefly).&nbsp; Nannies aren&#039;t allowed to join the sahm - and only moms can sign up to events that are posted on our calendar (though as was said before, you can bring anyone you want with you).&nbsp; But, members talk on the message board about setting up playdates between sitters, or a &quot;meetup&quot; for babysitters to get together, exchange numbers, etc.&nbsp; lots of people in the group work part time- some full time (like me!)<br /><br />also, if you&#039;re looking for stuff for your sitter to do- there&#039;s the lots of tots at the steinway reformed church- tues and thurs mornings (if it&#039;s not full) wed and thursday afternoons 3:30-5 and there are great music classes in astoria, too (music together, music for aarvarks) and i think some other playgroups around town....hopefiully someone else remembers where/when they are<br /><br />that being said- it would be nice to have a working parent group......the astoria sahm group is great (if i do say so, myself- cause i help run it), but it does not do a lot of &quot;working parent&quot; stuff......i have to work on that! (typing w/one hand- nursing.......sorry)<br />----sarah

				As a new mom, I recently joined the Astoria stay at home moms group and love it. Met many friendly and interesting moms to meet up with. I will soon go back to work (hopefully only 4 days a week) and would like to join also a working moms group. Please let me know if anyone is in the process of setting up one. I would be interested in both weekend activities I could attend and weekdays activities my nanny could attend.
