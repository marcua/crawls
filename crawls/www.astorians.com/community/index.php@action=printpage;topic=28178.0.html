				I have posted on this site since 2006 or 2007 but I am no longer an Astorian since I moved to Whitestone two years ago.&nbsp; I still love Astoria as I do Jackson Heights where i spent many many years but when i moved I realized i could still enjoy&nbsp; Astoria from 15 minutes away.&nbsp; It is kind of sad tht this site has slowed down considerably from its heyday but I still read it and post frequently.<br /><br />A few comments I wanted to make about being an ex-Astorian&nbsp; are that it is very easy to enjoy Astoria and not live in an Astoria zip-code.&nbsp; In some respects I enjoy visiting Astoria more&nbsp; whenever I want rather than living there.<br /><br />Any there other ex-Astorians who still read this post on a regular basis?&nbsp; For those who love Astoria and are afraid of moving I will share the positives/negatives about not living in Astoria but being a frequent visitor to the area.<br />

				I&#039;m not an ex-Astorian, I still live here, but you&#039;re right - you don&#039;t have to actually live here to enjoy it.&nbsp; Your remarks are encouraging.&nbsp; Someday I might actually leave!&nbsp; I would love to hear more from you about the outside world :)

				I am an ex-Astorian as well.&nbsp; I was never a frequent poster on these boards, but I was a frequent reader, and still swing by from time to time and this thread jumped out at me.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />I moved to Astoria in November of 2007 and moved out of it in May of 2013.&nbsp; It was a great home for those 5 1/2 years, where I lived in the Ditmars, 30th Avenue, and Broadway sections of town.&nbsp; With time however, my priorities began to change a bit.&nbsp; The roommate situation, which like for many others in their mid-20s was my only means of affording to live in Astoria, was becoming grating and I felt the strong need to get my own place and knew that my budget would price me out of Astoria (although to be fair, I did see a couple places in Astoria within my range, but they didn&#039;t match other criteria).&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t happy to be leaving, as I really did love Astoria, but I was resigned to it.&nbsp; So one year ago, I moved to Woodside, into my own affordable small studio apartment in an elevator building.&nbsp; One of my biggest surprises in moving here, is that I don&#039;t really miss Astoria that much.&nbsp; While I do miss the vibrancy, the dining options, the cafe life on 30th Avenue, the food trucks, the young and creative vibe and such, the truth of the matter is that for me personally, those were mere backdrops to my admittedly simple life.&nbsp; On a day to day basis, the same conveniences I had in Astoria, I have here in Woodside.&nbsp; I live half a block from a laundromat, a block from a huge 24 hour Rite Aid, and a large grocery store, and a gym, all of which are cheaper and in better conditions than the equivalents I lived near in Astoria.&nbsp; I am only a three minute walk from the train which zips me to my job in Midtown in just as much time as my commute from Astoria did, and a 10 minute walk from the LIRR for treks to the beach.&nbsp; As far as daily conveniences, I&#039;m pretty well set.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />It is true, I don&#039;t have as many dining options, but I&#039;ve found my hole in the wall Mexican place, my pizza place, the food truck I like, etc.&nbsp; Places I like are a bit fewer and further in between.&nbsp; Traveling most places requires a train transfer for me, and weeend trackwork is the norm rather than the exception lately.&nbsp; My neighborhood isn&#039;t as attractive as Astoria, both in aesthetics and name recognition, I don&#039;t have a big park right on the water, the community pride is minimal, and the vibe is more understated, familial and residential, but that step back in a sense, has been nice in some ways.&nbsp; I still visit Astoria, although not as often as I would have thought, visiting a few of my old haunts and just walking around soaking up the street life and energy, and I do get nostalgic and miss it in those days.&nbsp; Truth be told, if I could afford it, I would&nbsp; not have left, but I am content with where I am.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />Astoria is but one neighborhood in a sea of hundreds in this city, and while there are those considering moving to Astoria for whom I am usually the biggest cheerleader, I also feel that for those who continue to struggle because of rising costs and whatnot who have this sense of &quot;Astoria or die&quot;, should see that the world doesn&#039;t end when you veer away from the N train.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;

				I have lived in Astoria since 1994 and love it hear.&nbsp; I am originally from Brooklyn.&nbsp; The reason I love living in Astoria the most is because I live right near the park and in the summer there is so much going on there and the best thing is the pool in the summer.&nbsp; The only thing that could beat that is living by the beach which I did when I lived in Brighton Beach in Brooklyn.&nbsp; I also love the variety of restaurants here and the convenience of having such a short train ride to the city.&nbsp; I have no desire to move from Astoria.&nbsp; It is just getting very expensive to live here.

				I&#039;m also an ex-Astorian and thank you for putting up this thread!&nbsp; Astoria was and still is a huge part of my life, even if I don&#039;t live here anymore.&nbsp; I now live in Jackson Heights and while I admit it was a big adjustment, I now enjoy it very much.&nbsp; Why did I move?&nbsp; &nbsp;Expenses and an awful landlord.&nbsp; Astoria has gotten very popular over the years due to Brooklyn getting priced out and my landlord was just one of many I had that took advantage of that.&nbsp; I grew tired of the number of things breaking down in the house I was renting, and his only putting band-aids on them instead of actually fixing the problems in the first place.&nbsp; My previous landlords were the same way.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve just had some really bad luck with them.&nbsp; I now live in a building with an elevator and laundry and a lot of space - and a management company that takes care of the building with a super that gets paid to fix problems.&nbsp; It&#039;s a breath of fresh air and very much welcome.&nbsp; I have a year round green market and 5 train lines to choose from.&nbsp; What do I miss?&nbsp; Gyms, parks, the variety of restaurants, and my friends.&nbsp; But I&#039;m only a 15 minute ride away so why complain.&nbsp; The gym is coming and so is the park.&nbsp; The other things will catch up too.&nbsp; I am happy to enjoy Astoria no matter where I live and I&#039;m glad there are others who feel the same way.&nbsp; There are lots of fun areas in this wonderful city - and I enjoy visiting many of them!

				I was born and raised in Astoria, now living in East Elmhurst&#039;s &quot;Upper Ditmars&quot; area (some say it&#039;s still Astoria so I guess I am &quot;technically&quot; an ex-Astorian).&nbsp; <br /><br />The town has definitely made a mark on me and molded me to the person I am.&nbsp; Growing up I have witnessed the change from a predominantly Greek/Italian middle-class<br />community with pockets of unsafe areas, car thefts and robberies to the first Starbucks opening on Ditmars, following with gentrification of yuppies, midwesterners and some hipsters.<br />half-a-million dollar condos on 30th avenue? $2000 rents in ugly 3-family houses?&nbsp; $12 burgers next to Greek cafes?&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t have imagined it, but it is reality here now.&nbsp; <br /><br />My condo in upper ditmars is a welcome retreat to the noise and overcrowding in some of Astoria&#039;s centers so that, I don&#039;t miss.&nbsp; <br />Many people say they miss the food but IMO it is over-rated and over-priced 90% of the places I go.&nbsp; I don&#039;t care about that so much.&nbsp; <br />One thing that Astoria has that no one else in Queens can even touch is the night life.&nbsp; I don&#039;t go out as much as I used to but when I did the options were many.<br />The park is great it has been greatly improved from when I grew up.&nbsp; The track is a 500% improvement!<br /><br />Steinway is becoming a dump and its been getting worse with more ghetto stores opening which attract a more seedy demographic from Woodside, <br />the nearby projects and South Astoria (beyond Broadway to Northern Blvd.).&nbsp; I think Astoria needs more parking lots, more trash cans/pickups and better quality stores not 99-cent garbage peddlers and boutique junk.<br /><br />Real Estate will definitely get more expensive.&nbsp; Rents will skyrocket as usual thanks to new developments like Astoria Cove and the waterfront.&nbsp;

				Yup u said it , real estate will only go up&nbsp; , yet the congestion and other poor qualities will continue as more people come in . Parking will suck even more , trains will be even more packed .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For all those who said yrs&nbsp; ago , prices will drop on this very board now are eating their words .&nbsp; &nbsp; To the others asking if&nbsp; 2 or 3 family houses can be found in the 600k range ? where the hell are u living &gt;?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Astoria is great to party in&nbsp; and great being close to manhattan ,&nbsp; &nbsp;but terrible to raise kids and lead a good private life with space .

				If had the money to invest there&#039;s no way I would buy high priced property in any neighborhood in the city.&nbsp; I&#039;d buy in a depressed area that&#039;s on the way up. You get it at a cheap price and watch it go up in value and make a killing. Kind of like Harlem was and has become.

				Oggie I think the people who stayed through the 70&#039;s 80&#039;s and 90&#039;s know that the home&nbsp; they bought for 30k is now worth 950k . So those that sold in the early 90&#039;s and I know a ton if them , all wish they could turn back time.

				If u r looking at it from a financl amgel its a totaly diffrent thing.I rember when u could buy a three famiy home for seventeen thousand in the 50 or in the 60 for thirty,An rents&nbsp; were 70 or 80 dollars a mounth an a big two bedroom in an elevatior building was no more then one hundred.

				Yes times were different. You could buy a 10 family building in Manhattan for 100k. Seems cheap but remember people made 20 dollars a week depending. now its gotten out of control but it goes with supply and demand.&nbsp; and comparing Vegas to astoria is way different.&nbsp; who would want to raise a family in vegas? Crime is horrible&nbsp; drugs r horrible and its full of degenrates

				Every place has&nbsp; some crime Astoria today is far from crime free.Las Vegas isnt what it used to be&nbsp; but what is. As far as pricing years ago a workin man with a family could afford to buy a house or pay rent own a car an go on vacation.Today NY pricing is unreal all for the pleasur of cold snowy winters an hot an humid summers. Las Vegas is hot but dry an an awful lot of houses have pools. Not to metoon communite pools. :laugh:

				I watch a lot of HGTV, and there are great places to live all over the map, but there&#039;s no place like Astoria.<br /><br /><br />As for Las Vegas, from what I&#039;ve seen on tv, it&#039;s completely different from what it was the only time I was there, in the 1970&#039;s.&nbsp; There really are nice private houses and public schools.<br /><br /><br />My all-time real estate hero is the guy in Atlanta who wanted to buy a condo on a $40,000 budget.&nbsp; (No, I&#039;m not missing a zero there.)&nbsp; His agent showed him a $44,000 place - over budget.&nbsp; He negotiated it down to $33,000.&nbsp; It was 3 level, two bedroom place, move in ready for most people, though he remodeled to his taste.&nbsp; He did the work himself and furnished it for $5000.&nbsp; And it&#039;s within walking distance of &quot;everything&quot;.
