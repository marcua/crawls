				** One of the least active voting groups is young voters. I dont think this is just due to will. Some of the most inspired activists in recent years have been young voters **<br /><br />fw:<br /><br />Election Day is just one week away. If you haven&#39;t thought about the candidates and the issues in front of us Americans this year, it&#39;s time to start.<br /><br />But first, in order to vote we all have to find our polling places. You should have already received your polling place information from your local board of elections. In case you haven&#39;t, we&#39;ve made getting that info easy to do. Just go to rockthevote.com or call (866) OUR-VOTE. Make sure you also know when your polling place is open on Election Day and what you need to take with you to vote.<br /><br />Find your polling place now:<br />www.rockthevote.com/pollingplace1<br /><br />In most states you have to register in advance, but in Idaho, Maine, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Wisconsin, and Wyoming you can register to vote at the polls on Election Day.<br /><br />Once you know when and where to vote, take some time to learn about the important issues at stake. Get to know the candidates running for office in your area and where they stand on those issues and also read up on the measures and propositions on your ballot. <br /><br />Are you primed for Election Day and know exactly what makes you want to vote? Tell all of us by making a video statement. Speak up and say why your vote matters: <br />http://uncutvideo.aol.com/events/Rock-the-Vote<br /><br />No video camera? No worries. You can use a webcam, digital camera, or cell phone to record a statement or simply sound off in the conversations in our Facebook group. <br /><br />Just seven days before we all Rock the Vote on November 7. Let&#39;s get ready to do thisâ€”together.
