				You need to hit the street man and get to know your neighborhood and the people and shop owners. Ask the local shop owners if they need any help. As you get to know more people you&#039;ll find work, even if it&#039;s a small job at first. You&#039;ll do fine, you just have to start networking with people.

				Honestly, when I was 18 I had a terrible relationship with my parents, too. I wanted to get out of the house and move somewhere (anywhere!) else. But I didn&#039;t have the money, the job or the means to get housing anywhere. It wasn&#039;t fun to stay with my parents until I got the means to go to college and get out of my annoying hometown, but it was the best choice I could make. We&#039;re closer now; I have a place of my own, a job and friends that I like. I also got a pretty okay education.<br /><br />I know it sucks, but you don&#039;t want to move to NYC without a college degree and without savings. Try looking at colleges in NYC and see if you can apply to one or if there are any that look good to you. Or stay where you are and save more money. You&#039;ll need at least first month&#039;s rent and a security deposit for most sublets, which will be the easiest to get if you arrive without already having a job (that&#039;s what I did when I came here).

				Good luck TSRules - Don&#039;t worry - people come here to NYC all the time - even from your country which you hate.<br />University ? Pay to study ? Again no worries - we always have folks like you come over on tourist and student visas and stay all they want. Many I know do so - most of the time they get into CUNY at the lower rates we give our local residents. Just say you live here and no one questions it, even if you barely speak English. There are so many grants and programs, they will practically&nbsp; pay you to go to school.<br /><br />Jobs, there are so many jobs here the streets are paved with gold and there all kinds of jobs here so have no worries. Believe me the economy is such here that no one can afford to be out of work. You can work 2 and even 3 jobs. There are no limits here in America, especially in NYC<br /><br />We cannot refuse you medical treatment either. Many people get sick or even hit by a car say in Jamaica - and fly to JFK and come to our local hospital (coincidentally named Jamaica) and get wonderful treatment.<br />This will last forever or at least until the Hospitals close going bankrupt giving these services.<br /><br />So do not worry my young Greek friend, who cannot stand living in those terrible conditions over there. You will be welcomed here in America and never look back.

				Sometimes you make a change and your old life does not seem as bad as your new one.&nbsp; While I admire your courage in wanting to make a new start, life in New York is not so easy.
