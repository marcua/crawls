				So yesterday I step off the 7 train at QBP to an announcement that all N/W service to Ditmars is suspended because of an investigation at 59th. Okay, fine, it happens. They&#39;re advising people to take the Q101 or 102. Since I live by 20th Ave, the Q102 isn&#39;t an option. <br /><br />So, I make my way down to the bus stop to wait for a Q101. And wait. And wait. And wait. I waited for 45 minutes until a fully packed bus came, stopped, and then drove on without taking on any passengers. I waited so long for that damn bus that the N/W started running again.<br /><br />In this time period, three COMPLETELY EMPTY Q101Rs came and went.<br /><br />Now, wouldn&#39;t common sense dictate that if you have no trains running, then maybe it would be a good idea to turn a limited into a local?

				I like to chant the MTA&#39;s hellish mantra in these trying times:<br /><br /><em>Sometimes you have to go backward to go forward.</em><br /><br />That&#39;s right, it makes very little sense. Maybe its even existential. But that&#39;s exactly what the MTA wants to distract you with.&nbsp;

				Was that around 5:15-ish yesterday?&nbsp; I went to get on the train at 57th/7th and they were making the announcement that trains weren&#39;t running due to an investigation at 59th Street.<br /><br />One N train was stuck in the station and had been for some time - I went ahead and got on anyway and decided to bury my head in a book and not stress too much.<br /><br />Within about ten minutes they started service again (and I even got a seat in the meantime) - the train then went express at Queensboro Plaza and I had to get off and wait for the next train, but I only lost a little bit of my day.<br /><br />It&#39;s impossible to tell with the MTA, but sometimes a little patience gets you somewhere.&nbsp; (And sometimes it doesn&#39;t.)

				The MTA doesn&#39;t seem to put a lot of thought into their Astoria service.&nbsp; It just seems to continue to get worse.&nbsp; Are they adding additional trains with the new cars or just upgrading the cars and keeping the numbers steady?

				Yup, yesterday at Fifth Ave. we got that odd announcement. What &quot;investigation?&quot; Crossed the platform, took the other train, changed at 34th St., turned around and finally got to Queens 40min later than usual. If nothing else it motivates me to take the bike.

				I usually just wait. even when having mta employees laugh for waiting. that happened last month on the R-they said all service was canceled on the N R W and 7 lines because of some signal prob at queensboro plaza. now i ask you, how the hell would that affect the R train? they made us get off the train, so i waited about 15-20 minutes and wouldn&#39;t ya know, the doors to the train i got off of opened right up for passengers.<br />Following their instructions is sometimes couter productive.
