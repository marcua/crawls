				not worth the effort to roll up for us working stiffs, but probably 10 or 20 bucks worth of pennies to a kid looking for a little summer fun money.

				Commerce bank has coin counting machines in their lobby.&nbsp; Doesn&#39;t even take a commission.&nbsp; That said, it is real sweet of you to offer this up to a kid.&nbsp; If there are no bites, bring it to a Commerce branch and go out to a movie!

				my uncle did the same for me when I was visiting him once.&nbsp; it took me all day to roll up a flower pot full of pennies, but at 8 years old 40+ bucks was the most money I ever had all to myself.&nbsp; it was awesome.&nbsp; I wish my current jar of pennies was as cool to my adult mind, but I figured I&#39;d give it a chance for a kid out there.<br /><br />course kids these days probably have all sorts of stuff and don&#39;t want to fiddle with pennies anymore than I do.<br /><br />thanks for the heads up about Commerce, I know where to take my jar of nickels, dimes, and quarters now.

				Absolutely.&nbsp; I save my change at the end of every day and bring it to Commerce once in a while.&nbsp; Last time (I had a really big jar), I made $350!&nbsp; Change is worth a lot more than it looks like...

				Well, ok, it&#39;s worth an explanation.&nbsp; It&#39;s actually my superintendent&#39;s kid.&nbsp; He&#39;s an awesome kid, 10 years old.&nbsp; He&#39;s a really good kid too.&nbsp; And I should mention I have the BEST super in the entire world!&nbsp; Ok, at least in all of NY.&nbsp; He is awesome and always goes out of his way to help me, so I like doing things for him or his kid when I have a chance, you know, just as a way of saying thanks.&nbsp; I figured a jar full of pennies would seem like gold to a 10 year old.

				am I dumb?&nbsp; I don&#39;t understand the negative humor in it.&nbsp; I don&#39;t get it, what&#39;s negative about a landlord&#39;s son?&nbsp; Is it that the landlord would have money so why should his son get more money?

				^^,^<br /><br />yah, i suppose the renter&#39;s life in NYC makes one jaded - it would appear that people that inherit buildings in any of the boroughs and then rent them out for almost-free income each month kinda have it made (hence the Mercades after Mercades we see here in Astoria), but I suppose I&#39;m just being prejudice.&nbsp; If its the super&#39;s son, that&#39;s cool then :)
