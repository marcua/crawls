				Is there anything to be done about this? Some of the worst offenders are on the corners of 30th and the 30s. It&#039;s a direct corridor from the train/Key Food/Other locations from which you might carry packages...and tables extending nearly the entirety of the sidewalk in addition to people congregating on the sidewalk with no concern for residents (i.e. stepping aside for people with bags, leaving a walkway) is aggravating!<br />

				But isn&#039;t that part of the charm of Astoria? Cafes and outdoor restaurant taking up at least half of the sidewalk, and those waiting for a table taking up the rest of the space. The person responsible for seating the customers should be asking those standing to clear the walk for pedestrians, but they don&#039;t want to offend them and lose them as customers. I frequently walk into the street and around cars in order to get by. It&#039;s been this way for years, and it will never change.

				It&#039;s not fun when you&#039;re coming from the laundry or the supermarket carrying heavy bags and you can&#039;t even walk on your own sidewalk because a sidewalk cafe is taking up more than half of a narrow sidewalk and people are sitting with their chairs way out or hold their cigarettes out to the side so they don&#039;t annoy their companions (but it&#039;s fine if they burn you or your clothes or your bag.<br /><br /><br />Where are pedestrians supposed to walk - in the gutter? No, don&#039;t think so. <br /><br /><br />I walk where I like/need to and the sidewalk cafe that I have to pass every day on my way home just has to deal with it. If they don&#039;t want their patrons to be bumped by a shopping bag or whatever, then move your tables further in, not further out. The sidewalk I&#039;m talking about is a side street, not the avenue, and it&#039;s too small to have 2 rows of tables. <br /><br /><br />Sorry to rant, but I&#039;ve been reading this thread for a few days and that &#039;lighten up&#039; comment was the last straw. <br /><br /><br />Between the drivers who act like they&#039;re doing us a favor by slowing down, not even stopping at a stop sign, so we can cross to these cafes who are infringing on our walking space, it seems like pedestrians are portrayed as the ones who are wrong. <br /><br /><br />Probably because I don&#039;t drive and walk everywhere I&#039;m more sensitive to this, but these cafe owners need to consider everyone&#039;s needs, not just their own.

				sorry, I didn&#039;t mean to offend by saying &quot;lighten up.&quot; I wonder if you are talking about the Avenue cafe on 36th and 30th avenue. That place does take up a lot of sidewalk space.<br /><br />However, the problem is that a few of the restaurants are not doing anything to keep their waitstaff and patrons out of the way on the sidewalks. I don&#039;t think the answer is more sidewalk legislation, the answer is to find the restaurant if they are causing a blockage. If they put signs out that say &quot;Be respectful to our neighbors and don&#039;t block the sidewalk&quot; that would help. They should also have a no-smoking policy on the side streets, in my opinion.<br /><br />I really think that the majority of sidewalk cafes are not in anybody&#039;s way - even the ones on side streets. The entire community should not suffer because of a few careless restaurant owners. They should face a fine if they block the streets. That will take care of the problem right away.<br />

				So, if they have licenses, etc. Is there a fine for blocking so much sidewalk? How much sidewalk are they allowed to occupy? I like the sidewalk cafes of Astoria. And certainly, there are some cafes that are less intrusive to pedestrians because of location. I agree that it seems like the problem could be easily solved by moving their tables in about 1 ft and telling their waitstaff to stay inside the restaurant. Maybe I will just try to tell them? Call 311?<br /><br />Also...I&#039;m very confused by the allowance of smoking sections in the patio portions of restaurants. I thought this was illegal in NYC. And being burned by cigarettes as you walk by is probably the most unpleasant of offenses these sidewalk cafes commit. Unless you count patrons commenting about women walking by, but male chauvinists cannot be controlled as easily.<br />

				I take a larger issue with the people standing around than those that are in the seats. Two big offenders of this are Grand and Avenue, but the BIGGEST to me by far is Queens Comfort. Often, you simply cannot get through, and must either stop, say excuse me, and wait for them to move, or go into the street.

				They are required to allow pedestrians to easily pass through. If their patrons are hanging around blocking foot traffic, you have a right to file a complaint. I think the smoking is illegal unless they have a special permit.<br /><br />Most of those places have a European mentality about smoking so it&#039;s part of their culture to hang out, smoke, and watch ladies walk by (which I agree is annoying). <br /><br />I walk down 30th avenue every day with my dog and I&#039;ve never had a problem getting past anyone. I like the activity and I find that most people move out of the way for me.

				Queens Comfort&#039;s crowd always seems the least aware that they are all blocking the sidewalk, and the slowest to move out of the way. It&#039;s almost ironic because they don&#039;t even have sidewalk seating...it&#039;s just a place that doesn&#039;t control their waiting patrons.

				I understand about the European mentality - I&#039;ve travelled all over Europe and have enjoyed sidewalk cafes there myself.<br /><br /><br />But Kelly - try walking your dog on 29th Street, right off 30th Avenue on the side where the cafe is. If it&#039;s busy, it won&#039;t be easy. <br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve also seen the crowd in front of Queens Comfort - very inconsiderate of the owners not to organize the waiting patrons. But then again, it shows a lack of manners and common sense that I&#039;ve noticed a lot lately.

				I know the spot you mean and I&#039;ve walked my dog there too. Maybe my idea of space is just different because I always feel like I can walk through there fine. But I can see how it could get crowded if people are loitering on the corner.<br /><br />The Queens Comfort crowd are mostly young white hipster types (generally speaking). They also loiter outside of Dominie&#039;s pub at night. The owners simply need to be better at crowd control or put a sign up there, or some benches for them to sit on.<br />

				I&#039;m somewhat of a regular at Dominies, and I think the crowd there usually sticks to the curb or the door, and I&#039;ve seen the bouncer (on the nights that they do have one) clear people from the walkway. I think if they made the back outside area patron-friendly, more people would have their smokes out there. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				Last night I walked home from the subway at 5:20 and two people had their chairs turned out to 29th Street while someone else was holding their cigarette way out as well. I&#039;m trying to walk by carrying two shopping bags from Trader Joe&#039;s and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and there really isn&#039;t room. <br /><br /><br />So now I just don&#039;t care if my bag or whatever hits the tables, the chairs or the people. Some of you will say that&#039;s the wrong attitude, very combative, etc. <br /><br /><br />But the sidewalks are for walking. And that stretch is narrower than the avenue is. And to me it&#039;s more important for people to be able to walk safely and comfortably than for someone to sit and have coffee and a cigarette on the street. I kind of think that&#039;s what I pay taxes for…….

				To me Taverna Kyclades on Ditmars is the worst.&nbsp; They have a lot of outdoor seating and then they have so many people waiting to be seated taking up the whole sidewalk.&nbsp; It&#039;s like this every night.&nbsp; You practically have to push people out of the way to walk past there.&nbsp; They don&#039;t move sometimes even if they see you walking.

				The newest, and to me the worst, offender of this is Tu Casa. They have their seats that take up more than half the width of the sidewalk, and on garbage night, there is about 3ft of walking space, not kidding. <br /><br /><br />I have a pic that I need to do the hosts on the intarwebz for make benefit of showing you.

				every time i walk by Thirsty Koala I think &quot;their permit can&#039;t possibly allow them to have this many tables and/or to extend this far from their restaurant. &quot;&nbsp; I care in a general way, but not enough to complain.&nbsp; They may have a permit, but the permits are very specific about what is and isn&#039;t allowed.&nbsp; The Community Board has to authorize the permits.&nbsp; If you are unhappy with how a facility is using its permit, call/email and complain. Community Board 1 is meeting on 9/16&nbsp; show up and voice your concerns.
