				Hey,<br />I have to write an article for my school newspaper (I go to Queens College). I am supposed to choose a neighborhood controversy (I chose Astoria) and research, investigate and interview people about it. I read about the new &quot;Pedestrian Plaza Proposal&quot; for Astoria. This will attract more people, including more tourists to Astoria and it will also affect parking. What do you guys think about this? Are there are community meetings I can attend to further investigate this?<br />Thank You!!!&nbsp; :-)

				It seems that it would just be that section between Athens Cafe and Keyfood. One block long. It&#039;s not a heavily travelled road. I can see that area being a great candidate for a plaza.

				And what happens to the Q18 bus - it&#039;ll have to be re-routed. I don&#039;t drive, but when I&#039;m on the bus<br />or am a passenger in a car, just trying to get up and down 30th Avenue is a hassle. Now it&#039;ll be worse <br />if you have to detour over to 31st Ave.<br /><br />And I agree w/a previous poster - what is the excitement about with walking in the middle of the street? <br />The sidewalk cafes, including Athens and one by me at 29th St. &amp;&nbsp; 30th Ave., take up so much sidewalk space<br />that it&#039;s difficult to just get by and go about your business. If the one by me had their way, we&#039;d be walking out<br />in the traffic. <br /><br />I work in the Flatiron district where they&#039;ve done this and it&#039;s ridiculous. All the buses that used to run down Broadway <br />don&#039;t anymore and you have people sitting on boulders and metal chairs right next to the traffic on Fifth Avenue - this is<br />at 25th Street across from Madison Square Park. I don&#039;t see the attraction of breathing in car fumes and wondering when<br />an accident will happen with someone losing control of their car. <br /><br />Why doesn&#039;t the city spend more money improving the state of our parks? Astoria Park is wonderful, but there&#039;s always<br />room for improvement.

				What can I say?&nbsp; I happen to like the pedestrian plazas.&nbsp; Especially the one in Madison.&nbsp; I also like all the green spaces the city is building throughout the city.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; I don&#039;t know.&nbsp; Maybe because they are nicer looking than the traffic clogging our streets every day.&nbsp; Maybe because it&#039;s nice being able to walk around Times Square without stopping all the time to wait at the lights with 50 million other people on the sidewalk.&nbsp; It&#039;s really opened up some really pedestrian congested areas.&nbsp; I know when I worked in Times Square it was a huge pain in the ass having to get anywhere due to the masses of people.&nbsp; Opening the streets seems so much better to me.&nbsp; I like being outside.&nbsp; &nbsp;I love outdoor cafes.&nbsp; I like people watching.&nbsp; As far as accidents go, I can&#039;t go around being worried about that all the time.&nbsp; That can happen on any pedestrian crowded sidewalk as well.&nbsp; As far as the tables taking up so much space on the sidewalk, there are regulations on how much space they can take, and if they are violating that, you can always report them.&nbsp; &nbsp;But if we have an open space in the street to walk in instead, that negates the problem right there.<br /><br />Traffic&#039;s always going to be a problem in this city.&nbsp; There are no easy answers to the rerouting that will occur.&nbsp; It&#039;s always the cars vs the pedestrians in major cities.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have the answers but that&#039;s why I&#039;m not on the committees that make these decisions.<br /><br /><br />

				I too, also like the pedestrian plazas. I had family from Philly in town, and we walked down Broadway in Midtown in the &quot;street&quot; and it was so much nicer of an experience than everyone cramming on the sidewalks with the vendors. In high foot traffic areas, the pedestrian plazas are worth the loss of street.<br /><br />In Astoria, southern more so, I think it would work great. And store owners who lament the loss of car traffic affecting their business, well I think the increase in foot traffic is more beneficial. Up north it&#039;s not nearly as dense, and I don&#039;t sense the need to shut roads to make room for people. As a driver, I do sometimes take my car from Ditmars to more southern avenues because it&#039;s convenient. But I do not freak out if I can&#039;t get parking directly in front of my destination. I go for the nearest available spot. If that&#039;s 5 blocks away, so be it. <br /><br />And speaking about cafe/restaurant tables outside and lack of sidewalk space, has anyone been on 2nd Ave on the UES lately? Where the 2nd Ave Subway construction takes up one 1/2 of the sidewalk, and then tables and chairs take up another 1/2, so you must walk single file past each other... and this lady isn&#039;t grasping the concept and refuses to stand behind her husband for a second so I can pass... sigh. I feel like in that scenario they really shouldn&#039;t have tables outside. Besides, who wants to eat next to a bunch of nasty construction?

				A couple points. <br /><br />The Q18 shouldn&#039;t be effected. The NY1 video piece is talking about Newtown between 32nd and 33rd st. At least that&#039;s what Vallone is pushing for. <br /><br />Regarding Madison Park, You can now get some cool pics of the Flatiron Building from vantage points not available before.

				The sidewalk cafés create pedestrian congestion (many violate the Department of Consumer Affairs permit by installing more tables and chairs than they are allowed to).&nbsp; The owner of the Athens Cafe is a past financial supporter of Peter F. Vallone, Jr., so it does not surprise me he has been trying to get a &quot;pedestrian plaza&quot; for them.&nbsp; In fact, I would not even call this a pedestrian plaza as much as it is a free land grab.

				Thanks for all of your feedback fellow Astorians! I unfortunately can&#039;t switch the subject now (although I wish I could, since it isn&#039;t too much of a controversy). But I will definitely look further into how this might affect public transportation. Also, I will look into if property values will rise and if it does that will make it difficult for lower middle class and even middle class people to live there and especially if they want to move there. Parking is definitely a hassle already and even the idea that parking might be even slightly affected already bothers me. I will interview people throughout 30th avenue on Saturday, so hopefully some of you will be there!

				I have crossed that street many dozens of times, and I can&#039;t remember seeing more than a handful of cars on it. The street is a public space, the cafe cannot expand into it. It can only go up to it&#039;s property line.

				A Pedestrian Plaza in 30th Avenue is not a good idea. There are already way too many coffee houses and restaurants on 30th Avenue taking up so much space people often have to walk past by in single file.

				A land grab for Athens Cafe is exactly what it would be and would majorly increase their business -- people aren&#039;t just going to sit there and people watch like so many do in Manhattan, they&#039;re going to buy food/beverages at Athens Cafe and then sit in the plaza area without going through table service. The reason why the plazas are successful in Manhattan is the combination of business people who use the plazas to relax at lunch, combined with tourists who are enjoying the sights of the city. That&#039;s not exactly the situation in the middle of Astoria. I&#039;m sure the homeless dude who sits in the bus shelter and the various old retired guys who wander the neighborhood and sit in the Dunkin Donuts all day might appreciate it, but other than Athens Cafe business, I don&#039;t see it being used by people who are expressly heading over there to sit in the pedestrian plaza.<br /><br />In all honesty, how many people have actually headed into Manhattan with the sole purpose of sitting in a pedestrian plaza without any other reason to be there? If you want to sit around and enjoy the outdoors, you head to Central Park, not the pedestrian plaza in Times Square. <br /><br />Plus, it <em>will </em> have a negative affect on traffic in the area -- traffic at that intersection is already terrible. Key Food often uses that space in front for their home delivery service and for vendors making deliveries to Key Food. Displace those vehicles and they end up double parking on 33rd Street or taking up parking spaces for other shoppers. Parking is already difficult around there, by taking away even more parking -- between the spots removed from the plaza and the vehicles displaced by the closing of the street -- it would just make an already difficult situation worse. So while Athens Cafe may benefit from the placement of a pedestrian plaza there, many other local business will likely be harmed.<br /><br />Finally, while the plazas in Manhattan tend to be well maintained, do we really think the Astoria plaza will be as well? I highly doubt it. We have a major graffiti problem in our neighborhood -- there&#039;s something new on the gate at Bargain Stop everytime I pass by there. I can totally see kids using whatever seating is available as a canvass for their &quot;art.&quot; I can totally see stuff getting destroyed and misused. We don&#039;t have santitation workers and folks from the Ready, Able &amp; Willing program walking around cleaning up constantly like they do in Manhattan. Without constant vigilance and maintainance, the plaza will just sit there and be a blight on the neighborhood. Maybe I&#039;m overly pessimistic, but this isn&#039;t Manhattan -- there&#039;s not exactly the same attention to aesthetics as one would see in midtown.

				I agree about how the &#039;plaza&#039; would be maintained. Look at &quot;Athens Square Park&quot;. What a joke. <br /><br />I walk past it every morning and it&#039;s filled with trash and assorted crap from all the neighborhood residents<br />who are too lazy to walk over to any of the numerous trash cans that are everywhere you turn. The idiots who <br />skateboard there actually leave wood boards for their &#039;pursuit&#039; that the parks department people don&#039;t even <br />bother to get rid of anymore when they&#039;re there for maintenance. <br /><br />I love Astoria and have lived here all my life. But really, a &#039;plaza&#039; here is not the same as sitting on beautiful,<br />well maintained avenue or piazza in Europe, where there&#039;s more respect for these areas and the locals don&#039;t <br />trash them. <br />
