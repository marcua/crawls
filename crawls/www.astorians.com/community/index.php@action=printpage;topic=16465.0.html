For what I&#039;ve read, the changes would limit construction of larger apartment buildings on streets that are primarily low-rise, which seems like a good idea to me. <br /><br />Does anyone understand the details of the rezoning plan and could please give an explanation of them in plain English? Good points? Bad points? Things Astorians should be concerned about? Any thoughts would be much appreciated.<br /><br />edit: any comments are welcome actually.

				Here are some links off of the nyc.gov site:<br />http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/pdf/zone/map9a.pdf - the current zoning and layering of Astoria<br />http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/zone/zh_r5.shtml - R5 above GCP<br />http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/zone/zh_r6.shtml - R6 below GCP<br /><br />Until they post the proposal it is hard to tell what they are rezoning specifically.&nbsp; But walking around 37th and 38th between 34th Ave and 28th Ave you can see many new buildings that are in the process of going up that may have inspired this rezoning.&nbsp; They are 4 story buildings with balconies in front and mostly unfinished (bad timing).&nbsp; They seem to have replaced many attached or semi-attached homes.<br /><br />It will be interesting to see where this goes though.<br />

				<br />To say that the rezoning plan is &#039;finalized&#039; may be a bit premature.&nbsp; Rezoning an entire Community Board (CB)or even a part thereof must go through a review process called ULURP (Uniform Land Use Review Procedure).&nbsp; All currently open ULURP applications for Queens CB1 are listed here:<br /><br />http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/pdf/lu_apps/ulurp_q01.pdf<br /><br />Other than the proposed Hallet&#039;s Cove development, I don&#039;t see anything that covers more than a couple of tax lots.&nbsp; So this rezoning hasn&#039;t entered the formal review process yet.&nbsp; Probably what&#039;s happening is that the Dept of City Planning (DCP) has completed their studies and presented their findings and recommendations to the CB for input prior to starting ULURP.

				I don&#039;t know enough about the rezoning either.&nbsp; It was mentioned over on the Queens Crap blog - http://queenscrap.blogspot.com/2009/10/vallone-eyes-astoria-rezone.html.&nbsp; There&#039;s some helpful information in the comments section of the blog post.&nbsp;
