				I&#039;ve never used wireless internet (except on my cell phone).&nbsp; Last week I took my laptop for repairs and borrowed another laptop from where I work to use at home.&nbsp; My laptop has an imbedded wireless antenna, and I think the borrowed one has one too, but at home any time I&#039;ve tried to connect to the net wirelessly I&#039;ve gotten a message saying no networks have been detected.&nbsp; This was just experimenting to see what would happen - I pay for internet at home and just plug into it.<br /><br />Today I got my laptop back.&nbsp; At home I still had the borrowed laptop on my desk, and plugged into the phone jack, though not actually connected (the computer on, but not connected to the internet).&nbsp; I set up my own laptop in a spot I wouldn&#039;t usually have it.&nbsp; I was surprised when on my laptop I suddenly got a message saying that wireless networks had been detected.&nbsp; At least 10 listings were displayed.&nbsp; They all say the are security enabled.&nbsp; I clicked on one to see what would happen.&nbsp; I was asked to type in a key, the message said a key was necessary to keep the security of the network.<br /><br />Since I&#039;ve never connected wirelessly to the net, I don&#039;t know - is this what you&#039;re supposed to see?&nbsp; I only clicked one network, as an experiment.&nbsp; Do they all ask for a key?&nbsp; Where do you get the key?&nbsp; Is there any network I should avoid?&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t pay a bill or make a purchase wirelessly, but is there anything else about wireless networks I should be warned about?

				If they all are &quot;secure&quot; you&#039;ll need a password to access them. You can put in a wireless router very inexpensively yourself though. My favorite router is the WRT54GL (http://www.amazon.com/Linksys-Cisco-WRT54GL-Wireless-G-Broadband-Compatible/dp/B000BTL0OA) - this is the best router I&#039;ve ever had. It&#039;s extremely stable.<br /><br />But it&#039;s normal to see all the networks if you enable the wireless card. Evidently on your second laptop the wireless is turned on.

				The passwords are set by the owners of the wireless networks that you see - your neighbors - to prevent strangers from joining them.<br /><br />Someone who wants to offer wireless service to the hoi polloi (or someone ignorant) would configure their access point without a password.

				Each of the &quot;networks&quot; you see is a wireless router that belongs to someone nearby.&nbsp; The owner of the router set it&#039;s password, and could tell it to you.<br /><br />Your question is similar to asking &quot;where do I find the keys that fit the nice BMW parked in front of my house?&quot;

				You can&#039;t get a password unless you know one of the owners and they give it to you. &nbsp;If it were an unsecured network, anyone could tap into it without a password. &nbsp;If you were to get a wireless router for your computer, when your neighbors sign on they would be able to see your wireless network listed just as you see theirs. &nbsp;

				Those are other people&#039;s wireless routers, if you use their internet you are &quot;stealing&quot; their broadband (at least that is what some would say.)<br /><br />By the way, there is absolutely nothing less secure about surfing over a wireless connection than a wired connection. Both are equally encrypted (since encryption happens in the browser BEFORE it&#039;s transmitted through a wire or antenna), and second because if someone is going to snoop there are about a million times more people that could snoop the connection through the &quot;wire&quot; than through your small wireless connection.<br /><br />Also, I&#039;m not sure what you mean by &quot;phone jacks&quot;, are you using dialup internet? If you have broadband, you don&#039;t connect to any phone jacks, and there wouldn&#039;t be multiple ones in your house. You would connect your computer to an external DSL or cable modem - your computer wouldn&#039;t be connected directly to the wall, but to one of those devices, and that device to the wall.
