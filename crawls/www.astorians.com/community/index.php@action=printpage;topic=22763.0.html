				I was listening to 1010 WINS this morning and they mentioned that a new Brewery is going to be built in Astoria.&nbsp; They had a soundbite of the owner who said that the place will be on 20th ave and 37st and he wanted to focus on lagers in addition to other beers. <br />&nbsp;<br />http://www.brewstoria.com/?p=416 (http://www.brewstoria.com/?p=416)<br />&nbsp;<br />Very excited to hear this news.&nbsp; Anyone have any additional information?&nbsp; they said it would be the first brewery in Queens since the 50s.&nbsp;

				I&#039;m super excited for this as well! I can&#039;t wait to go often and try their seasonal beers.&nbsp; The only other news I&#039;ve read about it, came from a thread here (title is something like &#039;What&#039;s Better than a Beer Garden&#039;).&nbsp; The OP linked to this article: <br />http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20120522/astoria/queens-get-its-first-brewery-decades<br /><br />I wonder if I can entice them into brewing a batch of maple sap beer.&nbsp; Apparently, maple sap beer is making a resurgence with some New England microbreweries.&nbsp; And I very much want to try some.&nbsp; I may even make the trek to Vermont to get some, but it&#039;d be awesome if I could get it locally. <br />

				there is a place on their website that asks for suggestions on what to brew...sounds like you might be in business.&nbsp; I will also request a maple beer to get the interest going.&nbsp; I have never heard of that and it sounds great!<br />&nbsp;<br />singlecutbeer.com

				He&#039;s going to focus on lagers? Hopefully IPA&#039;s will be on the agenda! I was at Googa Mooga on Sunday and noticed that one of the beer selections was a maple porter by Brooklyn Brewery. I believe it was a cask ale, but I&#039;m not sure. I should&#039;ve tried it, but opted for the Anchor porter instead-which was ice cold, full bodied and very tasty!

				I was envisioning like a winery where you can taste &amp; buy, but there&#039;s a nice tasting room.&nbsp; My guess is if they&#039;re successful, then we&#039;ll see a phase II happen with a larger tasting room/pubbery of sorts

				From their website:&nbsp; www.singlecutbeer.com (http://www.singlecutbeer.com)<br />&nbsp;<br />Today, Rich and I have reviewed the floor plan for the brewery, which will include a “Tap Room” for beer sampling, growler sales and will also offer beer for on-premise consumption during events. What’s more, there will be a stage for live music. Given that all the Beersmiths themselves are musically inclined, I suspect this stage will be used for off-hours jams too. I happen to blow a pretty mean jazz flute so I’m stoked! – Rulpsen

				Wonderful! I can&#039;t wait to try his creations!<br />I would like to request something similar to Sierra Nevada Torpedo, their Celebration Ale (fresh hop ale), and Six Point&#039;s Bengali Tiger. I haven&#039;t tried Six Point Resin yet- an imperial IPA at 9% ABV?! Oh- and can he please brew up something similar to DogFish Head&#039;s Indian Brown Ale? Malty Hoppy Goodness.<br />I&#039;m sure Rich won&#039;t let me down.&nbsp; :grin:

				The Six Point Resin is phenomenal (picked up a sixer at Bravo a few weeks back), but really pack a punch. Another good one to try is Dubhe Black Imperial Ale (brewed from hemp seed, I believe). Fantastic.<br /><br /><br />Psyched for this place!
