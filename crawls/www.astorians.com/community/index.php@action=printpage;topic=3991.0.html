				those were just the places i could think of! other suggestions are welcome too.<br />however, if the consensus says Mundo, then Miri is right, we should shoot for a weeknight so that we have better odds of having the place to ourselves. like a Wednesday or a Thursday.<br />i&#39;d be happy to pop in and see what they do for large groups-like do we have a special prefixe type menu, can we order a la cart for a little less since there will (hopefully) be many of us.<br />although those who replied like the idea of mundo, not a whole lot of people have replied.<br />how about, since it is only november 1st, i&#39;ll pop in or call sometime this week, see what the deal is for a large crowd...i&#39;ll say between 10 and 20 people...and report back to see what everyone thinks. <br />BUT suggest away at other places if you so choose.<br /><br />er...i guess i&#39;m taking on being the november coordinator.<br />look at me, i go to one EATS event and i take over....so like me.

				I heart potlucks!<br />It neatly resolves the perennial issue of effective social &quot;mixing&quot;-- with a buffet-style table of everyone&#39;s homemade goodies, people will mingle more and circulate well. As opposed to seating (sometimes inaccessible if you&#39;re sitting in the middle of a banquette and want to go talk to people at the end of the table).<br />Did I mention I heart potlucks?<br />I also heart Festivus.<br />It would be a nice break from the growing madness of family-event-season.<br />

				Uncle Telly&#39;s grabbin&#39; the bull by the horns. The officially sanctioned flooz Astoria EATS event will be on Tuesday 28 November @ 7PM at Wave Thai. Pre-dinner drinks to be had at Stini Yiamas.<br /><br />Wave Thai is located on 31st street north of Ditmars Blvd and south of 21st Ave. It is on the east side of the street in the middle of the block about a one or two minute walk from the Ditmars train station.<br /><br />Stini Yiamas is at 35-05 Ditmars Blvd at 35th Street right next to 718 (a restaurant for those not in the know).<br /><br />Sound off if you are attending so I can give the man a headcount in advance.

				Sorry folks, this is the first time i&#39;ve been on this site in like 2 weeks. Verizon at home sucks major balls and i&#39;ve effectively replaced the last 2 people in my office who quit. It&#39;s a sucky time for me to plan things. Go figure i go ahead and try to be a more active and contributing member of our little corner of the hood and i go and screw it up. i&#39;m sorry. i was going to suggest later this month but you seem to have that taken care of. oh well, i&#39;ll be missing it as i hate thai food. the horror! <br />perhaps we can do mundo in january. i&#39;ll have enough time to plan that one.<br />now to pop into potluck threads...

				I am easily impressed by wheat gluten, I imagine.&nbsp; It&#39;s so cool that there&#39;s this protein that comes from wheat!&nbsp; I just think it&#39;s neat.&nbsp; I&#39;ve also made gluten chunks and enjoyed the process of making it; I&#39;d like to do it again, actually. &nbsp;I enjoy the texture of the veggie duck very much, and am also amused by the &quot;dimpling&quot; texture they use on the outer side of the &quot;duck&quot;.&nbsp; I find the gluten to have a wonderful savory flavor spiked with a bit of sweetness.&nbsp; I enjoy its color.&nbsp; I like the fact that it&#39;s another protein out there, an option to tofu or animal protein.&nbsp; It&#39;s kind of exotic to me.&nbsp; But yes, overall I&#39;m charmed by the veggie duck!

				Ok, after all the odes to vegetarian duck, I have to come out on this one.&nbsp; I do not like the vegetarian duck.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=3991.msg42257.html#msg42257">Quote from: Harlan on November 28, 2006, 02:05:27 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I&#39;m decidedly not a vegetarian, but I honestly think that the vegetarian duck is the tastiest protein source on Wave&#39;s menu! </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I think the real duck is much tastier.&nbsp; The vegetarian duck tastes to me like a weird, dense, rubbery soggy raw piece of bread - which makes some sense considering it is made from wheat gluten.&nbsp; It&#39;s not the fact that it is a vegetarian substitute (although I&#39;m not really into vegetarian substitutes for meat - i.e. fake meat - I do eat them occasionally and have no objection to them, even though I am also decidedly a meat eater), it&#39;s just not appealing to me.&nbsp; In a way, it&#39;s intriguing to me -- I&#39;ll have a piece now and then from someone else&#39;s plate, to see if I suddenly like it, but I haven&#39;t changed my mind yet.<br /><br />I see that most of the descriptives I have used to describe the vegetarian duck relate to texture as opposed to taste.&nbsp; I see that megc has referred to its &quot;bit of sweetness&quot; (I agree), and I think that is another issue I have with it.&nbsp; However, I do not have a sweet tooth at all, so for a protein source to have some sweetness is very disconcerting to me.&nbsp; The other night, I had Wave&#39;s real duck in spicy brown sauce, and it was delicious.
