				My friend informed me that she saw a man walking up and down Ditmars and 37th Street (by McCann&#039;s) last night all bloodied... screaming someone with a bat beat him and his mother... A few minutes later a man was seen with a bat and the bloodied man was yelling &quot;that&#039;s him&quot;.. my friend was freaked out and went home, but said she heard police cars coming...<br /><br />Did anyone hear about this incident?

				I didn&#039;t hear about this, but last night when I got off the train I saw my FORTH fight in 2 months under the sunway tracks by Frankie&#039;s Pizza.&nbsp; A group of kids were beating and kicking this one guy... and then they all scattered.&nbsp; It made me really nervous to walk home because they were all running down 31st St and 23rd Ave.&nbsp; <br /><br />A few weeks ago on a Friday night as I was exitting Key Food a kid came running in with a bloody face followed by 2 women and cops screaming &quot;That&#039;s him! He beat us!&quot;.&nbsp; Plus I&#039;ve seen two other fights under the subway tracks by Frankie&#039;s, all big groups of kids.&nbsp; This is getting ridiculous with the fights, there needs to be more of a cop presence until they get this handled!&nbsp; I&#039;m moving soon and really wanted to stay off of Ditmars but this is making me think twice.... is this something 311 would handle?

I can&#039;t imagine it gets much safer than ditmars in NYC, unfortunately what you are witnessing is just a reflection of our society and poor parenting. You have that everywhere

				Oh my gosh, that&#039;s terrifying! I live right there and must&#039;ve missed this. About a year ago, when I was living in the Broadway area, I witnessed a group of middle school aged kids chasing some other kids down 34th street, and they were all holding these massive bricks and yelling really aggressively. I didn&#039;t know if this warranted me calling the cops, so I didn&#039;t. But now I&#039;m ashamed that I made that choice because who knows what could&#039;ve happened. In any event, I am literally appalled by these kids today. <br /><br />On another note, should I be embarrased that when I first read the subject line, my first thought was of literal bats swooping down on folks?&nbsp; &nbsp;:oops:

				Ditmars Blvd. is and always has been an attraction for troublemakers.&nbsp; <br />Any large avenue with stores, restaurants, schools, bus and train stops, etc. will attract undesirable types. <br /><br />If you see something call 911 a.s.a.p.!&nbsp; Get the police off their lazy rear ends and involved in the community.

				I was hoping it was animal bats.&nbsp; We need more of those kinds of bats in the whole area because they eat mosquitoes.<br /><br />
