				So I wanted to get this out there, in case anyone has some names / references that we can start pestering, but since we have some big things happening in the next year (a wedding being the biggest) I figured it wouldn&#039;t hurt to try and get a list of realtor / landlord / whatever names together as we&#039;re looking to move by March of 2013. <br /><br />Some history. I&#039;ve been in this apartment since 2003, and it&#039;s been great, but we just want something a little bit bigger, with a little bit more storage space and most importantly, we want something with outdoor space. <br /><br />So basically what we&#039;re looking for is a 1/2 bedroom, with outdoor space, building or private home are both options. A reliable landlord is A MUST. Moving blows, and our 10 year stay in the current space should be a testament to our desire to find a place and stay there. Our monthly budget is $1550 (based on income, this would be well within our 1/40 of salary range - with financials to back that up). We&#039;re currently near 30th ave in the 40s, and would love to stay on this side of the neighborhood, but are certainly not opposed to the Ditmars area (because I can still ride my bike to Sorriso&#039;s). <br />No kids, no pets, and non-smokers, so that&#039;s not an issue. Laundry on site would be stellar, but not a breaking point.<br /><br />So yeah, fully realize that it&#039;s way early, but we&#039;re probably going to start looking in November in hopes of signing for Feb 1, 2013 to give us a month overlap to make the first move in a decade slightly less sucky.

				So, now we&#039;re getting serious about looking. Wondering if anyone out there has any recommendations for brokers (or even better owners) who tend to have places in 1 family houses with backyard space, it would be greatly appareciated. We&#039;re making some calls this week, but I&#039;d love more recommendations. <br />I&#039;ve been through the realtor thread, and it&#039;s like 72% astroturf, so finding the remaining 28% worthwhile information is difficult to say the least.<br />That said, our budget has been upped a bit to $1700 max (again, still well within the 1/40 rule - with documentation to verify) both of our credit scores are over 700. I&#039;ve been in my current space for 10 years, and would like to find a place I could live in for another 10. I would absolutely love to avoid brokers, so any owners out there who might have something that fit our criteria, please contact us.
