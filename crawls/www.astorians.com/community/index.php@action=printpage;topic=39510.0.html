				<br />Hi All.&nbsp; Does anyone know of any places in Astoria that do official Passport photos?&nbsp; I work in Midtown and found a few places but they want like $25 or something, for two little passport pix to be spit out of a machine.&nbsp; I refuse to pay that.&nbsp; ;-)<br /><br />Thanks!

				I had a really hard time finding a passport photo place in the neighborhood recently.&nbsp; I used to go to the photo place on 31st Street near Ditmars but that doesn&#039;t exist anymore.&nbsp; CVS on the corner of 31st and Ditmars has a passport photo option, but they did such a poor job (using a point &amp; shoot camera and crappy printing) that I refused purchasing it.&nbsp; The closest place I found was a photo place in Greenpoint.&nbsp; They did a really good job with a professional SLR camera and two photos were, I think around $10 and instantaneous.&nbsp; The place is:<br /><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: arial;" class="bbc_font">Kubus Photo</span></span></strong> <strong>&nbsp; </strong><br />102A Nassau Ave<br />Brooklyn, NY 11222b/t Eckford St &amp; Leonard St&nbsp; <br />Greenpoint<br />(718) 389-1339<br />kubusphoto.com (https://www.yelp.com/biz_redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kubusphoto.com&amp;src_bizid=lIzE90iW06XNcsETtj8qEA&amp;cachebuster=1473274055&amp;s=8855b021d487715d4e42c76272bee34c1d309cecd7bf535a58f12c65b2e314f1)<br /><br /><br />Hope this helps!&nbsp; :smiley:&nbsp;

				The last time I needed photos for a passport renewal, I did it at a FedEx office. You could check the Fedex website to see which offices offer <br />that option. The one I used was on East 23rd Street, right off Broadway, just steps away from the N/R 23rd Street station. But I&#039;m sure there<br />are closer ones.

				There&#039;s a photo place right off of the Broadway stop on Broadway between 31st and 30th street. I went there in March and I think it was only $7-$8 for 2 photos. All of the CVS locations are ridiculously overpriced, they want over $20 for 2 photos.<br /><br /><br />BTW, I just renewed my passport by mail and you are no longer required to submit 2 photos, I only had to send one.

				<br />Thanks Funambules.&nbsp; Yes, it so happens I just found the place you mentioned on Yelp, and was planning to go check that place out.&nbsp; ;-)
