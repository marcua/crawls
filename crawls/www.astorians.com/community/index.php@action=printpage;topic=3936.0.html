				I am currently taking a writing class online, and just wrote a how-to article for one of my assignments. My teacher loved it and thought I could get it published. Problem is that I&#39;ve never had anything of mine published and I am not sure what the typical process is...<br /><br />Does anyone have any advice?

				Go to the bookstore and look at Writer&#39;s Market. It will offer detailed advice on how to approach various publishers and a list of magazines/book publishers/etc along with their requirements, whether or not they pay, what kind of material they are interested in, etc. <br /><br />Then, when you get published, be sure to tell us about it so we can buy the mag and read your article :)

				Thanks enigmacat. If I&#39;m near a bookstore today I&#39;ll see if I can find it.<br /><br />Am still interested in hearing anyone else&#39;s first-hand experiences/advice... At any rate, I hope that I can get this thing published, and I&#39;ll let you know if it does and where, etc.!

				Have you checked out www.mediabistro.com? They have lots of articles on getting published, etc. They also offer classes on how to get published, but not having taken the classes, I would think you can find the info elsewhere without shelling out so much money.<br /><br />I wish I had firsthand experience to share! I&#39;ve been wanting to do this too. My understanding though, is - it&#39;s not easy if you don&#39;t have initial clips published, so send to different places, expect some rejection, and start small. Websites or online magazines may be good to start with. Good luck!

				Just want to mention that if your on myspace that you can add &quot;Writers Market&quot; as a friend.-just do a search.<br />I am looking to get into the professional writing world also-its pretty challenging without having been published before but it is very possible. Good luck!

				Hello again, <br />I&#39;m not sure if this will interest you but it might be what your looking for to get started.<br />www.associatedcontent.com<br /><br />take a look, can&#39;t hurt. It involved getting published without much fuss.<br />Good luck,<br />Kelly

				Thanks for the Media Bistro link. That looks good - but yes, not sure if I want to fork over money.<br /><br />The Associated Content looks really interesting, kjaviator. I will have to look at it a bit more closely.<br /><br />I haven&#39;t tried submitting my article anywhere yet. Been too busy! First, I actually hope to expand the piece a bit, and then I&#39;ll try to start working on getting it published in a magazine or elsewhere...!

				It&#39;s a lot of work and you&#39;ll get a lot of rejections-- no matter how good you are.&nbsp; That doesn&#39;t mean you shouldn&#39;t try.<br /><br />I&#39;ve been pitching myself around lately and have had some luck, a lot of rejections, and a few stolen ideas.&nbsp; I wanted to get into food writing so I started a food blog (just braise) just over a year ago to loosen me up and get readers responses.&nbsp; A great way to start and now PR companies are contacting me to write up their restaurants (in exchange for a meal).&nbsp; This is great practice and can potentially be sold (I also post on Associated Content).<br /><br />I then read the book &quot;Will Write for Food.&quot;&nbsp; This book was really helpful in structuring a pitch and providing ideas.&nbsp; From there I pitched the magazine world.<br /><br />The trick is to be creative and think outside the box.&nbsp; Just because I want to write about food doesn&#39;t mean I should stick to food magazines.&nbsp; Nor do you have to stick to your geography (I just got something accepted for Time Out Chicago).&nbsp; But know that you&#39;ll get a lot of rejections, as well as some push (a food mag I contacted really liked a recent pitch of mine but told me they couldn&#39;t fit it into an upcoming mag and to pitch more in the future).&nbsp; <br /><br />I will say this: most freelancers find it close to impossible to live off writing alone.&nbsp; Many have part-time jobs.&nbsp; But it&#39;s a fun hobby...<br /><br />Good luck.

				I used to be a freelance magazine writer. It is a tough business to get into. I would figure out the right magazine for your article, look at the masthead and pick an editor (sr or assoc). Send him or her a letter with your piece. You might include a second idea in your letter. If you have any published articles include them as well. Tell the editor why your piece is good for the magazine. Call them a week later. It&#39;s a crapshoot but it may work out. I think I accepted a few articles, or at least got a few writers into my rotation, through that method (I was also an editor). <br /><br />Finding a connection to an editor is also helpful. Your teacher may have suggestions.<br /><br />best of luck!&nbsp;
