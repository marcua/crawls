				Hey all,<br /><br />I would like to throw myself upon the wisdom of Astorians.com...<br /><br />The heat in my apartment (included in the rent) has not yet been turned on. I didn&#039;t really care earlier, but now the mornings are starting to get pretty cold and I&#039;m a little worried. Someone in my office said they had to turn on heat by Oct 15 or when the temp got below 55, but those have both passed and I&#039;ve had no heat. I was also told that I should withhold rent until the heat is on and that this is within my rights. But I live in a three apartment building and I know the rules regarding those buildings are different. Also, my lease has nothing about heat or the date it has to go on, only that it is included in rent.<br /><br />Should I really withhold the rent? Does anyone here have a webpage I can look through that is about these smaller buildings?

				http://www.oag.state.ny.us/realestate/habitability.html<br /><br />Heat must be supplied from Oct. 1 through May 1 if the temperature outside falls below 55 degrees between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. (inside temp maintained at 68 degrees) and if the temperature outside falls below 40 degrees between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m., the inside must be maintained at 55. This law applies to multiple family dwellings, so your building qualifies. <br /><br />You need to call your landlord or superintendent before you start withholding rent--they might just be waiting to hear from you to save some $$. You can also call the Attorney General&#039;s Office to find out your next steps. <br /><br />DO NOT just stop paying rent. If you have to withhold rent for problems of habitability, there are specific steps you must take. You must continue to pay the rent into an escrow account, you must document that you have attempted to work with them to correct the problem, etc.

				My landlord is a 90 year old man that thinks that because he owns the building he can do whatever he wants (he has entered my apartment without notice).<br /><br />I printed out the law and mailed it to him anonymously, ever since he&#039;s been putting on the heat the way according to the law.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if he a) didn&#039;t know or b) got scared since he doesn&#039;t know where it&#039;s coming from.<br /><br />In my case I didn&#039;t bother to call him or tell him because since he is the King of his building he would have started yelling at me so I mailed it to him and my next step was to call 311.<br /><br />In your case since you&#039;ve already tried to contact him three times, just call 311, you don&#039;t have to have an account, they&#039;ll ask you for information and that&#039;s it, they&#039;ll connect you to the right person to speak, in most cases this is enough.

You need to call 311 to report it, repeatedly even, and you need to talk to the Attorney General&#039;s office before withholding rent. It would be better if you could get some of the other tenants in the building to withhold rent WITH you (through separate or the same escrow accounts). Definitely do NOT stop payment on a check you&#039;ve already sent him--that&#039;s antagonistic behavior and will not put you in the best light when you need to be seen as a good tenant. <br /><br />1. Call 311. Call every day while you&#039;re sorting out the rest of it. <br />2. Call the Attorney General&#039;s office and ask for guidelines on withholding rent in this situation. <br />3. Talk to your fellow tenants and see if anyone is interested in following those guidelines. Regardless, encourage them to call 311 with complaints. <br />4. Contact your landlord via certified mail, return receipt, mentioning the heating requirement law. Provide documentation that he is not meeting the law (one way to do this is to get an indoor/outdoor thermometer that shows the time and take pictures of it). Mention that you will be taking all steps legally available to you to restore the apartment to legal standards of habitability, up to and including withholding rent. Include that other tenants will be joining you in this, if applicable. <br />5. Follow the steps the AG office gives you for legal withholding of rent. <br /><br />I am not a lawyer. But at a previous apartment, these steps worked for me up to number 5--after I sent the letter, the heat came on.

				I agree that 311 should be called. The problem with calling 311 is that a housing inspector needs to be sent out and I don&#039;t think they give you a time (or even a day) as to when they&#039;re coming. If you have relationships with other neighbors, perhaps one that&#039;s home during the day, it would be best for them to also call 311. <br /><br />The heating requirements do not vary by the number of units in the building, but what does vary is your right to a renewal lease. It&#039;s easier for a rent stabilized tenant to make these kinds of complaints because they cannot be evicted for making these types of complaints. In an unregulated apt. building, the landlord doesn&#039;t have to give you a reason to not renew your lease (or to terminate a month-to-month tenancy). So, sometimes there&#039;s a fine line to walk because you may want to stay in the apartment in the long-run and the landlord may be vindictive. I like the idea of anonymously sending the heating season rules to the landlord (there&#039;s probably a flier on the HPD website). <br /><br />Don&#039;t withhold rent until all your other options are exhausted and document everything.

				I have the same problem.&nbsp; My landlord doesn&#039;t give a rats A$$ about us in the building.&nbsp; I called 311 last year and have started doing it again this year.&nbsp; My suggestion is to put in a complaint with 311 (it can be anonymous).&nbsp; Also, speak with your landlord.&nbsp; He might not know you aren&#039;t getting heat.&nbsp; If neither works, whatever you do, keep calling 311 this way there is a trail on him.

				I think this is a common problem for people who live in places where they can&#039;t control the heat themselves. Our heat actually did go on one night last week, which I was pretty excited about, but it hasn&#039;t been on since. I have four blankets on my bed. The thing is, I know that once the heat does go on (and inevitably it will when it gets to be frigid outside as opposed to just cold), it&#039;ll be on at full blast - along with the steam pipe making absurdly loud banging noises - and I&#039;ll wish that it wasn&#039;t.

I have asked many times for the landlord to change the timer because I am either leaving early for work or coming home late. The old setting had the lights turning off at 4am which made for a very noisy and dangerous coming home after a night out at the bar. Does anyone know anything about a &quot;light law&quot;? Also, how can I be anonymous at this point considering I have complained more than 3 times? (He has changed the lights each time I asked but I guess I should have asked for 24/7 from the get-go) I am not home during the day, so it doesn&#039;t really affect me, but I just think they should be on 24-7.<br /><br />

				Okay, so I definitely heard the heat come on last night, but it fired up for no more than a handful of minutes and when I woke up it was really no where near a reasonable warmth in my apartment.

The law clearly states the inside temperature that is to be maintained. However, that temperature still feels ridiculously cold to me. But if you want to be taken seriously when you complain legitimately, you need proof that your complaint is legitimate. The legal required temperature doesn&#039;t feel &quot;reasonable&quot; to me at all--but the landlord might be meeting the letter, if not the spirit, of the law. Besides, he doesn&#039;t have a thermostat in your apartment--now that he&#039;s turned it on and knows that you know the law, maybe you just need to remind him, &quot;Well, I know you turned it on, but the law states it needs to reach X at these hours, and I&#039;m looking at my thermometer and it&#039;s not there yet.&quot;

Is a generic cheap thermometer enough or should I be looking for something better? Anybody have any idea how much I should expect to pay for one that&#039;s good enough to read relatively accurately?

				We got ours at Radioshack, though I can&#039;t find it on their website. It was very generic--time, date, indoor/outdoor temps with a wire that went out the window and a sticky thing to stick it to the wall. Be careful when you close the window on the wire though--my boyfriend cut right through it the first time he put his up.

				Don&#039;t pay more than like $20.&nbsp; Mine reads inside/outside temperature.&nbsp; And keeps a max/min as well.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				This should do the trick and is available at your local Home Depot.<br /><br />http://www.homedepot.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?storeId=10051&amp;langId=-1&amp;catalogId=10053&amp;productId=100538655&amp;N=10000003+90401&amp;marketID=401&amp;locStoreNum=8125<br /><br />I can&#039;t attest to whether it does the trick or not since I don&#039;t own one (we haven&#039;t had any issues with our heat).&nbsp; This one is $14.99 but there is also another one on their site for $19.99<br /><br />Hope this helps!

				Hey paratactical, I wonder if we have the same landlord or live in the same place.&nbsp; Where do you live? It seems like we have the same problem at the same exact time.

				So... when I moved into my apt (a year ago) my landlord stated that he was going to replace the windows. The windows I have are probably as old as the prewar building that I live in...only two of them open and they are drafty as all get out. I can guarentee that the temperature in my apt (even with the heat on full blast) doesn&#039;t maintiain the temperature in the range stated on the rent guidelines board. Does that mean that he&#039;ll have to replace my windows?? It sure would make life a lot warmer!
