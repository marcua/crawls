				Turns out the Patriot Act could be used improperly.&nbsp; Gosh who knew.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Justice Dept.: FBI Misused Patriot Act<br />------------------------------<br />MANUEL BALCE CENETABy LARA JAKES JORDAN (Associated Press Writer)<br />From Associated Press<br />March 09, 2007 11:00 AM EST <br />------------------------------<br />WASHINGTON - The FBI improperly and, in some cases, illegally used the USA Patriot Act to secretly obtain personal information about people in the United States, underreporting for three years how often it forced businesses to turn over customer data, a Justice Department audit concluded Friday.<br /><br />FBI agents sometimes demanded the data without proper authorization, according to a 126-page audit by Justice Department Inspector General Glenn A. Fine. At other times, the audit found, the FBI improperly obtained telephone records in non-emergency circumstances.<br /><br />The audit blames agent error and shoddy record-keeping for the bulk of the problems and did not find any indication of criminal misconduct.<br /><br />Still, &quot;we believe the improper or illegal uses we found involve serious misuses of national security letter authorities,&quot; the audit concludes.<br /><br />At issue are the security letters, a power outlined in the Patriot Act that the Bush administration pushed through Congress after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. The letters, or administrative subpoenas, are used in suspected terrorism and espionage cases. They allow the FBI to require telephone companies, Internet service providers, banks, credit bureaus and other businesses to produce highly personal records about their customers or subscribers - without a judge&#039;s approval.<br /><br />FBI Director Robert S. Mueller called Fine&#039;s audit &quot;a fair and objective review of the FBI&#039;s use of a proven and useful investigative tool.&quot;<br /><br />The finding &quot;of deficiencies in our processes is unacceptable,&quot; Mueller said in a statement.<br /><br />&quot;We strive to exercise our authorities consistent with the privacy protections and civil liberties that we are sworn to uphold,&quot; Mueller said. &quot;Anything less will not be tolerated. While we&#039;ve already taken some steps to address these shortcomings, I am ordering additional corrective measures to be taken immediately.&quot;<br /><br />Fine&#039;s annual review is required by Congress, over the objections of the Bush administration.<br /><br />The audit released Friday found that the number of national security letters issued by the FBI skyrocketed in the years after the Patriot Act became law.<br /><br />In 2000, for example, the FBI issued an estimated 8,500 letters. By 2003, however, that number jumped to 39,000. It rose again the next year, to about 56,000 letters in 2004, and dropped to approximately 47,000 in 2005.<br /><br />Over the entire three-year period, the audit found the FBI issued 143,074 national security letters requesting customer data from businesses.<br /><br />The FBI vastly underreported the numbers. In 2005, the FBI told Congress that its agents in 2003 and 2004 had delivered only 9,254 national security letters seeking e-mail, telephone or financial information on 3,501 U.S. citizens and legal residents over the previous two years.<br /><br />Additionally, the audit found, the FBI identified 26 possible violations in its use of the national security letters, including failing to get proper authorization, making improper requests under the law and unauthorized collection of telephone or Internet e-mail records.<br /><br />Of the violations, 22 were caused by FBI errors, while the other four were the result of mistakes made by the firms that received the letters.<br /><br />

				This would not be too surprising.<br />I was amazed when I understood some conservatives believe the executive now has carte blanche.<br />And that if you want a change, you need a change of executive.<br />Term limits will do some good in 2008.<br />(Unless Congress sees reason to be proactive before then. However, Bush was <em>elected</em> twice.?)<br /><br />After that, it is up to the voters (and maybe the courts ...).<br />Should it be a surprise there are so few departures from the White House and that Congress has largely gone along with the executive demands.<br />&nbsp;:x<br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_PATRIOT_Act<br /><br /><br />http://www.bordc.org/<br /><br />Bill of Rights Defense Committee

				<br />** Perhaps a surprising victory for the bill of rights (but maybe temporary) **<br /><br /><br /><strong>Appeals court overturns D.C. gun ban </strong> <br />By BRETT ZONGKER, Associated Press Writer<br />Fri Mar 9<br /><br /><br />A federal appeals court overturned the District of Columbia&#039;s long-standing handgun ban Friday, rejecting the city&#039;s argument that the Second Amendment right to bear arms applied only to militias.<br /><br />In a 2-1 decision, the judges held that the activities protected by the Second Amendment &quot;are not limited to militia service, nor is an individual&#039;s enjoyment of the right contingent&quot; on enrollment in a militia.<br /><br />The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that the city cannot prevent people from keeping handguns in their homes. The ruling also struck down a requirement that owners of registered firearms must keep them unloaded and disassembled. The court did not address provisions that prohibit people from carrying unregistered guns outside the home.<br /><br /><strong>D.C. Mayor Adrian Fenty said the city plans to appeal.</strong><br /><br />&quot;I am personally, deeply disappointed and quite frankly outraged,&quot; Fenty said.<br /><br />Washington and Chicago are the only two major U.S. cities with sweeping handgun bans. Washington&#039;s ban on owning handguns went into effect in 1976, and is considered to be the toughest in the nation, according to the National Rifle Association. While courts in other parts of the country have upheld bans on automatic weapons and sawed-off shotguns, the D.C. law is unusual because it involves a prohibition on all pistols.<br /><br />In 2004, a lower-court judge told six city residents that they did not have a constitutional right to own handguns. The plaintiffs include residents of high-crime neighborhoods who wanted the guns for protection.<br /><br />But on Friday, Judge Laurence Silberman, writing for the majority, said &quot;The district&#039;s definition of the militia is just too narrow. There are too many instances of &#039;bear arms&#039; indicating private use to conclude that the drafters intended only a military sense.&quot;<br /><br />Judge Karen Henderson dissented, writing that the Second Amendment does not apply to the District of Columbia because it is not a state.<br /><br />The Bush administration has endorsed individual gun-ownership rights, but the Supreme Court has never settled the issue. If the dispute makes it to the high court, it would be the first case in nearly 70 years to address the Second Amendment&#039;s scope.<br /><br />&quot;I think this is well positioned for review of the Supreme Court,&quot; said Jonathan Turley, a constitutional law professor at George Washington University.<br /><br />Even as the appeals court overturned the city&#039;s 1976 ban on most handgun ownership, Silberman wrote that the Second Amendment is still &quot;subject to the same sort of reasonable restrictions that have been recognized as limiting, for instance, the First Amendment.&quot;<br /><br />Such restrictions might include gun registration, firearms testing to promote public safety or restrictions on gun ownership for criminals or those deemed mentally ill.<br /><br />___<br /><br />Associated Press Writers Stephen Manning in Washington and David Dishneau in Hagerstown, Md., contributed to this story.<br />
