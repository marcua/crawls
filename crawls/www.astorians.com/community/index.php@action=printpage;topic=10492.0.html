				This is the caliber of the republic presidential nominees for 2008. Huckabee jokes about somebody taking a shot at Barack Obama!!&#160; :x<br /><br />http://uk.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUKN1644849320080516<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former Republican presidential contender Mike Huckabee, interrupted on Friday by a loud crash as he spoke to the National Rifle Association, joked that the noise was Democratic candidate Barack Obama falling off a chair as he dodged a gun aimed at him.&#160; :idiot:<br /><br />&quot;That was Barack Obama. He just tripped off a chair. He was getting ready to speak and somebody aimed a gun at him, and he dove for the floor,&quot; Huckabee told the NRA convention in Louisville, Kentucky, in comments that aired on CNN.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />And this guy&#039;s a former &quot;minister&quot; who ran for president. The mentality of republican nominees are just alternate versions of the Bushies. He&#039;s basically saying it&#039;s open season to take out Obama.<br /><br />Huckabee should go duck hunting with Cheney if he&#039;s such a big fan of people getting shot at.&#160; :killme:<br /><br />

				Yikes. <br /><br />I am really sick of all this racism in this campaign. I get it&#039;s there and it&#039;s real and it&#039;s not going to go away (believe me, I know - I grew up in the South), but it still incenses me to no end that people are refusing to vote for Obama because of his skin color and their perceived understanding of the black community. Mike Huckabee sure isn&#039;t helping things either. This type of dialog/commentary only enables racism.<br /><br />Did anybody see this insightful, yet humorous (as always), piece on The Daily Show (http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=168561&amp;title=indecision-2008-west-virginia)?

				Some of these candidates are obviously missing the &#039;editing chip&#039; in their brains.&nbsp; They say things without thinking.&nbsp; This was a very ill-timed and unfortunate &#039;joke&#039;.&nbsp; <br /><br />I wonder if guns were around back when Jesus was put on the cross.&nbsp; Would they have shot him instead?&nbsp;

My point being - Mike Huckabee&#039;s generation is more likely to be racist than someone in my generation 20s/30s where we are used to cultures blending and coming together more often. Yes, it&#039;s true that people in my generation can say this sort of thing, but I think that older generations who were more steeped in blatant racism are more likely to say these sorts of thing and not think that they said anything controversial/offensive.<br /><br />Perhaps he didn&#039;t mean it as racist, but it certainly came across that way. Would he have said the same thing about Hilary Clinton?

Having visited the rural south many times and being Asian, I wasn&#039;t the subject of too much of it(because apparently Asians are the &quot;safe&quot; race&nbsp; :roll:), but I witnessed enough of it.<br />I do believe in this instance, that it was more of a dig on the &quot;Liberals want to take away your 2nd Amendment rights&quot; propaganda. I do believe he would have said the same thing about Hillary and it wouldn&#039;t have been a misogynistic comment. <br />I think there is a lot more to tie Huckabee to being a racist than that comment- starting with his relationship with the Council of Conservative Citizens, an organization that is deeply rooted in a history of fighting for segregation.

				Huckabee made a not so smart joke, it happens to everyone.&nbsp; &nbsp;I also don&#039;t think White people are not voting for Obama because he is Black.&nbsp; He is getting more support from White voters than Clinton is from Black voters.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				OK, Huckabee joking about Obama&nbsp; falling out of chair&nbsp; cause he thought someone was pointing a&nbsp; gun at him was a dumb joke, after he heard some sound of something falling backstage, but, I wonder&nbsp; where&nbsp; all those people&nbsp; &#039;concerned&#039; with this remark were, when a&nbsp; movie&nbsp; actually showing Bush being assasinated&nbsp; was&nbsp; made. BTW, That movie wasn&#039;t joking.

				Wow. It was a joke. Get over it.<br /><br />Dave Chappelle makes jokes about Obama getting assassinated. They&#039;re funny; he&#039;s black. So it&#039;s okay.<br /><br />Huckster made a stupid joke. It wasn&#039;t funny; he&#039;s white. Not okay? Huh? <br /><br />Lambast the guy cause the joke was lame. Have a sense of humor, yo.<br /><br />This lady on NPR the other day was all up in arms over the sexists telling Hillary to &quot;iron their shirts&quot; or what ever other jokes they made. Oh, no. So unfair. <br /><br />We make jokes about Bush being Texan all the time. Being President or a celebrity makes you fair game for humor. Deal with it.

				Huckabee is governor of Arkansas, a former republican presidential candidate, and supposedly on the short list of McCain&#039;s veep choices. It&#039;s not the same thing as a comedian doing a bad taste routine, or a regular citizen making a snide remark to friends. This was a high profile elected politician in front of a NRA audience who may already have issues that there is a democratic front-runner with a different skin color than theirs. If Obama had made a similiar horrible remark against McCain, I would have serious second thoughts about voting for him. Perhaps I expect more from presidential candidates than some others do?<br />

				oh man .. I watched Carlos Mencia&#039;s Performance Enhanced special today on Comedy Central (I was expecting something more tasteful ... like Futurama 8-)) and he did this whole ridiculous bit about &#039;White Guilt&#039; and how white people are constantly more subjected to being called &#039;racist&#039; for any &#039;colorful&#039; remarks - he did this whole thing about Eminem rapping about killing his own mother and using the word cracker but refusing to say the &#039;N&#039; word ...&nbsp; :lmao: .. I know it&#039;s so bad but it&#039;s just so funny.. this thread reminded me of it. I really did try to youtube it but there&#039;s nothing yet only some bit about vegetarians. <br /><br />&nbsp;:-P
