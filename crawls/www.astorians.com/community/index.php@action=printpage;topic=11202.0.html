				Now, before&nbsp; we get&nbsp; into who is more&nbsp; compassionate, or there goes this right-wingnut again railing against homesless&nbsp; folks. Let me say&nbsp; that I have contributed much time, to homeless&nbsp; vets, worked in soup&nbsp; kitchens&nbsp; and helped stock pantry&#039;s&nbsp; over the years, and on holidays, while others were having a great weekend. I&#039;m not saying this to blow my own horn, or to point out how great&nbsp; a guy I am, although, &#039;we&#039; all know that to be true.&nbsp; :lol:&nbsp; <br /><br />Seriously, over the years, I have noticed it gets&nbsp; worse in the summer. In my neighborhood, a few blocks from the supermarket, the &#039;bottle&#039; guys who congregate, sit on milk&nbsp; cartoons and drink themselves&nbsp; to uncosciousness&nbsp; is&nbsp; bad enough, but, when they sneak into your&nbsp; yards and defecate&nbsp; and&nbsp; urinate, steal bikes, and in general create a nuisance or try to get into basements, it&#039;s out&nbsp; of&nbsp; control, again. During Mayor&nbsp; Guilianis&nbsp; tenure, it&nbsp; had gotten better, but, it&#039;s getting bad again, not 70s-80&#039;s&nbsp; bad , yet,&nbsp; thankfully, but, bad. There is&nbsp; these&nbsp; half dozen guys, most likely either&nbsp; illegal aliens, since I&#039;ve tried to speak to at least two and they have no clue about english, none, zero, and they are not faking&nbsp; it. <br /><br />The truth is&nbsp; to get a handle&nbsp; on this problem, people&nbsp; have to be taken off streets and evaluated, mentally ill, drug and alcohol problems&nbsp; have to be separated from those who are just die hard criminals or people who are here illegally and should be deported. This is also a federal problem, but, locally, the city should do alot more, and could do it. Unfortunately, we&nbsp; have judges&nbsp; like&nbsp; this &#039;Sweet&#039;, from a NY Times&nbsp; article.. “In 1992, a federal judge in Manhattan, Robert W. Sweet, ruled that a state law prohibiting begging on the streets was unconstitutional….Judge Sweet, citing the First Amendment’s guarantee of the right to free speech, ordered the New York Police Department to stop issuing summonses for begging on the street. He even directed the police to stop telling beggars on the sidewalk to “move along.” <br /><br />This sort&nbsp; of&nbsp; nonsense, coupled&nbsp; with de-institutionalisation of the&nbsp; late 70&#039;s and early 80&#039;s, has made it into a&nbsp; chronic problem. Granted, there&nbsp; are&nbsp; socio-economic reasons&nbsp; for many folks to be out there, including, sadly, families, but, we&nbsp; are not talking about those folks. These people are chronic, and in some cases, violent people. One time, I nearly ran over&nbsp; a guys legs, lying under a black&nbsp; plastic bag, in a driveway, in the rain at night, where I was going on a job.&nbsp; :-(&nbsp; This person, for whatever&nbsp; reason, should not be &#039;outside.&#039; Obviously he has lost all sense&nbsp; of reality. When I got out, and removed the bag to see what was under, he pulled at it and mumbled something. I called&nbsp; an ambulance and he was taken away. No one should be allowed&nbsp; to block sidewalks or loiter all day outside&nbsp; homes and business&#039;s. It&#039;s not a &#039;right&#039; to be in the street, it&#039;s a disgrace, it devalues&nbsp; the neighborhood and is potentially&nbsp; dangerous&nbsp; on a whole host of levels. <br /><br />As for&nbsp; the local problem, all I got from 114 Community Affairs is, call us if you see&nbsp; someone lying on the sidewalk. Well, folks, someone&nbsp; drinking&nbsp; on the sidewalk, with his shopping cart buddies, all day, when I go to work, will end up in someone&#039;s back yard, or&nbsp; my&nbsp; sidewalk, as sure&nbsp; as I&#039;m sitting&nbsp; here.&nbsp; Children and families&nbsp; live here, and seeing these&nbsp; guys urinating against&nbsp; the building, sometimes&nbsp; making lewd&nbsp; remarks, to women passing by, should&nbsp; be&nbsp; stopped, now. Let&#039;s&nbsp; separate&nbsp; the truly bad off folks, from the &#039;bad&#039;&nbsp; people, who are lumped&nbsp; together&nbsp; as&nbsp; &#039;homeless.&#039; Otherwise, the problem will get worse for the &#039;working class&#039;, and nothing will be done for those in genuine&nbsp; need of help. <br /><br />

				Here is how you get rid of this &quot;homeless problem&quot;. First, you order the development of affordable housing (not the BS affordable housing you hear Bloomberg and all our other electeds bragging about... but real affordable housing). Then, you create jobs by getting rid of the incentive for corporations to send jobs overseas (IE: repeal NAFTA and all other &quot;free trade&quot; agreements). Then, you build more homeless shelters and help homeless people find jobs and eventually get affordable housing. This should help get many of the homeless people off the streets. <br />And then.... you increase the graduation rates at schools to over 99 percent, because since half of our kids aren&#039;t currently graduating high school, they have to go somewhere, and while I&#039;m sure not all homeless people didn&#039;t graduate, many of them probably didn&#039;t. Allowing our kids to go into society without being educated is grounds for disaster. We have to make sure that tomorrow&#039;s generation does not end up with a lot of people being homeless. <br /><br />Of course, this is just a very general and nonspecific plan to help address the &quot;homeless problem&quot;. I&#039;m sure a bunch of people will say this involves too much government spending and such.... but hey..... if anyone else has any better ideas I&#039;d like to hear them.

				if people are disrupting your home environment, such as littering, causing noise, DEFFECATING on your property, or getting into your basement, those are crimes. call the police and have them removed. <br /><br />getting affordable housing is a monster for all in the nyc area, and is a longeterm solution that will not be solved immediately.

I acknowledge merely treating economic inequality will not solve the &quot;homeless problem&quot; alone but is a necessary step. Society needs to begin to see that someone being homeless is not just the fault of the person being homeless but is the fault of society as a whole, which is why we must come together and find long term solutions! If it takes a million years to dramatically decrease and/or eliminate homelessness then it is well worth it since it will be a greater place for our descendants and the world they live in.

The problem is that I&#039;ve known people who chose to be homeless or squatters. They&#039;ve been some of the most intelligent, interesting and passionate folks I&#039;ve known, but for one reason or another, they refused to have jobs, pay rent or the like. They preferred hitching from one town to the next with the seasons and finding abandonned places to make their stays. While there have been people doing this that I&#039;ve gotten very close to, I don&#039;t think society should be obligated to pay to &quot;fix&quot; their problems. There are already housing programs for the first few months on your feet or groups who help get you attire for interviews and these guys that I knew were smart enough to know about them, but didn&#039;t want involved.<br /><br /><br />But on the other hand, I&#039;ve known homeless people who were veterans abandonned after the military hospital in Boston shut down. They are not well. They cannot hold jobs or care for themselves. They need assistance.<br /><br />In rural PA, where I grew up, we all knew which bums were which. It was a small town. We knew David was a vet who needed our money and if he was spending it on beer, well, so be it, he was a vet and he was harmless but crazy. We also knew Jimmy was just a lazy ass who&#039;d been given job after job and just quit because he didn&#039;t want to work. One guy got money from the folk in town, one didn&#039;t. <br /><br />I guess I am pretty favorable in giving and helping those who can&#039;t help themselves, but in a city as big as this, how do you know who is who? That&#039;s why I chose to give to the charaties that help the homeless rather than the people directly.

				One of the biggest problems is that a lot of them don&#039;t want anyone&#039;s help. For whatever reason, they&#039;ve either given up on life and they&#039;re just waiting for their own death, or they are completely insane. Like Para, I have also known people who have chosen to be homeless. People my age, and people much older. And in my experience, the young ones usually can go &#039;home&#039; they have family or friends who have offered them a place to stay, but they are either too stubborn or too busy &#039;finding themselves&#039; I don&#039;t agree with their choice but at the same time, they don&#039;t agree with mine so who&#039;s got the right to judge who? A lot of times the older men are vets. And in fact, a lot of them would rather be homeless than work for the man or pay taxes to the government that fucked them in one way or another. Also, to repeat Starwind&#039;s point, just because people you see in the streets look homeless, doesn&#039;t mean they are. Let&#039;s put it this way: if they are in fact <em>homeless</em> how come you always see the same guys in the same places? You can&#039;t force people to do what they don&#039;t want to do. Don&#039;t the homeless have &#039;rights&#039; too? Are they not citizens? Once they become disruptive by harassing people or trespassing, then they ought to be thrown in jail and mentally evaluated. But, just because we don&#039;t like seeing them sitting on the street, doesn&#039;t mean they haven&#039;t got the right to be there if they choose to. You don&#039;t own public sidewalks.

For whatever reason, they&#039;ve either given up on life and they&#039;re just waiting for their own death, or they are completely insane. Like Para, I have also known people who have chosen to be homeless. People my age, and people much older. And in my experience, the young ones usually can go &#039;home&#039; they have family or friends who have offered them a place to stay, but they are either too stubborn or too busy &#039;finding themselves&#039; I don&#039;t agree with their choice but at the same time, they don&#039;t agree with mine so who&#039;s got the right to judge who? A lot of times the older men are vets. And in fact, a lot of them would rather be homeless than work for the man or pay taxes to the government that fucked them in one way or another. Also, to repeat Starwind&#039;s point, just because people you see in the streets look homeless, doesn&#039;t mean they are. Let&#039;s put it this way: if they are in fact <em>homeless</em> how come you always see the same guys in the same places? You can&#039;t force people to do what they don&#039;t want to do. Don&#039;t the homeless have &#039;rights&#039; too? Are they not citizens? Once they become disruptive by harassing people or trespassing, then they ought to be thrown in jail and mentally evaluated. But, just because we don&#039;t like seeing them sitting on the street, doesn&#039;t mean they haven&#039;t got the right to be there if they choose to. You don&#039;t own public sidewalks. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Ahh, actually&nbsp; &#039;I&#039; do own the &#039;public&#039; sidewalks, I&#039;m a taxpayer, and these people&nbsp; are not and do commit crimes. People work and can&#039;t be there all day watching these guys, who amongst&nbsp; them will admit defecating and urinating in your yard? When my recycling is mixed and trash is dumped&nbsp; out by them, I&#039;m the guy who gets&nbsp; the ticket, not joe schmoe who &#039;chose&#039;&nbsp; to be in the street. I have&nbsp; worked&nbsp; with homeless vets, these guys &#039;ain&#039;t&#039; it.&nbsp; No one&nbsp; has the &#039;right&#039; to block streets, sidewalks&nbsp; and there&nbsp; are laws against menacing and loitering.

				I am steadfastly against the construction of affordable housing in Astoria.<br /><br />The construction of affordable housing will result in a small percentage of the rental units being &quot;affordable housing&quot;.&nbsp; They will be ugly, they will be poorly designed and they will soon become the highly coveted domains of lucky citizens who pass these rental units down from generation to generation until the city decides to let them go condo, whereupon they become subject to market forces and allows a handful of people to fall backwards into being millionaires.&nbsp; Furthermore, the construction of these units will not lower the overall rents in Astoria.&nbsp; The existence of affordable housing will increase the demand for housing in Astoria, so that the pre-construction market equilibrium will be obtained within a few years (a great parallel are traffic studies and the traffic generation which accompanies each new traffic lane or redundant bridge).&nbsp; This will cause an increased population density in Astoria, which, without a massive public investment in our mass transit options, will result in increased number of posters calling myself and my co-workers corrupt incompetents in the &quot;my subway ride to work sucked&quot; thread, which of course, is always an informative pleasure to read.<br /><br />I know its not a trump card, but as an urban planner, I have seen the government attempts at housing, either low or middle income.&nbsp; At best, they are grudgingly passable uses of public space and monies.&nbsp; At worst, they are absolute train wrecks which destroy neighborhoods and make a few contractors rich at the expense of schmucks like me.&nbsp; For the most part, housing is a private matter and ought to be built by private interests who are regulated by the government.&nbsp; Public housing is a viable option not in neighborhoods which have a robust housing market, but rather in ones which do not.&nbsp; They can also be useful when it is advisible to increase population densities and a conscious effort is made to do so.&nbsp; Finally they can be viable in areas where the private interests are not willing to invest in and the use of such public monies is actually an investment as a pallitive for the lower classes.&nbsp; Astoria does not fit into any of those three.&nbsp; Building affordable housing in Astoria will have the same effect on housing prices as us destroying our national treasures to drill for oil.&nbsp;

				It is true, I am an urban planner for the rich&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />You can&#039;t argue with market forces when it comes to housing.&nbsp; Every time the government does, it loses.&nbsp; Affordable housing will result in a few lucky ones getting their pad subsidized by John Q.

Some companies are worse than others but to deny any correlation between the size of a company and an increase in bureaucracy and inefficiency would be ludicrous. Additionally, you have the fact that the private sector does what is best for itself and for their shareholders with little regard for anything else (people, the environment etc.) The MTA is a great example.

				Let me tell you a tale of the efficiency of the private sector.<br /><br />The UK privatized it&#039;s railways and partially privatized the London Underground about 10 years ago in a bid to run the services more efficiently and provide relief for the taxpayer.<br /><br />The result, at least on the Tube, is a service that’s as least as good or bad as the New York City Subway, depending on your viewpoint, and fares that cause grown men to weep. They are astronomical, which would be fine except taxpayer subsidies are as high as they were before the systems were privatized.<br /><br />Why is this? Because when you privatize, you add another interest group: the fatcats in the financial sector who need to get their cut of the transit dollar(pound) pie.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />A weekly ticket on the Tube for Zones 1 &amp; 2 (central London only) is £24.20 or nearly $50; a monthly will set you back £93 or just over $180.<br /><br />A weekly ticket on the tube for Zones 1 &amp; 6 (which covers the entire city) is £44.60 or nearly $90; a monthly will set you back £171.30 – nearly $350!<br /><br />This is in supposedly “socialist” Great Britain. <br /><br />In New York: system-wide a weekly MetroCard is $25; a monthly $81<br /><br />God Bless the MTA! <br />

Ridership is at an all time high but projects are seemingly getting axed left and right. G train riders are getting the shaft in addition to many &quot;service improvements&quot; being cut. The fulton street transit center, 7 train extension, 2nd avenue subway and other large projects are just spewing bad news. &quot;Cost overages, delays, revised plans etc etc.&quot; How about the MTA board members, whom up until it was all over the press, received all sorts of transit subsidies and benefits? Don&#039;t even get me started on pay....<br /><br />Meanwhile large private projects, CitiField is a good example, continue on schedule and on budget. This is despite using &quot;expensive&quot; union labor. Now you have me sounding like Billz&nbsp; :-D

I think what originally irked me about your statement, the impression I got, (and I believe I was mistaken), was that you meant someone who&#039;s rich daddy got him a job schmoozing fat cats for a salary that rivals that of say, rocket scientists, deserves to be better off than the mom with 3 small kids who&#039;s husband has died/left/whatever, and now she&#039;s stuck to support them alone working 3 jobs meanwhile the kids aren&#039;t getting the nurturing they need ... well you get my point, I think.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=11202.msg140511#msg140511">Quote from: Billz1981 on July 17, 2008, 12:28:52 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">But sadly, I&#039;m not a red stater. &nbsp;I&#039;m not even from very far away. &nbsp;Grew up on Long Island, went to college at Fordham, moved to Astoria after graduating about four years ago. &nbsp;Not sure what my excuse is for being a conservative. &nbsp;But I&#039;m actually a moderate conservative. &nbsp;Most of the views I am espousing are not very far to the right. &nbsp;They&#039;re actually just bedrock principles of the conservative movement. &nbsp;Small government with minimal intrusions into private life, low taxes, looking to people rather than government for solutions, etc.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Actually, it&#039;s not that surprising to me. I think I see now where our differences in opinion come from. When you speak of &#039;class inequality&#039; (I know that wasn&#039;t the exact phrase, but when you talk about redistribution of wealth, then class inequality is pretty much right there with it) my first thought is of people who got screwed over in life, for various reasons, to little or no fault of their own. I think of small families with only a handful of people to turn to. I think of the teenager who couldn&#039;t go to school every day because someone needed to care for the sick mom or dad, of the 20 something who couldn&#039;t afford college because of inherited financial problems, the 30 somethings couple who had decent jobs, a home, and when their planned out baby arrived, he/she developed a rare form of god-knows-what and suddenly the electricity bill became a challenge, the 40 somethings who had a jackass financial advisor, the 50 something who just got laid off from the company she worked for for 30 years because the economy is making them down-size, the 60 something who never imagined that all the saving they&#039;d done wouldn&#039;t be enough, the 70 something who can barely get out of bed to go to work in the morning, but has no choice because they didn&#039;t have enough, the 80 something who can&#039;t afford her pills, etc. <br />I do not immediately think of the immigrant family with a mom, a dad, 7 kids, two uncles, 2 sets of grandparents, who are all living in a 3 bedroom apartment in jackson heights, and living off of $60gs a year total. And don&#039;t think I&#039;m a racist anti-immigrant KKK lunatic, because I&#039;m not. In reality, my 5 closest friends (boyfriend included) were born in other countries. Uzbekistan, Mexico, Colombia, and DR in case anyone&#039;s wondering. 3/5 of them are citizens now! But when &#039;class inequalities&#039; and &#039;the role of government in redistribution of wealth&#039; comes up, I don&#039;t think about my immigrant friends, much less immigrants who aren&#039;t people I see every day. They deserve their rights and all, and I don&#039;t think I&#039;m any better than anyone for having been born here, the only reason I think of American-born citizens first, is that we didn&#039;t have a choice. Immigrant families typically come from countries that are poorer than the US. Well, duh, ten years ago weren&#039;t like 95% of the countries in the world poorer than us? However they made that choice to leave where they were and come here, in search of a better life. And that&#039;s great. But, well, you didn&#039;t have to come here. You could have gone to the UK, where from my understanding (based on what has been posted in this thread about their universal healthcare and more entitlements) you might get more government hand-outs.<br />Sorry I realize I went off on a tangent there (I&#039;m not a racist!!!!!) but back to my point of why I think of American-born citizens who suffer from class inequalities, is because, well I&#039;m one of them. (haha, surprise!) I even fit in to one of those examples I gave! Don&#039;t get me wrong, I&#039;m not looking for anyone&#039;s sympathy on this board, I don&#039;t need it, I don&#039;t want it. I&#039;m explaining this ... because I feel like it. So there. I&#039;m not going to sit here and complain that I didn&#039;t have as many opportunities growing up, because I had plenty, and I spat in their faces. Now, I am going to have to work my <strong><em>ass</em></strong> off if I want a better life, and I am prepared to do so. <br />Billz, I am very glad you didn&#039;t get offended, and offered up a little backround on yourself. Here is my opinion, and only that, I mean no offense, I am only stating what I perceive: You obviously are a very level-headed dude, and that&#039;s cool. You came from LI, got a nice private-school education, and I&#039;m going to venture a guess that you now work in the city and chose to live in Astoria because of it&#039;s proximity to the city, and because it&#039;s a generally awesome area&nbsp; (:mrgreen:) But I&#039;ll bet once you get married and have kids you&#039;re heading back east or maybe up north. I think that based on where you came from, you have spent more time around people who come from money. Even I&#039;m totally off, and you came from a piss poor family who happened to inherit a house (or something) and you worked your ass off and got a full scholarship to Fordham, in a place like that, you are bound to have been exposed to those mild conservative ideas. <br />I think that&#039;s really the only place we see differently, is I&#039;m thinking in defense of people who got fucked by life, and you are thinking in defense of people who have, and why shouldn&#039;t they after all? And to an extent, I agree with you. If I busted my ass and worked hard for an education, that landed me a job I worked hard at, to get paid the big bucks, I&#039;d be pretty pissed off too if someone said &#039;You have more than me so I deserve some of yours!&#039; <br />My problem, and my issue with &#039;class inequalities&#039; is that I don&#039;t think it&#039;s fair that I get taxed at a higher percentage than you. I understand that people with higher income tend to give more to individual charities, and that&#039;s supposed to be their way of helping, but people like me don&#039;t know from charities. People that have more money can spend it on the &#039;private&#039; stuff, like healthcare and education, but I can&#039;t agree that it&#039;s fair that they get to contribute less to the public stuff, like education, healthcare, and public services such as cops and libraries. I understand that they won&#039;t use public education or healthcare, or libraries, because they&#039;ve got the private stuff they can pay for, but if they would give a little more of what they already have, maybe we could work toward getting the public stuff up to par with the private stuff, and then they could use it too. <br />And I truly don&#039;t understand what you mean about the private sector. You need money to be able to afford anything with the word &#039;private&#039; in it. I think we all deserve to be taxed equally, and I also think that the government wouldn&#039;t be so bad if it would stop being so useless and corrupt. I can&#039;t say I am against big government because I do not understand the alternative. <br />To get back to the topic of housing, I don&#039;t necessarily think public housing is the answer to &#039;affordable housing&#039;&nbsp; When I think of &#039;affordable housing&#039; I think of $600 a month rent for a studio. Is that insane? That&#039;s not housing prices. That&#039;s like a few years ago prices! I don&#039;t agree with longtime residents getting priced out of the area. I&#039;ve already realized I won&#039;t be able to own a home in the neighborhood I grew up in. That&#039;s really sad, cuz I like it here, but I will never be able to afford it. Median income is 100gs a year. I never thought I&#039;d <em>ever</em> make that much as an annual salary.

				Duska,<br />Thanks for your thoughtful post.&nbsp; I&#039;m not able to give it the response it deserves, because I&#039;m at work.&nbsp; But I&#039;ll try to do the short version, anyhow.<br /><br />Not to get uncomfortably personal, and I know it has little to do with the discussion.&nbsp; But I grew up on the South Shore of Long Island (not the North Shore, which tends to be where the money is at).&nbsp; My parents divorced at a very early age, so my brother and I were raised by a single mom who always struggled to make ends meet.&nbsp; She spent much of our younger childhood doing daycare in the home because that way she could earn some money, but still be there to raise us.&nbsp; My grandparents on both sides grew up in Queens and then moved to Long Island.&nbsp; My father&#039;s parents as original Levittowners.&nbsp; So in a way, my living in Queens is a return to the land of my forebearers, if you want to be overly dramatic about it. :-)&nbsp; Went to public school, worked my ass off, was in the top 10 of my high school class, and then went to Fordham.<br /><br />At Fordham, as well as in high school, I was just about the only conservative I was knew of.&nbsp; My conservatism probably developed in part as a reaction to my modest upbringing.&nbsp; I subscribe (at least somewhat) to the argument that great society entitlement programs have made things worse for the working poor.&nbsp; (For a brilliant account of this argument, see &quot;Losing Ground&quot; by Charles Murray).&nbsp; I work a modest think tank job, and I don&#039;t make the big bucks (yet.&nbsp; Fingers crossed).<br /><br />I know there is much to say about your post, and I feel bad for not being able to do give you a proper response right now.&nbsp; I will say that while the poor are taxed as a higher percentage of their income, the rich actually provide the lions share of tax revenue in this country.&nbsp; The rich are also, obviously, responsible for more of the employment and economic activity that we all benefit from.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure that we&#039;ll ever be able to separate government and corruption.<br /><br />Have you ever read Atlas Shrugged?&nbsp; This conversation is touching upon many of the themes... <br /><br />

				I have read Atlas Shrugged, never heard of Murray. I guess u could say I&#039;m on the fence about the issue, because I agree and disagree with aspects of both sides. I also threw Atlas across a room on two occasions. Not to spoil it for anyone who hasn&#039;t read it, but the first occasion involved a plane in the mountains, the second, an 18 page radio speech. <br />I guess I overreached in my attempt to better understand the backround of your ideals (on the subject) <br />I don&#039;t think there is any easy answer to be honest, but I don&#039;t think anyone can be comfortable with everyone&#039;s favorite statistic, that the top 1% has more wealth than the bottom 90% combined. Now in my head, the next thought that pops up is the irony, that historically speaking, the top 1% gain wealth by exploiting the bottom percentage in one way or another.<br />I suppose I&#039;ve run out of explanations of my views. And I certainly wish I had more / better ideas for a resolution to the issues.&nbsp; &nbsp;

I agree with what you say too. People who have worked hard and earned accumulated wealth, shouldn&#039;t be forced to pay for the lazy drunk that won&#039;t get a job. <br />But at the same time I wouldn&#039;t want to be stuck in a situation where I can&#039;t earn a living based on circumstances beyond my control, and I don&#039;t think anyone else should be stuck in that situation either. The only solution I see, is for the rich to give to the poor. The only way I can think of that happening is through taxation.

				This has turned out as&nbsp; a great discussion about the socio-economic reasons&nbsp; and solutions&nbsp; for homeless&nbsp; folks or genuine&nbsp; people&nbsp; in need, and I am all for my taxes helping those folks. What my intial post was refering too is weeding those folks from what were commonly refered&nbsp; to when I&nbsp; was a&nbsp; kid, bums and criminals. It amounts&nbsp; to&nbsp; stalking, hanging out in a neighborhood you don&#039;t live&nbsp; in and no one knows you, drinking beer, &#039;checking out&#039; who comes&nbsp; and goes and snooping in yards, hallways. Once you get a&nbsp; group&nbsp; like that hanging out in your neighborhood, &#039;things&#039;&nbsp; start&nbsp; to get stolen, women get harrassed, not to mention bottles broken and&nbsp; fights&nbsp; breaking out amongst&nbsp; the denizens of the sidewalk. Sure, I see the &#039;shopping cart&#039; guys, pass through many times, an old man who bothers&nbsp; no one, on occasion may stop to rest his feet, that&#039;s&nbsp; OK. But,young guys drinking, hanging out all day, sometimes&nbsp; at night, while your away or sleeping, is a recipe&nbsp; for criminal activity.

We were in each others&#039; basements, not out causing trouble. <br /><br />I&#039;d rather see ten homeless guys hanging out in my neighborhood than a group of drunk teenagers hanging out on every other corner.(Jesus, I&#039;m starting to sound like my grampa) From what I&#039;ve seen, homeless guys have at worst bothered me for change, but drunk meat head teens like to be &quot;tough guys&quot; and start fights.

				I just had to trim down my 8 paragraph rant about overly obese and uneducated people:<br />I can&#039;t stand them. I am not talking about large people for whom it&#039;s glandular, I&#039;m talking about the ones who can&#039;t put down their f*cking Big Mac for long enough to get up and make sure their legs don&#039;t atrophy and then collapse under the pressure of 450lbs of soon-to-be collecting disability gluttony. I also can&#039;t stand that they get Handicapped tags for their cars, it seems almost discouraging for them to lose weight- they should all get special permits that make them park as far away from their destination as possible so they can get some damn exercise. <br /><br />As for uneducated people: High school is free, if not almost free.

				What bothers me about this case specifically is that all this talk is based on one article, from one news &quot;source&quot; and there hasn&#039;t been an explosion of it all over the USA. You don&#039;t even know these people. so what that she has no high school diploma or GED. How do you know what her medical condition is. Yes, I know it said that she suffers from depression etc, but who are you( not just you billz but everyone else including para) to judge how they eat, how much they shop at the markets, and how often they eat it? I too am sick of the obesity problem in this country and freeloaders, but I&#039;m not so sure that this mother and daughter are freeloaders, just in a rut that is taking longer for them to get out of than they probably thought. And as for the not being able to make car payments, who said that they have a new car? Maybe they bought it used and are making payments on it? Jeez people, don&#039;t be so quick to judge from a effing article!! We <strong><em>are</em></strong> in a recession, in case you didn&#039;t notice.

				Quoting a movie to parallel real life?

If you&#039;re so against that sort of behavior, why don&#039;t you petition the mayor to have public housing and public assistance limited?

				Wow, I&#039;m gone for a few minutes and....<br />OK, so just to clarify, if I offended anyone with my comments about grossly obese people, let me re-iterate: I specifically said in my first post that it was not referring to people who are larger due to glandular or hereditary situations. If you are overeating to the point where it is physically preventing you from working, and you are collecting tax dollars because of it, there is an easy solution: STOP eating. I have<strong> nothing </strong>against obese people, I have something against people eating to the point where they are collecting welfare because they can&#039;t get up to go to work, and wasting my tax dollars on more food stamps to fund it. <br /><br />Secondly, I&#039;m pretty much with Billz 100% on this thread. Take some personal responsibility for what you do, don&#039;t waste my tax money, and the constitution is pretty clear on right to bear arms, though I would be in favor of an amendment being more specific.

The same system that provides disability for that Ohio family also provides for Cancer, MS, Dialysis and Arthritic patients, amputees, the sightless and the mentally challenged.

				I am <em>so</em> about to win the award for most quotes ever in a single thread.<br /><br />First of all, there&#039;s something about the NPR article that I would like to address. I&#039;m going to point out now, that I&#039;m coming in hard in defense of the daughter. I don&#039;t know what to say at this point about the mom, because there is <strong>no</strong> backround on her. All we know from the article, is that she had her daughter at 21, there is <strong>no</strong> mention of the girl&#039;s father, and she was in an accident at 23, which left her &#039;disabled&#039; and that she never finished high school. I don&#039;t think I believe that she&#039;s <em>never</em> worked. That seems impossible. I think it&#039;s highly probable that she did odd jobs or worked insignificant lengths of time at random jobs, but I could be totally wrong and she could be a lazy freeloader. The girl, on the other hand, is only 19. She must have graduated high school 1-2 years ago. The article specifically states she has had several jobs in recent years. The problem that everyone seems to have overlooked, is that their car broke down, and that is why the daughter is having trouble finding a job. It&#039;s not that she hasn&#039;t been looking, it&#039;s that she can&#039;t get anywhere without a car. I mean 40 miles outside of Toledo? How small of a town do you suppose this is? Look:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Hernandez received her high school diploma and has had several jobs in recent years. But now, because fewer restaurants and stores are hiring, she says she finds it hard to find a job. Even if she could, she says it&#039;s particularly hard to imagine how she&#039;ll keep it. She says she needs someone to give her a lift just to get to an interview. And with gas prices so high, she&#039;s not sure she could afford to pay someone to drive her to work every day.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Who wants to take bets on why she isn&#039;t going to college? I&#039;ll venture a guess that she can&#039;t live in Fostoria (How funny is that name) while attending college because the closest one is in Toledo and she has no way of getting there, because their car broke down. Even though she would probably get assloads of financial aide, it may not pay for her to live on campus, then what is the girl supposed to do? Loans? I&#039;m gonna bet that mommy&#039;s credit isn&#039;t all that great, which could pose a huge problem. Plus, think about the environment she&#039;s in, <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Nunez and most of her siblings and their spouses are unemployed and rely on government assistance and food stamps. ... Most of their extended family lives in the same townhouse complex. ... Nunez and her daughter are mostly stuck at home.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> Do you think her family is going to be super supportive for the girl? I&#039;m pointing all this crap out, because of comments like these:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Bonus points would have been given if you had mentioned the 19 year old daughter who doesn&#039;t work<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Uhm - that&#039;s the only one that isn&#039;t part of a larger context so I&#039;m just going to only leave that one.

The article doesn&#039;t specify the injury that prevents her from working. She could have had something gross and embarrassing involving her bladder happen to her, and that&#039;s why she can&#039;t work! We don&#039;t know, so you can&#039;t really say that! Her daughter, on the other hand, is only 19, she <em>has</em> been working, and has been looking for a job, but can&#039;t find one. It&#039;s not like she&#039;s not trying <em>at all</em>. And while it might be <em>possible</em> to buy a car cheaply without recurring payments, that doesn&#039;t mean that it&#039;s <em>feasible</em> for everyone at every time. I mean if the car broke down less than a year ago, and the daughter graduated high school max 2 years ago (therefore has no money), and during this time they&#039;re living off off $700/month where did you expect them to have saved enough to have $2gs squirreled away to buy a beater just in case?<br /><br />Next!<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=11202.msg142261#msg142261">Quote from: odenhal on July 24, 2008, 05:10:46 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">personal responsibility rules :rock:<br /><br />but 17 years on social security, c&#039;mon, and never worked ,c&#039;mmon<br />many of us i am sure who have worked and lived in NYC have had to go without icecream<br />lets not forget that they recieve medical benifits,probably housing benifits<br />and now her daughter is on the same road ,public assistance is NOT A BIRTHRIGHT<br /><br /><br />PS duska 3419...we love you just as you are baby,if anyone here offended your honor i will challenge them to a duel&nbsp; (man i&#039;ve been jonesing for a duel for like months)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>First, Odenhal, thank you for your kind words&nbsp; :-* Duels are awesome.

I understand that these things are difficult to overcome, but there is absolutely no excuse for sitting on yer ass for 20 years jobless because you&#039;re too overweight to work. It is not something that can&#039;t be remedied with a little sacrifice and hard work. <br />That&#039;s why unemployment insurance is one of the more effective social reform programs, because people have to prove they are doing something to remedy their situation- and it&#039;s temporary. Granted the job market is tough, but hey, so is life. Sitting on one&#039;s ass riding the welfare train is just plain inexcusable. A GED is not impossible to obtain, and readily available. I have to work 45+ hours a week at a job I&#039;d rather not be doing, but welcome to the real world. My inner liberal is trying to bitchslap me right now....

				But Frappe, can&#039;t the argument be made that your and other people&#039;s lifestyle choice, smoking, is also supported by tax dollars because not an insignificant sum of tax dollar monies are used to study and treat the ill health affects caused by your choice to smoke? <br /><br />I&#039;m not criticizing you for smoking, it&#039;s none of my concern, but it seems to me that people draw the line on what they think their tax dollars should and should not be spent on just outside the issues that affect them personally.<br />&nbsp;

				duska3419, I don&#039;t want to pull out my upbringing as a retort, but you asked me how I would feel as a young woman who is given the suggestion to get pregnant to solve financial problems. Guess what, I grew up pretty damn poor in rural PA and I heard that suggestion. I grew up around failing farms and closing factories.<br /><br />And I got out. I didn&#039;t get federal money for it (other than two $6,000 subsidized loans my college got for me) and I payed for a private four year institution by going around to private non-profits and applying for funds, writing speeches and essays, attending conferences, working like hell to get the money I needed. <br /><br />I don&#039;t expect everyone to be like me. But I do expect people to try to do something to improve their lives.<br /><br />If the government is going to feed, clothe and house you, the least you can do is try to find a way to make the changes so that eventually the government can stop. Why can&#039;t the daughter take online college courses? What are they doing to make their lives better?

Perhaps those who think it a shame to be supported by their government should try to live on what is gotten and see if they could survive on it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Your comments cut me pretty deep. &nbsp;I mean that in a heartfelt and sincere way. &nbsp;We seldom agree on this board, but you are a regular here, as am I, and I respect you. &nbsp;I respect all of you, in fact. &nbsp;I like you guys, and I hope you like me. &nbsp;Although I know I probably leave you shaking your heads half the time. &nbsp;<br /><br />Those who know me, know that pompous is not what I am about. &nbsp;I may disagree with 90 percent of the people on this board, but I&#039;m a pretty nice, down to earth guy. &nbsp;Or at least, I hope that I am. &nbsp;I see now while re-reading my posts, that although I believe 100 percent in what I said, my word choice was poor in a few cases. &nbsp;I sometimes get defensive, because after all, it is me against the world on this board.<br /><br />Shame was a poor word choice. &nbsp;I did not mean that anyone should feel ashamed for needing some help up. &nbsp;I know that there will always be people in need of help, and that those people outweigh the &quot;freeloaders.&quot; &nbsp;I would never imply that someone who has fallen on hard times should feel shame. &nbsp;What I meant to convey, and perhaps I did so poorly, is that the goal of those on benefits should be, if at all possible, to get off of them as quickly as possible. &nbsp;Thank you for putting me in place, as I probably deserved it. &nbsp;I hope you didn&#039;t mean the pompous thing too strongly.<br /><br />Duska&#039;s posting was really well thought out, and I don&#039;t know if I have the time to address it in full, and I can&#039;t figure out how to quote it without making a mess of this posting, but there are some points I want to address. &nbsp;Excise the &quot;But still...&quot; from my posting, because in this case, it was not throwing up my hands because I couldn&#039;t make a point to save my life. &nbsp;It was throwing up my hands as a rhetorical flourish to take a shot at NPR. &nbsp;I think it&#039;s a joke that the NPR couldn&#039;t do any better to make the activist point that they were trying to make, but no one here would claim they are not a credible news source.<br /><br />As far as the Fight Club quote, I get the context of the original line in the movie. &nbsp;I wasn&#039;t attempting to use the quote in the same context here, and I wasn&#039;t offering it as a serious defense of my point. &nbsp;I just thought it was fun in the context of this board, because it was a menacing quote about a group of people growing in strength and flexing their collective muscle. &nbsp;You&#039;re surprised I like Fight Club? &nbsp;I&#039;m a 26 year old guy. &nbsp;I don&#039;t necessarily agree with the social message of Fight Club, but it&#039;s damn fun to watch. &nbsp;They don&#039;t make you hand in your movie watcher rights when you become a square like me. &nbsp;:-)<br /><br />As far as the group of people around the Broadway station, I have mentioned them a few times before in other threads. &nbsp;There is a group of people, about three men and one woman, who are always hanging around the Broadway station or the municipal parking lot in the area. &nbsp;I have seen them urinate in public in front of children on multiple occasions, they run a low level extortion scam &quot;helping people park&quot; in the municipal lot, and last week, I saw the woman, obviously high on meth, threaten to cut the throat of a 6 year old child with a family who was leaving the station. &nbsp;I feel like that&#039;s the sort of topic we should address in this thread.<br /><br />Duska, your latest is by far the most thoughtful posting in this thread and you make some excellent points about mobility and psychology. &nbsp;I still cling to the belief that there are cases where benefits can be cut, and I still suspect that this might be one of those cases. &nbsp;But you&#039;re right, I don&#039;t know for sure and it&#039;s unfair to suggest otherwise.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=11202.msg142384#msg142384">Quote from: 28Grand on July 25, 2008, 08:19:25 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Do you know what I hate?<br />Judgmental people who feel they have the right to criticize and pick on other people for sport and make comments on their lives in order to make themselves feel better about their own and reassure themselves that they are superior.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I don&#039;t go in for that sort of thing either. &nbsp;Do you really think that&#039;s what going on here?

				28Grand, this is certainly not a case of drawing the line of .....&nbsp; More then half of the retail price of a pack of cigarettes is made up of &quot;sin taxes&quot;, wherein they are taxes which are above and beyond what the normal sales tax on a product is.&nbsp; I admittidly have no idea of the economics involved, but it seems to me that alot of taxes would be collected over the course of a lifetime.&nbsp; It certainly covers much, much more of the costs then the tax collected on McDonald&#039;s big macs, ben &amp; jerry ice cream and igloo waffle fries towards obesity related problems (between zero and nothing).&nbsp; So if we are going to play the fair is fair game, cigarette smokers got junk food eaters beaten dead to rights.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now, the &quot;sin tax&quot; money of course does not goto where it is supposed to go.&nbsp; Instead, it is used as a simple cash raising feature for local governments.&nbsp; I wholeheartedly disagree with the concept of the sin tax, as it is the government trying to regulate my morals though the pocketbook.&nbsp; I&#039;d rather go Billyz&#039;s route and have no taxes and no social safety net.

I find it sad for them and for society, lesser so because it’s a crime against the taxpayer because if concern for the taxpayer were at the root of it where is the intensity of outrage when rich people, who have the means, put their hand in the government pot and take their share? Where are the personal attacks on the rich when they commit financial fraud that puts the national economy at risk and requires the U.S. taxpayer to bail out their companies?<br /><br />No, the focus is on the poorer and the uneducated because we make assumptions and judge them by our own experiences.

				Billz, I guess my lack of testosterone made me forget the fun of watching men beat each other up and do crazy s___ and f___ crazy chicks. When I think of Fight Club I guess I forget the face value of it. My bad, dude! <br />I actually agree with Frappe, in a way. I think it&#039;s unfair that smokers have to pay these insane taxes. However, I don&#039;t think ice cream ought to have a &#039;sin tax&#039;, I think there ought to be no &#039;sin taxes&#039; and less coruption and red tape in government to that the taxes are actually used to benefit all people who actually need it, and pay cops and fighter fighters and public servants more, etc. etc. But, ya know, in a perfect world.....<br />Maybe Para is right too. Maybe these people need someone to go give them a good kick in ass to get them started.<br />I don&#039;t know.

If society is going to support you, it ought to be temporary (except in cases of severe disability--with the internet, people can work and help support the programs they rely upon from their own homes) and it ought to come with requirements that you get the skills and information that can keep you from needing the programs.

				28 Grand, I noticed you quoted me a couple of posts back, but then did not address it, instead it seemed rolled together with the chord comment. &nbsp;Did you forget to include a note? &nbsp;It still comes down to it that I am paying for my cigatettes <span class="bbc_u">and</span> the big macs.<br /><br />As for the social safety net, I thought it was pretty clear I was referring to not having the safety net when it comes to lifestyle choices. &nbsp;Every post I made concerned such. &nbsp;To clear things up, I do prefer the safety net in other instances. &nbsp;That being said, it needs to be a system which is designed, if possible, to get them off of the net as soon as reasonable possible, rather than allowing to linger for years on end.<br /><br />And as much as I hate my tax money going to support low income loafers, I hate it even more when it goes to support the high income loafers. &nbsp;And I dislike the justice system which supports it. &nbsp;I go out and steal a $30,000 car, how long am I in prison for? &nbsp;How long did Marty Steward get for her heist? &nbsp;Bet mine would be longer. &nbsp;

				28Grand--<br /><br />That&#039;s an interesting discussion that I just don&#039;t know as much about and would have to do more research on. <br /><br />I think it&#039;s a little out of left field, though, to criticize us for an issue completely separate from the one at hand. If you&#039;d like to get into a conversation about that, I&#039;d be up for it, but it&#039;s wrong to assume that my position regarding the people in the NPR article dictates my position on corporate tax breaks or anything else.

				Bill -- you&#039;ve mentioned good outcomes for some government subsidies and that&#039;s what I meant by some I agree with and some I don&#039;t. But welfare is just another word for subsidy and the argument can be made that a university, with a billion dollar endowment and highly paid management team, could afford to fund their own research -- ditto for a pharmaceutical company -- especially when that tax seed money earns those organizations patents and hefty profits.<br /><br />In regard to social benefits I&#039;d rather someone work than pay them welfare and I think it&#039;s best to encourage and conjole people to find ways to earn a living but I also rather pay them welfare than have to step over them while walking to work every day, especially when our tax monies also provide a very good living for many people who have means without that tax money.<br /><br />Para -- I wasn&#039;t assuming anything about you or your opinion personally and I&#039;m sorry if it appeared that way but I think you understand that I why I reacted as I did.<br /><br />Here&#039;s where I&#039;m coming from: there seems to be something stirring in that I read more and more articles where the opinion rages about not paying for people&#039;s lifestyle choices, mainly when it comes to healthcare, but it&#039;s creeping into other areas and it has me worried. We won&#039;t pay for health problems of the smokers, the fatties, the drinkers...where does this go? That&#039;s what I mean that we draw these lines just beyond our doorsteps. Who will be next? Do we only care for people who are deemed worthy and throw the rest on the scrap heap? That happens too much already.<br /><br />Consider this: what about people who engage in rough sports? Do we not treat them when they break an arm or a leg beacuse it was their choice to play that sport? Unlikely, yes but you can&#039;t say that will never happen. Maybe it&#039;s me but I don&#039;t believe in never. &nbsp;

Last summer my husband got hurt playing football. He ended up being out of work for 6 months and having to have surgery to repair his torn ligaments in his shoulder. I fortunately have a stable job &amp; health benefits which is more than a lot of people in this country have. However because my husband was unable to work and my job was unable to cover all our bills it was necessary for him to collect disability in order to keep up with bills and not fall into debt. We were fortunate that he was not permanently injured and eventually able to go back to work- which believe me he did the second he got the ok from the doctor. <br /><br />My point being is accidents do happen. I hope you never end up having an accident- because trust me it is pretty scary not knowing how you are going to pay your mounting medical bills, rent, etc. It is much more complex than saying &quot;pay your own damn bill&quot;. <br /><br /><br />

Last summer my husband got hurt playing football. He ended up being out of work for 6 months and having to have surgery to repair his torn ligaments in his shoulder. I fortunately have a stable job &amp; health benefits which is more than a lot of people in this country have. However because my husband was unable to work and my job was unable to cover all our bills it was necessary for him to collect disability in order to keep up with bills and not fall into debt. We were fortunate that he was not permanently injured and eventually able to go back to work- which believe me he did the second he got the ok from the doctor. <br /><br />My point being is accidents do happen. I hope you never end up having an accident- because trust me it is pretty scary not knowing how you are going to pay your mounting medical bills, rent, etc. It is much more complex than saying &quot;pay your own damn bill&quot;. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It is more complex than that, but part of the reason you got what you got is that you and your husband were both working prior to the accident. I have no problem with helping out people when they hit hard times, provided that these are &quot;hard times&quot; and not the way they live perpetually.<br /><br />When my father was injured, he was in the ICU for a week and then in rehabilitation after that. My parents don&#039;t have what most people call insurance, they only have what insurance actually is--stuff for serious injuries. It didn&#039;t cover anything and he couldn&#039;t work. I left college to take care of the family business. I don&#039;t even know if they offer disability for farmers, but my parents didn&#039;t get any money then.<br /><br />I&#039;m not saying it would have been wrong for them to take assistance had it been available, but I am saying that there are lots of ways to work situations out if you&#039;re hard working and determined. I don&#039;t mind helping out the working people who are struggling. I do mind having systems that allow people to perpetually not work, not pursue their own methods of sustenance and rely on the working citizenry to support them for their entire lives.

It is important to have some kind of fallback when people hit hard times, it will inevitably happen to most people. I am all for that.<br />When people live on 20 years of government support without having to work, that is just ridiculous. I know the obese thing is just kind of the topper, but I&#039;ll say it again: If you&#039;re that strapped financially, then it is unreasonable for you to be grossly overweight, especially on our tax bill.
