				Random barroom conversation that developed over whiskey and cigarettes:<br /><br />A friend stated that the guidelines for buying an engagement ring is three months of one&#39;s salary.&nbsp; I would have sworn that they used to say two months, but then a couple of others chimed in, agreeing with the three months thing.<br /><br />What&#39;s the word on this one?&nbsp; 10 to 20G&#39;s seems like way too much for regular folk to spend old dinosaur bones, though maybe this is skewered because we live in New York?<br /><br />

				While I love my ring (thank you husband), I actually think I would have been equally as happy with something that was more sentimental and less expensive - like doing a ring with his birthstone or both of ours. That would have saved some money for sure.<br /><br />I think it is ridiculous to set an arbitrary guideline or number on how much you should spend. That&#39;s like setting a price on love and your relationship. I&#39;ll lump the cost of the wedding and all that jazz in there as well. Doesn&#39;t matter how much or how little you spend (although I&#39;m all for thrifty) - what matters is your relationship and if you are equal partners. The rest is just a materialistic and superficial representation of that. That&#39;s just my $0.01 (I&#39;m thrifty, remember? :)).

				Right, and the fact that the price of the ring you &quot;should&quot; buy is magically calibrated to the price of *your* salaray (vs. a high-qality stone is going to cost at least $X) seems to indicate that the &quot;formula&quot; is designed to fleece as many people as possible at all income levels.<br /><br />There are very many lovely rings on which the major stone is not a diamond that are not very expensive at all.

				Don&#39;t forget, the type of metal also contributes to the cost of the ring.&nbsp; My engagement and wedding bands are yellow gold, but my husband&#39;s wedding band which we had made in platinum cost nearly the same as both of my rings, even sans diamond.&nbsp; Just get something nice (you have to look at the ring forever after all), and don&#39;t worry about the &quot;formula.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)&nbsp;

				Allowing De Beers to let you know how much you should spend to show your love and devotion is just as silly as allowing Hallmark to do so. While I have hear the two-months range as well, I&#39;ve seen much more beautiful symbols of engagement from antique shops, much like enigma cat stated....<br /><br />but then I would also argue the the engagement ring in general is unnecessary. <br /><br />Enlighten us Frappe, are congrats in order?&nbsp; :wink:

I believe that my daughter-in-law will be able to do the same should they ever desire to do so. Frankly, I prefer sapphire to diamond.

It legally belongs to the wife no matter who ends the marriage.

I am of the generation that still believes that a tiger never changes his stripes.

				I think many women have a &quot;zipper problem&quot; as well - just not talked about as much, I suppose. In that case if the man buys an engagement ring perhaps he should be a bit more frugal if he doesn&#39;t trust her enough to be faithful in marriage.

An included stone of any type is not a good investment. A practically perfect stone, with a perfect table, with flawless facets, set in a better quality metal, can be a great investment. When you go to buy a diamond, you *need* to know what makes a good stone; you need to have a relationship with your gem dealer; you need to have at least 2 independent appraisals from accredited gem labs that value the stone at least 3 times what you will be paying for it—that is a very good investment quality stone. There are 2 sides to the Blood Diamond argument. I fully understand the one that says diamonds only devalue. That stems from the activists who would rather not see any diamonds mined. The other side of that argument is history itself. People who make an investment in a quality diamond understand that you *never* buy a stone from a jeweler; you buy from a gem dealer. And you *never* sell a stone to a jeweler or a gem dealer, you sell it to either a buyer or at an auction where quality estate jewelry is being sold. <br /><br />If you bought a fine quality 2 carat stone in 1976 for $2,500—unset—and then spent an additional $1,500 on the casting, that ring today would probable fetch $35,000–$40,000. Remember you haven&#39;t been paying taxes on it like an ordinary investment. A diamond is not a short-term investment by any means. <br /><br />I personally, have very mixed feelings on the subject, but I do understand both side of the argument.

				Eh, my points didn&#39;t need to be appreciated anyway. <br /><br />http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/198202/diamond/4<br /><br />This is the article I was talking about - the link should go directly to the page that describes the UK magazine &quot;Money Which&quot; buying diamonds and attempting to sell them at profit. It&#39;s very interesting. <br /><br />That said, this was published 15 years ago and for all I know the diamond industry may have changed since then, or the journalists in question may not have known how to buy and sell good diamonds. I certainly don&#39;t know as much about this as NYCMacUser does, but I personally would not be comfortable buying them or having them bought for me - whether as an investment or a &quot;symbol of love.&quot; If anyone cares to test my resolve, you are welcome to show up at my door with jewelry for me to try on. :) Bring a sapphire or two for a control group!<br /><br />mcw, I definitely think you have a point about men having a certain investment in &quot;showing off&quot; by buying their gals a nice diamond. I&#39;m sure everyone agrees on that. If men truly didn&#39;t want to buy them, I don&#39;t think they would.
