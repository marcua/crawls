				Where oh where does one find a proper pint of Guinness? Not too cold, a thick head and goes down like a glass of milk?&nbsp; <br /><br />Not one to be negative on the Rover because that place has always been the salvation of the neighborhood. Great prices, awesome pour of Guinness and nice atmosphere.&nbsp; But yesterday was the second time that the pint was way too cold, a bit rough and didn&#039;t go down so smooth.&nbsp; <br /><br />Dillingers: Goes down smooth as can be but a bit too cold and not as cheap as the Rover.&nbsp; Lately though it&#039;s been a better pint that the Rover.<br /><br />Blackbirds: Too cold and too much money.&nbsp; Plus the annoying Houlihan&#039;s type waiter with lots of flair.<br /><br />Come on folks, where does one find the best Guinness in Astoria?

				what about the Quays / Pulpit?&nbsp; I usually get Smithwick&#039;s there, but people who like Guiness have told me they pour a fine pint.

				We tend to go to Cronin and Phelan for our Guinness....i think in most places around nyc it is just a touch too cold. I always have them bring the next one when I am halfway done with the current pint just to let it warm just a bit. <br /><br />The best Guinness I have had on the East Coast was oddly enough at Fado in downtown DC.

				I&#039;m a fan of McCaffrey &amp; Burke (30th Ave and 31st Street, right next to the 30th Ave station). The atmosphere is awesomely neighborhood bar and the main bartender pours an authentically Irish pint. <br /><br />In the city, I love Molly&#039;s (23rd &amp; 3rd) in Gramercy. Not only do they have the BEST burgers around, it&#039;s easily the best pint in all of NYC. I ADORE this place. <br /><br />Just make sure you don&#039;t ruin them by telling everybody you know (like, say, by posting on a message board about them&nbsp; :wink:)

				Cronin &amp; Phelan, McCaffrey &amp; Burke, and The Quays, totally! Astoria was never too heavily Irish from what I can tell, but was Irish enough to have enough places that know how to pull a pint.
