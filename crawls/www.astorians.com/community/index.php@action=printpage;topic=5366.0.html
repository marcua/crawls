				I looked for Marjana the other day and couldn&#039;t find it!&nbsp; What a bummer that it closed - I heard it was pretty good.&nbsp; Guess not good enough...<br /><br />Walima, a new Morroccan restaurant has opened up (31st Ave? Broadway?) in the mid-40s, and might be a good option.&nbsp; <br /><br />On preview:&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard good things about Stove.&nbsp; Went by there and peeked in the window and it looked kinda small, though.<br /><br />There is a place in LIC called La Vuelta (http://www.lavueltabistro.com/), which could be fun.

				Well, cheap is certainly not a bad thing, what with money being scarce around my apartment and all that (order more cakes and stuff, people!!).&nbsp; Mostly I was intrigued by the hot waiter factor.&nbsp; &nbsp;:wink:<br /><br />I&#039;ve been wanting to try Stove.&nbsp; I think that would be my vote.&nbsp; Of course, Moroccan sounds good, too.&nbsp; It&#039;s too hard!!!

				Stove is owned by a chef who is the brother of the owner of Irish rover.&nbsp; So at least you know they will have a good pour of Guinness. Food was pretty good too.&nbsp; May be a bit too small for a large group.<br /><br />I volunteer to speak with Ovelia if people want to have the next EATS there.

				hi y&#039;all. Adam and I have been to Walima 3x times now and the portions are enormous, it&#039;s the kind of place that if people are willing to do family style, we can order several things for the table and share. They&#039;re very eager to please and I think would be able to accomodate a group of us with some advance time. I or Adam would be happy to negotiate/reserve/etc.... They&#039;ve only been open for 2 months and by the way, their hummus is really good. This opinion comes from two hummus lovers. Leaving Walima aside for now, though (maybe another month?) I vote for Stove or Ovelia (if Ovelia can offer a reasonable pre-fixe) Having never been there, do people who&#039;ve eaten there feel like the price is justified by the quality/creativity in the food for a greek place in astoria? If a brunch is on, have been to Brick-great, but would like to try a new place like Dillinger&#039;s.

				o.k. some of the offerings at Walima are: Harira (spicy tomato, lentil soup) Chicken Briwat (phyllo pastry with lemon chicken) Shwarma and Kebob sandwiches, Tajines, Bastillas, Couscous (with only vegetables option) and the typical Moroccan appetizers like Hummus, Tabouleh, Babaghanoush, and their version or Raita.

				Right now I&#039;m more interested in Ovelia than Walima for the EATS dinner, primarily because the flavours of Greek food are sounding more appetising, and I&#039;ve heard other good things about it.&nbsp; Don&#039;t get me wrong - I love Moroccan food, too, and would really like to try Walima at some point - I guess I&#039;m just with gfb right now.

				Some more information about Walima if we go there for March: $20 pre-fix not including tax and tip would include per person soda/juice, one appetizer, one entree and a small side salad. The entree would be some sort of chicken or lamb dish and a vegetarian option like couscous. No alcochol is allowed in the establishment since they are practicing Muslams. I&#039;ll have to set something up with them a week before our date and they&#039;ll be able to accomodate a group of 15-20+ on a weeknight. What&#039;s the good word on Ovelia, do we have a similair option there or a-la carte?
