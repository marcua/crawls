				Very interesting article!&nbsp; I&#039;d think that while men and women would not admit that such affects them, it most likely does, atleast on an unconcious level.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;d also like to see a paper to study the non-visual cues.&nbsp; We see an inordinate amount of nice cars and houses along with actors/actresses with glamorous, professional jobs on the television.&nbsp; We also see them with extremely full social lives, engaging in activities which are by far more interesting and frequent than most normal folks get to do.&nbsp; How much of that also affects the way people look at their mates?<br /><br />

				I wonder how true this holds for the opposite sex. Ladies, any input?<br />I do think it is kind of an unfair double standard, though, because many guys with non-classically handsome features or who are older can still be considered sex symbols, at least more so than females. <br /><br />

				Well, the stereotype (which I think has grounding in the truth) is that women are more interested in power and men in beauty. I think that&#039;s why men can get away with not looking like a 10 and still being able to score one.

				I think that if you are incapable of being attracted to a less than &quot;perfect&quot; person just because you work in an environment that constantly surrounds you with beautiful people, then you need to spend some time in therapy.<br /><br />On a somewhat similar note, this is like allowing your daughter to only play with Barbie dolls because she should be like Barbie, the perfect girl, and find a guy like Ken, the perfect guy.&nbsp; Nice way to develop self-esteem issues in a child.&nbsp; I think the article is just a grown up version of the same thing.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				Actually, just let the average guys date some hot women for a while. They&#039;ll quickly learn what a PITA that can be. Just as dating a hot, rich guy would be.<br />Why would I want to date a guy that every woman I run into would fawn over?!

Unfortunate but true.&nbsp; <br /><br />There was a study written up somewhere (can&#039;t remember where) about &quot;Why older males are attracted to young women&quot;. Besides all the jokes and assumptions the scientist wrote about us all being animals and animals work by instinct. Young women will always be attractive because they are the ones who can produce offspring. And male animals will always act towards survival and reproduction.&nbsp; &nbsp; Since this is true everywhere it is not just human emotional and society traits but nature.&nbsp; Essentially males of all species think with their penis for a reason (Insert joke, insult, slam on men here).&nbsp; We know this is true and you hear that same line a million times about guys of all ages, class, etc...<br /><br />I do like to think at along the way most men smarten up and realize that women are more than curves and looks.&nbsp; Sex is awesome but having nothing to talk about in the morning kinda sucks. Might as well just stick with prostitutes and one night stands.&nbsp; That and marriage without relationship and friendship would never really work out. Maybe the best advise is do not give up on men. The good ones are out there, just stay in the game.

				<em>this is the environment we&#039;ve created for ourselves.</em><br /><br />Indeed, it&#039;s all about commercialism: Magazines are full of unattainable good looks, and the ads next to the pictures of the impossibly thin models and their clothes sell products that promise to make you look like that. <br /><br />Men are conditioned to find the impossibly good-looking women attractive, so that women are now scrambling to attain those same looks. What do we need to buy to become appealing to men? What will make me look younger/skinnier? <br /><br />It&#039;s not necessarily nature. Only 100 years ago or so, weren&#039;t *fat* women considered sexy? That&#039;s because back then, fat = wealthy and healthy.

				You don&#039;t have to go back at all, just over. <br /><br />I read an article a few years ago about an African country in which it&#039;s considered sexy for women to be fat - but instead of being relaxed and accepting towards women&#039;s bodies, what it comes down to is girls being force-fed so that they can be attractive enough to get married. I&#039;ll try to hunt down that link. <br /><br />ETA:<br />This isn&#039;t the same article I was talking about, but similar idea: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/3291271.stm

				Hrm. I thought the 8 was adjusted for the change in sizes. Guess I remembered incorrectly. Still, though, wasn&#039;t Monroe also about 5&#039;1&quot; or 5&#039;2&quot;? 117 for those kinds of heights is still pretty &quot;thick&quot; by today&#039;s model/fashionista/whathaveyou standards.

				I&#039;d have to agree that the more beautiful people there are the less attracted people are to average looking men and women. I used to live in Miami and when I moved to NY at 22, I remember thinking &quot;Jesus! Where are all the hot girls???&quot; A couple of years later, I walked through the street and said to myself, &quot;OK, this is great! The hot girls are moving to New York&quot;. The &quot;hot&quot; girls were always there but in Miami, you get used to Swimsuit Issue looking women...same haircuts, same bra size, same waist, same everything...not very unique but they are definitely gorgeous. Latin women from all around South, Central America and the Caribbean. Their beauty is undeniable.<br /><br />I want to add that the women in New York have the best personalities. They are uniquely fierce, independent, strong and sexy as hell. They come from all over the world, speaking different languages. They read vociferously, they write, they paint, they lead businesses...and if all this sounds pretty status quo then you&#039;re in luck. I don&#039;t know about you but I&#039;d rather date a New York transplant than a hot Miami girl who thinks that (to quote from an ad I&#039;ve seen all over the city) &quot;superdelegate&quot; is a setting for a dryer any day of the week. Absolutely. No doubt about it.
