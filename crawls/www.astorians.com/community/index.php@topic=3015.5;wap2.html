			I&#39;m sorry, but none of you know what you&#39;re talking about. SOAP will be the best film in the history of cinema.

			This movie was made as a joke.&nbsp; The producers never meant for it to be taken seriously.&nbsp; You should check out some of the interviews with Sam Jackson about it.&nbsp; I think it&#39;s almost like they were proving a point...<br /><br />&quot;Let&#39;s come up with the stupidest premise for a movie EVER.&nbsp; I&#39;m sure someone will bankroll it for us.&nbsp; And the amazing thing is that people are stupid enough to go see it!&quot;
