				We went to Las Margaritas (38th &amp; Broadway) last night for dinner. BIG MISTAKE.&nbsp; We had been there once before ages ago and couldn&#039;t remember why we didn&#039;t go back.&nbsp; I thought, &quot;maybe they have a new chef - it&#039;s always so busy&quot;.<br /><br />It was full of drunk people who were all celebrating their birthday - and they play a very loud mariachi rendition of &quot;happy birthday&quot; and bring out a piece of cake and make a big deal.&nbsp; I guess it&#039;s a tribute to chain restaurants.&nbsp; Plus,there only play like 4 or 5 songs in their mix - and repeat the Gypsy King&#039;s &quot;Bamboleo&quot; frequently.<br /><br />But I really wanted to write about the food:&nbsp; VILE.&nbsp; I ordered a combination platter of a tamal, sope, and enchilada.&nbsp; She asked cheese, chicken, beef, or mixed.&nbsp; I chose mixed.&nbsp; I tasted the tamal first and it was super sweet (?!) and really really really glutinous.&nbsp; I felt like I had taken a bite of congealed wallpaper paste.&nbsp; I spit it out into my napkin - I simply couldn&#039;t swallow it.&nbsp; Then I ate the sope - which was ok.&nbsp; Nothing to write home about but it wasn&#039;t nauseating either.&nbsp; Then I tasted the enchilada which was *allegedly* covered in some sort of mole sauce.&nbsp; One bite and it brought me back to my childhood when we had a dog that we fed milkbone dog biscuits.&nbsp; That&#039;s EXACTLY what it tasted like - a dog biscuit.&nbsp; I spit that out into my napkin, too.<br /><br />The waitress was walking by and asked if everything was alright and I said no, that the food was inedible, that I couldn&#039;t eat another thing.&nbsp; She was very nice, offered the menu to me which i refused (nicely).&nbsp; She didn&#039;t charge us.&nbsp; I spent the rest of the night with a quivering stomach - whether out of some sort of microbe that I might have ingested at that crap hole or (more likely) pure revulsion, I don&#039;t know.<br /><br />How does this place stay in business?&nbsp; That was BAR NONE the WORST restaurant in Astoria we have ever been - quite possibly the worst restaurant in the world.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />To be fair the chips and salsa were good and as i&nbsp; mentioned the waitress was very nice.

				I went in once about 3 summers ago and walked right out. The stench of ammonia and/or bleach was overwhelming. I really don&#039;t know how people were able to eat with that smell. I went in another time to give it a second chance (well, first really since I didn&#039;t eat the first time) and I wasn&#039;t really impressed. I didn&#039;t find the food to be very fresh and would have much preferred Tacos Mexico which is catty-corner to Las Margaritas.&nbsp;

				Well, clearly you all don&#039;t get it.&nbsp; I agree, the food at Las Margaritas is nothing to write home about (for how good or bad it is).&nbsp; But who goes there for the food?&nbsp; Its all about the margarita happy hour my friends.&nbsp; Las Margaritas has, SURPRISE!, a very nice happy hour that lasts all weekend.&nbsp; And their chips and salsa, which was appropriately praised, is all you need to eat when drinking happy hour margaritas.&nbsp; If you want good mexican food then you should go somewhere else.&nbsp; If you want a nice staff (they are really kind), good chips and salsa and a cheap margarita buzz, then you could do a lot worse.

				I&#039;ve been there for the happy hour and even the margaritas were terrible.&nbsp; Watered down and burny going down.&nbsp; &nbsp;I agree with the OP and all the P&#039;s after.&nbsp; There are so many other better Mexican alternatives near there.

				I worked as a bartender for 5 years, and I know exactly what cheap sour mix tastes like: The drinks at Las Margaritas. I used to get dragged there by my wife for the 2for1 happy hour, but then I found Creek (off the 7) and that&#039;s our new hangout. Really good mexican food, awesome happy hour deal (two for one, and they are in pint glasses, pint glasses I say)!

				I&#039;ve always thought their drinks were decent, never been that impressed with the food.&nbsp; I don&#039;t go there anymore, but the staff were always friendly and attentive.&nbsp; It&#039;s a nicely designed space, though better when they had the back area before the building next door was built.

				randall129,<br /><br />The margaritas at the Creek and the Cave were good?&nbsp; I usually grab some beers there, but never imagined their mixed drinks would be any good.&nbsp; Did you get a frozen or regular margarita?<br /><br />

				The margaritas at Creek/Cave aren&#039;t &quot;good&quot; -- but they blow the margaritas at Las Margaritas out of the water. I don&#039;t think they even make blended margaritas. I recollect the drinks being rather strong, so you could taste the tequilla instead of being overwhelmed by sour mix. For the money, you get twice as much as you do at Las Margs, and the drinks are better. <br /><br />Just consider the quality of food at Creek v. Las MArgs, and the drinks are pretty much on par.<br /><br />For a good margarita (not in astoria) Canyon Road on the UES (77th and 1st, I think) uses fresh sour. Mojave&#039;s have been hit and miss depending on the bartender. For the record -- I prefer a stripped down margarita: 2 oz tequilla, 1 oz fresh lime, 1/2 oz agave, shaken and strained into a martini glass. The shaking waters it down just enough.

				Never having tried Las Margaritas, I take your word that your experience was the WORST food experience in Astoria EVER, but as far as &quot;maybe the world,&quot; I can&#039;t help but suspect that it was marginally better than the experience of the Donner Party.

				I remember going to Las Margaritas a couple months after I moved to Astoria summer of &#039;05.&nbsp; I thought it was pretty terrible.&nbsp; When my girlfriend moved here last year she kept passing by it and being we like Mexican food asked about it.&nbsp; Since it had been a few years, I was willing to give it a second try.&nbsp; No improvement, we aren&#039;t going back ever again.<br /><br />Does anyone remember when they briefly changed their name to Margaritaville?&nbsp; I have a feeling Jimmy Buffett and whoever owns his chain of restaurants threatened a lawsuit so they changed it back.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t tried Tacos Mexico yet, it looked kind of sketchy to me.&nbsp; But being I have yet to find good Mexican in Astoria (I wasn&#039;t overly impressed with Guacamole) I may have to check it out.

				If it&#039;s restaurant on corner, I had bad experience there, besides awful food, which I was taking out, they hit me with a tax on bill that was somthing like 30%.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I argued with them, but only one girl spoke a little English, and it got to where they were going to call police, so I paid,never went back.

				I agree- I&#039;ve given the place a several chances, and all were terrible, both in terms of food and service. Tacos Mexicos across the street has much better food and their dining room isn&#039;t too bad. Drinks are made at the bar next door.
