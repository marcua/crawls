				For selfish financial and altruistic environmental reasons (mostly selfish financial) I took a vow to not buy anything new this month other than food and health/safety items. It&#39;s going pretty well and I think I will try to do it for the rest of the year. <br /><br />I&#39;m looking to track down the following items for barter or resale. <br />- alarm clock<br />- gym bag or backpack<br /><br /><br />

				I could do something food-related (fresh home-made bread, apricot/cardamom tart, a week&#39;s worth of frozen lunches). <br /><br />I have a brand-new humidifier that I tried using once but actually made me cough more. <br /><br />I am not against paying cash, either. As long as I&#39;m not buying it new it&#39;s ok :)

				I have a ton of stuff I&#39;d be willing to swap for the right trade! I have a homedics-style vibrating massage pad (not a chair, just a pad that you drape over a chair) that I&#39;ve used all of twice... would be willing to trade if someone made me a deal...

You might be able to list them (Craigslist, eBay, etc.) and make a few well-earned bucks. Pull the trunk over to the computer, list them in Excel, and hit the alphabetize button. IMHO, no-one is going to take them *all* off your hands because they don&#39;t know what they&#39;re getting. I did the same thing a few years ago with vinyl records that I inherited from my parents and my sister. I combined the collections, cataloged them, and sold the lot to a dealer. I made enough off that sale to buy a car in 2001. Think about it.

				Well, my interests - for both the movies and the audio books - are sci fi, classics, foreign, anything related to religion or spirituality. British comedies and murder mysteries are good. <br /><br />what if you we have a REAL swap meet and you bring those trunks so we can look through them? :D <br /><br />My inner librarian might be bribed to help with cataloging, should you decide to take NYCMacUser&#39;s advice. It probably really is the most efficient way for you to unload them. And, um, I really like going through stacks of books/etc. And cataloging!!!!

				I&#39;ve only begun to use LibraryThing.&nbsp; It&#39;s kind of neat.&nbsp; A guy I know in CA uses it and inspired me to check it out.&nbsp; When I have more time I&#39;ll put more books in it.

				I am looking for one bed riser. I realize it is odd that I only need one, but what I need it for is even odder. We have a standup shower and high ceilings. We bought one of those floor to ceiling organizers for shampoo, etc and it is about 3 inches too short. So my brilliant idea was to use a bed riser so it will work. If anyone has any other suggestions, I am open.<br /><br />For this or any other offer I have the following:<br /><br />*numerous duffle bags - some quite large, although they probably have the logo of a sports league on them. Many of them are quite nice and used by athletes. There are only so many bags a person needs though.<br /><br />*homemade meatloaf made with either turkey meat or ground beef (have been told my turkey meatloaf is amazing)<br /><br />*homemade chocolate chip cookies or peanut butter kiss cookies (you know, the ones with the hershey kisses on top)<br /><br />
