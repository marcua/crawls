				I couldn&#039;t believe it when I saw that strange guy in the NYT article.&nbsp; He used to sing and dance in front of the Chase bank building right off the Ditmars station.&nbsp; He&#039;s gotten quieter recently and sits on chair with a sign.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen him every time I go into the Ditmars station area.&nbsp; I must admit that I kind of felt excited seeing him in the article.&nbsp; &nbsp;:lol:&nbsp; Now he&#039;s a local celebrity.&nbsp; Wonder how his life&#039;s going to change from the exposure.

				Ok, forgive me but &#039;local celebrity&#039;...come on :-o<br /><br />Is he honestly the face of the end of the line that you want portrayed for the part of this city that you call home??<br /><br />I&#039;m sure we could have come up with some better options to feature at the end of the N line

				I haven&#039;t been here that long (only about 6 months) but I have never heard that guy say anything remotely coherent. Just humming and playing with his hands. <br /><br />I did think that when I move I was going to miss seeing him. I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll get my own resident weird dude at my new stop. Hopefully he&#039;s as innocuous as Mr. Happel. <br /><br />And better to feature him than the entire gamut of flyer-pushers one must go through at Ditmars. Today was ridiculous.

I found the little piece on him rather interesting, and I was glad they interviewed him and also recorded his singing. I&#039;d be more concerned for him if the piece comes across as mocking, given the clear fact that he&#039;s not really a &quot;professional singer,&quot; but as he&#039;s been a constant, harmless presence as long as I&#039;ve lived here, I&#039;ve come to associate him with Ditmars as well. <br />snowball, I&#039;ve also noticed that he seems quieter recently. He used to sing all the time, and now more often when I walk by he&#039;s kind of just standing there and talking quietly.

				I thought the article set out to show how desolate and horrible being at the end of the line is. That&#039;s ridiculous. I&#039;ve lived both in Inwood, at the end of the A (but nowhere near the end of the 1), and here in Astoria, and neither neighborhood is a wasteland of crumbling stores and mental illness, as the article seems to portray. It&#039;s kind of insulting. Clearly the reporter didn&#039;t care to see the great things about the places they went to.

Note they didn&#039;t bother mentioning the trains with last stops in Manhattan. &quot;For those subway riders who get off before the last stop — almost everyone — the end is just a sign on the train. What&#039;s there, anyway? It turns out there is often mystery, lonesomeness and beauty.&quot; The perspective kind of remind me of a friend I have who lives in Manhattan. At one point, a couple years ago, she took out her pocket subway map, and it only included Manhattan under 96th Street. For her, visiting Astoria is a trip to a mysterious foreign land.

				I grew up a few blocks from the South Ozone Park terminus of the A. I checked out that feature to see what images they had of Liberty Ave, and all they showed was a shot of a frikkin takeout menu! What a letdown.&nbsp; :cry: :x
