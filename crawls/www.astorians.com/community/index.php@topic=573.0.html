								<div class="inner" id="msg_1890">Some of you may have already seen me out on the street here in the neighborhood, handing out flyers or asking people to sign my petition. I'm running for City Council as the Green Party candidate, against the man who has the job now, Democrat/Republican Peter Vallone Jr.<br /><br />Matt suggested I post to <a href="http://www.astorians.net" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">Astorians.net</a> to let people know a little bit about my campaign and my ideas for reform. If what I write below isn't enough, and for more detailed discussion of the issues, I refer you to my website: <a href="http://www.KannForCouncil.net" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">KannForCouncil.net</a> &nbsp; Here I&#039;d just like to state more generally what&#039;s driving me to run for public office, and what I hope to accomplish.<br /><br />Before I get into that, though, I want to appeal to you to get in touch with me. And while I&#039;m all for communicating by e-mail and online forums like this one, I&#039;m really more interested in talking to people face-to-face and over the phone. So, here&#039;s my contact information:<br /><br />Jerry Kann<br />25-60 42nd Street (bet. 25th and 28th Aves., near Steinway Street), #1<br />Astoria, NY 11103<br />718-728-1092-----Cell: 646-724-9983<br /><br />I urge you to call anytime, or even stop by--though I&#039;m hardly ever home. Until November 8, you&#039;ll likely to see me at various spots around the neighborhood, such as 31st St. &amp; Ditmars Blvd.; 8th St. &amp; Astoria Blvd. (near Astoria Houses, in the &quot;Two Coves&quot; section of Astoria); or 31st St. &amp; 30th Ave., near the Trade Fair.<br /><br />I believe the average person doesn&#039;t have near enough say-so about what our government does. We all know this. But the question is, what are we prepared to do about it?<br /><br />One thing we can do is start having regular public meetings about the problems we have in this neighborhood. The topics of discussion could be everything from everyday hassles like noise pollution (motorcycles, car alarms, trucks--in short, motor vehicles) and garbage in the streets...to more ambitious topics, such as economic development in our poorer neighborhoods, like the area around Astoria Houses.<br /><br />If I&#039;m elected, I will have meetings like this at different sites around Astoria, and **regularly**--monthly or more often, not cosmetically, once a year, as the elected officials do at present. But since this is about more than just what I would be doing as Council member, in the long run I would like to get more people involved at an **official** level, at a level where people in the neighborhood would be doing more than just acting in an advisory capacity. (This is what the present Community Board does. They pass resolutions and take votes on issues--but all of their decisions are merely advisory, which makes them pretty much meaningless.) In the long run, I would like to see an **elected** Community Board, or what I like to call a &quot;Community Council,&quot; here in Astoria. My big dream is that these bodies would be established in all 51 City Council districts all over the city. (For a more detailed description of this plan, go to <a href="http://www.kannforcouncil.net/Community.htm" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.kannforcouncil.net/Community.htm</a> )<br /><br />If the members of this Board or Council were elected, they would be answerable to their neighbors, the people who elected them. The present Community Board members are appointed, and as such are accountable to the city officials who appointed them. Also, I would like them to be empowered to propose legislation to City Council. And I would want the City Council member to be required to report to them monthly. If people in City Council had to report directly to the people who pay their salaries 12 times a year, I think they&#039;d be a lot more active and a lot more responsive.<br /><br />Who would object to this? Well, a lot of people, I suppose. But no one who really believes in democracy would object. More power for each individual resident...Bringing government down to the most basic level, the community level...Leaving fewer decisions up to the super-rich people at the top of the totem pole and bringing more decision-making power down to face-to-face assemblies of working people and poor people. Why shouldn&#039;t this be our ideal?<br /><br />Would this be one big celebration of progressive values and liberal viewpoints? Of course not. It would involve everyone, so it would include all points of view. But I think two things would change:<br /><br />One, &quot;lefts&quot; and &quot;rights&quot; would find they agree on a lot more than they&#039;re used to thinking they do. This has been my experience in campaigning, talking to people of all points of view around Astoria. The &quot;red/blue&quot; divide is, I believe, largely a by-product of talk radio and newspaper columns owned and operated by (yes) super-rich people who have a keen interest in keeping working people fighting among themselves and distracting them from the shenanigans those super-rich people are perpetrating in taking over more and more of the functions of our government.<br /><br />Two, it would simply get the facts up on the table where everyone could evaluate them on the spot. For example: Con Ed wants to start storing hazardous waste on-site, on the other side of the fence on 20th Avenue. Maybe this is OK for the neighborhood (I kinda doubt it), and maybe it&#039;s not. But our public meetings would be forums where the facts could be brought to the attention of more people at the same time. Conservatives and liberals disagree on a lot--but nobody wants toxic waste and the disease it causes near their home. We couold put aside at least some of the theatrical &quot;debates&quot; over ideology and get down to practical concerns.<br /><br />Naturally people will continue to disagree on a lot of issues. But they already do, and they don&#039;t talk to each other. Facing each other could only help everybody move toward more rational policies. This requires that everybody take more responsibility. But these meetings would encourage that spirit, and promote the idea that the best policy is not the one handed down from on-high by some potentate--a mayor, a president, real estate promoter--but rather the one created by the people themselves.<br /><br />Certain things that are liable to be minority positions, however, aren&#039;t up for negotiation. For example, equal marriage laws for same-sex couples--a state issue that local elected officials should support--should become law. That&#039;s not likely to get majority support in this community, at least not in the near future. But it&#039;s the kind of position that I&#039;ll support regardless of how long it takes to get majority support for it.<br /><br />Another example is a proposal now in City Council to allow non-citizens--<br />people who are here legally but not yet citizens--to vote in local elections. I support this initiative and have since I first ran in 2001. Something like half the people who lives in Astoria are foreign-born, and many of them are not yet citizens. To leave such a large portion of the city&#039;s population out of the decision-making process is wrong.<br /><br />A fast word about Peter Vallone Jr.: It&#039;s my contention that he is not the guy for the job--unless you&#039;re fond of Big Real Estate and want them completely in charge of the city. In 2003, I checked out his campaign contributions during his first 18 months or so in office. His top single contribution was for $2500, from big Queens real estate company Pistilli Realty Group. $2500 was about what I raised altogether in 2003--he raised $200,000--and yet I got 20 percent of the vote. What this indicates to me is that Big Money sure helps, but it ain&#039;t everything. Talk to a couple thousand people in the neighborhood, as I did, and let them know you want them to be more involved, and you might well get the same results I did. Vallone Jr. and his Big Money pals aren&#039;t superhuman. Quite the contrary, they&#039;re very vulnerable, precisely because they&#039;re so out-of-touch with the community they &quot;serve.&quot;<br /><br />There&#039;s a lot more potential out there than we think there is. The tools for building a better community are right there in the existing structure for elections, in just making a case for a more democratic Astoria to our fellow voters and appealing to their better natures. It&#039;s not a sure thing. But our odds of making the changes we&#039;d like to see are a thousand times better if we participate. I think we&#039;re liable to surprise ourselves.<br /><br />Thanks for your consideration. And feel free to call or write any time you like, and I&#039;ll get back to you as soon as I can.<br /><br />Jerry Kann</div>
