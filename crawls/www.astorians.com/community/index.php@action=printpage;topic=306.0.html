				Well, John, (absent ASSed John, I believe) -- no, ASS is alive and well. &nbsp;It has not disbanded.<br /><br />The group this week had a little &quot;forgetfulness&quot; but sandwiches were eaten. &nbsp;Remotely, I enjoyed a crab cake sanwich on a toasted brioche bun with fancy tartar sauce from Clydes in Georgetown.<br /><br />It was good.<br /><br />Which brings us to phase II, ASS goes forth and spreads the word.

				It's kinda late but I thought I would make some notes from 3/19 and 26<br /><br />4/19/05<br />In Attendance: Colleen, Meesch, Matt, Jayme and John C.<br />Absent ASS: Nick<br /><br />There is no way to recall who ordered what especially I was not there on that day. &nbsp;However, according to Colleen, John C. argued that hero is not a sandwich and stormed off the ASS meeting since no one agreed with him.<br /><br />4/26/05<br />In attendance: &nbsp;Nick, Colleen, Meesch and Danielle (guest)<br /><br />Absent ASSes: Matt, Jayme and John.C (MIA since the last week's incident)<br /><br />Unfortunately I forgot who ordered what except for mine (Tuna Hero with lettuce, tomato, onion and a little bit of vinagar and oil) &nbsp;but I clearly remember that we found a new home for ASS on this very day. &nbsp;It was a relief to all ASS members present especially because of the disaster Meesch experienced at the former (and the first) ASS home.<br /><br />I have more detailed notes for 3/3/05 meeting.

				I love sandwiches -- and Freeze Peach is just a block away from THE BEST DAMN DELI IN ASTORIA: <strong>Andrew and Frank's</strong> on 23rd Ave/28th St. That place kept me alive while I was out of work with their humongous, inexpensive and delicious sandwiches...

				I cannot join you, but I want to suggest that you sample the Sandwich Shop, on the east side of steinway between 28th and 26th. Specialty is subs and pita bread sandwiches with lots of salad stuff. I went to lunch today wanting falafel, but they had none, so I got shish kabob on pita with garlic sauce and lots of stuff. Other people were having some sort of sausage and hard-boiled egg with salad. Someone had sausage, salad, 3 kinds of olives, cucumber,<br />tomato, onions, 2 kinds of peppers, french fries (!), and some white sauce or other on a hero roll.<br /><br />The ingrediants are all there to see, and look incredibly fresh. If you experts would check it out and let me know what to order next time, that would be great.<br /><br />bruce
