								<div class="inner" id="msg_12868">Its all relative, folks. <br />Back to [somewhat] the original topic:<br />I live on a pretty litter-strewn block in Astoria (34th St and B&#39;way) and yeah I HATE it when people litter. Like TRX, I&#39;m from Southern California and I too grew up with another sort of litter: air pollution and gridlock in lieu of street pollution. So compared to that, Astoria is cleaner (more walking) but yet walled with trash.<br />On the other end of the spectrum, you must compare Astoria with more problematic places. Like BUSHWICK, Brooklyn. That&#39;s where I lived before moving here. For those of your who don&#39;t frequent our borough to the south, I tell you: not only is Bushwick socio-economically deprived, but the trash on the streets is 100X worse than Astoria. I was often among the only young women walking down the street; women and children were rarely out after nightfall. My single grocery store took more EBT/WIC than they did cash and credit cards. There is a lot of crime in Bushwick. A LOT. Both petty and violent. When my neighbors were jumped on the way home from the subway station, I asked the cops what I should do to protect myself. They said &quot;move out&quot;. They didn&#39;t care that white kids were being mugged when they had crack head shootouts a block over. <br />My point is that in certain communities, there is no respect because of a myriad of factors: ignorance, of course but also because they have no incentive to participate in the Social Contract when they look around them and see no infrastructure.<br />There was a car on fire on my street one winter. Seriously. A burning carcass of a car. I thought it would explode. I called 311 and then the local police. That car continued burning for 24 more hours until it just burned out and then kids started playing in its ruins. Then addicts started living in it. The city did nothing for weeks. The sanitation department gave me the run around. <br /><br />Now I ask you, if you lived in a place like that, why would you bother throwing your gum wrapper in an [over-stuffed, festering] wastebasket? You don&#39;t feel like you make a difference. The ridiculous potholes and broken streetlights tell you that the city has also forsaken you. Your main concern is probably to avoid getting mugged, not placing litter in the correct receptacle.<br /><br />Here is where I lean toward JTrane&#39;s opinion. The Social Contract requires that both society and the individual uphold their ends of the agreement so that we can all co-exist in humane conditions. But if you&#39;re unluck enough to be born a black man in Bushwick, for example, you&#39;re accustomed to society not really holding up its end of the bargain: to provide every person with equal oppertunities for health and happiness. I do not see the free market mentality as helpful because capitalism pivots around profit. That is its purpose. There is no immediate profit in patching up the Social Contract.

Shouldn&#39;t education be considered part of that safety net?<br /><br />It still shocks me that people accept the poor education that so many of the nations children recieve and then blame them when they can&#39;t get ahead in life because they never learned to put a sentence together</div>

Including values, valued choices. You can choose a business based on efficiency, based on social policies, (look what happened for South Africa) ...<br />The profit motive works wonders, it helps determine who is succeeding with resources, but it is not the only motive. And I would fear if we had only one forced choice in govt control or social service.<br />Not all not-for-profits merit support.<br /><br />&#39;what profits a man if he gains the world and loses his soul&#39; )<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=1964.msg12868#msg12868">Quote from: annie on April 19, 2006, 11:47:52 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Its all relative, folks. <br />Back to [somewhat] the original topic:<br />I live on a pretty litter-strewn block in Astoria (34th St and B&#39;way) and yeah I HATE it when people litter. Like TRX, I&#39;m from Southern California and I too grew up with another sort of litter: air pollution and gridlock in lieu of street pollution. So compared to that, Astoria is cleaner (more walking) but yet walled with trash.<br />On the other end of the spectrum, you must compare Astoria with more problematic places. Like BUSHWICK, Brooklyn. That&#39;s where I lived before moving here. For those of your who don&#39;t frequent our borough to the south, I tell you: not only is Bushwick socio-economically deprived, but the trash on the streets is 100X worse than Astoria. I was often among the only young women walking down the street; women and children were rarely out after nightfall.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Your main concern is probably to avoid getting mugged, not placing litter in the correct receptacle.<br /><br />Here is where I lean toward JTrane&#39;s opinion. The Social Contract requires that both society and the individual uphold their ends of the agreement so that we can all co-exist in humane conditions. But if you&#39;re unluck enough to be born a black man in Bushwick, for example, you&#39;re accustomed to society not really holding up its end of the bargain: to provide every person with equal oppertunities for health and happiness. I do not see the free market mentality as helpful because capitalism pivots around profit. That is its purpose. There is no immediate profit in patching up the Social Contract. This all relates to Malcolm Gladwell&#39;s tipping point, Freakonomics, and of course the famed &quot;broken window&quot; theory.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></div>
