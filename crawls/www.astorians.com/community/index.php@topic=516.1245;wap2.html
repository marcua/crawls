			Well, Hello.<br />&nbsp;<br />I&#039;ve been in Astoria for more than 20 years, beginning when Little Egypt on Steinway consisted of, well, Ali.<br />&nbsp;<br />I found this forum twice through google in the last couple of days, as I tried to find out what happened to the Pasha eatery and if anyone else hates A-1 Courier service for Amazon as I do.&nbsp; I figured it must be kismet<br />&nbsp;<br />Astoria is definitely a Herakleitan experience.&nbsp; Panta reis, ouden menes.

			Hi all, <br /><br />I&#039;ve lived in Astoria for 1 year.&nbsp; Just found out about this awesome forum.&nbsp; Want to become a bit more active on this thing, looks like there&#039;s a bigger community then I imagined.&nbsp; I live near the Costco area.<br />

			Hi Everyone,<br />I recently moved to Astoria back in July from Jackson Heights. I used to go to St.John&#039;s Prep so I became familiar with the area, but once I graduated h.s, I never came back to Astoria. I haven&#039;t gone out so much due to always being tired from work. But another reason is because I don&#039;t know many people out here, and it gets lonely at times since most of my friends live far from me. Are there any good places to meet nice people in mid to late 20s in Astoria? Bars sound reasonable but a change from bars would be preferable.&nbsp; :cheesy:

			Hello!<br /><br />I&#039;m actually an LIC/Astoria native, but I love my neighborhood and thought I&#039;d head onto this forum to connect with some other locals. Several years back someone actually helped me find my lost dog on here!<br />

			Hello everyone, my name is Edward, although some people call me Ted. I am a fourteen year old high school student at The Bronx High School of Science, and I live right here in Astoria. Currently I am doing an English paper about the G&amp;T schools in Astoria, as this topic means quite a bit to me and I easily relate to it.&nbsp; That sounds about it really, I can&#039;t think of anything else to say. It&#039;s nice to meet you all, and I will try my best to stay active even after this English paper!
