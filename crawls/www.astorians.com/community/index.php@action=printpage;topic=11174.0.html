				If you plan on going to LIC to watch the fireworks, plan on going very early. We went two years ago&nbsp; ( or was it three) and went to Gantry Park. We figured it was going to be full, but we didn&#039;t count on it being as packed as it ended up being. We showed up around 6:30, if I remember correctly, and by 8 o&#039;clock it was PACKED, wall to wall people as far as the eye could see. And when I say packed I mean that they were limiting the amount of people that they were letting onto the piers, and certain areas were for residents of the&nbsp; Rockrose Towers only.

				You can kinda sorta see them from my rooftop, so that&#039;s where I&#039;ll be.&nbsp; Our roof is normally closed, but the building opens it on the 4th.

				Someone mentioned seeing them over the Citibank building, so I wonder if I can see them from my window (32nd between Bway and 31st ave, unimpeded view of the Citibank building). What about from Socrates Park? Is that too far north?
