				I hate the bar down the street from me. I can understand crazy loud bass beats and music till all hours on the weekend (i suppose...) but during the week? give me a break.<br />AND everytime I walk by there&#039;s never anybody in there?! who do they have this bass up for?<br /><br />I&#039;m half a block away from it and have resorted to sleeping with earplugs every night. sheesh.

				see, that&#039;s the thing, i don&#039;t even think it&#039;s technically a bar. <br /><br />It&#039;s called Cafe Blue Light (and as far as I can tell I see nothing cafe-ish or blue light-ish about it) on 30th and 35th Ave.<br /><br /><br />

				Keep copies of the reference numbers 311 gives you and call them back, often, to find out what happened with the case. This is my version of the squeaky wheel theory!

				Keep calling 311 and keep a log of the complaints.&nbsp; You should be calling the local Councilmember as well and the Community Board, as well as the 114th precinct.

				This is what happens when a place starts to lose money and has to do things differently to keep money coming in, promoters, louder music, less care with the clientele they attract.&nbsp; NuBar, on Broadway, is the bane of my existence periodically.&nbsp; They were quiet for 12 + years and never a problem and then in the last year, egads, the noise, the crowds, the lack of concern.

				As a wine/beer cafe owner in Astoria , I understand .<br />One thing we refused to do , is let people perform live music after 11PM weekdays and midnight weekends..<br /><br />What I don&#039;t get is this.<br /><br />If the place sounds like this outside, how the heck can you hope to sit inside.?<br /><br />Music can be engaging and fun without killing the idea of social inter-action.<br />( too many wi-fi coffee houses do this silently already ) <br /><br />I&#039;m sorry that these places put a &quot;spot&quot; on those of us that are fighting hard to keep the <br />noise down , while somehow bringing the noise to the people who come out to socialize and <br />have fun. <br /><br />Try 311 , although its slow and cumbersome, try going to the place and talking to them..<br />One thing they do understand I can assure you , is lack of business and if they <br />continue to ignore you and your attempts to be cool neighbors , tell everyone you know <br />it will eventually come around that its hurting business to tick off your nieghbors..<br /><br />At Waltz, we respect our neighbors and anyone who dosen&#039;t while at our place is <br />taken to task. If we find our words fall on deaf ears, we simply don&#039;t have those musicians back.<br />The most effective way is to run a business like this is to stay open, stay cool, and most of all <br />respect your &quot;Location , Location ,Location &quot; <br /><br />

				OK, so it&#039;s 2:42 AM and I just called and made my first 311 complaint about the bar down the street. They were very nice and helpful (even considering my groggy, very pissed off state).<br /><br />So, here&#039;s a question: what&#039;s &quot;reasonable&quot; to expect a bar to quiet down their throbbing drum &#039;n bass music on the weekend (fri/sat)? 1? 2?<br /><br /><br />

				So continue my 2AM chronicles....<br /><br />went to bed at 1230 to wonderful crystal clear quiet....woke at 215AM (on a sunday night!!) to Yugoslavian singing and bass. Called 311 again and complained. <br /><br />my question is this: What else can I do?<br /><br />My right my only thoughts are to:<br />1. continue calling 311 every single night of the week on this club, eventually becoming best friends with the operators<br />2. go and party every time i&#039;m pissed off at the bar with the Slavs<br /><br />it&#039;s funny, on the photos of their building on their website, i can actually see my building in the background. i don&#039;t know why that makes my laugh, maybe it&#039;s my lack of sleep.<br /><br />http://www.cafebluelight.com/<br /><br />

				I would choose option 2!&nbsp; If you can&#039;t beat &#039;em, join &#039;em.&nbsp; Seriously, if you&#039;re not getting anywhere with 311, you should dial the 114th directly and ask to speak to someone, perhaps a Community Affairs officer&nbsp; All 311 does, essentially, is forward your complaint to the 114th anyway.&nbsp; Maybe if you have some time, you can go to the 114th and speak to someone in person.&nbsp; I had a similar issue with a club/bar/brothel down the street from my old apartment on 36th Avenue and I ended up having a really good and productive conversation with a lieutant at the 114th.&nbsp; <br /><br />If that fails, try Eric Gioia, your city councilman (I think your still in his district).&nbsp; I find him to be pretty responsive.&nbsp; <br /><br />Good luck and tell us how it goes!

				Hell, now that you&#039;ve seen their website, I&#039;d send &#039;em an email.&nbsp; They may not listen, but an e-mail is legally binding and shows proof that you have contacted them and made them aware of the situation.<br /><br />Grrr.&nbsp; just checked and they don&#039;t have an e-mail listed.&nbsp; :(&nbsp; Where there&#039;s a will, there&#039;s a way.&nbsp; I will find an email address because I am now determined!<br /><br />

				Calling the precinct direct is a great suggestion.&nbsp; <br /><br />Last year, in a different neighborhood, I called my local precinct at 4am to complain about a car radio that had been blasting on my street for almost an hour.&nbsp; &nbsp;I asked the nice officer who answered if there were any patrol cars in the area that might have a word with the noisemakers.&nbsp; &nbsp;He answered &quot;no prob!&quot;&nbsp; One minute later, a police car drove up, and the car-party couldn&#039;t turn off their radio fast enough.&nbsp; &nbsp;Hearing those obnoxious jerks get all sheepish with their repeated &quot;Sorry, Officer&quot; --&gt; that moment was like Christmas, my birthday, and payday all rolled into one.<br /><br />I&#039;d called 311 earlier that night with no results.&nbsp; They probably forwarded the complaint to the precinct, but maybe they all get collected in an e-file somewhere that never sees the light of day.<br /><br />Good luck with your noise problem.&nbsp; The phone number for the 114th is (718) 626-9311.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;
