				I am looking for a daycare in Astoria or Astoria Ditmars for my baby who is 5 months, and thought I would like some input (there were some threads but they were more than 2 years old and not limited to infants less than a year)<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m thinking Astoria Daycare (learning Odyssey), Bluebird, Happy days daycare. But I am sure I am missing some. I&#039;m also open to family-home daycare but have not looked into them. Any first-hand advice would be greatly appreciated. <br /><br /><br />Thanks in advance!

				We used A Learning Odyssey and absolutely loved it.&nbsp; &nbsp;We always felt safe leaving our daughter with them, knowing that she would be well cared for and attended to.

				We&#039;ve begun looking into infant daycare as well. A Learning Odyssey seems kind of pricey and has fees that other daycares we&#039;ve looked into don&#039;t charge. I noticed on their website they have after school care for kids in the neighborhood. Do you know if they keep those kids in the same place as the infants? The place looks small and it doesn&#039;t seem like they keep the daycare kids separated by age, so I&#039;m wondering what they do with the after school kids. <br /><br />We&#039;ll probably end up using a place near my job, but wanted a back up in case the waiting list at the place we chose is too long.<br />
