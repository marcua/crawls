				Hi All!&nbsp; I&#039;m new to Astoria and looking forward to getting to know the neighborhood.&nbsp; My first line of business is a good cafe!&nbsp; :-) A place with good coffee, snacks and a low-key vibe (not too noisy, as I have some work-related stuff to do).&nbsp; Internet connection would be an added plus.&nbsp; I&#039;m looking for something in the Ditmars area, other than Starbuck ;-)&nbsp; Thanks!

				Freeze Peach should be your first stop. I&#039;m sure others will have more suggestions, too.

				Congratulations for finally moving to the best neighborhood in Queens!<br /><br />You should not miss an opportunity to check out Cafe Soleil, on 37th St. &amp; Astoria Blvd.&nbsp; They recently re-opened, and I&#039;m soo thankful!&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Soleil has top-notch teas and coffee, very cozy ambiance and <strong>free wi-fi</strong> that will be coming in a week or so.&nbsp; The owners are really friendly and take good care of you.&nbsp; <br /><br />Why bother with Starbucks when local is better!&nbsp; :mrgreen: <br /><br />&nbsp;

				Waltz Astoria (Ditmars and 24th) is pretty quiet on the weekends. I was doing some homework there last Sunday. They have free wifi as long as you purchase something every half hour, according to their sign on the wall. I got a really yummy strawberry slushie last time.

				Two of my favorite spots in Astoria are Martha&#039;s, on Ditmars and 37th Street, which recently added outdoor seating but does not have the same &quot;vibe&quot; as the 30th Avenue cafes, and Cafe Bar, on 34th Avenue and 36th Street.&nbsp; Martha&#039;s is a good choice for coffee and a pastry...not much in the way of snack foods, whereas Cafe Bar offers lots of sandwiches and snacks, as well as a pretty large coffee and tea selection but less in the way of desserts or pastries.&nbsp;

				Good choice on moving to the Ditmars hood.&nbsp; I live on 30th ave and while we certainly have a lot of those cafe spots that you&#039;re interested in... thats all we have over Ditmars.&nbsp; Forget a cafe... the little wine bar next to Fatty&#039;s (Ditmars and Crescent) would be a good spot to chill with some coffee and a laptop.&nbsp; Might want to call about wifi first.&nbsp; And you have to try the food at trattoria l&#039;Incontro, just off the corner of 31st street and Ditmars.&nbsp; They have awesome italian fare and pride themselves on having a ludicrous littany of specials.&nbsp; YUM.&nbsp; Check it out.<br /><br />Welcome to the neighborhood.<br /><br />

They also do not typically open until 5, which might be a little late for the cafe type.<br /><br />In the Ditmars area, Freeze Peach and Martha&#039;s are both great suggestions. Oleput, when it is not remodeling (I think they are open now) is another good place to kick back with wifi and a beverage. <br /><br />I&#039;m also a big fan of Cafe Soliel. They are very relaxed with super comfy seating. From the Ditmars area, it is a tad of a trek, but when I lived on Crescent and Ditmars, the quality and quantity of time I spent at the Astoria Blvd and 37th st cafe was worth the walk.

				I don&#039;t know if the coffee bar under the Ditmars stop (street level on the same side as Chase) is still open but they had a sign up about WiFi as well.

				Another vote for Waltz here.&nbsp; It just exudes a relaxed vibe the minute you walk in.

I&#039;ve been looking forward to this backlash for years now. <br /><br />As a quaint, old-fashioned person I like being able to sit and chat or read for a bit in a coffee shop and not walking in and seeing every seat occupied by people parked at laptops for the past 6 hours (I get to do that at my office). I think if a few places adopt a no-laptop policy while the majority continue to allow them we&#039;ll have a nice balance. Too bad I live on 30th and we only seem to have loud techno cafes.
