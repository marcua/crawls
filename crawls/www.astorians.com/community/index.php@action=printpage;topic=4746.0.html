				Hi Everyone,<br /><br />We are a young professional couple looking for a 2 or 3 bedroom new construction or recently (and nicely) renovated if it is in a Pre-war bldg. Okay with Private House also. These are our parameters: <br />&nbsp;<br />* 3 block radius from N/W stops from 30 Ave to Ditmars (except for the Astoria Blvd Stop). <br /><br />* We have a dining rm set, Living rm furniture, bedrm furniture, so SPACE is very important. If it is a walk-up not higher than 2nd Floor. No weird layouts pls.<br /><br />* We don&#39;t have pets. <br /><br />* Ocassional smokers but do not like apt. smelling like smoke so don&#39;t do it often inside. <br /><br />* We are available to see apts evenings 6:30pm onwards and on weekends. If you have something that sounds similar to what we&#39;re looking for, please contact me. <br /><br />* MARCH 1st move-in date prfd, but flexible for mid February. <br /><br />* Will pay up to 2,000k per month for the right apartment- clean, renovated, taken care of- we will take care of it also. <br /><br />* PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT ME IF YOU DON&#39;T HAVE AN ACTUAL APARTMENT TO SHOW. <br /><br />Thank you! <br />Karen.. 718-938-1738 or reply by posting here..

				Thanks both for your replies.. we have actually seen mostly renovated apts but they are too small for both a dining and lv rm set. I currently live in a one bedroom that fits both (and isn&#39;t &quot;huge&quot;), so I know that it is not impossible to find what we&#39;re looking for, especially for a 2 or 3 Bedroom. We definitely would like to stay within walking distance of the N/W and have time to search...<br /><br />Not sure what you meant by &quot;owners &amp; Brokers only&quot; attitude though (??). I figure that if I am as clear as possible, I won&#39;t get responses that don&#39;t really fit the criteria we&#39;re looking for... but I think I know what you&#39;re talking about- I copied/pasted this from my craigslist posting where mostly owners and brokers look and I asked not to be contacted unless you have a property to show.. that was to avoid bogus calls.. but I can see where on a post like this it doesn&#39;t fit in. Thanks for making me aware..

				Though I can appreciate Bentley&#39;s Pa comments, I also urge you to stick with it!&nbsp; Two grand a month is a pretty healthy amount for a two bedroom and it allows you to be choosy.&nbsp; It might mean that you have to be actively aggressive in finding a place and/or eat the broker fee, but places like that do exist and they can be had.<br /><br />I say this because everytime I look for an apartment I always specify that I want a plantable backyard.&nbsp; 90% of the brokers and owners then tell me that those places are impossible to find and that I&#39;d have to ease up on what I ask for.&nbsp; But after alot of legwork, I always find nice places with kick butt backyards.<br /><br />Good luck!

				Thanks Frappe! I know that we will find what we&#39;re looking for, just will take a lot of legwork, which we are willing to do-- we want to find a place where we will stay in for a couple of yours and can grow in, so that&#39;s why we&#39;re being so particular and giving ourselves time.. we&#39;re willing to pay, but we have to be happy with it.. so thanks for the support!&nbsp; :mrgreen:
