				Hello all,<br /><br />My husband and I are looking for a 1 BR and saw a nice one in 25-98 36th St. but are having some concerns about the building. We&#39;ve put down a deposit with a broker and are awaiting &#39;approval&#39;,&nbsp; Do you know anything good, bad or otherwise? Any hints, gossip, feelings would be really appreciated. Also, any hints you may have about $1300 and less 1 BRs in Astoria are greatly appreciated.<br /><br />Here&#39;s what gives us specific pause about the location:<br /><br />Saturday, October 14: <br />&quot;At 25-98 36th St., a 36-year-old black male threatened a victim with a bat. He was charged with menacing, criminal possession of a weapon and harassment.&quot;<br />www.qgazette.com/news/2006/1018/features/011.html <br /><br />and <br /><br />&quot;25-98 36th St Astoria, NY 11103 - the whole building has bedbugs!!! &quot;<br />bedbugblog.blogspot.com/2006/06/known-bedbug-infestations.html <br /><br />

				I&#39;d be worried about the bedbugs - they are extremely hard to get rid of - especially in an apartment blg.&nbsp; And if this person says the whole blg is infested, I&#39;m inclined to beleive them.&nbsp; My best advice - RUN!!&nbsp; Far away.&nbsp; Find another blg to rent into.<br /><br />In terms of safety, I don&#39;t think you have anything to worry about in Astoria.&nbsp; Astoria is pretty safe, and everything that does happen here could happen in any nieghborhood, and couldn&#39;t be characterized as specific to Astoria.&nbsp; A monster waving a bat can happen anywhere.

				I wouldn&#39;t fret none about the baseball bat thing, but the bedbugs is a real source of concern. &nbsp;If I was in your position:<br /><br />1. &nbsp;$1300 is a fair amount of money to pay for a one bedroom&nbsp;You can certainly find other one bedrooms for that type of money in more prime areas. &nbsp;So I&#39;d continue looking for another place. &nbsp;Look at craig&#39;s list. &nbsp;You&#39;ll find alot of places for that sort of money. &nbsp;<br /><br />2. &nbsp;If you want the place. &nbsp;Ask the broker. &nbsp;I&#39;m sure he or she will stonewall you because they care little more than getting their fee. &nbsp;I&#39;d then ask to inspect the apartment again. &nbsp;This is not a bad site to see for tell tale signs of bedbugs. &nbsp;http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/pesticides/bedbugs.html. &nbsp;Problem is that they travel easily within a building. &nbsp;I&#39;d then get a reassurance from the landlord that they&#39;ll spring for an exterminator in the event of an infestation and if they don&#39;t you&#39;ll take it out of the rent. &nbsp;NYC renting laws are heavily in favor of the tennants.<br /><br />Personally, even though it might be the settling of a grudge, I wouldn&#39;t take that type of chance with bedbugs unless the place was really rockin

				Is this 36th between Astoria Blvd and 28th Ave?<br /><br />The 30s in that stretch -- 35, 36, 37, 38th streets -- I walk between a lot and there always seem to be matresses out in the trash.&nbsp; This is something of a bad sign, I think.&nbsp; Bedbugs are likely.<br /><br />

				Thanks so much everyone about your perspectives on the value of the apartment. The &quot;deposit&quot; was said to be refundable unless the actual lease was signed so I hope that&#39;s not a problem. Thanks for the heads-up though and we will be wary.<br /><br />We&#39;re not going to go forward with the signing of the lease; even the threat of the bedbugs is increasingly frightening and it sounds as though we could do better for the price. If you have any leads on specific buildings, pls. post!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I hope you didn&#39;t put down a deposit without signing a lease!&nbsp; As discussed in other threads on here, be careful about the whole &quot;deposit&quot; thing.&nbsp; Don&#39;t ever give money without first signing something (specifically a lease) and having a guarantee of either the apartment you want being yours or getting your money back without hassle if the lease falls through.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Thank you! It won&#39;t be for a while. I used to work for a PI many, many years ago and I would go to a city building way downtown to get this stuff--microfiche, etc. But I had no idea you could now do it online and get those violations. How amazing!<br /><br />

Tell him you are giving him 30 days to receive and have the check clear your bank or will will start legal proceedings against him. Small claims court should do just fine. You do have a legal document for the deposit stating the amount and the stipulations for its return, don&#39;t you?

				You guys are awesome! The broker we worked with (Eva @ Buy/Sell) did indeed return ALL of the deposit money, in cash, and was quite nice about it. We showed her the info you guys passed on and she said she wanted the URL to print out and share. So there are some people who are legitimate. In my experience, she is a straight shooter and I would reccomend her with the usual caveat emptor language.<br /><br />Thank you so much; we were ready to take the apt and for some reason couldn&#39;t pull up the DOB web site so you REALLY saved us. Great online community.&nbsp; :-)

				and actually.. iwas just walking past buy/sell realty and they still have an ad in their window for this place, so its just a matter of time before someone takes it.<br />i mean i really wanted to go in there and make them take it down, it should be illegal to knowingly (since they returned the deposit money) advertise an apartment that is infested with bedbugs.<br />i felt like knocking on vallone&#39;s door.

				wow.&nbsp; i thought this place sounded familiar - eva at buy/sell showed me this place back in december.&nbsp; i took another one she showed in the end. but i do remember not liking the condition of this apt and the building (smells from the hallways, textured stucco ceilings and finishes).&nbsp; she said at the time that people move in and out of the building all the time so vacancies do come up.&nbsp; i remember thinking the location was good.&nbsp; i&#39;m so glad i didn&#39;t take it!<br /><br />buy/sell was professional enough to deal with my apt in the end (how much do they really have to do anyhow?), but this practice of showing this building to unsuspecting clients is nasty.
