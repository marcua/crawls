There used to be 4â€“5 in Manhattan and, I don&#039;t even remember how many, on Long Island. I guess NY is not a good environment for good donuts! So, how come there is a DD on every second corner?

				I don&#039;t know what happened. I used to know the location of 7 on Long Island when I worked there, but I noticed them closing very quickly over the last couple of years. There was one in the mall across from Ikea that lasted less than 2 years, and in Melville there was one that opened up in January of 2006 on RT. 110 and closed in June of the same year. There are some in CT though.

				I used to go to the one on Third Avenue every few times I was in the City to have the pups groomed. Since I have 3 hours to kill, and they were right next door to a McDonald&#039;s, I would buy myself a cup of coffee and read the newspaper, and then I would go next door and I would buy 2 dozen Original Krispy Kreme&#039;s and get my free 2 dozen. I would make them pack them in the 6 donut boxes. Then I would go around to all my wonderfully helpful neighbors and give them each a box. I also left one box at the groomers when I picked up my clean, sweet smelling babies. That email with the &quot;one free&quot; coupon reminded me how long it had been since I did this. I am really shocked. I never thought of Krispy Kreme as a flash in the pan, and I haven&#039;t read anything about them being in financial trouble. I guess they made some very bad choice about their franchisees.

				Or I guess New Yorkers didn&#039;t really appreciate a better donut!! Personally DD sucks as of the last 10 years, their donuts I mean, not their coffee.

				Call me nuts, but I&#039;ve developed a real liking for McDonald&#039;s new coffee. Have you tried it in the past couple of years? I sometimes indulge myself to a treat of a drive-thru coffee. Today I had an iced coffee there. It was so much better than either DD&#039;s or Starbucks.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=10710.msg131473.html#msg131473">Quote from: Astoria Luv on June 03, 2008, 09:46:34 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">http://www.cfo.com/printable/article.cfm/4007436<br /><br />The article basically sums up the rise and fall of Krispy Kreme.&nbsp; It&#039;s from 2005 so I don&#039;t know if their business has been able to rebound.&nbsp; Given the fact that they have closed several locations in Manhattan and none are opening, it doesn&#039;t seem like it, at least not here.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>WOW!

				I&#039;ve always liked McDonald&#039;s coffee. Better than Dunkin Donuts. I&#039;ve had a few friends laugh at me<br />when they see me with a Mickey D&#039;s bag only to find coffee inside......

				Just wondering, is patronizing Krispy Kreme kind of a vote against Dunkin&#039; Donuts?&nbsp; DD recently pulled their ads with Rachel Ray wearing a scarf that some nuts thought made her look like a terrorism advocate because they thought it looked like a keffiyah, a scarf that is widely worn across the Arab world.&nbsp; Apparently the ad was pulled essentially because it was seen as making Rachel Ray look too Arab.
