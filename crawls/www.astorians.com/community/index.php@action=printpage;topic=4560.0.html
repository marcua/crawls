				This may just be a memo everybody else got growing up but I didn&#39;t, but... since I don&#39;t know where to find it I thought I&#39;d ask you fine people.&nbsp; Where can I get plain old garden variety matches to light votive candles and such?&nbsp; I ran out and haven&#39;t noticed any lying around at the restaurants and bars where I&#39;ve been lately for some reason.&nbsp; Don&#39;t really want to wait around until I see some and Amazon wants to charge me almost $8 to ship them here.&nbsp; Eck.&nbsp; This has to be an easy one.&nbsp; Anyone?&nbsp; &nbsp;:?

				I got two big boxes of wooden matches from King Penny a few months ago. Each box has 250 matches. The only problem is they kind of stink unusually strongly for matches, but they do work well and the candle gets rid of the match smell soon enough. It was a good deal too, whatever it was.

				Why would anyone want Strike Anywhere matches--if that means you can really strike them on anything?&nbsp; Safety matches are called that because you can strike them only on the box.&nbsp; Any supermarket ought to have them.

				I&#39;ve used Strike Anywhere matches for years.&nbsp; They work well for my needs, and I don&#39;t strike them anywhere else besides the box because I can&#39;t get them to light up anywhere else!&nbsp; :D<br /><br />I feel more at ease with wooden matches (opposed to match books), regardless if they are safety or strike anywhere.&nbsp; Good to know about finding wooden matches at the 99cent store.&nbsp; I am in need of matches myself so I&#39;ll check it out.

				Strike Anywhere matches remind me of the Anarchist Cookbook.&nbsp; I believe they are illegal in my home state of New Jersey.&nbsp; I guess they&#39;re good for camping for some reason?<br /><br />Speaking of matches, who else has to light their stove?

				Yeah my last place in Wisconsin had all of one grounded outlet in the entire apartment.&nbsp; I had all types of wires tastelessly hidden and not-so-hidden snaking around the place to run everything.&nbsp; Not to mention the 50&#39; ethernet cable I ran from the tv room to my bedroom because I was too cheap to get a wireless card for my desktop.&nbsp; Good times.
