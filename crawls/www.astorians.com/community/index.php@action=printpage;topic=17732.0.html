				Does anyone know anything about the Astoriana condos on 37th Street? I am wondering if they are as slapped together as the condos on 31st street. Here is the link: http://www.astorianacondos.com/

				Looks like the same stuff.&nbsp; Small, overpriced apartments with no amenities.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know at what point having a terrace and stainless steel appliances became the watermark of luxury.

				The 2 bedrooms that go for 699K, well the second bedroom is actually in the basement.<br /><br />30K difference between the second and third floors but there are no views here in order to explain why there is a 30K difference.<br /><br />No elevators, no lobby, nothing luxurious about the place.<br /><br />Rooms seem kinda cozy but at the same time it seems like the walls are caving in on you.<br />You should go there for yourself and write a review.<br /><br />Final verdict<br />Overpriced to the max.

				The developers are just collectively lowering standards so that eventually, 1) there will be no choice and 2) a new generation will never have known better.<br /><br />Really crazy how they just can&#039;t skip the &quot;luxury&quot; pretense and fill up the apartments for a moderate price. People would flock to an apartment complex called &quot;Average Living&quot; or &quot;Middle Class Gardens&quot; if the prices would be adjusted accordingly.
