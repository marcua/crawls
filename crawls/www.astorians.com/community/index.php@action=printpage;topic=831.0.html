				Uh, for the benefit of non-Astorians out there 14th Street in Astoria (http://maps.google.com/maps?q=14th+Street,+astoria+new+york&amp;spn=0.023158,0.034206&amp;hl=en) is pretty far from Ditmars, the Subway and the Park. 14th <em>Place</em> is altogether different, though it's still a hike to Ditmars shopping (essentially between 29th St and Steinway)

				That’s a pretty funny post for all the &quot;non-astorians&quot;-- the previous poster clearly falls into that category. &nbsp;I actually live in the apartment and yes it IS about 100 feet from Astoria Park-- 14th Place is one block over (Google maps don't show you everything). &nbsp;<br /><br />The house is right off the intersection of 14th Street and Astoria Park South. &nbsp;<br /><br />I suppose what you consider a long walk depends on the length of time you've been in New York, but it takes me and my wife less than ten minutes to walk over to Ditmars blvd from my apartment and between 10-15 minutes to walk to the subway. &nbsp;The Ditmars shopping, is about a 15-20 minute walk one way. &nbsp;If you fear this kind of movement in your life, may I kindly suggest that you might be living in the wrong city. &nbsp;After a few years of walking those distances, I'm in great shape. &nbsp;The walk to the subway is actually a pleasant way to start and end the day. &nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks for contributing, captain.
