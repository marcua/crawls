				Howdy all - I will soon be moving to Astoria around 36th street and 31st avenue.&nbsp; I&#39;m an NYU graduate and was somewhat addicted to local coffee shops like Cafe Pick Me Up or 71 Irving when I was a student and I&#39;m looking to find something similar, if possible, in Astoria.&nbsp; I don&#39;t really care so much about the actual coffee (I don&#39;t care for the stuff, prefer tea or hot chocolate), as much as I do the atmosphere and whatnot.&nbsp; Is there anything nice and quaint like this around in Astoria, especially in the area I&#39;ll be living?&nbsp; Thanks in advance for any help you can provide.&nbsp; <br /><br />MW

				The only place that really has that vibe is Freezepeach, and that&#39;s a hike--Ditmars area around...um, I&#39;m going to say 29th st.<br /><br />Closer to where you are is the Himalayan Tea House, which I&#39;m told is a nice, chill teahouse even though it looks like a restaurant.

				Freezepeach is amazing. Great quiet vibe, nice people and a huge selection of teas that are brewed upon order. Create your own or go with a conconction they&#39;ve already created.&nbsp; Hot chocolate, chai and fresh brewed iced teas are also available.<br />Indeed this is 2 subway stops from where you will be living but not terribly far.<br /><br />Another place is Cafe/Bar on 34th Avenue.&nbsp; It&#39;s a combo, cafe, restaurant/ bar and has a funky feel.&nbsp; I enjoy the cheese platters, nescafe frappe or a Stella Artois.<br /><br />Welcome to the neighborhood in advance.<br /><br />nicsop

				I second the recommendation for Cafe Bar! (34th Ave and 36th street.) Freeze Peach is nice- been there once or twice- but it is a hike for us Broadway area folk.

				I always assumed Cafe Bar was one of those noisy Greek places.&nbsp; I need to check it out.

				Yes, Cafe Bar is a very nice place.&nbsp; I&#39;ve enjoyed my times there.<br /><br />There&#39;s also Wassi on 28th Ave.&nbsp; But they&#39;re heading into more of the loungey feel these days.&nbsp; <br /><br />Love Freeze Peach and I also enjoy Waltz at times.&nbsp; Haven&#39;t been to Himalayan Tea House, but would like to check it out sometime.

				As a former resident of Seattle, this list is depressingly meager.&nbsp; <br />It&#39;s fine if you live by Cafe Bar or Freezepeach (you only need to live near one great coffee place)&nbsp; - but we&#39;re a haul from both locations...<br /><br />Where&#39;s the coffeeshop/bookstore???&nbsp; &nbsp;:cry: :cry: :cry:<br /><br />

				The coffeeshop/bookstore is where Staples and that new whateverthehell it is have gone up instead&nbsp; :x<br /><br />Cool thing about Freezepeach is the webcam- problem is, it&#39;s usually full whenever I have the time &amp; inclination to go there&nbsp; :-P

				If you are willing to try something different, walk on up to steinway north of 30th ave and try one of the middle eastern cafes. Lots of character, very nice people, good tea and you can sit for hours.&nbsp; And yes ther will be hooka pipe smoke too but some think it smells nice.&nbsp;

				i second the hooka bars along steinway!&nbsp; the mint tea is delicious and lemon sheesha!<br /><br />i also live in the 36th st/ 31st ave area but on a recent walk passed by a cool little spot on 30th ave around 45th st.&nbsp; i think it&#39;s an italian bakery so should have good espresso-- yet to give it a try.<br /><br />frank&#39;s has amazing coffee (36th st and 30th ave) along with delicious breads and cookies (and ice cream cakes!!!) but unfortunately no place to sit. <br /><br />the former dacine (yet to be opened place on 30th ave and 34th st) used to be okay to chill and read (not really a coffee shop but cafe) but who knows what vibe the new place will have.<br /><br />also, cafe bar.&nbsp; weekend brunches in the summer especially are great.&nbsp; day time crowd is chill enough to relax in but does get a little &quot;pumping&quot; at night...

				You might like Himilayan tea house.. It feels more like a restaurant, but there is never anyone there.<br />
