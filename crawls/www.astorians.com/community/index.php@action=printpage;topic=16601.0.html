				hello astorians!<br /><br />here&#039;s my first listing on this website. i guess i should introduce myself, too.<br /><br />my name&#039;s christina and i&#039;m an assistant teacher in a preschool in the city. i have a degree in early childhood development and have been working with children for the past 5 years. i have experience working with infants and children up to 6 years old. i&#039;m infant/child cpr certified as well as some basic first aid. for those of you who are concerned about the flu(s), i&#039;ve also had training in infectious diseases. (a new requirement by law for those who work in schools.) i&#039;d like to go back to babysitting because i&#039;m no longer happy with the company i work for. it&#039;s a sad thing to see education be treated as a business. i&#039;d like to babysit full-time sometime after the new year. i&#039;m a very flexible person and i&#039;d be available from 7am-6pm but would like to work no longer than 40hrs a week. i know not many families can afford a full-time babysitter so i&#039;d even do part-time days or hours as well. i used to babysit for a family for 2 years when their child was only 6wks old and it was a wonderful experience. because i started off as a floater, i&#039;m comfortable with all age groups. the age group i worked with most were the infants and the 2yr olds. i have experience in potty training, consistency is the key! and will respect all your wishes for your children in terms of such rules like no television or special dietary needs. i live close to the broadway/steinway area and am willing to travel to other sides of astoria that are within 20min walking distance. (i do not drive!) i&#039;d love to hear from you if you&#039;re interested so please send me a private message so that we can exchange emails! oh, and since the new years is so close, yet so far.. i&#039;d even offer myself as a weekend babysitter to watch your child while you enjoy a friday or saturday night out. i figure that&#039;s also a good way to get to know each other.<br /><br />thanks! :)<br />have a lovely weekend.
