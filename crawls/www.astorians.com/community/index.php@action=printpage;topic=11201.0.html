				I am thinking of looking for a mother&#039;s helper...someone in junior high or high school who can help me take care of my almost 3 month daughter while I work on my dissertation.<br /><br />Has anyone ever done this? and what advice do you have, where did you find one and what kind of pay did you offer?

				The summer after my freshman year at college I worked as a mother&#039;s helper. The mom was always home with me, she just needed an extra pair of hands with the kids. They had just recently adopted a boy who was 1 years old when I came to work for them, and she had unexpectedly gotten pregnant with twins right after. So she had a 1 year old boy and 2 3-month old boys.<br /><br />This was in 2002, and they paid me $10 an hour. I worked 2 days a week, from 8am-4pm, and she always provided me with lunch. I basically helped her feed the babies, change diapers, change clothes, make their bottles, play with them and did the babies laundry only (not their housekeeping).<br /><br />I would say try to get a high school age student for this type of job, and pay at least $12 an hour. My mom found the ad in her church&#039;s bulletin actually. Maybe try craigslist, but I&#039;d stick with someone who&#039;s in the neighborhood if you can find someone.<br /><br />Hope this helps.

				Thanks for the advice. Why do you say 12$ an hour? i&#039;m just curious as a Nanny runs about 12 an hour from what i saw in listings in cobble hill. I really don&#039;t even need someone to do more than talk toher and keep her engaged while i&#039;m working on the computer. I&#039;m breastfeeding so feeding wouldn&#039;t even be part of the job. Thanks again for the feedback.

				$12 was just a guess on my part about what the going rate these days would be, totally up to you though.
