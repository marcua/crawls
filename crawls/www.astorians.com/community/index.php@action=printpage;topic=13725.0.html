				Has anyone seen the guys riding the ATV&#039;s in and around Astoria Park?&nbsp; <br /><br />Every time it snows someone is tearing about the park in their ATV&#039;s ripping up the park and causing trouble.&nbsp; They did it last year too and it left lasting marks in the lawn.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also seen them driving on the street, but can&#039;t figure out where they live.&nbsp; Anyone have an idea?

				a guy across the street from me drives his ATV up and down the block almost every night. drives me crazy, especially in the snow because he tears up and down and swerves everywhere...I&#039;m afraid he&#039;ll hit a parked car.&nbsp; then he sits with the motor running and talks (yells) to his buddys.&nbsp; I have a pretty high tolerance for noise (I live right next to the El), but this guy sucks.&nbsp; This is on 23rd road between 31st and 29th street.

				For the bike trails on L.I., you would call 911 then the P.O.P. Unit when you get home, providing as much detail as you can. <br /><br />Make a note of the day, date, time, and color of the ATV. What would help most is the license plate # of the transport vehicle (if they drove the ATVs to the park) or maybe even their address. Provide this all to the sargent and ask him to pay them a visit (if you have the address of course.)<br /><br />Around here, not exacty sure of the protocol. But ATVs are definitely not allowed so calling 911 would be in order.

				Just saw them in the park.&nbsp; There were 3 of them.&nbsp; 2 small quads and a bigger one with a roof.&nbsp; They were zooming around the great lawn towing kids on sleds - totally trashed the big lawn and left big gouges where the tires cut through the snow and ice.&nbsp; Add to that all the noise they make and nobody who lives on or near the park cares for these guys at all. <br /><br />They don&#039;t come on trailers - they&#039;re driving through the streets to get here and they don&#039;t have plates.&nbsp; Somebody in the park called 911 and told them - 911 could care less.&nbsp; A patrol car rolled by about 5 minutes after they left the park (probably a coincidence), but they didn&#039;t seem all that interested either.&nbsp; They took off down 23rd Rd towards 23rd St.<br /><br />What irks me the most is that I&#039;m an ATV owner - I have 2 upstate that I ride regularly.&nbsp; Their actions reflect poorly on all ATV riders and make it harder for us to find legal places to ride.<br /><br />If anyone has any more info, it would be greatly appreciated.

				ATVs do serious damage to the hard work we do on the bike trails out east, and they&#039;re forbidden in ALL city parks. <br /><br />Not only that, but they can be awfully confrontational. A couple of them showed up one day after a volunteer trail work party. When the president of our club (a pacifist and very thin vegan to boot) approached two of them on foot and told them they weren&#039;t allowed, they revved their engines and lunged as if threatening to run him over. He stood his ground (it was like Tiananmen Square!) and one of them sucker-punched him in the head, sending him to the ground. Of course they turned and took off after that.<br /><br />It&#039;s unbelivable. Our club president has devoted countless hours building/maintaining trails, educating people on proper etiquette (being polite, carrying trash out etc.), and how to make the trails sustainable so as to cause the least amount of erosion and plant damage. Meanwhile, the trails are routinely destroyed by motorcyclists cutting trees down and ATVs chewing up the soil. <br /><br />Zeke, it sucks that the jerks are spoiling everything for you, but do you have suggestions? Short of making them totally illegal, except for parks officials, EMTs etc? Because that seems like the only solution.<br /><br /><br />

				well,<br /><br />there is a guy who lives on 46th just below 31st avenue who rides his atv in the snow.<br /><br />Maybe next blizzard go watch that street and see if he heads for the park?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />He does come up and down 30th avenue on it in the really big storms.

				I saw these guys (I think) tearing around on 30th Ave during the first big snowfall. They were careening between cars and trucking between trucks. I was surprised no one was hurt.<br /><br />I&#039;ve seen guys unloading ATVs on Crescent St. between Hoyt South and Astoria Blvd, but I don&#039;t know if it was those guys or not.<br /><br />Either way, as a person who used to love and use ATVs appropriately and frequently, it&#039;s sad to see such a gross misuse of the vehicle.

				Score one for the good guys:<br /><br /><em>On January 15 at 10:00 a.m., P.E.P. Captain William Cardoza received a radio transmission from Mounted Auxiliary Sergeant Gabe Vazquez that he was holding an individual at the northeast side Van Courtland Park&#039;s parade grounds for illegal use of a motorized vehicle, a 2008 Honda ATV. <br /><br />Upon Captain Cardoza&#039;s arrival, the two officers ran the driver&#039;s plate and license through the Central communications division for any outstanding warrants, which was negative. The officers proceeded to issue a Criminal Court Summons for unlawful operation of motorized vehicle and the ATV was confiscated with a copy of a Parks voucher issued to the owner with his summons. <br /><br />The motorized vehicle was transported to the 50th Precinct for a police voucher, and then transported to the New York City Police Auto Pound in Queens. </em> <br /><br />&nbsp;:mrgreen:

				ATV&#039;s tear up the ground and cost the NY Parks Department thousands of dollars to repair in addition to the air and noise pollution.&nbsp; Also, operators of these vehicles are typically not licensed nor insured (liability), creating an additional danger for pedestrians and parked vehicles.&nbsp; If you see them, call 911 immediately.<br />

				Not when you consider the cost of ripping up the terrain. Hiking and biking are sustainable forms of recreation; ATVs and dirt bikes chew up the trails and require constant maintenance. <br /><br />Peds and bikes can squeeze through trees just a handlebar&#039;s width, but when motorized vehicles come along, they take down the trees to make the path wider, for example. <br /><br />ATVs aren&#039;t given the same access as hikers and mountain bikers because you can&#039;t stop them from abusing the priviledge. What PJ said, unfortunately, reflects the typical attitude of ATV owners: <em>&quot;what an amature, how do you get cought on that thing ?? alittle dip and dash and your gone!!!! im about to go to the pound and bid on that actually !!!!&quot; </em> They can&#039;t be caught b/c they outrun everybody. <br /><br />Meanwhile, bicyclists are constantly reminded of how careful they need to be. If you hit the trails with this kind of attitude, you risk losing your rights, it&#039;s that simple. So IMBA&#039;s mission is to teach all bikers how to build sustainable trails, how to ride with less impact, how to deal with non-bikers, etc. Our goal is to build and maintain trails with the least impact to nature as possible. <br /><br />Granted, there are the jerks who ruin it for everybody else, but even they can&#039;t damage the trail the way an ATV or dirt bike can. And EVERY ATV rider I&#039;ve come across riding illegally on our bike trails has flat-out ignored me when I reminded them they didn&#039;t belong there. Funny how you never see them out there early on a Saturday morning with shovels and Pulaskis, fixing erosion damage or re-routing a fall-line trail. <br /><br />Yeah I know I&#039;m getting preachy. But the green space we have on L.I. is not only limited in size, but fragile. Why ATVs aren&#039;t allowed in more places off-island, I don&#039;t know- probably b/c they have no reason to obey the rules, and there&#039;s no way to stop them from tearing up land wherever they want.
