				Hey all,<br /><br />What would be a reasonable rent increase for a significant other moving into your 1 bedroom apartment? <br /><br />My landlord and I have a fairly good relationship, he has met my boyfriend a number of times, and was cool with it when I broached the subject of him relocating to NY and moving in with me.<br /><br />My rent for a 1 bedroom in upper Ditmars is $1,075. Low I know, but the kitchen and bathroom ought to be gutted and I have a 15 minute walk to the subway. He had just raised my rent from $1,000 to $1,075 in January - fair. <br /><br />He just surprised me by saying he will raise the rent from $1,075 to $1,500 once my boyfriend moves in. I was shocked. That&#039;s a 30% increase because another person is using your water? I pay electricity and gas too.<br /><br />Any insight would be appreciated, but I was thinking more along the lines of a $100 increase after asking around.<br /><br />Thanks for your time.<br /><br />Emily<br />

				Although there&#039;s probably not much you can do since it&#039;s likely a private residence, you can try calling Astoria&#039;s Housing Advisor:&nbsp; http://centralastoria.org/housing-advisor&nbsp;

				Truth is he has an asset and wants to get what it&#039;s worth. $1075 is really low, $1500 might be a bit on the higher side if you are saying it&#039;s really dumpy looking. Try to negotiate with him and see what he says. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s related to your boyfriend, I think he might just be trying to get what the apartment is worth, or he believes it to be worth

				<span style="font-family: verdana;" class="bbc_font"><span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">@ATB24 -- I think it&#039;s very likely related to her boyfriend moving in.<br /><br />Emily&#039;s landlord knows that the condition of the apartment, which is reflected in the discounted rent. He leased the apartment to a single person on a single income. I’m sorry but two people with two incomes is another story. It’s not only water, it’s heat and now he has to deal with two people, not one.<br /><br />The game has changed. Though I think a 30% jump is unreasonable, I don’t think an extra $100 is enough either, so that&#039;s why I suggested meeting in the middle somewhere. In the end though, it comes down to what the apartment is really worth and can Emily get a 1-bedroom apartment with a kitchen and bathroom in better condition closer to the subway for less than $1,500? <br /><br />I know all landlords are supposed to be evil (and many are) but if I may offer another perspective:<br /><br />You and a friend share an apartment. Your friend makes less money than you do and has taken the smaller room so you decide to pay a higher share of the rent and utilities, but you don’t mind because she is your friend. <br /><br />Next month her boyfriend, who you like and stays over occasionally, will move in permanently. To compensate she offers to pay an extra $100, which means you are now splitting the rent 50%-50%. Would you settle for this? I have a feeling you would not.<br /></span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: verdana;" class="bbc_font"><span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">Emily: Good luck.

				Hi Yaxpac, I see what you are saying, but though it wasn&#039;t stated, what if the landlord lived in the property? My point is that an arrangement made under one set of circumstances, may not be as agreeable when those circumstances change.&nbsp; I agree with you that she should talk to the LL and work it out.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I was once in the same position as EmilyB. I lived on the top floor of a private house that was divided into two apartments. Another tenant lived downstairs. The landlord lived a few houses down the street and was a lovely person and very reasonable. <br /><br /><br />The apartment was in decent shape, not the best but not the worst I lived in, but the rent was very, very cheap and part of the &#039;unwritten&#039; deal was in exchange for a low rate, the understanding would be that I would live there alone, I wouldn&#039;t be a nuisance to the neighbors and I wouldn&#039;t be a nuisance to the landlord. He would take care of the big things that could go wrong and I wouldn&#039;t bother him every five minutes to fix the little things. It was an arrangement we both lived by and were happy with.<br /><br /><br />A couple of years later, when my partner moved in, my landlord was still a lovely person, but he was less happy about the thought of renting to two people and what that may entail. He made the deal with me, not me and my partner. <br /><br /><br />So he felt an increase was in order and it was less about the money and more about he thought his aggravation level would increase and that he didn&#039;t want to seem to be taken advantage of.<br /><br /><br />At first, I felt the same as EmilyB, but then I realised, I changed the deal with him, he didn&#039;t change the deal with me, so we met somewhere in the middle and that was that. When I moved out at the end of my lease he wanted me to stay and hoped that the increase didn&#039;t make me leave.<br /><br /><br />Just offering another perspective. The only people who know the reality are EmilyB and her landlord and we only have Emily&#039;s side of the story. The rest is conjecture on my part. To me the rationale for the increase is that two people will be living in the property instead of one but it could very well be something altogether different.

				Is this a Rent Stabilized apartment?<br /><br />If it is, the addition of your boyfriend to the lease is a change of tenancy as far as the statute is concerned.&nbsp; Accordingly, your landlord is entitled to increase the rent by the maximum amount permitted by Rent Guidelines Board.<br /><br />If this is NOT a Rent Stabilized apartment, your landlord can raise the price however much he wants.&nbsp; That is the downside of asking him to put your boyfriend ON your lease.&nbsp; <br /><br />Alternatively (and regardless of whether the apartment is or is not Rent Stabilized), you can have your boyfriend move in and not put him on the lease.&nbsp; Under those circumstances, there is nothing the landlord can do.<br /><br />Google: &quot;New York City Roommate Law&quot; for more information.&nbsp; You can also read this: http://www.nycrgb.org/html/guide/basics.html#Roommates (http://www.nycrgb.org/html/guide/basics.html#Roommates)<br /><br />Finally, if you go with the Roommate Law option, at least you know what to expect when he renews your lease the next time.&nbsp; That should give you ample time to look for a new place.

				Another perspective from a landlord who also spent many years as a tenant....<br /><br /><br />We have a small apartment on the top floor of our house. Their kitchen and entryway are over our bedroom. We have rented to many different configurations of people, and there is definitely an impact on our quality of life when there are two people living there as opposed to one. In a situation like this, I think a difference in rent based on the number of people occupying the space is perfectly understandable.<br /><br /><br />But yeah, if you&#039;ve got a reasonable relationship I&#039;d definitely make a counter-offer. And perhaps ask if the landlord has particular concerns about your bf moving in so that you can address those directly.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I know you said u pay your own gas&nbsp; but does also include gas heat ?&nbsp; &nbsp; And for whoever said&nbsp; having two people live there instead of one , doesn&#039;t affect the landlord , they either aren&#039;t thinking clearly&nbsp; or have no idea&nbsp; what it is to be a landlord .&nbsp; &nbsp;More people means more&nbsp; noise , more foot traffic&nbsp; &nbsp;more water being used .&nbsp; &nbsp; Either way you were getting a&nbsp; one bedroom for dirt cheap .&nbsp; You can t&nbsp; even get a&nbsp; studio in most places for under 1000 ,&nbsp; so consider yourself&nbsp; really lucky on that part .&nbsp; As far as your boyfriend moving in ,&nbsp; im sure the rent was raised cuz&nbsp; two people will be paying now instead of one plus the other factors I stated .&nbsp; If I rent to 2 roommates&nbsp; &nbsp;I can go&nbsp; to a certain number .&nbsp; If they bring a 3rd person , u know im raising the price no doubt .&nbsp; Ive rented a&nbsp; 3 bedroom to 4&nbsp; roommates before and it was 3000 dollars but being they all divided it plus the utilities ,&nbsp; they also got a&nbsp; good deal

				<br />Many assumptions here were made that Emily lives in the same building as her landlord.&nbsp; What if that wasn&#039;t the case?&nbsp; Does that change the price since there wouldn&#039;t like be a quality of living change for the landlord?&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />I moved to Astoria in 2008 and my landlord of course has tried to raise the rent on nearly every lease, but I&#039;ve been able to negotiate for less than what they have asked almost every time just by asking...no sob stories or anything.&nbsp; So definitely try to negotiate.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />As others have said, I do think an increase is reasonable and maybe more than $100 per month, but I don&#039;t know about $425 more a month.&nbsp; Shoot for maybe $1250 and see if that is fair.&nbsp;

				That is pretty much exactly what I said earlier. <br /><br />Thanos, my comment that it did not effect the landlords quality of life was based on my assumption that they did NOT live in the building.&nbsp; Clearly you assumed the opposite which seems unlikely to me bc of the conditions of the place.&nbsp; But I won&#039;t go blasting you as ignorant like you did to me.&nbsp; It&#039;s cool.&nbsp; &nbsp;:lipsrsealed:

				Everyone always seems to think they know the landlord is being unfair in almost any case presented on this board .&nbsp; But try to see it from their side as well .&nbsp; &nbsp;More foot traffic affects the landlord in many different ways .&nbsp; Its more noise&nbsp; , more wear and tear ,&nbsp; more water use&nbsp; and even if the landlord doesn&#039;t live there ,&nbsp; &nbsp;I know from experience , other tenants get bothered as well by more people living over them .&nbsp; &nbsp;When I rent out an apt to a single person its way easier then when they bring a roommate in or&nbsp; renting out to 2-3 people .&nbsp; &nbsp; Also I never said anyone was ignorant at all ,&nbsp; &nbsp;just that don&#039;t think if the landlord doesn&#039;t live there ,&nbsp; more people in an apt doesn&#039;t mean anything .&nbsp; &nbsp;My apts that have multiple tenants coming at different times at night means that front door is opening and closing a lot more .Different times more noise ,tenants get upset at this .&nbsp; Its just more there&nbsp; for things to happen .&nbsp; &nbsp;As far as the price , seems the OP was getting a steal for a long time .&nbsp; This landlord either got the news late&nbsp; or something cuz&nbsp; he is way underpricing his place and now either expects them to pay the new rent or leave .&nbsp; NO ONE will ever rent hike that much unless they don&#039;t care if u leave or not .

				Yes, an assumption was made that Emily lives in a non-stablized apartment, which most likely means a private 2-, 3-family house, because if the apartment fell within rent stabilization laws, the landlord would only be allowed to raise the rent according to set percentages each year and the lease would make any rent increases explicit.<br /><br />The scenario she described sounded like she lives in a house or small apartment building and it&#039;s not uncommon in these cases the landlord lives in the house or nearby, but of course this isn&#039;t always the case. Unless she checks in with a progress report we&#039;ll never know. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				Thanks for everyone&#039;s responses! To answer a few of your questions that I saw:<br />-it is not rent stabilized<br />-the landlord lives below me<br />-I pay cooking gas and electricity, he pays water and gas heat<br /><br />Without getting into too much detail, I found out that the tenant next door to me is a family friend of the landlord from way back. He just moved in in November. I put two and two together on that...<br /><br />I would&#039;ve been willing to negotiate, but he specifically said that if I&#039;m going to come back with $200 more, to forget it. Moreso, he doesn&#039;t keep up with the apartment. I&#039;ve told him about water damage in my bedroom, living room and bathroom after multiple storms, and he has yet to check it out. In fact, a large piece of ceiling is about to fall in my bathroom due to the absence of a fan or window. I just think he doesn&#039;t care.<br /><br />I am putting in my 30 day notice tomorrow. I found a place that was definitely worth the $1,500 going rate!<br /><br />Thanks for your help all.<br /><br />Emily

				The normal&nbsp; rent is already&nbsp; 1500 [ 1700 should be the &quot;new normal&quot;] for two or more people. Landlords don&#039;t want to invest &quot;extras&quot; because there is oversaturation of demand thus they eliminate the &quot;extra&quot; investments when their price projection is not meet. Unless you sign a new contract on 1500 range not many landlord will do a lot for that price you had.People think&nbsp; the fact they&nbsp; share a house with landlord&nbsp; and is not &quot;mint&quot;/ and landlords are less inclined to invest even necessities&nbsp; should reflect a lower price, which is not how the&nbsp; actual reality of real estate market is in Astoria or heading. Yours was pure luck that you&nbsp; found wait&nbsp; a year more.
