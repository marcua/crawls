				I believe that movers are required to put their state department of transportation license numbers on all of their advertisements.<br /><br />No license number = possibly no insurance and possibly a shady operation. These guys might be the greatest movers in the world but just be careful with any moving company fellow Astorians.<br />More info:<br />https://www.dot.ny.govisions/operating/osss/truck/moving (https://www.dot.ny.govisions/operating/osss/truck/moving)
