				Hi Im a CUNY student and I lived in Astoria for over 8 years. I am doing a project on our neighborhood and I was hoping people on this forum can help. I need to put together a brief history of Astoria ( economic, jobs, industry, immigration, etc) using community interviews. I think this is the best place to ask instead of the ditmars train station..lol<br /><br /><br />Do you know any urban planning of construction in Astoria that will have an impact with the neighborhood?<br />Notice any demographic, economy, job, social status, new construction changes in your history of living in Astoria?<br />Notice any changes that are important to you in your history of living in Astoria?<br /><br /><br />I am hoping to establish a pattern for my thesis, and this might be a great place to learn more about how Astoria evolved from stienway&#039;s factory town.<br />If I want to use your thoughts exactly on my project I will be pm&#039;ing you for credit and citation details.<br /><br /><br />Thanks

				My family is here long time. In 1950s to 1970s it was working class type area, but prior to that some parts were considered high tone.&nbsp; &nbsp;In mid-1980&#039;s it suddenly became predominately foreign speaking, in past 10 years, yuppies who don&#039;t want to admit they are yuppies so they call&nbsp; others&nbsp; that. <br /><br /><br />All In the Family the old tv show from 1970s , was supposed to be about Astoria, as was Bill Cosby&#039;s show in&nbsp; 1990s.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />Can you be a bit more specific for what you need, I don&#039;t mind, but don&#039;t fell like typing stuff you might not need.

				My family (Irish/German) escaped Manhattan in the late 1880&#039;s and moved to the &quot;county&quot; - Astoria.

				It was certainly a &quot;workers&quot; town. My cousin&#039;s grandfather bought his home in the ditmars area in 1977 for $47k, he was a busboy. Today you can&#039;t purchase anything unless you get a lot of family support or a couple is making 200k a year. So it is transitioning and catering more to &quot;yuppies&quot; as some other poster mentioned. The proximity to manhattan makes it desirable and I can&#039;t complain, the &quot;yuppies&quot; spend $$ in the area which is good for the community

				Astoria was first settled by Europeans ca. 1640s by Willian Hallet (Hallet&#039;s Cove), an Englishman who obtained a patent for the land in the vicinity of the cove.&nbsp; It was rural farmland for several generations.&nbsp; The Village of Astoria was established by Stephen Halsey in the early 19th Century.&nbsp; It was named after John Jacob Astor, the weathy fur trader and New York land owner who had a house across the river near where Gracie Mansion now stands.&nbsp; This was an attempt to get Astor to invest in the area; it was unsuccessful.&nbsp; After the Civil War, it became a fashionable area, with many mansions in the area of &quot;the hill&quot;, 27th Avenue, from the river up to 14th Street.&nbsp; Most of these were (disgracefully) torn down in the 1960s before any attempts were made to landmark the area of Old Astoria.&nbsp; The village itself was obliterated after World War II by the building of the Astoria Houses project.&nbsp; Steinway was a seperate village for the workers at the piano factory.&nbsp; Some of the houses till sdtand in the vicinity of 20th Avenue and Steinway Street.&nbsp; By far your best resource for research is the Greater Astoria Historical Society.&nbsp; Check out their website.

				My family bought our building in the early 1950&#039;s. My understanding was that it was an ethnically diverse area back then (Italians, Germans, Irish), but not to the extent that it is now. Working/middle class neighborhood of families.<br /><br />And JoeyC, the Cosby Show of the 90s? You mean with the Huxtables?

				My grandparents migrated from Italy to Astoria in the 1930&#039;s and my family has been here ever since. My Dad told stories of how people would try to escape the heat of summer nights by sleeping on the grass in Astoria Park.<br />I agree that the Greater Astoria Historical Society is the best place to truly learn Astoria&#039;s history (www.astorialic.org (http://www.astorialic.org)).&nbsp; They have many interesting facts about our neighborhood, such as the role the&nbsp; Hell Gate Bridge played during WWII.<br />You picked a great topic to write about!&nbsp; I wish you lots of luck

				Urban huh?&nbsp; You do need your timeline.&nbsp; Astoria, along with Ravenswood, Hunter&#039;s Point, Steinway, etc. were all included in the city of Long Island City, established in 1870.&nbsp; Steinway moved his factory from Manhattan to it&#039;s current location in the same year.&nbsp; L.I.C. remained a city until 1898, when it, and the rest of Queens County became part of the City of New York.&nbsp; L.I.C&#039;s most notable figure was Mayor Patrick &quot;Clubber&quot; Gleason...now that was a pol!

				Ms. Pineapple:<br />Chill out.&nbsp; The OP first implied that he/she was looking for historical background on Astoria.&nbsp; I gave OP a history, albeit truncated, of the area&#039;s beginnings.&nbsp; OP then said that the focus of the research is urban development.&nbsp; I explained the formation of Long Island City as a municipality&nbsp; and its&#039; eventual combination with the City of New York.&nbsp; I also offered what I think are two very interesting areas of research for a budding urbanologist:&nbsp; the obilteration of the location of the Village of Astoria with the building of the Astoria Houses, and the wanton destruction of Astoria&#039;s history in the demolition of &quot;the hill&quot; residences around 27th Avenue in the 70s and 80s.&nbsp; While I won&#039;t speak for him, I believe Astoristani was reminding the OP that academic research requires rigor, like spending a Saturday afternoon or two at the Greater Astoria Historical Society.&nbsp; I admire the OP for the initiative shown in posting on the site.&nbsp; It&#039;s a start.<br />&nbsp;

				Regarding what has changed most, I was born almost t30 years ago here, an biggest change is construction all over, leading to more crowding in already crowded area, and lack of any areas with some breathing room.&nbsp; Long Island City area by end of Vernon Blvd was place to go learn how to drive 10 years ago, now it is packed, they put up so many high rises.&nbsp; Upside is that mostly rich people moved in, so area improved in that sense.&nbsp; Many people have long considered community board and zoning committee&nbsp; crooked .&nbsp; &nbsp;They keep&nbsp; &nbsp;changing zoning laws to favor development, then tell us they are &#039;Enriching neighborhood&quot; and &#039;Helping economic development,&quot; two key secret codes for &#039;You are f$cked, and we don&#039;t care&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I was doing some research for my personal history while living in Astoria and ran across this web site, saw many remarks about the F.W. Woolworth store, and just had to chime in to those many friends who remembered the F.W.Woolworth store on 31st and Steinway Street. My father was the manager of that store in 1934 and 1935. We lived in an apartment on 38th street and I attended PS 6, 4th grade. Store managers were transferred every couple of years, just like the army, so we moved to MA in the summer of 1935. I do have many memories of Astoria but one of my fondest memories was of a man by the name of Rapaport (sp), who was supposed to have owned a night club in the city. I guess maybe today we might classify him as a &quot;gangster&quot; but in those days he was one of my fathers best friends and did many kind favors for my mother and father and that is how I remember him. It was a pleasure chatting with you. Best wished to all.<br />Chuck B.&nbsp;

I heard that the owner raised the rent so high that it wouldn&#039;t be feasible to put a business there. In addition, I&#039;ve heard the owner also gets a tax break every year that the property remains vacant. Now I&#039;m not saying that all of this is true - it&#039;s mainly heresay and I haven&#039;t checked into it, but it seems pretty strange to have a spot vacant for all this time in a prime shopping neighborhood.

				Chuck:<br />&nbsp;<br />Great post!&nbsp; I went to Immac in the early 60s.&nbsp; Every so often, my mother would meet at lunch time and take my sister and I to Woolworth&#039;s for lunch.&nbsp; We&#039;d sit at the counter and order something like a tuna sandwich from a waitress wearing a hair net.<br />I also remember walking around the store, and the worn but immaculate wooden floors.<br />&nbsp;<br />Thanks for the memories!

				I&#039;m sorry, Illegal Alien, that I can&#039;t remember more. Oh, speaking of IMMAC, you do remind me that Frankenstein and Dracula came out about that time, 1934/35, and my folks wouldn&#039;t let me go or take me (9 years old?). The theater was somewhere in the area, 28th Ave?, or somewhere near. Just to close the circle; we settled in Maine in the early 40&#039;s, I went into the service and when I got out I didn&#039;t want to stay in that &quot;hick&quot; state, Maine, so I took off for&nbsp; New York City in 1947, instead of going to college like I should have. Remembering Woolworth, and with my father&#039;s help, I got a job at good old FW, the Times Square store, but was called back when the Korean war started. No, I didn&#039;t return to Woolworth after I got out of the service the 2nd time but I did go to college. Thanks for bringing some of those great times back to me.<br />Kindest regards, Chuck B<br /><br />
