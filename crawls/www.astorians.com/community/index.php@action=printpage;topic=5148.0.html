				Along the lines of this topic (and I hope I&#39;m not getting off-topic), does anyone know how/where I can recycle used plastic shopping bags?&nbsp; Can they go out with the rest of the recycling?&nbsp; It&#39;s not like we have that many, but I&#39;d like to recycle what we do have rather than throw them out with the trash.

				I don&#39;t think you can recycle them, though I could be wrong. <br /><br />I reuse mine to line wastebins. <br /><br />Cabanird once crocheted a tote bag out of them. <br /><br />The other thing is to take a backpack when you do your grocery shopping and ask them not to bag anything except meat. <br /><br />

				oh yeah, I&#39;m all about the plastic-bag reuse! I try to keep one in my purse and use what we have stored at home for the small wastebaskets. When I go for a lot of grocery shopping, I bring the &quot;granny bag&quot; (you know, the plastic thing that fits in the granny cart.) I&#39;m amazed how much you can cram in there!! It&#39;s like a clown car, honestly. <br /><br />Don&#39;t forget to get a sturdy, cheap bike for around town and even commuting&nbsp; :wink:<br /><br />Other than that, I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m not very &quot;green&quot; at all. Getting any kind of food delivered or take-out, especially Chinese food for some reason- it&#39;s an enormous amount of garbage. Ditto my coffee everyday- the thought of keeping a mug at work skeeves me out (hard to wash properly in a public bathroom facility.)<br /><br />Organic food is expensive, so I have to pick and choose which ones to go with. But I rarely eat meat so that helps cut back on the pollution and waste of slaughterhouses.<br /><br />It&#39;s not easy being green&nbsp; :roll:

				Bah - I beg to differ. To start with - by living in NYC one is already MUCH more efficient than the average suburbanite. If you don&#39;t drive everywhere, you&#39;re also already winning. If you dont&#39; drive at all, or use a car, except for the occasional taxi, so much the better. Some other basic things you can do:<br /><br />- Buy compact flourescent lighbulbs for your lights. This is simple, will save you money, and cut down your energy useage HUGELY. Importantly, as a chick living on her own, for me this also means changing lightbulbs NEVER as these things last for 9 YEARS! Seriously. Home Depot had 6 for something like &lt;$10 when I got mine in September - I did the whole apartment for less than $30, and its awesome!! <br /><br />- Try to cut down on plastic bag usage, as you mention. Use a backpack, get things delivered in boxes, refuse bags when you can. Reuse as much as possible, recycle in normal recycling - so far they&#39;ve taken mine just fine. <br /><br />- Buy locally produced food. Home delivered grocery shopping cuts down on greenhouse emissions hugely, when compared to everyone driving individually to the supermarket. However, buying locally produced food, providing one buys in season, also reduces the amount of greenouse gases used to produce said food. This requires some smart thinking - it has been shown that buying locally grown rice in California, for example, costs more in terms of greenhouse emissions than buying Bangladeshi grown rice in California would. Rember too that water is a precious resource. In a nutshell, eat seasonally and locally - this is why a CSA is such a good idea, provided the farmer isn&#39;t running greenhouses that are heated etc. Essentially, if you&#39;re eating a ripe tomato in New York in winter, you&#39;re doing the wrong thing, in this world view. Can your fruit, eat peaches and mangos that are preserved (in winter), use the old fashioned ways to get around the cold - forget expensive importing. <br /><br />- Use public transportation<br /><br />- If you own, move towards green roofs and solar heating<br /><br />- Even if you don&#39;t own, pressure your landlord for green roofs, and change your electricity supplier to ConEd Solutions, who do supply green energy (wind mostly) to NYC homes. <br /><br />- Do not buy factory farmed meat. Avoid non-organic produce of any kind where possible. All these types of agriculture are harmful to the environment and require socio-economic practices that are also questionable. Never eat non-free range eggs, chickens or pork. Always aim for grass- fed beef.<br /><br />I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll think of more. But those are simple things I&#39;m doing that I think are easy to incorporate into everyone&#39;s lives. Sure, there are days/months one cant&#39; afford organic everything, but whatever effort you do make, makes at least that little bit of difference. Something is always better than nothing!

				Also buy for the longterm.<br /><br />This is lesson I&#39;m working on learning as short term solutions are so appealing -- but when you are buying &quot;disposable consumer goods&quot; (my words) like electronics, clothes, housewears -- buy quality items that will last multiple seasons/years.&nbsp; Buying good quality increases the life of the product and means less waste.<br /><br />And if you buy it -- use it.&nbsp; Eat your veggies rather than letting them rot in the fridge (I know I&#39;m guilty).<br /><br />*Know* where it comes from.&nbsp; Clothes, consumer goods, food.&nbsp; Think about the materials, the craftsmanship, the pesticides and make an educated buying decision.<br /><br />Compost!&nbsp; I don&#39;t yet know how indoors but it&#39;s on my project list.<br /><br />Turn things off.&nbsp; Lights, fans, cable boxes.&nbsp; Find &quot;wall warts&quot; (chargers plugged into the wall drawing power after item is charged) and unplug them.<br /><br />Eat at home.&nbsp; Or if you&#39;re not eating at home, reject the wrappings.&nbsp; NYC loves the packaging.&nbsp; A coffee (or a bagel) with a wad of napkins in a paper bag every morning is a little excessive.&nbsp; Just say &quot;no bag please&quot;.<br /><br />Wash and properly sort your recycling.<br /><br />

				Can I ask a question about these flourescent light bulbs?&nbsp; Do they blink and flash like the ones in office buildings do?&nbsp; I&#39;m an artist and most of the time we shut these lights off, and either work in the dark or with a regular lamp, because of the kind of light they emit.&nbsp; The constant blinking which you can&#39;t normally detect but your eye does, in addition to the constant blinking of the computer, messes with your eye - which is a big reason <span class="bbc_u">you</span> don&#39;t blink as much when you&#39;re on the computer and why you end up with dry red eyes.&nbsp; The lights also isn&#39;t great for judging artwork color by.&nbsp; And it&#39;s so harsh too.&nbsp; And your skin looks so bad in that kind of light.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-P<br /><br />Have they started making flourescent bulbs that are more like sunlight?&nbsp; That would be much better.

				Over time I have gotten a lot more involved and interested in green living so this is a really great topic IMHO.<br /><br />We got a compost bin nearly a year ago and have been composting ever since. It is really great because we&#39;re able to turn around and use it in our garden, which means healthier and more diverse soil and less waste overall.<br /><br />Yes - you read that right - we have a garden. I&#39;ll call it an urban garden. We do container gardening since we don&#39;t have any sort of dirt other than store-bought and homemade. We try to grow our own tomatoes to save money (and food miles) over the summer. Tomatoes are almost always the most expensive thing that we buy, and additionally it is very likely that they are not grown near NYC, so this is a great one. We also try to grow other things like herbs. We love doing it, so it is rewarding in so many different ways.<br /><br />I try to buy most of my clothes at the thrift store. As a general rule I hate paying full price for something when in a regular store, so this is even better. I have gotten a lot of good quality clothes, too, (my best jeans come from the thrift store) and I usually leave the store having only spent $20 or $30 for clothes that would have originally amounted to more than $100 - $200. Additionally, I turn around and donate clothes to the thrift store. I think it is a great way to save on material waste. There are some things that I have a hard time buying at thrift stores - underwear and shoes. I will pay full price for a good pair of shoes, and I&#39;m happy to buy underwear on sale as long as it didn&#39;t have a previous owner.<br /><br />I do generally try to get a lot of organic food products, but don&#39;t always. One thing I struggle with in my own mind is the &quot;organic but not sustainable&quot; thing. There are some really great organic products that are from California, for instance, yet the amount of pollution it took for those products to get to NYC kind of cancels out the organic benefit. It is rather ironic that a product that wasn&#39;t made with pesticides harms the environment anyway just because of the vast amount of distance it travels. This is one reason why I love CSAs - you&#39;re supporting food that was grown near you. Great benefit to the farm(er), great benefit to you (organic/local), and great benefit to the environment (CO2 emissions are much lower).<br /><br />Great thread! :mrgreen: It&#39;s giving me extra ideas!

				We do a couple of things that are probably as good for the environment as for saving money:<br /><br />Instead of using paper towels, we bought a whole bunch of white cloth dishtowels and use those for clean-up instead.&nbsp; Every other week or so, we wash a load of them with bleach.<br /><br />I have a reusable cloth sack for carrying my lunch from home.&nbsp; I wrap my sandwich in foil and recycle after several uses.&nbsp; In general, we try to recycle and re-use as much as we can.&nbsp; I refill my water bottle and recycle only after it gets too gross to continue to use.&nbsp; Old clothes get used for workout gear, rags, etc. if too ratty to be donated to the Salvation Army.&nbsp; Old toothbrushes and sponges are saved for cleaning.<br /><br />We buy large size containers of cooking oil, dishwashing liquid and laundry detergent and refill smaller, easier to handle containers.&nbsp; All cleaning solvents are biodegradable and organic.<br /><br />I&#39;d love to get into the habit of turning off power strips when leaving the apartment, but it seems like too much of a hassle.&nbsp; I have a friend who does that, though, and she saved big-time on her electricity bill.<br /><br />daisy, we use energy-saving lightbulbs that work just fine and don&#39;t flicker - I don&#39;t know what brand they are, but they come in a coiled shape.<br /><br />What I&#39;d love to know is what to do with vegetable waste (we eat veg at home) if we don&#39;t compost or garden.&nbsp; Any ideas?

				Wow, there are so many great ideas here. <br /><br />The &quot;no shopping&quot; compact I am participating in this year is helping me really be more thoughtful about what I buy. (I have one shopping day a month where I can shop in places other than thrift stores). I&#39;m amazed at how little I miss shopping - it may be harder when spring arrives. I do occasionally catch myself oggling some awesome boots on my way to work, but I have not succumbed. <br /><br />Something else I am interested in is sharing resources. Instead of everyone buying a lawnmower, maybe sharing a lawnmower with your neighbors. Of course, none of us have lawnmowers, but it&#39;s a thought.

				Hi all-<br />I love this topic and wanted to contribute something I&#39;m doing to compost houshold waste---vermicomposting.&nbsp; Basically, I use red wiggler worms in a container, along with newspaper/grass clippings/paper towels or plant matter as bedding, and add my vegetable wastes.&nbsp; The worms will eat their weight in scraps every 2 days and their castings...erm...waste product, is an amazing black compost suitable for house or outdoor plants.&nbsp; It sounds a little wacky I know, but the worm bin can be hidden under a sink and, if done correctly, produces no smell or tellttale odors.&nbsp; <br /><br />Here&#39;s a great website about how to get started [http://www.nyccompost.org/how/wormbin.html].<br /><br />Also, in season, meaning when it&#39;s not too cold outside for them to bring the worms to Union Square,&nbsp; there is an organization in NYC that will sell you the worms you&#39;ll need.&nbsp; They set up a booth there and have lots of information available.<br /><br />Lower East Side Ecology Center<br />P.O.

				Reusable containers - was reminded that lately I&#39;ve been saving our glass containers (vegenaise jars, artichoke heart jars, salsa jars, etc.) and using them for dry food items. Great way to store things, plus not throwing all the glass items away in the recycling bin.<br /><br />Hmmm... I also have been trying to get away from using plastic sandwich bags quite so much when preparing my lunches. Am now trying to use our tupperware for nearly everything I take.<br /><br />Another thing is that I have been buying castile soap (http://www.drbronner.com/index.html) for my body wash which is a lot better for the environment. It is expensive but if you dilute it it can go a long way. I&#39;m also reusing old body wash bottles when I&#39;m diluting.<br /><br />For work - I have my own mug instead of using the paper cups. It&#39;s amazing how much paper waste offices go through!<br /><br />If I think of more things I&#39;ll add them. :)

				Daisy - I have had one problem only with my CFLs, which was that my loungeroom has this weird lighting set up where 6 bulbs are needed. When all 6 were CFLS, I got buzzing and some of the blinking you describe. I replaced a single one with an incandescent, and the problem disappeared. I think its just shonky wiring, which I can&#39;t do much about but its a bizarre problem, considering the much lower CFL wattage. Still, a single incandescent won&#39;t hurt. Similarly, my bedroom light fitting has trouble (alarming popping noises) with all three spots taken by CFLs - here I solved it by just using only two - I don&#39;t need that much light in the bedroom! I think CFLs have come a really long way in the past few years. The type I got are &#39;soft white&#39; which are wonderful, and have none of the &#39;harsh&#39; light that people have complained about tube flourescents for. My mother is one of the haters, but when she came to stay, became a total convert to the new bulbs. I&#39;ve also heard people say that a good way to solve the light quality thing is to put them behind slightly yellow shades or glass - while I&#39;m not sure this is necessary with the new ones, many of mine are behind that type of glass - in the kitchen and hallway particuarly, and if you&#39;re sensitive, it might be a good solution. Oh, you can&#39;t &#39;dim&#39; them - but I really don&#39;t mind that! <br /><br />Leezichka - thank you so much! I was just about to ask about worm farms here! <br /><br />Another good idea for vegie scraps, prior to their placement in a worm farm, is to put the scraps in a container and freeze. Once you have two large containers (I use the gladware ones), put them in a pot, cover with water, bring to boil, then simmer for a couple hours. Strain, reserve liquid, and freeze - you now have home-made vegie stock, for use in risottos, soups, etc. Saves you buying stock and gets the most out of your vegies. <br /><br />I also love the Thrift store shopping ideas, but am terrible at ever finding anything I like at these places, or even finding good thrift stores at all. Does anyone have recommendations for places to go?? <br /><br />I know someone mentioned a community garden in Astoria a while back, but when I went to check it out I was very disappointed. It&#39;d be nice to have a community vegetable-growing garden, which could use donated compost.

				If you&#39;re talking about ARROW, i think they do grow veggies. I shared a plot there a couple of years ago, and we grew radishes and spinach. <br /><br />As far as thrift stores, I have had good luck with the store on 30th Avenue across from Trade Fair (near the subway). Unfortunately they have no dressing rooms, but I&#39;ve had some great finds there. There&#39;s also a good place on Ditmars -&nbsp; a few blocks toward Steinway from 31st, don&#39;t remember the cross streets. <br /><br />I also like Jayme&#39;s idea of buying things that will last and are responsibly produced, even if you buy them new.

				That was what I meant - perhaps I got it wrong, but I cycled down to check it out, and it seemed to be a mostly paved area for kids to play in with just an itty bitty strip of sad looking plants. Did I go to the wrong place? <br /><br />

				Nope, that&#39;s it. I know what you mean, though. I had the same initial impression when I first saw it.<br /><br />I found out later that ARROW made the decision to convert part of their garden space into a play area because they felt it the playground was a very important contribution to the community - and everytime you go there you see kids playing, so I guess it is. <br /><br />The plots are small but you can still get a lot of veggies in there. If you are interested, I think I still have the contact information. <br /><br />If I had access to a rooftop I would be interested in container gardening like wasabisam mentioned.

				Ah there&#39;s another question I have - rooftop access in my building is super-easy, its a large flat space, it has an edge on it that&#39;s about my chest height, so um - 4 feet? The only break in this barrier is for a fire escape ladder at the back, although I think it varies in height somewhat. There&#39;s no real lock on the access door, just a kind of hook. When I first went up there, a couple summers ago (and left an incriminating trail of bottletops back to my door, cos I had a few too many), my old crazy greek landlady told me it was illegal to go up there and I wasn&#39;t allowed. When the new company took over, and a much nicer landlord came in, he told me we couldn&#39;t use it because it did not have a high enough barrier surrounding it and they were liable should a child or someone go up there and then fall off. This strikes me as nonsense for two reasons: 1) the barrier is 4 foot! it seems high enough to me! 2) there&#39;s no serious lock on that door. How on earth does a couple of plant pots make it more likely a child will go careening off the roof?? It is, incidentally, 6-unit building, with no children. <br /><br />Is there any way to resolve this? I like my landlord and don&#39;t want to be nasty, but also really, really want a garden/outdoor space.

				are any other tenants interested in a rooftop gardening space? maybe you could approach him together.<br /><br />If he is concerned about a lawsuit, I wonder if some kind of signed waiver absolving him of any responsibility in the event of an accident would address his concerns?

				Personal Kyoto is cool!&nbsp; I remember first hearing about it and thinking it was a great idea.<br /><br />Also remember there are turbines in the East River (http://astorianyc.blogspot.com/2007/02/turbines-in-east-river.html), a project to create hydro-electric power.&nbsp; I understand that if and when this project is fully installed, you&#39;ll be able to request energy from this source.&nbsp; A green power plant (http://www.astorians.com/index.php?topic=4934.msg54527#msg54527) is going up on Randall&#39;s Island, too.<br /><br />I would like to see a 5 cent discount with each reusable bag you bring to the grocery store.&nbsp; That&#39;s been a standard in the Bay Area for years and remember being surprised when I didn&#39;t get the 5 cents off when I brought my bags in to the supermarket when I moved to NY.&nbsp; Did you know that in 2002, Ireland put a 15 cent levy on plastic bags, resulting in a 95% decrease in their use?&nbsp; Impressive.&nbsp; A few other stats (I get a green email in my box each day):<br /><br />--Save oil and/or trees. In the US, about 12 million barrels of oil and 14 million trees go to producing plastic and paper bags each year.<br /><br />--Reusing makes cents. Stores like Albertsons and Wild Oats offer a 5-penny discount if you bring your own. <em>[yeah!]</em><br /><br />--Make sure plastic bags don&#39;t harm sea creatures. They&#39;re one of the 12 most commonly found items in coastal cleanups. <em>[both years I&#39;ve done the shoreline cleanup in Astoria Park, lots and lots of plastic bags show up.]</em>

				Great topic everyone!&nbsp; I have been interested in greener living every since I started reading &quot;An Inconvenient Truth&quot; several months ago.&nbsp; Needless to say, I only got to page three before I was so freaked out that I replaced all the lightbulbs in our house with CFL&#39;s.<br /><br />Just a few comments.<br /><br />Daisy - for CFL&#39;s I highly recommend the website www.efi.org.&nbsp; I bought a 3-way CFL three for our living room and find that it is so bright that we leave it on the lowest setting (the equivalent of 13 watts of energy).&nbsp; I noticed just now that they also have daylight bulbs which may help in your situation.&nbsp; For the other rooms of the house we got some from Home Depot that were 4 bulbs for $10.&nbsp; Lastly, they have nightlights that are really swell for those times you get up in the middle of the night and don&#39;t want to turn on a bunch of lights and waste the energy.&nbsp; We got one with a photocell that is pretty soothing to look at as it slowly changes colours.<br /><br />Jayme - for TV&#39;s I recently got a Sharp Aquos LCD that is approved (or certified, however you say it) by Energy Star.&nbsp; I did a ton of research and supposedly it uses a lot less energy when in standby mode so this might be something for people to consider.&nbsp; Plus, it uses a ton less energy than a Plasma screen and doesn&#39;t generate nearly that much heat.<br /><br />Enigmacat - I love that you started this thread and also the idea for a fire escape garden.&nbsp; I don&#39;t know if the rules have changed but when I looked into doing this several years ago (when I had a fire escape) I was told by the City that you can&#39;t have plants on fire escapes as it blocks them in case of an emergency.&nbsp; If you find out that this has changed or anything about how to have flower boxes (the regulations, etc) I&#39;d love to know as I&#39;d like to put in a couple in our kitchen.<br /><br />It&#39;s so refreshing to see such like minded people in this community.&nbsp; Reaffirms for the gazillionth time why I have enjoyed living in Astoria for the past 10 years!

				One last thing...<br /><br />The other night on the N we saw a guy with bags from a fairly new place called &quot;Really Cool Foods.&quot;&nbsp; I checked it out last night and they have all organic/antibiotic free foods.&nbsp; Some are prepared or you can buy ingredients to make your own recipes.&nbsp; Naturally, it&#39;s a little more expensive than you would find in Key Food given that it&#39;s organic but I thought they had a nice selection.<br /><br />Even though it&#39;s not in Astoria, it&#39;s less than two blocks from the Third Avenue Entrance at 60th Street (the store is between 62nd/63rd on the East side of the street) and is definitely worth checking out.&nbsp; From what I can tell everything comes from Syosset so it helps to support the local people until the CSA picks back up.

				We got rid of our TV about a year ago maybe (?) and it was Jayme-inspired I have to say. :) We really don&#39;t miss it, although I had a really hard time giving in to the idea of losing it. Like Jayme, we do watch things on the Internet. We have a subscription to CNN Pipeline for news, and we watch YouTube and the like for clips and whatnot. We also are members of Peerflix so we watch movies on occasion. I&#39;d say that the most that I typically watch on the Internet amounts to about half an hour a day, sometimes less, sometimes more.<br /><br />It really does make a difference to not have a TV. When I&#39;m in a place where I can watch TV (hotels or other people&#39;s houses) I find that I can&#39;t watch for very long. When we were at my mom&#39;s for Christmas I&#39;d watch for a bit and then just turn it off, whereas before it would just stay on whether I was watching or not. <br /><br />We&#39;re also quite busy now that we don&#39;t have a TV. You wind up &quot;getting around to&quot; lots of things as well as taking on new and interesting projects - like gardening and composting and recycling and shopping at thrift stores and and and....&nbsp; :-D

				We signed up for Green Power for our apartment. It&#039;s easy to do and costs only an additional $10 per month. I love knowing that we&#039;re cutting down on fossil fuel in the energy grid. The place we signed up through is Sterling Planet.<br /><br />Another thing we did that&#039;s easy and inexpensive, we changed our lightbulbs to CFLs. We ordered Warm White bulbs, that put out light similar to a regular bulb. They&#039;re not blueish, like industrial flourescent bulbs. It&#039;s cut our power bill down about $5 per month. If you get 75 watt (not sure what the CFL wattage equivilant is, something like 10 or 15) it&#039;s equal to the light coming out of a regular bulb. 100 watt CFL equivilant would be pretty darn bright, if you need more light for certain areas of your house.<br /><br />As for reuseable shopping bags, if you can get some canvas book bags, or a large backpack, you can cram a lot of stuff in there. I&#039;ve got 2 mesh bags that I&#039;ve used for years. We just keep it by the front door, so when we&#039;re going out to the store, we just grab one or two. You gotta be quick at the store though, they&#039;ll double bag a bag of Tostitos before you know it. It&#039;s kept our plastic bag consumption down to a minimum.

				From one of the email newsletters I receive regularly:<br /><br /><strong>TIP OF THE WEEK:<br />ENDING BOTTLED WATER ADDICTION WILL SAVE MONEY &amp; ENVIRONMENT</strong><br /><br />BOTTLED WATER ISN&#039;T NECESSARILY CLEANER: According to the San Francisco Chronicle and lawsuits from the Environmental Law Foundation, 40% of bottled water is really just repackaged tap water. Maybe that&#039;s a good thing, considering federal standards for tap water are actually higher than those for bottled water.<br /><br />BOTTLED WATER AND OIL: Supplying Americans with plastic water bottles for one year consumes more than 47 million gallons of oil, according to the Container Recycling Institute. That&#039;s enough to take 100,000 cars off the road and 1 billion pounds of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. Add in the additional amount of oil it takes to ship the bottles thousands of miles from extraction source to recipient, and your drink of H2O could be categorized with the &quot;Hummers&quot; of the world.<br /><br />BOTTLED WATER AND BIODEGRADABILITY: Buddha&#039;s bones turned to dust a long time ago. But if he had been a bottled water drinker, that plastic would still be laying around. It takes two minutes to drink a bottle of water, but it takes thousands of years for that piece of plastic garbage to go away.<br /><br />SOLUTION: Buy a water filter and a non-plastic water container of your preferred size. Fill it up in the morning before you go to work or school. Do a quick online search, and you can also find affordable portable water filters for when you are traveling. You&#039;ll save yourself and the environment a lot of expense.

				Cjford - I know what you&#039;re talking about as I remember them too - and went looking a few months ago for one for the same reason. No luck. If you have any, do let me know. I&#039;ve made do with a home water filter (its not that I don&#039;t trust NY tap water, which is some of the best in the world, but I don&#039;t trust the pipes in my building) and a Sigg aluminum lined bottle, which is super-lightweight, holds a fair bit, and I don&#039;t stress about plastic compounds making it into my water via the bottles (another possible problem with disposable plastic bottles and perhaps even Nalgenes). <br /><br />

				GRowing up, I remember my grandfather obsessed with lights being turned on and off. He claimed that you are better off leaving the lights on for a longer period of time rather than turning it on and off every time you enter a room, that more energy is used to turn the light on than you would use if you just left it on. He was more concerned with the money spent than energy conservation but I wasn&#039;t able to find information if this was valid or not....anyone know?<br />

				The magic of google offers this:<br /><br />http://hes.lbl.gov/hes/myths.html<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Leaving lights, computers, and other appliances on uses less energy than turning them off and makes them last longer.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The small surge of power created when some devices are turned on is vastly smaller than the energy used by running the device when it&#039;s not needed. While it used to be the case that cycling appliances and lighting on and off drastically reduced their useful lifetimes, these problems have been largely overcome through better design.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So he could have been right then but wrong now.<br /><br />Modified to include this as well -- math on old school flourescents:<br /><br />http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0NTQ/is_2005_August_3/ai_n14922456<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Leaving lights on all the time uses less energy than turning them on and off when they&#039;re used. Not true. Both incandescents and fluorescents use more energy left on all the time than they do turned on and off as needed. Some argue this can&#039;t be true, at least for fluorescents, because they draw an initial current five times greater than the operating current. But the starting surge of a rapid-start lamp lasts only 1/120th of a second. If you turn the lamp off for only a few seconds you&#039;ll still save more energy that it takes to start the lamp again. An energy study by the University of Oregon says that many people developed the habit of leaving lights on when fluorescents first came into use in the 1950s. But modern fluorescents are more durable and efficient than they were then, and save energy long term even though on-off cycling does take a toll. It seems unlikely, but here&#039;s the math. A standard rapid-start fluorescent left on all the time burns for 38,000 hours or about 4.3 years. Limited by on-off switching to 12 hours a day it will burn for only 30,000 hours. That makes switching seem counterproductive. But the lamp burning only 12 hours a day will remain in service for 6.8 years. So in this example you cut operating energy consumption in half and reduce lamp replacement costs by 30 percent. Without all the math, just bear in mind that turning off lights always saves energy. You&#039;ll save even more changing to compact fluorescents, which are three to four times more efficient than incandescents and last about ten times as long.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				This is in response to a question on the CFL lights. They don&#039;t blink, but they do provide that flourescent-stlye lighting. LCDs are another option, and I think better from what I hear, but they are quite expensive.<br /><br />Also there&#039;s a book, &quot;The Big Green Apple&quot; on living sustainably in NYC, and I would also recommend Better Basics for the Home, which tells you how to make your own non-toxic and eco-friendly house products. In fact, I may start a group in Astoria to make these products together once a month if anyone&#039;s interested.

				I like it pretty well. Some vegetables I could do without (just based upon taste, not quality or anything), but overall it is pretty good. We get a good selection for the price. Over the last couple of seasons it has been about $10/week for something like five different items including vegetables, fruits (mainly strawberries when they have been in season), and herbs (this is been the price for Hellgate CSA - other CSAs, like Astoria CSA, have different prices).<br /><br />My main satisfaction with being part of a CSA is the fact that I get to support a local farm. That&#039;s the most important thing...the tastiness is just a bonus.<br /><br />Hope this helps a little bit - I&#039;m sure other previous members will have input as well.

				Great thread, excellent information.&nbsp; I&#039;d be really interested in making cleaning products, I have an 8 year old who might also be interested in helping out.&nbsp; <br /><br />I read a really interesting book called &quot;Not Buying It: My Year Without Shopping&quot; by Judith Levine who lives in Brooklyn.&nbsp; She did a fairly radical not buying thing for the sake of the book, but certainly an interesting read for anyone interested in withdrawing from mad (or even just habitual) consumerism.&nbsp; The amount of money she saved is truly inspiring.&nbsp; And the reassessment of &quot;necessity&quot; is probably something we could all benefit from periodically.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s a bit like tv, you think you&#039;ll miss it more than you actually do, once you get going, though there are times when it&#039;s really hard.&nbsp; I lived without tv for about 10 years and now I find I miss not-tv.&nbsp; My family is adamantly opposed to chucking the thing, though we have only broadcast so that limits the stupidity.&nbsp; Plus saves loads of money.&nbsp; And I find I figure out much sooner that there&#039;s actually nothing to watch.<br /><br />I&#039;d love to switch to energy efficient light bulbs but I like the full spectrum light.&nbsp; Does anyone know if there is any such animal?&nbsp; And hopefully conservation can offset the higher cost of green/wind power. <br /><br />I read last week that SF has an ordinance to ban plastic bags altogether, although it would allow recyclable ones.&nbsp; Also the Container Store has a garbage pail with notches on the side to hold the handles of plastic shopping bags so I just use them for garbage bags, though I do try to use canvas, string and other conveyances as much as possible.&nbsp; <br /><br />As for the water issue, you can get a test kit for about $20 that will test what actually comes out of your tap for all kinds of things, and then you know.&nbsp; If you let tap water sit for about 24 hours the chlorine evaporates out of it.&nbsp; I suppose you could test it again and see what the difference is. I don&#039;t know how we all got sold on this idea of bottled water being so much better.&nbsp; In some places it&#039;s probably true, but not in NY.

				I appreciate your comments Arturo.&nbsp; I work for a NGO that developed one of the first Socially Responsible Standards and the concept of Corporate Social Responsibility, we really do need the consumers to become more conscious about labor conditions.&nbsp; In Europe this movement is far ahead, but in the US people dont really think of it as much.&nbsp; Convenience through disposability also applies to labor, because cheap workforce is also seen as disposable when convenient, and people are paying lets say 100 for jeans that could have been sewn by children earning less that $5 a day, so now production is moving to China because the overabundance of cheap labor, but then leaving lets say factories in central america with no jobs now, no jobs and the histories of war then lead people to migrate to other countries to look for jobs, so they come to the US and take the jobs no american would want to do, and then it becomes the immigration problem and &quot;these illegals&quot; trying to take american jobs. This is all related and its important to step back and see the whole picture and how so many other areas are affected

				I think we&#039;re pretty much in agreement, Sambarella. My wife is a social worker and I hear about the labor/imigrant side of things on a daily basis. I also feel that human beings, i.e. &quot;labor,&quot; have probably always been seen by big business as a resource (like water or trees) or even as a commodity to be traded. Being in the line of work you are, I imagine you&#039;ve seen Stephanie Black&#039;s film, &quot;Life and Debt&quot; about Jamaica and the free trade zones. I was floored when the local workers complained about poor working conditions and low pay and then the manufacturers (which were producing Haynes underwear at the time) fired them all, locked them out and began importing workers from China. Because the manufacturers had free trade zone status (a requirement for Jamaica being granted an IMF loan) they could only stand at the barbed wire fences that surrounded the factories and watch as busload after busload of Chinese laborers poured in to take their jobs. I guarantee you that those Chinese people were NOT paid a humane wage. Oh, my head hurts... :yuck:

				Vinegar has become a kind of magic ingredient in all sorts of cleaning ways.&nbsp; I love it, and it helps that I don&#039;t mind the smell of vinegar, too (although it was quite off-putting at first).&nbsp; Here are some alternatives you might find works for you<br /><br />Homemade Toilet Cleaner: Mix ½ cup unscented castile soap and 2 cups baking<br />soda together. Dilute with ¼ cup water and 2 tbsp. Vinegar. This will make it<br />foam. Mix and pour into a squirt bottle. Squirt inside the toilet bowl, under the<br />rim and scrub with a toilet brush. Rinse and deodorize bowl with scented vinegar. <br /><br />Baking soda in the bowl will also scrub out stains. Add a few drops of tea tree,<br />pine or eucalyptus oil for a disinfectant. <br />+++++<br /><br />Borax might work for you also.&nbsp; While mildly toxic to humans and pets, it is gentle to the environment.&nbsp; I&#039;m not completely comfortable with it but might become in the future.<br /><br />Oh, and if the smell of vinegar is grody for you, here is an option.&nbsp; I may do it myself.<br /><br />Citrus Vinegar: Put your citrus rinds to good use. Cut lemon, orange, lime or<br />grapefruit rinds and put them in a jar. Cover rinds with white vinegar. Brew for<br />four weeks. Strain. Use your citrus vinegar in any of your cleaning recipes, or<br />dilute in water for a great floor cleaner, window washer, laundry<br />freshener/whitener, etc. <br />+++++<br /><br />It could be fun to meet up over tea or something and chat about these things in person!&nbsp; I know there was talk at one point about having a green cleaner workshop, too.

				Just started &quot;Organic, INC.&quot; so I still have to figure out if I like it or not. Last week (I think it was last week) I just finished &quot;It&#039;s a Long Road to a Tomato&quot; by Keith Stewart of Keith&#039;s Farm. Totally loved that book. Have you read that one? If not it is just a bunch of essays written by Farmer Stewart, and it really is very interesting. He went from working in the corporate world in NYC to starting his own farm in his 40s. I think he says in his book that they start going to the Greenmarket in Union Square at the end of May, and I hope to see their booth there soon. Would love to purchase from them.<br /><br />Another great farm-focused book I read probably more than a year ago is &quot;Harvest&quot; (http://www.harvest-book.com/home.htm). Really enjoyed that one as well, although it was not written by the farmers but by someone who spent time at the farm observing them. Kind of an anthropological viewpoint I suppose you could say.

				Yeah, I finished Keith Stewart&#039;s book last year and have passed it on to several friends, one of whom owns a dormant, 12 acre farm in PA and another who recently started a restaurant in VA with a focus on slow food and local ingredients (pretty easy as he&#039;s in the Shenandoah Valley). I&#039;ve also sent several heads of his Rocambole garlic to my mother-in-law in Houston and my sis in Dallas who are nearing their first harvests. I have Organic, Inc. in the to-be-read pile with The Omnivore&#039;s Dilemma sitting on top. It&#039;s next in line, though the hardcover&#039;s quite a lugger!

				The Omnivore&#039;s Dilemma is a good read - very enlightening. I especially enjoy the section where he visits this one guy&#039;s farm in Virginia (I think it is Virginia). It is interesting to read about how their farm is able to use all of its natural components (animal and plant life) to sustain the whole ecosystem. Very cyclical. I have to say, though, that since reading Pollan&#039;s book I am very aware of corn - well, and soy, too, but mainly corn. Wow - it&#039;s in EVERYTHING.

I read a long excerpt of his in the Times a while back and the part about soy and corn were creepy. I&#039;ve always seen ADM and the other giant agribusinesses as my own personal nemesis. As a vegan, soy is potentially even more prevalent in my diet. But I&#039;ve always eaten closer to the earth, so to speak, because I love to cook. Basically, I try to avoid all of those deliciously convenient fake &quot;meats&quot; and other highly processed soy products as much as possible. I make my own soymilk often thanks to this handy machine (http://www.soymilkmaker.com/soyapower.html). About .30 cents worth of dry organic soybeans (soaked overnight) makes 1.5 liters in about 20 minutes. Can&#039;t beat that with a stick! And thanks to this handy machine (http://www.cuisinart.com/catalog/product.php?product_id=375&amp;item_id=470&amp;cat_id=10) I don&#039;t have to go without the good stuff.

				Meg/Jayme (and everyone!) - I ran across this webpage today that lists out a bunch of different homemade cleaning solutions - http://eartheasy.com/live_nontoxic_solutions.htm<br /><br />DJArturo - we used to try to make our own tofu and soymilk. I forget the name of the machine we had but I don&#039;t think it is the same as what you&#039;ve got. We&#039;re vegan as well, but when I make milk I tend to make almond milk. It&#039;s pretty fast and easy compared to making soy milk. Plus I&#039;d rather consume homemade almond milk as opposed to soy milk since soy is in a tremendous amount of products as well. I still consume soy (tofu, fake meat, soy ice cream, etc.), but it weirds me out that it is in everything much like corn is. Of course, we don&#039;t regularly eat cereal with milk (I typically eat it dry at work) or drink it, so when I do need milk it is typically for recipes that call for milk.

				I checked the Dept of Sanitation website.<br /><br />Here is the relevant section on plastic. It&#039;s&nbsp; not as bad as I thought, because this would still include shampoo and lotion bottles, of No. 1&amp;2, where the neck is narrower than the body. <br /><br />And they <strong>still </strong> take <br />milk cartons &amp; juice boxes (or any such cartons and asceptic packaging for drinks: ice tea, soy milk, soup, etc.)&nbsp; <br /><br />Here is the link.- <br />http://www.nyc.gov/html/dsny/html/collection/recycling.shtml (http://www.nyc.gov/html/dsny/html/collection/recycling.shtml)<br />CAN I RECYCLE ANY OTHER PLASTICS BESIDES #1 &amp; #2 BOTTLES &amp; JUGS? <br /><br />At present, the NYC&#039;s recycling program accepts ONLY plastic bottles and jugs. CHECK THE NECK: if it&#039;s smaller than the body, put it in the recycling bin. If it is NOT a bottle or jug, put it in the regular garbage.<br /><br />Over 90% of all plastic bottles and jugs are made of #1 PET and #2 HDPE (ALSO SEE information on the recycling arrows ). Other plastic items, including tubs, trays, pots, toys, and bags, may be composed of any number of other resins (PS, LDPE, PVC, etc.) that are present in extremely low quantities in our waste stream. See what&#039;s in NYC&#039;s waste.<br /><br />Plastic resins must be sorted by type before they can be used to make new products. The presence of even small quantities of “contaminating” resins can ruin an entire batch of recycled plastic. Markets for recycled plastic are strong for PET and HDPE due to their significant presence in the waste stream and consumer commodities. Markets for other resins, due to their relatively small presence in the material economy, are weak or lacking. For both reasons, it is economically and environmentally advantageous to concentrate on HDPE and PET recycling over other resins.<br /><br />While some plastic yogurt and other wide-mouth containers are composed of #2 plastics, some are composed of other plastics, such as #5 (polypropylene) plastic. Wide-mouth containers or plastic bags made from #2 plastics can&#039;t be recycled along with #2 plastic bottles because they are formed differently and have different melting points.<br /><br />In other municipal recycling programs in the U.S., such as San Francisco, residents are encouraged to recycle all plastics in order to maximize the recycling rate of HDPE and PET. If residents do not have to think about which plastic to recycle or to discard, the thinking goes, they will recycle more overall.&nbsp; In such programs, non-HDPE and non-PET resins are usually sorted out and discarded at the recycling plant. The labor and disposal costs involved are justified by the higher yield of HDPE and PET that “all plastics” programs achieve. In New York City, high labor and transportation costs suggest that such an approach is not worth the expense and extra citizen effort.<br />

				I recently learned about the limits on plastic from the same mailing... it really is frustrating. And I&#039;ve spent SO much time cleaning and putting all those &quot;other&quot; 1 and 2 plastics in the recycling, now to find out I was wrong the whole time.&nbsp; And nobody else seems to understand it either, everyone I&#039;ve talked to has been surprised to hear it.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve been wondering if there is a place to take other recyclables.&nbsp; When I lived in other cities, where there was no curbside pickup, I had to take all my recyclables to a recycling center, so I wouldn&#039;t mind taking my other plastics somewhere occassionally if there is one reasonably close.&nbsp; Does anyone know?&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve seen some grocery stores have drop offs for recycling plastic bags but I haven&#039;t noticed any for a long time.&nbsp; I typically use cloth bags whenever possible.&nbsp; Also, I recently learned about reusable *produce* bags and I&#039;m waiting to receive my first order from reusablebags.com.&nbsp; They have a lot of interesting things there, including metal water containers.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;m new to this site but have been living in Astoria for five years.&nbsp; I&#039;m thrilled to see this thread and like the ideas thrown around a bit for a monthly get-together on green ideas.&nbsp; At a recent MoveOn.org houseparty in Astoria, I met a lot of local people concerned about improving recycling and making other green changes locally.&nbsp; So, I think there would be a lot of support for some environmental social activities/ activisim.&nbsp; Perhaps there are existing organizations that should reach out and recruit some new members... or maybe we should create a new one?

				I don&#039;t <em>think</em> you were wrong the whole time.&nbsp; &nbsp;I get the impression they are trying to simplify this for people who are not good at it.&nbsp; &nbsp;They are hoping their &quot;Check The Neck&quot;&nbsp; slogan will make it easier.&nbsp; I&#039;ve found that I&#039;m still able to recycle a lot.&nbsp; My vitamins come in a bottle, shampoo, lotion, mouthwash, water. <br />&nbsp; I&#039;ve noticed that I <em>can&#039;t</em> recycle&nbsp; the tubs hummus comes in, or egg packages.&nbsp; So far not a lot of other things.<br />&nbsp; As far as taking things elsewhere, I imagine it would have to be out of state where there are different rules. <br />I&#039;ve never seen&nbsp; recycling of bags at supermarkets either.. I missed that.

				Anyone see all the green stuff that is going on in the Bronx. Went to a conference hosted by the Bronx Borough President Adolfo Carrion with the founder of Greenpeace Dr. Patrick Moore. It was really amazing. Some of the stuff they are doing is really cutting age..funding green roofs, boiler retrofits, car free zones and days on weekends, bike to work days, a whole grant program for developers that use green materials...Does anyone know if this stuff is happening here..

				FYI, I received this today:<br /><br />Recycling Outreach Volunteers Needed<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />&nbsp;<br />Recycling in the city has declined and we need YOU to help get NYC recycling again!&nbsp; New Yorkers can recycle more, and the OROE borough-wide coordinators are working to train residents, building managers and landlords to recycle properly.&nbsp; New Yorkers can waste less too, so OROE provides an array of special waste collections for materials such as clothing and electronics.&nbsp; From tenant trainings in buildings to compost workshops in community gardens, recycling games and rap-offs in public places, OROE is out there teaching the public, and we are looking for dedicated volunteers who want to learn about recycling and then help spread the word citywide. <br /><br />Please RSVP by 12:00pm on Thursday, July 26th to attend the volunteer training on that evening from 6pm to 7:30pm in our offices&nbsp; near City Hall.&nbsp; Learn what is new with recycling in NYC and find out how you can get involved with OROE. Pizza and other refreshments will be provided.&nbsp; <br /><br />For more information or to RSVP and receive meeting location details contact Christina at 212-788-7989.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />&nbsp;<br />More about the Office of Recycling Outreach and Education: <br /><br />OROE was created at Council on the Environment of New York City at the end of 2006 when the NY City Council passed the Mayor’s 20-year Solid Waste Management Plan (i.e. the City’s vision for handling the 12,000 tons of waste NYC residents generate every single day). <br /><br />While OROE provides citywide recycling events and public education, our five borough-wide coordinators are conducting intensive outreach efforts on a Community Board by Community Board basis, starting in Community Boards 1 in Brooklyn (Greenpoint, Williamsburg), Queens (Astoria, Long Island City, Sunnyside), Bronx (Port Morris, Mott Haven and Melrose) Staten Island (North Shore) and Community Boards 10 and 11 in Manhattan (Central and East Harlem).

				We just had a baby girl end of March, and are now using cloth diapers about 80% of the time. We put her in disposables when we go out for the day or travel. I bought BumGenius diapers and they&#039;re awesome. <br /><br />We bought a portable washing machine that holds 10 liters of water, looks like a large blender, and works great! It&#039;s kept in the kitchen and we run one load every morning, hang the stuff up on a drying rack in the shower, then by evening it&#039;s all dry. More diapers for the next day. It saves electricity by not using a tumble dryer.<br /><br />For wipes, I&#039;ve got 25 cloth wipes that I bought off eBay. We just throw those in the washer with the diapers, then they&#039;re dry for the next day. That way we&#039;re not throwing away the disposable wipes.<br /><br />I&#039;m pretty happy about our diapering set up! :mrgreen:

				lobber, thanks for your clarification.&nbsp; From your posts, I assume that you&#039;re primarily concerned about social responsibility and consumerism.&nbsp; My biggest concerns are with waste and recycling.&nbsp; That is why I was glad to discover that I could just get an iced drink in a paper cup rather than a plastic cup, if I didn&#039;t have my commuter mug handy.&nbsp; I think that there is a lot of invective against multi-nationals, I&#039;m sure a lot of it well-deserved.&nbsp; I don&#039;t like being told what to think about big business and find it difficult to access comprehensive, unbiased information.&nbsp; However, I do know that discarded plastics take much much longer to degrade (if at all) than paper, and currently only plastic bottles and jugs can be recycled in NYC, not the plastic cups that iced drinks come in.<br /><br />If I drank coffee more than once a week or every other week for three months in the summer, I would consider investing in a coffee maker.&nbsp; But as it is, I&#039;m satisfied with the 6 or so iced coffees I&#039;ve had this summer from Starbucks.

				WALK. The one thing all relatively healthy, and&nbsp; not too healthy people can do is&nbsp; get outof your cars, vans, subway, bus and WALK. it&#039;s healthier, and if everyone on earth did this more, it would&nbsp; be better. i walk several miles&nbsp; a day, after&nbsp; a 15 year hiatus and cars making me fat and lazy. i have never felt better and&nbsp; use my car only&nbsp; on weekends&nbsp; for LONG trips&nbsp; out of town. Naturally, disabled, aged&nbsp; folks&nbsp; still need transport and if it&#039;s&nbsp; a night like tonight, of course&nbsp; you need&nbsp; some transport. But, when I see&nbsp; people get out of their place and into a car and drive&nbsp; two&nbsp; blocks to go eat, i have to laugh.&nbsp; :-)

				I love this kinda convo, and i&#039;m glad to see it&#039;s a sticky. I haven&#039;t gotten the chance to read all 10 pages, but i was wondering if anyone had any experience with two topics:<br />1) the greenmarket that&#039;s in Astoria: what&#039;s available and whenabouts it starts up again, <br />2) any community gardens in the neighb. I&#039;ve biked past one that&#039;s towards the waterfront, i think where 30th Ave ends, and have seen loads of supplies appear in what was a barren flat garden<br /><br />oh did someone mention biking? oh that was me ;) it always amazes me how biking into the city, even as far as the East or West village, is quicker than the subway, even with the long queens-to-manhattan incline&nbsp; of the QBBridge. and with a rate hike looming... any hints on biking in cold/inclement weather would be greatly appreciated!

				One thing I did recently which I felt pretty good about was getting my leather boots fixed. Sure there is the ethical question of whether I should have bought them in the first place, ok I accept that.&nbsp; My girlfriend got me these boots about two years ago for my birthday.&nbsp; I wore them a lot and the soles wore down and some of the stitching had come loose.&nbsp; On rainy days my socks were getting wet so I was going to throw them out and buy some new ones.&nbsp; However, I dropped by my local shoe repair man (Raphael on 28th between 43rd and 42nd St - nice guy) and he fixed them up for me for a mere $28.&nbsp; I got new soles, a new heel, and the stitching was all fixed.&nbsp; These boots are like new!<br /><br />So in one simple action, I prevented those boots from ending up in a landfill, saved some money, and responsibly reused the leather, plus the boots feel great and keep my feet dry now rain or snow! :mrgreen:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />

				Wetcleaning: An Alternative to Drycleaning (http://earth911.org/shopping/wetcleaning/)<br /><br />This is pretty interesting.

I would love to try permaculture. You can learn about it from oodles and oodles of videos online showing Bill Mollison (father of permaculture) going around the world preaching its virtues. This video of Sepp Holzer (http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=508596977234023761&amp;q=permaculture+europe&amp;ei=yn9hSPilKoTErwKNq7lG) is my favorite though. <br /><br />Right now, though, it would be most tough to start doing permaculture in our current living situation.

				Friends, Astorians, and Country(wo)men, lend me your ears!<br />&nbsp; Does anyone on this board share with my affinity to wander around the neighborhood on &quot;bulk pick up day&quot; to salvage great things that our neighbors throw away as &quot;trash, but are really treasures&quot;?&nbsp; I&#039;m not talking about tearing open garbage bags to find recyclables or eating out of dumpsters, but things that you either want or need that you can find on the street.<br />&nbsp; In the last few weeks, I&#039;ve found a beautiful office chair--in perfect condition--for my computer desk, twelve of those little white-wired shelves, which I used to organize my cabinets and freezer, a four plank cabinet, and an antique Chinese Shrine, that I cleaned up with a bit of oil soap.&nbsp; All in the trash! and free of charge..<br />&nbsp; In the past, I also found a vintage guitar and bazouki, as well as a lot of great artwork (oil paintings and objets d&#039;art) in the trash around my apartment.

Difference being, without getting into all the physics:<br />the newer type will regulate how many times the light will turn on and off every second. Since this happens very quickly it is very hard to notice this.&nbsp; This is why fluorescent lights have problems with dimmer switches, even the ones that are labeled &quot;dimmer capable&quot; (you can get better results if you run them for a few minutues to heat up the bulb).<br /><br />The older type control the brightness and the excess electricity is given off as heat.&nbsp; If you come across an older dimmer, touch it or try to touch the screws that hold it to the wall, since heat will transfer better on the metal than on the plastic - you will feel that it is quite warm on the lower settings.<br /><br />hope this helps.

				I think the Major grocery stores are now collecting them.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m pretty sure that Key Food at Ditmars and Best Yet on 20th Ave both have collection containers.

				All grocery stores are supposed to accept them.&nbsp; Key Food at Ditmars def has a container, and I use it regularily.&nbsp; And they take all plastic bags, not just key food bags.

				This is sort of an ad as well as a request--<br /><br />Someone above mentioned knowing the origins of things that you buy and I completely agree.&nbsp; I used to be a union organizer and since I had my first child now work from home operating an online business selling organic baby clothing, cloth diapers, and specialty products for a very green practice of &quot;diaper free baby&quot;.&nbsp; I disclose where every product is made and only sell fair trade or made in USA, Australia, Europe, Japan.&nbsp; Many of my products are sewn by moms working from their own homes.&nbsp; (Did you know the typical American baby contributes over a cubic TON of disposable plastic diapers to landfills, that will take over 500 years to decompose?)&nbsp; My site is www.ecwear.com and by appointment in Astoria.<br /><br />My request and RECYCLING OPPORTUNITY is that I reuse mailing envelopes and would love to have your used envelopes.&nbsp; Tyvek, paper (manilla), poly/plastic, especially without bubble lining but even with okay-- anything over 6x8 inches.&nbsp; Priority Mail packaging okay.&nbsp; I will remove or failing that, completely obliterate your address for privacy.&nbsp; &nbsp; I don&#039;t need boxes though, all the baby clothes are small!&nbsp; <br /><br />If you have a lot, I will come to pick them up... I am also thinking of asking my CSA if they would be willing to be a central drop off location...<br />Thanks!

				Am wondering if anyone knows of an online community/forum similar to this one, except focused entirely on sustainable/green lifestyles? I&#039;m seeing quite a few, but so far I haven&#039;t found anything that seems to be very active. Ideally I&#039;d like to find one where there is a lot of activity so that my questions are quickly answered and good discussions can get going pretty quickly.

				Yeah I saw that one, but it didn&#039;t seem to have enough variety of boards. Of course, maybe I just didn&#039;t look through it hard enough. I&#039;ll take a look again.

				Most Rite Aid stores have a bin right next to the exit door to put plastic bags into for recycling, that&#039;s where I always take mine. When I can though, which is probably 90% of the time, I use cloth bags for shopping. I also have a habit of re-using zip lock bags. I buy the really good quality ones and just wash them out, and use them over and over again. My boyfriend thinks I am a bit nuts for doing it, but i&#039;d say it&#039;s probably been about 6-8 months since I have had to buy a new box of zip lock bags lol...&nbsp; :lol:<br /><br />Also, does anyone know of a place in Astoria to take used batteries to be recycled? I have a huge bag of used AA batteries I need to take in, but I am trying to find a place closer to my apartment to take them.&nbsp; :-P

				Right on Lin!&nbsp; I do the same thing and it saves a lot of money!&nbsp; Some people think it&#039;s weird, but unless you have something particularly greasy or pungent, it works just fine.&nbsp; Though I am a huge advocate for tupperware and reusable containers for things like sandwiches that you might use every day.&nbsp; I have the wrap-n-mat (http://www.reusablebags.com/store/wrapnmat®-p-2.html (http://www.reusablebags.com/store/wrapnmat®-p-2.html)) and I love it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Personally, I use my plastic bags as garbage bags since I don&#039;t have a whole lot of household garbage.&nbsp; If I didn&#039;t re-use them, I would definitely be using my own tote bags for shopping.&nbsp; This bag is a really good bag that is super strong, made of recycled water bottles, and has shoulder/tote straps.&nbsp; I have them in a few colors and buy them as gifts too. http://www.reusablebags.com/store/acme-bags™-ultracompact-tote-circle-recycled-fabric-p-1574.html (http://www.reusablebags.com/store/acme-bags™-ultracompact-tote-circle-recycled-fabric-p-1574.html)&nbsp; &nbsp;I also think there&#039;s a huge need for <strong>produce bags</strong> that are reusable. Since the plastic ones tend to be flimsy and don&#039;t have handles there are so many that get thrown out!&nbsp; http://www.reusablebags.com/store/smartcycle-recycled-produce-medium-p-1639.html (http://www.reusablebags.com/store/smartcycle-recycled-produce-medium-p-1639.html) I have bags like these and I love them.&nbsp;

				I have a bunch of tote bags and keep one in my messenger bag or my bass bag just in case I make an unplanned stop at a store.&nbsp; Hmm.. maybe I&#039;ll unload some for free on here if my collection keeps growing.<br /><br />I just got two 500-page bagasse sugar paper reams (80% sugar cane waste/20% cert. plantation fiber) I&#039;d ordered from ecopaper.com.&nbsp; While looking for tree-free printing paper, I came across hemp paper, banana plant paper, cotton fiber paper, and paper made of.. yes, elephant crap.

				I don&#039;t have anything to attach them with. They&#039;re just long plastic boxes that fit on the windowsill.&nbsp; I had them out on the stoop last summer and grew lettuce in them.&nbsp; I had one on my kitchen window sill for a while and grew onion shoots and herbs in it. contact me off-list if you want them - margotlev at gmail<br /><br />

				Hey I haven&#039;t been able to read every comment in this feed as it&#039;s pretty long but it seems that a lot of people are taking some really important steps in the right direction. Seriously, congratulations! It&#039;s important to show that you care for your community and your body. They&#039;re both pretty irreplaceable and have a huge impact on one another. <br /><br />For those of you doing a lot of cooking with fresh, local or maybe organic produce have you considered composting your kitchen scraps? There are several drop off sites in the surrounding area including, the actual markets that you may buy your produce from. <br /><br />Check out the site for drop-off times and locations<br /><br />http://bignyc.org/drop-sites<br />

				Hey everybody!&nbsp; Glad to see this topic here.<br />I too try to remember to have my Baggu shopping bag with me at all times.&nbsp; Sometimes I might forget it&#039;s in my other tote bag, or it might be in my &#039;laundry&#039; pile.&nbsp; (I do try to wash it pretty regularly since food, i.e., fresh watermelon etc. can sometimes leek in my bag)..<br />But anyway, for those shopping trips where I DO need to take a plastic bag from the store, I save all of mine up and then bring them to Whole Foods, who accepts plastic bags for recycling.<br />Does anyone know of any places besides Butcher Bar on 30th Ave., that sell grass-fed, antibiotic-free meats?&nbsp; What about good quality fish?<br />I also agree that living in NYC automatically makes us greener than most...that is, assuming we use public transportation only.&nbsp; (I have to say I&#039;m shocked and disheartened at the number of NYers...generally in the outer boroughs but still close to public transportation, who have cars!)&nbsp; I make orders from Fresh Direct maybe 5 times per year, and for those orders I try to stock up especially on heavier, bulkier items like laundry detergent, paper products, etc.&nbsp; (And Fresh Direct carries many Seventh Generation items.)<br />For those of you who may happen to live in the vicinity of 21st Street and 30th Drive, there is a guy who runs Hellsgate Farms, and who invites people in the nabe to drop off compost at his house on 30th Drive.&nbsp; (I don&#039;t know the exact address...I just know the house by site, but if interested you can google Hellsgate Farms and ask him about composting.&nbsp; Right now I think just a handful of people who happen to know this guy drop stuff off, but I&#039;m sure he&#039;d appreciate others doing the same.&nbsp; You can also get info on where this guy offers his produce.&nbsp; I know last year he had an arrangement with Queens Kickshaw on Bway, where they offered some of his produce for sale.)&nbsp; I know that this guy, Rob, is also looking to facilitate more green homes in the area. )<br />Which brings me to a related question.... I myself am interested in purchasing a home in Astoria and couldn&#039;t afford a single family on my own....nor are there many single families to choose from.&nbsp; I&#039;d love to see if I could find one or two other people to maybe buy a 2-3 family home.&nbsp; I&#039;m looking for like-minded people who&#039;d be interested in having a vegetable/fruit garden on the property, a rain barrel, maybe a chicken coop if we have the room, solar panels, composting, etc.&nbsp; There may or may not be some communal space in the building...a living type area perhaps with a small kitchen, but overall I&#039;d envision we&#039;d have our own &#039;apartments&#039;...and that the communal aspect would be mainly with regards to the external aspect of the home (green energy use, outdoor space, etc.).&nbsp; Naturally we&#039;d need to meet up, talk about our own personal goals, understand everybody&#039;s financial situations, our ideas of what kind of home we&#039;d want, and we&#039;d need to have our own lawyers to ensure our own needs are all met.&nbsp; <br />If anyone might be interested in just meeting up for starters, and seeing if we are on the same page, you can email me directly at yippee1999@yahoo.com.<br />Thanks!!<br />Lynn
