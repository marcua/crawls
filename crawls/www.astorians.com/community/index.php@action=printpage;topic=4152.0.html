				It&#39;s not, though.&nbsp; There&#39;s a new Brazilian restaurant near it called Favela, and there is a Chinese place, I think.&nbsp; Also the Irish Rover, Wassi, and another cafe-type place are there.&nbsp; I wonder if the commenter meant the only Egyptian restaurant on the Avenue...

				It is very good.<br /><br />Magdi (the owner) is super duper pleasant and lovely.&nbsp; The Friday and Saturday night dinner clientele is fun -- and if you want to go play cards, they know some rocking good games.&nbsp; Very good place for eating or just relaxing.&nbsp; <br /><br />I haven&#39;t been in a while (and was publicly admonished on the street for my absence) but I used to regularly play cards on Fridays.&nbsp; Something a little like rummy in concept but much more difficult (and addictive).&nbsp; <br /><br />Chicken dishes are really my favorite.&nbsp; Blackened/roasted, good.<br /><br />Several flavors of hookah (shesha?).<br /><br />Try the lemon drink.&nbsp; Yum.&nbsp; Also good, turkish coffee.<br /><br />

				Do they allow people to bring alcohol?<br /><br />Jim and I tried another new place on Steinway this week - a Moroccan place called Marjana, next to Carvel.&nbsp; It deserves its own thread, but I&#39;ll just say that it was mostly delicious and really reasonable -- the most expensive thing on the menu was $11.&nbsp; It&#39;s got a pretty nice atmosphere, is BYO for now, but they expect a liquor license in the next couple of months.

				I have a few things to say about Al Omda..&nbsp; I&#39;ve never eaten there- but I did used to have a friend that lived above it, and me and several other musicians used to rent out the basement of that building to store our musical instruments and use as a rehearsal space and what not..&nbsp; Magdi was a jerk to everyone else in the building-&nbsp; He would tell his customers that they could park their cars in the driveway (which didn&#39;t belong to him).&nbsp; This caused all sorts of problems for us trying to get our musical instruments in and out, not to mention ourselves out of the place (god forbid there was a fire).&nbsp; &nbsp;Then he had the nerve to yell and get pissed off at us when I&#39;d ask him to move the car so I could drive _my_ car into _my_ driveway and unload my stuff.<br /><br />Secondly, when he started running that restaurant, he would dump all of the cooking grease or whatever down the sink instead of getting rid of it properly.&nbsp; I can tell you, there have been at least three to four &quot;floods&quot; in the basement of that place- and these are not floods that you want to be anywhere near, if you know what I mean.&nbsp; <br /><br />So in a nutshell, I&#39;ll never set foot in that place.<br /><br />Tim
