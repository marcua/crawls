				There is no doubt that there are terrorists plotting to kill more Americans.&nbsp; Health care has nothing to do with this.&nbsp; We cannot simply allow everything to go by the wayside and just worry about terrorists.&nbsp; There are far too many issues out there to worry about these days.&nbsp; <br /><br />Kids are bullying each other into committing suicide.<br />Our country is getting fatter and fatter and unhealthier every day.<br />Locally, it is getting more difficult for people to commute with the MTA cuts.<br />People are looking for work and not finding jobs.<br />Our toxic environment is killing us.<br />Countless other issues.&nbsp; <br />Personally, I cannot spend any more time worrying about terrorists.

				In 2003 I got a job Off-Broadway. I saved two of my comp tickets for the Long Island HS teacher who helped me get to that point in my career.

The next one may be a <em>dirty</em> bomb. It <em>ain&#039;t</em> just ole &#039;racist??? or &#039;paranoid&#039; little ole&nbsp; FZ&nbsp; saying this, but, President Obama, just&nbsp; today. http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100412/ap_on_go_pr_wh/us_obama &nbsp;(http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100412/ap_on_go_pr_wh/us_obama) You know one nuke can do alot of damage. BTW, Pointing out the ideology, even if has a religious&nbsp; component, is not&nbsp; racist or even racial. One&nbsp; can be of any race, color, creed and be a&nbsp; Muslim, Jew, Christain or&nbsp; Buddhist. In any event, these&nbsp; Islamic&nbsp; based terrorists are even a&nbsp; bigger threat to fellow Muslims, which, they kill in droves&nbsp; in those suicide&nbsp; bombings in Iraq and elsewhere.
