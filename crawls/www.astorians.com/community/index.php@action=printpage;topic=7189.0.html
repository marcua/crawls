				http://www.avaloncommunities.com/avaloncore/nfloor.asp?comm=119<br />According to this website, the cheapest one bedroom starts at $2240 a month.&nbsp; Not exactly moderate in my book, but perhaps it is for a luxury apartment that is not in Manhattan.&nbsp; You can get much more for your money in Astoria for those prices.&nbsp;

				My friend just moved into Avalon Riverview North today. She&#039;s in a 2 bedroom apartment (there&#039;s 3 of them sharing the apartment.) They&#039;re putting up a wall in the living room to make a 3rd bedroom out of it. Supposedly it&#039;s huge and has a washer/dryer in the apartment itself (which really impressed me).

				No, their 2 bedroom (converted to 3 bedrm) doesn&#039;t have a balcony. <br /><br />The master bedroom has it&#039;s own bathroom and walk-in closet. There&#039;s another full bathroom in the apartment as well. <br /><br />I believe their total rent comes to $3,100, which they split (not evenly since the person with the master bedroom has to pay more than the others for obvious reasons). <br /><br />They also had to pay a one-time amenities fee of $500. Luckily I saw an ad at the movie theater that said if you bring your movie stub into your lease signing they&#039;ll take $200 off your amenities fee. I gave it to them and they saved the money. I now have free access to the swimming pool in the building when it opens (yes! haha).<br /><br />

				That&#039;s awesome.&nbsp; From what I understand they are fairly flexible with both leases terms and monthly rent.&nbsp; I am also interested in Rockrose which has currently one building and about to open (pre-leasing) another.&nbsp; Apparently, they charge a bit more monthly but have less fees to pay.<br /><br />The entire area seems great, albeit a little underdeveloped (lack of grocery store and shops) but that will come with time.&nbsp; I understand in the new Rockrose building they have come to an agreement with a large supermarket to be housed in the basement.&nbsp; I can only hope this is Whole Foods which is in the basement of the Time Warner building.<br /><br />Thanks for the info!

				I don&#039;t know anything about these specific apartments, but there are some Avalon properties back home, and they always (seemed like) really nice, well maintained places and the management company was decent to deal with (I had to for work for a little while, we housed some of our out-of-town seasonal staff there). When I was 20-ish, I even knew a few people from the local college that lived there - the university worked it out so that some kids could dorm there (they knocked down and rebuilt some dorms as part of expansion). Imagine having your dorm being this really nice condo-type complex! I was all, &quot;wow, maybe I *should* go away to school,&quot; haha.<br /><br />Just thought I&#039;d add that it seems like Avalon is a decent company to rent from, if you&#039;re looking for this type of place. But I do think that $2200 is a LOT for a 1BR. Gah. (But yeah, I guess they can get away with it with nice views and whatnot.)

				Yeah I don&#039;t think i could ever stomach paying that much rent. I know there are so many amenities (pool, 24 hour concierge, sun deck). When I really think about it, who needs all that extra stuff? I live fine without it now.

				Avalon, Citylights they all have great views but are highly over priced for LIC especially now when the neighborhood is just developing.&nbsp; The other buildings are going up in such a fast pace that I would not be surprised if the walls are somewhat thin.&nbsp; Then again, some people are calling LIC midtown now because its one stop away and the neighborhood is full of tourists on the weekends, with an upper west side crusty vibe taking over. . . EEEK!&nbsp; <br /><br />Although I must say that the view from that park is really amazing.&nbsp; I love it there and the piers are awesome!&nbsp; BTW if you do move in, you can hear yours truly spinning the best latin, funk, electro, house, old school hip hop, 80s and rare grooves on friday nights at La Vuelta, 10-43 44th Drive in LIC

				Why assume people can&#039;t live in these apartments AND save money?&nbsp; Just b/c people live in cheap apartments don&#039;t necessarily suggest they are saving either.&nbsp; Any landlord is able to levy such a fine for late rent, the higher the rent the steeper the fine.&nbsp; Nothing earth shattering there.

It&#039;s great that you have a good deal and are happy with it. But the fact is that a lot of us really love this neighborhood for a variety of reasons and this is the sad state of rentals in astoria. Not to mention co-ops and the few and far between condos. For a lot of us, we may gripe about the price but we find it worth it to stay in this community. When it becomes too much, some of us pack it in and move elsewhere. It&#039;s how it works in rentals and real estate. You either can afford it or you can&#039;t.<br />However your constant attacks against those of us who do pay through the nose for our living spaces, or if we want to buy proptery is really unnecessary. It seems you are attempting to make us all feel stupid and like we were hoodwinked for paying more than $2000 for an apartment that is not up to some standard you have. We who have been here a while, and even those just starting to navigate the area know that this area comes with a price. But if we are willing to pay that price for whatever reason, that is of our concern. Your constant attacks on people wishing to purchase property for what it is going for in this area or renting for x amount of money is truly insulting to the community spirit on this forum. Now i&#039;m not saying &quot; if you don&#039;t have something nice to say, don&#039;t say anything at all&quot; as we are all entitled to our opinions, but your way of sharing your opinions by attacking other members is really unwarrented and IMHO unwelcome. <br />my $0.02
