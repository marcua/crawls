				Dude, that sounds like a great ride.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think I can make that trip quite yet but I&#039;ve been biking a lot lately.&nbsp; Last weekend I biked from my place to my friend&#039;s place in Woodside then we went over to Flushing Meadow Park and back.&nbsp; About 16 miles of biking spread over a casual 4 hours.<br /><br />I&#039;d definitely be interested in the Astoria -&gt; Triborough -&gt; Manhattan -&gt; 59th Street Bridge -&gt; Astoria trip.<br /><br />When do you usually do this trip?<br /><br />I can&#039;t wait to do the 5 Boro Bike Tour next year.

				I&#039;ve taken that route once this season, and am looking forward to doing it again once it stops RAINING. The construction on the Triboro is a momentum killer, but it&#039;s only temporary. Wouldn&#039;t mind doing the trip with some others. Any day planned yet?

				It&#039;s Hoyt Ave North to be exact, right around 28th St. The stairs are a trip all right, but a fun &quot;cyclecross&quot; experience (bike portage!)<br /><br />PJ- try www.mapmyride.com to record this and other rides. Whenever we do a long ride, my fiance obsessively re-traces the route when we&#039;re home, then we see how many miles we did. It&#039;s a lot of fun and a good way to share rides with others.<br /><br />

				I got mine at Bicycle Habitat (http://bicyclehabitat.com/) on Lafayette in Manhattan. They offer free tune-ups for life when you purchase your bike from them, but I get the feeling that anyone could probably walk in and get their bike checked over and tightened up.<br /><br />I looked at Gary Fisher, Trek, and Specialized, but I ended up with a Marin Muirwoods 29er (http://www.marinbikes.com/2009/us/bikes/specs_muirwoods_29er.php). It just felt like a perfect fit, so I bought it.

				That Trek 7.1 seems to be a commuting bike, perhaps thinner tires can make it a tad faster, also not using tires with knobs on them. But not much else you can do. <br /><br />For a &quot;fast&quot; bike you need a road bike, but that probably doesn&#039;t match your style of riding. Bigger cranks, more leg power is really the only thing that can help go faster or a more aerodynamic position, since after a certain speed wind-resistance is your biggest enemy

				^^ What he said ^^ :wink:<br /><br />I would call my bike fast enough for me. I&#039;m sure it wouldn&#039;t win a downhill road race with a dedicated road bike, but that&#039;s not really what I was looking for. I wanted a bike that would work for riding around the city and the variety of different terrain we encounter here. I opted for the 29er rims and tires because they are a bit larger in diameter than a typical off-road / mountain-bike so they take pot holes, bumps, and curbs a bit better. I also choose a bike with a steel frame because I liked how it rode over the felt-stiffer-to-me but slightly lighter aluminum frame bikes. I pretty much looked at bikes from the manufacturer&#039;s &quot;urban&quot; and &quot;city&quot; lines because they actually fit what I was looking for -- hybrid / mountain-bike frames, maneuverable mountain-bike handle bars, slightly more upright but not cruising riding position, semi smooth tires (definitely not knobby like off-road tires), mechanical disk brakes, and upper mid hardware components.<br /><br />It&#039;s all what your looking to do. If you want to zip around the roadway in central park then you are probably going to want a dedicated road bike, but if you are looking for something that will get you around town and allow you to explore areas that you might not venture to on foot then a &quot;urban,&quot; &quot;city,&quot; &quot;cyclocross,&quot; &quot;fitness,&quot; or &quot;commuter&quot; bike are probably what your looking for. IMHO :mrgreen:

				sorry to thread-jack a little bit here, but...<br /><br />Where are the local bike shops in Astoria? What should I expect to pay for a basic tune up? I just dragged my bike out of my parent&#039;s garage for the first time in 2-3 years. Looking to get it off-road ready again. It&#039;s in good shape, but I&#039;d like to have the chain/gears tuned and lubed up. Two flats too, but I think it just needs air, not new tubes :)
