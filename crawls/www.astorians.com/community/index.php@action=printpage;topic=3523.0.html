				:x<br /><br />Is it just me or does Key Food suck? With exception to a handful of employees, their cashiers are rude and have not been trained properly. And if they have been adequately trained, have not been corrected (or reprimanded) sufficiently when they have done something wrong or out of line. I have worked as a cashier in three different grocery stores and each one was very careful how they trained their employees. There were three things which held true for each:<br /><br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>You must respect your customer, and essentially your customer is always right.</li><li>There is a proper way to bag items, i.e. bread and eggs don&#39;t sit on the bottom of the bag with cans of food on top. Or chemical items such as toilet cleaner should not be bagged with food items. And don&#39;t throw produce around!</li><li>You need to wear your uniform, and it needs to be worn correctly.</li></ul><br />So today our cashier was disrespectful. He didn&#39;t even pay attention to what he was doing. When it came to the end of our stuff there was a very obvious break in between our stuff and the next person&#39;s groceries. Yet he grabbed their stuff and started scanning. I kept asking him to stop, but he kept doing it. He even did it with the person in front of us with <em>our</em> groceries. He also was getting visibly upset when one of our items wouldn&#39;t scan, and seemed very put out when he had to type the item in.<br /><br />When he went to bag our items he was throwing all the wrong stuff together - chemical cleaner with produce, and he was banging our produce around. Our bananas scarcely last long enough as it is, so banging it around isn&#39;t exactly going to help further its existence.<br /><br />And hello - he looked terribly sloppy. He didn&#39;t even have a proper name tag. He had taken a permanent marker and written his name on the front of his Key Food apron (which wasn&#39;t tied even).<br /><br />I may seem to be really nitpicky on the last item, but the fact that you don&#39;t even present yourself properly just makes the whole thing worse. The grocery stores I worked in would have not stood for that sort of appearance.<br /><br />I know that there are other things as well - things being priced incorrectly, but the cashier thing really really bugs me. I have found myself fuming on more than one occasion after dealing with their crappy customer service. I feel like most of the people that suck are the teenagers that are just floating through. I know that isn&#39;t entirely fair because there are actually a couple of teenagers that do a decent job, but most don&#39;t care and think that it is cool for them to be gossiping with the next cashier or even on their cell phone as they scan your stuff (not kidding - that has happened). I can think of about four or five people that I actually like in that store and they are all over 40, maybe even 50.<br /><br />Sigh...young people these days... :roll:

				Rude supermarket cashiers are a big pet peeve for me. It bothers me every time. I had a cashier at the Key Food on 30th Ave seriously tell another cashier about how she spent time in juvenile prison while she was scanning my food! It is generally the teenage cashiers, and I&#39;ve had them not bother to look at me, practically throw my receipt at me, etc, etc.&nbsp; I haven&#39;t encountered a supermarket in Astoria that has particularly good (or even decent) customer service when it comes to the cashiers.<br /><br />Sometimes, I do think, it&#39;s a crappy, boring job that doesn&#39;t pay well and I wouldn&#39;t like it either. But that doesn&#39;t excuse the bad customer service. For some reason, I&#39;ve never complained to managers about this, but I don&#39;t know that that would do any good anyway. <br /><br />

				I think Key Food sucks for the following reasons:<br /><br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>Nearly every time I go through checkout at least one item rings up as the wrong price. It would be one thing if this happened occasionally, but when it happens over and over and becomes &quot;expected&quot; it gets a bit old.</li><li>Things are not shelved right. Frequently you pick an item off the shelf and then have to go hunting for the price tag for it.</li><li>The check-out people frequently bruise up all my produce. They slam it around while gossiping with each other about who knows what.</li><li>Find an item you like? You might not ever see it again. Then 6-12 months later it shows up again on the shelf.</li><li>The check-out people never ask for a Key Food card. So if you&#39;re there buying some sale item and you forget, too bad. Other stores always ask for the card.</li></ul><br />I just don&#39;t think their management gives a rip about how their store operates. <br /><br />I simply <em>hate</em> that store. If there was another one I could go to I absolutely would. It&#39;s in moments like these I wish I had a car.

				Key Food may be especially bad, but C-Town is no great shakes either, though they have improved in the last year or two.&nbsp; They used to be aggressively unpleasant, now they just don&#39;t care.

				i once saw an old Greek Lady and the cashier girl insulting eachother in Greek in front of me in line. it was really uncomfortable especially when the girl threw the change at the woman, and while the girl was checking out my stuff, they continued to insult eachother, the woman wouldn&#39;t leave. agh. yes, those young cashiers really need to get their act together.

				Key Food is pretty bad, yes, and especially their unbelievably incompetent and slow checkout idiots, but: <br /><br />* It&#39;s 30 times better than the old Met Foods (future Staples) near the Astoria Blvd stop.<br />* It has a respectable (if overpriced) selection of organic and natural foods.<br />* Ever since they redid the store last year, the lighting and aisles are much nicer.<br />* It has Heinekin Dark and Dogfish Head Raison D&#39;Etre beer.<br /><br />This said, I almost never buy vegetables, meat, or bread there. Just packaged goods, paper goods, etc.

				Key Food does have a pretty good beer selection, it&#39;s true.&nbsp; Also a decent number of Sabra hummus and salads.&nbsp; But yeah, their checkout lines suck and it&#39;s more often than not a negative experience.

				I have only been to Best Yet once, and have only been there once because of the trek. Key Food is the closest grocery store to us, so of course, that is where we shop. I know that bigger stores like Best Yet and Stop &amp; Shop are more professional (at least typically), but they&#39;re just so far away. Then again we do make an effort to go to Trader Joe&#39;s in Union Square once every six weeks or so, and we tend to buy a crapload of stuff there.<br /><br />As for Fresh Direct - we have done that before, but haven&#39;t used them in over a year. I do love how the groceries are brought to you - that&#39;s totally worth it. I&#39;ll have to check them out again.

				I&#39;d love to go to Best Yet - alas, if only I had a car. I&#39;ve heard good things from several people about that store who also don&#39;t shop at Key Food. And it&#39;s good to hear that Key Food is better than the Met. Obviously I buy all my groceries there so I hope they don&#39;t go out of business or anything, but I sure think they could use some help in there management/training/customer service departments.<br /><br />When I lived up near Steinway I don&#39;t remember Trade Fair being much better honestly, maybe we just have a couple of not-so-hot grocery stores in our neighborhood.

				I&#39;m not sure how far Best Yet is from you, but as a single woman (shopping for one) I&#39;m usually able to get most of a week&#39;s worth of groceries into a backpack and carry them a fair distance. Using a backpack rather than just carrying the bags makes it easier to carry the weight for a long distance, and also eliminates the need to use up more plastic. Though I have to work to keep the cashiers from immediately bagging my stuff when I do that... <br /><br /><br />This reminds me that I need a new backpack so that I can really go grocery shopping again.

				I have to agree with most of what you&#39;re saying about Key Food, but today, I did have a nice experience there.&nbsp; I had noticed the lettuce was old, and the workers were replacing all the veggies, so I asked about the lettuce.&nbsp; The guy went out of his way to go and find a fresh head of green leaf lettuce for me, from the back somewhere.&nbsp; It was really nice of him.&nbsp; He was in his 40&#39;s?&nbsp; There&#39;s also another guy in his 50&#39;s? that consistently asks me how I&#39;m doing, wishes me a good weekend, always recognizes me.&nbsp; And yes, then there are the teenagers, who are always flirting and gossiping with each other.&nbsp; Some are nice, some are just plain immature and disrepectful.&nbsp; For the most part though, I do get them to smile at me.&nbsp; They definitely need more training.<br /><br />I do like the food and cleanliness of the place though.&nbsp; It&#39;s way better than the disgusting smelly Trade Fair on 38 and Ditmars.&nbsp; And bigger.

				Just had a bad experience there a couple of days ago involving one of my supermarket pet peeves, but it turned out kinda funny: <br /><br />There were two regular lanes open and one so-called &quot;10 limit&quot; lane. The store was busy and everyone in the express lane had their carts full, way more than the &quot;limit&quot;, but the cashiers never say anything, so when you have 2 or 3 things ya have to wait half an hour. <br /><br />This really, really irritates me.<br /><br />So then they announce the &quot;office&quot; lane is open for <span class="bbc_u">10 items or under</span>. Great - I dash over and am third in line. Then I notice the woman in front of me has her mid-sized wheelie cart full of all kinds of frozen, canned, veggies, etc and starts to put them on the counter. I call her on it and she asks the cashier can she come through the line. The cashier only sees the 2 items in her hand and says yes. I point out the cart-full of stuff out to the cashier who looks over the counter and says &quot;Oh I didn&#39;t know you had so much&quot;. The customer starts griping and I pointed out the announcement said 10 or less and asked the cashier, who I&#39;m pretty sure MADE the announcement, &quot;Isn&#39;t that what you said&quot;. She just stared at me. So I just stepped in front of the customer and told the still-staring cashier &quot;It&#39;s okay, ring me up.&quot; I see the other 5 or so people in line, each with a couple of things, bristling at the sight of the cart. My transaction is done and I&#39;m rounding the corner for the back door when the customer starts &quot;you have a lotta nerve, blah-blah-blah&quot; at me and - this is so beautiful - almost in unision the people in the line practically scream &quot;10 OR LESS!!&quot; I busted out laughing, it was soooooo hilarious, I laughed all the way home. &nbsp; :evil: Shoppers revolt!<br /><br />But yes, that store sucks big time.

				Texas, you make me crack up sometimes.&nbsp; There&#39;s another old lady there with black hair who does yell at you for having over 10 items.&nbsp; I had one too many yogurts one day (they&#39;re small - I didn&#39;t notice) in my little red basket, and she yelled at me.&nbsp; I suppose she was in the right, but I never like a grumpy old lady yelling at me.&nbsp; At lot of the cashiers are pretty slow, and sometimes between the slowness, and this one&#39;s yelling over one too many yogurts, they actually make the wait longer.&nbsp; But I can totally understand being upset over the whole idiotic thing of showing up with a whole cart full of food, rather than a tiny basket.&nbsp;

				Typically each individual item counts as one item - so two yogurts are two yogurts. If you buy a six-pack of beer, that wouldn&#39;t be six beers but one product. I think that it is silly for them to turn you away if you have 11 or 12 items, but yeah, I think that the people who go into those &quot;express&quot; lanes with a full cart are either illiterate, stupid, don&#39;t care, or know that they can get away with it.

				I would think that if they were the same brand and price it would be one item as it would be one scanning (they wouldn&#39;t scan both), but I can understand counting each item as one.&nbsp; If the two yogurts were different brands and each were scanned separately, it would be clearly two.

				I can&#39;t stand shopping at Key Food for that exact reason. Aside from people cheating the express lane (which is just pathetic), the cashiers are maddeningly slow. Well, and their prices are noticeably higher than Trade Fair&#39;s. <br /><br />I had a ridiculous cashier experience at the local Eckerd recently also. I get up to the counter and the cashier is a young guy. I had like three items. As he goes to scan them, he very deliberately wipes his finger across his nose and he was sniffling. So that was disgusting. Then he boredly scans them and I heard one of the items, a toothbrush, beep twice. I suspected this meant it got scanned twice, but as he acted like it was normal I didn&#39;t say anything. The price came to higher than expected, so I paid and looked at the receipt when he handed it to me. Lo and behold, two toothbrushes were on the receipt. <br /><br />So I went back in line because he was ringing up some other people, and I got up to him again and he just looked at me. I said &quot;The toothbrush scanned twice.&quot; I had to explain this a few times and said I needed a refund. He went to get a refund slip and asked if I needed a new receipt. I said &quot;No, I just want the money.&quot; He then said &quot;I&#39;ll need to get a manager if you need a new receipt.&quot; And I said, &quot;No.. I just want the money.&quot; <br /><br />Then he needed a pen to fill out the slip, but he was not interested in using the one on the counter by the credit card scanner. He asked the cashier behind him for a pen. She seemed tired of him and pointed out the one on the counter. He said &quot;I&#39;m not using that.&quot; So she gave him a pen and he used it. Then he passed the pen and paper to me to fill out my part. I was disgusted by his nose wiping and sniffling so I used the other pen.<br /><br />So then he gave me my money back. Then he went to put the toothbrush under the counter. I said, &quot;I still want the toothbrush.&quot; He was very confused by this. I once again explained that I needed the refund because the one toothbrush rang up as two. So he gave it to me and I left. I&#39;ve never been so annoyed by a cashier.

				i&#39;m glad to read that other people have the same issues at key foods. i go there only for beer now. and i had a semi-similar experience with the 10 items or less line... i was complaining to my fiancee about the person few ahead of us with clearly more than 10 items and i just blurted out, &quot;i think it should be illegal!&quot; well, the nice old man directly in front of us thought that was a riot. and his laugher resulted in the embarassment of said violator, though not in their ejection from the line.

				The Key Food on 30th Avenue started going downhill about 3 years ago when it changed management. Since then they had poor quality produce at high quality prices. Recently however they added new refrigerators for produce and increased both the quality and selection. Keep an eye out for their dairy products, they are notorious for keeping yogurt, cheeses, and even some milk products past their stale date. I have even pointed out the past due date to the stockboy, and when I return days later the same container is still there, which means they are told not to throw anything out.<br /><br />Most of the cashiers are still unprofessional though, but that&#39;s more due to poor training and oversight than the cashiers themselves. Employees will not perform above the level that&#39;s expected of them.

				I moved to Astoria six months ago after 20 years living on the West Coast (but grew up in the NY area) where cashiers are almost too polite, so Key Foods has been a baptism by fire experience in NYC interpersonal interaction. My most memorable experience there so far at the 31st/Ditmars store: I paid with a $100 bill and the cashier was an older woman who was new, because she was really slow with the person before me and had to check the price of each item. She took my bill, said loudly, &quot;it must be payday&quot; and tried to check to see if it was counterfeit. Of course she didn&#39;t know what she was doing so she yelled to the cashier at the next isle, &quot;check this, I don&#39;t see the line, it may not be good.&quot; Everyone standing around could hear what was going on. Luckily the other cashier said it was good. Now that&#39;s how to treat a customer...humiliate them and risk them getting mugged on the way out because everyone now knows you&#39;re carrying cash! (I do know the risk for that is low in the middle of the day but still...)<br /><br />Plus, the organic stuff costs about twice as much as the west coast, too (Portland, OR, that is.)

				Today I was there for a handful of items. Middle of the day seems like a good time- well-stocked shelves; not too crowded.<br /><br />I got two types of tuna: The &quot;4 for $5&quot; and the &quot;99 cents each.&quot; Why two types? Because I had to prepare for the possibility that the sale only applied to members of the hoity-toity Key Food club. But they weren&#39;t marked as such.<br /><br />As I finished up, a cheery announcement: &quot;Checkout #11 is open! Repeat! There is NO LINE at #11! Come on over to #11!&quot; So I went and the cashier verified the tuna sale price for me. She also reminded me that I had two types of tuna and that they were different sale prices in case I didn&#39;t notice. That was cool.<br /><br />The rice milk, however, was leaky&nbsp; :? No big whoop, just finished up the old container and poured it in.<br /><br />Their Greek yogurt was expensive, but I found a more generic brand for half the price and twice the calcium further down the aisle.&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />

				I started this long post about cashiering and how much it sucks, and how we would get blamed for everything that went wrong in the store because, although most of the &quot;mistakes&quot; couldn&#39;t possibly be our fault (leaky milk=dairy stockperson not really doing his job), and how sometimes no matter how nice you are to someone, they&#39;re just going to treat you like crap ... but I deleted it because nothing excuses treating a customer badly, no matter how much they may deserve it. As a former cashier (6 very long years -oy), I would like to apologize to all you folks who get bad service at the grocery stores.&nbsp; I know it drives me crazy here, especially when I think about what I had to just sit back and take for fear of angering a customer.&nbsp; So on behalf of all grocery cashiers, I am sorry.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)

				I was in Key Food this afternoon. I couldn&#39;t believe what I saw. The cashier was literally yakking on the cell phone while ringing up groceries. And it&#39;s not like it was a serious conversation either, just a bunch of gossip. <br /><br />But here&#39;s the kicker, her mom was the customer in front of me. She rings up an item and because of the price the mom says she doesn&#39;t want it. But does she delete it? Nah, she proceeds with the order and after the mother notices the item still on there she sends her own mom to the customer service counter for the refund. <br /><br />Then over the loud speaker they tell her to take a break and she says she can&#39;t and proceeds to be exceptionally obnoxious to me while ringing up my order. The best part is the mother didn&#39;t say anything about her getting off the phone while at work.

				FreshDirect is totally the way to go.&nbsp; I&#39;ve only had small problems with them.&nbsp; Sometimes they forgot an item, or give you something you didn&#39;t order- but you just call up customer service and they credit your account.&nbsp; Or, sometimes they run mad late (especially in the rain); but again, if you call customer service, they&#39;ll usually credit your account for the delivery fee.&nbsp; But as far as selection and quality of food, FreshDirect is sooooo much superior.&nbsp; Good produce, great cheese selection, great meat selection, the fish is supposed to be good (never had it myself, but looking forward to trying it), and they bring it right to your door.&nbsp; What else do you want?

				Hear! Hear!<br /><br />Key Food does suck!! The produce is god-awful. Good thing I work near the farmer&#39;s market in union square so I am lucky. Next time you are at the checkout look at the floor, it&#39;s so gross it made me want to hurl!<br /><br />Last week I went there right after the gym at 10:45 just to grab a carton of organic milk and the little a**hole wouldn&#39;t let me in! He just laughed at me. Then the other night I had a teenage guy cashier and he was pleasant and fast, so go figure.<br /><br />So there are two other decent options: Fresh Direct or Best Yet. Best Yet actually has some decent produce and the prices are lower than Key Foods and it is so much cleaner and friendlier. I have made the long trek with my granny cart and bought a month&#39;s worth of food, so no car is needed.<br /><br />I just wish the health food store on 23rd avenue was cheaper.<br />

				Well to continue:<br /><br />Actually the THREE things that most rankle me are:<br /><br />1) They often don&#039;t have the advertised sale prices entered into their system.&nbsp; You have to pay attention (and know the sale prices), or you get charged the regular price.&nbsp; For me, yesterday, it was exactly twice the sale price.&nbsp; This seems to happen again, and again.&nbsp; The weekly advertised specials pull people into the store, but you will often have to put some work in to actually get the sale price - either get help at the self-check stations, get the checker to make the change, or haul you tail back in with your receipt to get the refund.&nbsp; Who manages this store?&nbsp; Why would it be so hard to go through the store each week to make sure the price changes are posted, and to go through the system to make sure they&#039;ve been entered?&nbsp; Pretty fundamental quality assurance.<br /><br />2)&nbsp; I&#039;ve particularly noticed in the produce section, especially in the high-priced organic produce, that there are frequently items without any display of unit price whatsoever.&nbsp; Apparently this display of prices is legally required - does anyone know more about this?&nbsp; You get to find out the price when you check out, or if you can use the price scanner provided for shoppers, BUT...<br /><br />3) They&#039;ve no longer got a price scanner there for shoppers.&nbsp; It&#039;s place is memorialized by a dangling cord right now.&nbsp; In the past, when I&#039;ve spoken to KF staff about how frequently the prices aren&#039;t posted, they&#039;ve pointed to the scanner and said that I can just use it to find out.&nbsp; That&#039;s of course not too convenient, and at least for, it was often hard to use.&nbsp; I could imagine lots of consumers, particularly older and disabled people, might have some trouble using it too.&nbsp; Maybe they&#039;ll replace it with a better one, but that&#039;s kind of beside the point.&nbsp; It shouldn&#039;t be such a project to make a consumer decision based on pricing.<br /><br />Does anyone have any ideas about consumers can have influence on their local grocery chain store?&nbsp; I realize that there are many people on limited and fixed incomes dependent on however Key Food chooses to run their store.

				Key Food never gets the prices right.&nbsp; There&#039;s always at least 1 - 3 items in my 2-3 bags full that are different from the advertised sale price.&nbsp; I&#039;m one to always buy from the sales, so it really irks me when they&#039;re not in the system correctly.&nbsp; I&#039;ve taken to purposely using the self-checkout kiosks because I can see all the prices as I scan the items, and can call over the checker to manually enter the price.&nbsp; Not all the coupons work, especially the self-printed ones from home, so I have to call them over for that too.&nbsp; At least they&#039;ll manually enter them for you though.&nbsp; Rite Aid refuses to help you whatsoever, and has lost a number of sales from me, whenever their machines refuse to read my coupons.&nbsp; If they were willing to just enter the numbers, they&#039;d actually make some money.&nbsp; Most times when I buy something it was because it was said to be on sale, or with the coupon, so if I find it&#039;s not, then I make them void the sale.&nbsp; Rite-Aid prices frequently differ from the advertised price, so bring the ad with you.&nbsp; But be prepared to void the sale, when they tell you the ad didn&#039;t mean that one particular variety but all the others instead.

It was definitely marked on sale - I read the description on the tag carefully, and this product was covered. It was one of those things like &quot;All Almay foundations and powders $7.99.&quot; Pretty clear, right? So I took it to the counter, and it rang up at the normal price. I said it was supposed to be on sale for $7.99. The cashier looked at me like I was crazy and told me it isn&#039;t on sale. I insisted that there was a sign saying it was on sale. She still disagreed with me, didn&#039;t offer to check or have someone look. So then I said I didn&#039;t want it if it&#039;s not on sale, and I left.<br /><br />And man, Key Food is such a rip-off. I can&#039;t believe how expensive this place is. The one on 30th at 43rd Street seems to be even worse than the Ditmars one, and it doesn&#039;t have express checkout. Kashi cold cereals are over $5, a jar of wheat germ over $7. Have these things gone up at the Ditmars Key Food too, or is it just this one?

				I live in the 30th Avenue area, but I usually do my shopping at the Key Food near Ditmars since I belong<br />to The Rock next door. It&#039;s easy for me to stop in there to pick up stuff and then just take the train 2 stops.<br /><br />I have to say I prefer the Ditmars one to the Newtown Avenue one by far. The Newtown location has less selection,<br />esp. sale items. Many times I&#039;ll stop at Newtown, like last night, and find they have nothing of a sale item, even though<br />the sale just started Friday. That&#039;s why I end up at Ditmars.<br /><br />I also have Tradefair near me, but for the things I buy&nbsp; -- Weight Watchers, Lean Cuisine, Kashi, Morningstar Farms, etc. <br />Key Food has more selection and sales on these items. Tradefair leans more towards ethnic foods that I&#039;m not interested in. <br />And Tradefair is too crowded and crazy - both Key Foods are easier to get around in since their aisles are larger. <br /><br />One great thing though with our neighborhood - at least you have choices, you&#039;re not locked into one store.<br /><br />

				I think Trade Fair is waaaay worse. It smells bad, the customers are awful, the cashiers are even worse. I&#039;ve had people step on my feet and grab things out of my hand and get in front of me in line. Cashiers refusing to get things locked up in the glass case cause they&#039;re too busy. Yeah there&#039;s a line but you shouldn&#039;t lock your stuff up, if you can&#039;t go and get it when someone needs the item. I&#039;ve usually had good experiences @ Key Foods. Some cashier and I started talking and I said I liked to cook and she gave me some recipes. It was really sweet of her. There are little old ladies that go in there and they&#039;ve politely asked me to reach for some things when they couldn&#039;t get it themselves. I feel good helping others. The people in the deli are always kind at Key Foods. Some of them even joke around with us when we go in. I will agree that their fruit is pretty bad, but you can always go someplace else for that.

				I most definitely agree with you there.&nbsp; The Trade Fair at 38th and Ditmars is way worse.&nbsp; Small, cramped, smelly, and dirty.&nbsp; The smell is just awful, especially since they hang dead bodies of animals in the back there.<br /><br />The deli guys at Key Food are often really nice, and some of the cashiers have been very friendly.&nbsp; It&#039;s the pricing mistakes that mainly bother me.

				I&#039;ve had pricing issues with Key Food, too.&nbsp; Drives me nuts.&nbsp; I try and watch as things ring up.&nbsp; I wish they had one of those registers that faces the customer, so you could watch the prices.&nbsp; When I miss them and then see it on the receipt, I don&#039;t want to go through the hassle of going to customer service, especially when I have frozen food in my cart.<br /><br />However, when I do catch issues, they are usually pretty good about correcting it.&nbsp; They might as me to run over to the aisle and bring them the price, but that&#039;s fine by me as long as I get my price.&nbsp; I like mama mac&#039;s idea, though.&nbsp; Then, I could do the work at home and just mail it off.&nbsp; Do you send the info to the store or always to the dept. of consumer affairs?&nbsp; Do they just forward the info to the store?

				So I went back to Key Food a day after the sale price error I wrote about above, bought something else, and checked to see if they&#039;d corrected the price in the computer system for the sale item.&nbsp; They hadn&#039;t.&nbsp; I asked the same staff person who I&#039;d reported it to, and she essentially said it was not her job, as did her supervisor, and they said that I should come back the next day and report it to the produce manager. <br /><br />I found this on the Key Food websites, a page with a form for submitting messages about specific stores: <br /><br />http://www.keyfoods.com/ContactUs.aspx<br /><br />I received an emailed reply from a V.P of Merchandising, cc&#039;ed to six other people, thanking me for my message, and requesting that I contact him directly with future issues/questions.&nbsp; He described how even if they were 95% correct with their sale pricing, that could leave 7 or 8 incorrect items, and that in the produce section, they receive so many items new to the system, that it was harder to ensure that they were in the system with correct information.&nbsp; He said that the supervisors would be in the store checking that the signs and labels were correct in the produce section.<br /><br />I&#039;m not clear why the work process can&#039;t include these steps:<br /><br />1) Each week, take the sale ad and just go through the store, checking to see that the sale signs are up.&nbsp; Then, check in the system that each sale price has been entered.&nbsp; Simple, logical quality assurance process.&nbsp; If you thrust advertising of sale prices into each home, you have an obligation to have those prices for the consumers you have lured with them to spend their money in your store.<br /><br />2) Whenever you put an item on your shelves, check that the signs and system labeling are in place - clear, visible and correct.&nbsp; Is there not a law requiring this?<br /><br />The next day after I&#039;d double-checked to find they had not corrected the price of the first incorrectly priced sale item, my partner was in Key Food to buy something else, also organic produce, that did have a sign for its sale price.&nbsp; Again, incorrect price in the system, which he caught at the register.&nbsp; He was not terribly comfortable while coordinating the correction, with a line of increasingly impatient customers waiting behind him for it to be figured out and corrected.&nbsp; Corrected for him that is - it doesn&#039;t seem like the staff understands any responsibility to follow up to see that corrections happen in the system or with the shelf signage.<br /><br />If you&#039;ve been frustrated with Key Food pricing problems, I&#039;d suggest copying the weblink above into your favorites and sending in quick reports each time.&nbsp; It&#039;s clear from looking back the several years through this thread that they have not seen cause to be much concerned with putting procedures in place to fix this problem.&nbsp; In this regard, they take their consumers for granted.<br />&nbsp;

				For what it’s worth, as a possible explanation, <em>not an excuse</em>, on why there are pricing problems at Key Food -- it may have to do with the fact that Key Food is a co-op, with individual stores or groups of stores owned by different companies. <br /><br />Key Food merchandising may do the buying, but it’s the individual owners who set the prices. Different items may be on sale at different Key Foods depending on who owns the store.<br /><br />Note, if you click on the link that round2 provided and then click ‘weekly circular’ you can see that each store has their own circular and though most stores have reductions on the same items each week, some do not. This is probably why the discrepancies are creeping in.<br /><br />Regardless, obviously, there’s a problem that needs to be sorted out in the computer systems.<br /><br />The Key Food on Ditmars and the one on 30th Avenue/Newtown are owned by Mandell Food Stores and a different response may be given if they are contacted directly:<br /><br />info@mandell.com <br />

				It looks like you got through to the right people then. Key Food -- can&#039;t live with them, can&#039;t live without them. Seems like they&#039;ve always had problems with differences between the circular prices and the prices on the shelves, even in the dark ages pre-computer scanning era. Thanks for keeping at them.

I avoid the back area of Trade Fair, the olives smell really bad and in the summer there are flies buzzing around. I never noticed the dead animals. It really skeeves me out when grocery stores have lots of flies in the summer time and lots of exposed food items. I went into a Super Fresh one time, not in New York, and there were flies buzzing around all the deli meats, it was so gross. One of the chicks in the deli @ Key Foods said she was buddies with someone who works at Trade Fair. She said never get the exposed olives from there because they barely change them, they just pile new olives on top of the old ones. She could just be talking smack but she admitted to buying other items from Trade Fair so I dunno. It&#039;s possible what she said is the truth. <br /><br />Yeah it&#039;s kind of a pain, I&#039;ve run into some pricing issues @ Key Foods too. They had a sale on beer once and it rung up as not on sale, but the lady went back, checked on the sale and reduced the price. For a long time every time I bought maraschino cherries @ Key Foods they always had to run a price check on them because they weren&#039;t in the system. They fixed the problem but it happened like 5 times. I&#039;ll still go there though because most of the employees have been pretty nice to me in the past. (I like that it&#039;s clean and the aisles are wide too.)

We&#039;re near the Ditmars stop, and so go to that Key Foods, but we get almost all of our (non-CSA, non-Greenmarket) produce at the greengrocer across the street. For those coming from East, Top Tomato on Ditmars is also good. You usually get better produce for 1/3 less money at a greengrocer than at the grocery stores.

				Key Food on 31st is a bit annoying in that they play games with the prices (sometimes strict about the amount you need to buy for the sale price, other times not.) If I&#039;m there for a whole bunch of other stuff and one vegetable, then I&#039;ll get that one vegetable there, but if I need more produce than that, I definitely go to Top Tomato.<br /><br />Some exceptions, like their avocados- they don&#039;t carry Hass&nbsp; :-o WTF?

				<br />Another pet peeve is sometimes it is unclear if you need to buy two of an item to get the sales price, so if you buy only one you pay the full price. Sometimes you can, sometimes you can&#039;t. Their sale signs on the shelves are confusing much of the time.<br />

				Yeah, the labeling in Key Food is problematic altogether. The labels aren&#039;t even under the correct items so frequently I&#039;ll grab something thinking that it&#039;s one price only to realize that the tag for that item is several feet away. This store is a mess. I&#039;ve started looking for many of the items I purchase in other stores locally because more often than not I&#039;m overcharged or there&#039;s some problem in Key Food.

				Lanseaux, maybe I was mistaken, but I could swear they werent Hass last time I looked. In any case, I hope they&#039;re Hass, and it would be even better if they were less than the 99 cents each that Top Tomato charges.<br /><br />I limit myself to certain staple items when in Key Food, and often ask about the sale prices when I&#039;m at the register just to verify what the conditions. They&#039;re fine for seltzer, sandwich bread, rolls, canned soup, half&amp;half, drink mixer, eggs, etc. Nothing fancy!

				Just had to go to Key Food for some quick groceries this afternoon. Got overcharged again.<br /><br />My total was just over $20, and they overcharged me on the chips I bought by $1, basically a 5% markup.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to start tracking how many times there&#039;s an overcharge on my receipts. I bet it&#039;s 7 out of 10 times I go there there&#039;s some error.&nbsp; :|

Key Food&#039;s selection of organic foods is neither great nor terrible, but it is horribly expensive, making it so pointless to buy things like organic produce there that they might as well not sell them ($5.99 for two organic green peppers? Yes). The non-organic produce is often not even good quality. This wasn&#039;t such an issue by Ditmars, where you have Top Tomato and Trade Fair along with the other places you mentioned, but it kind of sucks on 30th Avenue in the 40s, where the good produce places are 10 blocks away, the Trade Fair is 15 blocks away, and your only close grocery shopping option is the Key Food at 43rd Street. It is so depressing to go to this place, and to find just about everything I&#039;m used to buying for certain prices on Ditmars now costs $1-3 more.

				Key Food&#039;s organic products are pretty universally ridiculously expensive and the selection really isn&#039;t that great, though I was surprised to discover that the 30th Avenue/44th Street location seems to have more selection (albeit insanely overpriced).<br /><br />One correction about Trade Fair though:&nbsp; there is actually a Trade Fair on 30th Avenue just past 49th Street.&nbsp; So there&#039;s no need to trek all the way down past 31st Street to get to one.
