				(I think there should also be a tv show about politics in NJ&nbsp; :-o / NY/ DC ... . <br />Unlawful and disorderly)<br /><br /><br /><br />DOH-<br />&nbsp;:evil:<br />***<br /><br />http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20614865/site/newsweek/<br /><br />Fineman: Notes on New Hampshire <br /><br />The wooing of McCain continued. Giuliani impressed Romney’s people as well-prepared. And Huckabee won the Ron Paul lightning round. A rundown of the first fall GOP debate. <br /><br />By Howard Fineman <br />Newsweek <br /><br />Sept. 5, 2007 - Some observations about the state of the Republican presidential race after the Fox debate from the University of New Hampshire:<br />They came to bury John McCain by praising him, but in doing so they resurrected him—at least for a night. There was an air of nostalgia in praise other Republican candidates heaped on him. The shrewd Mike Huckabee led the way, saying McCain “understands the word honor.” Question: has the bidding begun for what everyone assumes will be a McCain postwithdrawal endorsement?<br /><br />Rudy Giuliani was better prepared than ever—at least in the view of the Mitt Romney campaign aides with whom I watched the debate here. He had plausible defenses of his liberal New York immigration policy, his lack of foreign-policy experience and his refusal to sign a no-new-taxes pledge. “He’s done a good job working on his answers,” said one of Romney’s top people here.<br /><br />Huckabee is a shrewd dude, and once again did himself good by focusing his folksy answers on big problems in a plausible way. He was especially smart to get into a shouting match with Rep. Ron Paul, the GOP’s isolationist libertarian. The Romneyans were jealous. They wanted to mix it up with Paul but didn’t get the chance.<br /><br />If Fred Thompson was watching, and I assume he was (he lands here in Des Moines on Thursday to launch his campaign), he saw nothing to prompt second thoughts about jumping in. No candidate was overwhelmingly powerful or potent.<br /><br />Former governor Romney for the most part seemed to disappear into the woodwork, except for a strong final answer on how he would approach decision making on whether to launch a strike against Iran. He got tough questions on tax policy, Iraq and other issues. “They’re treating him like the front runner he is in the early states,” said one of the Romneyans. Perhaps, but he seemed cautious and pallid, as though trying not so much to win support as not to lose it.<br /><br /><strong>Thanks to Paul, the debate over Iraq policy—and larger questions of presidential power and foreign policy—is far more robust than on the Democratic side.</strong><br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Based on what I am hearing here from voters and operatives here in Iowa, the Fox panel was right to home in on immigration. It is the hottest issue here.</span><br /><br />Sen. Sam Brownback, Rep. Tom Tancredo and Rep. Duncan Hunter are gaining no traction whatsoever, based on what I am hearing here and from soundings elsewhere. They did nothing to distinguish themselves in the New Hampshire debate.<br /><br />No one defended Sen. Larry Craig.<br /><br />Time to watch Thompson on Leno. <br /><br />URL: http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20614865/site/newsweek/<br /><br />(Is NH swarmed by illegal immigration?)

				<br />This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.<br /><br />SEAN HANNITY, CO-HOST: All right, it is time now for the final results from our text messaging poll.<br /><br />And in first tonight, Ron Paul. He is having all those 3 percent of people call in, I&#039;m sure. He got 33...<br /><br />ALAN COLMES, CO-HOST: Maybe he just did very well.<br /><br /><strong>HANNITY: He got 33 percent. Well, it happens. Anyway, in second place tonight, Mike Huckabee getting 18 percent. And taking the third spot is Rudy Giuliani getting 15 percent.<br /><br />Now I want to give you a quick — oh, by the way, fourth place is John McCain with 14 percent and Mitt Romney with 12 percent tonight.<br /><br />And taking the six spot, Tom Tancredo, Duncan Hunter both with 2 percent tonight.</strong><br /><br />Now I want to give you a special programming note, as you know, Senator Fred Thompson announcing that he will be entering this race and we will have a special interview right here, &quot;Hannity &amp; Colmes,&quot; our regular time, 9:00 Eastern, with Senator Thompson.<br /><br />And we will probably ask him some of the questions that were asked to the other candidates tonight. You know one thing that is emerging here, and I know you love the Democrats, there are distinct differences on Iraq, on immigration, securing the borders, on taxes, on health care, on education. There is going to be a very interesting.<br /><br />COLMES: Yes. And this will be good debate. And most — if you look the most of the polling, most of America is where the Democrats are, and certainly on the war — the War on Terror, the war in Iraq, how it is being conducted, how it is being fought, on education, on health care and a whole variety of issues.<br /><br />Interestingly enough.<br /><br />HANNITY: You sound like a campaign commercial.<br /><br />COLMES: Thank you so much. And I will send you a bill. But you know, Frank Luntz, earlier tonight in focus group showed that — and it did not show up on our text polling, that John McCain, according to the group he was with, did very well tonight than he has in previous debates.<br /><br />HANNITY: Well, sometimes — there is a natural ebb and flow to this. And as people absorb a little bit more of the interview, sometimes things change over time. I will tell you this, the debates — we are now in Labor Day. People are paying attention. They have expedited this process. We will have the caucuses and the primaries in January. And then we get into the interesting debates between the Democrats and the Republicans and those differences.<br /><br />COLMES: And that&#039;s when it gets really interesting. Then we see where America truly stands.<br /><br />HANNITY: Well, this is — I doubt it. But this is where.<br /><br />COLMES: Oh, well, we will see where America truly stands.<br /><br />***<br />?? we will see<br /><br />

				<br />http://richardreeves.com/about.html<br /><br />Came across a couple of interesting columns.<br /><br />http://www.uexpress.com/richardreeves/?uc_full_date=20070810<br /><br />&quot;Which candidate would do the best job resolving the war in Iraq?&quot; was one Rasmussen question. Sen. Hillary Clinton finished first with 20 percent of the total respondents.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;But the final tally indicated that 42 percent of respondents said Democratic candidates would do best and 41 percent said Republican candidates would do best.<br /><br />That confirmed for me, again, that the nation is polarized. Never underestimate the power of &quot;my party -- right or wrong&quot;!<br /><br /><br />http://news.yahoo.com/s/ucrr/20070907/cm_ucrr/whatunitespoliticiansbiggovernment<br /><br />&quot;WHAT UNITES POLITICIANS: BIG GOVERNMENT&quot;<br />&nbsp;:-o<br /><br /><br />***<br />I think big govt also unites voters. If the last 70 years are an indication.<br />United under a 2 party system.<br /><br /><br />I also want to ask if you believe that you personally should be taxed MORE or taxed LESS??<br /><br />Apparently a few believe they are not taxed enough.<br />It would be nice to have a Tax Me More Fund. Wonder how many volunteers there would be.<br /><br /><br />
