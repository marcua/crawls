				I&#039;m sure it does... rarely....<br /><br />But I can honestly say that 97.6% of the time, it is a young lady. <br /><br />Usually carrying a Starbucks or DD coffee, a book/magazine, Ipod and some kind of breakfast item. then it&#039;s a juggling act trying to fish out the Metrocard without spilling/dropping above listed items.

				I think the PSA referred to women specifically since RayG&nbsp; &nbsp;seems to be a male... and he claims he almost becomes TOO familiar... as in the biblical sense ... when he is dashing through the turnstiles.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think he was stating that men weren&#039;t also slow to swipe... just that HIS experiences were all with women.<br /><br />And hey, RayG..

				The same can be said for getting on a bus.&nbsp; Many times you wait 20 minutes for a bus and the people are griping about how long the bus is taking and then when the bus comes they are hunting for their Metrocard and the people&nbsp; behind them&nbsp; can&#039;t get on the bus so the bus can&#039;t move.<br /><br />It is similar to when people are on line at a fast food place griping about how slow the line is moving and then when it is their turn to order that is when they start to read the menu.&nbsp; Ugh!

				If for some reason I&#039;ve come a bit quick on a male, it&#039;s usually because the MC didn&#039;t take on the first swipe. I&#039;m usually keeping an eye out for that and the ladies with the MC still squirreled away. Just like at the EZ-Pass lane. I ALWAYS leave an out in case the idiot didn&#039;t read the sign that it was EZ only or has to go into the glovebox to get it out and hold it to the windshield.<br /><br />But sometimes the mind wanders thinking of other things, and THAT&#039;S when they get you!

				Yeah, this exact thing happened to me 2 days ago. THe train was pulling into the station and this young lady in front of me pulls into the turnstile entrance, unzips her purse, and begins searching through it for her card. By the time I get on the next line to get through the adjacent turnstile and run up the stairs the door closes. I would never even consider approaching a turnstile until my card was out of my wallet. <br /><br />The difference is being considerate vs. being oblivious.

				Same in DC.... They even have signs in the Metro reminding people to stand to the right.<br /><br />I typically find the &#039;left-standers&#039; in stations frequented by tourists: Grand Cent.,&nbsp; Times Square, etc. I figure they&#039;re visiting from places where therre is no underground transportation (or mega-crowds). If there&#039;s one in front if me I&#039;ll politely say &quot;excuse me&quot; and that person usually steps to the right or starts walking.

				I also hate when I&#039;m going down the stairs to a subway platform where there are trains going in two directions (say, one track headed to Brooklyn and one to Queens), and the people in front of you on the often too narrow stairs don&#039;t hurry or get out of the way when your train pulls into the station, because, what do they care?&nbsp; They&#039;re headed to Brooklyn.&nbsp; This is particularly bad at the staircase I use at 59th and Lex to take the N/W/R.&nbsp; Either hurry up, or get out of the way.

				Oh you&#039;d all be so proud (I hope) :-D :<br /><br />About a week ago, I&#039;d had a looong day at work and wasn&#039;t in the mood for thoughtless, inconsiderate commuters, so when trying to board the 6 uptown and the people by the door weren&#039;t moving in toward the emptier middle space, I spoke up and politely said &quot;Could we move in?&quot; and no one gave me any dirty looks, they all actually listened and moved around to accommodate the bunch of us trying to board!&#160; It felt great!&#160; Funny thing is, I immediately thought &quot;Can&#039;t wait to tell my fellow Astorians!&quot;<br /><br />I think that sparked a trend within myself.. the other day when coming up to QBP, the guy next to me wasn&#039;t budging even though he saw me eyeing the empty space to his right as tons of people tried boarding.. so I eventually said &quot;I think you&#039;re gonna need to move over&quot; and he did!

				On the subject of someone approaching others on the subway, I recently witnessed a woman on the train schooling three young men on the negative impact of using the &quot;n&quot; word.&nbsp; They - one Hispanic, one African-American, and one South Asian kid - were tossing the word back and forth and she informed them that it is a word that was used against her ancestors in a demeaning and hateful way (she is African-American).&nbsp; They looked sheepish and apologized.&nbsp; And they listened to her and she was able to engage them in dialogue.&nbsp; I thought it was a pretty great moment.

				Yes yes yes....<br />I&#039;ve taken to carrying a LARGE umbrella. It keeps me dry and I use it to push my way into the people who are standing in front of the doors shoving their way on the train before I get off.&nbsp; It&#039;s also somewhat useful at the turnstile when I&#039;m trying to get in (or out) and the folks on the other side just keep pouring through.&nbsp; Insert umbrella .... take turn.&nbsp; And.... those people at 59th street who are running from the 6 to the NWR platform... oh... you know them.... everyone is making their way down the stairs and then there are those who creep up along the sides of the stairs and jump in front of everyone.... if my umbrella finds some of their ankles.... well... so be it....&nbsp; &nbsp;So you see... an umbrella can keep you dry but can also help to mete out mucho satisfaction during a pushy annoying rush.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />Do I sound psycho? <br /><br />I&#039;m actually pretty careful to not bump people with the umbrella when I&#039;m using it as a shelter.&nbsp; I&#039;m on the tall side so I&#039;m always lifting it over shorter people and their umbrellas.&nbsp; <br /><br />Maybe I am psycho....&nbsp; i dunno

				nothing!

				Jennifer is right, alot of far eastern countries don&#039;t have the queue as part of their civil courtesy manners, still it annoys the hell out of me when I wait for people to exit the train first, while those behind me don&#039;t, and push their way ahead of me anyway. :?

				I respect your opinion regarding the &quot;far eastern people,&quot; but they are not the only people who cut in front of lines.&nbsp; I have seen plenty of other people from all different cultures, including Americans, not follow the common rules of courtesy on trains.&nbsp;<br /><br />And for the record, I am one of those &quot;far eastern people&quot; (although very American), who does not want to lumped into the stereotypes and generalizations.&nbsp; I try very hard to follow the rules, but I find myself in a losing battle.

				I hope nobody takes offense. I didn&#039;t mean &quot;far eastern&quot; as a stereotype, it&#039;s more of a cultural difference. Of course other people do it as well, but mostly it&#039;s those who weren&#039;t brought up in NYC culture and way of life.

				As someone who has used the subway in Japan, I can say that the lines to get on are impeccable, to the point where it kind of freaked me out the first time I saw everyone line up where the doors would be. It made me start doing it that way here, only to be disappointed when I was the only one in line.
