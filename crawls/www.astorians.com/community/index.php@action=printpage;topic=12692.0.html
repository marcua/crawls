				Anyone know anything about the new German place on 11th Street and 37th Ave?&nbsp; It&#039;s in the place that the Romanian place used to be. I saw some small signs on the front, it might be called Wunderbars.

				Hate to nitpick, but Schnitzel is Austrian. Austria gets lumped in with Germany way too often, but Austrian food is waaay better. <br /><br />Anyway, that&#039;s great that there&#039;s a German restaurant, but what a horrible location. Talk about off the beaten path.

				I was actually there for a German language MeetUp group last week.&nbsp; It&#039;s called the WunderBar German Grill and Bierhaus.&nbsp; Here&#039;s a link to their homepage:<br /><br />www.wunderbarlic.com<br /><br />As far as I know they&#039;re not yet quite ready for business yet but should be in about 2 or 3 weeks.&nbsp; Can&#039;t tell you about the beer selection since they didn&#039;t have their liquor license yet but the food received some good reviews from the Germans there.&nbsp; I agree that it&#039;s a bit of an odd location for any kind of restaurant but I&#039;m hoping that it does well.

				It&#039;s actually the location where Bulgara (http://www.bulgara-ny.com/index.html) was, although there&#039;s no indication on the Bulgara website that they&#039;re closed.&#160; It was a Bulgarian restaurant, not Romanian.&nbsp; There is a Romanian restaurant called Ion&#039;s Corner Cafe (http://nymag.com/daily/food/2008/03/ions_ups_the_romanian_ante_in.html) a few blocks away, which as far as I know is still open.&nbsp; It&#039;s at the corner of 36th Ave. and Vernon, across the street from the Roosevelt Island bridge.<br /><br />I ate at Bulgara once with a group from Astorians -- the &quot;mixed grill&quot; demonstrated an impressive variety of pork products, and the Bulgarian music videos on the largest TV I&#039;ve ever seen provided quite the entertainment.&#160; I&#039;ll be interested to see what beers WunderBar (groans on the name) carries.

				I also love the directions to the restaurant on the website: Take the F train to 21st Street, walk one block back towards Manhattan, take a right, etc.... It fails to mention that you would be walking right THROUGH Queensbridge Homes. And that 2 cops were just shot at the subway stop. Not good. The website should at least say to take the N/W to 36th Ave and then walk or take a cab.

				Thanks! doing my best, i enjoy reading all your post!&nbsp; sorry about the B-e-i-r spelling my webguy and I were rushing when he set the site up for the the German parade at the last minute,&nbsp; it first was Beer! and I told him to change it! true German Bier drinkers will see it is miss spelled, we got together and fixed the spelling.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />working my but off trying to make it a really nice place to go, we are getting close! the Bier cooler is up and running trying to finish the 8 Bier lines! and I have the menu almost finished.<br /><br />I use to be part owner of Lederhosen in the west village and ran the Hallo Berlin in Hells kitchen off and on for 8 years with my buisness partner&#039;s, my Grandfather is from Germany and owned a place in Glenndale Queens, <br /><br />for the menu - lets see basic at first! 11 kinds of wurst, 4-5 kinds of schnitzel, potatoe pancakes with apple sauce &amp; sour cream, imported herring, Rollmops, Weinherring in cream sauce, German fries w/curry sauce, Pretz w/ butter &amp; mustard, Imported Gurken (pickle), Imported Spaetzle with or with out Kaiser (cheese), Goulash, Kasseler Ribschen (smoked chops), Leberkaese holstein (egg on top), Roulade w/gravy, Hackbraten and so on! and if you have room! Apfelstrudel with ice cream &amp; German choc. cake for now! or maybe just a German Schnapps! menu will be on line end of the week. <br /><br />Ok break time is over back to prepping! <br />Danka! das is wunderbar!&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Went there this past Friday for lunch with my staff and partners. The food was first rate,the service was on spot and the beer was at its best, especially since the beers were brought in the previous day and the lines brand new. For all you Astorians who dislike the beer garden because it was over run by out-of-boroughers, you have found your new home.<br />Plan on going back this Tuesday and getting me Das Boot, and some more Wurst, cause they got the Best Wurst :-)<br />

				Went here tonight - excellent food, excellent atmosphere and excellent service. I really hope this place stays open. For those without cars, the neighborhood is a bit sparse but pretty safe during the day- although as a female I personaly wouldn&#039;t walk around at night.

				I also ate here tonight. came in at around 7pm, and we were the only ones there the entire night, till about 930. got some pretty good food - bratwurst, cheese spaetzel, schnitzel, potato salad. it&#039;s not as good as Zum Schneider in the LES, but the guy that helped us was nice and food was pretty good.

				Thought it was time for an update...<br /><br />A group of fellow Astorians and I went to Wunderbar last night and had a good time.&nbsp; It was fairly quiet in there for 7-9 on a Friday night but the staff said business is slowly picking up.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure its location is a bit of a turn off&nbsp; (37-10 11th Street) but they have some great specials and a lengthly menu that are worth checking out.<br /><br />Our group got the $45 platter of a variety of wursts which came with 2 sides - sauerkraut and red cabbage and potato salad.&nbsp; We also ordered the potato pancakes and the spatzle.&nbsp; Most of us enjoyed the food and we probably could have ordered a bit more since we had 8 people.&nbsp; In addition we went for dessert (all were $5) and the best comments went to the apple streudel which came with vanilla ice cream.&nbsp; I had the german choc. cake and others tried the choc. mousse and cheesecake - I&#039;d say they were decent, obviously from a bakery which is fine but I was hoping for something homemade.<br /><br />Service was great and they were very helpful explaining the menu items to us.&nbsp; I&#039;d definitely give it another shot as the atmosphere is unique and there is plenty of room in there.&nbsp; Lunch deals look great...wurst sandwich, side, and a beer for $12 though we forgot to ask if they have it on the weekends.&nbsp; Give it a try!

				I went for a beer Saturday afternoon and enjoyed it.&nbsp; I wonder if it gets crowded on a Saturday night?!?&nbsp; They close at 11:35pm 6 nights a week and 10:35pm on Sundays, so I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a last destination for people hoping from bar to bar.<br /><br />

				I was there last Saturday night and the food was delicious. I liked the selection of beers available and the ones I picked were very good. The only thing I would&nbsp; improve would be the bread that is served with the meal. It&#039;s not hearty enough for the wursts.

				We went Sunday - I had the Kasseler Rippchen (smoked pork chops). Very good. Three other parties there, and just one waitress/bartender/host, so not as festive as it must be when it&#039;s busier. This would be a great place to take a dozen rowdy friends, if I had a dozen rowdy friends.<br /><br />We&#039;ll be going back soon.. maybe I will make some new rowdy friends there.

				My better half and I wound up heading there after checking out that Dutch Kills joint (which to me, was overly pretentious and fairly annoying).&nbsp; Wunderbar is so awesome.&nbsp; We got a currywurst and cheese spatzele.&nbsp; Each of us downed a boot plus.&nbsp; I wish it were a bit closer to home, as it&#039;s kind of a hike, but it was a great time, and we&#039;ll definitely be heading back.

				I stopped in about 7:30 on Saturday evening. A sign on the door said that last call for food was 8:30 as there was a private party at 9 or 9:30. Funny, I had just checked out their menu on line and saw now mention. The bar was playing rather loud headbanger alternative music, which I found incongruous with the very German themed interior. I really didn&#039;t care but it was a little strange. The Met / Yankee game was on -several TVs- and there was a definite leaning towards the Yanks with the interior wall Yank pennants and player photos and the waiter&#039;s Yankee logo-ed shirt and cell phone holder ... really!<br /><br />I went with my gold standard of honest Teutonic sit down stick to your ribs fare: Sauerbratten. $16.00.&nbsp; I got the &quot;Big Boy&quot; 1 liter beer, I think it was like $11.00 (Imported, potent and took me all night to finish)<br /><br />It came with a kind of noodle side ( I really can&#039;t remember it&#039;s German name but it took up half the plate and was satisfactory.), a 1/2 slice of rye bread and a side plate of white and red saurekraut. The meat itself was tasty, but I&#039;ve had better. I found the beef to be vaguely soggy/spongy and the gravy, as I like it, was a bit thinner and lighter than I am used to and prefer. It wasn&#039;t horrible, I&#039;ve just had better. Maybe next time I&#039;ll try one of the &#039;vursts.<br /><br />To compare what I mean by a darker, thicker gravy ... Koliba on 23 Ave off of 31 St ... the Beef Goulash.<br /><br />http://www.kolibarestaurant.com/Main.php?do=Menu<br /><br />It could be a regional thing.. I like the more robust gravies with my Sauerbratten.<br />

				I finally got over there for a late dinner the other night and it&#039;s wonderful.&nbsp; The area is a bit remote and has a warehouse feel to it, but the inside of the restaurant is spacious and friendly.&nbsp; The food is very good, I had the kaesewurst and a chicken schnitzel and they were both wonderful, their tomato salat is also very good - nice ripe tomatoes.&nbsp; It&#039;s a bit pricier than I would have expected, but our party was very satisfied and we will all be back.

				We went with the family today for lunch. The space is great for kids because they can run around and play on the stage. The food and beer are great! We all had sausage platters. Love the curry sausage. The German cake was to die for. They were super nice to the kids and gave them a toy car and guitar to play with.

				Since my husband and I do not have kids we understand not bringing kids to a place they would bother people . That&#039;s why we went when they first opened and were gone before the customers started coming in. The in-laws and kids loved it!<br />
