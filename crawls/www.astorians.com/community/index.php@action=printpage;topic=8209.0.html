				I&#039;ve been to Anasa Day Spa for a massage, and other people on the forum had good things to say about their facials.&nbsp; On their website, it says that they&#039;re running a special for Spa Week: http://anasadayspa.com/.

				nope, no massage, sorry. Manicure/pedicure + facial - all good. The interior is beautiful... Booking ahead is the only problem, but worth the effort!

				I had a really nice facial at the new gym (club fitness on Broadway)... they have a spa inside.. really nice and they don&#039;t try to sell you products afterward unless necessary.. But i am not sure if the spa only accommodates gym members. Worth a phone call..

				I know it was months ago that I brought it up, but I finally got a facial at Anasa Day Spa and it went very well.&nbsp; Laura was my facialist, she gave me a clarifying facial and she was nice and pleasant and very good at her job.&nbsp; Offered great advice but didn&#039;t try to sell me a bunch of overpriced crap or tell me that I need to go in every 2 weeks for a facial.<br /><br />Really lovely facility, too.&nbsp; &nbsp;:mrgreen:

				I&#039;ve only had a mani/pedi there, but I would recommend Spa Hydra too. I was very impressed<br />with the space and the staff. I have a regular person I&#039;ve been going to in the city for 15 years for<br />facials, peels and brow waxing, but if something came up that she wasn&#039;t available and I needed my skin <br />cleaned, I&#039;d give Spa Hydra a try.<br /><br />And just FYI, booking ahead is the norm for appointments at day spas - I don&#039;t see why a previous poster would<br />say that&#039;s a problem. It&#039;s the same as a hair appointment - you don&#039;t just walk in and expect them to have<br />a free hour for you. I actually booked my mani/pedi appointment just a couple of days in advance w/Spa Hydra<br />and they were able to accommodate me. <br /><br />I&#039;ve also heard good things about Anasa but haven&#039;t been there yet.

				I just got out of an excellent facial from Anasa. They were super nice, it was clean and quiet and I felt great when I got out. <br /><br />I was too cheap to pay for the spa mani/pedi&#039;s so went over to Bamboo on b&#039;way &amp; 34th, they do a great $20 combo there (:<br />
