				I recently had to take my child to the emergency room. I&#039;ve had such negative experiences at the local emergency rooms (Astoria General, Elmhurst) in the past, that we decided to take the baby to the Komansky Center at New York Presbyterian. As usual, they were outstanding and made us all (including my child) feel at ease. I love that hospital and the doctors that I&#039;ve dealt with there, but its such a pain to get to when there is traffic or during the holiday season.<br /><br />We go to a pediatrician in Astoria who is affiliated with Flushing Hospital and North Shore. The pediatrician is OK, good for coughs and colds, and the regular shots, convenient location, but I wouldn&#039;t want them to care for my child with a serious illness-I just wouldn&#039;t trust them because they are not as thorough or knowledgable as the NY Presby doctors were. Does anyone know anything about the Flushing or North Shore hospitals and how they fare?&nbsp; They also seem very far away from Astoria. My experiences at the other ERs I mentioned above were bad because everything was rushed, overcrowded, not very thorough or seemingly scientific, dirty conditions, nobody seemed to care, and a large proportion of the staff didn&#039;t speak English and then to top it all off years of billing issues because someone at the hospital let the ball drop and didn&#039;t bill the insurance in time. Is this what I can expect at the other hospitals in Queens? I want to be prepared and informed should there (knock on wood) be another trip to the ER. Would love to hear your experiences.

				We had to take our 2 year old to Long Island Jewish Children&#039;s Hospital and can&#039;t say enough good things about it.&nbsp; Nice waiting area with individual cubes with televisions to distract the tots.&nbsp; Prompt, attentive service.&nbsp; A child-life coordinator who came by to visit and cheer our daugher up with a teddy bear.<br /><br />We use Astoria Pediatrics and have been happy with them so far.

				I couldn&#039;t agree more with you re: Mt. Sinai Queens ER- I have never had to take my daughter there, but I&#039;ve been there 2x, and it has been a disaster on all levels.&nbsp; <br />The one time I did have to take her to the ER, I went to NY Pres, and they were wonderful.&nbsp; Her pediatrician is affilated with them.&nbsp; If you are interested, I will give you the #- they are located in Manhattan, but just a few doors down from the N/W stop at 5th Ave, so it&#039;s still pretty convenient.<br />To answer your question, I don&#039;t know about Flushing, but North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset is an excellent hospital.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have any experience with pediatrics there, but multiple members of my family spent time in the ER growing up (we lived nearby), and my father was there for part of his cancer treatment.&nbsp; They have an excellent reputation.&nbsp; I would say it&#039;s a 20-30 min drive from Astoria, depending on traffic.

				The Pediatric emergency room at Booth is very good.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t recommend the hospital necessarily for a longer stay, but for emergencies like croup &amp; wounds needing x-rays, the staff is great and very fast.&nbsp;

				My experience with ER in Elmhurst was nightmare.We have to stay there with our 1 year old from midnight to 8am with fever 105.0 . They couldn&#039;t find the cause for fever so at 8 am they put a suppository and send us home. They did not care for the baby and they are called pediatricians..... Really bad.<br />So , thank you for having this topic. This way we can find out where to go in case of emergency and to get proper medical assistance.
