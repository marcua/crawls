				I went out for a walk after the rain stopped yesterday and saw that yogurt la crepe was closed.&nbsp; I guess they figured they wouldn&#039;t get much business on such a rainy day

				I love yogurt la crepe and am very happy that they opened on Ditmars.&nbsp; I see they are selling soup now.&nbsp; Hopefully that will help their business during the winter.&nbsp; In the summer they were very busy.&nbsp; I hope they could make it through the winter.

				I will definitely go back in considering your glowing review.&nbsp; My first impression was not good and we never went back.&nbsp; It looked a little too &quot;Willie Wonka&quot; for me.&nbsp; It was also in the summer and the crepe pans made the space feel like 100 degrees so I couldn&#039;t wait to get out.&nbsp; Vanilla Sky has a look more like a caf√© or coffee house.&nbsp; Especially the room in the back.&nbsp; They also have very good baked items.&nbsp; To me, it&#039;s the nicest in terms of atmosphere.&nbsp; I also like Fresk&#039;O on 30th.&nbsp; When Razzie&#039;s opens, I will plan to have pizza there and then try the yogurt next door.

				The thing I love about yogurt la crepe besides the yogurt is the outdoor seating area.&nbsp; It&#039;s so nice to relax outside in the nice weather and eat a frozen yogurt.&nbsp; It&#039;s always crowded in the summer and they&#039;re open late. Also they give you a card to get stamped every time you get a frozen yogurt and after 9 times you get 6 oz. free frozen yogurt

Fresk&#039;O is also good. Yogurt La Crepe&#039;s is OK but not as good as these other two. Still, they are better than that 32 Handles place by the train. One thing I object to at YLC is that the crepe griddles really heat up the interior in the summer, which I&#039;m not a big fan of.

				In the summer I always want to eat outside so if it gets too warm inside it doesn&#039;t matter.&nbsp; Most people with kids eat inside because the kids love to play with the tablets they have there.&nbsp; That&#039;s another nice thing about yogurt la crepe.&nbsp; The kids love it

On cold days, though, a warm space heated by crepe griddles sounds nice. I agree that it&#039;s very child-friendly there.
