				Sorry if this has been covered before.&nbsp; I&#039;m just curious.&nbsp; I&#039;m closer to the R right now.&nbsp; I have my R train friends and I have my N train friends.&nbsp; Sometimes, I try to have mixers to get the two together.&nbsp; It&#039;s hard work.&nbsp;

				If you can get on a train early enough to have a seat I never find it too bad.&nbsp; Its when its crowded AND I have to stand I hate it.<br /><br />Used to live on the R line, the Steinway stop.&nbsp; Not too bad, there&#039;s lots of alternatives in Manhattan that end up on that line in Queens, the V runs in the middle of the island, the R zig zags back and forth, the E shoots over to the West side, and if you&#039;re in Brooklyn and patient there&#039;s the G as well.

				I take whichever comes first (R or V) in the morning, but always take the V home at night. I think I have convinced myself that it is faster. Late night I take the N/W and walk the 10+ blocks up Broadway or if I am really lazy I take a cab from Broadway.

				N/W from the Ditmars stop. I enjoy having my own seat--unless I get there right before the doors close--and sitting with my book/mag/notes.<br /><br />Being that I grew up in the Midwest countryside, I am quite at home with the crowded streets of NYC, the diversity of Astoria, and the bustle of rush-hour subway rides.<br /><br />I guess I was just made to be here :-)<br /><br />=DuN=

				I take the N/W from 36th Ave. to work, usually have to stand until about 42nd Street.&nbsp; I work in Soho and get on the train to come back home at Prince so I usually have a seat on the way back.

				I live at Ditmars and take the train to 57th along with the many others.&nbsp; Of course, I also get on the train when there is a mass exodus of St. John&#039;s Prep kids in the morning.&nbsp; But most of the people in the last car with me get off at 57th, too.&nbsp; So it is nice to have a seat right next to the door and beat that rush there.

				The split makes sense to me.&nbsp; Think about it - posters on this board go to 36 Ave, Broadway, 30 Ave, Astoria Blvd and Ditmars to catch the N/W, but anyone who takes the R is either at the Steinway or 46th St stations.&nbsp; Less to choose from, and if you&#039;ve seen how packed Broadway and 30th can get in the morning, well - I&#039;ll buy that more people who consider themselves &quot;Astorians&quot; are riding the N/W train.<br /><br />I&#039;ve done both and lived halfway (really!) between the two lines.&nbsp; I can still take the R in a pinch, and sometimes I&#039;ll hop on the R, especially if I want to stop by Bravo or the Broadway library.&nbsp; If the weather is nice I might even take it home just to enjoy the walk, but if I&#039;m leaving from home I take the N/W.<br /><br />I do like the flexibility.&nbsp; With the way the MTA has been the past few years, it can&#039;t hurt to have backup options.

				I live about 2.5 blocks from the R train but it really does blow in the morning. I&#039;ll walk the extra 2-3 blocks just to take the N/W. <br /><br />With the exception that if I leave the house at 8:15, I can usually catch the R that arrives at 8:25ish at stienway. If it&#039;s raining, it&#039;s a toss up. If it&#039;s raining hard and I find my umbrella overpowered, i&#039;ll do the R. A milder rain will usually set me up for a nice stroll to the N/W. <br />

				I&#039;m three blocks from the N/W.&#160;&#160; Yeah, as a kid I lived for about 4 years under the rusty glare of the J train at Cleveland Street, where you could just look up from the second floor true railroad apt., and see the wheels and the sparks fly far closer to the Brooklyn digs than they do here.&#160; As a 10-year old kid I don&#039;t ever recall being roused from sleep by the train;&#160; sure, it was always there but you sort of put it out of your mind.&#160; The other day while walking below the south-bound N/W track I was speaking to someone.&#160; I could no longer hear what the person was saying when it was directly overhead.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know what it is about elevated trains that make people abhor them so much.&#160; It may be the rustyness of the metal, which actually would mingle with the rainfall and stain cars parked underneath the Brooklyn J.&#160; Here in NYC there&#039;s no great mystique like with the Chicago el.<br /><br />- Cannibal&#160;

				I like the elevated trains, but I wouldn&#039;t want to live right next to them or park a car under them, and I don&#039;t like walking under them either. But I like them because there&#039;s stuff to look at out the window, and in most weather conditions it&#039;s much nicer to wait for the train outside than in the underground stations. Only time it sucks is when it&#039;s pouring rain, when it&#039;s really windy, and when snow is piling up on the platform. Unfortunately in NYC the elevated lines seem to be associated with poor neighborhoods, which might be why they carry a stigma.
