				Welcome to Astoria!&nbsp; We have a large and growing LGBT community here in the neighborhood.&nbsp; A group of us have started a monthly dinner (now in it&#39;s seven month) and it keeps growing.&nbsp; We hit 56 in June and hope to surpass that in July.&nbsp; I&#39;ll be posting the details of the July dinner when we have them finalized.&nbsp; There is also a great bar up in Northern Astoria (North of the Grand Central Parkway) called Albatross, though we still need a gay bar down near Broadway, or at least 30th Avenue.

				What about Crescent Lounge? If that&#39;s not a gay bar, there must be another reason I have zero luck picking up men there....

				Crescent Lounge is gay-owned and operated (at least half of the ownership from what I understand), but not a gay bar per se.&nbsp; It&#39;s very friendly though, and good drinks!

				I really liked Crescent Lounge the one time i went there. It was super friendly and could go either way i think on being a &quot;gay&quot; bar.

				Oh, it&#39;s my favorite bar in Astoria. It has a nice atmosphere and some character, and the bartenders are really nice.

				Yeah, I had VERY strong drinks there for my birthday and am told I brought up a topic of conversation that I do not remember and that still embarrasses me when I think of it.&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />

				You can also volunteer for the GLAAD (Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) Media Awards. We have a good number of Astorians volunteering, though we can always use more! I am the Director of Volunteer Management at GLAAD, and an Astorian. E-mail me for more info.&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />

				You should have no problem meeting gay men. The OUT Astoria group is primarily composed of guys. The real problem is for gay women to meet more of the same. I&#039;ve noticed in the OUT member list there seem to be maybe 10 or so women and hundreds of men listed (from so many having obvious email names). It&#039;s a shame women don&#039;t get involved more.
