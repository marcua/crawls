				You can download a copy of the flyer below at http://www.worldcantwait.org<br /><br />COPY&amp;<br />DISTRIBUTE!<br />worldcantwait.org<br />YOUR GOVERNMENT, on the basis<br />of outrageous lies, is waging a murderous and utterly<br />illegitimate war in Iraq, with other countries in their sights.<br />YOUR GOVERNMENT is openly<br />torturing people, and justifying it.<br />YOUR GOVERNMENT puts people in jail<br />on the merest suspicion, refusing them lawyers, and<br />either holding them indefinitely or deporting them in<br />the dead of night.<br />YOUR GOVERNMENT is moving<br />each day closer to a theocracy, where a<br />narrow and hateful brand of Christian<br />fundamentalism will rule.<br />YOUR GOVERNMENT suppresses<br />the science that doesn’t fit its religious,<br />political and economic agenda, forcing<br />present and future generations to pay a<br />terrible price.<br />YOUR GOVERNMENT is moving to<br />deny women here, and all over the world, the<br />right to birth control and abortion.<br />YOUR GOVERNMENT enforces a<br />culture of greed, bigotry, intolerance and<br />ignorance.<br />People look at all this and think of Hitler – and they<br />are right to do so. The Bush regime is setting out<br />to radically remake society very quickly, in a<br />fascist way, and for generations to come. We must<br />act now; the future is in the balance.<br />Millions and millions are deeply disturbed and<br />outraged by this. They recognize the need for a<br />vehicle to express this outrage, yet they cannot find<br />it; politics as usual cannot meet the enormity of the<br />challenge, and people sense this.<br />There is not going to be some magical<br />“pendulum swing.” People who steal elections<br />and believe they’re on a “mission from God” will<br />not go without a fight.<br />There is not going to be some savior from the<br />Democratic Party. This whole idea of putting our<br />hopes and energies into “leaders” who tell us to<br />seek common ground with fascists and religious<br />fanatics is proving every day to be a disaster, and<br />actually serves to demobilize people.<br />But silence and paralysis are NOT acceptable.<br />That which you will not resist and mobilize to<br />stop, you will learn – or be forced – to accept.<br />There is no escaping it: the whole disastrous<br />course of this Bush regime must be STOPPED.<br />And we must take the responsibility to do it.<br />And there is a way. We are talking about something<br />on a scale that can really make a huge change in<br />this country and in the world. We need more than<br />fighting Bush’s outrages one at a time, constantly<br />losing ground to the whole onslaught. We must, and<br />can, aim to create a political situation where the<br />Bush regime’s program is repudiated, where Bush<br />himself is driven from office, and where the whole<br />direction he has been taking society is reversed.<br />We, in our millions, must and can take responsibility<br />to change the course of history.<br />To that end, on November 2, the first anniversary<br />of Bush’s “re-election”, we will take the first major<br />step in this by organizing a truly massive day of<br />resistance all over this country. People<br />everywhere will walk out of school, they will take<br />off work, they will come to the downtowns and<br />town squares and set out from there, going<br />through the streets and calling on many more to<br />JOIN US. They will repudiate this criminal regime,<br />making a powerful statement: “NO! THIS<br />REGIME DOES NOT REPRESENT US! AND WE<br />WILL DRIVE IT OUT!”<br />NOVEMBER 2 must be a massive and<br />public proclamation that WE REFUSE TO<br />BE RULED IN THIS WAY. November 2 must<br />call out to the tens of millions more who<br />are now agonizing and disgusted.<br />November 2 will be the beginning – a giant<br />first step in forcing Bush to step down,<br />and a powerful announcement that we will<br />not stop until he does so – and it will join<br />with and give support and heart to people<br />all over the globe who so urgently need<br />and want this regime to be stopped.<br />This will not be easy. If we speak the truth, they<br />will try to silence us. If we act, they will try to<br />stop us. But we speak for the majority, here<br />and around the world, and as we get this going<br />we are going to reach out to the people who<br />have been so badly fooled by Bush and we are<br />NOT going to stop.<br />The point is this: history is full of examples where<br />people who had right on their side fought against<br />tremendous odds and were victorious. And it is<br />also full of examples of people passively hoping to<br />wait it out, only to get swallowed up by a horror<br />beyond what they ever imagined.<br />The future is unwritten.<br />WHICH ONE WE GET IS UP TO US.<br />These next few weeks are crucial. This Call you<br />are reading has to get out to millions right away – in the<br />Internet, passed out as flyers and published as ads.<br />DO NOT WAIT! GET ORGANIZED!<br />Go to www.worldcantwait.org. Sign the Call online.<br />Get people together and make plans to be there on<br />November 2 and build for it .<br />That which you will not resist and mobilize to stop,<br />you will learn – or be forced – to accept.<br />MOBILIZE: NOVEMBER 2, 2005<br />Check worldcantwait.org for where to gather in your city.<br />MOBILIZE: NOV. 2, 2005<br />Drivers Wanted!<br />If people in the ’60s had limited themselves to only voting, lobbying, and volunteering, Black people would still sit on the back<br />of the bus and women would still die from back-alley abortions. Hurricane Katrina, the Roberts nomination, and the war on Iraq<br />cannot be stopped with “politics as usual.” That which you will not resist and mobilize to stop, you will learn – or be<br />forced – to accept.<br />Wednesday 11-2-05: a Massive day of repudiation of the Bush Regime, launching a movement to drive<br />Bush himself from office, and where the whole direction he has been taking society is reversed.<br />RESIST OR DIE!
