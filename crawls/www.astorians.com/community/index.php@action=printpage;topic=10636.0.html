				We start on Monday June 2nd at 7pm- a great way to learn how to play as well as improve your existing skills.<br />It&#039;s 15 weeks long and costs about $16 per week.&nbsp; This is a FUN coed league so no bad sports, please.<br />If you just want to check it out, stop by Break Billiards @32-04 Broadway next Monday and I&#039;ll be happy to tell you all about it.<br />Let me know if you are interested!!

				My cousin plays on that league.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think you left out the benefit of being able to play for free all week long, any day, if you are league member.&nbsp; Or did they stop that?&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s 8-ball and 9-ball league, right?

				Do you guys always play at Break Billiards.&nbsp; And is it $16 each week you play or the total (15 weeks x $16) amount upfront? <br /><br />I may be interested.&nbsp; It&#039;s near my apartment and I&#039;m not too bad.&nbsp; I have a friend who&#039;s been playing in a Manhattan league for a few years.&nbsp; She gave me a few handy tips that&#039;s helped my game a lot, but I&#039;m afraid I&#039;m a bit rusty right now.

				to answer both...<br />i believe with the APA membership ($20/yr) you can play free at certain times of the day.<br /><br />no worries about being rusty, this is a surefire way to get your stroke back.&nbsp; <br />This is really a learning league, I don&#039;t want &quot;great&quot; players, they usually create drama. <br /><br />In terms of the cost, we like the &quot;team&quot; to act as a team, so if you are absent more than you are able to come, the team will have to pay more which is unfair.&nbsp; <br />Stop by on Monday and I&#039;ll be happy to break it all down.&nbsp; I promise I won&#039;t make you join if you&#039;re not really into it :-)
