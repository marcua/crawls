				I&#039;m a little obsessed with Postsecret (http://postsecret.blogspot.com/), so I got a kick out of seeing this week&#039;s secrets (scroll about 3/4 down, look at the secret on the matchbook).<br /><br />(And no, I didn&#039;t write it. But I could have! Ha.)

				Pineapple - if you work near a bookstore, or find yourself having to kill some time in a B&amp;N or whatever, stop in and look at one of the 4 (!) Postsecret books that exist. (It&#039;s been around since &#039;05, and wildly popular.) So yeah, go to an actual store and poke through the books. It&#039;s a great way to kill some time, and people have this habit of leaving secrets in Postsecret books too - like, going to Barnes &amp; Noble and sticking a note in one of the books for sale. I found one once, and I put it back, since I wasn&#039;t buying the book :)

				I read PostSecret every Sunday and also noticed the Astoria secret. It is always nice to wonder who wrote the secrets or who they are about. <br /><br />I have loved this site for a few years now and it also helps that Frank Warren, the site creator, is a really nice guy. I went to a book signing of his at B&amp;N two years ago and he was just so friendly and down-to-earth. It makes me appreciate his site even more.

				erpotpwn - yay! that makes me happy to hear that he was cool. I used to work at a bookstore and we had some jerk authors come through for signings...like obviously they were fulfilling an obligation to the publisher and just couldn&#039;t be BOTHERED, but you don&#039;t have to be so obvious about it. I loved it when the authors were kind.<br /><br />I&#039;ve always wanted to go to one of Frank Warren&#039;s talks/slideshows, but they&#039;ve usually been at universities, and if there were any in the area, I&#039;ve missed them.

				Alison, not sure if you know but there is also a MySpace page where more secrets are posted each week. <br />http://blogs.myspace.com/postsecret<br /><br />Looks like PostSecret will be at St. John&#039;s in February but I am not sure if it is open to the public.<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve gotten the feed to my RSS feed aggregator (<span class="bbc_u">NetNewsWire</span> (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetNewsWire)) for a couple of years now. I love the stuff. Every now and then I have to stop and catch my breath because something is so sad that it deeply touches me. <br /><br />BTW, Frank Warren&#039;s books make a lovely gift for someone under the weather. They don&#039;t require a lot of concentration and give a great bang for the buck! I&#039;ve always gotten a terrific response when I gift someone in a hospital. And, yes, I once asked a friend to pick me up one of the books from B&amp;N near where they worked, and there was a note inside. I left it there when I gave it as a gift. (Of course, I read through it before I gift wrapped it!)
