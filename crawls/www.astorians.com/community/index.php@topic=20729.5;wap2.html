The lone Democrat now opposing the measure,Ruben Diaz Sr, is the Senate’s most vocal opponent of same-sex marriage and is not considered swayable under any circumstances.<br />The State Assembly, which is controlled by Democrats, has repeatedly passed the measure. <br />Mr. Cuomo called on Republicans to ignore pressure from leaders of the state’s Republican and Conservative parties and support the marriage measure. <br />“Represent the people of the state, not the party leaders,” he said. “Vote your conscience, not your fears.”<br />If the legislation passes, New York will become the sixth and biggest state in the nation to allow gays to wed. ]
