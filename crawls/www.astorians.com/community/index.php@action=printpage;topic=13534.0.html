				I&#039;m thinking about joining the Costco on Vernon Blvd (at the end of Broadway).<br /><br />Any recs on what to get (mostly food) that a young dude can reasonably eat or use?&nbsp; I heard the rotiserrie chicken is an awesome deal.

				We go there with friends and we always load up on toilet paper, tissues, paper towels, garbage bags, pasta, olive oil, cereal, cat food, cat litter and all kinds of soaps (dish, laundry, even shampoo). <br /><br />The large quantities make everything significantly cheaper in the long run, provided that you have a bit of storage space available in your apartment.

				I have HUGE closets, so I stock up on all the non-perishable items from there. In addition to the stuff that paratactical already mentioned I also buy aluminum foil and plastic wrap in bulk. <br /><br />I buy my calcium and vitamin tablets at a great cost savings. <br /><br />If you have refrigerator and freezer space their frozen food section is like a fairyland. The frozen shrimp, vegetables and some prepared foods are sold at terrific discounted prices.<br /><br />But my favorite buys are the meats, fresh fruits and vegetables, and the bakery products. As soon as I get home, I repackage everything for the freezer. I am not a young dude, errr, ummm, I am an old dudette who lives on a fixed income. Wherever I can conserve my budget I avail myself of. Costco has been a great asset in my life. I learned not to buy on impulse just because something is a great bargain. You need to understand what you will really use so that you don&#039;t have to throw away spoiled foodstuff because you bought too much.<br /><br />The VERY BEST BARGAIN at Costco is their pharmacy. Their prices are minimally 45%â€“70% cheaper than any other local drug store and the products are identical.

				Yeah, I go shopping there with a friend of mine and I&#039;m trying to teach them to not buy perishable stuff in bulk. <br /><br />I really wish I had more storage space or one of those tall freezer units.&nbsp;

				everything everyone else said plus their rotisserie chicken IS delicious.&nbsp; Also their french bread.&nbsp; YUM.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also gotten their pesto sauce, mango salsa for chips, and their shrimp cocktail platter.&nbsp; Everything I&#039;ve ever gotten there, food wise, has been really good.<br /><br />AND you can buy socks, books, CDs, DVDs, appliances (all of which I purchased at one time or another).&nbsp; Sometimes I find things there for such a great price that I can&#039;t find anywhere else that I always end of rejoining.<br /><br />Costco is great.

				Do they sell liquor at this Costco?&nbsp; I was a member there years ago but they didn&#039;t have it then so I figured I&#039;d ask since I&#039;m contemplating joining again.<br /><br />Also, do you still have to take your own bags there to haul everything?

It&#039;s one of the ways they keep costs down. (And, when I lived in Europe all the big supermarkets did the same thing to help eliminate the use of plastic bags. But then, some countries also threw you in jail for a weekend for feeding pigeons!)

				Don&#039;t forget the big ass tub of Sabra Hummus.<br />All the veg and fruits are top notch quality.<br />Cheese are very very good with some surprisingly high end product.<br />Smoked salmon is mostly Acme but under the Blue hill name.<br />Love the meat selection and yes the roast chicken rocks.<br /><br />The liquor store carries premium wines and booze at good pricing.

				Its great for things you use a lot of. If you are single, you should definitely consider sharing the membership with someone and maybe splitting the stuff you buy. Their meat and veggies are very fresh-but honestly, whenever I buy fresh stuff from there part of it ends up going bad because we just can&#039;t eat it all. Cleaning supplies, vitamins, ibuprofen, shampoo, meds, batteries, office supplies, frozen foods, coffee, cereal are great buys at Costco though. You can also find nice gifts there and seasonal items too. Nice ready made platters or cook at home items as well. Good place to buy food when you are having a party.

				they have vizio&#039;s, but i believe they have other brands as well- pretty sure i&#039;ve seen sharps and samsungs. a lot of the big box stores sell things like big screen tv&#039;s, dvd, etc. at cost or even a loss in the case of cds / dvds to get you in, so you don&#039;t get as good a deal at costco as you would for other stuff.<br /><br />bought the &quot;buffalo chicken dip&quot; last week, and it&#039;s amazing.
