				Check out Dr. Muataz Jaber.&nbsp; His address is 31-11 31st St.&nbsp; He also has an office in Rockville Center.&nbsp; His number is 718-784-7680.&nbsp; I go there for allergy shots.&nbsp; He is very friendly and knowledgable.&nbsp; Don&#039;t know what insurances he takes but I do know he does accept insurance.&nbsp;

				IMHO, your daughter would be best served by seeing a Pediatric Pulmonologist until it can be proven that her asthma is a direct result of allergies.

				We have an excellent allergist group but they are located in Manhattan at the Mt. Sinai Hospital.&nbsp; I know you are looking for one in Astoria but they are very good.&nbsp; They work with the parents and the kids are very comfortable there.&nbsp; They are a full team that take insurance and are extremely thorough.&nbsp; My son has severe life threatening allergies and also has asthma.&nbsp; The team of doctors and nurses are very knowlegeable and I receive allergy testing and then emergency action plans once per year.&nbsp; They are allergists and immunologists so they take care of all our needs.<br /><br />Here is their information:<br />Mt. Sinai Pediatric Allergy (all the doctors are great - the most well known is Dr. Sampson (he is known across the country).<br />212-541-2248<br /><br />Here&#039;s our doctor: http://www.mountsinai.org/Find%20A%20Doctor/profile.do?id=0000072500001497231432<br /><br />Good Luck!&nbsp; Before my son was on the proper action plan, we had many visits to the emergency room during the cold winter months (some even in the middle of the night) because we could not control it.&nbsp; Now that he is on his medication and all his food allergies are under control, we are able to monitor it.
