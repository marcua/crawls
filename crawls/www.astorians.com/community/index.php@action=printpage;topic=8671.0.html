				Is Kid Krazy (http://www.insiderpages.com/b/3719044226) the school you&#039;re referring to?&nbsp; If so, here (http://kidkrazypreschool.com/) is the website of the school itself.&nbsp; Unfortunately I have no personal knowledge of it.

				There is a new one; http://www.happydayschildcare.net/index.html that my husband and I took a tour of...if we didn&#039;t have a great nanny and nanny share we would have gone with them. Met one of the owners and she is just really nice. Was very impressed with the facility but especially her. I would say check them out. Don&#039;t know anything about Krazy Kids. In any case, best of luck and welcome to the neighborhood.

				Two years ago I checked out Kid Krazy after being really really impressed by the owner, who had taken the children to the playground while I was there with my 18 month old.<br /><br />Good things: The owner is fantastic, the toys are cool. Also, they didn&#039;t freak out if the kids weren&#039;t potty trained, and made sure everyone went to the bathroom and were clean before their folks picked them up.<br /><br />Bad things: the area for the 2-3 year old set (which had been very spacious) got cut in half a little over a year ago so that they could make room for a group of even younger kids. I haven&#039;t visited again (my son was too young, and then the times weren&#039;t as convenient for me as the place i ultimately ended up with), but I would definitely check the physical space out before you commit.<br /><br />Other things: The number of childcare options around here have really increased in the last three years. There&#039;s a Montessori school that I believe starts at 2 yrs, if you&#039;re interested in them, located next to Astoria Park. (Blossoms, I think they&#039;re called...) Have you checked out the Astoria Stay At Home Moms&#039; MeetUp? They can be a good source of info.

				I checked out Krazy Kids and Les Enfants Montessori School and chose the latter.&nbsp; The price was comparable but Les Enfants were doing more with teaching the children. Here&#039;s the link. Good luck<br />http://www.lesenfantsschool.com/

				I have my daughter who is almost 3 years old in Kid Krazy. I can&#039;t recommend the school enough. I had visited many schools in the area including Montessori, which a parent had told me some not great stories about... My daughter who was extremely shy just blossomed at the school and can&#039;t wait to see her teachers and friends every morning. The Director is fantastic,when I had first visited the classroom with her, all the children came running to her and gave her a hug. She genuinly cares about the children and was extremely patient and understanding with my worries. My only regret is that I didn&#039;t know about Kid Krazy when my son was preschool age. Kid Krazy is definitely worth visiting.

				Actually the original person who posted the question about the preschool was in error... She had written Krazy Kids... but the correct name of the preschool is Kid Krazy... Their motto is... We are Krazy about our Kids... There is nothing &quot;poopy&quot; about that... They are... and I am gratefull to them for it.

				Hey everyone,<br /><br />I just changed the subject line to reflect the correct name of Astoriamom&#039;s daycare, although the idea of a daycare called Krazy Kids was pretty amusing to me for some reason.<br /><br />Moderator<br /><br />Astorialuv

				Why do school setter-uppers (founders? I don&#039;t know the term) insist on spelling the school name in a wacky and incorrect fashion. That could be a child&#039;s first introduction to the written word, and they now think that crazy is spelled with a K. To me, <em>that</em> is krazy.&nbsp; Sure, the repetition of the letter K is sort of cute, but come on!&nbsp; There was preschool near where I lived in CA called Pla-Skool in the Pines. Are you kidding me? I&#039;m sure these schools are lovely and well-run, but shouldn&#039;t an educational facility spell its name correctly?&nbsp; :ticked:&nbsp; This is a major pet peeve for me. <br /><br />Yeah, I do see the irony of someone who posts about &quot;setter-uppers&quot; whining about school name spelling, but you see where I&#039;m coming from right?<br /><br />Sorry, rant over.&nbsp; :lol:

				My 20 month old will be going to Kid Krazy in September on a full time basis.&nbsp; Like a paranoid mommy that I am, I am now obsessing over her lunch and snacks.&nbsp; What do you guys pack for you little ones?<br /><br />

				Hey, <br />Does anyone else on the board have experience with this day care? I am going to check them out but I wanted to know what parents have to say -- any negatives to be aware of? Feel free to PM if you don&#039;t want to post to board. Thanks!
