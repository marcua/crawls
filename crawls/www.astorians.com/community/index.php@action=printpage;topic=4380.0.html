				I don&#39;t know if anyone else has had problems with Microsoft, but I have had it with them.&nbsp; The other day, for no apparant reason, all of my MicroSoft products started to fail on my computer.&nbsp; Nothing seems to want to work.&nbsp; I called the manufacturer of my computer, since it is pretty new, and was on the phone for&nbsp; an hour and a half.&nbsp; After all is said and done, they couldn&#39;t help me.&nbsp; They told me since nothing has fixed the problems that i should reformat my hard drive.<br />Before I go that drastic, I figured let me call MicroSoft, since it is their products that aren&#39;t working.&nbsp; I just got off the phone with them and that call only lasted about 3 minutes.&nbsp; First they won&#39;t let you explain the problem in detail...they want you to give a 1 sentence description.&nbsp; After I try to explain the problem, they tell me that because the manufacturer of the computer installed the programs, that I would either have to call them (I did already) or pay for tech support.&nbsp; PAY for Tech Support???&nbsp; &nbsp;Their programs F up (and only their programs) and I have to pay to have them tell me the same thing...reformat my hard drive....I don&#39;t think so. <br />I have had it with MicroSoft.&nbsp; I think I just might try out Lynix and other such programs.<br /><br />Sorry to go on like this...but I really needed to vent...Everyone..have a good day&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				Yep, system makers (Dell, say) are good on hardware support, but not so good on software. Microsoft (the &quot;s&quot; hasn&#39;t been capitalized in like 25 years!) doesn&#39;t support their products unless you pay them for support. I&#39;d recommend 3rd-party support, like Geeksquad (or a locally owned alternative), or Google... <br /><br />What&#39;s the problem, incidentally?<br />

				No Microsoft (no capital S) programs will open.&nbsp; A Window Installer window pops up, but nothing is installed.&nbsp; I try to uninstall Microsoft Office and it won&#39;t let me and I can&#39;t reinstall it untill I remove it.&nbsp; When I go online with Internet Explore and try to download updates or anything that might work, the computer crashes.&nbsp; If I use Mozilla, I can download stuff, but nothing has helped.&nbsp; I have updated my ActiveX and Java and still nothing.&nbsp; Incidentlly, the only other program that isn&#39;t working is Norton..yup the antivirus.&nbsp; I have to wonder.

				I have tried everything.&nbsp; Speaking with a co working, I am leaning toward a virus.<br />When I say it won&#39;t let me uninstall...it means just that.&nbsp; It won&#39;t allow that function to work.&nbsp; As for the crashing...the program just hangs in Limbo.&nbsp; I have to go into task manager to clear the window.

				Getting a Mac is NOT the answer. OS X is nothing more than a restricted version of Free BSD and is just as restrictive from a licensing standpoint as Microsoft&#39;s EULA. By using either of these operating systems, you&#39;d be accepting (and therefore, promoting) technologies like Digital Restrictions Management (DRM) and Trusted Computing (TC) that threaten all of our freedoms.<br /><br />Any one of the following URLs can provide more info:<br /><br />http://fsf.org<br />http://gnu.org<br />http://badvista.org<br /><br />In a nutshell, the best long term fix to these problems is to start using and advocating Free Software.

				Well this surely can&#39;t end well...<br />IMHO, one of a computer scientist who has studied this and has also read enough slashdot threads on the subject to be certified, is a member of sourceforge, freshmeat, etc.&nbsp; Free software is not the sole answer, it cannot survive on it&#39;s own.&nbsp; It is also not a viable solution long term or short term for certain individuals.&nbsp; Case-in-point myself.&nbsp; I work in a rapid application development environment and our weapon of choice is visual studio and the entire MS suite.&nbsp; For reasons I won&#39;t go into, there is no better option for the situation we are in.&nbsp; I&#39;m saying this after a history of using nothing but open source and non-MS solutions from college to previous work environments.&nbsp; I did a complete 180 and I&#39;m happy I made that choice.&nbsp; The same goes for my graphic designer roommate, she it happily married to her Mac.&nbsp; <br />I love pay-for software.&nbsp; It&#39;s a product, it serves a purpose and I&#39;m happy to pay the price and suffer under some of the licenses.&nbsp; Yes, there is still work to be done as far as DRM goes.&nbsp; And yes, I also love open-source and free software but it alone can and never will fulfill my needs.&nbsp; Unless it&#39;s an open source fem-bot, then we might be in business.&nbsp; <br />And last time I checked, FSF and other free software enterprises require donations to survive.&nbsp; How different between paying a fee and paying a donation?<br />Sometimes getting a Mac is the answer.&nbsp; And there&#39;s nothing wrong w/ a restricted Free BSD.&nbsp; How many people out there do you think even know what we&#39;re talking about?&nbsp; Most unix admins don&#39;t know how to secure a box, it would be careless to ship OS&#39;es with full exposure.&nbsp; <br />Maybe one day after people stop poisoning themselves with trans-fat they&#39;ll pause to reflect on their EULAs, but until then, you&#39;re going to have to fight the good fight for the rest of us.<br />Humbly,<br />Josh

				As a less-knowledgeable, computer-interested and using individual who doesn&#39;t know much about the specifics of programming, I don&#39;t think these FSF groups will ever succeed. The reason I think this is because as a consumer, I don&#39;t mind paying for my Apple programs. I think they&#39;re not as evil as Microsoft; their stuff works; it&#39;s pretty and it doesn&#39;t make me have to learn code to make my computer have a picture of a kitty on the background or surf the internet. <br /><br />I&#39;ve tried to get into shareware and use them intelligently, but I don&#39;t know enough about it and any guides online are not written for people who don&#39;t understand computers very well. <br /><br />If groups like Gnu and BadVista want to be successful they have to get up FAQs that explain not only why what they&#39;re doing is important but why it&#39;s better for me, the consumer, to go with their product. Aside from the pricetag, they need to seriously address compatability and useability issues.<br /><br />I mean, I like to think I&#39;m smarter than the average Joe, and I&#39;m still intimidated by all the technical jargon that gets thrown around and that seems nessecary to really be a part of the freeware nation. It&#39;s too much like an exclusive club and that won&#39;t succeed. One of the reasons why Mac and Apple products are awesome and successful is that you get to feel like you&#39;re part of an exclusive club, but anyone can be a member once they jump on board. These freeware groups don&#39;t seem to get that.<br /><br />But like I said, I don&#39;t know much about programming, so I don&#39;t even understand the possible advantages. It&#39;s just a shame they don&#39;t try to explain them better.

All too often, your average CS major is far too obsessed with the idea of showing everyone how informed they are by speaking in acronyms and jargon but yet never understanding what the terms actually mean. In other words, a few CS classes doesn&#39;t really qualify you to speak on the subject any more than anyone else. Especially when you&#39;ve provided no qualifications with regards to what exactly you studied. As you surely know, anyone can become a member of a website. What FSF issues have you &quot;studied&quot;? What experience do you have managing systems? How have you studied the ill effects that software patents have on startup companies and individual developers? I could go on and on but I hope you see where I&#39;m going by now....<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=4380.msg44858#msg44858">Quote from: Josh on December 22, 2006, 02:30:37 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />&nbsp;and has also read enough slashdot threads on the subject to be certified, is a member of sourceforge, freshmeat, etc.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />uh... so reading /. qualifies someone to speak on the Free Software Movement?

You need to define the word &quot;survive&quot;. If by &quot;survive&quot; you mean, that its development can not be sustained, you are mistaken. As long as people have problems that can be fixed with software and people have the freedom to fix those problems, free software development will continue. If on the other hand, you mean something else by your use of the word &quot;survive&quot;, you&#39;ll need to elaborate. I suspect of course, that you&#39;re probably confusing a few things are actually trying to say that a business model that is compatible with the agenda of the Free Software Movement can&#39;t survive.

The BSA will pay them a nice friendly visit.<br />2. Microsoft will revocate their products due to legitimate or suspected failure to comply with one or more specifics of the EULA.<br />3. Every computer in the company belongs on some 15 year old&#39;s botnet <br />4.

They simply do not prevent someone from hijacking the code, making a few modifications, and then redistributing it under a freedom-restricting license. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=4380.msg44858#msg44858">Quote from: Josh on December 22, 2006, 02:30:37 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> How many people out there do you think even know what we&#39;re talking about? <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This disgusts me.

Over and over again, the CS major just throws in ad hoc statements that sound important but yet, have NOTHING to do with the topic at hand. Of course, this will often work when the CS is speaking to another CS but not here. If you&#39;re going to engage me in this discussion you&#39;re going to have to do a better job of making your point (hell, make A point at least) and staying on track.<br /><br />

				Stop the madness! Seriously, can&#39;t people disagree without being so harsh? Come on. Neither one of you is a filthy ignorant pig from hell. <br /><br />If progress is to be made, it really has to start with mutual respect. And just because someone doesn&#39;t see things the same way, was born without your very impressive IQ level, doesn&#39;t have access to the same information as you, has drawn different conclusions, etc etc., doesn&#39;t mean they are beneath contempt. They are just different. And that is OKAY, for crying out loud. <br /><br />It&#39;s clear that you are both intelligent to offer us all a very interesting and informative discussion if you can hold off on the hair-pulling and eye-gouging.

While the Windows bundle issue is certainly of great importance, it is only a very small piece of a much larger picture. On that note however, I really have to laugh when you say that you know exactly what you are getting when you use Windows or OS X. That is exactly the point; you do not know what you are getting because you are not legally allowed to know. What you get is a black box that you feel comfortable using because you&#39;ve been using it for so long. <br /><br />Secondly, it&#39;s not about numbers. Are you nothing more than a sheep that blindly follows the masses regardless of what is ethical? The free software movement, like all great revolutions started with 1 man. That man of course is Richard Stallman. I, as well as millions of people are in debt to this man for having the conviction to not even bother wondering what &quot;everybody else was thinking&quot; and instead, focused on solving a growing problem. That problem still exists and is more threatening today than it was 15 years ago. However, we are making progress.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=4380.msg45091#msg45091">Quote from: Josh on December 28, 2006, 11:27:59 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">You continue to forget that for computers to be made available to EVERYONE they have to be understood by everyone.&nbsp; Giving people who have no capacity for this is taking away from their user experience.&nbsp; Let&#39;s face it, even people on your side, people who truly know you call you out for being overly pompous.&nbsp; <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />And you (the CS major...lol) are making it very clear that you believe people are so idiotic that they ONLY thing they can understand is a START menu assisted by a googly-eyed dog that wags his tail when &quot;it&quot; searches for files. Oh please, spare me!<br /><br />Is that all you learned in college? How to be a slave to a START menu and follow wizards around blindly? So much for that education...lol. Yea, I can really see that you, a CS major, really understand computing. Good luck with that buddy...<br /><br />Us professionals however (y&#39;know, the ones who actually make a living working with this stuff) know the following:<br /><br />Interface != Understanding<br /><br />That simply means that no single interface represents the computer or the computer&#39;s capabilities. The interface is simply a layer that sits between the computer and the end user. In Windows, the interface is fairly well understood due to it&#39;s dominance in the home market. By now, most people know how to use things like dialog boxes, buttons, menus, icons, and other trivial aspects of the overall experience. That of course, has nothing to do with software freedom. Many free operating systems and applications can be used by these click happy users while still providing the end user with the freedoms to redistribute, modify, and study the software in question. In other words, your comprehension of a computing experience has NOTHING to do with the issues I am discussing.<br /><br />To make my point, let&#39;s suppose I took a computer, slapped OpenBSD on it, and then installed a GUI interface and configured the interface to look just like XP. You&#39;d feel right at home and wouldn&#39;t even start rambling any of the nonsense you&#39;ve been blabbering all over this thread. The reason? You wouldn&#39;t feel threatened by having to learn something. In other words, your desire to be lazy would be satisfied. It is painfully clear to me that you do not care about freedom as it relates to software, the overall effect of freedom-restricting software on society in general, the fact that proprietary software forces us to reinvent the wheel over and over again out of fear of violating a patent, or the fact that proprietary software creates a digital divide (the haves and the have nots). All YOU care about is staying within your personal comfort zone. The motive is self-centered, short-sighted, unethical, immoral, and not worthy of my respect.<br />

You justify your digital slavery because Microsoft includes a &quot;driver&quot; (in GNU/Linux, hardware is actually supported by kernel modules) for you????? Some of us realize that what&#39;s actually happening here is ....... get this............ Microsoft is ALLOWING you to use a specific piece of hardware.<br /><br />pathetic!<br /><br />As for Linus, he&#39;s a fool. He has far too much air time and nothing important to say with it. Richard Stallman is on a completely different level and shouldn&#39;t even be mentioned in the same thread as Linus.
