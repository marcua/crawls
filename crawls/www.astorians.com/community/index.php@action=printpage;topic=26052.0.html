				When I searched for auto insurance ~5 years ago, I found Geico to be significantly more affordable than any other carrier. Thankfully, I haven&#039;t made any claims so I can&#039;t speak to their service in that regard.

				UPDATE<br /><br />does anyone know anything about http://www.newyorkmotorinsurance.com ?<br /><br />i just filled out their form online and an agent immediately called me and gave me a $45/month quote.&nbsp; this was cheaper than anything I ever expected, but are they legit??

				Hi,<br /><br /><br />I just went through this process and ended up going with State Farm.&nbsp; Their prices were significantly lower than Geico and others and for solid coverage.&nbsp; I recommend doing the online quote and saving it, then calling them after also speaking to Geico or Progressive - they will undercut the lowest price when you speak via phone so good to have gone through the legwork a little.&nbsp; <br />All best!

				I doubt State Farm is cheaper, I shopped around a lot when I was younger and even now that I&#039;m older and Geico/Progressive have been the cheapest by far.

				No matter which one you go with, don&#039;t skimp on the coverage. Saving money in the short term won&#039;t help when they come after YOU for the money for medical expenses when your coverage is a pitiful amount.
