				Something happened in the toaster oven making world in the last few years - apparently they forgot how to make them.&nbsp; Maybe like everything else they got cheaper and crappier and now they are disposable like so much else.&nbsp; <br /><br />I need to buy a new one - I have only heard from disgruntled people when it comes to this topic.&nbsp; So.... can anyone rave about an oven that can be purchased now?&nbsp; If you have one that you love but you bought in 1965 I don&#039;t really want to know about it unless you&#039;d like to sell it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks for the help

				I got the same Cuisinart, it&#039;s much larger than a regular toaster oven and let&#039;s you use it as an oven if you are just making something for 1 or 2.&nbsp; You can get it at Bed Bath and Beyond using one of the 20% off coupons as well ;)

				I just last month got a new toaster oven from BedBathAndBeyond using a 20%-off coupon! It&#039;s a Black and Decker, and it seems to work quite well. It&#039;s got a little convection fan, which is noisy but seems to work fine. Makes good toast, although slowly. Looking through the options at the store, it definitely seemed like you get what you pay for. The $200 ones with digital thermostat looked quite nice, and they were additionally heavier, which presumably means better temperature regulation. Also, there were differences in the number of heating elements. Presumably more is better there too...

				I love using my toaster oven in the summer. It keeps the kitchen much cooler than turning on the regular oven. My sister is the queen of toaster oven baking. I think her most creative was baking slice-n-bake cookies in the toaster oven. There is enough room to bake about 6 cookies at a time and this way she won&#039;t eat the whole batch after making them in a traditional oven. When I have time, I use it to bake a potato.<br /><br />A tip about the BBB coupons, they usually still accept expired coupons for up to one month after the expiration date.

				I don&#039;t own a microwave, so I use my toaster oven pretty much all the time.&nbsp; I had one that I inherited from an old roommate that bit the dust last winter, so we had to shell out for a new one.&nbsp; We went by Bed Bath and Beyond and got this guy:<br />http://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/product.asp?order_num=-1&amp;SKU=13646015&amp;RN=685<br />and I&#039;ve been really happy with it.&nbsp; It&#039;s deep enough that I can make small pizzas on pita, there&#039;s a temperature control.&nbsp; All in all, a good buy for 30 bucks.

				I absolutely loved, loved this toaster oven so much that when my first one died after a few years, I bought the same one.&nbsp; It took a bit to get used to the basket, but once you get the hang of it and figure out what bakeware fits well, you&#039;re flying.&nbsp; I absolutely loved it for meats, fish &amp; chicken as well as anything that you wanted crispy, well-browned.&nbsp; <br />http://www.amazon.com/Toastmaster-TUV48-Ultravection-Oven/dp/B00005B6YQ (http://www.amazon.com/Toastmaster-TUV48-Ultravection-Oven/dp/B00005B6YQ)<br /><br />Now we needed a combo unit and this one works very well, but I still miss my basket!<br />http://www.electronicsoutfitter.com/store/171167/r-820bk.html (http://www.electronicsoutfitter.com/store/171167/r-820bk.html)

				I have a toaster oven but don&#039;t tend to use it much; with summer coming up I&#039;m keen on ideas for actual cooking using the toaster oven vs. heating up the gas one.&nbsp; Does anyone have any recommendations beyond thinks like potatoes and toast-based/grilled cheese-esque concoctions?<br /><br />I&#039;ll admit that part of my hesitancy to explore the toaster oven is based on the fact that it appears to use a LOT of power.&nbsp; Our lights dim when we turn the thing on, and it will blow a fuse if we use it in combination with certain appliances.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to jack up the electricity consumption too much just to keep cool.

				A lot of things you&#039;d use the oven for can be heated up in the toaster oven. You can do broiling and stuff in there too if you like the meat. At least I could in my old one back home. I&#039;ve made pork chops, chicken, and fish in it along with your standard potato and toast.

				I&#039;ll trade anyone a perfectly functional HP Deskjet 632C printer (with extra ink cartridges) for a toaster oven... then I, too, could love an appliance.<br /><br />Actually, if anyone wants this printer, it&#039;s free.

				How about DeLonghi?&nbsp; Are they still making toaster ovens?&nbsp; Not too long ago they were supposed to be the best.<br /><br />I use my toaster oven quite a bit, for small broiling jobs and very small baking jobs, reheating frozen latkes, making tuna melts and English muffin pizzas, and of course, for toasting.&nbsp; But I must always remember not to use it and the microwave simultaneously.<br /><br />

				That&#039;s another advantage of a toaster oven--you can bake without heating up the kitchen.&nbsp; Unfortunately, my toaster oven is hotter at the same setting than my conventional oven.<br /><br />One thing that may have made the toaster oven less popular is that commercially frozen entrees can&#039;t be prepared in a toaster oven.&nbsp; They tell you on the box not to use one.

				I have a Delonghi toaster oven, but I&#039;ve had it a really long time (I inherited it from my dad about 9 years ago), and I love it. I use it all the time... AND it&#039;s small enough to fit in my kitchen!

				Small enough to fit in the kitchen--that can be a major consideration in New York.&nbsp; It&#039;s why I don&#039;t have a slow cooker.<br /><br />But if there&#039;s one thing for which I love my toaster oven most (other than just plain toasting), it&#039;s small broiling jobs.&nbsp; If you have a single filet of fish to broil, it&#039;s so much easier to use the toaster oven than to use the broiler at the bottom of the stove!

				hmmmmm 4 years later I&#039;m once again (or is it STILL) in the market for a new toaster oven. <br /><br />We&#039;ve gotten along fine without one for the last 2 years - but now our little man is starting to appreciate toast and toasted sandwiches...and we&#039;re putting carbs back in our diet so...&nbsp; I want an oven b/c it&#039;s more versatile than a toaster - but seeing as how we&#039;ve gotten on this well for years w/out one I&#039;m not ready to give up 400 sqr inches of counter space. <br /><br />So again... can you recommend a small(ish) toaster oven?<br /><br />thanks for the help
