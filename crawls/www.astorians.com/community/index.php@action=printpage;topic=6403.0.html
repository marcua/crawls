				p.s. I just checked out your blog site (from your profile) and saw some of your pieces.....beautiful!!!!<br />I love your style and the imagery that you&#039;re working with. They&#039;re wonderfully executed!<br />I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s just me- but they seem to have an Asian influence to them aesthetically which I think is really unique and captivating!<br />Great combination of collage, painting, and textures!<br />can hardly wait to see some in person.....keep up the wonderful creating......

				Hey Sara!<br />Thank you so much for the kind words.&nbsp; Any Asian influence is not really intentional, however I have been to India twice and found it to be a beautiful and inspiring place so perhaps subconsciously.....<br /><br />Thank you for checking out my blog and if you haven&#039;t been to Site yet, they are having a artist reception for my work and another artist.&nbsp; It is on June 14th from 7-10, there will be cupcakes, wine, music, fun, etc.!<br /><br />I took a look at your site too, I defiantly see an Asian influence in your work, I love the horse piece on the bottom, reminds me of Susan Rothenberg.
