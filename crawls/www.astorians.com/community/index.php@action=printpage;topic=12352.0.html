				We do have a few Dunkin Donuts in the area, but this new one is down the street from me, so I&#039;m excited!&nbsp; And the one on Ditmars &amp; 31st is scary and most of the time the donuts are stale.&nbsp; I was actually hoping for a Krispy Kreme, but at least we didn&#039;t get a new bank, sushi place or pawn shop.

It has personality. All the other Dunkin Donuts in the city are all nice and brightly lit and renovated. Plus, I can go for months without setting foot in there and the lady still knows I want a small iced coffee with milk and one sugar. It makes me think I should go more often. I will say though that I preferred when the stuff there was way cheaper than it was at all other locations. When I moved here a little over 3 years ago, a small iced coffee was $1.29 including tax. Those were the days!

				I don&#039;t see the advantage in adding yet another Dunkin Donuts along Ditmars.&nbsp; If I&#039;m not mistaken, that will make SEVEN baked goods businesses in an 8 block area between Steinway and 31st Sts:<br /><br />Dunkin Donuts-Ditmars and 32nd<br />Ste. Honore Patisserie-Ditmars and 34th<br />Brooklyn Bagels-Ditmars and 35th<br />Astoria Bakery II-Ditmars and 36th<br />Martha&#039;s Country Bakery-Ditmars and 37th<br /><em>New</em> Dunkin Donuts-Ditmars and 38th<br />Bagel House-Ditmars and Steinway<br /><br />My waistline can&#039;t take much more.&nbsp; Curse you, delicious pastries, curse youuuu!&nbsp; :ticked:<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Well, technically donuts are fried goods, not baked goods, so that sets them apart. You can eat both and know you have some variety in your diet.&nbsp; :wink:

				I don&#039;t think this is happening any more.&nbsp; They&#039;ve taken down the &quot;Coming Soon-Dunkin Donuts&quot; sign.&nbsp; The space is just bare.&nbsp; Perhaps something better will come along.

				It&#039;s just as well.&nbsp; There&#039;s already two DD&#039;s within walking distance of there, actually three if you count the one that&#039;s part of the gas station on Astoria Blvd. in the 40&#039;s.

				they were doing some serious work on the interior of this space today. the whole floor surface had been removed and everything else stripped to bare walls. assuming it takes a lot of work to remove many years of fruit stand.<br /><br />i&#039;m pretty sure this space will still be a dunkin donuts, though.

				The closed veggie stand, Sunshine, is going to be a Dunkin Donuts. They had a &#039;coming soon&#039; sign up while they were tearing down the awning, bu then the sign got taken away.<br /><br />Three Dunkin Donuts (one near 31st, and one near 43rd) in such close proximity .... that&#039;s crazy.

				Hmm. I&#039;m originally from Boston, so love my Dunkin&#039;s, but I think Martha&#039;s definitely has them beat on quality of coffee on that block.

				The new DD opened today where Sunshine Fruits used to be.&nbsp; Sad but glad to see something open there 24/7.&nbsp; It&#039;s tiny!&nbsp; I can&#039;t tell if they make donuts there or bring them in.&nbsp; If they do, it&#039;s gotta be in the basement.&nbsp; I&#039;ll let you know if it&#039;s any good.
