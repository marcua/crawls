				We had a really nice experience at this new place last Friday night.&nbsp; The place was hopping.&nbsp; Great wine, beer, whiskey, and bourbon selection.&nbsp; The mussels were exceptional.&nbsp; We all tried different dogs and wursts but everyone in our group loved what they ordered.&nbsp; The servers were definitely a bit overwhelmed but they were doing the best they can and couldn&#039;t be more helpful and understanding.&nbsp; A second bartender just for Fri and Sat night might help.&nbsp; I highly recommend this place.&nbsp; It was a good time and a really tasty meal.&nbsp; http://www.newyorkdoghouse.com/ (http://www.newyorkdoghouse.com/)

				I have to agree.&nbsp; I have been there on 2 separate occasions and have enjoyed it both times.&nbsp; Definitely recommended.

				My wife and I checked Doghouse out last weekend, and had a blast. The food was great, the mac and cheese bested Sweet Afton in my estimation, the bangers and mash were so good that I made collards and mashed parsnips that sunday, and her asia dog was tasty. I would have liked one or two more draught beers or a few craft bottles, but aside from that minor quibble, which was offset by their fair to better bourbon list.

				I&#039;m a non-meat eating fan of NYC Doghouse and have chatted with the owner about a veggie dog option. He very much wants to have one on his menu but hasn&#039;t yet been able to find/make a veggie dog that he is happy with. He doesn&#039;t want to have something on the menu that he is sub-par.

				We went this afternoon and had 2 very good dogs, the Far East and the Relish.&nbsp; I liked the Far East dog (pork with garlic and ginger) better than the Relish one (a standard brat--tasty but not as novel as the num pang), but liked the Relish toppings better.<br /><br />Groupon has several deals going on now, for either 2 or 4 people.&nbsp; We just bought the one for 2 people: for $23, you get 2 of the special dogs, 1 order of fries, and 2 cocktails, beers, or glasses of wine, good Sunday-Thursday.&nbsp; Considering that the dogs alone range from $7-9, and the cocktails are $10 each, it&#039;s a heck of a bargain.

				Finally checked this place out. The &quot;hot dogs&quot; were great. So were the cocktails. And we loved the donut &amp; dipping cream desert. We&#039;ll definitely be back.
