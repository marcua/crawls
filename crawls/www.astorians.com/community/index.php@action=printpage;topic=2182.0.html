				(I suppose that if you are a Conservative then the reasoning might make sense.<br />Gives me more motivation to root for the others.&nbsp; &nbsp;8-)<br /><br />More doings until a coronation in Nov.<br /><br />I heartily agree that Republicans would be well served by a hotly contested primary. Democracy would do them and the state a lot of good. )<br /><br />http://www.nypost.com/postopinion/editorial/64075.htm<br /><br />FOR THE REPUBLICANS: FASO <br /><br />May 22, 2006 -- The seeming inevitability of Eliot Spitzer has conservatives of conscience in New York so disheart ened that many may be tempted to forego statewide elections this year - especially the race for governor. <br /><br />Which could be disastrous for healthy two-party politics in the state for many years to come. <br /><br />Taking a pass on going to the polls could result in a third-place finish (or fourth or fifth) for the GOP&#39;s gubernatorial nominee - embarrassing the party, costing it the second line on the ballot and weakening it even further, possibly for years. <br /><br />Even Democrats enthralled with the notion of regaining the Executive Chamber should fret about the prospect of prolonged one-party rule. Albany&#39;s dysfunction can only grow worse in such a circumstance. <br /><br />It is with all this in mind that The Post today endorses John Faso for the GOP nomination for governor in 2006. <br /><br />Faso has an admirable career of public service in New York, a principled voting record as a state assemblyman and healthy thoughts about how to steer the state back to fiscal sanity: He would be a good governor, the looming Spitzer tsunami notwithstanding. <br /><br />Meanwhile, would-be nominee William Weld offers an arguably commendable record as a former Massachusetts governor, but projects a current worldview that differs little from that of Democratic frontrunner Eliot Spitzer. <br /><br />Weld is an echo, not a choice. <br /><br />That&#39;s why Faso has a near-lock on the Conservative Party&#39;s gubernatorial endorsement. Thus, as the GOP nominee as well, he&#39;d spare Republicans a painful choice between GOP and Conservative candidates that could leave the Republican Party with a third-place finish. <br /><br />Impossible? Think back to 1990, when Pierre Rinfret headed the GOP ticket and Herb London ran as the Conservative: Republicans barely came in second. <br /><br />The consequences of a third-place finish would be far-reaching. It would mean a drop from line A down to oblivion - and organizational and ballot-access chaos for the party - for at least four years, perhaps longer. <br /><br />Let&#39;s be honest: Disenchantment among GOPers is deep. Republican leaders in the state (Gov. Pataki and state Senate Majority Leader Joe Bruno, in particular) have long since abandoned the party&#39;s principles - and still not made a dent in its slow-motion electoral slide. <br /><br />Frankly, a case can be made that Faso sounds a lot like George Pataki circa 1994 (while Weld resonates very much like the 2006 edition). <br /><br />Now, we understand that voter surveys, especially the respected Quinnipiac Poll, show Spitzer clobbering both Faso and Weld. <br /><br />But with Faso heading the ticket - articulate, hard-working and engaging - the party will be in a position to revive its principles. <br /><br />Certainly no candidate is as dedicated to holding back state spending and keeping down taxes as he is. That&#39;s a goal that ranks at the top for many New Yorkers. <br /><br />He also has a reputation as a social conservative: He opposes abortion and gay marriage. Though that won&#39;t appeal to many liberals in November, it will attract core conservatives. And anyway, his views are hardly as &quot;extremist&quot; as his critics try to pretend. <br /><br />By contrast, Weld, despite a respectable fiscal record in Massachusetts, has absolutely no experience in New York politics. And he quit his Bay State office early; combined with his sudden decision to run here, it&#39;s fair to question his commitment to any principles. <br /><br />Faso can do much good for the GOP. Delegates at next week&#39;s Republican convention would do well to make him their designee. There&#39;d still likely be a primary between him and Weld, but then GOP voters could make the final choice in September. <br /><br />Right now, Faso is their best hope. <br /><br />***<br />(A third or lower place finish for Republicans. What a wonderful dream that would be!)<br /><br /><br />http://www.publicenemy.com/index.php?page=page5&amp;item=4&amp;num=100<br /><br />A Letter To The New York Post<br /><br />o gee<br />Come and get your New York Post<br />New York Post right here<br />Come on y&#39;all<br />Get the bost stubost stubost<br />Coasta coasta New York Post<br />Yo New York Post don&#39;t brag or boast<br />...
