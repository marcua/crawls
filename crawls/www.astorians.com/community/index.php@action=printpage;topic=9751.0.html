				Hey guys,<br /><br />On Sunday, April 13th, I will be doing the 3-mile MS walk in Manhattan to raise money for a cure and I want to see if anyone would like to join my team: Team Razzamatazz! (Best team name ever.)&nbsp; MS is a total bummer and finding a cure would be a happy wonderful thing. If you can&#039;t do the walk with Team Razzamatazz, donating money to the cause would be awesome. <br /><br />MS royally sucks. If you know someone who has it, you know how awful and debilitating it can be. Join my team, burn some calories, donate to charity and help find a cure.<br /><br />Thanks for your support!<br /><br />Join the team:<br />http://msnyc.kintera.org/walkms/teamrazzamatazz

				Try this:<br /><br />http://msnyc.kintera.org/walkms/razzamatazz<br /><br />I think you can donate to my &quot;personal page&quot; - I&#039;m not sure how to donate to the whole team.&nbsp; Weird, right?&nbsp; I&#039;ve gotten a couple of donations from friends who aren&#039;t walking, though, so it does work.

				Thank you, gud stuf, for bumping this up.<br /><br />Multiple Sclerosis is a chronic, unpredictable disease of the central nervous system (the brain, optic nerves, and spinal cord). It is thought to be an autoimmune disorder. This means the immune system incorrectly attacks the person&#039;s healthy tissue.<br /><br />MS can cause blurred vision, loss of balance, poor coordination, slurred speech, tremors, numbness, extreme fatigue, problems with memory and concentration, paralysis, blindness and more. These problems may be permanent or may come and go.<br /><br />Most people are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50, although individuals as young as 2 and as old as 75 have developed it. MS is not considered a fatal disease as the vast majority of people with it live a normal life-span. But they struggle to live productively, usually facing increasing motor limitations.<br /><br />There is one week left for Astorians and all their families, friends and neighbors to participate in this HUGE fund raiser for MS. Help the thousands of New Yorkers with MS by making a donation now. Your donation will provide comprehensive support services, educational programs, and fund a national research initiative into the cause, treatments and cure for this chronic disease.<br /><br />The National Multiple Sclerosis Society funds more MS research than any other private organization. In addition to supporting studies which hope to reveal the cause and course of the disease, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society also provides much needed education, programs, and services to everyone who is affected by MS—including the diagnosed, their friends and families, and the health care professionals who work with them.<br /><br />No matter how small your donation, it is so needed. <br /><br />The cost of 1 fancy coffee.<br /><br />The cost of 1 meal eaten out during the week.<br /><br />The cost of 1 drink.<br /><br />Please, dig into your checkbook, wallet, coin jar, under the pillows on your sofa—wherever you can—help eradicate this crippling disease of middle aged people cut down in the prime of their lives

				The walk this morning was great!&nbsp; Team Razzamatazz raised a total of $1,201.&nbsp; My team goal was $567 and we blew that out of the water.&nbsp; It was a little cold this morning but the sun came out as we crossed the finish line.&nbsp; And at least it didn&#039;t rain.&nbsp; <br /><br />Again, thank you so much to those of you who gave money and supported the cause.&nbsp; It was truly touching to me that we Astorians, as a community, support each other.&nbsp; I feel incredibly lucky to be a part of such an amazing group of people.&nbsp; Thank you, thank you, thank you.&nbsp; <br /><br />Hopefully this will be the last MS walk because the cure will be found in 2008.&nbsp; &nbsp;
