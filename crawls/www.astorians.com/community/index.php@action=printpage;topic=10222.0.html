				Heeeeeelp! I want a bike!! But I know nothing about them! Everyone in astoria has a bike right? So what do I need to know when buying one? I just want one to ride sometimes ... like when I feel like it, for example. Something simple ... I won&#039;t be doing any marathons or anything involving the woods. I&#039;m 5&#039;2, and a chick. Any advice?

				Depends what you want to do, there are three basic styles for adults (Barring specialty bikes, like BMX or Trials): <br />Road, Mtn and Hybrid.<br />Road bikes have a more hunched over position and are more suited for efficiency and long distance riding.<br />Mountain bikes are generally for trails, although a lot of people use them in thc city because they are generally more sturdy and easier to handle. <br />Hybrid bikes are a more upright position, built for comfort and more suited for street and recreational riding.<br /><br />Head down to your local shop, I&#039;m sure they&#039;ll help talk you through the details and find the bike that&#039;s right for you.

The ones you had when you were a kid had a coasting function. Meaning if the bike was going forward, your pedals could stay still. On a fixed gear bike, your pedaling is locked into the motion of the wheel- very dangerous for an inexperienced rider. If the bike is moving forward on a fixed gear, so are your pedals. To slow down, you don&#039;t simply pedal backwards, you have to slow the pedals down gradually or lock the pedals up to cause a skid. Good call on the no fixed gear thing, though- it&#039;s terrible for inexperienced riders.

				yea, I can&#039;t do the whole $300 on a bike thing. I honestly am not like looking into riding marathons, just <em>maybe</em> to and from work, and around the park or something in nice weather. Purely recreational, I don&#039;t need anything fancy, I just want something that won&#039;t kill me, and something I won&#039;t hate after a week. And I don&#039;t really need to buy a bike from people who know stuff, cuz I know ppl who can take care of it, like putting it together and any maintenance it might need in time. I reeeally don&#039;t want to spend more than $100, especially since I don&#039;t even have any space for a bike. I&#039;m planning on leaving it in the middle of a room like a statue.&nbsp; :-D

				I got my current bike from Great Used Bikes.com (http://www.greatusedbikes.com/) and I&#039;m pretty happy with it.&nbsp; It&#039;s an old 10 speed Ross, but it has the upright, curved handlebars so it&#039;s comfortable to ride.&nbsp; Most of those bikes frun from $150 to $200.<br /><br />But Spokesman Cycles (http://www.spokesmancycles.com/) in LIC is a really great bike store that is very involved in the community.&nbsp; Carlos and Illeana who run it are super friendly.&nbsp; They should be able to answer a lot of your questions even if you don&#039;t end up buying a bike from them.&nbsp; (I think they might be who KidMurdock meant when he recommended Sportsman Cycles).

				If you have a 4th floor Apt, like I do- I would shy away from a $99 Target job. the bike will weigh about 45+ pounds and that in itself is a workout hucking it up and down the stairs. If you have access to a basement or storage space, it will make it simpler- and easy on the back. But a 45 lb bike is a 45 lb bike and will be a beast climbing any hills- like 20th ave between 31st and the park in each direction. If you are fairly serious about getting around by bike, spend the extra money on a lightweight bike- used or otherwise. you WILL appreciate the lack of bulk.<br /><br />It was a big difference when I went from my generic 10 speed 45lb steel frame tanker to the RT300 Aluminum 24 pounder.<br />Purchased at Astoria bikes/Tony&#039;s about 12 years ago, BTW.

				i live on the fifth floor, but i have an elevator&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />actually i went into target today to buy a mirror and i checked out their bikes. I figured out my size is 24&quot;. It made me feel tiny. They only had two in that size and they weren&#039;t cool. <br /><br />PS - I&#039;m really not <em>serious</em> about &#039;getting around&#039; by bike. I literally just want it to take me to work sometimes (right now i walk - it&#039;s 40 minutes if i walk reeeeeeally really slow) and for weekends when i have nothing to do while all my friends are busy i can go ride my bike down to the park, which is far from where i live. <br /><br />This is part of why I&#039;m reluctant to buy a $300 bike. I looked on craigslist last nite, I cannot believe how expensive the used ones are! What do you guys do about storage? I&#039;m thinking of two very strategically placed shelf brackets sticking out of a wall, so the bike will rest on them vertically. anyone else?

				For your purposes, sounds like the $80 big box special will be fine. Just don&#039;t lock it outside w/anything besides a U-Lock or Kryptonite quad chain. Cable locks are about as reliable as silly string.<br /><br />I have three mtbs and a fixed gear track bike (no brakes). No worries about &quot;accidentally&quot; purchasing a fixie&nbsp; :-D (and no, I&#039;m not a hippie poseur, I adore the fixie for all the right reasons: stealthy quiet, pure beauty, super responsive, lively, lightweight, low maintenance, theft deterrent, cheap.)<br /><br />If you find that bicycling becomes a passion, you&#039;ll eventually crave something lighter, sturdier, nimble and versatile. I started out with a rigid steel mtb; a decade later, splurged on a hardtail (front suspension); not long after that, went nuts and got the full-suspension so I could ride crazier trails while keeping up with the guys. But I&#039;m obsessed with mountain biking :lol: and each of my bikes has a purpose:<br /><br /><strong>Rigid:</strong> Now a street/commuter bike w/slick tires, back rack, and theft-resistance. Can be locked up.<br /><strong>Hardtail:</strong> Burly, low-maintenance trail bike that feels amazing riding in the city. Can take on potholes, curbs, steel plates, etc. Also a great bike to travel with and training on the road.<br /><strong>Full-suspension:</strong> For long-distance mtb races (35-50 miles), riding upstate where the trails are much harder, keeping up with the faster guys/gals!<br /><strong>Track fixed:</strong> Got it for the velodrome, then got bored w/the track and started riding it around the park....then around town....then to work.....then to Belmont......then to Ft. Totten........makes the most mundane rides terrifying&nbsp; :-o<br /><br />

				What makes the Quad Chain so damn amazing is that the corners are rounded while the sides are straight (hence being a &quot;quadrilateral&quot; or however you spell it.) Structually immune to bolt cutters, would need a blow torch to cut through the links. Don&#039;t think hardware-store chains are quite that sturdy.

				hardware chains can be cut with a saw or with bolt cutters.&nbsp; Even the lower end kryptonite chains are easily clipped with bolt cutters.&nbsp; I learned this the hard way.&nbsp; <br />Also, if you have quick release tires, make sure that they&#039;re secured, because it sucks carrying a one wheeled bike home (also true for seats).

				My sister recently gave me her unused bike two weeks ago and now I am hooked!! I haven&#039;t needed a lock yet because I have just been riding around and getting used to the Astoria roads and not stopping anywhere. I have a new appreciation for all of those others on bikes in this crazy-driver city. I rode to Roosevelt Island last week. What an awesome island and a great place to ride!<br />&nbsp;<br />Do the bike shops you mentioned in Astoria also have helmets? That is one thing I am currently lacking and really want to get. I will get a lock soon too. I would also like an odometer. Do you think it is worth it? I have just been using Google maps to figure out exactly how far I have been riding. <br /><br />Finally, Time Out New York just posted an article about four great rides in NYC including one in Queens at the end of the F line. <br />Here is the link: http://www.timeout.com/newyork/articles/features/29132/great-rides<br /><br />(is this off-topic or is there another thread about riding in Queens?)<br />

				For those interested, Transportation Alternatives &nbsp;(http://www.transalt.org/)a pro-cycling, pedestrian and open space advocacy group has had a Queens Committee (http://groups.google.com/group/TAWQ) for a year and a half now.&nbsp; We&#039;ve out together a Tour de Queens (http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=10029.0) for this June and several smaller rides, many of which are coming up in Bike Month (http://bikemonthnyc.org/), and sponsored Teach Your Child to Ride events.&nbsp; We also lobby for safer conditions for cyclists, in fact we are in the middle of a fight to have painted buffered bike lanes run along Vernon (http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/vernonblvd.pdf), a proposal that DoT has put forward but was tabled at last night&#039;s CB2 meeting, despite getting an earlier unanimous vote in favor by their Land Use Committee.&nbsp; <br /><br />You can check out our google group (http://groups.google.com/group/TAWQ) and read the message board and info we have on our pages to learn more about us.&nbsp; We meet the second Monday of each month at the Greater Astoria Historical Society on 35-20 Broadway 4th floor from 6:30p-8p and all are invited.<br /><br />As for a bike helmet, I would think that all bike shops sell them, but the DoT gives out free helmets that are actually pretty spiffy, you can find the next event they will handing them out at by checking the DoT April Biking Newsletter (http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/email/newsletter_bicycles_apr08.html#helmets) or by 311.

				Im bringing this back from the dead - because I don&#039;t want to start a new topic. I got a bike off craigslist, good price, nice lady, decent bike, whatever it works. On a side note, I accidentally destroyed the combination to the lock I put on the chain so now it is useless&nbsp; :oops:<br />But as it turns out I&#039;m in such bad horrible shameful shape, I can&#039;t ride the damn thing for more than 20 minutes at a time without almost falling over dead and devouring (multiple) bottles of water. I&#039;ve heard about bike trainers, and I wonder if anyone has experience with them. I know I should look up my own stuff online, but I don&#039;t want to get scammed. :(<br />Help me cuz you love me! :angel:

				You can probably just clip the lock, salvage the chain, and then buy a keyed lock, so that you don&#039;t have to go through the trouble of the combination.<br />As for bike trainers, there are a lot of different versions out there.&nbsp; The most common is the magnetic type offered by CyclOps:<br />http://www.rei.com/product/707996?cm_mmc=cse_froogle-_-datafeed-_-product-_-na&amp;mr:trackingCode=CCD8B126-AB22-DD11-98CA-001422107090&amp;mr:referralID=NA<br />you can get a less expensive version off the E-bays from a company called Minoura.&nbsp; I have the low end Minoura:<br />http://www.bikesomewhere.com/bikesomewhere.cfm/product/349/2866/10457<br />I don&#039;t know about all of these trainers, but at least with the Minoura one that I have, I had to replace the back axel with one that hooks into the trainer.&nbsp; <br />Honestly, the only time that I use the trainer is in the winter to try and keep in shape for spring / summer riding.&nbsp; I think cycling is so much fun because of the stuff you can see outside.&nbsp; For me it&#039;s the same way with jogging / running.&nbsp; I can&#039;t jog or run on a treadmill, because it&#039;s so boring, but I don&#039;t mind jogging outside.<br />If you really want to get used to your bike, my recommendation would be to ride outside, take your rides at your own pace, and give yourself a day to recover in between rides.&nbsp; It will allow your body to acclimate to doing real rides better than the trainer, as you&#039;ll have slight terrain changes. One of my personal favorite rides is going down Vernon into LIC and then back into Astoria.&nbsp; The traffic is usually fairly light, it&#039;s not confusing, and there aren&#039;t a whole lot of major hills or anything.

				If all you can do is short distances just start with that.&nbsp; Bike to the grocery store or a nearby friend&#039;s.&nbsp; Take a trip to the closest park for a picnic lunch on a nice day.&nbsp; Bike to the farthest subway station you can and lock you bike up there, then take the subway the rest of the way to work.&nbsp; I work in SoHo and there is no way I&#039;m riding 10 miles each way to work on any kind of regular basis.&nbsp; So I ride to Queens Plaza, lock up there and take the train the rest of the way.&nbsp; When I come home, I hope off there and ride back.&nbsp; It&#039;s about 20 minutes of riding, not too much, but enough that I feel good for being a little active.&nbsp; If you start out killing yourself you won&#039;t have fun and you won&#039;t do it again and you won&#039;t get better.&nbsp; It&#039;s all about baby steps.<br /><br />You can also ride the stationary bike at the gym, which is easier than riding on the actual road I find but good for getting your wind up.

In addition, it will make your riding easier. It is night and day riding on knobby tires and road tires.

				I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ll be riding in the Century Ride this year (http://www.nyccentury.org/), I usually just volunteer at the Astoria rest stop.&nbsp; But it is a fun way to check on the city on a bike.<br /><br />I know they sell Krispy Kremes at random locations around the city, but that stupid search doesn&#039;t show their vendors, only the KK stores.&nbsp; But doughnuts, delightful though they may be, are waaaaaay off topic here.&nbsp; And I apologize.&nbsp; I just love them so much,
