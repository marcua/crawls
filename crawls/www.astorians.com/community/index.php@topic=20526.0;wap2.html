			I was reading an article about who is running for Mayor in 2013, and it made me think about what happens when Peter Vallone is term-limited out in 2013.&nbsp; Any ideas of who&#039;s out there to run for his seat?&nbsp; 20 months will go faster than we all think!

			Let&#039;s see if the Mayan&#039;s were right first, and then worry about 2013.

			I think local activist/District Leader Costa Constantinides would be the front runner for the council seat. I see him everywhere. He&#039;s been in the local paper many times, including the rally to have a speed bump put on 21st Ave. He&#039;s also involved heavily in many civics in Astoria, such as being Vice President of the Long Island City-Astoria Alliance. He served as chair of the Coalition for a Better Astoria, which helped stop Fed Ex from moving their trucking facility into Astoria. He is also the President of the Queens County Young Democrats. Costa has fought to advocate for issues such as marriage equality and responsible development. Someone who is this involved must be the front runner for the Council seat!

			Lots more to do, and the Mayas.<br /><br />Obama will win NY again and very likely will win re-election.<br />What grade would you give him thus far?<br /><br /><br />http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/subjects/politifacts-top-promises/<br /><br /><br />Also I would be curious what kind of Council speaker Costa would like to see. Another Quinn?
