			With all the places to eat around here, you think there would be more of a variety of diferent types of food, but there isn't. We need more restaurants that offer more variety of ethnic dishes around here.

			Ok, &nbsp;a few places outside of Astoria (dont tell anyone).<br /><br />one is in willamsburg nest to union pool bar under the bqe by lorimar street??? &nbsp; very good. &nbsp;great seviche with that tiger juice sauce that rocks your world. &nbsp;the best chicken and chimichuri.<br /><br />the other is in jackson heights. &nbsp;just off roosevelt and 81st street? its an illegal restaurant owned and run by a woman and her daughters out of their home. &nbsp; this one is iffy as to exact location &nbsp;as ive only been there with people from that neighborhood that showed me the way. &nbsp; what a revelation though.<br /><br />1st ave by 6th street (village) and the sister on on smith by pacific (carrol gardens)? &nbsp; both very good.<br /><br />Id kill for one around here.
