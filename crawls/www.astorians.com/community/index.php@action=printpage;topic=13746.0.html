				I have one son there, currently in 4th grade.&nbsp; He&#039;s been pretty happy there.&nbsp; He was in the Talented and Gifted program at PS 150 in Sunnyside for a year and hated it.&nbsp; This is obviously not as challenging for him, but the teachers are so far all good and the school has a pretty good atmosphere.&nbsp; It&#039;s much more welcoming than PS 150 or PS 85 (where I have one in preK) in my experience, they don&#039;t treat parents as dangerous interlopers in the school as those others do.&nbsp; I also figure that even though he&#039;s not getting all the accelerated curricula he would have in the gifted program he has time to pursue his own interests and learn the stuff he really wants to.&nbsp; They have a good art program and music as well.<br /><br />That said, the 4th grade is brutal for State tests and they hammered the prep pretty hard. He&#039;s got the ELA behind him and just starting on the math prep now, 6 weeks before the test.&nbsp; I understand that a lot rides on the scores for the school but I think they&#039;re prepping the kids too much.&nbsp; It stressed them out and it&#039;s boring (at least for my son who does pretty well on tests.)&nbsp; <br /><br />All in all given the options in the area I think it&#039;s as good a school as you&#039;re going to find.&nbsp; I was not impressed with the Charter School, but I know a lot of people are, though it&#039;s hard to get into.&nbsp; If it&#039;s your zoned school I&#039;d recommend it.&nbsp; There&#039;s a lot to be said for having it close to home.&nbsp;

				Thank you Gretchen.<br /><br />Funny you mentioned the Charter school, I am attending their open house next week just to have an idea. I am also considering ps 122 even though I am not zoned for it and hope for the best. <br /><br />These schools are driving me crazy and it&#039;s only kindergarten!!!!<br />

				I know what you mean.&nbsp; &nbsp;I actually thought I was past it for a bit, having settled on 234, but then a comment about middle school got me going earlier this year...visiting&nbsp; is the way to go if you can (I&#039;m not sure 122 will go for that) to get a feel for the place.&nbsp; You know your kid best.&nbsp; It is a big decision so it&#039;s worthy of some craziness I suppose.&nbsp; It does make me long for the simplicity of suburban schools, if you&#039;re in a good place.&nbsp; But then you have to live in the burbs...
