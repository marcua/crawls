				As suggested, here is an Academic Astorians thread. I know we have a few academics and I&#39;m hoping a few lurkers will come out. <br /><br />In school? Almost back in school (in my case!) Involved in academia, somehow, be it be teaching or researching some obscure topic? <br /><br />I will be going to U Chicago in September (but plan to keep up with Astorians as a way of procrastinating when I don&#39;t want to write papers) for a one year, accelerated MA program. I am a bit intimidated by very excited because I am a dork and love school. I&#39;ll be studying political science, with a concentration in theory. <br /><br />So here is a thread to share our life as over-educated academics.&nbsp; :-D

				Thanks for setting up this thread, Rachel!&nbsp; I am relatively new to Astoria, having moved here from Boston at the end of January.&nbsp; I&#39;m working on my dissertation for the art history department at Harvard and juggling a number of freelance jobs in the meantime.&nbsp; I&#39;m researching esoteric Buddhist art in silk road Buddhist cave sites in northwest China (stuff like mandalas, paintings of multi-armed/headed deities, etc.).&nbsp; I am very excited about the prospect of making new and thrilling discoveries, although it seems a long way off.&nbsp; &nbsp;:| <br /><br />I am possibly even a bigger dork than anyone realizes, because I am actually going to have to stay home Friday night to get some work done, but I&#39;ll be at the EATs dinner next week and hope to see you, Rachel and meet other Astorians, academic or otherwise!

				Cool, thanks Rachel for starting this thread! I&#39;m Harlan, I&#39;m a post-doc in the Psych department at NYU, studying categorization and concept learning. That&#39;s the area that looks at how you learn to look at, say, a cat, and despite the fact that it&#39;s different from all the other cats you&#39;ve ever seen in all sorts of ways, identify it as a cat and treat it as though it was a cat. Oh, and also, I model. <br /><br />You, stop laughing! I&#39;ve been in town for 3 years, the first at Columbia and the second commuting to UConn, and have had this job for a year. I just yesterday submitted (for the 3rd time) an application for an NIH fellowship that will give me a 3rd and 4th years at NYU. And I&#39;ll also be on the job market this fall, although my vita will need a boost if I&#39;m going to get much of anything!<br /><br /><br />

				Oh lord, school.<br /><br />Well, it&#39;s a long, boring story that I&#39;m sure no one cares about (involving majoring in account at UConn, dropping out, community college, randomly and ironically getting a full time job in accounting that I kept for 6.5 years, way too much time spent on Metro North, moving here, and a few select awesome teachers and bosses), but I&#39;m going into my Senior year at SVA as a Photography major. I&#39;m interning part time this summer, living off my savings (yes, I know that gravy train will end soon) and even though there were points in my life where I was all &quot;omg, what the heck am I really DOING?&quot; it has all seemed to work out, and the best I can do is trust that it still will.<br /><br />I will say this though, dropping out was the best decision I ever made, and I&#39;m POSITIVE I&#39;m appreciating my college experience now more than I ever would have 9 years ago (my GAWD, it&#39;s been nine years since I was all, &quot;yeah, this college thing just ain&#39;t workin&#39; for me right now&quot;. Crazy.)

				Hey Alison, it&#39;s never too late to achieve your dreams!<br />I just graduated from Columbia with my Master of Science in Social Work this past May <br />I made it to NYC after taking a leave of absence from business school (after five years of dragging my feet there part time while buring endless hours in the exciting world of HR recruitment, i figured it was time for a change)<br />I hope to be doing the PhD track in Gerontology by 2008...<br />

				Well, before moving here in July from Boston, I was on the faculties of Northeastern University, Gordon College, and the New England Conservatory (with whom I&#39;m still involved)-yes, all at the same time. I also guest lectured at numerous schools, including Harvard and the California Institute for the Arts. I&#39;m not an academic in the literal sense-I taught mostly performance studies and composition (with a little Jazz History thrown in).<br />I should be doing some lesson teaching privately here in the Fall (privately and at one or two colleges). <br />Personally, very little of what I do professionally I actually learned in school-to be honest, I tend to discourage students from pursuing higher education (especially advanced degrees) if they want to perform. I always believed that experience was far more important then reading about what others did-needless to say, this didn&#39;t make me particularly popular with college administrations.<br />Which is why I left more college affiliations then most people have in a lifetime (I&#39;ve quit 9 faculty positions-granted all part time, but for the same reasons-not enough emphasis on experience and helping individual students gain insight to the reality of a performing career).<br />Well, there&#39;s my rant :-)

				My dream is to never leave academia.&nbsp; :-D<br /><br />I eventually want to get my PhD in political science and teach college. I am merrily setting myself up for years of being poor, but at least I will always have lots of books. My study of political theory means I have little patience for the black &amp; white terms of &quot;liberal&quot; and &quot;conservative&quot; but I manage to bite my tongue and not be annoying about it.<br /><br />I did my BA thesis on &quot;The Conservative Theory of Governance and the Rise of the American Right&quot; I cannot wait to get back to school.

				I too, gave academia the best years of my life but have snubbed it (at least for now).<br /><br />&nbsp;I moved to new york upon my acceptance to NYU&#39;s Sackler Institute of Biomedical Science (at the School of Medicine, unfortunately in Kips Bay and NOT downtown). Well on my way to getting a Ph.D in microbial pathogenesis and molecular genetics (in the microbiology department), I decided that life was worth more than the ludicrous $24,000/yr stipend and being stuck in lab all weekend. Oh and also all the faculty in the microbio department at NYU suck hard. But whatever. I took my leave of absence from the doctoral program in December of 2003 and haven&#39;t looked back since... <br /><br />My interests still lie in the molecular basis of infectious disease (parasitology and virology being my areas of expertise) but now I&#39;m thinking about an eventual MPH in epidemiology or else that trusty ol&#39; MA program in science journalism at NYU. I&#39;m a glutton for punishment too.

				Harlan, there&#39;s a professor in my field who does work similar to what you&#39;ve described - he works on tourism to animal-shaped rock formations and has totally gotten into the cognitive science aspect - why does one rock rather than another appear to resemble a dragon/camel/fill in the blank.&nbsp; He&#39;s even attended cognitive science conferences!<br /><br />Annie, what do you do now?<br /><br />Grad school can be tough, and in my opinion, should not be undertaken unless the M.A./Ph.D. is what you really need in order to pursue the teaching/research/other career that you want.&nbsp; I enjoy watching &quot;The Sopranos&quot; and mentally assigning different characters to the members of my dissertation committee.&nbsp; It helps me get used to the hierarchy of grad school.&nbsp; I, of course, am Christopher though less bumbling I hope.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-P

				Oh, I just mean that after over a decade of practicing, I&#39;m sick of the whole thing.&nbsp; I just reentered the big firm corporate law world after six years of being on my own (which was preceded by over 4 years in the big firm corporate law world, preceded by a couple of years at the NYC Commission on Human Rights).&nbsp; There&#39;s nothing wrong with it really, and I was being a little tongue-in-cheek, but what I&#39;d really love to do is photography.&nbsp; Funny, this spring I was just starting to get some paying photography gigs, but a very good job offer just about fell into my lap, and I really couldn&#39;t pass it up.&nbsp; (I went to Brooklyn Law, btw.)<br /><br />As for linguistics, well, I went to Bates College, which is a small liberal arts college in Maine.&nbsp; They didn&#39;t have a linguistics major, but they did have a few classes.&nbsp; One of them, an intro to linguistics, was taught as a freshman seminar course.&nbsp; The professor worked quite extensively with me on creating an interdisciplinary linguistics major, but it involved a little too much computer science and Chinese, and the structure of course prerequisites was such that I would not have been able to go away for my junior year (which I did, to Switzerland, and actually took a really intensive French linguistics course while there, at the University of Fribourg).&nbsp; So I just remained a French major.&nbsp; I think all but 5 of the courses I took in all four years were language-related (French, German, Spanish, Russian and linguistics).

				I thought I would revive this thread, since I re-enter Academia um…way too soon. I am starting to get nervous; I’m not sure I remember how to write a paper.<br /><br />So, anyone up for coffee/tea maybe Sunday afternoon for those of us who aren&#39;t escaping for the long weekend. I could use the wisdom of those of you have already been through grad school and survived, especially Michelle&nbsp; (mcw) because of the U Chicago connection!) <br /><br />Plus, where I grew up Labor Day was the quintessential last weekend of summer before school started, so I feel the need to be as social as possible before school starts. (I know most others parts of the country start in August, Jersey is weird.) Some one in academia assure me that I will eventually STOP feeling like September is the start of a new year….<br />

				Rachel, I don&#39;t believe at all that you&#39;ve forgotten how to write a paper!&nbsp; But I&#39;d love to come out on Sunday and be social - maybe early afternoon, if that works for most folks?<br /><br />And don&#39;t be nervous, really - grad school unfolds in cumulative steps.&nbsp; You will get used to it in no time and work your way up gradually to the diss.
