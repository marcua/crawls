				I went on a hunt for a wedding dress all over Midtown yesterday, but had no results except for a headache and a solid night's sleep owed to my exhaustion. My upcoming wedding is going to be very simple, and non-traditional, so what I am wanting is very different than what I am seeing in the wedding stores and bridal magazines - less showy and less fairy-tale-like.<br /><br />Anyway, I am just wondering how much someone would charge to make a dress for me, and of course I'd need proof that you are good at what you do. I'd provide the pattern, fabric, etc. and pay you to do the rest.<br /><br />And of course, if you know of anyone or any places that would do this for a reasonable cost please let me know.<br /><br />In the meantime I am just going to keep looking (but on the internet - can't run around all over the place just for a dress that I will likely wear only once).<br /><br />Thanks!

				If your drycleaner does tailoring, ask there. &nbsp;They may not be willing to take on sewing a dress, but they might know who would.<br /><br />Also, I'd try posting to craigs list. &nbsp;good luck...

				Thanks... Good ideas.<br /><br />I did post on craigslist, and got a response, albeit from someone that didn't exactly sound like my style. I may have found something on the internet that will work but I am still not completely sure. We'll see!

				I know exactly what you are going through. I was married last year and did not see anything I liked that was exactly what I wanted. I grew up on I love Lucy and liked the style she wore back then. I got 2 friends who know fabric s and how to sew. Rather than make a dress from scratch I bought something that they could work with. I got it cheap and then enhanced it with my idea their know how and then went to someone in Queens who made the changes to the dress.<br /><br />If interested in the seamstress let me know I can get her info for you.

				Hi Nancy! Thanks for your kind words!<br /><br />I posted an ad on craigslist a few weeks ago and found a great seamstress to do the dress for me. She is wanting to start up her own line of clothing eventually and wants to practice and build her portfolio. Currently she designs baby clothes for a well known company. Anyway, she is fantastic. Right now she is working on making the pattern for my dress as it is a from scratch, no purchased pattern dress. I am very impressed thus far!<br /><br />Thanks again, and I'll let you all know how the dress turns out. I am sure it will be great!

				I googled 'NY dress designers' and found a number of inexpensive places downtown. &nbsp; Have you tried &quot;RK Bridal.com&quot; or &quot;Bridalmart.com&quot;? &nbsp;I am getting married in June and wanted to have my gown professionally made also but, because of the time frame I had to go w/a designer gown.<br />Have you picked your wedding invitations?

				I did check out RK Bridal, but not Bridalmart. Honestly, I was very disappointed when I dropped by RK Bridal (actually went there). The main reason being is that our wedding is not going to be traditional at all, and it is difficult to find places that cater to the non-traditional, simple bride (basically don't even think wedding - think informal, relaxing picnic in the park). Plus, our budget is so incredibly low that I can't even conceive of spending more than a couple hundred dollars on the dress (and that's how much I'm getting it made for). Finding &quot;the dress&quot; has been the bane of my existence, and am now breathing a sigh of relief with this girl who is making it for me.<br /><br />I am designing our wedding invitations (used to do web and graphic design freelance, so am comfortable doing it), and we'll probably have them printed next month or April.
