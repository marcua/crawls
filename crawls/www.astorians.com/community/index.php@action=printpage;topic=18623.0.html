				I have been apartment hunting for the past few months, and don&#039;t want to pay a broker&#039;s fee just on principle. I have seen a few good places that I liked, but I really do not want to pay a month&#039;s extra rent nor do I want to pay 15% of my annual rent to someone for essentially doing nothing except put me in contact with the person I am actually paying rent to. <br /><br />I may get flamed for this, but from what I am seeing, these guys do nothing but swoop in and claim apartments as their own exclusive listing, and then rent them to you at a ridiculous markup, calling it a &quot;broker&#039;s fee&quot;. In this day and age, it is not difficult to go online, find a listing and go see it yourself- I simply do not understand how a broker justifies charging an exorbitant fee for doing something I could just as easily do myself.

				well because there are plenty of lazy people that don&#039;t want/can&#039;t put in the effort to look for a place themselves. Also some apartments are exclusive to certain real estates if they struck a deal w/ the landlord

				Good question! We didn&#039;t use one for our search, but were kinda stuck with having to go through one with the house purchase. What&#039;s worse, is that the more you know about purchasing (what to look for, what prices should be, how much work needs to be done at what cost, etc. etc.), the less appealing a client you become. <br /><br />Realtors would rather have lazy, clueless people who will fall in love with a house and try to bid the most because it&#039;s <em>sooooo</em> wonderful.&nbsp; :roll: I was suspicious of everything he said, not b/c of anything personal, but b/c it&#039;s the nature of the business. <br /><br />Luckily it worked out, but there was at least one time we were kicked out of an open house when the woman realized we&#039;d already been in contact with another broker. Jeeeez louise.<br /><br />They&#039;re salespeople, basically.

				Well since alot of people do come into this area from out of town and dont know anyone here , they depend on a broker to set them up in a nice apt and in a nice area . Might sound expensive but&nbsp; not much choice when every block seems the same at first .&nbsp; At the same time&nbsp; running credit ,background checks and making up leases are what most brokers end up doing so&nbsp; it helps out the owner of the house or building in finding a &quot;good&quot; person .

				<em>running credit ,background checks and making up leases </em> <br /><br />Ah, well for renting I suppose it&#039;s a different story, where landlords don&#039;t want to be bothered. Same with house hunting- owners don&#039;t want to be bothered worrying about what to do. <br /><br />When purchasing, though, we figured since we had to employ a real estate lawyer <em>anyway</em>, he could handle most contractual stuff. We had to provide our own financial info to the mortgage company, including credit reports and scores (easy enough to provide.) Background checks aren&#039;t really an issue when it comes to purchasing!

				Theres plenty of landlords that wont even look at a potential renter unless refered straight from a broker and that broker has done their application and background checks .&nbsp; My neighbor has his apt vacant and wont even look at anyone unless they are recomended from an office . Ofcourse that office cant guarantee anything , as far as that person paying on time or even being a good tenant , but i guess the thinking is&nbsp; if someone goes thru a realtor they will be more serious&nbsp; and worthy as a tenant .

				I actually thought it was the opposite- it was my thinking that there was more involved in purchaseing property (legal paperwork, surveying etc.) than in renting it. <br /><br />In my experience, any decent apartments I&#039;ve seen have one month or 10-15% annual rent tacked on as a &quot;broker&#039;s fee&quot;. I can see how a landlord would want a tenant to provide a credit report and references, but this stuff is easily furnishable by the potential tenant. Additionally, I have never encountered a broker who ran anything other than a credit check. <br />They basically do nothing that anyone else couldn&#039;t easily do him- or herself. <br />What also irks me is that there is not even an option to deal directly with a landlord or management company in many of these situations. I can understand that some people can use a broker if they are unfamiliar with the territory, but it&#039;s not necessary if you know where you want to live and what you want to pay. <br /><br />This is NY- most apartments can basically rent/sell themselves. It&#039;s a cutthroat market out there, and these scavengers just drive up prices and then sandbag you into paying fees for basically snaking in and claiming a property as &quot;exclusive&quot; to that broker.

				To all:<br /><br />In answer to the original post:<br />Can someone please explain to me why broker&#039;s exist?<br /><br />I can sincerely respond that as a Realtor I am appreciated and respected by most of those that I have worked with.&nbsp; And I am happy to exist as a Realtor as it has allowed me the time to care for my little one while paying the college tuition for the older one.&nbsp; I am an honest, responsible and a hard working Realtor.&nbsp; I&#039;m not perfect, but for the time that I spend on each and every transaction, I am worth every penny of it.&nbsp; <br /><br />I take my work seriously, as finding or selling a property is a difficult task.&nbsp; Especially in this market and with everyone running around with a busy schedule.&nbsp; The process of securing a new home makes everyone quite anxious, and there are moments when everyone is frazzled, but with patience and understanding we/I make it through.&nbsp; It is often a bumpy ride, especially when purchasing a co-op, as board approval is required.<br /><br />For the Buyer:&nbsp; I consider myself a personal shopper, in that many will tell me what they qualify for, and what they want and I keep an eye out for that particular property or those particular properties, which may work for them and their family<br /><br />For the Seller:&nbsp; I consider myself their hired gun in that they can leave the responsibility to me, and I will take care of the marketing, open houses, and scheduling of all showings.&nbsp; And of course there is much more that is involved.&nbsp; A million calls and a million emails at least.&nbsp; LOL<br /><br />This is the side that many do not know about:<br /><br />In a co-op transaction I can easily spend 50-75 hours.&nbsp; During this time I do not get paid.&nbsp; From the time a buyer makes an offer until the time a buyer closes on a property, three to six months may go by.&nbsp; And again I do not get paid. <br /><br />These transactions entail housecleaning, photos, phones calls, emails, many showings, negotiations, open houses, board application review, mortgage assistance, attorney referrals and communications, walk-thrus, emails, communications with other Realtor&#039;s and the list goes on.&nbsp; But, if something goes wrong with the financing or the board rejects the buyer there is no closing and I do not get paid.&nbsp; And we&#039;re back to square one.&nbsp; <br /><br />So I can actually wait for three to six months, spend 50-75 hours on the transaction and then find out that the buyer has been unable to secure financing and/or has been board denied.&nbsp; And that is the luck of the trade.<br /><br />Now, if there is a closing, and a commission of 5% has been negotiated with the seller and the unit is 300K the commission will be $15K.&nbsp; Of that <span class="bbc_u"><strong>$15K </strong> </span> commission check a split will go to my broker, and a split will go towards taxes.&nbsp; The remaining balance is my cut.<br /><br />Now if there is a closing, and another Realtor brought the buyer, the commission will be 2.5% or $7.5K.&nbsp; Of that <span class="bbc_u"><strong>$7.5K</strong></span> commission check, a split will go to my broker, and a split will go towards taxes.&nbsp; The remaining balance is my cut.<br /><br />And that is my life as a Realtor in a nutshell.&nbsp; So I will continue to work as a Realtor with those that appreciate my time, honesty, and hard work.&nbsp; I enjoy spending time with my children and I&#039;m so very proud that I can pay the college tuition for my son.&nbsp; <br /><br />Know that many respect and appreciate Realtor&#039;s and I have established many great relationships along the way.<br />Chemistry is always key in real estate transactions, so if you don&#039;t find someone that you like and work well with, move on to someone else.&nbsp; There are many people out there that are terrific at what they do.<br /><br />There are three sides to every story.&nbsp; I&#039;ve shared mine!!<br /><br />To be continued . . .<br /><br />Best,&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Good morning to all:<br /><br />Regarding:&nbsp; &quot;she brings them in for the kill&quot;<br /><br />This may not apply to me as I don&#039;t do rentals.&nbsp; If I did rentals, I would collect one month&#039;s broker&#039;s commission fee which would be example: $1,200.&nbsp; Of that amount a split would go to my broker and I would have to set aside a portion for my taxes.&nbsp; <br /><br />So I guess you are correct I would bring them in for the kill and make a $300 profit when all is said and done.&nbsp; <br /><br />To be continued . . .

				dunno, maybe you guys are bad at doing research and finding places on your own. So in that case, yeah, you would need to get a broker. I&#039;ve listed places that I rent out plenty of times on Craigslist (no fee) and know many other homeowners who do the same. <br /><br />In fact, if a broker tries to call me to take a look at what I am renting out, I tell them no since I don&#039;t trust them and their &quot;qualified&quot; tenants.

I have seen a few good places that I liked, but I really do not want to pay a month&#039;s extra rent nor do I want to pay 15% of my annual rent to someone for essentially doing nothing except put me in contact with the person I am actually paying rent to. <br /><br />I may get flamed for this, but from what I am seeing, these guys do nothing but swoop in and claim apartments as their own exclusive listing, and then rent them to you at a ridiculous markup, calling it a &quot;broker&#039;s fee&quot;. In this day and age, it is not difficult to go online, find a listing and go see it yourself- I simply do not understand how a broker justifies charging an exorbitant fee for doing something I could just as easily do myself. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hope you have found something interesting in this thread. I like seeing the question and some of the responses. <br />Just noting, only used a broker once, and that was actually beneficial for all involved. I dont think the wonderful landlord would have been as comfortable renting to us otherwise.<br />We did not know Astoria very well and saw a surprising number of terrible places. But we ended up on a great block and I thought the charges and fees were in the end reasonable with the timeline.<br /><br />After that, it has largely been dumb fortune and knowing better the area and offerings. [like a crazy episode of Seinfeld.]<br />I sympathize with the question. If friends were moving to Astoria for the first time, I would think they would probably use a listing agent and hopefully get a fair deal.<br />Of course it would be nicer to deal with owners directly. It is great when that works out.

				NYC Native: Don&#039;t take it so personally.&nbsp; You have to know by now that there are a ton of shady and lazy rental brokers out there (for example when I was apartment hunting, the first broker we went to laughed at us and just said &quot;there are no apartments available in Astoria&quot; and never called us).&nbsp; Nobody&#039;s talking about you personally.&nbsp; Some posts here might have been worded poorly out of frustration, but I think we all realize that in general brokers do actually do work.&nbsp; But it&#039;s work done for the landlord and not as much for the renter, so it seems unfair to make the renter pay the fees when the landlord is the one who benefits from the work.<br /><br />casicua: I guess you have your answer as to why brokers exist.&nbsp; I think the real question now is why the renter almost always has to pay the full broker fee if the broker is doing most of the legwork for the landlord.

				Do rental brokers exist outside of the NYC metro area?&nbsp; I still find the concept to be rather foreign.&nbsp; I mean, you get a real estate agent if you need to buy a home, but for rentals?&nbsp; It seems like a fishy system. The whole credit check thing is also bizarre.

				Sorry guys, sometimes I see things out there and it makes me quite upset.&nbsp; @ MaC As per my information...it is as accurate it gets...Just like brokers, every situation is different and while <span class="bbc_u">some</span> rent stabilized units pay near &#039;fair market&quot; the vast majority are not. ...Outside of the city wide increases due to forces beyond anyones control such as fuel, insurance and taxes If you got a rent increase that large it was because your landlord made an application but he / she had to prove to the agency why the increase was substantial - You can look into it closer by contacting DHCR. I dont believe the elderly, the sick and thse with very limited income should ever be afraid of losing their roof over their heads but I think that those paying half of what the market commands.... :?<br /><br />@ Speebs, you are right I took it somewhat personal, I tried renting for a while years ago and it was not easy and it could get really ugly and since I didn&#039;t need the money I just stopped.&nbsp; Between callers posing as renters when they were simply window shopping or Salespeople posing as renters so they could find out who your contact was I could not handle the Drama.&nbsp; One of the things you learn in the business is to pick and chose who you show apartments to...I&#039;m not good at that so I gave up the rental drama.&nbsp; I read lots of stuff here that is really fun and informative but then you get the malicious or what may sound like a malicious attempt to trash someone or a group of people or maybe an industry by generalizing and I think it is unfair.&nbsp; I understand that people have their own views and experiences thus opinions will vary but I just could not understand how someone could not find an apartment with no fee for months.&nbsp; @ Casicua, disregard my tone...not meant to be offensive...My Bad.&nbsp; <br /><br />On another note - I have met and known salespeople that after a conversation with them I want to go home and shower...but in all fairness most of the wacko realtors out there are salespeople that have picked up bad habits from others.&nbsp; There is a huge percentage of unlicensed people out there selling real estate.&nbsp; I could go on and on but I don&#039;t want to get lynched... :ugly:
