				A friend of mine living in Jackson Heights informed me today that he was told he has to be out of his apartment by Monday.<br /><br />Apparently, he has been subletting a two bedroom co-op.&nbsp; The co-op was not be subletted, unbeknownst to my friend.&nbsp; The co-op board discovered the owner was not living in the apartment and he has gotten in trouble and now the owner has told my friend today, that he has until Monday to move out.&nbsp; Undoubtably, giving someone only four days notice to move is morally wrong, especially when the owner is the party at fault, but the question is, is this even <strong>legal </strong> for him to do so?&nbsp; My friend did not sign any sort of lease.&nbsp; Had I of known him at the time that he had rented this place, I would have told him to have some sort of document drawn up to protect him just in case.&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t aware the whole deal was rather under the table.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyways, I just want to know if he has any possible legal recourse.&nbsp; I&#039;m not quite sure why the owner is insisting that he must be out BY Monday rather than giving him at least a week or two.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure what threats the co-op board leveled at him exactly.&nbsp; I was under the impression however that there was something out there, some sort of law that protects even illegal subletters in situations such as this.&nbsp; <br /><br />Any ideas?

				http://www.nycourts.gov/courts/nyc/housing/pdfs/tenantsguide.pdf (http://www.nycourts.gov/courts/nyc/housing/pdfs/tenantsguide.pdf)<br /><br />I will have to agree with QMC here. The key word is &quot;illegal&quot;.<br /><br />Also: http://www.housingnyc.com/html/resources/faq/co-ops.html#sublet (http://www.housingnyc.com/html/resources/faq/co-ops.html#sublet) see where it says this:<br /><br /><strong>Can I sublet a co-op?<br /><br />This depends. Co-ops are not truly &quot;owned&quot; by the purchaser. Rather, shares of stock in co-op buildings are purchased, giving the &quot;owner&quot; tenancy rights in the unit purchased. The lease is known as a &quot;proprietary lease&quot; and operates generally the same way as a regular lease. Thus, the shareholder of a co-op is also a tenant. However, co-op tenants do not have statutory rights to sublet like other tenants. Whether a co-op unit may be sublet depends on the policies of the co-op board.<br /><br />Some co-ops allow shareholder/tenants to sublet their apartments. Others strictly forbid or regulate such practices. Co-op sublets are not subject to rent stabilization. The rights and obligations of the parties are generally spelled out in the sublet agreement subject to the terms of the shareholder/tenant’s &quot;proprietary lease&quot; and the co-op’s governing rules.</strong><br /><br />

				While I agree that since this was an illegal sublet, he can be evicted.&nbsp; BUT I would assume that he would be provided by the standard 1 month notice of intent to evict.&nbsp; Eitherway, if your friend is going to be there on tuesday he prob. should talk to a lawyer about protecting his rights.

				This doesn&#039;t seem to be a typical &#039;illegal&#039; sublet where a tenant tries to get one over on his or her landlord. It&#039;s appears to be a case of a landlord taking advantage of his business partners, the other owners in the building.<br /><br />If subletting isn&#039;t allowed in terms of the by-laws that govern the building where the apartment is located then it&#039;s shame on the owner. This is common with coops and it’s the owner/landlord who violated the terms of his lease -- not your friend the tenant (and the owner knew it hence no lease).<br /><br />From the link that BentleysDad posted, by law, a person has four business days (not counting weekends and holidays) to vacate an apartment after being served an eviction notice (that was news to me). Your friend does have legal recourse though to stop the eviction but the clock is ticking and he needs to go to court and file papers to stop it so maybe a lawyer is a good idea.<br /><br />Most likely your friend would get a hearing and a judge will decide how long to give him to find another place to live -- it could be four days or it possibly could run up to six months.<br /><br />It doesn’t matter if the apartment is rent regulated or in a co-op or in a house. <br /><br />The coop board and what they do is the owner/landlord’s problem. I imagine they have the right to fine him or her for violating the building’s by-laws by illegally subletting. Your friend should keep out of it and concentrate his efforts on finding a new place to live because he will have to go eventually. <br /><br />Lesson learned: sign a lease!<br /><br />I hope it works out for your friend DnB.<br />

				It is ILLEGAL. While my current circumstances are different from yours, I too am dealing with someone trying to illegally evict me from my apartment. Here is the link you can click on to get started learning what your rights are and what steps you need to do IMMEDIATELY in order to put a stop to this process. If this individual does in fact manage to evict you within the next few days, you still have rights and need to follow the instructions EXACTLY as they are written by the courts. Not properly following the instructions can in fact void whatever decision the judge makes in your favor.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the link and best of luck!<br /><br />http://www.courts.state.ny.us/courts/nyc/housing/stopeviction.shtml

				The RPL prohibits a certain number of people who are UNRELATED from inhabiting the same domicile. <br />Now, if we enforced that law in this once-residential Astoria you can imagine the results: the dorms filled with Midwestern college kids and the migrant workers would be vacant, the wages would rise and the cost of living would go down and Manhattan would be deprived of its cheap labor supply.
