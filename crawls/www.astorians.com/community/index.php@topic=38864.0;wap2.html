			Hello All.. <br /><br />I just heard that a child attending Diki Daycare on 37th St. and 30th Ave was found outside by a someone who was walking by the establishment.&nbsp; I also heard the daycare was temporarily closed but has resumed business. How did the child get out?&nbsp; Does anyone have any insight as to why this establishment is still in business?&nbsp; :angry: I cannot believe this happened!!! My heart goes out to the family of the child that was found and any child that attends there!! Praise to the persons who found the child, they need to be awarded in many ways! Over the last few months 3 daycares in the neighborhood have closed and now this, what other options do we have as Astoria so with children???
