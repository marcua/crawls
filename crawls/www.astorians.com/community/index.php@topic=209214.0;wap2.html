			<br />“The Long and Short of It” is a monthly storytelling show and open mic in Jackson Heights. Come to hear master storytellers tell and share stories that will put you in suspense, change your thoughts on the world as you think of it today, or just give you another perspective on what somewhat else has experienced. And you can put your name in our bucket to participate in our open mic by telling a story of your own. <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;“The Long and Short of It” is hosted by Nancy Goldman, producer and host of “Come Over For Coffee,” a storytelling home concert in Jackson Heights. In addition to performing at The New York Story Exchange and Word The Storytelling Show she has presented a TedX talk about the power of personal storytelling and teaches a course about storytelling in organizations at New York University. <br />&nbsp;<br />We are often asked who attends these shows and what to expect. If you like stories, are inquisitive about other people&#039;s lives and enjoy meeting new and interesting New Yorkers then this is for you. Shows are held on the third Monday of the month (9/16) from 7pm to 8:30pm at Terraza 7 located at 40-19 Gleane Street, near 83rd Street and Roosevelt Avenue. You can purchase tickets at the door or email heightshub@gmail.com for ticket information.
