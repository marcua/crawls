				So this woman attempted to rent an apartment from them and gave them $5400 for 1st month&#039;s rent ($1800), security and broker fee.&nbsp; However, she didn&#039;t have a lease.&nbsp; Then he said the rent was now $1900.&nbsp; After, she became suspicious, she called the landlord directly for the apartment and he had no record of her renting the apartment and said that the rent wasn&#039;t 1900 it was 2300 and it was already rented to someone else. <br /><br />She went to get her money back from Evans Realty and they gave her 3600 in cash and a check that bounced for 1800.&nbsp; &nbsp;Then he gave her some BS (on a hidden camera) about why he &quot;bounced the check on purpose&quot;.&nbsp; <br /><br />It was great...Arnold Diaz did his research and posted quotes from what looked like Astorians about people complaining about Evans Realty.&nbsp; I DVR&#039;d it so I will have to get a better look.&nbsp; They also exposed how the guy there stole peoples identity and plead guilty for it.&nbsp; <br /><br />They ended up getting this woman&#039;s money back after all kinds of efforts not to.&nbsp; It got rather &quot;aggressive&quot; at the end with lots of yelling. <br /><br />Nice job Arnold!&nbsp;

				Thanks for getting the word out. &nbsp;People like this should be put out of business. &nbsp;Sadly, for some reason, they are allowed to continue operating, so the only way to obtain justice is to get the word out to as many people as possible.

				I have always said that the Realty business is the most lax business in the U.S. (especially NYC) in terms of regulation.&nbsp; Even the oil industry is better regulated...and that&#039;s an industry that CLEARLY needs more regulation.<br /><br />People are so willing most of the time to put up what realtors have to say and even if you question thier business practices, the common answer is &quot;well, that&#039;s ust how real estate works&quot;; or something akin to that.<br /><br />To me, that&#039;s crap.&nbsp; <br /><br />Money like this should immediately have be held in an escrow account where the rented would have placed the money into DRIECTLY; there should be no need to hand any money directly to the realtor.&nbsp; When the transaction is finished, THEN the realtor would be allowed to take thier fee from the escrow account, not before.<br /><br />But if you ask any realtor, this type of setup would be &quot;horrible and detrimental to thier business&quot; (or some other BS like that).&nbsp; At the very least, harsher laws should be in place to punish those realtors who missapropriate money in this fashion.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />To bad the real estate lobby is so strong.&nbsp; And the worse part is, most people seem not to care about this issue.

				These guys are such trash- I despise the entire NY Real Estate broker industry.<br /><br />The system should be that you go with a building management company or just rent straight from the landlord.

The entire business is shady, and most of these clowns are the reason NYC real estate prices are out of control.

				Thanks for sharing the link to the Shame On You segment - awesome job on Arnold Diaz&#039;s part, and good for that lady for sticking to her guns and sticking up for herself, resulting in the deserved cash wad at the end. &nbsp;<br /><br />What losers these people at Evan&#039;s Corner Realty are! &nbsp;All of them in that office - they act like animals. &nbsp;I&#039;m disgusted. The level of douchery that went on in that office is off the charts. &nbsp;I hope they lose their license and have to close up shop and that &quot;Yanos&quot; (sp?) goes to jail.

				I normally hate these sensationalist &quot;Shame On You!&quot;-esque segments, but wow. What a shyster. I&#039;ve had the opportunity to help a couple friends get apartments in the city directly from the landlord/management, but when all else fails, I&#039;ve said, &quot;yeah, you&#039;ve really gotta use a broker.&quot; I hope none of them went to Evan&#039;s. Ugh.<br /><br />An old roommate&#039;s family owned a couple small buildings in Chicago, and she was floored when she realized what the situation is here. Out there, the landlords pay the brokers, not the tenants. It&#039;s a screwed up system we have.

				Well usually who ever does give the money first or deposit first gets the apt . I mean unless they have a huge credit problem or something was really wrong , if an interested person or couple leaves a deposit on the spot , the apt is pretty much theres.

				So the conclusion to our saga with Evan&#039;s Corner Realty; my exhusband and our son did NOT get the apartment they put the deposit down on.&nbsp; Suddenly, although vacant, it is not going to be ready until the end of July which does not work.&nbsp; So the manager faxed over a lease to a different apartment that neither my son nor my exhusband has seen because they are still out here in California.&nbsp; Out of options at this point, they took it.&nbsp; For all they know, it faces a brick wall!&nbsp;

				We went there last week to check out some listings and sure enough, it is the same guy as in the fox5 clip.&nbsp; He had an apartment to show us but lucky for us he was unable to keep any appointments.&nbsp; Glad that fell through before it was too late.&nbsp; Jeez.

				They&#039;re not good people.&nbsp; (understatement)<br /><br />I have their office phone, and cell phones in my phone&#039;s memory, so whenever they call to see if they can show an apartment in one of the buildings I take care of, I just don&#039;t answer.<br /><br />The one time a few months ago when they used a new number, (I made the appointment not knowing it was them,&nbsp; they said it&#039;s so-and-so from &quot;the real estate&quot; so now I ask which office) I brought up the shame on you thing and they weren&#039;t even slightly mortified that it happened.&nbsp; No remorse at all.<br /><br />They actually rented the apartment and my new tenant said that while he was in their office (on two occasions) there were people in there arguing about getting deposits back.&nbsp; &nbsp;So it&#039;s business as usual.

				Any time I have clients mention Evans or &quot;Eres&quot; i tell them to look up the fox 5 segment and warn them.&nbsp; I am quite honestly&nbsp; Extremely Surprised that they are still in business much less the same people.&nbsp;

				I&#039;m currently dealing with this guy.&nbsp; I had no idea about his history until tonight.&nbsp; I was supposed to move in on the 1st of October and I have been getting the run around ever since. If he gives me trouble about getting my money back I am going to take legal action.&nbsp; I am curious if he owes anyone else on this forum any money. If so, I think we should work together to try and get legal results.&nbsp; I&#039;m not educated on the subject, but something along the lines of a joint lawsuit seems like a good idea.&nbsp; Legal fees could be split evenly.&nbsp; I am still going to try and retrieve my money without having to go through all this, but my chances seem slim.&nbsp; If anyone is in the same position as myself, and is interested in what I have mentioned, please post a reply on this forum. Thank you.

				I saw him standing on the corner just a few days ago.&nbsp; I&#039;d make extra efforts to get your money before he&#039;s sentenced. <br /><br />Legal action and bad press hasn&#039;t seemed to effect his habits, so best of luck to you.&nbsp;

				Long story short: we got our money back after threatening legal action.&nbsp; We got the money in cash and signed/notarized a document saying we wouldn&#039;t pursue legal action against them.<br /><br />I got the impression that they know the heat is on and they don&#039;t want more legal trouble.&nbsp; And I think we gave the impression that we knew what we were doing and would be more trouble than we were worth.<br /><br />My advice to anyone dealing with them is: seem like you mean business.<br />

				I&#039;m glad to hear that people are getting their money back. I&#039;m going to have to go to the office today and try to get mine back as well. I&#039;ll post my results.&nbsp; I&#039;m glad this forum exist, and if I can actually get an apartment in Astoria I&#039;ll be an active member.

				Good ole Arnold Diaz was back at Evan&#039;s Corner Realty or Astoria Home Realty, whatever it is called now.&nbsp; The show aired two nights ago.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />It seems that the main guy Veevos is not in Federal prison for two years and owes about 3/4 of a million in retribution. <br />&nbsp;<br />Vallone was on TV thanking Diaz for helping bring this guy to light.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Thankfully, he won&#039;t be scamming people anymore...or for now at least.&nbsp;
