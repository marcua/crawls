				I thought it was strange that this restaurant closed so suddenly so I called and there is a recording that they will be closed for renovations for 3 weeks.&nbsp; I love this restaurant.&nbsp; It is very homey and cozy and the food is delicious.&nbsp; The owner is very nice and they never rush you to leave.&nbsp; I highly recommend this restaurant

				I&#039;m hopeful that the renovation recording is the true story.&nbsp; The place had a poor layout and the paint job on the interior was horrid!&nbsp; We would really enjoy their pizzas, more so in the restaurant than delivery, but delivery wasn&#039;t bad either.&nbsp; The did an amazing grilled steak, some of the veal dishes were great, and shrimp franchaise was also a winner!<br /><br />

				It sounds like the new owners are up and running and a few good reviews so far.&nbsp; I plan to try it very soon.&nbsp; Nice that they have a real bar too.&nbsp; There isn&#039;t a place within blocks of this location (other than Thai Pavillion next door) where you can sit and have a drink.<br />&nbsp;http://www.yelp.com/biz/palermo-restaurant-and-bar-new-york (http://www.yelp.com/biz/palermo-restaurant-and-bar-new-york)

				Da Franco&#039;s was a great little restaurant. Shame to hear it&#039;s gone as I&#039;ve been out of the area for a while. What&#039;s the new place like?

				I used to love Da Franco&#039;s and was so sad when it closed.&nbsp; It&#039;s been closed for a while now. The new restaurant Palermo just isn&#039;t the same. I went there once and never went back

				I find that so interesting.&nbsp; To me, Da Franco&#039;s was awful.&nbsp; The food was wildly unpredictable.&nbsp; The owner seemed shifty.&nbsp; The d√©cor was horrible.&nbsp; I love Palermo and I like that they have a little cocktail lounge area.&nbsp; I think their pizza&#039;s and food are very good.&nbsp; They are pretty full nearly every night so they definitely have fans.&nbsp; Maybe try it again.&nbsp; And the new Meet the Meat next door is also quite good.
