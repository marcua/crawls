				Hi everyone, <br /><br />It&#039;s my first holiday season in Astoria and I&#039;m wondering where people are buying their christmas trees. I live near the intersection of 30 Ave. &amp; Crescent St. <br /><br />Thanks in advance and happy trimming!<br />-m

				30th Ave has a few places. I got mine in front of the Rite Aid on 33rd St last year and probably will again this year.<br />

				Not sure what you mean by &quot;real trees&quot; but live trees (as in, not plastic and they smell like they&#039;re real) are sold all over our neighborhood, especially near the pharmacies. Like the previous poster mentioned at that cross street near the Rite Aid. I&#039;ve also seen them in the triangle at Northern Blvd. near the shopping areas, also near the other Rite Aid towards Steinway.

				This will be my first year getting a real tree here in Astoria, and I&#039;m wondering (for those of you who have gotten them) how long do they normally last.&nbsp; Would I be okay getting it now or should I wait a week or two?&nbsp; &nbsp;All my experience with real Christmas trees involves cutting down ourselves at a farm, and I understand those usually last longer.

				I&#039;ve been getting my tree at the stand in front of the Rite Aid (30th Ave &amp; 33rd St.) for at least the past 4 years, and I&#039;ve always been happy with it. When I went over that way yesterday, I noticed they&#039;re open for business (they usually set up right after Thanksgiving).<br /><br />I usually get a 6-foot tall tree, and I think it usually runs between $25-40 (price depends on the quality of the tree). I usually get mine in early December, and as long as you keep it watered, it should last thru Christmas. (if you let the water completely dry up, even once, it won&#039;t last)<br /><br />I would suggest stopping by to check out the selection-- and if you don&#039;t see one you like, stop back in a couple days. They seem to always be getting fresh shipments in, so the stock will vary from day to day.<br />

				This won&#039;t help the OP, but for those in the Ditmars area looking for a tiny tree (like one you could put on a table), I got one from in front of the Rite Aid last year and was very happy with it. Don&#039;t remember how long it lasted, but I think I got it in mid-December.

				I got my tree (fake) from Fortunoff&nbsp; in LongIsland last yr the day after x-mas . It was like 75 % off&nbsp; and originally it cost over $500. So i think i got a&nbsp; good deal .&nbsp; Funny if they can still make a profit after 75%&nbsp; off imagine how much of a profit they make when they sell it&nbsp; with no discount being applied .

				Bought our live tree and xmas wreaths three years in a row at Steinway and 31st, by Rite Aid. The guys are from Newfoundland are always really nice. <br /><br />No more messy cleanup though - We&#039;ve invested in a fake one. <br /><br />http://www.holidaytree.com/Christmas-Trees_64_209.htm<br />Made in the USA, wow, imagine that! We got the 7.5&#039; Mountain Fir. It&#039;s cute and shaggy.&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br />

				I bought mine in the parking lot of C-Town on Broadway and 28th Street. The people selling them are Canadians (French-speaking). If you find one for $25 let me know-- I don&#039;t think so! I paid almost $50 last year. <br /><br />They used to sell them on Northern Boulevard near the 36th Avenue Stop on the R train. No one goes there and it&#039;s out of the way, but they were a bit cheaper. <br /><br />
