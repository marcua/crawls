				We&#039;re finally biting the bullet and hiring a housekeeper. Have any recommendations for someone to come in every week or two? Our place is kind of big, so it would be a relatively juicy gig.<br /><br /><br />Advice on fees appreciated too. The last time I considered this was 10 years ago, and I can&#039;t even remember what people were asking then.<br /><br /><br />Thanks.

				I&#039;ve used Carmen for years.&nbsp; She does a great job and is very reliable.&nbsp; Her number is 347-553-3548.<br />As far as pricing, it really depends on the size of your place and the frequency you want her to come.&nbsp; I believe Carmen would quote you fair price.

				I have a close friend who cleans houses and I could not live without him. He comes to my apt. every other week. I recently moved to Astoria and he managed my entire move. I have a one bedroom and he charges $80, so depending on the size of your place he may or may not charge more than that. I highly recommend him as someone who is honest, trustworthy, dependable and just an all around nice person. He also works parties or does personal assistant work, etc. I recommended him to my boss at work and now he uses him every week and one of his neighbors is now also using him! Everyone loves Chuck. Please give him a call at 646.483.6202 and tell him you were referred by Judith. If you need more info or want to talk to me as a reference please email me and I&#039;m happy to chat. I&#039;ll always have lots of good things to say about Chuck, who has made my life SO much easier over the years!
