				I would like a good Chinese restaurant. &nbsp;Not the storefront/takeout crap that is everywhere. &nbsp;Somewhere to sit down and eat if I want to but a place that would also deliver. &nbsp;It doesn&#039;t have to be fancy..just not crap. &nbsp;Something along the lines of Evergreen Shanghai on 38st in the city would be great. &nbsp;Flushing is not so close and I just don&#039;t understand why we have no decent Chinese in Astoria. &nbsp;<br /><br />for the record, i have found that Kitaku (the Japanese restaurant) has the best Chinese I can find in Astoria. &nbsp;Not saying it is great...but the best around. &nbsp;+1 for having steamed Pork Buns also. &nbsp;I normally don&#039;t go the route of a Chinese/Japanese place...but Kitaku is had pretty good Chinese food for the area. &nbsp;Their Japanese food however, I find to be rather bad. &nbsp;

				I second Yaxpac on Chinese.&nbsp; Takeout chinese (or as I call it &quot;cheap chewy Chinese&quot;, just a random third word that starts with Ch) is a frequent fallback but once in a while it would be nice to be able to have a nice sit down meal with waiters.&nbsp; I did find out Sampan on Steinway (my girlfriend loves this place) serves on real plates with silverware if you dine in but it&#039;s still fast food-ish to me although very good.<br /><br />I would also like a good maybe slightly upscale Mexican restaurant.&nbsp; I would like something in the vein of Las Margaritas except you know, good.&nbsp; Something that resembles my two favorites in Manhattan (Viva Pancho on 44th and 7th and Maz Mezcal on 86th and 2nd).

				&quot;Want to see a river of orchids where they had a motorway.&quot; - XTC<br /><br />Failing that, yeah, good-quality eat-in Chinese would be nice.&nbsp; Americanized Chinese is fine, as long as it&#039;s good.&nbsp; Vietnamese would be great, too.&nbsp; And a coffeehouse like (RIP) Soleil.&nbsp; I&#039;m told, though, that the profit margin on coffeehouses is too small for such a high-rent neighborhood.

				We actually do have a bookstore called Seaburn Books on Broadway and a Mexican restaurant on Steinway and Northern Blvd called Tequila Sunrise that is more upscale.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m not sure what else I&#039;d like to see..<br /><br />An HSBC branch<br />Trader Joe&#039;s <br />a real Organic market or farmer&#039;s market, not a store with a &quot;section&quot; for it, and I would like it to be affordable, why should organic strawberries have to $6 or more???&nbsp; <br />a Korean BBQ restaurant<br />Vietnamese restaurant<br />A wifi co-working space for us freelancers or at least a good coffeehouse that won&#039;t mind me hanging out all day (I will buy food and coffee)<br />

				Thanks!&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)<br /><br />I&#039;m looking forward to seeing what their stock and prices are like.<br /><br />I&#039;d love to see another, larger, bookstore (or one that is more responsive to the community).&nbsp; I&#039;d also like a good Indian restaurant closer to Ditmars.&nbsp; Vietnamese would also be awesome.&nbsp; And a loungy coffeehouse with comfortable couches, etc. (and maybe a small selection of good food and wi-fi.)

				Love the idea of a Vietnamese restaurant!&nbsp; A loungy, west-coast style coffeehouse would be really nice.&nbsp; A cheese shop would also be a welcome addition for me.&nbsp; And yes, a larger bookstore.&nbsp; I do not agree that Seaburn totally sucks, just depends on what you&#039;re looking for when you enter.

				haha. yeah. I think they have about 5 minutes experience with ice cream. I felt guilty for making them walk over to get me a cup, and her arm was shaking as she struggled to get the ice cream out of the bucket.<br />Also when I asked what something tasted like she put it in her ice cream scooper and like held it out like i was going to eat it right of it! hmmmm.

				* A comfy neighborhood coffee shop along the lines of what Freeze Peach used to be.&nbsp; I can do the Euro cafe and/or Starbucks/Brooklyn Bagel thing if I have to but I would LOVE a real old school coffee shop.&nbsp; Happened to visit Sweetleaf in LIC a couple of weekends ago and fell in love right away.&nbsp; Wish we had one of those.<br />* A bookstore.&nbsp; Or a combination coffee shop bookstore.&nbsp; How great would that be!&nbsp; I would go there all the time and spend lots of money there (entrepeneurs and potential small business owners, are you reading this?)<br />* As others have said, a more centrally located CSA.&nbsp; I especially would dig finding it easier to get my hands on organic meats in Astoria.<br />* Better Chinese food<br /><br />So I took a new Astoria resident on a tour of the neighborhood this past weekend.&nbsp; I swear it took her no less than half an hour to say the following phrases: &quot;We need a bookstore&quot; and &quot;We need better Chinese food.&quot;&nbsp; I let her know she was hardly alone in that assessment.&nbsp;
