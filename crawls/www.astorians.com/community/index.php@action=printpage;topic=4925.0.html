				Hey all,<br /><br />I am desperately looking for a great steakhouse tonight.&nbsp; It&#39;s a special day with m&#39;lady and we would love to share a Porterhouse for two.&nbsp; Price is not a big issue on this evening.&nbsp; Location is not a first priority either.&nbsp; I would like to be able to drive there and park easily, so Queens or Brooklyn would work best (hopefully within 20 minutes of Asotria).&nbsp; Of course I tried Lugers, and of course they are booked up solid.<br /><br />Any advice?<br /><br />Thanks!!<br />Adam

				I&#39;m sure it;s too late but Jackson ave steakhouse has excellent steaks. Christos steakhouse comes highly recommended and the Chef shops at Marinos fish and International meats.&nbsp; She is supposed to be a top nothc chef who knows her stuff.

				By any chance, were you one of those people who ended up in front of Top Tomato tonight and asked one of the employees there where Christos is? If so, I was there. It was kind of funny. Sorry.&nbsp; :wink:

				OK, here it is.&nbsp; We made a reservation at Christos.&nbsp; The Porterhouse for 2 is $67, which is expensive...but can get much pricier at other places.&nbsp; Add on an app and their cheapest bottle of wine ($34), however, and it&#39;s getting up there.&nbsp; Of course, I said in my original post that price wasn&#39;t a big deal, and it wasn&#39;t, but when it came time to go...we felt like something more casual.&nbsp; <br /><br />We ended up at Tournesol on Jackson Ave.&nbsp; It&#39;s a great, small French place we&#39;ve been to a couple times.&nbsp; Good news is the food was excellent.&nbsp; We each got the steak frittes, and they do it perfectly!&nbsp; Bad news is that our 8:30 reservation got us seated at 9:30.&nbsp; We spent the extra hour at their wine bar (same owner, I believer) two doors down.&nbsp; Truthfully, it was really quite nice - I&#39;d just prefer it on my terms.&nbsp; I don&#39;t mind waiting 20 minutes or so after a reservation, but an hour is a bit much.&nbsp; A great meal, nonetheless.<br /><br />We&#39;ll definately try Christos another night when we&#39;re feeling a bit more, um, classy.&nbsp; I also want to check out Jackson Steakhouse.<br /><br />Thanks so much everyone for the recommendations!

				Well, I&#39;m not quite sure the name of it, but it is two doors from Tournesol, which is 5012 Vernon Blvd in LIC.&nbsp; I wrote Jackson Ave above, but that&#39;s not correct...it&#39;s almost at the intersection of Vernon and Jackson, but definately on Vernon.<br /><br />They only have wine, and I believe maybe one beer on tap.&nbsp; Wines are available by the glass ($7 and up), the carafe ($16 and up), and the bottle ($24 and up).&nbsp; Rather than bar peanuts, you are served some great olives while you sip your wine.&nbsp; They also have a nice looking cheese menu and raw bar selection.&nbsp; Strangely, there is a foosball table in the back.<br /><br />The place isn&#39;t huge, but it&#39;s very laid back and comfortable.&nbsp; Dim lighting and warm - both in a good way.<br /><br />Hope that helps.&nbsp; Definately worth a visit.

				The wine bar is:<br /><br />Domaine<br />50-04 Vernon Blvd<br />718-784-2350<br /><br />Their card says &quot;depuis 1938&quot; -- since 1938, but I&#39;m not sure what that is in reference to, since they just opened this fall.<br /><br />Jim and I ended up there one chilly night in early December because Tournesol was full, and we decided that all we really wanted was wine, cheese and oysters, anyway.&nbsp; We were pleased to see the wines by the glass/carafe/bottle.&nbsp; The wine we had (which I enjoyed but unfortunately did not write down, but I think it was a Spanish white) was $26 per carafe, which I think was 500 ml.&nbsp; The cheese selection I would describe as just this side of daring, but good enough.&nbsp; We had an excellent Camembert.&nbsp; They also have oysters, clams and shrimp.&nbsp; There is no kitchen, but since they are owned by the same guys as Tournesol, there&#39;s a certain amount of running back and forth, and it more or less works. <br /><br />The small cheese plate was $10.50, and a dozen oysters were $24.&nbsp; They had, if I recall, three kinds of oysters the night we were there, including Kumamoto, which were very creamy and contrasted strongly with the sharper east coast oysters.&nbsp; We talked to them about local oysters, and gave them the name of Pipes Cove oysters that are now being grown on the North Fork near Greenport as part of a seed program.&nbsp; I don&#39;t know the range of where they are being sold, but they are delicious, and the guys said they would ask their oyster guy about them.&nbsp; All of the staff were French, and friendly.<br /><br />Towards the back they have high tables to stand or sit at with bar stools, and in front they have two or three small round tables with chairs.&nbsp; Subway tiles on the walls.&nbsp; I&#39;d agree with the afarber&#39;s description of the good dim and warm atmosphere.<br /><br />All in all, I&#39;d say it&#39;s worth checking out.&nbsp; When we went they didn&#39;t take credit cards yet, but were expecting to within a few weeks.&nbsp; I&#39;d like to see a slightly better cheese selection, and more local oysters, but it&#39;s definitely promising.

				That&#39;s it -- just wine, cheese, oysters, clams and shrimp.&nbsp; They serve bread and olives, but if you don&#39;t eat cheese, I don&#39;t think you&#39;d end up with much.
