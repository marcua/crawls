				i've seen a lot of ads for this Fitness Point place... it seems like a good deal.<br /><br />has anyone actually been there and checked it out? &nbsp;is it a nice place? &nbsp;does it offer classes? &nbsp;i want to join a gym but not pay insane monthly prices.<br /><br />i'd also really like to take some pilates classes, preferably close to home (by the NW on 36th ave)... anyone know of some good pilates studios around here as well?<br /><br />thanks!

				Basically you get what you pay for. &nbsp;The gym is a dump. &nbsp;The equipment was bought second hand - most of it has tears in the seats and some of the equipment has serious flaws. &nbsp;I once hurt myself on a machine because it swung free in a way that it shouldn't have been able to. When I went in origianlly to sign up they told me they were fixing up the women's locker room installing a sauna... blah blah blah... a year later... nothing. &nbsp;<br />And I HATE gyms. &nbsp;My experience at Fitness Point didn't help that. &nbsp;I have had positive gym experiences at other places. &nbsp;This wasn't one. &nbsp;<br />But heck... if you need a place to work out indoors... it's cheap. &nbsp;There are machines and free weights and classes. &nbsp;Just be forwarned that if you're there for yoga - you'll hear the grunts and clanging of the gym. &nbsp;But it's cheap. &nbsp;Did I mention it's cheap?<br />Oh yeah... and it reaks. &nbsp;but it's cheap. <br />Jen

				I was a member of the Astoria Sport Center (on 38th st and 35th ave) for a few years. The place is a bit of a dump, but it has all the machinges you could want, AND a swimming pool, and it is very cheap. I also really liked the fact that not everyone there is a 20 or 30 someething jock. It has progams specifically geared towards seniors and kids, which is nice. <br /><br />That said, I don't recommend showering there. but if you are close enough to go home afterwards, it is definitely worth it.

				I've had a good experience in the last year with Synergy on Broadway, it has what I need and they have upgraded their equipment over the year, and I pay $40 a month. &nbsp;I can go pretty much whenever I want, and it's a mixed crowd health/gender/etc. &nbsp;It can fill up but never seems too crowded. &nbsp;It has worked for me and they seem to be sinking cash into the place.
