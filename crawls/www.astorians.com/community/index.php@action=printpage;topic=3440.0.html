				Merm, throw this in the blackhole if you feel the need to, but here goes...<br /><br />A little hypothosis...<br /><br />I believe that Gleason/Gatorboy is probably a slum lord.&nbsp; He NEVER talks about parts of Astoria most of us on this board actually live in.&nbsp; He&#39;s always referring to the western most parts of Astoria, or more accurately, LIC.&nbsp; My guess is he owns a bit of property that he probably doesn&#39;t maintain properly, and is taking advantage of sucking up rent from the tenants over there without fixing any of the places.&nbsp; He simply feels threatend by the prospect of developers coming in and fixing up the neighborhood so he can&#39;t screw people.&nbsp; He really doesn&#39;t actually give a s___t about the neighborhood.&nbsp; He is simply seeking personal gain.&nbsp; He is probably largely responsible for the illegal conversions and the like.<br /><br />If he actually cared about the neighborhood, he would actually try and engage people in conversation instead of hijacking threads and generally being an ass.&nbsp; You don&#39;t rally people to your cause by talking down to them, accuse them of name calling, when that is the practice they actually participate in.

				I personally don&#39;t find any humor in this thread, but that is just my own opinion.<br /><br />While I understand people&#39;s frustration over the development rants, I do feel like this is a real person who, while seems to be focused on development about 95% of the time, actually enjoys participating in this board. I have found their (if indeed are two people) participation to not focus entirely on the development issues, and to be just as helpful and contributing as anyone else&#39;s participation (am referring to the non-development related posts).<br /><br />I figure the best way to not let someone/something on this board annoy you is to just ignore the posts/posters and carry on in the same thread without responding and/or carry on in other threads that are less threatening to one&#39;s blood pressure (although I admit willingly that I get sucked in and pissed off on occasion!).<br /><br />Just my $0.02.

				I&#39;m not laughing either.&nbsp; This aint cool by any standards, and all it would take is a similar attack against any of us to make us see that clearly.&nbsp; If you got an issue with someone along these lines, that should be handled privately, not in a public forum.&nbsp; Jtrane, I can see you&#39;re normally a pretty rational guy, but that stuff is just out of bounds and not something I&#39;d picture you doing (albeit I don&#39;t know you at all, and vice versa).&nbsp; We&#39;re all going to be prone to disagreements every now and then, but that goes beyond disagreement and into the vague territory of attempted character assasination -- which it wouldn&#39;t be if you were to confront this person privately and hash it out that way.&nbsp; You make it public, the insinuation is you&#39;re encouraging others to chime in/pile on/judge this person accordingly.&nbsp; And that&#39;s just not right.<br /><br />Sorry for any preachiness here.&nbsp; I got very little problem with heated debates, or the occasional flare up where two people will get stupid with each other -- it happens to just about all of us, sooner or later.&nbsp; But a flat-out personal attack like that, combined with pure conjecture that&#39;s neither here nor there in the grand scheme of things, leaves me feeling a little spooked by this place.&nbsp; Not the sort of thing I&#39;d want to be the object of, nor the sort of thing I&#39;d want to participate in.

				There is this (though it most likely won&#39;t show up as cute as the others):<br /><br />&nbsp;:-&gt; = biting sarcastic remark<br /><br />though I usually use&nbsp; :wink: since it shows you&#39;re not being entirely serious ... and I use it to cover jokes/sarcasm ... at least that&#39;s what it means to <strong>me</strong> ... (there <em>always</em> exists the danger of misinterpretation, no matter how careful you are or <em>think</em> you are). So, we can all drive ourselves crazy trying to read into what people mean, make assumptions, and offer up reactionary responses, or we can ask the author their intent prior to making a judgment about it. I&#39;d say this is easier to do when the author is well-enough known to the group, I&#39;ve seen newbies get more careful handling than Jtrane has received here ... <br /><br />I think Jtrane&#39;s post was quite ill-considered, but <em>hardly</em> flogging material. Folks are allowed to get frustrated, and plenty of us have made silly or stupid comments from time to time (whether it was on the board or not). What he wrote was not slanderous, even if it seemed close to being that way. I have to agree with Jonathan that the two named in this thread (if they are indeed two&nbsp; :roll:) by being so intractable and dismissive of other&#39;s opinions about the topic of development--to the point of absurdity--opened themselves up to this, to some degree.

If we had proof of G/G&#39;s duplicity and could make legitimite complaints, that would be one thing.

In this case, G/G is saved by his/their anonymity and the fact that &quot;slum lord&quot; can&#39;t get traced back to them. But I still think it was inappropriate, and Josh&#39;s apology (notably, a real apology and not &quot;I&#39;m sorry your feelings were hurt&quot; sort of non-apology) was appropriate. <br /><br />This said, G/G is/are clearly annoying and misguided, and pointing this out at every opportunity will hopefully make him/them sufficiently annoyed to go away and bother some other community at some point, hopefully soon.<br />

				masande, thanks for clarifying about taking Josh&#39;s apology at face value.<br /><br />The comment about familiarizing yourself with the culture of the board was, in my mind, directly connected to your statements about how certain statements seemed to you (&quot;not knowing any of you personally, this <strong>seemed</strong> like a mean-spirited attack on a board member&quot;), and your unfamiliarity with the people here, and the backstory about the Ga/Gl approach to posting in threads (&quot;hijacking&quot; is a term some have used.)&nbsp; It has driven some users here a little bats at times.&nbsp; <br /><br />Perhaps my use of &quot;culture&quot; was not quite correct.<br /><br />I&#39;m not saying that anyone should refrain from posting depending on their familiarity, just that if they do, they may risk misinterpreting what is being said and how it is being said, and then things get confused.&nbsp; We all make mistakes and errors in judgement based on lack of information/familiarity.&nbsp; I know I have.<br /><br />Hope this helps to clarify what I was trying to say!&nbsp; :D<br /><br />I have never seen this question mark that FOX uses.&nbsp; I&#39;ll have to pay more attention....if I ever watch FOX news.

				I think this is getting a touch overblown.&nbsp; All this fuss over little ol&#39; me?&nbsp; As I said earlier, it was meant as a joke.&nbsp; My apology was meant towards the board and all the people on it, not necessarily to the subject I mentioned. It was a joke, and I highly doubt he even gives a crap what I write about him, as I&#39;ve been through this with him before.<br /><br />I have to admit, I really don&#39;t think my opinion is worth this much effort.&nbsp; It really boils down to me being some random dude making a fairly tasteless attempt at humor.<br /><br />Life isn&#39;t always rainbows and tulips and puppies.&nbsp; We&#39;re not always going to read stuff that pleases us.&nbsp; I guess if I&#39;ve challenged some people to think about the context of what these boards mean, and how personal we should take this stuff, then great.&nbsp; But that goes WAY beyond my intentions.<br /><br />A bad joke aimed at an anonymous trouble maker.&nbsp; Period.

				I think everyone should be free to comment on everything and that&#39;s an important thing for the board. &nbsp;I think what Megc was saying (though I could be wrong) is that some of these threads require reading some of the earlier discussions in order to place them in context (and with the huge volume of posting, that is not always possible - especially for people who aren&#39;t totally addicted to Astorians.com). &nbsp;Getting a sense of the board culture (for any board, not just Astorians.com) isn&#39;t something that is ever required, but it does help give one a sense of how snarky and sarcastic people tend to be with each other. &nbsp;It varies a lot from topic to topic, but much of the give-and-take is based on people having met each other in person and having points of reference from in-person meetings.

				Perhaps I should get a lawyer now?&nbsp; I mean, if we can&#39;t make a bad joke about an anonymous person on here without the idea of being sued for libel being presented, maybe I&#39;m the one who doesn&#39;t understand the context of this board.&nbsp; Maybe we should all sign a user agreement.&nbsp; I figure it could take one of two forms.<br /><br />A.

Though I will absolutely not vouch for the behavior of Gleason/Gator, I think it&#39;s important to note that what we all want here is civil discourse. (Speaking in general, not specifically to Jtrane here) If that is indeed what we all want then there&#39;s no excuse for crossing the line ourselves - no excuse. Just because someone misbehaves doesn&#39;t give anyone else a license to do so in response.<br /><br />I&#39;m by no means a perfect example of this, but I think it&#39;s a worthy goal to shoot for.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I concur about being civil, particularly when disagreeing, it&#39;s one of the few ways to keep a level of understanding, even if it is to agree to disagree. And I also agree with a number of other points folks have brought up, as I said, I think the post was ill-advised, and nope, not particularly funny, but ya know there were some <em>very</em> smart mentions of the &quot;slippery slope&quot; squelching this kind of &quot;unpopular&quot; expression of places you on ... I do not ascribe to stomping on all &quot;mean-spirited&quot; thought (but neither do I choose to participate in that behavior myself, that&#39;s the beauty of free will). This is particularly topical as next week is <strong>Banned Book Week</strong> (http://www.booksatoz.com/censorship/banned.htm) and I was really glad to see folks debating how far things should be taken with regard to &quot;limiting&quot; unpopular speech and opinion.<br /><br />However, to your point about &quot;crossing the line ourselves.&quot; I&#39;d agree with this completely had Jtrane&#39;s statement been a direct response to a post or statement by G/G. Because then it would have simply been more of the dismissive discourse that we&#39;ve seen from G/G and would then, for me, fall under the &quot;lowering oneself&quot; category. But, since it&#39;s posted in a separate forum, I do see it more as a rant, diatribe, and yes, a partial hypothesis ... even if it isn&#39;t an especially considered one (we should be so lucky to have only worthy commentary thrown at us--but there again, who&#39;s to say what each of us considers worthy?). He doesn&#39;t really use direct name-calling he says, &quot;being an ass,&quot; which comes close, but is a criticism of a specific behavior that is exhibited on the board, not of the person as a whole.&nbsp; <br /><br />Wouldn&#39;t want it to be done to me, certainly. Though all of us who post are generally fair game (I know a few folks who had to deal with personal attacks on the board by a certain member who was eventually banned ...) And this is what I meant by &quot;bringing it on themselves ...&quot; by simply participating G/G essentially made themselves a &quot;public figure&quot; on the board. Their comments were posted&nbsp; with the knowledge that they would be visible to the board, and when they did that they placed themselves in a position to be criticized and/or lampooned in a similar way that public figures often get &quot;zinged&quot; or find themselves on the cover of <em>The Star</em> or worse. Is this kind of critique distasteful? Sure. Are there a million better ways to try to get a point across? Of course. <br /><br />Finally, though, rather than trying to squelch further thought or commentary by G/G, there is actually a call being made for them to participate in a real dialogue here (even if it was muddled amongst a lot of anger and frustration) and a call for this person to take action on something that is an important topic to the community. So, the post is not <em>entirely</em> without merit ... just ill-conceived.<br /><br /><strong><em>&quot;Libel is an ugly thing.&quot;</em></strong><br /><br />In addition to it not being libelous for the previously noted &quot;anonymity&quot; protection, it was also not libelous because (as far as we know) it&#39;s a false statement. A statement is not libelous if it is <em>opinion that is patently untrue</em> &quot;because factual truth is a defense to a libel claim, an opinion with no &#39;provably false factual connotation&#39; is still protected.&quot;<br /><br />---------<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: Verdana;" class="bbc_font">Okay.

				I&#39;m rather pleased to be Boutros-Boutros Gali (did I spell that right? - I always rather liked him and enjoyed the sound of his name).&nbsp; I think his son was a bit of a scoundrel though, as is my boy cat, Turbo.<br />While I should probably let sleeping things lie, I will wade in one last time.&nbsp; For something to be defamatory and libelous, I believe it would have to be done with malice, as well as be demonstrably untrue.&nbsp; While I doubt anyone posting on Astorians.com is a slumlord, anyone alleging that they had been defamed or libeled would have to publicly identify themselves and come forward, stating their name, who they are and how they were libelled.&nbsp; This is what happened when Paula Jones sued Bill Clinton.&nbsp; She had to come forward and file papers.&nbsp; I don&#39;t think Jtrane was actually trying to imply anyone was a slumlord - he was making a joke, and I think it&#39;s hard to prove libel or defamation when the &quot;defamation&quot; or &quot;libel&quot; was humor, otherwise all our political humorists would be sued all the time.

In part. However ... only <em>part</em>. This is a First Amendment issue (cheers to the Constitution). What I wrote was that Jtrane&#39;s comments could be <em>legally defended</em> and therefore may not be considered libelous in a court of law ... distasteful is not legally binding last I checked ... Here&#39;s the publishing law we must follow (text emphasis mine, throughout):<br /><br /><strong>Libel</strong>:<br /><br />Libel occurs when a false and defamatory statement about an <em>identifiable person</em> is published to a third party, causing injury to the subject&#39;s reputation.<br /><br />A defamatory communication exposes a person to hatred, ridicule, or contempt, lowers him in the esteem of his fellows, causes him to be shunned, or injures him in his business or calling (<em>i.e. tangible harm done</em>). Defamation can take the form of libel - published or broadcast communication - or slander - oral communication.<br /><br /><strong>Defenses</strong>:<br /><br />Truth is generally a complete bar to recovery by any plaintiff who sues for libel. Making sure that any potentially libelous material can be proven true can avoid needless litigation.<br /><br /><em>Opinion is still protected speech under the First Amendment</em>, although the Supreme Court limited the formerly broad reach of opinion protection in Milkovich v. Lorain Journal. The court ruled that there is no separate opinion privilege, but <em>because factual truth is a defense to a libel claim, an opinion with no &quot;provably false factual connotation&quot; is still protected.</em><br /><br />As a result of this decision, courts will examine statements of opinion <em>to see if they are based on or presume underlying facts</em>. If these facts are false or defamatory, the &quot;opinion&quot; statements will not be protected.<br /><br />Although a retraction is not usually considered an absolute defense to a libel claim, it may reduce the damages a defendant must pay if found liable for defamation. Before agreeing to publish a retraction, consult an attorney.<br /><br />--------------------<br /><br /><em>...

Just annoyance at times. Not all the time. Heard through people that the real life Zip! is a nice guy. Just offering another opinion. Not here to censor you. Just saying how I feel at times.
