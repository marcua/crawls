				<br />&nbsp;:-o<br /><br />Ore. gov. starts week on food stamps <br />By JULIA SILVERMAN, Associated Press Writer<br />Wed Apr 25<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />If Gov. Ted Kulongoski seems a little sluggish this week, he&#039;s got an excuse: he couldn&#039;t afford coffee.<br /><br />In fact, the Democratic governor couldn&#039;t afford much of anything during a trip to a Salem-area grocery store on Tuesday, where he had exactly $21 to buy a week&#039;s worth of food â€” the same amount that the state&#039;s average food stamp recipient spends weekly on groceries.<br /><br />Kulongoski is taking the weeklong challenge to raise awareness about the difficulty of feeding a family on a food stamp budget.<br /><br />Accompanied by reporters and food stamp recipient Christina Sigman-Davenport, Kulongoski headed straight for a display of organic bananas, only to have Sigman-Davenport steer him toward the cheaper non-organic variety.<br /><br />The governor pined wistfully for canned Progresso soups, but at $1.53 apiece, they would have blown the budget. He settled instead for three packages of Cup O&#039;Noodles for 33 cents apiece. Kulongoski also gave up his usual Adams natural, no-stir peanut butter for a generic store brand, but drew the line at saving money by buying peanut butter and jelly in the same jar.<br /><br />&quot;I don&#039;t much like the looks of that,&quot; said Kulongoski, 66, staring at the concoction.<br /><br />Other shoppers in the store were bemused by Kulongoski&#039;s quest.<br /><br />&quot;Obviously, he doesn&#039;t shop often,&quot; Barb Sours of Salem said, as Kulongoski bounced around the aisles in search of granola. &quot;He&#039;s all over the place.&quot;<br /><br />Kulongoski did pause to chat with shoppers John and Bonnie White of Salem, telling them all about his $21 limit.<br /><br />&quot;Don&#039;t spend it all in one place,&quot; John White warned.<br /><br />Along the way, Sigman-Davenport, a mother of three who works for the state Department of Human Services and went on food stamps in the fall after her husband lost his job, dispensed tips for shopping on a budget. Scan the highest and lowest shelves, she told the governor. Look for off-brand products, clip coupons religiously, get used to filling, low-cost staples like macaroni and cheese and beans, and, when possible, buy in bulk.<br /><br />At the check-out counter, Kulongoski&#039;s purchases totaled $21.97, forcing him to give back one of the Cup O&#039;Noodles and two bananas, for a final cost of $20.97 for 19 items.<br /><br /><strong>After the hourlong shopping trip, Kulongoski said he was mindful that his week on food stamps will be finite and that thousands of others aren&#039;t so lucky.</strong><br /><br />&quot;I don&#039;t care what they call it, if this is what it takes to get the word out,&quot; Kulongoski said, in response to questions about whether the food stamp challenge was no more than a publicity stunt. &quot;This is an issue every citizen in this state should be aware of.&quot;<br />

(sorry, I like Mr. Booker, and I figured that this is a great opportunity to express it&nbsp; :mrgreen: )<br />

More than a million New Yorkers currently collect food stamps, which average $113 a month for an individual and $200 for a family.<br /><br />In the nation&#039;s first &quot;food stamp challenge,&quot; anti-poverty advocates, politicians and clergy feed themselves for a week on the federal amount given to needy people for food. They are calling on Congress to pump about $20 billion more into the federal food stamp program over five years.<br /><br />&quot;We know that food stamps used to last three to four weeks. Now they last two to three weeks and then the recipients start showing up at soup kitchens,&quot; said Joel Berg, executive director of the New York Coalition Against Hunger in Manhattan.<br /><br />klucadamo@nydailynews.com<br /><br />

				I read the piece on this in the Times. I&#039;ve always been a big fan of &#039;living simply&#039; and food is one of the more surprising areas in ones life where you can eat a relatively healthy diet on a modest income, provided that you can cook and do a little research on nutrition. The big issue with low income food programs seems to be that they offer little in the way of nutrition advice (how to eat healthy on the cheap) other than outlining what foodstamps will or will not pay for. Gov. Kulongoski&#039;s not going to last too long on those Cup-o-Noodle meals.<br /><br />As a vegan (and especially during my starving artist phase), I never had much trouble eating healthy on $100 bucks a month. Carnivores might have a harder time staying in budget, but it&#039;s certainly doable. <br /><br />BTW, according to the HRA, NYC doles out up to $155 bucks a month ($38.75/week) to individuals earning $12,000/year or less, which is better than a lot of places. Let&#039;s see if Bloomie takes the $38 a week challenge!

				Grocery stores in Manhattan are much more expensive on average than those anywhere else, which is probably why nyc gives more money.&nbsp; I agree that healthy living needs to be incorporated into the programs.&nbsp; But I do notice that organic, whole wheat, and healthier options cost more in general at most grocery stores (not fruit/veg stands).&nbsp;

However, I&#039;ve lived all over Manhattan&#039;s less fortunate neighborhoods and was never far from a Bravo/Associated/C-Town/Pathmark where I could cover my grocery needs at a reasonable price. Also, I guess I was referring to eating healthy in a conventional way. Still, there are certain neighborhoods where I simply couldn&#039;t find anything reasonable. I don&#039;t live there anymore.&nbsp; :x<br /><br />I might add that I just joined Hellgate CSA :rock: and will be getting a bounty of organic veggies and conventional fruits for around twenty bucks a week. On food stamps in NYC, that would leave me up to $18 to cover my staples. Not too shabby and quite a healthy shopping cart.

				i just wanted to remind everyone that food stamps is a food supplement program. the program was meant to supplement the purchasing power of the individual and family.&nbsp; so you have about $115 on the EBT (electronic benefit card, or food stamps) card, but if you have some extra cash lying around, you can certainly use that at the register.&nbsp; <br /><br />but still. it is something to think about. because i do not believe it covers non food items such as deoderant, sanitary napkins/ tampons, toothpaste, and household cleaning products, etc... <br /><br />so basically it&#039;s rice, beans, and no frills oatmeal, and you bring your breakfast/ lunch to work everyday. it&#039;s tuff.<br /><br />i did find a website for monthly menus on a budget:<br /><br />http://www.hillbillyhousewife.com/index.htm<br /><br />i dont follow their $45 menu plans etc, but some of their recipes have helped out. interesting stuff on there.
