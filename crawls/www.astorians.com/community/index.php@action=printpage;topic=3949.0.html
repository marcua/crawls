				So this is kind of a touchy subject, but I&#39;m not sure what to do at this juncture, so any advice would be appreciated.&nbsp; I&#39;m sitting here in the library trying to do my work, but two women are very much distracting me.&nbsp; I&#39;m not sure if they&#39;re deaf, but they&#39;re signing to each other.&nbsp; Believe it or not, they&#39;re actually making a lot of noise!&nbsp; One of them is signing furiously and violently such that her upper body keeps whipping around and smashing into the table in front of her and the chair in back of her.&nbsp; A lot of foot shuffling and stamping is also going on.&nbsp; And both women keep breaking into hysterical laughter ever few minutes.&nbsp; This has been going on for about an hour.&nbsp; So, can I say something?&nbsp; I&#39;ve been giving them dirty looks, but so far it&#39;s not working.&nbsp; I&#39;m just not sure if I&#39;ll be crossing some line or breaking some unwritten rule if I tell a couple of deaf people that they&#39;re being too loud...
