				I tried to eat at Aliada last weekend and saw that it was closed for renovations.&nbsp; Anyone have any info on this?&nbsp; Will it be reopening?&nbsp; I didn&#039;t think it needed renovations, but I am hoping it will be even nicer when it reopens (if it will).

				If you look closely, there&#039;s actually two yellow signs from the DOH (one on the door, one on the 30th street side window).&nbsp; They got closed down last week and they proceeded to plaster the windows with similar yellow renovation signs to mask the two DOH ones and then took down a majority of their renovations signs the following day (probably rules about masking the DOH signs).&nbsp; Really sucks for them.&nbsp; Was never personally a fan of the place (the two times we&#039;ve gone there&#039;s been couples in heated arguments/breaking up) but I don&#039;t wish that they&#039;d close either because I have some friends that enjoy the place.&nbsp;

				Yeah, I guess the big renovation signs to draw your eye away from the DoH signs is a common practice.&nbsp; Doral&#039;s Donuts (just a few blocks away) just did a similar a week or so ago.&nbsp; Hopefully both places will get nice face lifts (with better food prep./storage/whatever practices) soon.

				That&#039;s a shame. I like Aliada. The food was good and the prices reasonable. <br /><br />Seems like the DOH has been spending a lot of time in Astoria lately. Similar thing happened with Pinocchio a few weeks back (I posted in it a thread). They covered up their DOH signs as well, then just moved across the street under the Pitaria name.<br /><br />

				It sucks about the DoH thing. Place was decent but not outstanding.&nbsp; I&#039;m surprised about the violations because the kitchen area is right in front of the restaurant and out in the open.<br /><br />Online they only have the results of their last inspection which was on 5/8/2009.&nbsp; They had 82 violation points.&nbsp; I am guessing they had a re-inspection and had not cleared up the issues found on the 5/8 inspection and were shut down if in fact it was a DoH closure.<br /><br />http://167.153.150.32/RI/web/detail.do?method=detail&amp;restaurantId=40878459&amp;inspectionDate=20090508<br /><br />On a side note, is Akti owned by the same people? I was dining at Akti a couple of weeks ago and the bald skinny guy from Aliada (i think he is the manager, maybe the owner) came into Akti to seemingly check on what was going on in the place.
