				Is anyone familiar with the 2007 Medicare Part D Donut Hole coverage? I just spent 2 weeks researching and I can&#39;t find a single carrier who will be covering anything but generics during the Hole. Has anyone found anything different? Please, Oh please, post. November 15th is coming on fast!

				My roommate works for a firm that deals with Medicare.&nbsp; She informed me that any and all information you will need can be found at www.medicarerights.org which is usually a private website.&nbsp; They opened it up to the public temporarily because of the November 15th deadline.&nbsp; Hope it helps!

				Thank you so much aquaecny, but I need someone to help me get the 2007 gap provisions. www.medicarerights.org (http://www.medicarerights.org) only has the 2006 plans. And, unfortunately, just like www.medicare.gov (http://www.medicare.gov) the site is not Macintosh friendly. <br /><br />Would your roommate know if anyone is covering the Donut Hole with anything except generics? That information would be an enormous help to me. <br /><br />I am currently with Humana. I have no loyalty to any carrier at this point. They are planning on changing their monthly rate from $47.93 to $87.10, and not covering branded items during the hole anymore.<br /><br />I have even spoken to Medicare. I called 3 times and got 3 different answers. <br /><br />This is such an effing nightmare. This miserable Part D was supposed to help people obtain their life saving/enhancing medications. Instead it leaves those who need coverage drowning in their damn HOLE and makes the carriers richer!

				MRC also has a hotline that you can call.... but since they lost their funding from the federal governement, I&#39;m not sure how up to date and trained their volunteers are<br /><br />however, I have it direct from the HIICAAP coordinator that their volunteers are up to date in training, so maybe they will know the answer to your question (it&#39;s my experience as a social worker that HIICAP had better info than CMS hotline workers because CMS - Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services - is a big confusing bureaucracy)...<br /><br />here is their information:<br /><br />The NYC HIICAP is New York&#39;s source for free, current and impartial information about health care coverage.

Would you be kind enough to tell your HICAPP coordinator that they are *not* up-to-date! They know nothing about the 2007 (Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage) Part D provisions. No-one needs the 2006 information anymore. The period is over in less than a week. We need the next phase information. I already knew *more* than the person with whom I spoke. And worse than that, I need very specific information at that. I just need the answer to the donut hole coverage question for 2007.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=4047.msg40331.html#msg40331">Quote from: NYCMacUser on November 07, 2006, 03:29:16 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">. . .

				I *just* got off the phone with Medicare. Two and a half hours +, and what did I resolve? Very, very little. I still can&#39;t get the information I need to make an informed choice on a new Part D carrier. If I had placed this post in the rants section, I would really carry on right now. Our new Congress *needs* to be put on notice that this thing isn&#39;t working. They *need* to revise it in the next session or more and more older folks will be throwing up their hands in disgust and frustration, and stopping taking their medications because they simply can&#39;t make the choice between food and rent and their medications.<br /><br />I am going to try to sleep. I&#39;ll (re)start my quest for information again tomorrow. <br /><br />If your parents are in the same spot I am in, please help them figure it out. It is far too complicated to do alone.&nbsp; :cry:
