			It&#039;s not a strange name, it is just a little old fashioned. I think it sounds hipsterish, personally (I think because I&#039;ve seen it used in places like DUMBO and the like). We&#039;ve known it was going to be a pharmacy for some time - it was reported around the time Fatty&#039;s announced their move. I peeked in the other day and it looked like they still had to put up shelves and things. And yes, the son of the owner is a pharmacist and he wanted to open up his own place.

			I agree, Braun, terrible location.&nbsp; Good luck to the hipsters.<br /><br /><br />--- Quote from: braun on November 06, 2014, 02:29:56 PM ---It&#039;s going to be a pharmacy.&nbsp; What a waste of space for that location!&nbsp; I live right over there.&nbsp; Let&#039;s see how many people go there when they could walk up to the CVS on 31st St.&nbsp; Even though I will only have to walk half a block to get there I will not use this pharmacy. I&#039;m sorry that Fatty&#039;s had to move because of this.<br /><br />--- End quote ---<br />

			I like to eat out or have a drink at times, but it&#039;s nice nice that a business other than a bar, pizzeria, bagel shop, or cafe is opening. Perhaps it will be one of those pharmacies that serves egg creams. Who knows.

			you never know... there&#039;s Farmacy in Brooklyn and then there&#039;s<br /><br /><br />http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/hamill-new-greenwich-village-eatery-fountain-youth-article-1.1947097<br /><br />or<br /><br /><br />http://fairoakspharmacy.net/aboutus/index.html<br /><br /><br /><br />but I could be off the mark.
