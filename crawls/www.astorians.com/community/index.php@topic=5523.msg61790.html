But intelligent design loses to evolution because many more scientists are convinced by evolutionary arguments than they are by the non-existent scientific basis of intelligent design. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I respectfully disagree, Melee. Concerning the validity of a claim, consensus is irrelevant.<br /><br />&quot;Intelligent Design loses to evolution&quot; because there is a fact-based reality and those of us who choose to focus on and respect facts must come to this conlcusion. Evolution is a good theory regardless of how many people see it as such.<br /><br />Anthropogenic catastrophic global warming theory, on the other hand, does not enjoy nearly as exalted a status as evolution. Because it hasn&#039;t earned that status. <br /><br />The challenge before advocates of this theory is to demonstrate that in addition to those climate changes which would happen naturally, human activity influences the climate to such an extent (primarily by our carbon emissions and deforestation) that a climate crisis will result that would not otherwise occur. Therefore, humans must change their behavior in ways that can be (have been) calculated to avert otherwise inevitable climate-based disasters.<br /><br />This theory is not evidence-based. It is, in fact, a model-driven forecast. There are certainly correlations between anthropogenic carbon emissions and global warming, but the extent of causality is a subject of significant dispute among respected scientists. Reading the Wikipedia entry on global warming is instructive. There are many competing theories, many variables that merit further study. A reasonable human being can look at this issue and surmise that it is significantly unsettled. The proposition that human beings are producing global warming that will result in a &quot;climate crisis&quot; is an assertion, not a verified scientific theory. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=5523.msg61646.html#msg61646">Quote from: Melee on March 13, 2007, 02:14:04 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> Same deal here.

I can choose a fact-based reality, somehow manage neither to demonize nor disregard the impact of industrial/governmental pollution, and consider that public policies set by governments may not be the best way to address social and environmental problems. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=5523.msg61646.html#msg61646">Quote from: Melee on March 13, 2007, 02:14:04 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> Of course, global climate change is a historical reality. Its nonsensical to say &#039;I believe the climate changes&#039;. We can show that. Are you instead trying to say &#039;I believe there is warming?&#039;. The factors of influence you list are a very few of the major complicating influences actually at work in any sophisticated model of change. This isn&#039;t easy to model - it just isn&#039;t, and its not going to be. There are too many feedback cycles, both positive (ie: increase warming) and negative, and a bunch of unknowns. <br /><br />But we have been crunching what data we have through supercomputers for nearly 50 years now. The models are getting better and better. For example, the 1980s model by Hansen et al. accurately predicted a significant amount of change over the past 20 something years - including accounting for major volcanic eruptions (1). </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />As complex as they are, there are no models in existence that account for the complexity of the actual climate. And, for the record, models are not a basis for data. Anyone who has played SimCity knows this. Models are, themselves, only as good as the data we put into them, which data are significantly determinative of their output. &quot;Because a model* said so...&quot; is not a basis for a scientific conclusion.<br /><br />*Unless the model is, you know, really cute and persuasive.&nbsp; :lol:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=5523.msg61646.html#msg61646">Quote from: Melee on March 13, 2007, 02:14:04 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> <br />I&#039;m not sure what &#039;conclusive&#039; science you would like to show you that warming might be a net negative for human beings.&nbsp; </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well, the Earth warmed throughout the 20th century. During that time, most human problems were a direct and indirect result of violent governments. Exceptional loss of life due to statist regimes aside, it was a century that saw per capita improvements on virtually every major category: longevity, health, productivity, and wealth increased measurably all over the world. <br /><br />Even though the Earth warmed by approximately 0.6 degrees Celsius, people at the end of the century were living longer, healthier lives with more leisure time and more real income than their counterparts 100 years prior. <br />&nbsp; <br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=5523.msg61646.html#msg61646">Quote from: Melee on March 13, 2007, 02:14:04 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> <br />As temperatures rise, sea levels might also rise. Okay, maybe that&#039;s not a big deal - sea level rises are hard to predict accurately, and are very long term. But here&#039;s a taste of some of the rest of it. Water: rainfall patterns are shifting, in some areas quite dramatically (talk to Australia sometime). This means areas that have been the &#039;breadbaskets&#039; of the world are no longer necessarily going to be able to rely on rainfall to grow crops. Drinking water resevoirs are in places that also can predict their rainfall - when that stops, drinking water supplies to major metropolitan areas decline. Weeds and Disease: These are together because they&#039;re much the same - shifting climates mean expansions of species such as poison ivy, ragweed, mosquitos. More serious agricultural pests as well. Mosquitos are already on the move in many places, warming allows them to expand upwards, for instance. If you&#039;ve ever been in a malarial area, you&#039;ll know the cities and towns are often in the hills, away from the mosquitos - no more. West Nile and NYC anyone? And for the rest, well - some understanding of ecology would probably help. Humans are actually still part of the environment, no matter how urban and electronic your life might be. Changes to the flora and fauna outside of our cities will affect us as well.&nbsp; &nbsp;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No amount of reducing anthropogenic carbon emissions is going to relieve us from responsibility for adapting to a climate that, as a brute fact of reality, is going to change continually in ways that will require us to adapt. Shall we look to government or entrepreneurs for inspiration?<br /><br />One question worth considering is: should humans attempt to slow global warming by reducing their emissions *without any guarantee that doing so will produce desirable results*? Here&#039;s another question: Do we really believe that humans can set and maintain a temperature range on this planet that will be optimal for human civilization to thrive? Another question we might consider is this: In what ways can and should human beings maximize their adaptability to climate change... to change in general? <br /><br />On a separate note, with all due respect, in light of the problems facing humanity today and our scarce resources, we have to prioritize. People are suffering and dying all over the world because men with guns are forcing them to lead lives without access to food, capital, the rule of law, private property, economic opportunities... and we&#039;re talking about the poison ivy, mosquitoes, rainfall patterns in decades to come.... here&#039;s where I&#039;m coming from. <br /><br />Where people are starving today, they should be able to buy Perrier, prosciutto, and pumpernickel, but they can&#039;t. Why? No protection of individual liberty. No opportunities to create wealth. No electricity or running water. Having seen these situations with my own eyes, I can tell you, global warming is an overweighted priority in the developed world because only there do they have the luxury of contemplating the future inconveniences of changing weather patterns and warmer temperatures.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=5523.msg61646.html#msg61646">Quote from: Melee on March 13, 2007, 02:14:04 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> <br />And then there&#039;s the ethical arguments - is it okay for us to drive even more of the world&#039;s species to extinction? </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The absence of private property is, in fact, a primary enabler of pollution (the commons is abused because there is no proprietor who cares about ensuring that it is protected... just look at Steinway Street, and then look at your apartment).

We can even measure about how much CO2 has been around at various times, including post-industrial revolution vs. geological history. And guess what? every time there&#039;s a ton of it around, the earth gets warmer. That&#039;s simple enough for everyone to understand.&nbsp; </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It makes sense that all other factors being equal, more CO2 in the atmosphere results in a warmer average global temperature.

Change technologies - we do it all the time. Government incentives rather than regulation, if you&#039;re really that concerned about it (and America always seems to be - but the rest of the world gets along just fine without this attitude). We could actually end up growing the economy quite significantly! let&#039;s have some foward thinking and innovation! isnt that what this country is supposed to be great for? let&#039;s go!! </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />More CO2 makes the Earth warmer. Humans are responsible for approximately ... actually, how much of all the CO2 in our atmosphere are we responsible for? Why is it so hard to track down numbers on this stuff?

We&#039;re doing this science. We&#039;ve been doing it for 30 years. Just because now is the moment that its good enough to take to the politicians and say okay, now ACT doesn&#039;t mean that we haven&#039;t fricking thought about this. To turn around and say &#039;oh but its not good enough because you didn&#039;t predict that on Jan 12, 2007 the temperature would be 35 degrees&#039; is the most insane s___ I&#039;ve heard in a while (and I routinely deal with creationists).</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m not asking that you predict the weather on a specific day, but if your model predicts a global average temperature change in exact degree ranges over the course of a century, you should be able to describe the phenomenon in terms that make sense between now and then. In other words, we have a temperature snapshot of the starting year and your model predicts a temperature snapshot of the final year (2100). What can we reasonably expect to happen in between? The temperature will climb, then fall, then climb, then fall.... and presumably during all of this time your model is accounting for solar radiation, clouds, volcanos, water vapor, anthropogenic emissions, and human innovation, too, right? Because we&#039;re not going to be doing in 50 years what we&#039;re doing now. The invention of X, the widespread adoption of the Y technique.... how is human innovation accounted for? Discovery? Social change? Or would you propose measures to render the human component of your predictive model as static as possible... and what would that come at the expense of?<br /><br />And then at the end, the average temperature increase for the century will be... you are fricking kidding me, right? Yours is not a faith-based reality?&nbsp; <br /><br />You&#039;re proposing that we spend how many trillions in the hope of making your future come true?

Scientists, priests, politicians, strippers, you, me.... we all respond to incentives.&nbsp; On an individual basis, some of us are certainly more decent and respectful than others, some of us care more about not endorsing public policies based on coercion than others, some of us might conform a finding to the expectations of a grantor, others might focus on some data and not others because they want to put food on on the table. See public choice theory.<br /><br />Scientists conduct double blind clinical studies of drugs to avoid confirmation bias.

You may find this analogy to be overly severe, but I would liken that to piling a bunch of people onto a rescue boat until the whole thing sinks, which helps no one. Various other analogies would fit, like something about having to build stronger supports for taller buildings or needing a really sturdy table if you&#039;re going to put some really heavy stuff on it. The argument here is for sustainability.<br /><br />However, certainly there&#039;s enough money being wasted by our government today that a sizable investment in environmental protection wouldn&#039;t have to starve all other causes. We&#039;ve already spent close to a trillion dollars, if not more, in Iraq and we still don&#039;t seem short of money to waste. Though I guess that depends on how you view the national debt. Man, our government sucks.</div>

You may find this analogy to be overly severe, but I would liken that to piling a bunch of people onto a rescue boat until the whole thing sinks, which helps no one. <br />Various other analogies would fit, like something about having to build stronger supports for taller buildings or needing a really sturdy table if you&#039;re going to put some really heavy stuff on it.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />&nbsp;&quot;...developing things to help preserve the environment....&quot; <br /><br />Your premise is that if human beings don&#039;t specifically focus on reducing carbon emissions, the emissions amounts will reach a point at which the Earth will become, essentially, uninhabitable. <br /><br />What if your premise is wrong? In the way, for example, that a resident of NYC in 1900 would be wrong to predict that the city would be impossible to live in 50 years into the future because of the piles of horseshit all over the place. They didn&#039;t anticipate disruptive technology shift called the automobile and the assembly line. In the way, for example, that people are wrong when they make any fine predictions about the future based on a frame of reference that cannot adequately account for the unpredictable, spontaneous nature of human beings. Or in the way that giving the government control over our adaptability to climate change may just completely backfire?<br /><br />Would you have predicted the end of the Soviet Union, how and when it occured? The personal computer, more specifically the GUI of the Mac? Wireless phones making international calls? Health food stores? <br /><br />Sustainability is unpredictable because we are. What we think is impossible today may be common tomorrow. What sustained humanity once upon a time would be insufficient today... you get the idea.<br /><br />I was born in the seventies when many prospective parents, including friends of my parents, were admonished by the scientific establishment about inevitable overpopulation that would result in hundreds of millions, even billions of people dying of starvation, not in some distant future, but in the 1980s and 1990s. The thing is, not only was the overpopulation mantra wrong, it was profoundly wrong. Not only was population growth not linear in wealthy nations, as had been projected, but innovators like Norman Borlaug made it possible for billions of people to avoid malnutrition and thrive. Yet people really believed in overpopulation. <br /><br />This idea that people living in the developing world will end up with all of the benefits of modern life that we currently enjoy, but it will be all for naught because of the impact of anthropogenic carbon emissions is not descriptive, is not scientifically derived, it&#039;s based on models. Models that can&#039;t account for social change, new technologies, etc. <br /><br />Human beings throughout recorded history have had to adapt to changing conditions. It&#039;s what we do. Especially insofar as it has been used to argue, as many have, that the developing world should not be allowed access to economic development opportunities, this is a pernicious idea: one implicit assertion is that the risk of economic prosperity and enhanced longevity is that it will overburden the Earth. I&#039;m not saying that&#039;s yours or anyone on this board&#039;s assertion, but I have heard this set forth as a rationale for slowing economic development and I find it deplorably inhumane.<br /><br />Humanity&#039;s best chance for enhanced longevity and prosperity on this planet comes from our ingenuity. What drives ingenuity is a process of adaptation in the face of challenges and a process of dynamic discovery based on trial and error, profits and losses, experimentation. <br /><br />If there was ever the possibility of a man-made black hole for human life, liberty and wealth, it would be a government program tasked with controlling the Earth&#039;s climate. Would there ever be a big enough budget, enough interventionist power for such an endeavor? <br />&nbsp;<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=5523.msg61769.html#msg61769">Quote from: essen on March 14, 2007, 02:23:41 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The argument here is for sustainability.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Sustainability... who would argue against that? Not me. <br /><br />What happens when a scarce resource is declared a commons? Like Chilean Sea Bass? Like medical professionals? Like forests? They get used up to extinction because nobody has a vested interest in preserving the resource. In fact, the self-interest of a person with access to a resource he/she knows everybody else has access to is to take as much of it as possible, more than he or she needs, because (1) he/she knows everybody else will do the same thing and (2) because waste has no cost. In economics, this is known as the tragedy of the commons. On the other hand, ownership incentivizes stewardship, which is sustainability-plus. People take care of what they own and crap all over what nobody owns.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sustainability has to be profit driven. Has nothing to do with taking a LEFT or RIGHT stand on the issue. Why do lumber companies plant trees? Because they want to ensure future revenue. Why do the fishermen in Iceland not have the fish shortages suffered in Chile? Because each of them privately owns the right to fish between specific coordinates, so they do so in a manner that doesn&#039;t destroy their ability to make profits over time.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;d love to see an end to sweetheart deals between businesses and governments whereby companies relocate to a state that promises eminent domain taking of the company&#039;s preferred destination, extraordinary tax-deferments and pollution without consequences. I see privatization of&nbsp; property as a check on pollution without consequences, at the very least. Private property owners tend to be less tolerant of pollution than are governments. Ideally, I&#039;d like a separation of economy and state whereby it is a criminal act for politicians and/or individuals/businesses to seek advantages and/or wealth (corporate welfare, loopholes, etc.)&nbsp; ... but that&#039;s probably best saved for another thread.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=5523.msg61769.html#msg61769">Quote from: essen on March 14, 2007, 02:23:41 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">However, certainly there&#039;s enough money being wasted by our government today that a sizable investment in environmental protection wouldn&#039;t have to starve all other causes.

Man, our government sucks.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes, our government does suck. Except for most of the rest, which don&#039;t have the U.S.&#039;s robust initial defense of individual liberty. But yeah, it&#039;s pretty rough right now. The war.... takes my breath away. And now the pendulum is swinging hard towards a new kind of centrist national socialism, supported jointly by Democrats and Republicans, in which the winners are politicians, bureaucrats, big businesses, big special interest groups, and the losers are individual citizens making less than $100,000, small businesses, and entrepreneurs. The primary effect of &quot;a sizable investment in environmental protection&quot; by our government will enrich and empower the aforementioned winners at the expense of the aforementioned losers.<br /><br />Trusting government to do anything consistently and efficiently and smartly and morally is absofuckinglutely insane. </div>

If that were the case, don&#039;t you think we have a moral obligation to NOT triple CO2 levels? If you don&#039;t agree, I hereby declare you an evil person.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So I&#039;m either with you or against you?&nbsp; :-(&nbsp; Would being &quot;declared&quot; evil get me a discount on an Axis of Evil membership?<br /><br />Plan A: Keep anthropogenic carbon emissions at current levels or reduce them to avoid a future in which MAYBE &quot;tens of trillions of dollars in economic impacts and kill a billion people through civil war, famine, and disease.&quot; And, then again, it&#039;s possible none of that would have happened. <br /><br />Is &quot;Plan A&quot; free? No. Of course, it isn&#039;t. Are there real flesh and blood people with dire needs today? I&#039;ve talked about them in previous posts. We all know there are people suffering all over the world. The Venezualans have a pretty bleak future (a friend of mine studying in Boston has his family telling him not to come back, and they&#039;re trying to get out!). Chavez has the fossil fuels flowing overtime. You think he&#039;ll agree to be bound by your plan? Putin? What would drastically reducing trade with Middle-Eastern regimes like Saudi Arabia lead to?&nbsp; <br /><br />Are you, Harlan, going to actually prevent people in India and Africa and China from burning fossil fuels to meet their growing needs? How is this global initiative going to work? What will be the consequences for countries that refuse to reduce their emissions? Will they be labeled evil and invaded? Will there be wars of necessity in the hopes of averting wars? Might that lead to famine? Disease? I know envirofanatics have prevented dams from coming online in India, consigning hundreds of thousands of people to burning dung in huts for heat and to cook, denying millions access to electricity. Is human misery the cost of saving the world? <br /><br />You&#039;re sure you have the moral high ground in this discussion, or are you only 50% sure? Because the way I see it, it is a moral priority not to accept moral priorities that sacrifice some people to benefit others...... and especially others who aren&#039;t even born yet.<br /><br />What exactly are you proposing, Harlan, in order that the planet Earth&#039;s atmosphere *might* have a certain composition and average temperature?</div>

Spend time at home with your family and friends or go walking, see how creative you can be, plant a tree, but use no or as little energy as possible.<br /><br />Turn off the TV, turn off the Internet, turn off the phone.&#039;<br /><br /><br /><br />&#039;Climate change and global warming is not something that is going to happen, it has started, it is happening right now.<br /><br />1day is our day to celebrate our home, to pay thanks to it. Every year in every country on Earth, we have hundreds of different holidays to remember and celebrate things of the past. 1day is a day to celebrate the future. It is a day that we give to today&#039;s children.<br /><br />1day is a message to governments that we support their recent positive actions on climate change and we need more of them.<br /><br />1day is a choice, not a protest.<br /><br />PLEASE PARTICIPATE IN 1day!
