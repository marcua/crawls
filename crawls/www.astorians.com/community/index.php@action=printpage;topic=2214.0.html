				I hate these people. he sounded so calm and nice but you know he is evil, pure evil.&nbsp; talk calmly and say evil things, that always works best.<br /><br />what happened to being happy with a country that tolerates all?&nbsp; why must he have a country where his way is the only way????&nbsp;&nbsp; And this is a good christian?&nbsp; <br /><br />ARGGGHHHHH!!!!!!!!&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Did you catch the part about &quot; so dont you tell your female students that they will have to obey their husbands in life?&quot;&nbsp; &quot;oh no&quot; he says &quot; we dont teach that, it just comes up every now and again in church or meetings&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;
