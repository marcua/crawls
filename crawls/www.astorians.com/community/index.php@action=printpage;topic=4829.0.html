				My boss is an egotistical, condescending, patronizing poopyhead. I&#39;ve only been there 2 and a half months and I want to quit already. I like the work that I do but I can&#39;t stand the way he talks to me. He&#39;s constantly micromanaging me and talking to me as if I were a servant and expecting me to genuflect to his &quot;genius&quot;. Moreover, he doesn&#39;t understand how things are done, so I&#39;m forced to either try and make him see that he&#39;s wrong or do something that I know is inefficient and won&#39;t work. Plus, this isn&#39;t exactly what I thought I would be doing when I graduated from college (I graduated in May). I would look for another job but I haven&#39;t been there that long and it would look bad if I went from job to job....are there any people out there who have been through or are going through the same thing that can let me know I&#39;m not alone? I&#39;m ready to eat my own face.

				Remain the professional that you are, explain to him the consequences of doing it HIS way, and then proceed accordingly. Remember, you&#39;re just out of school and he&#39;s the boss.<br /><br />Besides, you&#39;ve got your entire future. Another job might mean another jerk for a boss- there are SO many. Don&#39;t take it personally, and pity the guy for being the way he is.<br /><br />We&#39;ve all been/are there. More power to ya.&nbsp; :wink:

				I&#39;m of the mind if you&#39;re unhappy and the job isn&#39;t right for you, then keep your eyes open for other possibilities and move on when the job and time are right for you.&nbsp; Happiness in my job is very important to me and a job that stresses me out everyday and where I&#39;m treated horribly would probably not be worth it for me.&nbsp; But it does depend on the job and what you are getting out of being in that position.&nbsp; If you can get the same experience elsewhere and be happier, I would move on.&nbsp; &nbsp;Stick it out for now, but keep your eyes and ears open.&nbsp; When you see a better position, pounce on it.&nbsp; It may be the best decision you ever made (at least it was for me).

				sometimes you have to draw a picture:<br /><br />option 1: <br />pros<br /><br />cons<br /><br />option 2: <br />pros<br /><br />cons<br />&nbsp;<br />etc. and schedule a meeting to talk about it. of course sometimes it&#39;s not worth the battle. but sometimes people who will brush you off when you try to explain something complicated will act a bit better when they have something to read.

				No matter where you are there will always be crap to deal with. If it isn&#39;t a boss it will be a co-worker. If not a co-worker then a client. If not a client then a project manager or consultant. I think it is difficult to really know if your boss or work environment will be a good one until you are in it. I loved the people in my last job, but they didn&#39;t handle stress very well (lots of yelling, crying, swearing) - mostly great to hang out with but not entirely great to work with. I really like my current job because I have an excellent boss who doesn&#39;t belittle me or the rest of us on our team - but there are a lot of people that are more difficult to deal with and I just have to learn how to handle it and thank the gods that they aren&#39;t my boss.<br /><br />Since this is your direct boss I would agree that you should keep your eyes open. What about the company? Do you like it? If you like the company is there a way for you to stay, but move to a different department? If you can financially swing it maybe try an internship or temp until you find an environment that works for you. Companies like to hire interns and temps because that means that they are hiring someone they&#39;ve already trained in and know.<br /><br />Make sure that when you interview that you always ask how the work environment is and if people get along. After all - this is not just your interview, you are interviewing them as well. They may not always answer honestly, but it&#39;s good to ask anyway. I&#39;ve noticed that it is a question that can take some people off-guard as they are not always expecting it. If you want to make sure someone is a good boss, just ask them, &quot;How do you think you are as a boss?&quot;<br /><br />Good luck and I hope that you can figure out a good solution soon!
