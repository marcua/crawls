				Hi, Has anyone ever heard of 2 or more people partnering to buy a building? <br /><br />Wish I could buy and live in a prewar 2 bedroom in a small (6 family max.) building south of 30th Ave instead of paying rent...<br />

				i&#039;m not a real estate expert but sounds like either a condo or co-op arrangement. i&#039;ve heard of people forming a co-op when their apartment building went up for sale so they could stay in the same place.<br /><br />related but off-topic: has anyone heard of several people buying a car? as a group you would pay for the vehicle, maintenance and insurance. perhaps this is an impossible dream.

What would happen if one person didn&#039;t pay? Or if the person on the title decided to just up and move? How do you legally put a car and its payments and insurance under several people&#039;s names? For that matter, what would insurance be like?

				I think you have to form a LLC, a Limited Liability Corporation, to buy a property between several individuals.<br /><br />I&#039;ve thought about this a lot since where I live it&#039;d be impossible to buy a multi-family unit by myself.&nbsp; I actually had an opportunity to get a 6 family in the Hunters Point section of Long Island City this past fall, but 2 of the apartments needed to be re-done.&nbsp; So besides the initial cost of the actual building it self, I&#039;d need money for those 2 apartments.&nbsp; The building itself though was owned by the same family for 3 generations and was kept in tip top shape, except for those apts. that needed work.<br /><br />By myself, impossible, but with one or 2 or more people it would&#039;ve been relatively easy.&nbsp; But my friends are broke and doing something like that with a stranger was too much of a risk.<br /><br />You always hear about people doing it years ago in places like the Village/Tribeca and now the parties that did it are all rich.&nbsp; A lot of work, but worth it in the end, IMHO.&nbsp;

				Thanks masande and paratactical.<br /><br />With a car co-op, can you imagine the fights for holiday weekends!&nbsp; Maybe a ballot system, but then it&#039;s probably easier just to rent a car.<br /><br />Kyle, very interesting - if you don&#039;t mind me asking how much was the Hunters Point building going for? That would have been awesome.<br /><br />I was considering buying in the next year or so, depending on the economy and property prices. There are not a lot of options around $500K (not interested in new condos or huge co-op buildings). Instead of buying a single family for 550K, it would be great to go 1/2 in a $750K 2 family, or 1/6 in a $900K 4 or 6 family in a prime Astoria/LIC location and split closing costs, taxes, renovation, building maintenance expenses etc... I think with the right people and legal contract it could be a very good alternative.<br /><br />

				Asking 1.5m, heard they accepted 1.25m.&nbsp; Fixed up, the building would easily be worth close to 3 million.&nbsp; 2 blocks from the new LIC waterfront park, 2 blocks from the Vernon-Jackson #7 subway stop, one stop from the city...and a full basement that could be another apartment with the proper permits.&nbsp; And a nice and quiet backyard!&nbsp; <br /><br />It kills me thinking about it now! :cry:&nbsp; The one that got away...

				Kyle, 1.25M still kills me - sounds like a great building in a great location though. The market in Queens is definitely slowing - I am beginning to see more price reductions in LIC.&nbsp; If you hear of anything, maybe we should get together and have a serious chat.

				Well, a lot of the 2 and 3 bedrooms condos here in Hunters Point are in the 1+ range, so for a 6 family, it was a steal.&nbsp; Except for the fix-up costs.&nbsp; I also have no experience with hiring contractors/renovating, so that&#039;d be a barrier for me personally.<br /><br />There&#039;s one for sale right by the entrance to the Midtown Tunnel, but again, it needs a ton of work and it&#039;s only a 4 family.&nbsp; I think they&#039;re asking 995k.

				I know the one - it has been on the market for 6 months or so, stared at $1.10M and has now dropped to $950K. The location is not great and it has one rent controlled apt.&nbsp; I think it will have to drop a lot more before it sells.<br /><br />There are a few others that have been on the market for a while on zillow.com with no takers.

				True. And if at any time after the building fell under rent stabilization guidelines (pre-1974), some of the units were combined and go under 6 units (say from a 6 unit to a 4 unit building), the building is still regarded as rent stabilized.

				Is anyone still considering doing this...purchasing a 2+ family house in Astoria?&nbsp; My husband and I have been looking to buy here, but it is all so expensive.&nbsp; We may be interested in meeting if any of you plan to meet.<br />I think it is a great idea.&nbsp; I think it is better with strangers/business partners than friends.&nbsp; This way the expectations are clear from the beginning.

				If you wanted to buy say a 6 family building, split it 6 ways and wanted to live in it, wouldn&#039;t the other 5 want to live in it also? If there were only a couple of vacant units which of the 6 would have &quot;dibs&quot; on it? If you all moved in, you wouldn&#039;t wind up making any money since your money has to go to the mortgage rather than a tennants money. <br />Things like that make me think if you&#039;re buying it shouldn&#039;t be with so many people. Just a thought. Too many cooks and all that...

				I see your point.<br />I was thinking of it as a place to live and not only an investment.&nbsp; So, I would be paying a mortgage as I would on a co-op, except I get to choose who I live with and it may open up the opportunity to live in an area that I choose, b/c it is sometimes easier in astoria to find a 2+ family house than a co-op.<br />I was figuring that instead of paying rent and someone else&#039;s mortgage I could pay my own!&nbsp;
