				Java,<br /><br />It is a little buck, holds one bottle, a little stand (meant for a table) and holds four glasses that hange from it. It is silver plated and is tarnished, so it needs a once over with a rag. I&#039;ll try and get a pic up now.

				What number is on the top tube? Trek always has a number, like 7100, 4500, 850 etc.<br /><br />I&#039;m guessing it has a front suspension fork and thick, knobby tires. If you&#039;re not sure of the size but you&#039;re comfortable on it, then we could guess the size based on your height.<br /><br />I have a Trek 4900 and absolutely love it, just as much as my fancy-schmancy expensive bike. You should be able to get nearly as much as you paid for it, great brand, durable on the city streets as well as the trails.

				Okay, Since I don&#039;t really know what I was looking for, so I went and copied any writing that I good. <br /><br />Men&#039;s bike, (but I&#039;m comfortable riding it)<br />Trek - 3700<br /><br />Shimano V-Brake<br /><br />RST (on front shock)<br /><br />Alpha custom aluminum<br /><br />Matrix 550 written on frame of tire<br /><br />Bontrager Connection Trail B 26x2.0 written on tire. <br /><br />Like I said it has been ridden about 5-6 times. I rode it a couple of times to central park when a friend used mine. I love mine and am keeping it, but my husband swore he is never going to ride one again. <br /><br />We paid 300 for it, but I will obviously come down as it is not new. .
