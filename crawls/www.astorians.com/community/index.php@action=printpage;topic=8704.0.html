				Hi there,<br />I&#039;m looking at an apartment tomorrow on 29th St and 21st Ave.&nbsp; I looked it up on Google and it says it&#039;s right across from the ConEd Power Plant. Does anybody live near this area and can tell me a little bit about it? It seems a little freaky to me living next to a giant power plant b/c i get visions of like barbed wire gates and glowing towers and humming noises.<br /><br />Can anybody reflect on this?<br /><br />Also, I&#039;m looking for a 1 bedroom or studio in Astoria or LIC, if you know of anything feel free to PM me. I have a job and good credit (yay!).<br /><br />Thanks (:<br />

				Hi<br /><br />Anyone have any feedback for the OP?&nbsp; I&#039;ve looked at a couple of apartments up in that neighborhood (21st Ave &amp; 21st St area), but I&#039;m wary of Big Alis.&nbsp; Any info would be appreciated!&nbsp; <br /><br />Paul

				To answer your question: Yes, there is barbed wire, gates, glowing towers (smokestacks) and humming noises. But that area is also a decent, safe place to live, close to the park and the subway.<br /><br />Your apartment will be on a residential side street, surrounded by other houses and/or apartment buildings up until 20 Avenue, which separates Con Ed from the residential area. <br /><br />It’s not a mixed-use neighborhood like it is around the Big Allis plant in LIC. One side of 20th Ave. is all residential, the other all Con Ed.<br /><br /><br />If it were me, my biggest concern would be noise but most people adjust after awhile.&nbsp; Some people would place pollution first but the whole neighborhood area is affected by that and it wouldn’t put me off from living there.<br /><br />Good luck with your search!<br />

				I have lived over by the Con Ed plant for a little over 2 years now.&nbsp; I live on a treelined street full of houses between 21ave and 20Ave.&nbsp; I don&#039;t hear any noise over here, and it is a huge difference from the load of noise I heard living right on Ditmars a few years ago.&nbsp; It&#039;s super quiet here on my street, most are families, and it&#039;s a really nice neighborhood.&nbsp; I don&#039;t notice Con Ed much unless I go and stare at it.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure I&#039;m affected by pollution but I do live in NYC so I&#039;m doomed anyway.&nbsp; There&#039;s lots of cute squirrels, birds, fireflys, trees and grass out this way, so it feels a bit more homey than living right on Ditmars did.

				I saw the post late and figured the OP had already made their visit.&nbsp; I lived in that area for a bit, on Shore Drive right between 20th and 21st Avenue.&nbsp; Did not notice the powerplant one bit, unless, just like Daisy said, I went over and stared at it.&nbsp; Nice neighborhood.&nbsp; Plus, though the powerplant is not a great thing to live next to, the amount of traffic is less over there, and traffic pollution is a bigger concern than power plant pollution, so I&#039;d figure it was a wash.&nbsp; There is a stinky smell that washes over from Ward&#039;s Island sewage treatment plant when the wind it right though, but it is bearable and infrequent.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />If you find a great place around there, don&#039;t let the existance of the powerplant or Ward&#039;s Island sway you away from snapping it up.&nbsp; Good luck if you haven&#039;t found a place yet!

The only nuclear power plant near here is Indian Point in Westchester.

				Actually, there are different types of radiation--in this case electromagnetic-field (EMF) radiation.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">A 2002 California Department of Health Services review of EMF risk studies concluded that &quot;EMFs can cause some degree of increased risk of childhood leukemia, adult brain cancer, Lou Gehrig&#039;s disease and miscarriages,&quot; but it did not single out power lines as the only source.<br /><br />&quot;No one&#039;s ever found what is either a safe or unsafe level for EMF,&quot; said PG&amp;E spokesman Paul Moreno. &quot;With overhead lines, they&#039;re up high. The EMF levels drop off very quickly as you move away from the source.&quot; </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />We looked at a place over there, and while it may be completely safe, I&#039;d probably worry myself into cancer (and then blame the EMFs).

				The strongest evidence linking EMF&#039;s to cancer was fabricated (http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/285/5424/23b).<br /><br />caroslime, what are you quoting from?&nbsp; I&#039;d like to see a link.&nbsp; Since you didn&#039;t provide one, I googled part of your quote.&nbsp; I came up with this summary of recent EMF health assessments (http://www.hydro.mb.ca/safety_and_education/emf/government.shtml) assembled by the government of Manitoba, with links.&nbsp; The studies for the most part agree with this one from the National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council (U.S.), 1997 (link to full study provided in summary):<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Based on a comprehensive evaluation of published studies relating to the effects of power-frequency electric and magnetic fields on cells, tissues, and organisms (including humans), the conclusion of the committee is that <strong>the current body of evidence does not show that exposure to these fields presents a human-health hazard</strong>.

				Thanks for posting that information.&nbsp; Very helpful.&nbsp; I was quoting an article about an Oakland, CA power plant closing over safety concerns: <br /><br />http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4176/is_20060518/ai_n16418342<br /><br />I&#039;m not trying to be alarmist, and I am certainly no scientist, I just wanted to say that there are different types of radiation, not just nuclear.&nbsp; And as I stated myself, it may be completely safe.&nbsp; I&#039;m just not interested in taking my chances.&nbsp; But that&#039;s just me...<br />

I&#039;m a scientist (although in a completely different field (haha)), and the thing about safety and power lines is that nobody can figure out why very low-frequency electromagnetic energy would have any effect on people at all. There&#039;s just not enough energy to mutate DNA, cause leukemia or whatever. There might be something else going on, chemical contamination or something, but there&#039;s just no obvious <em>mechanism</em> for power lines to be harmful. (Unless you touch them, of course.) It&#039;s certainly worth checking, of course, but the fact that there&#039;s little to no epidemiological evidence that any effect is real suggests that there&#039;s just no safety problem.<br /><br />Cell phones, on the other hand, are a different matter entirely. The frequencies are high enough and the distances are small enough that there could be real effects. It&#039;s fortunate that no strong correlations with brain cancer have been found, but there could have been...<br /><br /><br />Anyway, best of luck finding a nice place to live! And keep your windows shut, given all the soot around here!<br /><br />

				Just so no one is confused: the power plant with Big Allis is the Ravenswood Plant off 36th Avenue. The power plants located off 20th Avenue are not owned by Con - Edison, but Con Ed does own the property and the power distribution equipment. Also, almost all generating stations on the site burn either liquid fuel or natural gas depending on the economic conditions. And anyone concerned with EMF, you are subjecting yourself to far more of it reading this then if you were standing on the sidewalk outside the plant.
