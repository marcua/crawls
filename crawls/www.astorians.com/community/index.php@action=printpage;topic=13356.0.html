				Im not a female who had a baby , so nothing to be jealous abt . However&nbsp; i am in the business and i know how they bounce back so quick while other women have such a difficult time no matter how hard they workout and diet . A surgeons skilled hand beats any gym or diet&nbsp; and when u have the resources like they do , it isnt that difficult . Dont be fooled into thinking , she popped out a child and her stomach has no stretch marks and the skin has shrunk right back even though she carried ther baby for 9 months .

				Im not saying that this model had this or anything done , but in this industry and in hollywood ,90% of those in the public eye , especially women who had babies and want to appear in the nude or in bikinis and thongs&nbsp; get work done . Its pretty obvious cuz u cant make stretch marks become invisible nor can u make boobs which sag after breast feeding bounce right back into shape .&nbsp; Ofcourse they diet and work out , eat right and stay out of the sun&nbsp; but some things u just cant fix&nbsp; to appear flawless like they all do .
