I will confirm the opening date later and confirm to you all wheter or not to drop in on the 23rd right after our Giving thanks day.<br />Ciao a Tutti Belli.

				They are not doing any regions, they have a great chef who just loves to cook and supposedly the Guacamole will be done table side, the Fajitas nothing like your use to, and they will make their own mole, hopefully with this great Colombian Chocolate Cordillero, and well i guess when they open we will all know.

				OMG, this is great news.&nbsp; I was wondering what that place was going to be, and I have been wishing a good Mexican place would come over to our area.&nbsp; The taco truck is awesome, but this will be great for the nights when we want to have a sit-down meal.&nbsp; Killin.

				We went Saturday evening.&nbsp; Second night of business and staffed to the gills. They get lots of leeway here since they are so new.<br /><br />Nice bar area with comfortable seats.&nbsp; Nice table set up and good comfortable seating.&nbsp; Tables not crowded together. :mrgreen:<br />Soft lighting &amp; quiet background music.&nbsp; Unheard of and quite welcome here in Astoria. :mrgreen:<br />Friends joined us later at a table for drinks and we could actually hear each other without leaning in and screaming to each other.<br />One of the owners stopped by to say hello and talk about the place.&nbsp; Nice guy and our second round was on the house. <br />:mrgreen:<br />Excellent margarita for $6 served in a tall Pilsner glass.&nbsp; Strong on booze yet smooth going down. :mrgreen:<br /><br />Food was very fresh and clean.&nbsp; All obviously made on premises.<br />Very light on seasonings but hey, they just opened and we will most definitely go back for another meal.<br /><br />Prices were not cheap.&nbsp; Apps were around $8 to $12 and Entrees/meals were around $14 to $26.&nbsp; The apps we had could have been a bit more substantial for the price.&nbsp; Also the menu seemed a bit scattered.&nbsp; Looking forward to seeing how it gets refined over the coming months.<br /><br />Over all two thumbs up for decor, service, atmosphere &amp; drinks. We know the food will be perfected shortly because of all the good people working there to make your experience a memorable one.&nbsp; &nbsp;Welcome to the neighborhood.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Went Friday night with my roommate. We both ordered fajitas and they had to slide an extra table up for all the plates&nbsp; :-D<br /><br />The guacamole was supposed to be made tableside but wasn&#039;t, which was a little disappointing, and it came out with the food instead of as an appetizer. They comped a drink for us because of that, which was really nice. I feel like the food could be a touch more spicy, but that&#039;s normal for me. The steak fajitas were very, very good.

				That corner has been empty for so long, that I&#039;m really thrilled this has come in. (I was hoping for a bookstore, but that&#039;s another link, another dream....)<br />Anyhoo, I walked by the other day and its also very cozy looking. Can&#039;t wait to sit down and try this; sure it&#039;s got a few kinks as all new restaurants do, but at least it&#039;s not another cafe!!!! Yeah!!!!

				I have to make a correction&nbsp; &nbsp;:-o the cuisine is not just MEXICAN it is a latin cuisine restaurant&nbsp; :-D. The chef is Mexican but she has come up with other latin dishes. Gloria is Colombian and Hugo is Guatemalan so they are trying to cover the basic bases with the cuisine profile. :roll:.

				(We) ate here on Tuesday night before the mixer. Nothing particularly exotic, steak burritos with the homemade guac, but I thought it was very good. Margaritas were good as well. I wouldn&#039;t say it was particularly cheap, but with the menu and the ambiance it was clear to me that they are going after young professionals and the like. We&#039;ll definitely be going back again.

				For the last two years, we have waited for the corner of Steinway/28th ave to be filled. At long last, the corner has been filled by a resturant that Astorians can be proud of. <br /><br />Luna de Juarez is an experience bar none. My partner and I have been talking about this place since the moment it opened and tonight we finally made the plunge.<br /><br />We started with a pitcher of real Margaritas (no half stepping here). Then we got the Guacamole made at the table which was an experiance we had never enjoyed. They asked us what we wanted and blended everything there to our specifications. <br /><br />We ordered, for our main courses, the Steak fajitas and the Parrillada Luna ( a mixed grill plate including Steak, chicken, shrimp and chorizo). Both dishes were well cooked and tasteful. We had our own plates that allowed us to sample from all the mini plates and main dishes that they placed before us and we felt like every bite was full of individual flavors that encouraged us to enjoy more. <br /><br />However, what topped off the evening was the experience. Our waitress was new, but sweet and very attentive. And the owners came out to talk to us for quite a while, hopefully not something that will happen in the future because they will be too busy. they are very proud of what they have created here and I think Astoria will enjoy it.<br /><br />But more important will be this summer. When, during the hot months, we can stop by and have a pitcher of Margaritas and some guacamole in the outdoor seating area. Ahhhh....what a treat. <br /><br />Stop by....you won&#039;t be disappointed.

				Kempster, your single post and over the top praise make you a bit suspect.&nbsp; I do hope you are right on all counts because it means there have been improvements over at Luna.&nbsp; <br /><br />I agree that the atmosphere, music and lighting levels, margaritas and service may be the best in the immediate neighborhood and we are very grateful for that.&nbsp; <br /><br />BUT the food is just OK.&nbsp; We have been twice in two weeks for dinner.&nbsp; The guac both times was a small portion, pre made in the kitchen, ice cold and little to no salt, spice, acid.&nbsp; The same lack of seasonings went for the steak fajita and the Shrimp ceviche. Even the salsa with the chips is lacking salt and heat. The empanadas and tortilla soup on the other hand were absolutely wonderful.&nbsp; <br /><br />Here&#039;s hoping you are spot on correct.

				Just wanted to add to this discussion, as I went with a friend to this restaurant this past weekend.&nbsp; Great to see such a beautiful space on this corner.......a wonderful visual addition to the neighborhood!<br /><br />However, I was really disappointed by the food here........so much so that I felt embarassed to have brought my friend there after boasting about how great the restaurants are in Astoria!&nbsp; I&#039;m not gonna describe every last thing we ate, as I realize they&#039;re just starting up, and things will probably improve.&nbsp; However, I was really taken aback at how expensive things were on the menu.&nbsp; If I&#039;d looked at the menu before going in, I would have just kept on walking down to Ali&#039;s or Mombar........the prices are comparable, but I&#039;ve never been let down by the food at either restaurant.<br /><br />Due to a pretty empty bank account, I opted for one of the cheapest things on the menu (as far as mains are concerned) beef tacos ($13 or $14 I think?), and my friend got the steak fajitas ($16).&nbsp; my beef was really bland, so I tried my friend&#039;s fajitas, hoping all those peppers might have spiced things up a little.&nbsp; no such luck :-\<br /><br />I can say that the staff were very attentive, and the owner DID come over to ask how our meals were.........unfortunately I didn&#039;t have the guts to be honest, and mumbled a meek &quot;It&#039;s good, thanks.&quot;&nbsp; Hopefully they&#039;ll check out this board and try giving their patrons a little more bang for their buck.

				We went last night.&nbsp; We thought it was really terrific.&nbsp; Portions are huge and we over ordered.&nbsp; I&#039;d start by saying what an extremely friendly bunch of people they are.&nbsp; From the servers to what seemed to be an owner.&nbsp; They really aim to please.&nbsp; Though it could be that we were overwhelmed since we just suffered horrendous service at Mohave!&nbsp; Anyway, we both had the soup that is described as a cream soup with mushrooms, vegetables and cheese.&nbsp; It was pretty incredible.&nbsp; Very delicious.&nbsp; The bowl was about 14&quot; in diameter.&nbsp; Rather than just a soup that you eat in 2 minutes and forget - it was really a course to be enjoyed.&nbsp; With that I asked for the fried avocado appetizer.&nbsp; It&#039;s filled with shrimp and seafood.&nbsp; We thought this was absolutely delicious.&nbsp; It was rich without being too heavy.&nbsp; And very flavorful.&nbsp; The shrimp were perfect.&nbsp; Then we had two large entrees.&nbsp; One was the seafood stuffed chili rellenos and mine was the mixed meat burrito platter.&nbsp; They were both very good.&nbsp; My meat platter was gigantic.&nbsp; The churisso was amazing.&nbsp; The chicken was still moist and nicely char grilled.&nbsp; The steak, however, was cooked to death.&nbsp; The shrimp were amazing.&nbsp; Again, a huge table-filling plate.&nbsp; Soft, homemade, steaming tortillas on the side.&nbsp; That meal could feed three.&nbsp; The stuffed chili was delicious and also a very large portion.&nbsp; For sides we had a green salad.&nbsp; How good can a salad be?&nbsp; This one was cold and fresh and delicious.&nbsp; The refried beans were authentic (I&#039;m just not a huge fan) and the fried tostones were delicious (big plantain chips).&nbsp; The whole experience was a delight.&nbsp; The prices are not fast-food tex-mex.&nbsp; But that&#039;s a good thing.&nbsp; This is a moderately upscale venue with delicious food and incredibly friendly service.&nbsp; We will be back again and again.&nbsp; I&#039;d also add that the atmosphere is not overly ethnic.&nbsp; What I mean is that the football game was on and this place is a totally cool spot to drop in and have a beer, some empanadas, and watch a ball game.&nbsp; I say that because I think there&#039;s a real shortage in bars that look, act and feel &quot;normal&quot; in Astoria.&nbsp; They have happy hour until 8 every night.&nbsp; Another smart move in today&#039;s world when most people don&#039;t end work at 5 anymore.&nbsp;

				Tried this place a couple weeks ago.&nbsp; We ordered the shrimp fajitas and cheese enchiladas.&nbsp; For a Mexican restaurant, I was surprised with the lack of spices used, and I had a craving for hot sauce, which is not normal for me.&nbsp; They were out of all their frozen Margarita mix, but the bar looks nice and the place is decorated well.&nbsp; They had live music on Saturday night, which was really cool.&nbsp; I will probably go again, but I&#039;m just kind of surprised at how unspicy the food was.&nbsp; The menu did look good though, tons of stuff I want to try.&nbsp; I just hope I don&#039;t keep getting disappointed!&nbsp; &nbsp;:-(

				Ok, I really had high hopes for this place, especially since I live a block away, and I loved just sitting there and having a beer or a glass of wine back when it was Santorini.&nbsp; Its a great corner and the new owners have really spent a good deal of money renovating the place.&nbsp; It looks great.&nbsp; Also, the owners are great people.&nbsp; They make you feel like you are family, that being said, I&#039;ve now been there two times with my wife, and two times for drinks with friends.&nbsp; My verdict:&nbsp; Its a good place to have a drink, due to the nice owners and wait staff, but don&#039;t waste your money on the overpriced and underwhelming dishes.<br /><br />As you can tell, I really wanted them to succeed, I kept giving them another chance, hoping that the first time, and then the second time, was just a goof...but it wasn&#039;t.&nbsp; The food is bland.&nbsp; Not bad, just bland.&nbsp; But the food should be better given the prices.<br /><br />The first time I was there I had the steak fajitas.&nbsp; First off: the platter wasn&#039;t sizzling, the steak strips looked and tasted warmed over, and the peppers and onions were drenched in oil.&nbsp; Taste: bland.&nbsp; The second time I was there I had the lunch special pork chop and the &quot;pre-columbian soup&quot;.&nbsp; The soup was milky, and not creamy, and just bland and the pork chop was salty, not flavorful, just salty and small.<br /><br />Its a shame.&nbsp; Such a great corner, such a great decorating job, such nice people you just want them to succeed, but I cannot tell a lie.&nbsp; The food isn&#039;t worth it.&nbsp; This is definitely NOT authentic Mexican food.<br /><br />&nbsp;:cry:

				We went just last night for the second time.&nbsp; And brought friends.&nbsp; We all loved it and had a great time.&nbsp; This time we all enjoyed a large number of the Margaritas, which were excellent.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s a great meal for the price.&nbsp; The atmosphere is very nice.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never seen more varieties of artificial stone in one place in my life.&nbsp; But somehow it works here without looking ridiculous.&nbsp; The food may not be authentic Mexican.&nbsp; And it may not be of 5 star caliber.&nbsp; But that&#039;s not what they&#039;re trying to do.&nbsp; It&#039;s a casual local place.&nbsp; In my opinion the prices are just moderate.&nbsp; If not low for the quality and quantity of food.&nbsp; I think if you go in expecting a very good meal at a fair price, you&#039;ll love it.&nbsp; If you expect to be overwhelmed by gourmet cuisine and think you&#039;re going to have a very ethnic experience, then you&#039;ll be disappointed.&nbsp; We will be back again and again.&nbsp; The owners and staff also make it a very pleasant experience.&nbsp; The service can be a little off but it&#039;s more due to a slight language barrier and maybe an unfamiliarity with certain dining practices.&nbsp; But we found it more endearing than offensive.&nbsp; The bottom line is that they bend over backwards to please the customer.&nbsp; I hope they make it.

				I was there last week for the first time and I really enjoyed it. We really loved most everything we ate, although some things could have had a little more kick. The staff was welcoming and attentive and the atmosphere was warm and relaxing. <br /><br />Don&#039;t hate me... I enjoyed their food more than Mojave&#039;s.

				This place has excellent food and drinks!&nbsp; They make great margaritas and cocktails, and the food - both the standard Mex fare, as well as the more original dishes - are delicious.&nbsp; The decor and ambiance make you forget you are on Steinway, and the service is really good.&nbsp; I love Mexican food, and have been to every Mex restaurant in the area, and this has become my favorite.&nbsp; So glad I live just a block away!

				We finally got around to eating here tonight and both really enjoyed it.&nbsp; The Guacamole good, Luna Margaritas were excellent and the staff was very attentive.&nbsp; The burrito was really fresh tasting and the pollo de luna was incredible!<br /><br />Sadly, for a Saturday night there were only three other tables seated so who knows if it will be able to stick around long term.&nbsp; I certainly hope so though as I&#039;d love to explore more of the menu!

				My wife and I tried Luna de Juarez tonight based on so many recommendations that we&#039;ve gotten both from this board and from others.&nbsp; We walked in Friday night at 9:00PM.<br /><br />There were some redeeming qualities about it but overall, it plain old sucked.&nbsp; This is my third review that I&#039;ve posted now and I hate to be such a downer, but I simply can&#039;t endorse a restaurant that belongs on Ramsay&#039;s Kitchen Nightmares.&nbsp; It&#039;s that bad.<br /><br />So here we go from the beginning.<br /><br />From the moment we walked in, there was a live band.&nbsp; I immediately got excited until I realized that the band was awful.&nbsp; Really, it was one member of the band ruining the performance for all, namely, the trumpeter.&nbsp; He was horrible.&nbsp; Not only did he not realize that he couldn&#039;t play a note with any kind of purity and he couldn&#039;t sustain a note, but he tried to do solos all night and routinely tried to &quot;trump&quot; his band for volume.&nbsp; Everyone in the restaurant was squinting and wincing when he played.&nbsp; And boy did he play a lot.&nbsp; So the mood was bad.&nbsp; I&#039;m not blaming this on the restaurant per say, but it was BAD.<br /><br />Next, the service.&nbsp; They asked us if we wanted a drink.&nbsp; I said, &quot;Diet coke, please.&quot;&nbsp; My wife went with a water.&nbsp; After tasting my drink, I realized that I got a Jack and Coke instead.&nbsp; Because I didn&#039;t want to get charged for the alcohol, I told the waiter that I had ordered a Diet Coke but got an alcoholic Jack and Coke.&nbsp; He apologized and said he&#039;d be right back.&nbsp; Sure enough, he showed up 10 minutes later and brought me...what do you know...a Jack and Coke.&nbsp; I tasted it again and told him it wasn&#039;t right.&nbsp; I wanted a DIET COKE.&nbsp; He said he messed up and would be right back.&nbsp; He came back later with a JACK AND COKE again.&nbsp; So I thought it was fate that I&#039;d be drinking a Jack and Coke instead.&nbsp; And I did and ended up paying for it.<br /><br />Now onto the most important part: food.&nbsp; My wife ordered their &quot;famous&quot; steak fajitas and I ordered the beef enchiladas with verde sauce, rice and beans.&nbsp; The waiter told me that the verde sauce was a great choice for spicy food lovers, which I am, so I was excited.&nbsp; The order took 40 minutes to get to the table.&nbsp; Now ordinarily I wouldn&#039;t complain about 40 minutes for food, but we were one of only two tables that ordered food.&nbsp; It was kind of funny because based on body language both my table and the other table were wondering why the food was taking so long.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; When the food finally arrived, my wife looked horrified.&nbsp; Her steak fajitas ($17.95) were completely overcooked.&nbsp; The meat had shriveled along with the onions and peppers.&nbsp; They almost looked dehydrated if you could get past the fact that most of it was burned.&nbsp; Her side of pico de gallo was shriveled as well, most likely due to refrigerator burn.&nbsp; You could instantly tell it was probably made days ago with both the tomato and onions translucent and having no juices.&nbsp; On the other hand, my enchiladas ($13.95) were plump with cheese and verde sauce poured all over.&nbsp; The rice and beans looked &quot;out of the can,&quot; but it didn&#039;t matter because the enchiladas looked good.&nbsp; Until I ate them.&nbsp; The beef inside was completely dry to the bone, like jerky dry.&nbsp; Also, the sauce was as mild as milk, there was no spice in it whatsoever.&nbsp; I asked my wife to try mine to see if it was more edible than her burnt, dehydrated food.&nbsp; The sad part was that she wasn&#039;t sure which one she preferred more.&nbsp; I flagged the waiter down and asked for some hot sauce.&nbsp; He brought me tomato water.&nbsp; Again, no spice or taste whatsoever.&nbsp; The waiter later swung by and told me that he was going to bring me a side of sweet plantains.&nbsp; Oh great, I thought, a complimentary dish to win over customers.&nbsp; At least service was picking up points.&nbsp; As it turns out, the sweet plantains arrived after we were done eating.&nbsp; At least they were decent although lacked crispiness.&nbsp; I was willing to overlook that.&nbsp; Until I found out that he charged me for it.<br /><br />By the end, I paid $50 for quite possibly the worst Mexican food of my life.&nbsp; I highly prefer Chipotle over what I ate.&nbsp; On top of that, I think I got a mild jaw sprain from wincing so much due to the HORRENDOUS trumpet playing.&nbsp; When the meal was done, my wife got the check as fast as she could and we jetted out of there ASAP.<br /><br />Food: D<br />Portion Size: B<br />Value: F<br />Would I Recommend?&nbsp; NO WAY.&nbsp; Service, atmosphere, and food were very very unsatisfactory.&nbsp; Plus I got charged for things I didn&#039;t even order, not just once but twice.&nbsp; But even then, I can overlook everything as long as the food was good.&nbsp; But it clearly wasn&#039;t.&nbsp; I felt as if perhaps the head chef had stepped out and instead let the kitchen porter/dishwasher cook instead.&nbsp; And that would have been fine if he even half knew how to cook.&nbsp; Quite simply, this was one of the top 3 worst restaurant experiences in my life.&nbsp; Sorry, but I have to tell it like it is.

				I haven&#039;t been back since my first time there some time ago.&nbsp; I remember being really excited by the food descriptions on the menu, but being really disappointed with the lack of spice and flavor with my fajitas.&nbsp; It was strange, seeing as it&#039;s a Mexican restaurant.&nbsp; Sounds like your night was down right awful.&nbsp; And then to be charged for stuff you didn&#039;t even order!&nbsp; What a rip-off!

				Riteus, I really have to ask why you paid a penny for that meal.&nbsp; You obviously had a horrible experience, why oh why would you pay for it?&nbsp; Did you tip as well?&nbsp; Did you at least tell the manager your opinions?&nbsp; $50 bucks is a lot to blow on a meal these days and it only tells the restaurant they are doing the right thing.<br /><br />PS: This is not a slam on you, really.&nbsp; Just asking since you seem to be such a foodie and all.

Paying for what you ordered is one thing, but paying for things you didn&#039;t order... no. If you were paying by credit card this could be tough, as I could see the potential for them telling you they&#039;d take it off the bill and then billing you for the full price anyway, but what I would do in a case like this is cross out the things on the receipt I didn&#039;t order, write on the receipt that I did not order those items, leave cash for the rest, and then leave.

				Great point about paying...for both things I didn&#039;t order and for the food and service in general.<br /><br />Honestly, I felt bad.&nbsp; I could tell they were trying but just couldn&#039;t seem to get it right.&nbsp; First off, my wife and I debated quite a bit whether or not we should pay and if so, whether or not we should leave comments for the manager.<br /><br />The thing was this: it was a Friday night and I was taking my wife out on a date.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t want to make it into a big deal or make a big, nasty scene out of all of it.&nbsp; I wanted to try and smooth it over as much as possible.<br /><br />When they walked by and asked if things were ok, I&#039;d always say &quot;Yep, great.&quot;&nbsp; I did that except for when they repeatedly got my drink wrong.&nbsp; I was on the verge of making it into a big scene (honestly, how can you get DIET COKE wrong not just once but over and over and over again?!) but decided to just play it cool and internalize the frustration.<br /><br />Also, you could tell they were having a tough time with the trumpet guy in the band.&nbsp; Everyone including the customers, manager, bartender, waiters/waitresses was going bonkers.&nbsp; Honestly, that guy would have done humanity justice if he just never picked up another brass instrument (and most likely another instrument period) for the rest of his life.&nbsp; There was only 1 person who loved the trumpet, an older woman sitting at a table by herself.&nbsp; She somehow was enjoying the music and kept encouraging the trumpet to &quot;carry on the tune.&quot;&nbsp; That encouragement really boosted his confidence to trick himself into believing he was playing well.<br /><br />After that, when paying, we talked about whether or not to tip.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure who&#039;s fault it was, the wait staff, the bar, or the kitchen.&nbsp; In this economy, it&#039;s hard enough for a lot of people to make a living, so I just ponied up the cash and exited.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t want to make a scene and I genuinely wanted to help others.&nbsp; But you&#039;re right, it doesn&#039;t convey the point that the service, atmosphere, and food didn&#039;t merit any payment.&nbsp; I might have been better off staying at home with the wife and eating a bowl of cereal instead.
