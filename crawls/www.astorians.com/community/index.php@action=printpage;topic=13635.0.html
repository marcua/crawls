				I am currently looking to get a jump start on finding a Studio by the Broadway N/W line (or one N/W stop away in either direction) for a March 1st lease. I am an employed professional who works in Manhattan, but who has lived in Astoria for the past year and loves it!<br /><br />If you have a place available or are moving out and are looking for a great tenant who pays their rent on time please email me at elleh84@gmail.com.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks so much! :-)<br />

To be limiting yourself to certain parts of the &#039;hood, you might even need to go to $1350 to get a nice, relatively new and clean place.

				I agree that your price is a bit too low (you&#039;ll only find basement apartments or places with no kitchen at all at that rate) but $1,350 is definitely too high for a studio. My one bedroom (in an old but well-maintained building) is $1,100 and I&#039;m one block from the train. <br /><br />Most of the decent studios I saw in the area last year were going for an even $1,000 or $1,050. The current rental market might help you out a bit, but at $800-900 you&#039;re going to see some really scary places if you see any at all.

				Purplecurlygirl- Thanks for the advice.&nbsp; I&#039;m just trying to gauge the market, since with the economy there has been a dip in rental prices.<br /><br />Also, may I ask how you found your one bedroom?

				I used a broker--Jay at Tai Chi (I don&#039;t have his contact info anymore, but his ads might still be all over Craigslist). He showed me several places I liked and I applied for two of them. I think it was a 15% fee plus a small credit check fee. I didn&#039;t try to bargain the fee down, which I should have--you might have luck given the market now. <br /><br />Most other brokers showed me places that were subpar for living standards, which is where I got the $800=scary basement studio with a hot plate instead of a kitchen.

				I know you are probably in a hurry to find something, but you shouldn&#039;t go through a broker and stay away from buildings. The brokers are going to show you expensive apartments or total garbage for the price range you are looking at. I pay 1100 for my 2 bedroom in a private house and I know plenty of others that pay similar prices in this neighborhood. (I always gasp when I see what people in Astoria are paying and wonder how you can afford to eat.) Anyway, try getting the word out that you are looking. When we were looking we went to several realtors that told us we would never find anything for the price we wanted and showed us lots of terrible apartments that were out of our price range. We got the word out with friends and acquaintances that we were looking and sure enough a friend of a friend knew someone who was looking for a tenant and we were able to hook up right away. Maybe it was luck, but I think you shouldn&#039;t rule out that way of finding an apartment.<br /><br />Also, look at nearby neighborhoods if you are willing. My friend owns some homes in Woodside and had to reduce his rental fees on almost all of his apartments because everyone was moving out to buy co-ops or find cheaper rentals. Of course, he is the type of landlord that wants to keep his tenants for years, so that makes a difference.<br /><br />Good LUck!
