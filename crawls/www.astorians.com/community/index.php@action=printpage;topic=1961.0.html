				so i&#39;m planning on moving from jersey to astoria to start graduate school in the fall. i went and took a look around the area this past saturday, and it seems to me that there are two parts of astoria: the northern, more suburban end (lots of old people), and further south, where the more commercial district seems to be. i&#39;m looking for an area that&#39;s mostly younger people, like me. hopefully something near the train station. i think i like the area around broadway and steinway, i would like to be nearby an area that&#39;s bustling like that.<br /><br />also, is it possible to look in may/june for a place that i would want to move into in late august? most everything i&#39;ve read says that apartments start getting advertised about a month before the landlord wants the lease to start. <br /><br />any other general moving-to-a-new-apartment tips would be greatly appreaciated.

And late August is a peak rental period in all of New York, because of the academic year. Your best bet is to come every weekend or two starting at the beginning of July, and be prepared to rent starting August 1 or August 15th, if you want something specific. You might also wish you moved here 5 years ago, before demand for apartments in Astoria (and thus rents) was as high as it is now....<br /><br /><br />

				I have to agree with Harlan on this, Astoria&#39;s not really the suburbs.&nbsp; I think I live in the area you are thinking is the suburbs (more by the park), but young people are everywhere all over Astoria, and things to do and convenience abounds.&nbsp; Compared to places like Rego Park, Astoria is very young - I lived in Rego Park for a year, and ended up moving back, because I just didn&#39;t fit in with the age group, and all there was to do was shop.&nbsp; &nbsp;I lived in the bustling areas of Astoria, honestly found them too busy, loud, and dirty.&nbsp; But that&#39;s just me.&nbsp; Walk over 2 blocks and it&#39;s nice, clean, and quiet, yet within walking distance of everything you need.<br /><br />As far as getting an apartment, a month to 15 days before you are to move is when you will be able to find an apt.&nbsp; Be prepared to put a deposit on something if you like it right away.&nbsp; There are a smattering of brokers who will charge you 10-15% of a year, but there are enough that charge a month&#39;s fee still.&nbsp; I would stick with those.&nbsp; We aren&#39;t Manhattan, and I firmly believe the fees should reflect that.&nbsp; That said, Astoria has gotten ridiculously expensive and any of the new apts are small, too expensive for the closet space they are, and some don&#39;t even offer heat and hot water included.&nbsp; You&#39;re better off in a house or a rent-stablized unit.&nbsp; I have lived here 9 years, and just because you pay more, it doesn&#39;t mean you get better apts.&nbsp; Depends on the broker and the landlord.<br /><br />Good luck.

				I&#39;ve given the same advice to everyone who asks me if I know of any nice apartments in the area.<br /><br />Dedicate a weekend, Saturday <em>and</em> Sunday. Find which area of Astoria you prefer, and ring the doorbell of every super in every building you see. Find out how to get put on their landlord&#39;s list for available apartments, and then follow through.<br /><br />For example, my buildingâ€”pre-war, 140 apartments, huge rooms. My landlord owns hundreds of buildings in every borough of NYC. Their form asks for your preference of location. Once a credit check is done, and you are approved, you are notified 6 weeks in advance of availabilities. To make your life easier, be sure to give something to the super, if you end up renting an apartment in a building where the super helped you get the application form. I hate the practice, but it <em>is</em> expected, and should you need services, pecking order will apply!<br /><br />Good Luck<br /><br />NYCMacUser

				&nbsp;I happen to live right off Steinway/ Broadway... I call it &quot;downtown Astoria&quot;. It&#39;s more active and commercialized than the rest of the neighborhood. You have a choice of more than one train line (R, V, G, N) by living in this area and anything you need is conveniently located. I&#39;m not sure if there are more young people here. I would start looking by June because sometimes vacancies are known far in advance and apartments go fast.&nbsp; :-o

				Thanks for all the recommendations. I&#39;m going to try getting more familiar with the area by visiting some more over the spring before I officially start the apartment-hunting process. I&#39;ll definitely be referring back here frequently, thank you for being so helpful!
