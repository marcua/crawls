				<br /><strong>Spain unveils memorial to Madrid train bomb victims</strong> <br />March 11<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />A small glass tower channeling light into an underground chamber was unveiled as a memorial to victims of the Madrid train bombings, meters away from where the blasts killed 191 people exactly three years ago on Sunday.<br /><br />King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia inaugurated the memorial -- a glittering cylinder of glass brick -- less than a month after 29 suspects went on trial in the attack that ripped apart four rush-hour trains approaching Madrid&#039;s Atocha railway station.<br /><br />Around 1,800 people were injured by 10 bombs, which had been stuffed into sports bags and set off by mobile phones. One woman remains in a coma and hundreds others are still plagued by medical and psychological problems.<br /><br />On a sunny spring day, relatives of victims and survivors bowed their heads in silence as the king laid a wreath at the foot of the 11-meter (36 ft) tower -- its height a reference to the date Spain suffered its worst peace-time attack.<br /><br />The tower&#039;s architects -- five friends working on their first commission -- said the design&#039;s main ingredient was <em>light</em>.<br /><br />Sunshine hitting the column of 15,000 glass bricks focuses light into an empty, blue chamber below a busy highway, which the public can access via Atocha station.<br /><br />From below, visitors can peer skywards to read hundreds of messages of condolence and support wrapped around the inside of the cylinder.<br /><br />&quot;When the sunlight completely fills the chamber, it&#039;s like an explosion of light. It&#039;s a calm environment, a place of reflection,&quot; one of the architects, Esau Acosta, from firm Estudio FAM told Reuters.<br /><br />Three days after the bombs, Spain held general elections and voted out the conservative Popular Party (PP), a close U.S. ally, putting in its place a Socialist government that quickly fulfilled a pledge to pull Spanish troops out of Iraq.<br /><br />The trial of those accused of carrying out the attacks will hear from more than 600 witnesses and 100 experts before a panel of three judges gives its verdict, probably in early autumn.<br /><br />Separate commemorations were held at two other stations hit by blasts on Sunday.<br />
