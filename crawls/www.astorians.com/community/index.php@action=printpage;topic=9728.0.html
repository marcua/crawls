				30th Avenue and 14th Street and way, way west in Astoria, near the river.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is also near the Astoria Houses, a public housing project, that is a high-crime area.&nbsp; The Astoria houses are actually right on the water at the end of Astoria Blvd.&nbsp; Vernon Blvd. goes right by north to south.&nbsp; <br /><br />It is interesting how they situated the public housing projects in Astoria/Long Island City.&nbsp; &nbsp;They are &quot;in&quot; Astoria, not &quot;of&quot; Astoria.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Astoria Houses are actually on a peninsula.&nbsp; &nbsp;Two of the three sides are surrounded by water (the south &amp; west).&nbsp; &nbsp;Facing East at the end of Astoria Blvd. is a traffic circle that kind of separates Astoria from the rest of Astoria.&nbsp; North of the projects is Newtown Ave. (if Newtown is still called Newtown west of 21st) and there is one block of buildings north of the projects, though it is mostly industrial.&nbsp; &nbsp;There is a baseball field over there with a spectacular view of Manhattan.&nbsp; There is also a bus depot.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />The Queensbridge Houses, hard by the Queenborough Bridge, are also isolated.&nbsp; &nbsp;The southern barrior is the bridge, the western barrior is Vernon Blvd. &amp; a park, the western border are industrial buildings, though those &quot;luxury&quot; buildings being built on Queensboro Plaza are creeping also close.&nbsp; The southern border is more industrial buildings, a few apartments, some over priced stores and empty lots.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m sure the locations of these projects were carefully chosen and the demographics of the projects are very different from the rest of Astoria.&nbsp; &nbsp;There doesn&#039;t appear to be much integration (or interaction) between the people who live in those housing developments and the rest of Astoria.&nbsp; &nbsp;Those physical barriors that were created are also a psychological barrior.<br /><br />

				I wonder how much a place in an Astoria housing project goes for?&nbsp; I pay $1300 to look out my window at the building next to me, yet people in the projects get amazing Manhattan views across the river for probably around $500/month.&nbsp; They should start building the projects underground.

				It is ironic when you think about what they are paying to look at Astoria from the other side of the river and you compare to what they are paying in the Astoria houses.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had two jobs in my life where I&#039;ve had to go into the projects.&nbsp; &nbsp;The individual apartments are surprisingly well kept.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is the public areas where there are problems.&nbsp; &nbsp;Give credit where credit is due because New York City has done a commendable job in maintaining its public housing projects.&nbsp; &nbsp;Other cities implode their projects.&nbsp; &nbsp;In New York City there are waiting lists to get a spot in those projects.<br /><br />The problem is with the common areas.&nbsp; &nbsp;The elevators reek of urine.&nbsp; &nbsp;The smell is unbearable.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t know what type of human being urinates in an elevator.&nbsp; &nbsp;And then there is the safety issue.&nbsp; &nbsp;You take your life into your hands when you go in there.&nbsp; &nbsp;In one job, they wouldn&#039;t let us go into the projects alone.&nbsp; &nbsp;We had to have an escort.&nbsp; &nbsp;Safety in numbers I guess.<br /><br />The Queensbridge Houses actually have been much improved.&nbsp; &nbsp;I was in there &#039;89 and it was a real pit.&nbsp; Like much of the city it was out of control.The locks on the outside doors were broken and anyone could move in an out.&nbsp; &nbsp;I went back in &#039;00 and the city pumped some money in there and cleaned up the grounds and fixed the doors.<br /><br />I wonder what it is like to live in a place like the Astoria projects where you are part Astoria, but at the same time separated by race, class and geography.&nbsp; There must be a feeling of separateness and not being part of the greater community.

				When the Queensbridge Houses were built, the demographics of the population were much different than today.&nbsp; Also, the buildings were built specifically in such a way that all the windows look out onto something other than the buildings next door.

Those projects have been around forever, and as its been said, the area was a LOT different back then. For one thing, the &#039;quality of life&#039; i guess you&#039;d call it, was a completely different universe. The river was (more) polluted and gross, the air quality is horrific from all the exhaust from not only the bridge next to qb, but the sanitation dept next to ravenswood and the bus depot next to astoria, not to mention as its been pointed out, all these projects are surrounded by very industrial areas, lots of auto places, with lots of fumes coming out of them. And I don&#039;t think I need to mention the power plant. <br /><br />I find that last line extremely offensive. I&#039;m not from the projects, but I spent a very LARGE chunk of my childhood &amp; adolescence in qb &amp; ravenswood, and &#039;outsiders&#039; might not feel safe, (especially because if you are white, wearing nice clothes, and walking in there guarded, they figure you&#039;re a cop or some other &#039;threat&#039;) but there is a surprising sense of community among the people who live there. Everyone knows each others family, and they watch out for them. This is evident in the community parks, the associated in qb, you see moms tending to other moms children, especially if they got separated or hurt. Also in the local stores, those men that hang around outside the bodega, they <em>watch out</em> for their neighbors. <br /><br />I know I&#039;m going to get slammed for this because I can&#039;t find the words to justify my feeling at the moment, but I can not believe some of the remarks that have been made. Insensitive, ignorant, and downright snobby. It&#039;s a lot easier to look down your nose at someone than look them in the eye. I really didnt want to believe anyone actually thought like that. <br /><br />Let the neg nodding begin!

				I was pretty offended too.&nbsp; It&#039;s sad to see that people have such a mindset to even think that income based housing should be underground.&nbsp; Even if the comment was said in jest, the point is, the comment was made.&nbsp; I wanted to respond before, but I usually stay out of these discussions.&nbsp; Duska said it well, and much more diplomatically than I probably would have.

				I&#039;m with Daisy and Duska. <br /><br />I lived across the street from some projects in Morningside Heights in Manhattan for almost three years, and to be honest, my building might as well have been part of them except for what we were paying in rent (urine in the elevator, broken outside door locks, etc). The guys in front of the bodega WERE watching out for the &#039;hood, would help us carry heavy things, keep an eye on the kids, even stopped my roommate&#039;s car from getting broken into once. It was a little comforting knowing that someone I &quot;knew&quot; was around late at night if I felt unsafe. <br /><br />The interior parks inside the projects complex were always full of kids playing and mothers watching all the kids, not just their own. They&#039;d have birthday parties and picnics and other get-togethers, and a few times I was invited to join them as I walked by. There was a softball field always full of men and kids playing in the spring and summer, and the benches were always full of people watching them. <br /><br />Now, it wasn&#039;t rosy all the time--I know of at least two murders that happened while I lived nearby, including one that was pretty gruesome (some guy hacked up his girlfriend and her kid, and they weren&#039;t found for a while). Drugs were pretty common, and I heard shots a few times. And the motorcycle racing would drive me bananas in the summer. But to make any blanket statement that projects should be built underground or that they lack a sense of community is unfair and uninformed.

				Jeez, tough crowd.&nbsp; I don&#039;t really believe the projects should be built underground.&nbsp; The logistics of the digging and manpower would be---ok seriously, I was kidding.&nbsp; And I didn&#039;t attack families or communities, I was complaining about the view.&nbsp; &nbsp;However, this:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=9728.msg117434#msg117434">Quote from: duska3419 on March 11, 2008, 11:07:50 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />...in qb &amp; ravenswood, and &#039;outsiders&#039; might not feel safe, (especially because if you are white, wearing nice clothes, and walking in there guarded, they figure you&#039;re a cop or some other &#039;threat&#039;) but there is a surprising sense of community among the people who live there. <br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Since you brought it up, this kind of statement pretty much sums up why &quot;outsiders&quot; (white people, as you say) are uncomfortable around these areas.&nbsp; They clearly aren&#039;t welcome in what are perceived as, and in many cases in reality are, high crime areas.&nbsp; To pretend that they are not is just silly.&nbsp; When I am driving home from work past QB and Ravenswood late night, I get looks.&nbsp; Bad looks.<br /><br />If you want to be offended, ask neojapanese to join this thread.

				I don&#039;t think anyone said that it was the idea living condition and that they didn&#039;t have issues like crime, drugs, poor living conditions, whether caused by residents or bureaucratic neglect.&nbsp; Heck, even the rappers from the &#039;Bridge who made QB famous (NAS, Mobb Deep, Marley Mal, Roxanne Shante) have conflicted feelings about their environment; on one had they are proud of the area, but on the other they long to get out. But then again, isn&#039;t that the same story for everyone: at some point, many of us are looking to own a house or some sort of property and want a &quot;better&quot; life.&nbsp; <br /><br />I lived with a family in the Martin Luther King Houses in Harlem during the worst of the 1990&#039;s and I had many friends who lived in projects in four of the five boroughs.&nbsp; <br /><br />The family I stayed with had lived in the projects ever since they came from Puerto Rico in the 50&#039;s.&nbsp; The matriarch was a strong woman who raised three children and tried to support them with menial housekeeping jobs that paid little and offered no benefits.&nbsp; The patriarch was a salsa musician in Puerto Rico who was relegated to cleaning tables at clubs because black Latinos were not allowed to perform at the popular Latin clubs in NYC.&nbsp; <br /><br />The situation was far from idea, but when I needed a place to stay people who were considered the &quot;dregs of society&quot; helped me out.&nbsp; I relied on their kindness and generosity to see me through some pretty hard times.&nbsp; In the process, I became part of a community that I did not know existed because of my own prejudices.&nbsp; I could walk through the courtyard or into other buildings of the development and feel safe and actually welcome.&nbsp; When I got jumped on my way home from the 116th Street station, a group of kids from my building wanted to know who attacked me because they didn&#039;t want anyone messing with me as I had become part of the family.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, the story is much longer (I think this is a bit lengthy as it is) and there were a lot of things that I witnessed that someone who didn&#039;t grow up in the environment could never imagine, but this idea that &quot;the projects&quot; and those who live there can be judged in a certain way, is simply wrong and it prevents us from understanding our neighbors.&nbsp;
