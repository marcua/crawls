				Hi, <br />&nbsp;<br />I had a great visit to the Museum of Natural History this weekend and as an atheist, became curious as to what religious people thought of the science, evolution, etc. exhibits. If you&#039;ve never been, they explain how the planets were made, how life on earth came to be/evolved. I was wondering what someone who believed in God thought about these things. I am in no way trying to start an argument on the subject - just something that occurred to me, that people who believed in God as the creator walked these exhibits and I thought it would be interesting to get there take on it.<br />&nbsp;<br />Baglover

				I think that it&#039;s entirely possible to believe in God and evolution at the same time. I think that creationists would be confused / bewildered / offended, but the museum refers to itself as a &quot;scientific research and education institution&quot; which would lead me to believe the willfully ignorant would would likely steer clear of the place. <br />Personally I find the museum fascinating, and I like to think that God had a plan when she went and created the universe. <br />
