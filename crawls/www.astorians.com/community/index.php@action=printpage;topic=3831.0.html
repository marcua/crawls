				So I guess CBGB&#39;s has finally shut its doors.&nbsp; It was on the verge of closing for so long, that I became used to the situation, and never bothered to pay it a visit while I had the chance (that was a mistake).&nbsp; I am such a big fan of a lot of the bands that came out of there in the 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s (espcially Queens&#39; very own Ramones), but I arrived in NYC only in 2001, and at that point was not about to shell out a bunch of money to see bad punk rock.&nbsp; It has only hit me now that the quintessential CBGB&#39;s experience WOULD have been to go hear some bad punk rock.&nbsp; Well, a lesson learned too late.&nbsp; At least I got to see the Bouncing Souls in Washington Square Park at a free show to &quot;save CBGB&#39;s&quot; last spring- they played &quot;Argyle,&quot; and everyone jumped around an moshed like crazy.<br /><br />does anyone have any CBGB&#39;s experiences they want to share?

As far as Detour, it actually has people still showing up, and would be turned into a restaurant when it&#39;s closing.&nbsp; But the landlord is trying to screw them out of the lease so they can jack their rents.&nbsp; My point is that most places that close get turned into a cultural void, draining the city of yet another place to see/play music.&nbsp; CB&#39;s is a very unique situation.&nbsp; The building is owned by a homeless advocacy group, and isn&#39;t looking to just make a profit, as most landlords do when they close music venues.<br /><br />I was responding more to the fact that Dirk automatically assumed that the place was being turned into an elite expensive condo complex, which simply isn&#39;t true.&nbsp; So I don&#39;t feel quite as bad about a place closing if the building will be put to good use, and the landlord actually is trying to do something responsible.<br /><br />

				I am almost 100% positive that it is not being turned into a homeless shelter. &nbsp;I was involved, in my old job, in the early negotiations. &nbsp;I have never heard that they are going to open any shelter there and I think they would have said that if they were. &nbsp;I would imagine they find some other commercial venue. &nbsp;They operate a few beds above CBGB&#39;s but are more homeless services instead of an actual shelter. &nbsp;The area is very hostile to new shelters opening (they had two over the last few years within three blocks of CBGB&#39;s, so I doubt they could even get approval if they were going to go that route). &nbsp;<br /><br />What I understand it that BRC is going to re-rent out the space. &nbsp;Keep in mind, BRC does not own the building, they lease the building from the owners and were subleasing to CBGB&#39;s (who they inherited as tenant). &nbsp;Maybe I&#39;m being overly cynical, but I bet they give up their lease and the entire building complex along the Bowery gets developed. &nbsp;CBGB&#39;s wasn&#39;t in it&#39;s prime anymore, but it was always packed when I was in it, so I don&#39;t think it was lack of a draw. &nbsp;Granted, Hilly didn&#39;t pay his rent on time on many occasions, but they didn&#39;t exactly raise the issue when he was late, or irresponsible, they just moved to evict him instead of coming to terms.
