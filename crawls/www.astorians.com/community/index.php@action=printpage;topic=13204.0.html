				What are some car/taxi services in Astoria? I am not going far, just about 9 blocks to the subway from my apartment, but I&#039;m going to be carrying a lot of stuff. There aren&#039;t usually a lot of taxis in my area, so I&#039;d rather just call ahead and get one to come pick me up. I looked in the yellow pages, but found a lot of disconnected numbers. So what are some car/taxi services that people have used? How far in advance should I call? General prices?

				Olympic<br />718-626-8000<br /><br />They&#039;ve been around for 25+ years, and the drivers speak English. When they say &quot;in 10 minutes&quot; they&#039;re there in 10 minutes.

				This is beginning to sound like a commercial for Olympic!&nbsp; &nbsp;:-D<br /><br />I&#039;ve only used them once, but I have already stored their number in my cell phone because of their customer service, timeliness, and the really nice car that I rode in - I think it might have been a Mercedes!

				I&#039;ve been using Hoyt for 14 yrs. and love &#039;em. The guys are really courteous and they&#039;re pretty competitive with yellow cabs for prices. I&#039;ve taken them locally for errands in Astoria, too and they&#039;ve been great. (Like apt to storage space or movie theatre.) If it&#039;s an airport ride, I call the day before, but I&#039;ve also called in the morning to be picked up 10 minutes later and they were there.

				Can anyone recommend a trusted, reliable car service (not a taxi company) based in Astoria, or (more broadly) Queens? Many thanks!

				SmazenySyr, you can read above you in this thread or you can go here for a previous thread:<br />http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=2466.0<br /><br />(FWIW, I always use Olympic as well)

				I&#039;m an Equa fan. I&#039;ve tried only them, but I&#039;ve no reason to switch, except maybe prices? Maybe I&#039;ll shop around for prices from Astoria to LGA, since that is when I use them the most. How does $15 sound?

				Is there a minimum fare price if you need to go local in Astoria? (like 5-10 blocks/few avenues?)

				Grr. I took a calll-ahead Olympic car to JFK today, and the driver was pretty rude--even by taxi-driver standards. (Ok, most of the taxi drivers I&#039;ve met are by and large good people.) He insisted--for the duration of the ride--that our flight was leaving from another terminal, when I knew for sure that it was out of Number 1. He was so insistent that I began to imagine us having to hoof it between terminals. <br /><br />Anyway, if you want brusque, patronizing service, feel free; otherwise, I can&#039;t recommend them. Did we get there? Yes. In one piece, even? Yep. <br /><br />Did I really feel like it was worth $32, given the rudeness. No.
