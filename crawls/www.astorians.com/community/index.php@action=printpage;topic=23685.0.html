				Check out Basil Brick Oven Pizza on 28-17 Astoria Boulevard. This is a thin crust artisan pizza. In my mind, best pizza in Astoria.

				I will say i was not impressed with basil at all, I find the crust at Michaelangelos much better.&nbsp; For ny style pizza, Pizza palace used to be my favorite around ditmars, but it has gone downhill. There is a place on steinway right off 30ave that is great though, check that one out.

				Rizzo&#039;s (Steinway between 30th &amp; 31st Avenues)<br />They the best in Astoria imo....the cheese alone is better than all of Astoria pizza....<br />Just stay away from pizza palace on Ditmars, such a rip off.

				if you like extra toppings like me try Pollitos off Steinway and Broadway ... if you like grandmas pizza try Antika on 30th Avenue and 36th street and if you like other kinds of pizzas like alfredo or penne a la vodka try annies on 44th street and 25th avenue

				I also enjoy Rizzo&#039;s and old fashioned pizza.&nbsp; But for fancy, brick oven I second Basil Brick Oven.&nbsp; But also love Via Trenta on 30th.&nbsp; They have one or two pizzas that are delicious with truffle paste.&nbsp; Also DiWine on 31st Ave.&nbsp; They have a pizza with lobster and another with blue crab that are amazing.&nbsp; Both places have super hot brick ovens with wood fires.&nbsp; Thin, blistered crust and high quality toppings.

				I might be the only native Astorian who doesn&#039;t like Rizzo&#039;s. It was good back in the day, but I don&#039;t really think it&#039;s that great anymore. <br /><br />I may be in the minority, but I&#039;m a fan of Grand Ave. Pizza -- always have been. Also like Polito&#039;s and Gaudio&#039;s. I like Pronto&#039;s white pizza and when I want a thinner, brick oven crust, I go with Sac&#039;s. I wasn&#039;t impressed with Basil. For thin crust, Michael Angelo&#039;s is great, but it&#039;s not like a traditional, greasy, folded slice type of pie.<br /><br />The great thing with Astoria is that we have a lot of different pizza options to satisfy everyone.<br />

				I can&#039;t believe nobody has mentioned Rosario&#039;s yet.&nbsp; It&#039;s easily the best traditional slice in Astoria.&nbsp; They have a great selection of Italian groceries as well.<br /><br />Rosario&#039;s is right by the steps of the Ditmars Blvd station.<br />
