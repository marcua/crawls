				I have a lofty goal. And that is to do absolutely no productive work for The Man today. You know, to celebrate Labor Day. Early. And with anathema activities. Like websurfing, of course. But also: <br />Eating Cheez-Its<br />Trying to finish my summer novel<br />Looking for a new friggin job (already)<br />Taking inane photos with my camera phone<br />Making lists<br />Filing my nails<br />Thumbing through the TONY<br />Kickin&#39; it on astorians.com<br /><br />If they&#39;re going to make me show up for a <em>full day&#39;s</em> work on the Friday before a holiday (not getting early dismissal here, kids), I&#39;m damned if I&#39;m actually going to produce anything for them.

Having said that, its atill abit early (a week before you leave) to cite this project&#39;s infeasability to be completed. So, I would just try to make minimal progress while still keeping at the top of your priority list those projects that are going to be directly attributed to you. Thats&#39; just my two-cents. (I&#39;m tired of other people getting credit for my work!) But yeah, cashing in all your remaining sick days is totally the way to go.

				I ended up having NWW and NWTh this week, and was well on my way to NWF, but I got a call and ended up spending two hours coordinating a project.&nbsp; I was this close to dialling in from home today and pretending I was in the office, but because of the call it&#39;s actually a good thing I was in.&nbsp; Anyway... I&#39;m in for RWF for sure!
