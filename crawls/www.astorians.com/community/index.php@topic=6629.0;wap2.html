			i&#039;ve noticed that not all unread posts show up in the list.<br />i had just finished the last one on my list and then clicked the link again in case something new popped up and there was none.<br />then i went back to the main page and 3 categories said New.<br />thinking maybe it was a bonanza posting minute i went in and checked and there were new posts from yesterday. i went back to show unread posts and there were none, even though there were new posts in a few categories.<br />makes me think there&#039;s something screwy happening. <br />we can&#039;t miss a post!

			Hmm. Not sure why it would do that. Perhaps your session timed out, or could you have deleted cookies by chance?

			Occasionally that happens to me, too.&nbsp; When I click on &quot;Show unread posts since last visit&quot;, there are times when nothing shows up.&nbsp; If you look closely on days that happens, there will be a link that says &quot;Click here for all unread posts.&quot;&nbsp; Then it will show every post that you have not read since the last time you clicked &quot;mark all posts read.&quot;

			It does it to me as well, though not very often.
