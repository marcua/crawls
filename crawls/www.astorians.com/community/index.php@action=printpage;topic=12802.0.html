				FUN TOPIC! <br /><br />Casicua - I&#039;m glad you put about your dog first, because my #1 rule is that they must atleast accept my cat (Zoey &lt;----) and not be allergic to cats, non-smoker, no drugs, no excessive baggage that they are not over (ex wives, ex- girlfriends etc) and no facial hair... <br /><br />Though, maybe I am a bit picky, I&#039;ve been single a while....

				Man, I&#039;m amazed at how many of you would find me to be a deal-breaker! Well, I suppose I&#039;d rather date a smoker than a non-smoker anyway.<br /><br />I think, though, that most things are not deal-breakers for me. What really matters the most to me is an open mind. Don&#039;t like my pet right away? Well, what counts isn&#039;t whether or not you like &#039;em, but if you&#039;re willing to give it a try and adjust.<br /><br />I&#039;m not single, though, so I guess I don&#039;t count, but I think it&#039;s not any single thing that&#039;s a deal breaker, but the idea that someone wouldn&#039;t *try* to get used to some quirk or something that&#039;s important to me.<br /><br />Though, I can&#039;t date Yankees fans.

				A guy once told me, at the beginning of our relationship, &quot;ask me anything, I don&#039;t want to keep anything from you, ask me anything&quot;.&nbsp; A few months later, here was something I hadn&#039;t thought to ask him about: he told me, before we met, he had been asked to do a porn movie, and after saying yes, changed his mind and decided not to.&nbsp; I never knew whether or not to believe that he hadn&#039;t done it.&nbsp; <br /><br />So, although it&#039;s a deal breaker, I cannot imagine asking a guy I&#039;ve just met whether or not he&#039;s ever done porn, or even considered it.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

				No drugs or smoking of any kind. &nbsp;Alcohol is fine but of course I don&#039;t want an alcoholic.<br /><br />Respect for yourself and others. &nbsp;If a guy were to ever once get violent or possessive with me, I&#039;m out. &nbsp;A real man doesn&#039;t need to throw his aggression all over the place. &nbsp;If we&#039;re at a baseball game and you start fighting with the opposite&#039;s team&#039;s fans and then get thrown out, I&#039;m not impressed. &nbsp;<br /><br />Drugs and respect are the two big ones. &nbsp;I could list all the cliches of what I do want, but in the end (except for the two big ones), I&#039;m usually willing to compromise and work on things.<br /><br />Ignorance, racism, and homophobia are huge turnoffs.

				Huge fat belly is actually worse , health wise but very very skinny looks bad as well. People who are very into taling care of themselves , going to the gym , eating healthy , not smoking etc are most likely going to want someone the same . Its not always the case , but most of the times .&nbsp; &nbsp; The worst for me is when someone doesnt work out or take care of themselves and then in return will only want someone in great shape , and becomes the pickiest person when it comes to dating . I have some friends like that&nbsp; and to me it makes no sense.&nbsp; Like we would go out to bars , my friends being single wouldnt even look at a girl 5 lbs overweight , meanwhile their guts were hanging .

				Don&#039;t get me wrong- a gym rat is better than a beer belly redneck! But it&#039;s the guys who are so self-centered that they make all the noise dropping weights hard etc. If you&#039;re so strong, why can&#039;t you put the weights down <em>slowly </em> and count it as an extra rep?! :rolleyes:<br /><br />Guys who live beyond their means to impress people- always preferred guys who make a good living and drive old reliable cars, for example, over the reverse.

				True&nbsp; weight dropping really sucks and is annoying to others around you . <br />Most people now get caught up with all the &quot;toys&quot; out there .&nbsp; Leasing a new car when its costing u an arm and a leg , gas , full insurance&nbsp; and payments all add up to alot . Unless u use it almost everyday , its kinda of a waste .&nbsp; Going out to fancy dinners all the time , spending on big name brand handbags and shoes is something alot of women i know do . I think its good to live within your means while saving for a rainy day . The way the economy is and will probably be for a while , having saved in the past is a smart thing now .

				Religion is a big deal breaker for me when looking at a long-term dating situation. I don&#039;t think I could date someone who was devoutly religious or a regular church goer no matter how perfect they were for me otherwise.<br /><br />Of course, most religious people wouldn&#039;t want to date an atheist like myself anyway. <br /><br />It&#039;s always disappointing when an otherwise quality girl starts talking about their personal relationship with God on a date.

				I don&#039;t have a problem with people who are religious, as long as they have actually thought it out instead of blindly following dogma, and as long as they don&#039;t try to bludgeon me with their faith.&nbsp; I promise not to bludgeon them with mine.<br /><br />I do have a problem with racists, homophobes, the willfully ignorant, and abusers.&nbsp; Oh, and guys who are shorter than me make me feel like a giraffe.&nbsp; &nbsp;:|
