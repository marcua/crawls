				Hi,<br /><br />I&#39;m looking for a handyman in the Astoria area.&nbsp; There is a french door in my living room area that needs to be fixed.&nbsp; My landlady hasn&#39;t gotten around in finding someone to fix it-- it&#39;s been over two weeks and now she&#39;s claiming that it&#39;s difficult to find someone during the holidays.&nbsp; Please let me know if you know of a handyman.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks!
