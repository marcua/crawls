				<span class="bbc_u">Un-Genocide</span> v1.1<br /><span style="font-size: 10px;" class="bbc_size">(An unrhyming poem)</span><br /><span style="font-size: 9px;" class="bbc_size">by Zenox Zenopticon</span><br /><br />It's not useful to talk about these things, I know.<br />What can we <em>do</em> anyway?<br /><br />Rest assured,<br />9/11, Armenian Genocide, the Holocaust, Rwanda, American Indian Genocide...<br />These things Never<br />Happened. :-)<br />Sleep now... sleeep. Everything is O.kay<br />Watch T.V. now. Maybe Hotel Rwanda or Shindler's List... thank God it's only fiction. <br /><br />Wouldn't it be<br />disturbing if these things not only happened<br />but were far worse than any movie could depict. Really!<br />Thank god they're only actors! The dead will awake and walk off the Stage! &nbsp;The blood the ash<br />&nbsp;... it's all fake!<br />Eat.<br />Enjoy.<br />Enjoy the holidays. Merry Christmas. The Inquisition. <br />Turkeyday. Puritanical <br />Pigrims Victory over Heathendom!<br /><br />Buy! :-) :-) :-)<br /><br />No need to talk about unpleasantness. Unpleasantness anyway.<br />There is no con-spir-a-<em>cy</em>.<br />People that talk about these things are just depressed, stupid, nutty, &quot;intense&quot;, Crazy! weeird &amp;<br />all-worked up, over nothing to worry about really... <br />Congress will vote the <br />right way,<br />saving us yet again from Ourselves,<br />Freedom is <span class="bbc_u">never</span> an issue in <em>This</em> country.<br /><br />We are safe.<br />We are rich.<br />We are free.<br />We are strong.<br />We are poor.<br /><br />What goes on in Iraq or Africa <span class="bbc_u">stays</span> in Iraq or<br />Africa. They are just brown skinned turban wearing mother-f---g God-forsaken heathens anyway<br />Who actually <em>believe</em> they are going to Paradise with 700 Virgins when they die.<br />Not like us.<br />We're going to Heaven!<br /><br />Menezes' mom; She'll be alright.<br />Who really cares about Brazilians staying illegally in England (that's across the Ocean) anyway trying to <br />get an education.<br />Damn immigrants!!!<br />Crossing Our Borders!!!<br />He wasn't shot!<br />seven times in the head after<br />he wasn't detained after he didn't not run away, after he didn't not jump over <br />the turnstile after he wasn't not wearing a raincoat after witnesses didn't not <br />witness him after the cameras in London didn't not fail to record him...<br /><em>Mysteriously... ...</em><br /><br />2300 victims plus plus 15,000 victims (some without legs), plus plus tens of thousands of victims... in just a couple years...beating a world <br />record...beating Vietnam...<br />well... they're just part of the Insurgency anyway. None were Civilians, driving <br />home from work or picking up the groceries or trying to sleep at home with their <br />families,<br />In the middle<br />of the<br />Night.<br /><br />None of them were children. All guilty all deserving. Why don't we just release the H-bomb!<br />Everybody else is doing it! Every other Nation that is.<br />Plus plus 30,000 unemployed by <br />GE (http://money.cnn.com/2005/11/21/news/gm_uaw.reut/). 30,000 with family doesn't equal 90,000.<br /><br />We are an Affluent Nation,<br />A Nation that watches &quot;Friends&quot;.<br />A Nation that likes to Paaar-Tay!<br />WooooOoo Hooo!<br />Merry Christ Mass you Filthy Effing heathens!
