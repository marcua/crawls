				Interesting to finally see it mentioned somewhere:<br />http://gothamist.com/2010/04/12/many_subway_bathrooms_are_overflowi.php<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve never seen a nastier bathroom in my life.

				If I feel I can&#039;t make it the extra 5-10 minutes to get home from the Ditmars Blvd. stop, then I always choose to use the McDonald&#039;s bathroom that&#039;s just outside the station.<br /><br />I worked at a McD&#039;s as my first job, and have seen my share of disgusting things in those bathrooms.&nbsp; The fact that McD&#039;s keeps a cleaner bathroom than the MTA says a lot in my book.

				Based on the cleanliness of most stations AND trains... why is anyone surprised that the bathrooms are at least the same, if not worse?<br /><br />It seems if you&#039;re drunk, partied out or homeless, then the entire transit system becomes your toilet anyway.&nbsp; After living in NYC for 2 years, I&#039;ve witnessed several times people vomitting or urinating both within the stations and on trains.&nbsp; In one case, a bum walked between cars while we were in motion and urinated off the side of the car/tracks while on an elevated/outdoors area of the route.&nbsp; If I were either walking or driving underneath the train at the time, I&#039;d be pretty pissed off for getting pissed on.<br /><br />For the rest of us, the rationale forced upon us by the lack of sanitation bascially gives us a series of unwanted choices... use a disgusting bathroom, use a public/inappropriate space, or hold it (at the cost of increasing discomfort, possible health risks or eventually having an &quot;accident&quot;).<br /><br />I know with the vast population of NYC that uses the transit system on a daily basis, it must be almost impossible to keep the bathrooms very &quot;fresh&quot;... but maybe a more concerted effort by the MTA to keep things at least considerable for people in times of an emergency would help keep the rest of the station and city a little more sanitary.

				Nothing has changed much in the last 50 years. When I was a teenager and used a subway urinal out of desperation I always felt the city was looking after everyones health by putting signs up that proclaimed &quot;VD Can BE Cured&quot;...encouraging news for those who needed it but kind of scary for the innocent traveler who was standing there reading it and wondering how far germs can jump.

				Hahaha, I have seen people go in there but never ventured in myself. My apartment in a block and a half away, and if its a serious emergency I always make it to the corner of 31st and Ditmars and go into the Starbucks.<br /><br />I have always been curious to see just how gross it is in there, but I have been too worried that the smell will make me vomit profusely to actually venture in.
