			And the &quot;funny&quot; thing is that as far as animal cruelty goes, foie gras isn&#39;t nearly as bad as what they do in industrial chicken farms. The ducks fed for foie gras tend to be fairly free-range for all but the force-feeding phase of their life, and ducks don&#39;t have a gag reflex so putting a tube down their throat isn&#39;t all that cruel. In contrast, most chickens spend their entire lives in a cage the size of a sheet of paper in a huge barn that reeks of ammonia, and have their beaks snipped. I&#39;d rather be a foie gras duck than a McNugget chicken any day of the week...<br /><br />Here&#39;s what one chef who spent some time force-feeding ducks had to say about it. And here&#39;s another take, with some photos.<br /><br />

			Yeah, the whole force-feeding thing sounds a lot worse than it is.&nbsp; While it may be somewhat uncomfortable, it&#39;s not as though birds ever chew and swallow--all that work is done internals through the gizzard.<br /><br />As far as humane foods go, I&#39;d say beef is probably the best thing you can eat.&nbsp; I spent some time on a cattle ranch in Oklahoma last year and the whole operation was very pleasant.&nbsp; Cows just naturally require so much square footage that it makes cruelty fairly impossible.&nbsp; Chicken and pigs, not so much.&nbsp; :|

			so glad I am a selective consumer who only purchases organic free range and only on a small scale since I am a single consumer...
