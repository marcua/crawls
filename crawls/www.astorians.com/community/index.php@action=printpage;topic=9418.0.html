				Title: <strong>Muslims  in Astoria</strong><br />
				Post by: <strong>FZ</strong> on <strong>February 09, 2008, 03:54:48 PM</strong>

			<dd class="postbody">
				Let me&nbsp; preface this by saying I have lived with people who are Muslim, in close quarter&nbsp; situations, for years so this is&nbsp; NOT about&nbsp; ALL&nbsp; Muslims here or anywhere&nbsp; else.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />I find it disturbing, several incidents, and just general observation, that the open door and arms that has been allowed&nbsp; in the US, NY and Astoria in particular, may be inviting future trouble. Yes, there&nbsp; have been and are folks who like to lead separate lives&nbsp; in our&nbsp; fair city, due&nbsp; to cultural&nbsp; taboos and&nbsp; differences, but, all&nbsp; seem to intermingle at some point. Since, 9/11, I have noticed an explosion of immigration of&nbsp; Muslims&nbsp; into the Astoria&nbsp; area, Mosques and Shops&nbsp; on Steinway street.&nbsp; I go into stores, some refuse to&nbsp; have &#039;gambling&#039;&nbsp; or sell &#039;beer/alcohol&#039; when they once&nbsp; sold it, cause as one put it, it is&nbsp; &#039;against&nbsp; our laws.&#039;&nbsp; Fair enough, you work or own it, you can sell what you want, but, the guy, whenever I go back is constantly praying, has a photo of Mecca and &#039;leaders&#039; on his wall, and sometimes&nbsp; I&#039;m waiting so long I just leave. I was in gas station&nbsp; recently, on 20th Avenue, near&nbsp; the entrance&nbsp; to the Con Ed Power&nbsp; plant. Several&nbsp; times in the late&nbsp; evening I saw&nbsp; two of those&nbsp; guys&nbsp; taking photos&nbsp; of the plant, one guy with a beard and&nbsp; hat, it seems whenever&nbsp; I pull in, is on his rug praying in the back. This afternoon, I went to get gas, another&nbsp; guy, I never saw, praying again, comes out and I was going to buy gas, and fill my tires with air, so I asked him for 4 quarters for my dollar. He said I have&nbsp; no qaurters and &#039;You Go&#039;, waving me off. So, I said I&#039;m a costumer here&nbsp; all the time, no reason to be rude, where upon I heard this guy mutter something about ALLAH and&nbsp; &#039;Kafir!&#039;&nbsp; Now, having lived with Muslims, I know this means infidel, where upon I launched into&nbsp; my own version of outrage and said all you had to say was &#039;sory , sir I have no change... &quot;why I say&nbsp; sorry&nbsp; to you&quot;... and he yelled &#039;Kafir&#039; in my face.&nbsp; &quot;You NO speak bad to me&quot;.. OK!! said&nbsp; this guy and he went in&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to the shop. So I left.&nbsp; I have had several run ins lately,and it appears&nbsp; there&nbsp; are&nbsp; people&nbsp; in this area, if not Al Qeada or Taliban, certainly sympathisers. I think at some&nbsp; point, the Islamic&nbsp; community, much as the Germans and Japanese&nbsp; during WW 2, would do well to step up and help weed out these individuals who may be infilitrating. I know the&nbsp; suspicion will breed&nbsp; well-founded&nbsp; fear, and this could lead to an ugly situtation. I know, I used&nbsp; to frequent some stores&nbsp; for Falafell&nbsp; and&nbsp; deserts, even in the past&nbsp; traveling to Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn, before&nbsp; some opened&nbsp; here, but, I&#039;m reluctant lately and very uncomfortable&nbsp; with the &#039;new&#039; arrivals, especially&nbsp; of the last&nbsp; few years.

				I&#039;m sorry but nothing in the experiences you talk about above would make me think that &quot;Al Queda&quot; or the &quot;Taliban&quot; are in Astoria. Just because they use the name &quot;Allah&quot; when cursing instead of &quot;God&quot;, and call you an &quot;infadel&quot; instead of a &quot;jerk&quot; doesn&#039;t make them evil or terrorists.

				If you genuienly suspect that there&#039;s a problem I suggest you call 800-NYC-SAFE. But as for general feelings of &quot;more Muslims moving in&quot;, and &quot;bad feelings&quot; about a place, these are comments that seem to be easily misunderstood; especially in the context of using the &quot;we&#039;re at war&quot; argument. Whether we&#039;re at war or not doesn&#039;t make a difference to me. If you have concerns they should be raised - but posting here doesn&#039;t really seem like it will do much.<br /><br />If one suspects foul play then they should do something about it (and contact authorities) regardless of whether we are &quot;at war&quot; or not.

				Did you notify police about them taking photos of Con Ed? I see nothing suspicious about praying, saying &quot;Allah&quot;, calling you an infidel....but if anyone thinks that taking photos of the plant is not suspicious behavior, then you are mistaken. There is nothing aesthetically pleasing about that dump....

				You know...I&#039;m not a racist.&nbsp; My father traveled all over the world and was a very cosmopolitan man and thanks to him I know about different cultures, their foods, their beliefs and he taught me that even though we have different customs we are all God&#039;s children but like in ALL cultures and religions there are fanatics.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been to the gas station in question right on 20th in front of ConEd and as I was driving by a couple of times I thought I saw the men there taking pictures but then I said to myself...oh bah, I&#039;m being paranoid, but now that another person says they saw them taking pictures...that&#039;s what they were doing.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been to that gas station and one time I waited so long that I got out of the car and asked the attendant for service and they just ignored me and got a dirty look and said something to me that I didn&#039;t understant (I don&#039;t know what language it was just that it wasn&#039;t italian, greek, spanish or french) so I left and never went back.<br /><br />Maybe we should call and have them checked out, you never know.<br /><br />

				It seems odd that in broad daylight people would be taking photos of Con Ed.&nbsp; My thought is that if they are planning something, they would be very covert about taking photos; perhaps doing it at dawn or from their roof.&nbsp; Anyway, if you see something suspicious, say something.&nbsp; I would like to share a story -<br /><br />Right after 9/11, I noticed a lady in Astoria Park hiding behind trees.&nbsp; She looked very suspicious and was dressed in long garments and a head scarf.&nbsp; I noticed her hiding behind a tree when I left home to run an errand.&nbsp; When I returned half an hour later, she was still hiding.&nbsp; I decided to call the police.&nbsp; I did not think that she was dangerous, but if you recall, the Triborough Bridge was considered a target, so I became worried.&nbsp; However, my gut told me that she was hiding from something and that she was in danger.&nbsp; I was right.&nbsp; She had been followed by some kids who were throwing stones at her because she looked like a Muslim.&nbsp; She was frightened and began to cry when the Police came.&nbsp; I came out to speak to her and the Police drove her home.<br /><br />It is better to be on the safe side, so instead of wondering why these folks are taking photos, call that special number that the city advertises for this purpose.<br /><br />Oh and the ad I saw was a website for single Muslims who want to meet each other!

				go singlemuslims.com!!! 8-)<br /><br />I don&#039;t know that I agree that there&#039;s been an &#039;influx&#039; of Muslims to Astoria since 9/11. But I could understand why if there has been. Immediately after 9/11 Muslim-Americans (I really hate sounding so PC but I don&#039;t know how else to refer to them) faced lots and lots of misdirected anger/resentment/etc. from other nationalities.There&#039;s a LOT of less understanding places than NYC in America. OMG I&#039;ve rewritten my next sentences three times. I can&#039;t express myself clearly, especially if I&#039;m tip-toeing so as not to offend anyone. I don&#039;t mean to offend anyone. I&#039;m just going to say this. There are places in America where &#039;patriotic Americans&#039; are a lot less understanding than people in big cities. When immigrants um ... immigrate to a foreign country without knowing anyone there, they tend to head for the big cities, the ones they&#039;ve heard of, where the work is. In more rural areas there are less Muslims for this reason. In such towns, the &#039;patriotic Americans&#039; tend to be a lot less understanding and intolerant of people who look different. Especially if they look like the people who just attacked the US. It wouldn&#039;t surprise me if there actually was an influx of Muslims into Astoria, because there already was a considerable amount of them here. And the ones who were here, probably had family and/or friends who lived elsewhere and felt threatened and unsafe. Granted, it might seem strange for them to move into one of the cities that just got attacked, but, at least they will be with family/friends who can help, and they can look after each other. If you are &#039;under attack&#039; because you look different, you turn to people who look like you for help, that&#039;s whats happened in this country over and over, hell maybe it&#039;s human nature! <br /><br />Holy unexpected rant batman! sorry guys. I still have a story for you too!<br /><br />As some of you might have figured out by now I don&#039;t live in Astoria, I live in Sunnyside. The awesomest 99cent store in NYC is on Queens Blvd between 41st &amp; 42nd and it&#039;s run by Muslims (truth be told I don&#039;t know if they&#039;re actually Muslims. They look Middle Eastern, I&#039;ve never stopped to ask anyone there what religion they practice). There&#039;s a Irish Pub right next door, I think it&#039;s called Maggie Mays. So one Tuesday at like 3pm I&#039;m walking toward the 99store, when some drunk Irishman stumbles out of the pub. His friend is right behind him, but a lot more coherent. There&#039;s an employee of the 99cent store arranging brooms or something that are on display on the sidewalk in front of the store. The drunk Irishman has been screaming incoherently to his friend for a couple minutes, and the friend is just laughing at him. Then the drunk gets up and swings at the Muslim guy, who starts screaming in whatever language. The only word I understood coming out of the drunk&#039;s mouth was &#039;TERRORIST&#039; and he was screaming. His friend was trying to pull him off the guy, and almost succeeded, but 3 or 4 more male employees of the 99cent store came out holding weapons, one was a bat, the other a wooden broomstick, the other i don&#039;t remember but similar home-defense weapon. They didn&#039;t fight much, the not-so-drunk friend had pulled his drunken buddy away and was screaming apologies for him and that he didn&#039;t want any real trouble. The employee who&#039;d been first struck was bleeding very badly. After witnessing this I half ran to the store I bought cigarettes from, the guy there was an older Muslim man, sweet a man as you&#039;ve ever met. We called him grandpa. I told him what I&#039;d just seen and I told him to be careful, the whole time with tears in my eyes. I think I ought to mention I was 15 at the time. (Spare me the lecture about underage smoking or smoking at all I&#039;d been smoking <em>regularly</em> since age 12 and I stopped this past July cold turkey for absolutely no reason, and grandpa was still a good man even though he was known for selling cigarettes to minors)<br />Needless to say, this happened a week after 9/11/2001. My point in telling this story, is if this kind of crap happened here, imagine what happened to the only Muslim family in town in some obscure town in a rural state. <br />[end rant]

				Ok, here&#039;s a good ABC news piece about cameras in public spaces which notes that there have been successes in catching criminals in London&#039;s &quot;ring of steel.&quot;&nbsp; The article also gives fair play to the concerns of civil libertarians: http://www.abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=3422372&amp;page=1<br /><br />In my mind, we should not go overboard with cameras but they are useful if nothing else than because they are a good prosecutorial tool after a crime has been committed.&nbsp; Sorry if this is too OT.

				I don&#039;t know about the prevalence of the Al-Queda/Taliban-type of Muslims in Astoria, but I do know that long before 9/11, there was and still remains a large, very vibrant Muslim Bengali community around 36th Avenue, in particular the area west of the N train.&nbsp; Bengali&#039;s from all over the area and sometimes the region, as my friend who owned one of the establishments informed me, go there to socialize and eat.&nbsp; <br /><br />Before 9/11 and as long as I can remember the area, there has been two mosques on both sides of the 36th Avenue N stop and they serve a very diverse group of Muslims in the area.<br /><br />From my own experience, which includes hanging out in the homes of pretty conservative Yemen and Bengali Muslims (hope nobody reports me), I find many of the even conservative Muslims, at least before the latest Iraq war, to be fairly reasonable and willing to adapt to American society, as long as it does not compromise their faith.&nbsp; In other words, they are not going to have beers with the guys after work.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t mean that they are going to commit violence against the bars.&nbsp; <br /><br />And the Muslims that I knew didn&#039;t want to start a jihad in America.&nbsp; In fact, you would be surprised how much they have in common with fundamentalist Christians.&nbsp; Again, with the point about broad generalizations being fresh in my mind and on this board, I would emphasize that this does not apply to all people of Muslim faith.&nbsp; I&#039;m simply relaying my own experience and I&#039;m sure other people have had their own negative experiences.<br /><br />Regarding the overall picture of the Middle Eastern and South Asian population in America, which again is hard to generalize.&nbsp; I believe that the latest studies, which I don&#039;t have available right now, but I will try to find, show that they are solidly middle class and educated, unlike many of the European Muslim South Asian, North African and Middle Eastern population.&nbsp; I think a lot of it has to do with racial and ethnic conflicts there, although I could be totally off.&nbsp; While the US is far from being perfect, I don&#039;t think we have the same entrenched social issues and many of the Muslim faith who live here, no matter where they are from, are not radicalized through class, racial, religious and/or ethnic divides.&nbsp; <br /><br />Pardon the long post.&nbsp;

				In regards to AstoriaLuv&#039;s last posting about some Muslims he has known:&nbsp; For me, at least, the point is not about people of any specific faith, ethnicity, whatever.&nbsp; If I saw Klaxxorne, a tourist from Mars, and he/she/it was taking pictures of bridges, had a house with a minimal ammount of furniture and lots of magazines about weapons, and was taking classes in chemistry, I&#039;d still probably report Klaxxorne.&nbsp; I would never advocate reporting people because of their faith, or where they come from.

				As somebody who looks to some people as if he is Arabic, who could regale you with thrilling tales such as being pursued in a high-speed (120mph) car chase by Homeland Security agents in unmarked cars outside Philadelphia, who has been suddenly surrounded by siren-blasting police cars on the Mall in Washington DC (halfway between the Washington Monument and Capitol Building), who has been asked by policemen NOT to take pictures in the middle of the day in public places like Union Square... all of this life-threatening and oppressive behavior a reaction to my taking pictures....<br /><br />Is taking pictures &quot;suspicious activity&quot;? In my experience, it depends on the appearance of the person taking the pictures. <br /><br />I know for a fact that there are police who make snap judgments based on nothing more than physical appearance and that there are people who report other people to the police based on nothing more than physical appearance. <br /><br />I wish it weren&#039;t the case, but it is. Maybe your perspective on this would be difference if you had had police surround you, check your ID, ask you why you&#039;re taking pictures of the JEFFERSON MEMORIAL (e.g., Who are you? Why are you so interested in taking pictures here? Why now, at sunset? Stop telling us about &#039;the lighting&#039; and tell us what your business is here?, etc.&quot;, scribble notes about how you&#039;re a professional photographer and video producer, and then order you to stop taking pictures even after their background check is complete and you&#039;re supposedly &quot;cleared.&quot; <br /><br />In other words, &quot;suspicious activity&quot; just became an excuse to intervene in my life and tell me what I could or couldn&#039;t do, even after I was supposedly no longer suspicious and should have enjoyed the same rights as any of my fellow American citizens. Of course, my lilly-white photographer friends are surprised by all of this. I am off-white, it turns out. <br /><br />Intimidating, enraging, and demoralizing. Has the country become safer as a result of law enforcement behavior like this? I think it&#039;s become more dangerous. At least for people who look a certain way.<br /><br />Is buying a one-way, first class airplane ticket in cash at the gate suspicious activity? Yes, I think that&#039;s odd. And there were rules against doing this before 9/11, which, if they had been followed, would have saved thousands of lives that day. Is it suspicious that not a single individual was ever held accountable for the gross mistakes and negligence that made it possible for the 9/11 attackers to get away with murder? Yeah, I think that&#039;s pretty damned suspicious. <br /><br />Is it suspicious that NYC and the U.S. had years to improve first-responder communications systems after the first WTC attack and did absolutely nothing? Yeah, absurdly suspicious. Makes one wonder what the hell these security people are doing for a living?&nbsp; <br /><br />***<br /><br />&quot;Muslims in Astoria&quot;?&nbsp; :roll:&nbsp; <br /><br />You don&#039;t mean me, because I&#039;m a capitalist free-thinker born in America. But you do mean me, because if you walked by me on Steinway St. I might be mistaken for &quot;them.&quot; Maybe you saw me and didn&#039;t recognize me and thought I was one of the new ones flooding into the neighborhood.<br /><br />FZ, ultimately, it&#039;s not a crime for a person to call another person... ANYTHING, let alone an infidel. It&#039;s not a crime to love or hate people for completely irrational reasons. It&#039;s not a crime to sympathize with Osama bin Laden. It&#039;s not a crime to hate the government of the U.S. or to attack the Western way of life. As soon as we make these things crimes... we don&#039;t want to live in that kind of country, do we?<br /><br />We report crimes to the police. Or we make them aware of people who we have reason to believe may be planning to commit crimes. <br /><br />It&#039;s not a good business practice to insult prospective customers, but it&#039;s not a crime either. Suspicious? What do you suspect? That the gas station is a front for a terrorist cell? Because you saw a guy praying, taking pictures of a structure across the street from him, and a guy was a jerk to you? <br /><br />FZ, you should follow your best judgment, of course. I don&#039;t trust your judgment, but I hope the police will take you at your word and do a decent job of looking into your complaint without violating anybody&#039;s liberty rights.

				Although I appreciate you responding to one line of my post, you ignored the rest. This is not a whim. From at least 2 posts on this thread, we know that:<br /><br />A. This person is Angry<br /><br />B. They are Devout<br /><br />C. On at least 2 occasions, they have been seen photographing a power plant. <br /><br />If I walked by an abortion clinic and I saw someone taking photos of said clinic from a van owned by a Christian church, you better believe I will be on the phone. The two situations are no different. The reason: I&#039;d rather live with the guilt of knowing that one innocent person was interrogated for a few hours or even a day then knowing that because of my inaction, an innocent person or persons lost the rest of their days. At one point to you notify authorities? When the person in question has gun-in-hand?

He replied, it&#039;s&nbsp; OK, &#039;as long as&nbsp; Muslim law&nbsp; is not in control.&#039; As for any other fundamentalists, if some sect started&nbsp; saying they would take over the country and behead&nbsp; gay people, close down bars and generally roll back all our freedoms, they&#039;d&nbsp; get the same post.

In my experience, it depends on the appearance of the person taking the pictures. <br /><br />I know for a fact that there are police who make snap judgments based on nothing more than physical appearance and that there are people who report other people to the police based on nothing more than physical appearance. <br /><br />I wish it weren&#039;t the case, but it is. Maybe your perspective on this would be difference if you had had police surround you, check your ID, ask you why you&#039;re taking pictures of the JEFFERSON MEMORIAL (e.g., Who are you? Why are you so interested in taking pictures here? Why now, at sunset? Stop telling us about &#039;the lighting&#039; and tell us what your business is here?, etc.&quot;, scribble notes about how you&#039;re a professional photographer and video producer, and then order you to stop taking pictures even after their background check is complete and you&#039;re supposedly &quot;cleared.&quot; <br /><br />In other words, &quot;suspicious activity&quot; just became an excuse to intervene in my life and tell me what I could or couldn&#039;t do, even after I was supposedly no longer suspicious and should have enjoyed the same rights as any of my fellow American citizens. Of course, my lilly-white photographer friends are surprised by all of this. I am off-white, it turns out. <br /><br />Intimidating, enraging, and demoralizing. Has the country become safer as a result of law enforcement behavior like this? I think it&#039;s become more dangerous. At least for people who look a certain way.<br /><br />Is buying a one-way, first class airplane ticket in cash at the gate suspicious activity? Yes, I think that&#039;s odd. And there were rules against doing this before 9/11, which, if they had been followed, would have saved thousands of lives that day. Is it suspicious that not a single individual was ever held accountable for the gross mistakes and negligence that made it possible for the 9/11 attackers to get away with murder? Yeah, I think that&#039;s pretty damned suspicious. <br /><br />Is it suspicious that NYC and the U.S. had years to improve first-responder communications systems after the first WTC attack and did absolutely nothing? Yeah, absurdly suspicious. Makes one wonder what the hell these security people are doing for a living?&nbsp; <br /><br />***<br /><br />&quot;Muslims in Astoria&quot;?&nbsp; :roll:&nbsp; <br /><br />You don&#039;t mean me, because I&#039;m a capitalist free-thinker born in America. But you do mean me, because if you walked by me on Steinway St. I might be mistaken for &quot;them.&quot; Maybe you saw me and didn&#039;t recognize me and thought I was one of the new ones flooding into the neighborhood.<br /><br />FZ, ultimately, it&#039;s not a crime for a person to call another person... ANYTHING, let alone an infidel. It&#039;s not a crime to love or hate people for completely irrational reasons. It&#039;s not a crime to sympathize with Osama bin Laden. It&#039;s not a crime to hate the government of the U.S. or to attack the Western way of life. As soon as we make these things crimes... we don&#039;t want to live in that kind of country, do we?<br /><br />We report crimes to the police. Or we make them aware of people who we have reason to believe may be planning to commit crimes. <br /><br />It&#039;s not a good business practice to insult prospective customers, but it&#039;s not a crime either. Suspicious? What do you suspect? That the gas station is a front for a terrorist cell? Because you saw a guy praying, taking pictures of a structure across the street from him, and a guy was a jerk to you? <br /><br />FZ, you should follow your best judgment, of course. I don&#039;t trust your judgment, but I hope the police will take you at your word and do a decent job of looking into your complaint without violating anybody&#039;s liberty rights. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well, I&#039;ve&nbsp; been stopped and questioned, cause.. surprise , surprise, I look&nbsp; &#039;Middle-Eastern.&#039;&nbsp; If you <br />sympathise with Osama Bin Laden, you are MY enemy, plain and simple. Anyone who wants&nbsp; to say anything, even people&nbsp; from One Party, Communist or Muslim states do have a right to say anything, and I have a right to tell them where to go, you are correct. You could love Hitler, Hate&nbsp; Jews, hate&nbsp; Christians, Gays, Lesbians, but, when you &#039;hate&#039;&nbsp; certain groups&nbsp; it has become a &#039;crime.&#039; But, this thread is&nbsp; about the very real threat&nbsp; and it is ongoing and&nbsp; the influx after 9/11&nbsp; would&nbsp; be&nbsp; a concern under any practical judgement.

I am indeed a busy person, but I have to put gas in my car every once in a while (it is a hybrid) and why not see what these guys are like firsthand?&nbsp; It is out of curiosity.<br /><br />You may be right - I am not a big fan of Conservatives and quite frankly, I may be unjustly blaming those people who voted for Bush (especially those who voted for him twice) for this mess we are in.&nbsp; I know a couple of Republicans pretty well and I remind them every time I see them (they are heavy contributors to the party) of the current debacle.&nbsp; I would like someone out there to say &#039;we were wrong.&nbsp; George Bush has made a mess of this great country.&nbsp; <br /><br />Billz - quite frankly, I do not care about whether people believe what I say or not.&nbsp; I am probably twice the age of most folks on this blog and as a result, have had more experiences in life.&nbsp; If anyone is interested however, they are welcome to PM me and I would be happy to show them the business card of one of the FBI Agents, which I held on to.&nbsp; Also, if you check with any of the original members of AFPJ, they can certainly tell you about my being stopped at the tollbooth.&nbsp; Finally, my husband was in our car when those &#039;Patriots&#039; knocked me down.<br /><br />I am successful in business because I worked hard for it, just as I am sure you work hard and will be successful (I too read your posts with interest).&nbsp; &nbsp;Also, I do not know more gay people than anyone else, nor am I more successful than anyone else.&nbsp; You are misquoting me.&nbsp; If you are going to quote me, then do so accurately please.<br /><br />My two points in my previous statement served their purpose, and I point them out to every Conservative I meet whenever the subject arises:<br /><br />Conservatives tend to imply that Liberals are not business people, that we do not know how to make money and conduct business.&nbsp; I like to remind them that there are many people who are financially successful&nbsp; but socially progressive.<br /><br />Also, Conservatives often imply that Liberals are not patriots and do not love this country.&nbsp; This too is misguided.&nbsp; At the beginning of the Iraq war, some of my neighbors immediately put the flags out but did not lift a finger to assist the troops in any way.&nbsp; I chose to do the opposite.<br /><br />I will not forget the absolutely ridiculous behavior at the time - Freedom Fries, dumping of French wine etc.&nbsp; We looked like immature imbeciles to the entire world.<br /><br />Anyway, I feel that there is someone out there on this forum who constantly puts down Muslims and is extremely paranoid and I want to see what is going on at this garage.&nbsp; By the way, he is Greek but has lived with Muslims from every Muslim country!&nbsp; Quite impressive indeed!&nbsp; <br /><br />Sorry you find my posts snide in content.&nbsp; You may be correct but I cannot help but hold Bush supporters responsible for our current situation.&nbsp; From what you have said on previous posts, you are not a fan of Bush and I respect that.&nbsp; Things are not good right now, and I cannot fathom how people did not see it coming!

				Debbie,<br /><br />Please remember that just because someone is Conservative, has conservative beliefs or anything else, that does not mean they voted for Bush twice or even once.<br /><br />Your blanket disapproval of anyone fitting under this label is just as disgusting, close-minded and ignorant as blanket disapproval of Muslims, gays or any other group.<br /><br />This will be the last time I acknowledge your posts. I don&#039;t like close-minded discussion whether it&#039;s conservative or liberal and I think your posts are as close-minded as many of the other people on this board that I&#039;ve decided to simply ignore rather than allow to goad me into debate.

				A friendly reminder that when the conversation gets personal that I start suspending people (as I have done tonight). It&#039;s not really fun for me, but when intelligent conversation just turns into name calling that&#039;s when this board stops serving its purpose.<br /><br />It seems that nearly every &quot;conservative&quot; &quot;liberal&quot; issue that comes up on this board results in name calling and personal attacks.
