				there's a nice little place on Broadway named Cassidy's.<br />hah! &nbsp; :lol: <br /><br />i know plenty of single guys around here, but i'm no matchmaker. before moving here i often heard of astoria as a place where city people moved after getting married: not as cheap as the suburbs but close enough for jazz. <br />i virtually never leave astoria (or venture more than 10 square blocks from this spot, for that matter) but i wonder if it's still true that people's social lives revolve around their place of work, not their home base. for some reason i've never even contemplated an astoria dating scene... my loss, i'm sure... &nbsp;:cry: <br /><br />anyway, if Cassidy's doesn't work out there's this other place called Kelly's on Crescent. <br />double hah! &nbsp;:lol:

				ehhh. i guess i will admit it was a little insensitive.<br /><br />but maybe i was frustrated at the non-specificness of the question.<br />the original poster mentioned something that she 'was' single, as in past tense, and no longer. &nbsp;<br /><br />so i dont understand what the single men would be used for?<br />focus groups?<br />you need some people to help you landscape?<br />is this for wild sex orgies?<br />are you looking for partners for your single female friends?<br />are you looking for partners for your single gay friends?<br />(if it matters to your group of friends) what age range are you looking for?<br /><br />what the &quot;heckle&quot; does 'groovy single guys' mean? what kind of population are you going for?<br /><br />with that information, maybe you can get somewhere on the forum. <br /><br />'i'm looking for people who are interested in _______, where can i find that?' might be more useful. because if you find a certain population who are interested in something, it will most likely contain men and women who are interested in that topic. and from there, you might find single men within that population. <br /><br />and like sorabji said... we dont know what you mean by 'groovy'. <br /><br />and i think this is what Telesphoros was getting at too----&gt;so, to me, your original post looks like something i would huff and puff about to my girlfriends after a bad date:<br /><br />&quot;ugh! where are all the nice decent guys at?&quot; <br /><br />you are having people over for food and drinks and you want a nice mix of single men and women? well.... i think i saw a post on here about some people wanting to start a dinner group. maybe you might find some single men who are into that kind of activity. <br /><br />but otherwise, i feel that you have a healthy group of friends coming over to your place for food and drinks. &nbsp;a good group of friends doesnt always have a 'perfect' mix.

				i still disagree. <br /><br />i dont think they 'disappear'--- if you are implying that they 'disappear' into marriage, then that would mean that there are equal amounts of men and women 'disappearing'.<br /><br />also need to take into account that we have an openly gay community here in nyc--- i think you were looking for straight men. <br /><br />i dont know what kind of population you are pandering to. and i dont know what kinds of subgroups you belong to. <br /><br />single men can be found in gaming internet places. in sports bars. in billiards clubs. in ratty ass bars. in strip clubs. seedy nite clubs. rock concert venues. hip hop show venues. salsa and latin clubs. and from my experience, they tend to live in more 'sketchier' neighborhoods cuz many arent as picky as i am. and i might be wrong, but i dont think miss jennifer likes to hang out in the above locations.<br /><br />but they can also be found elsewhere, like the freeze peach, like bookstores, like gyms, like poetry clubs, parks, recreational sports teams, coffee shops, ok-looking bars, jazz cafes, artist communes, art galleries, museums, and on and on.<br /><br />also... are you saying that they are disappearing from the Astoria neighborhood? the greater nyc neighborhood? new york? the entire country? <br /><br />i would agree that there might be 'less' of the type of men that you are looking for here in Astoria. (i hate saying this) it is of higher economical status it's gettin kinda expensive to live here than say other parts of queens, upper manhattan, south bronx, inner brooklyn, etc. Astoria is family friendly so it tends to attract married couples w/ kids. <br /><br />also need to take into account the developmental stage of a man in their late 20's. generally speaking, &nbsp;they are probably getting their career started, or already on their way to having a successful career and are probably focusing really hard on that, and may not want to hang out at the above locations as much as females their same age (again, generally speaking, women are socialized to hang out differently). <br /><br />and, btw-- i'm mid 20's going on late 20's and<br /><br />LOVE BEING SINGLE! <br /><br />ROCK ON LADIES!

				so when is the field trip to venezuela?<br /><br />i think it is hard to meet people in nyc. &nbsp;i know lots of cool single women and not so many cool single men (but i don't propose that this ratio carries over into the general population - another fight, another day). &nbsp;<br /><br />think of the single NYCers on a scale of 10 in terms of general desirability (successful, healthy, attractive, well-mannered, isn't getting over a bad breakup, etc). &nbsp;<br /><br />My theory is that the hot models we see wandering the streets have set the bar for all of us - from 1s to 10s. &nbsp;A 7 meets a 7 and thinks &quot;yeah, she's cute and we have a lot in common - but I've got a couple of 8s and 9s in the running&quot; and meanwhile the 8s and 9s are making goo goo eyes at 10s. &nbsp; everyone is competing over a tiny percentage of the population, and everyone keeps thinking that &quot;hey, this is new york, maybe i can do better&quot; and that is why there are so many broken hearts in this damn city. &nbsp; not to mention that what looks like a 10 could be a 5 when you realize that they are deeply in debt and have an abiding passion for reality tv.<br /><br />that's a bit of a departure from the original question, but this is my best theory and i don't really have any ideas about &nbsp;demographics.

				speaking of topless Venezuelans, how did the lapdance club on Steinway and 35th Ave. get in there? across the street from a playground and 4 or 5 blocks from a school. wtf...<br /><br />i am starting to think that this topic of discussion is a bit of a troll. which is kind of disappointing. at any rate, to help prove the 10:1 good friends ratio i would have to have at the very least 20 good friends split evenly on gender lines. if i live forever i do not think i will ever find 20 &quot;good friends&quot; but disregarding the lack of fundamental logic in this discussion i look at my address book and find that it's complicated anyway to say who is single and who is something else. some of my friends have sex partners who (they say) they'd dump if they found the real thing -- are they single? others are in relationships and complain continuously (to me at least) about their situation. sometimes they seem, if not &quot;single&quot; then solitary. others are with a different partner every couple of nights, in abusive relationships, getting divorced, separated (but not legally) -- they are not single. are they? bah, who cares. single, taken, married, spinster -- it's like reducing people to a Myspace profile.

				of course not, but so what? &nbsp;no one is suggesting that you can't have a fine old time with girlfriends, or that a party without a perfect 50-50 ratio is a bust.<br /><br />it's just that ... well, geee...<br /><br />uh....<br /><br />some of us like ... um... you know ... <br /><br />men.<br /><br />there! &nbsp;i said it.<br /><br />they're nice to have around, even when there's no spark in the air. &nbsp;<br /><br />call me a bad feminist, call me dumb, call me shallow, say i'm rank with boy-cooties, but i like spending time with cool guys who have something interesting to say. &nbsp;there's more to male/female relationships than flirtation and romance. &nbsp;and even that stuff is fun, too.

				1) &nbsp;50 - 50 &nbsp;was never the issue. &nbsp;a gathering of mixed sex, single, not single, straight, gay, trans, whatever is much more interesting than a group of couples and single women. &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />2) &nbsp;to show a 10:1 ratio you would only need 11 people not 20.<br /><br />3) cbird you may want to assume the types of places where I hang... that's fine... but watch it - i feel you're close to labeling me a republican... &nbsp;then I'd truly lose it.<br /><br />4) hope you're all having a nice day.

				I sense that we're talking about singles who are recent arrivals rather than Astoria natives. Here's a somewhat simple explanation drawn from my own circle of aquaintance: Astoria strongly appeals to young single females who, like families, are very often looking for affordable apartments in a safe neighborhood with lots of amentities like grocery shops, laundrettes, etc. Young single guys sometimes go for these things too, but they are also often willing to live in rougher places without all these things in exchange for cheaper rent - think Bushwick, Bed-Stuy, East Williamsburg, the South Bronx, etc. I know only two single women who live in those neighborhoods, but I know many in Astoria. I don't know any single men who live in Astoria, but I know many in those neighborhoods. Not a scientific sample, but maybe it's a start. <br /><br />That said, there seem to be no shortage of single men in LIC, so maybe hit a WarmUp at PS1 before the summer ends!

				Wow! A cat fight over the very existence of desirable single men in Astoria!<br />&nbsp;I have to agree to a point made earlier in this thread.....it would appear that EVERYONE.....women included....is shopping for the same 10 percent of the available/unattached population, and moaning the blues when they don't attain them...I guess I could include myself in that group. It is natural if not a bit difficult to admit. Plus the rather large gay male population in this town....remember many came here, not necessarily born here....can have an effect on the &quot;Bell Curve&quot;....sorry ladies....at least there are more guys out there who really do know how to cut your hair.<br />Also, many single guys find that they are called to 'service' for a woman when her lease is up and she needs someone...or somebodies....to carry her things down from a fifth floor walkup.<br />..........the truth can be painful..........

				Jens husband Jonathan here, &nbsp; This has been fun watching the thread grow and grow and go in odd directions. &nbsp;<br /><br />Just a few observations;<br /><br />we have noticed for a while now that the majority of our single friends are female. &nbsp;Many of them are kick ass, smart and beautiful. We ask, where are the men for them, why are they having such a hard time finding good men to be with (for all the catty people, save it, im being general and assuming these ladies dont have serious flaws). &nbsp;<br /><br />I am always being asked by my women friends to keep them in mind for my guy friends. &nbsp;I notice that my single male friends have seriously dwindled over the years. &nbsp;So we wonder about this and Jen wrote about it in here.<br /><br />-yes we know there are gays in nyc, who doesnt know that?<br />-yes astoria is a family neighborhood, but who mentioned astoria as the only place for men?<br />-by the way gaming internet sites are probably not the best place for a woman to find a real man. &nbsp;unless she is 14 to 20. &nbsp;<br />- yes of course you dont need an equal mix of people for an interesting party. but we are not talking about that.<br />-enigmacat obviously gets the point here, someone else doesnt.<br />- besides the cabanird, what other women in here are meeting men at strip bars???<br /><br />Anyway, lets go to venuzuela, go topless, have a drink and celebrate.

				i actually have not stepped into a 'strip club' in my entire life.<br />tho you can catch me at burlesque shows often, join me if you like! (that's for both ladies and men. :) )<br /><br />i still say that your ladies need to be open to different kinds of males as the typical 'perfect' guys are very very hard to find. keep an open mind, and have the ladies do what they truly love and enjoy, and the guys in the right mindset/motivations will come along.

				Actually, this hits upon what I feel is the major problem with dating. It's usually about what someone is getting out of the hookup -- hotter, richer, better, whatever -- rather than what is being brought to a relationship.<br /><br />It's the gimme-gimme zeitgeist that plagues nearly every form of social interaction, especially dating.<br /><br />No surprise then that despite (or maybe because of) the proliferation of matchmaking initiatives -- from 'speed dating' to endless personal ads on every website -- people are still complaing about being single.

				Not at you Tuesday - general observation<br /><br />That was a cool article about Oprah. I was imagining in my mind what would have happend had it been a primarily male audience and Oprah had a group of nicely endowed (financially or physically or emotionally or intellectually) women appear on stage and tell the men that &quot;every body gets a girl,&quot; followed by how they won't mind your beer drinking or sports watching. And especially the &quot;go ahead, touch them, kiss them, they're yours,&quot; part.<br /><br />I have a feeling that her show wouldn't have gotten such good ratings as it's not politically correct to treat women as objects these days.<br /><br />It's strange that Oprah of all people, who demonizes men that see women as objects (perhaps rightly so), would turn around and do the same thing.<br /><br />Oh I almost forgot - it's ok (even sexy or hip) to treat men as objects. (Especially since todays men are simply decendants of a long history of males that abused and objectified women as prizes to be owned. Someone needs to pay for those past atrocities - so might as well be the men alive today! They probably have some of those bad genes still left in them so we better give them some of their own medicine)<br /><br />Or maybe I'm wrong (or going to far) here and I need to re-evaluate the idea of what constitutes treating someone as an object really is. Maybe it's ok to see men as objects to be owned, but I want to understand why that's true if it is. If men and women are indeed equals, as many of us believe, then the &quot;rules&quot; should be the same.<br /><br />It does feel like these days that we've just &quot;leveled the playing field&quot; by doing to men the same thing that men (and women) have done to women through the ages. I don't see that as progress or &quot;justice,&quot; I see it as twice the abuse.

				I feel totally stupid for falling for it. Luckily my blood pressure wasn't up though - I was really interested though in any discussion that might follow. <br /><br />Once I saw the story and the picture I was so excited about the possibility of a great discussion that I didn't even check to see if it was real. Duh.<br /><br />I've been thinking about how men and women are exploited in the media as a result of a class I'm taking. My general feeling is that it looks like men and women are equally exploited in advertisements, sitcoms, print etc. At first I was thinking that it's nice that men are now exploited too, but then I thought &quot;wait, that's not better - what humans want is to not be exploited at all, not just spread the exploitation equally among everyone.&quot; It's like bringing eqality by treating everyone like an animal, instead of fixing the problem and treating everyone like humans.<br /><br />Of course maybe I'm wrong, and it's better to live in a society that exploits human beings for purposes of advertisements, humor, entertainment etc. As rapture said &quot;they all have a choice.&quot; Which is true to a certain extent - some people dont, as in the ones that are desperate for money, or children or whatever. Hmm.. well I'm taking this thread way off topic so I'd better stop now. But the possibility of delving into this with Oprah at the helm was perfect bait for me and I totally fell for it like a moron.

				Hi Merm,<br />I object to one thing you said, the Oprah show does not demonize men. &nbsp;I don't know why men think that. I've heard similar attitudes before and I can only guess it has something to do with the fact she has such a huge female fan base, and that therefore she must be saying something bad about men. <br />She is so popular because she is a very positive and encouraging that people should be their best.<br />&nbsp;The media in general is not a place to look for any uplifting or positive images or projections of people, and she is rare exception to the rule.<br />&nbsp; I don't think that the media equally objectifies men either, it's still hugely slanted towards objecting women, but men are objectified somewhat if what you mean is the proliferation of billboards and underwear ads that kind of thing.

I have watched multiple Oprah shows where she really puts men down. I remember one show in particular where a woman was trying to defend men and Oprah wouldn't let her finish and was saying that she was wrong. I find it unfortunate that a woman with so much influence and power sometimes puts men into roles that they don't necessarily conform to. Granted, I don't watch Oprah often (and we're getting rid of our television soon, so the opportunity to watch her will be even more limited), but a lot of the abuse shows that I have seen are usually about men who abuse women, and not vice-versa, yet women can be just as abusive towards men.<br /><br />I am not saying that Oprah doesn't have some merit, but she often takes it upon herself to be the voice for women everywhere, yet I disagree with a lot of her viewpoints. I guess I am not part of her &quot;huge female fan-base.&quot; (Which I honestly find completely embarrassing - the way women scream when she comes onto her stage makes me think that a lot of women think she is God. It's just a television show people.)<br /><br />Anyway - I just wanted to jump in and say that it isn't just men who feel that way about Oprah, and that I have seen shows where she presents herself as someone who doesn't fully respect men as human beings. I often wonder how her comments affect her personal relationships with men.

				Can you tell me what show that was? I have access to Oprah transcripts at work and I would love to read that. &nbsp;I really don't believe she puts men down. &nbsp;That's not what she's about. &nbsp;And I've seen a lot of Oprah shows! As you said, you don't watch much of her shows because you don't like her. <br />If you remember the gist of the show, I can probably pull it up with a few key words or a date range..

				that's an interesting question about how oprah's personal relationships are.. I have never wondered that about her, though she seems as happy as the next person with her longtime bf Steadman. But I used to wonder how Howard's Sterns marriage could withstand his glowing reflections on women. Oh wait he's divorced his long time wife Alison to be with a 6ft blonde Beth Ostrosky.. Then there's another huge fan of women in general, Rush Limbaugh,, let's see on his third divorce and shacking up with lovely CNN achorwoman Daryn Kagan, I still can't believe that!! lol! &nbsp;There are plenty of 'angry white men' personalities in the media bashing women and nobody thinks it's more than good clean American fun.

				I can't remember the time frame for that particular show I commented on. It could have been within the last couple of years, but it wasn't a recent show. If I could remember more, I would most certainly tell you. I just remember her little exchange with that woman and thinking how awful that was.<br /><br />Anyway, it doesn't really matter if it is Oprah bashing men (which she may or may not do, based upon differing perceptions of her). Just because men or women out there are putting women down doesn't give us the same right to do it back. Somewhere the abuse has to end, and I don't think that it matters who stops it. I think both sexes should try and respect the other and each other.<br /><br />To hear women sit there and say &quot;Men are stupid&quot; or &quot;Men are pigs&quot; and just generalize them into one big heap is really frustrating for me. I have encountered a lot of men in my life that fill the spectrum - some have been complete jerks, while others have been very sensitive and caring. At the same time I have encountered a lot of women in my life that also fill the spectrum - jerks to kind-hearted women.<br /><br />I just think that we owe ourselves and others the respect to judge them by their characters and not by their sex. Just because I am a woman doesn't make me any better than any man out there.

				Especially since that was a spoof - they are certianly not there.<br /><br />I do think that Oprah is unfair to &quot;men&quot; in some of her shows. She may do this because she has a huge female fan base and it's one way that she can identify with her audience. I also see her do many good things, and many good shows, far more positive ones than negative.<br /><br />That being said, that she does far more positive than negative shows, I have been dissapointed at things I've heard her say on her show before that were completely unfair, even stereotypical. One test for me personally is to just reverse the statement or story someone tells/says (or that even I say) and see if saying the same thing would be considered sexist. I have done that and felt that she was going too far in the past.<br /><br />I also just want to point out the &quot;(and perhaps rightly so)&quot; part was genuine. It's clear that there are some people (men and women) that need to be told in direct, clear, confrontational language that they are abusive - I totally support this kind of behavior when it comes from her (or others). It's when then, during follow up comments, after we move out of the story of one person's life, someone makes the shift into stereotypical generalizations about one sex, gender, race or whatever that I object. This is unhelpful and traditional - it is not appropriate in the world we live in today in my opinion no matter which &quot;sex&quot; or &quot;race&quot; or whatever it is directed at.<br /><br />On a side note I want to express my disgust that Howard Stern seems to speak on behalf of all men (or any of the others you mentioned). I can promise you there are large, large, numbers of men that wouldn't be comfortable with him (them) as their spokesperson. Of any person in the media who makes stereotypical and abusive comments Stern fits that role perfectly, as do others that speak for &quot;men&quot; supposedly.<br /><br />Dr. Phil is one person that I personally think doesn't seem to fall into that trap quite as often - yet he also has a huge female fan base. I don't know why I get that from him, but it just seems clear that when he is critical of someone, that he doesn't make the mistake of suggesting that this is typical &quot;female&quot; or &quot;male&quot; behavior etc. <br /><br />Maybe someone disagrees with me on that though.

I don't understand why since I'm personally not finding anywhere in this thread where anyone has actually been intolerant (including yourself). Everyone is expressing opinions here and that's ok by me. Nobody has called for censorship or banishment, nor has anyone said anything about how anyone else is intolerant (except you.) Just because someone has a different opinion than you doesn't automatically make them intolerant. Nor do I even think you are being intolerant by claiming that I (or others) am being intolerant. You can claim that all you want but it doesn't make it automatically so, nor does it make you intolerant just for claiming it. Even if someone really was being intolerant, it doesn't make you intolerant just to bring it up and disagree with that person (although if one didn't control themselves I could see how that could ultimately result in intolerance of the intolerant person.) But in the context of this thread I am unable to see any basis for your claim so I'm going to need your help to undersand your accusation.<br /><br />About the post: I think you're missing something. My comments are being manipulated and misunderstood. I don't think what I said is unreasonable.<br /><br />Howard doesn't speak on behalf of all men as an official &quot;spokesperson.&quot; Nobody is saying that, nor am aware that he has legally &quot;claimed&quot; that. However, as a public media figure Howard does represent a certian stereotype of masculenity in our culture. This is the nature of the media. I think the same is true of other prominant media figures. Nobody &quot;claims&quot; to speak on behalf of anyone, but because of the nature of the media it may indeed &quot;seem&quot; that someone is a spokesperson for a certian group within the population. I object to the representation he makes of what white males in this country are, just as I object to the representation of what George Bush makes an American out to be. If there are people out there (like Tuesday) who actually think that Howard is a representation of masculenity and that we all think it's just &quot;fun&quot; then I want to say &quot;I'm sorry, that's not true,&quot; because I object to that portrayal as well, and don't think it's fun or funny. &nbsp;I don't think this is too radical a statement to imply intolerance or merit its label.<br /><br />Perhaps you can enlighten on these ideas... &nbsp;:?:

				OK, let's see if we can unravel this b/c I think we're communicating at cross purposes.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: merm</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Do you really believe that's what's going on here?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />I see sweeping generalizations in Tuesday's post with little support to back them up.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><em>There are plenty of 'angry white men' personalities in the media bashing women and nobody thinks it's more than good clean American fun.</em></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Does it happen? Sure. But saying &quot;nobody thinks it's more than good clean American fun&quot; is clearly an exaggeration -- no less potent than what you hear on any side, which was my point about intolerance. She expresses disdain for interolant behavior by painting everyone with the same brush. It doesn't work that way.<br /><br />Back to your comment. I didn't see anything &quot;intolerant&quot; with it, I just was not clear as to what you meant. You said &quot;seem&quot; -- to whom? You? Me? The public? Howard's listeners? His sponsors? It's not clear. To me he doesn't seem to speak for all men. I don't believe anyone does.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I object to the representation he makes of what white males in this country are, just as I object to the representation of what George Bush makes an American out to be. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />It's been ages since I've listened to his show, but what exactly is the &quot;representation he makes of what white mails in this country are&quot;? I concede that there are plenty of people who make him a cultural representation of sorts, and I'm pretty sure he encourages it in order to keep his ratings high. <br /><br />But I get what you're saying -- that there are plenty of men who find Howard Stern's brand of &quot;humor&quot; nasty and despicable. I agree. And that many men object to him having this mantle of masculinity. I agree. But let's not give Howard Stern more credit than what he's worth. I think we should look upon those who actually admire him for what he says. They're the ones that make him a representative of some women-hating cabal of frat-boys and knuckleheads. Howard's just an opinionated clown and a ratings whore. His audience, however, makes him a <em>celebrity</em>. The problem isn't with Howard because any other shock-jock could fill his shoes. The problem is in our culture, which ultimately means, within ourselves.<br /><br />So are right-thinking men supposed to repent for Howard, tearing at their beards, renting their garments? I won't. After all, the man's got a right to say what he wants. I'll choose not to listen.

				I think you've just hit on the head exactly what I was trying to say. The main difference is that I think I'm willing to say &quot;I'm sorry, that's not a fair representation of men,&quot; you're saying that you're not going to say your sorry for someone like Howard. I think that's a perfectly valid argument. But, I see no harm either in apologizing to anyone who really thinks that we &quot;men&quot; identify with Howard. This is just my personal approach, though I realize some would say it is weak.<br /><br />I don't mean &quot;sorry&quot; as in that I feel responsible for putting Howard on the air, but as in I'm sorry (along with everyone else) that he is on the air (though I'm not sure I'd move to remove him from it forcefully) and in a position to be a media representation of a subsection of the population.

Even if his show may be of poor quality, he has every right to be on the air as anybody else. If all the shows on television or radio were good quality, that would be great, but unfortunately not extremely balanced. Good and bad, high and low quality all deserve to be on our list of choices. Without this diverse list of choices we would be stuck watching what the people in power or in the majority think are high quality. I guess what I am arguing here is freedom of choice and possibly freedom of speech, which is a little off topic.<br /><br />And I haven't really watched or listened to him very much, but I'd rather do that first before forming an opinion of him - so I'll hold off on discussing the topic of Howard Stern.<br /><br />Some people, though, would say that Southpark is low quality television entertainment and shouldn't be on the air, but I would disagree completely with that because of a couple of things. #1 - It's very funny. And #2 - IMHO, it takes a very satirical look at our society - and many praises/kudos to them for doing that. <br /><br />I am mentioning Southpark because it is a show I have watched quite a bit, so I am better able to discuss something I know more about. <br /><br />Plus, I think you will find that many people watch Howard Stern/Southpark, including your most intelligent and your most unintelligent - which goes back to what you were saying that you don't like how HS represents some men. However, I would argue that his audience/Southpark's audience are both very diverse. Anyway, I am at work, so I had better get back to work. Perhaps I'll continue this thought when I have more time.

RETIREMENT. &nbsp;So, at that point, you no longer have major pre-selected milestones to judge the passing of time... and things start to blend together. &nbsp;I think that's why most people in their mind feel they are about the same age as just before they graduated from college.

				I never thought about it that way before, critter, but it makes amazing sense. &nbsp;a lot of people do say &quot;oh, in my head i'm 20-something&quot;. &nbsp;<br /><br />i wonder if it might also have something to do with the fact that while you're young things are changing so dramatically - your body, your brain, your needs, your wants, your skills. &nbsp;once you hit 20-something it all sort of starts to level out. &nbsp;there's still some fluxuation, but we're pretty much who we are going to be for the rest of our lives, give or take a few lessons learned.<br /><br />what do we mean, exactly, when we say &quot;i feel x age&quot;? &nbsp;does it mean that we haven't changed much since then? &nbsp;that we still want the same things? &nbsp;<br /><br />interesting to think about ....

				ooooh I hate when guys say stuff like, &quot;Stop looking for the tall, dark, handsome, rich guys and you&#39;ll be fine!&quot; <br /><br />Most recently tried dating a shorter-than-average, broke, older acquaintance I&#39;ve know for a while, with whom I have a lot in common. Sure enough, he&#39;s playing some pretty annoying games already and seems to be a wolf in sheep&#39;s clothing.<br /><br />The worst are the guys who SEEM nice and humble.......and then dump you within a few weeks. Totally out of left field.<br /><br />Also the guys who don&#39;t really strike your fancy, but your friends say, &quot;Stop being picky!!&quot; So you go out for lunch and the next thing you know, you&#39;re switching to an unlisted number and contemplating a gun license.<br /><br />If I need to lower my standards any further, it&#39;ll mean contacting guys as they get sprung from Rikers.<br /><br />Seriously, though, it&#39;s better to be single and alone than in a relationship and lonely. I&#39;m pleased to live in a time where I&#39;m not *expected* to get married (well......not counting my aunts and parents!) No doubt my own issues get in the way, too.<br /><br />Luckily I love cats, which oughta help me in my spinsterhood. :roll:

				I found a single man on the street today. He didn&#39;t fit in my pocket, though. Sorry single women who are looking.<br /><br />Perhaps the fact the men tend to be the predators in relationships might be one reason there are less single men to be found. If they are always looking and being aggressive, they will nearly always be in relationships. I have never known a woman who makes a habit of seeking out men to date (internet not included).<br /><br />Therefore, while the alpha male selects his mate from amongst the dispersed herd, the female is left waiting. Always waiting ... alas.

				Hey - rather than speculate on this, I just thought I&#039;d chime in.<br />I&#039;m new to the area and even newer to this message board and never thought there&#039;d be so much activity to follow my little post. It should be obvious that I had some free time (the photo &amp; the gmail account) and thought to point out that some of us guys have just as hard of a time finding you girls as you have finding us and the internet (and maybe this board) can serve as a way to bridge that communication/connection gap.<br />My post can&#039;t be called modest, humble, or even successful (yet!) but in my experience, the confident and cocky guys are the ones that find the girls. And posts displaying those characteristics get talked about more. <br />For more on my perspectives on this side of the gender barrier, you can read the columns I used to write for my college newspaper here: http://blog.myspace.com/peterwknox<br />Otherwise maybe I&#039;ll just move to Brooklyn.<br />&nbsp;:wink:

				Just for laughs and giggles. Perhaps a short list of exactly WHAT the ladies are looking for. <br /><br />Yeah, yeah...tall, dark &amp; handsome, rich....teeth...( I think that may be more of an issue as you leave the metropolitan area...)<br /><br />But besides the obvious: Heterosexual, not living in the basement of the parents house...not married and lying about it....WHAT do you REALLY want.<br /><br />It&#039;s a fair question, and not that easy to answer if you&#039;re going to think about it and be honest.

				A guy could be tall, dark, and handsome, and still be a jerk.&nbsp; Sometimes all it takes is an ugly personality to make that person ugly inside and out.&nbsp; How someone treats you is a big one.&nbsp; How they treat their mother is a big one.&nbsp; &nbsp;Things I look for - honesty, humility, open mind, and a true enjoyment of life, a hunger for learning of other culture&#039;s, food, and places, a sense of humor, creativity, compassion, a cute smile, and I have to admit, it&#039;s always that well defined arm on display that will turn my head.&nbsp; A smart independent man who appreciates the same in a woman.&nbsp; Yes, if you live in your parent&#039;s house, don&#039;t lie about it.&nbsp; And not mentioned often - but very important - hygiene.&nbsp; Shower and take care of your body on a regular basis.&nbsp; Get haircuts or at least take care of it, trim that beard or shave, know how to buy your own clothes and clean your apartment.&nbsp; Big turnoffs to me tend to be in the form of homophobia, bigotry, and machismo. <br /><br />I would assume men would want similar things.&nbsp; Doesn&#039;t seem hard, but you&#039;d be surprised :)&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Oh, and my opinion - there are tons of cute guys here.<br /><br />

				What do women look for? I guess that depends on the woman! Seriously, when I was on the block, I wanted: makes me laugh, sincere, independent thinking, ambitious (as in, will do more than just get a beer during commercial breaks), active (wants to play more than watch) and a good looker. But for every woman who wants X, there&#039;s going to be one who wants Y and B, maybe you&#039;ll be the C and Z to match, maybe people should just forget about pleasing each other, be who they are and date like rabbits. Glad I&#039;m off the block, because it does seem hard to meet guys post-school.

				(Bear in mind that I mean the following as constructive criticism) FearNLoathing, if you&#039;re looking to meet women, perhaps you shouldn&#039;t link to articles you&#039;ve written that highlight sexist, outdated, stereotyped views of men and women and the interactions between them. Not all women act the way you describe, and the sooner you realize that and stop behaving as such, the sooner your dating prospects should dramatically increase. Those articles don&#039;t present you in a very flattering light, and they might give someone the wrong impression about you.<br /><br />As for the general question of what women look for in a guy (based on personal experience): yes, machismo is a huge turnoff, as is any sign of a huge ego that constantly needs boosting/stroking. The cocky and confident act gets annoying, if not downright creepy, real fast. No one wants a guy who comes on too strong and feels the need to assert control all the time. A guy should not be narcissistic or spend too much time on his appearance or be blatantly insecure, because there&#039;s nothing less sexy than a guy who feels the need to overcompensate.<br /><br />A guy should be considerate and respectful, which in my book means he treats the woman as an equal rather than setting her on a pedestal. He respects her opinions and listens to her concerns, and sees her as an individual rather than treating her simply as part of the monolithic group known as &quot;female&quot;. He doesn&#039;t have a problem with her being independent and making her own decisions. He has some interest in and pays attention to current events and politics, and can hold an intelligent conversation (and is at least open-minded about these views, if not like-minded). He enjoys going outdoors, trying new things, and being physically active, instead of sitting on the couch all day. Sense of humor and a passion about some kind of interest (such as history, music, or computers) is a huge plus. Also, he can still be living at home but he needs to have motivation in life--at least some idea of what he wants to do--and if he&#039;s not happy with his job, then at least he should have some plan for his future.

				I like this part a lot and really feel that this is the way everyone should treat each other regardless of sex or race. There are a lot of ways that both sexes (and this goes for cultures too) force the other into roles that are completely arbitrary (but accepted by society none the less). I really hope that one day humans will truly be able see each other first as individuals and not by what anatomy they were randomly assigned at birth. IMHO the easiest people to start relationships with (friendships or otherwise) are those who aren&#039;t bipolar when it comes to gender, but are willing to create something unique.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=582.msg75934#msg75934">Quote from: euterpe on June 06, 2007, 10:43:53 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">A guy should be considerate and respectful, which in my book means he treats the woman as an equal rather than setting her on a pedestal.
