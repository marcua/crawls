				Wish we were as fortunate... On Tuesday, we received our NY state return FROM 2007!!!!!&nbsp; Yep, we have been trying to get answers about that for months and months and were told that if it really is that important to us, we might have to talk to a lawyer about it. We thought it was never to be seen and then it arrived last week. WEIRD. <br /><br />Filing 2008 today, wondering if we will get it next March.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-o

				I also filed using Turbo Tax in mid-February and got my refund about two weeks later, via direct deposit. Good luck lizluv43!<br /><br />And that totally sucks hayleyree -- maybe you should contact an attorney... it&#039;s not like you&#039;re trying to bilk the state out of money, you just want what&#039;s yours in a prompt and efficient manner.

				I also used taxact.com to eFile both my fed and state.&nbsp; Received my federal in a matter of days and just received my state refund yesterday, 14 days later than the federal. Both were sent via Direct Depsoit.&nbsp; Not sure if that&#039;s the norm, but maybe it&#039;ll help somebody.<br /><br />Just out of curiousity I checked prior years.<br /><br />In 2007 I actually received the federal and tax refunds on the same day.<br />In 2008 I received the NY state refund 6 days after federal.<br />This year, it was 14 days.&nbsp; <br /><br />Then again, maybe I&#039;m just making things too complicated for them these days.

				I just checked for a second time on the state&#039;s website. I mailed my returns on Monday, 2/9.<br /><br />Turns out that both my state and federal refund checks are being mailed&nbsp; out tomorrow, 3/13. <br />I think this is the quickest I&#039;ve ever seen the state check processed. Usually I get it a few weeks<br />after the federal. Too bad it&#039;s all going towards lowering a credit card bill....<br /><br />

				I just got my state refund and I filled the first week of February!!!!!&nbsp; And that&#039;s why with a great heaviness in my heart I&#039;m leaving the city and moving upstate.&nbsp; Can&#039;t take it here anymore, not Astoria just the City and all the inconsideration towards it&#039;s residents but my son is staying in Astoria (my 24 year old) and I&#039;ll still be working in the City so I&#039;ll still be around, afterall Astoria has been my home all my life.

				Oh no, I&#039;m sorry if it came out that way.&nbsp; The refund situation affects the whole state not just the City.&nbsp; What I meant to say is that when you add that to everything else we&#039;re putting up with...it adds up.&nbsp; It takes me an hour to get to my job each day and we&#039;re right next to Manhattan.&nbsp; For those that live close to the train that may not be the case but when you have to take a bus to get to the station(s) and those buses are not on time and they come two at a time.&nbsp; You have the police officers that give out senseless parking tickets that in most cases when you go to court it&#039;s dismissed because there was no sign or because it was 2 minutes before alternate parking starts.&nbsp; I had to go to court 3 times this month alone with tickets that had the time 11:27 when alternate parking here starts at 11:30...if I don&#039;t go then I have to pay the tickets.&nbsp; My son had the car towed because he parked where it said no parking from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. but no where on the sign did it say towing zone nor was there any sign that said towing zone or that your park will be towed...zilch.&nbsp; It&#039;s those small things that just add up.&nbsp; The trains into Queens, every other day there&#039;s a problem (lex &amp; 53rd station) for the past two days I had to take the E downtown to 34th just to switch to the N...and it&#039;s only getting worse.&nbsp; I know that wherever I am in the state of New York I&#039;ll be affected but not as much as the city.
