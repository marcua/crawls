				OK so......<br /><br />I bought my BF a wall mount for our flat screen TV. The installation seems fairly simple, but we are at odds about the wires. <br /><br />I really want to put the wires into the wall to have that &quot;floating&quot; illusion - why else would be put it on the wall in the first place? <br /><br />He doesn&#039;t want to do that and thinks that because we have plaster walls, it won&#039;t be easy/possible. <br /><br />Has anyone mounted their flat screen TVs and hid the wires in the wall in a pre-war, plaster-walled apartment? How big does the hole for the wires really need to be? Is is difficult?<br /><br />All advice would be appreciated!<br /><br />Jess

				I have plaster walls and also had the same worry but PC Richard installed our flat screen beautifully. Just have to make sure the wires have enough room inside the wall (especially if you have a lot of things connected to the tv). So, yes, you can do it!

I don&#039;t know why you would run <em>that</em> many wires unless you really had to. He should have (but didn&#039;t, as far as I could tell) point out that any cabling run through the walls has to be up to fire code.

				Even at a lower resolution, an HDMI cable has the potential to deliver the sharpest, clearest picture of any of the choices for home video stuff. If the source and the display both have HDMI connectors, it&#039;s what I would choose.

				<br /><br />i think metal studs should do the job, just try to re-inforce it........... but as long as you get the right bracket / mount for 52&#039;&#039; you will be fine.....youtube and google will also give you better answers

				<br /><br />i have not done a 52&#039;&#039;, only a 32&#039;&#039;<br /><br />IMO, if the studs seem too shaky and flimsy dont do, play it safe with a nice stand<br /><br /><br /><br />

				All you have to do is get yourself a stud finder, locate the metal studs, get some toggle bolts (http://stores.steelworksstore.com/catalog/toggle.gif) with washers, affix the lcd mount to the wall with the toggle bolts, mount the tv and you&#039;re done. It will hold. If you&#039;re not sure you&#039;ll trust a few toggle bolts, then mount a piece of 1/2&quot; plywood, then the tv mount on top of that and then the lcd. Trust me, it&#039;ll hold. I&#039;ve done it hundreds of times.

				Thanks for the input guys , i finally got it all done last night . i used 4 -5inch toggle bolts&nbsp; and&nbsp; 4 wall anchor screws into the drywall said to hold 50lbs each(which they prob dont ,but im sure they will help). guess the thing that got me nervous was the total weight of the tv with the bracket which is 89lbs plus around 25lbs equaling 114lbs going into metal studs . i was lucky enough that i was able to get behind the wall i was mounting on and remove a center piece of sheetrock . that way i made sure the toggles went right thru the center of the stud. i also was able to do all my wiring thru that opening as i also installed a home theater in a box system 5.1 . my xbox 360 sounds amazing as well . since i was able to get in back of the mounting wall , which is actually my boiler room wall , i had 2 sets of metal studs parallel&nbsp; next to each other to work with .&nbsp; one stud held the outer sheetrock and the other the inner sheet rock which was the inside of the boiler room .&nbsp; i got the 5 inch toggler so that i would go thru both sets .&nbsp; &nbsp;that made me feel alot more secure/
