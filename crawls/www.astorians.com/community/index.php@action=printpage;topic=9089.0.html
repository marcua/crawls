				It seems that in the so-called court of public opinion, Roger Clemens is guilty of steriod use.&nbsp; After watching/hearing all his recent interviews and conferences, do you believe that he never has used performance enhancing drugs?

				Like I&#039;ve said elsewhere, the problem is that Clemens was put into a position where if he admits any use, he basically has to admit that his trainer jabbed him in the butt with the stuff all the time. He can&#039;t get off like Pettite and say &quot;I did it once, it was a mistake, I&#039;ll never do it again.&quot; However, unlike some other athletes, Clemens hasn&#039;t bulked up considerably--he has gained weight, but that could just as easily be attributed to aging, especially considering where the weight sits--and the man claiming his involvement is facing criminal charges. There certainly is reason to want to point the finger at a big figure.<br /><br />That being said, I find it hard to believe that Clemens never did them. I almost think that it&#039;s the kind of thing that almost every player has probably tried at some point. The real question is whether or not he used them as extensively as the claims say. I don&#039;t know. I hope that he didn&#039;t. I like Clemens and would like to see him come out on top in this, but I don&#039;t think I would be surprised either way.

				I think that he juiced somewhere between Boston and New York, and likely in New York and Boston.&nbsp; He was playing in an era where the Jose Cansecos and Mark McGuires had lots of access to this stuff, and in turn he was likely exposed to this earlier.&nbsp; The issue is that they&#039;ve only focused on two guys, who were around late in Clemens&#039; career, and I imagine with more digging you&#039;d see more people coming out calling Clemen&#039;s a juicer.&nbsp; <br />With all that said, the fact that Clemen&#039;s hasn&#039;t showed the physical breakdown and recurring injury that is typically associated with a steroid user, I think that there is a slight shadow of a doubt, slight.&nbsp; I&#039;m really surprised that he&#039;s willing to testify under oath that he didn&#039;t juice, as he could end up in the same boat as Bonds.

				considering how much tax payer money goes to the construction of new stadiums for these &quot;private&quot; entities, I think congress / state legislators / the public has every right to question, hold hearings, etc.&nbsp; If a company takes public money they have to face the scrutiny of the public.

				Nope.&nbsp; Doesn&#039;t look good for Clemens, but at this point, what other choice does he have other than to deny, deny, deny?&nbsp; They&#039;d have to prove that he lied and it&#039;s his word against McNamee.<br /><br />Oh well........... on the good news front, pitchers and catchers report soon!

				I think he&#039;s guilty as sin and should &quot;misremember&quot; that he denied everything previously.<br /><br />I also agree that the Congress of the Free World should have something a little more important to sweat than whether Roger Clemens bled through his designer pants because he had someone stick a needle in his rear so he can keep his old a$$ in baseball.<br /><br />I love sports and do think that steroids are mauling them, but I don&#039;t really care so much that I think that Congress should be spending its time, money, or energy on it when we&#039;ve got a war going on, an economy falling apart, and a president that has admitted to breaking laws that keep him from spying on my phone calls.<br /><br />Just my .02
