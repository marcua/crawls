				Heya Astorians,<br /><br />I will be moving with my family (spouse + kid) to NYC sometimes next month from Houston, TX. My office is in Manhattan. Looks like Asotria is one of the possible option where I cld stay.<br /><br />Any idea abt a 2 bed apartment rent? Which part of Astoria shld I stay in. My job requires me to commute early or late at night so, I would prefer a decent locality.<br /><br />Any help is very much appreciated!<br /><br />Thanks!

				Welcome, iLusion!&nbsp; There&#39;s a sticky in the &quot;apartments&quot; board that has a lot of info and collective wisdom regarding real estate in Astoria: http://www.astorians.com/index.php?topic=2913.0.&nbsp; This should give you a good start.<br /><br />The basic advice would be to try to be situated near one of the train stations, which will make your commute much easier.&nbsp; Some forum members with children might have specific advice for family resources in Astoria.&nbsp; Lastly, $1400-1600/month would be the range for a 2 bedroom.

				Where in Manhattan is your office?&nbsp; The trainlines that run near your office could give you a sense of whether you want to be near the N, or the R/E/V in Astoria.

				As a mother who&#39;s lived in Astoria for 4 yrs. I felt it my duty to let you know the scoop of what&#39;s going on for kids in Astoria. Not to mention I&#39;ve got family in Houston so your post caught my eye. I would recommend you be near Astoria park. There&#39;s is lots going on there for kids; pool, tennis, soccer, track and a great playground. This means you&#39;d want to be on the N/W train, near Ditmars Blvd. station or Astoria Blvd. station. This means you want to be north of 30th Ave &amp; west of 36th Street. There are several parents groups in Astoria. They are easy enough to find. Good luck and welcome!
