				Goodwill, by the Steinway St. subway station. <br />Reason: Paperback books downstairs are $1 and they always have authors/subjects I like. <br />

				I like the one on 41st St. and Broadway.&nbsp; They always have 2 tables full of used books outside, and that&#039;s why I like it.&nbsp; I go by there to buy new books every now and then, and I also also donate back the books I have already read to them.&nbsp; <br /><br />I wasn&#039;t aware that Goodwill had books as well, but I&#039;ll definitely have to check it out.

				We&#039;ve been bringing tons of decent stuff to the one on Ditmars near 31st. They&#039;ve re-done it so it&#039;s not so bad inside. <br /><br />Don&#039;t know if it&#039;s the best- I&#039;ve heard that the women who work there pick through stuff for themselves, and although I&#039;ve never witnessed such a thing, it&#039;s odd how a lot of nice items never seem to show up on the shelves....!

				It&#039;s not really a &quot;thrift&quot; shop per se, but Famous Brands down in the Best Yet plaza has lots of seriously marked down -- but new-- clothes (mostly NY &amp; Co &amp; some of the Macy&#039;s house brands).&nbsp; It&#039;s a great place to stock up on seasonal stuff.&nbsp;
