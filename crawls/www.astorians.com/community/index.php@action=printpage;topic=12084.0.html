				So me and my man have finally moved and are starting to get settled in, but last night, as we were screwing together a futon, we ran into a problem: we don&#039;t know who delivers to us!<br /><br />We live on 28th Ave off Crescent St and ordered a pie from John&#039;s Pizzeria on Astoria Blvd and Crescent, but I know there have been a million awesome places mentioned on this board that are probably now in our delivery range!<br /><br />Can anyone recommend good places for delivery in our new area? Especially if anyone knows of a good Thai and a good gyro/schwarma place that will come to our door.<br /><br />Thanks!

				Para, you are not far from some very good Thai places on 30th Ave.&nbsp; I would imagine that Zabb Thai and Thai Pavillion would deliver to you.&nbsp; Leng Thai on Broadway bet 33 and 34th streets would also probably deliver to you.

				A great gyro place near you is BZ Grill, on Astoria Blvd. and 27th Street.&nbsp; They deliver and they are among the best in Astoria in my opinion.<br /><br />http://www.bzgrill.com

				I&#039;m not sure why you&#039;re thinking about take-out while you&#039;re screwing together on a futon, but when you&#039;re tired of pizza, Thai and gyro/shwarmas, you may want to try ordering Asian fusion from JJ&#039;s and Italian sandwiches from Il Bambino.&nbsp; They may be on the periphery of your delivery range but I would think they&#039;d make the trip.

				Angelo and Sons Bakery started making sandwiches not too long ago.&nbsp; &nbsp;Better than average too and I believe they deliver with a minimum.

				I also read it as screwing on a futon, but Zabb Thai is good, I believe that Seva Indian would deliver to you and I have to be the bearer of bad news but no soup at Il Bambino until it gets colder.&nbsp; They still have eff-loads of delicious grub there without the soup.
