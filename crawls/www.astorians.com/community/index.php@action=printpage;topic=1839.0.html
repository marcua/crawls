				My jaw dropped when I read about this.&nbsp; Sounds so unreal.<br />-------------------<br />Hanks in &#39;Starbucks&#39; brew<br /><br />28 March 2006 (The Hollywood Reporter)<br />Tom Hanks sure likes his triple venti latte. The actor is attached to star in <em>How Starbucks Saved My Life</em>, a nonfiction book proposal by Michael Gates Gill that was sold to Universal. Gus Van Sant is in negotiations to direct. Hanks will produce with Playtone partner Gary Goetzman. The story centers on an older ad exec who loses his job and family and has to go to work at Starbucks to pay the bills. He befriends the young manager and learns about life and love.<br />-------------------------<br />So Starbucks will pay his 20M salary, most likely.&nbsp; The price will go up again.&nbsp; Glad that I&#39;m a Peach regular.<br /><br />Talking about product placement.&nbsp; Usually product placement is done in somewhat subtle manner but this one is way more blatantly obvious than <em>I Am Sam</em>, where Starbucks was used as a part of the storyline.&nbsp; (Sean Penn&#39;s character worked for Starbucks)

				How about a film where the director and lead actor , uses everyone around him and finds himself<br />trying to explain..why he might look like a real person , but is just a empty headed 1/2 pint.<br /><br />We could set it in your regular place&nbsp; ( oh by the eay do you have a tab there?) , then ask say <br />different law firms to sponsor it and pay everyone ( lord knows the actor /director won&#39;t) <br />and maybe we could even get one of the big video game makers to market it , <br /><br />I can see it now.... A little Rat, running from mobs of extra&#39;s while trying to keep his<br />ego ...<br /><br />Extra points for avoiding&nbsp; bounced checks and 1/2 assed excuses...<br /><br />Or we could have it look like a movie set, with everyone looking around until<br /><br />BINGO.... Here&#39;s the 1/2 pint .....<br /><br />Nick, I&#39;d be happy to work on this one .....<br />

				Wow Just Me - that was really uncalled for. Based upon the other thread you started I thought that you were going to leave this person unnamed, but you are basically outing him right here.<br /><br />It sounds like you were planning on taking legal action, and if so, I don&#39;t think that flaming board posts will be in your favor. Maybe it won&#39;t matter in your legal dispute, but if I were you I might try to be a little more diplomatic in my approach - if not for the other party, for the sake of your reputation in the community.

				I honestly don&#39;t know what everyone has against Starbucks.&nbsp; I used to work for them in the late 90&#39;s and it wasn&#39;t that bad of a job.&nbsp; How many companies will give healthcare for part time employees.&nbsp; The job actually helped to build up my self esteem and work skills.&nbsp; A lot of what I know now for my job I learned from Starbucks.<br /><br />I know, I know...everyone thinks of them like Mc Donalds because they are on every block.&nbsp; But did you ever think why that is.&nbsp; First off, their product isn&#39;t as bad as McDonald&#39;s is. (This is a whole other discussion I think).&nbsp; Second, they give back quite a bit to the communities.&nbsp; And does anyone know anything about Howard Schultz, they guy that made Starbucks a household name.&nbsp; He came from a poor working class family from Canarsie Brooklyn.&nbsp; He grew up in the projects.&nbsp; It isn&#39;t like some rich guy did all this for money.&nbsp; When he started running Starbucks he did it for the love of coffee.<br /><br />I know Starbucks has lost site of what they stand for over the years, but over all, they aren&#39;t a bad company.&nbsp; I know some people might not like their coffee and that is fine.&nbsp; I know some won&#39;t like the company and that is fine also.&nbsp; But before anyone &quot;bashes&quot; something, find out a little about it first.<br /><br />....Just my 2 cents.&nbsp; &nbsp;I can&#39;t wait to get the feedback from this.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)

And they do treat their employees very well - I&#39;ve worked for several big retail companies (and my sister has as well, so she has expierences to compare Sbucks to), and from what she&#39;s told me, its a great place to work.<br /><br />I don&#39;t go often because it could add up, but every time I&#39;ve gone into any Starbucks, they&#39;ve been nice, and whatever I got is tasty. How can you go wrong with that? And once when I went, they were out of one of the ingredients needed for my original drink order so I got something else, and a manager came over a few minutes later (I was sitting waiting to meet someone) and gave me a coupon for a free drink and apologized that they couldn&#39;t make my original order. I didn&#39;t even complain - I was like, &quot;Oh...oh well, I guess I&#39;ll have [something else] instead.&quot; Now that&#39;s customer service!<br /><br />Yeah, they&#39;re pricey, and yeah, they&#39;re a big company, but I don&#39;t think either of those alone is a reason to dislike them.<br /><br />Also, if no one has ever tried it - the Passion tea Lemonade is an AWESOME warm day drink. Just get it unsweetened, the sweetener is too much, there&#39;s enough sugar in the lemonade :)

				When I was in college, we planned a big protest when the first Starbucks opened on campus. Seems like a very quaint idea now!<br /><br />Is there still a lot of Starbucks hatred? For me it&#39;s more of a general annoyance at how ubiquitous they are than anything else. They sound like they&#39;re a good company to work for, though, and good to their employees. <br /><br />I agree their regular coffee is terrible, their fancy drinks are too expensive for anything but a treat, and I would go somewhere else to hang out and read - but I don&#39;t particularly have a problem otherwise.

				mcw - to get to Freeze Peach from your neck of the woods (and mine, as it turns out - sort of), you&#39;d have to get the N train to Ditmars Blvd.&nbsp; Walk west (I think it&#39;s west) along Ditmars a couple blocks to 29th Street, turn left on 29th, and it&#39;s right there, a small, sweet little place with chairs outside and the nicest baristas ever.&nbsp; The java is glorious, but they blend up a lovely tea, as well.&nbsp; Let us know what you think of it!

				Apparently, Starbucks&#39; original sizes were &quot;short&quot; and &quot;tall.&quot; I read an article about this. Short was 8 ounces; I guess they changed this as part of the overall super-sizing trend, before they expanded so much. So, their weird names (or at least why &quot;tall&quot; is the smallest size) make a little sense. <br /><br />You can still order a short size of any of their drinks - it&#39;s just not advertised. I&#39;ve ordered it several times and they all know what you&#39;re talking about. Some of the drinks taste better smaller. <br /><br />

But while the effect of starbucks has been the eradication of smaller local coffee shops in some communities, starbucks was a leader in providing healthcare for its workers in the world of baristas.&nbsp; Also, no one mentioned it yet but unlike Seattle&#39;s Best and Dunkin&#39; Donughts, Starbucks carries Fair Trade Coffee (albeit you have to request it). In regard to brand and its effect on our lives as consumers, I would be interested to know to what degree starbucks pushed or changed coffee consumption, because it certainly carries power in our market. <br /><br />In any case, I respect your choice to purchase local. It&#39;s certainly something I think a lot of Astorians are concious of...

				I was at Starbucks the other day ordering an iced coffee.&nbsp; I started by ordering a small iced coffee but wanted a bigger one.&nbsp; They accomodated me and started to make a larger one.&nbsp; Get this;&nbsp; They fill the coffee to the same line down low in the cup and just use a bigger ice scoop.&nbsp; So same coffee amount and just more ice for more money.&nbsp; Thats awesome, well for them anyway.&nbsp; She did say that the coffee was extra strong so as it dilutes it stays tasty but its still a small amount of coffee for more money.&nbsp; She just looked at me like I didnt get that as it dilutes I still have good coffee.&nbsp; Yes Im lame and still bought the small one.&nbsp; <br /><br />That pumpkin spice chai latte for like 6 bucks looks awesome.&nbsp; Got I hate them and the power they hold over me.

				Meg, take a pumpkin spice pie with lots of aromatic spices like cinnamon, allspice and clove mix it with chai tea and creamy goodness and leave out the pie shell. Heat and put in a cup.&nbsp; Make sure you a near a bench in the park so that you dont waste any of those calories on walking.&nbsp; Ive only had one once 2 yrs ago and i&#39;ll never forget it.&nbsp;
