			Not an Astoria question I know, but do you have any recommendations for suites (hotels) in the 34th/Time Square/Theater District part of the world? &nbsp;Family of friends coming to visit and they need a kitchen and want to be in the middle of it all....<br /><br />thanks,<br />jayme

			I&#039;ve been able to find good deals on www.hotwire.com before right in that area. I was able to book the Sheratan one time for $70/night.<br /><br />Also, have you considered searching for short-term sublets/guest rooms on http://newyork.craigslist.org
