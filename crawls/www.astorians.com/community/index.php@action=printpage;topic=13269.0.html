				I&#039;m wondering if anyone can suggest a bank to obtain a loan?<br /><br />I charged up way too many credit cards during grad school...&nbsp; I have 4, I think with a combined balance around $15K.&nbsp; I keep paying off large chunks and then charging them back up...&nbsp; I think I need to just pay them all off, cut them up and stop using credit cards for basic expenses like food.&nbsp; And stop shopping so much!<br /><br />Any suggestions on where I should go for the lowest interest rate?&nbsp; I have good credit (besides my debt, I do always pay all my bills on time) and a decent salary.&nbsp; The last time I took out a loan was a car loan 6 years ago.&nbsp; I have no idea what the process is for this.&nbsp; I can just go into the bank and sit down and talk to someone?&nbsp; What do I need to bring with me?&nbsp; Do they pay the credit card companies directly, or do they give me money to pay them with?&nbsp; Is it a better idea to go to the bank where my checking account is (HSBC)?

				The best bet is to cut up your cards now and not later . Dont delay or make excuses , just cut them up . Keep making those payments in large chunks however best u can . If u can get yourself to stop spending on shopping like u said ,it would be a very smart thing . Keep reminding yourself u have to cut corners in order to stop allowing these credit companies to leech off of u with this interest they thrive on .Y do u allow them to win &gt;? Their goal is for u to spend and not relize whats left in your pocket and in the end only pay the min every month while charging more and more . The more interest the better , for them , not for you . So dont allow them to get what they want .&nbsp; Rip them up now !!!<br /><br />One great thing u can do is get a card that will give u&nbsp; cash upfront with no interest for a year or maybe more . I bought a bedroom set and did it that way&nbsp; since the store would charge me interest if i was to finance the set . U can google which cars offer this , or many times they send offers in the mail . Remember u would still have to make monthly min&#039;s&nbsp; every time or then u pay a huge penalty , thats the kicker here . If u pay everytime , like u say u do , this might help u .&nbsp; &nbsp;I did something like this once for a downpayment on a house&nbsp; and i got out&nbsp; 58k from bank of america with zero interest for&nbsp; a year . Instead of applying for a loan which was like 14% i didnt pay a penny interest and eventually paid it off before the year was over .&nbsp; Even if i couldnt pay it off , i wouldve applied for another card&nbsp; as the year was ending to cover the remaining balance with the same type of no interest deal /

				When I got serious about paying off my credit card debt (way higher than yours, incidentally), I made up an Excel spreadsheet that listed the balance of each in one column, a blank column for monthly payments, and a third column with my checking account balance in another.&nbsp; I hid all the cards away (you can cut them up, but closing the accounts hurts your credit score) and started carrying and using ONLY my debit card for purchases.&nbsp; I focused on one card at a time (on the others I would pay more than the minimum, but something like $100 or $200), starting with the card with the highest balance (even though it wasn&#039;t the highest interest rate, it was the highest interest charge every month).&nbsp; For whatever card I focused on, I paid the absolute maximum I could afford every month.&nbsp; I was able to pay off my entire credit card debt in 12 months doing this.<br /><br />It does take discipline, but it works.&nbsp; Right now credit is extremely tight - I don&#039;t know how available bank loans are right now.&nbsp; Personally, instead of messing with yet another line of credit, I&#039;d recommend something like the above, especially if you don&#039;t need to consolidate for financial reasons.

				Thank you for all the advice,but seriously--I know!&nbsp; I have a CPA and a Series 7 license, so I guess I&#039;m supposed to be some kind of financial expert, haha.&nbsp; I fully acknowledge that I behaved irresponsibly and need to practice some self-control.&nbsp; <br /><br />While some good points have been made about how to pay down your debt and be organized, all I&#039;m asking for here is some advice on where to go for a loan... any suggestions?&nbsp; I know that credit is tight these days, but I think I&#039;m a pretty safe bet for a bank.&nbsp; I have good credit history, have NEVER made a late payment and have a good, stable job (yes, the economy sucks--but they still need accountants!).&nbsp; The credit card companies love me because I always pay them, yet always keep a large balance and they&#039;re making tons in interest from me... bank interest rates aren&#039;t as bad, and maybe the banks will see that they can make money off of me instead of the credit card companies.

				I would check out the personal loan&#039;s interest rate, it might be more than your credit card&#039;s rate.<br /><br />Do you get any of those offers for 0% cards? You can open an account and transfer all of your balances there and won&#039;t have any interest on them while you pay them off.<br /><br />Another option would be to look through your cards and find the one with the lowst rate and transfer all your other balances there. You can even call the credit card company to lower your rate, most will do that if you pay on time.<br /><br />I recently became debt-free from credit cards. I did this by NOT going shopping and transferred all my balances to the card with the lowest interest rate.

				Check into borrowing against your company 401k- Rates are usually 1pt above prime and they take it right out of your check. If you have enough, you won&#039;t get turned down if you have enough in there to cover. Choose your term length. Usually a $50 fee though, but that can be plopped onto the loan.

The whole process was very easy-- I brought all of my statements to the bank, sat down with the bank guy and answered some questions. Then he was able to tell me what kind of loan amount and interest rate I could get-- and even worked with me to see how we could get the best deal. In some cases, if you agree to close certain credit card accounts on the spot, they can get you a better interest rate deal for the loan-- because it is unfavorable in their eyes for you to still have all of that credit available to you after they clear it out and put it on the loan. <br /><br />I got a loan that covered paying off everything, so now I&#039;ve just got one lump payment each month (which turns out to be less than I had to pay to cover all of the different cards before). The interest rate I got wasn&#039;t the greatest, but at least it&#039;s less than what the credit cards were charging me.<br /><br />The bank did all the work for me-- contacted all of my credit cards and sent the payment in and everything. So all I had to deal with was any tiny leftover interest amounts on my next credit card statements (a word of advice-- slightly overpay your credit card balances, that&#039;s the only way to zero them out in one billing period-- they&#039;ll mail you a check back for the overage). I only use ONE credit card now, as sparingly as possible (my HSBC Mastercard, which has the lowest credit limit of all my previous cards, to force myself to limit using it).<br /><br />For what it&#039;s worth, the folks at the Union Square HSBC branch were extremely nice and helpful. And trust me, however self-conscious you may feel about the amount of your debts, they&#039;ve seen much worse :)
