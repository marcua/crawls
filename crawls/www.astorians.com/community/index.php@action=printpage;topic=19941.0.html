				$800 Cute store front in Astoria for sublease<br /><br />Details:<br /><br />We signed the lease on this space 8 months ago and have grown out of it. The space is a 200 sq. ft. store front located in a nice &amp; safe neighborhood in Astoria, Queens. Store comes with a roll down gate and brand new glass store front window. The space has a private unfinished basement with both sidewalk and in store access. The basement is the same size as the store and is completely dry and leak free.<br /><br />The space would be perfect as an office, art gallery, or other small retail store that does not require large amounts of inventory.<br /><br />Very close to Socrates Sculpture Park. Nearest train is the N/Q at Broadway or 30th Avenue. Minutes away from the Q100 &amp; Q69 buses on 21st Street. New restaurants and bake shops have recently opened on the street. Many new residences are bringing more and more people to the area<br /><br />Looking for someone to move in January 1st and carry out the terms of the one year lease (through March 31, 2011) with an option to renew for a second year.<br /><br />Monthly rent is $700 plus $100 monthly for taxes. Heat included. $1400 deposit plus first monthâ€™s rent due upon signing sublease.<br /><br />Please call 347-554-4016 if interested.<br /><br />Located near 14th Street &amp; 31st Ave.<br />
