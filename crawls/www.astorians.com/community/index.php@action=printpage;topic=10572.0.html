				Several weeks ago, my favorite spot for fruit and vegetables – Sunshine, on the corner of Ditmars and 38th Street -- closed. Confronted by large rent increases and spiraling electricity bills, the family who owned Sunshine for a few generations decided to pack it in.<br /><br />Sunshine was, in my opinion, the best produce spot in the neighborhood, a Ditmars institution, a member of the community, and will be sorely missed, at least by me. <br /><br />There have been several threads on this website moaning about the lack of this or that in Astoria, which baffles me especially in regard to food and food-related businesses. I admit the supermarkets are not tops (honestly, where in this city are there any good local supermarkets?) but I want to ask: is there any other neighborhood as blessed as Astoria when it comes to food choices?<br /><br />Here’s my moan: I wish we as a community would recognize the many terrific, high-quality food stores, bakeries, and shops and give them your business more often, instead of wishing for the arrival of corporate retail giants that will put them out of business.<br /><br />I know most of you reading this do support local shops but everytime I read yet another thread on this site about the desire for Fairway, Trader Joes, or Whole Foods and the like (and I have nothing against them whatsoever), I feel sad.<br />

				Sunshine was our go to place for THE BEST in vegetables and fruits. It is a shame how they closed as well. We had been using them probably close to four years. Apparently the landlord came in one day and said that he wanted to raise their rent. They balked and said you can&#039;t cause we have a lease. Show me said the landlord. They couldn&#039;t find their lease. So he gave them an ultimatum. So it sits empty for weeks now, I doubt that it will be rented out before the end of the summer. So now we go to Top Tomato, which isn&#039;t as good as Sunshine was, not even close, but we have always used ToTo since Sunshine closed early&nbsp; and ToTo is open 24/7. The only other option to use is the vegetable place on 23rd Ave next to the old Stamatis, which has excellent fruits and veggies. <br /><br />They were there since 1950 if I recall correctly.&nbsp; So almost 60 years!! What a shame!!

				I feel the same way. And I have to laugh when I walk into my local supermarket, which is literally called &#039;supermarket&#039; and I find my only favorite tea (Bigelow Cranberry Apple) for 30 cents cheaper than the cheapest price online, and none of the big chain stores carry it. Only Met food (which I still consider local because its a franchise owned by this awesome 40 year old Korean dude who chain smokes outside of it all evening) they have it but for 30 cents more. <br />I also happen to think Fresh Direct is gross. On various levels. <br />&#039;Support your local business&#039; week anyone?

				This is the way I shop -<br /><br />I go to the butcher for meat, the fish monger for fish, the bakery for baked goods, the green grocer for fruits and veggies etc.&nbsp; The day I am forced to shop in a supermarket (this includes Whole Foods, as much as I love them), I will have to move.

				Sort of new and improved, since the place which was next to the tattoo parlor, did some renovations, after the Sheriff seizure, and then promptly closed less than 2 weeks later. They then moved across the street to where Millennium Realty had their offices. And Millennium moved down next door to Martha&#039;s where the ice cream shop used to be. There is also a sign displayed in the window of the former location of said pawn shop which states that it is available to rent through who else?- Millennium Realty!!

				I&#039;m really sorry to hear this.&nbsp; I shop for my fruits and veggies at the shop on 23rd ave and 29th street, which was mentioned above.&nbsp; The people there are very nice, and the quality of produce is very good.&nbsp; I am there practically every day.&nbsp; I stopped buying any produce at Key Food after a few bad experiences (rotted fruit 3x). I don&#039;t eat meat anymore, but the quality of butchers in this neighborhood is amazing as well.
