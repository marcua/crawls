				Well, The Testimony portion of the trial is over and I must say it was fascinating. I&#039;m probably one of a few that read through most of the blogging transcripts. (Yeah, I&#039;m weird).<br /><br />Boies and Olson were amazing. And the defendants were strangely absent. They only presented two witnesses that the plaintiffs tore apart. I am eagerly awaiting the judges decision which will probably be months away. <br /><br />my favorite part was this from today......btw, they are both men.....the blogger said the courtroom doubled over in laughter.<br /><br />Boies: I don’t want to fall into the trap of making sex boring<br />Blankenhorn: MAybe together we can make it interesting<br /><br />

				The popular vote also produced racial segregation laws, which were ultimately deemed unconstitutional. <br />Unlike politicians, the supreme court does not exist to appease voters, it exists to make judgments on whether something is constitutional or legal under our current constitution and legislation. <br /><br />I&#039;m happy that Prop 8 was over-ruled.

First it goes to a 3 panel judge in the 9th Circuit, then, because of the importance of this decision, will likely be heard <em>en banc</em> -- by the full panel of judges in the 9th Circuit. Once the lower court decision is affirmed or overturned, then it can go up to the Supreme Court who can either agree to hear the case, or can deny certiorari -- refuse to hear it, thereby letting the circuit court decision stand.<br /><br />Here&#039;s where it gets interesting -- while the appellate courts can find that Walker&#039;s legal conclusions can be affirmed or overturned, his findings of <em>fact</em> stand. In other words, the sides don&#039;t get to provide new evidence. Walker&#039;s decision gives an amazingly detailed recitation of the facts, and he reviewed the case under both strict scrutiny and rational basis tests -- in other words, he covered his ass incredibly well, in anticipation of appellate review.<br /><br />The New York State case -- <em>Hernandez v. Robles </em> -- went to NYS&#039;s highest court, the Court of Appeals. It wasn&#039;t a &quot;lower level&quot; court, it was a different court system altogether. <br /><br />There&#039;s another NY case that gets very little press -- <em>Martinez v. County of Monroe</em> -- where the 4th Department appellate court (in upstate NY) held that since NYS recognizes out of state opposite sex marriages, it must recognize legal out of state same-sex marriages as well. The Court of Appeals declined to review it. <br /><br />So to answer your question, technically, yes, marriage is legal in California, but I believe there&#039;s been a stay of Judge Walker&#039;s order pending appeal. So while yes, it&#039;s lawful, it can&#039;t be put into practice just yet.

The voters of California voted for a Constitutional Amendment. This Amendment to the Constitution was made necessary because a previous proposition to define marriage between a man and woman was deemed against the Constitution of the State of California. <br />The burden of proof falls on the couples who are claiming that laws defining marriage as one man and one woman are in violation on the Constitution of the United States.&nbsp; Don&#039;t underestimate how huge this is. If this ruling stands, then every law in every state defining marriage as between a man and a woman will necessarily be overturned.<br />Personally, I don&#039;t think states should pass laws defining marriage at all. And if they do it should not be restricted to a single man and a single woman. But JoeyC is right. This is a horrible decision where a Judge set out from the beginning to over turn the will of the populace.&nbsp;

Co. v. Commissioner, 435 F.2d 118 (6th Cir. 1970), the court stated that on appeal, the court will not disturb findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous.<br /><br />On appeal the burden of showing that a finding is clearly erroneous is placed on the appellant.&nbsp; This burden is a heavy one, especially where findings are based on oral testimony.&nbsp; The appellant has to clearly point out where findings of the trial court are clearly erroneous.<br /><br />. . .<br /><br />When the appellant contends that findings of the trial court are clearly erroneous, the reviewing court must examine the entire record to determine whether the trial court’s findings can pass muster.&nbsp; The question on review is not simply whether the reviewing court would have found otherwise, but whether the trial court could permissibly find as it did.&nbsp; The choice made by the trial court between two permissible views of the weight of the evidence cannot be clearly erroneous.&nbsp; The Supreme Court will not overturn the concurrent findings of two lower courts lightly where an intermediate court reviews and affirms a trial court’s finds.&nbsp; If the Supreme Court is the only court of review it will engage in a traditional, clear error analysis.<br /><br />Although a higher than usual standard of proof is required of parties in a case does not expand the scope of appellate review, the review under the clearly erroneous standard can be affected by a stricter than normal standard of proof.<br /><br />. . .<br /><br />Generally, the clearly erroneous standard governs findings of fact about the significance of documentary evidence.&nbsp; In Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564 (U.S. 1985), the court stated that if the district court’s account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety, the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact, it would have weighed the evidence differently. Where there are two permissible views of the evidence, the fact finder’s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous. This is so even when the district court’s findings do not rest on credibility determinations, but are based instead on physical or documentary evidence or inferences from other facts.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Thanks Lanseaux. However, due regard can be pretty open ended in my mind. <br /><br />That being said, I have read in several places praise for the decision by Judge Walker to have a full trial because it does lay a solid foundation for the appeals that will follow. In other words, no one can say that he did it on the fly. <br /><br />If one reads his full decision, you will find that he listed around 88 findings of fact. He then lists the trial evidence that leads him to that conclusion. It&#039;s a brilliantly written decision and I encourage all to read it. <br /><br /><br />Here&#039;s a link if you are so inclined. <br />http://www.scribd.com/doc/35374462/Prop-8-Ruling-FINAL

				And in other news on Prop 8........Which I sure as hell didn&#039;t expect; Gov.
