			<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m always amazed at how attached so many NYCers are to their cars.&nbsp; They&#039;ll say they &#039;need&#039; a car for this and that...coming up with a litany of explanations as to why they can&#039;t do without a car.&nbsp; Often they&#039;ll say they have a car out of goodness for someone else, i.e., for their kids or their elderly parents.&nbsp; But...somehow, many folks with kids...many elderly...get along just fine without owning a private 2-ton street-hogging, gas-guzzling car, not to mention an SUV!<br /><br /><br />SUVs are like a virus...everyone now having one for &#039;safety&#039; or &#039;so they can see over the other cars&#039;.&nbsp; So what&#039;s next?...everyone is gonna start buying low-end priced Hummers for safety...because everyone else has a Hummer, so now I need one?<br /><br /><br />Back in the day entire families managed with a single car.&nbsp; Now everyone must have &#039;their own&#039; car, and typically an SUV.&nbsp; People grab the car keys to go 4 blocks to McDonalds for their Big Mac.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />I heard someone make a very interesting observation recently, about the strong car culture we have in the US.&nbsp; They said that, can you imagine private citizens demanding that the city allocate public space to them to keep a private possession?&nbsp; In other words, cars are private possessions, and yet drivers demand street parking.&nbsp; Take away a lane for them, for health-friendly, enviro-friendly bikes, and they get all up in arms.&nbsp; It&#039;s sorta like how gun-nuts get when we say we simply want gun control.&nbsp; &quot;Oh, no, you&#039;re not gonna take away OUR parking spots....you&#039;re not gonna take away a car lane from us for those &#039;bike people&#039;!!&quot; <br /><br /><br />Today it so happened I was out and about in Astoria, and right around the time when school was getting out.&nbsp; I was walking down ...I think it was 38th Street....towards 21st Avenue.&nbsp; I saw lots of schoolkids walking down the street, but what also struck me was.... there was an entire ROW of DOUBLE-PARKED cars down the entire length of 38th Street.<br /><br /><br />As I got to 21st Ave, same thing.... it was utter chaos....cars double parked on this block and that... all to pick up their spoiled lazy kids.&nbsp; I&#039;d be willing to bet that for a number of these kids, they live within a ten-block radius, yet here are the parents, chauffering them.&nbsp; There are other kids that surely live further away, and who are getting picked up.&nbsp; But then, I see plenty of other kids waiting for MTA buses to get home.&nbsp; Why can&#039;t these other kids do the same?<br /><br /><br />Sheesh.&nbsp; Talk about lazy, entitled, self-centered people.&nbsp; Nowadays, parents baby the kids.&nbsp; And the parents think nothing of causing major traffic jams to pick up their precious little darlings.&nbsp; If we don&#039;t like them double-parking....pulling out into traffic....blocking bike lanes.... tough luck!&nbsp; &nbsp;F U!&nbsp; Mind your own business!&nbsp; Right???<br /><br /><br />My word... people are just so self-centered nowadays.

			Hey yippee....I don&#039;t visit this site much anymore. It&#039;s probably been a year or so. I&#039;m actually constipated on the bowl right now and was super bored so I decided to take a gander on the site. It seems like there may be 3 active members left.<br /><br />I was not surprised at all to see you complaining once again about Astoria residents and their cars. Glad to find you are at least now concentrating on a specific type of car (i.e. the SUV). It was hilarious to see that a few threads down from this very thread, there you were again with a stupid &#039;open letter&#039; post to people that drive.<br /><br />Why are you so obsessed? Do you really think that people that pay 3k in monthly rent or drop a million on a delapitated home really give a s___ about your concerns about their driving habits and their large SUV&#039;s? If they want to pick up their kids from school or take a drive and get a coffee who the f___ are you to comment? <br /><br />Are you that bored? Why don&#039;t you go volunteer and keep yourself busy. Maybe go direct traffic. Help the cause. <br /><br />I have to go now. Thanks for keeping me busy.

Glad I left my hometown when I did. Too bad this site has gone downhill. It used to be so vibrant here. Arguments, disagreement, complaining about asshole landlords, car owners, hookah bars, crappy food festivals. Jeez peeps get a grip!
