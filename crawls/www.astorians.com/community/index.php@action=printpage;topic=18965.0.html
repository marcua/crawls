				I think it&#039;s heartfelt, but I wonder if the guy is getting paid by the word.&nbsp; It also sounds as if the relationship meant a lot more to him than to her.&nbsp; That sometimes happens - somebody changes your life, but it&#039;s not what they set out to do so they don&#039;t attach the same importance to events as you do.&nbsp; And what&#039;s this jive about New York women?

				You know how they say that when you break up and you need to say all the things that didn&#039;t get said, you should write a letter, but never send it? I&#039;ve done it. It works. I saved it for a few days on my desktop, then deleted it. Easy peasy.<br /><br />Well, this dude sent it to the whole freakin&#039; internet.<br /><br />I will say it seems like it comes from a well intentioned place. Maybe. If I were the woman in question, I&#039;d be creeped out. If I were her new husband, I&#039;d be PISSED.

				I agree with the &quot;self-absorbed&quot; label. She did so much for him, what did he do for her? Allison is right, it&#039;s the sort of letter you shouldn&#039;t share with anyone.
