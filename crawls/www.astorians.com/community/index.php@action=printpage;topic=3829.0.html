				** At the Beer Garden, this Wednesday (hope the place is welcoming)**<br /><br />http://drinkingliberally.org/<br /><br />queens@drinkingliberally.org<br /><br />&quot;What is Drinking Liberally?<br />An informal, inclusive progressive social group. Raise your spirits while you raise your glass, and share ideas while you share a pitcher. Drinking Liberally gives like-minded, left-leaning individuals a place to talk politics. You don&#39;t need to be a policy expert and this isn&#39;t a book club - just come and learn from peers, trade jokes, vent frustration and hang out in an environment where it&#39;s not taboo to talk politics.<br /><br />Bars are democratic spaces - you talk to strangers, you share booths, you feel the bond of common ground. Bring democratic discourse to your local democratic space - build democracy one drink at a time.<br /><br />While drinking liberally, always remember to drink responsibly, and make liberal use of designated drivers. Drinking and driving is reckless and irresponsible, like a neocon war or corporatist tax cut. Liberals, don&#39;t do it.&quot;<br /><br />http://upcoming.org/event/117977/

				Hey Tom, as I know you&#39;re not a liberal yourself, I wonder if you&#39;ve seen Markos (of Daily Kos)&#39;s recent commentaries on &quot;libertarian liberalism&quot; at the Cato Unbound web site?<br /><br />http://www.cato-unbound.org/2006/10/02/markos-moulitsas/the-case-for-the-libertarian-democrat/ (http://www.cato-unbound.org/2006/10/02/markos-moulitsas/the-case-for-the-libertarian-democrat/)<br />and followups on the rest of the page at:<br />http://www.cato-unbound.org/ (http://www.cato-unbound.org/)<br /><br />

				Harlan,<br />I play a liberal &nbsp;on TV. A conservative &nbsp;on the radio.<br />Probably been at more civil liberties events than either clans.<br /><br />Actually, I am used to being called liberal on social issues and conservative on economic issues.<br />Among Free Peoples, I might be considered a big govt voter.<br />Just that my idea of big govt is a fraction of what we have now.<br />The DailyKos and other notices regarding the libertarian viewpoint have bounced around quite a bit. I think it is often posturing. (sounds familiar)<br />I dont buy much into this libertarian voting bloc. But I would be happy if Democrats would take notice.<br />I have searched among the major parties for candidates much of my life.<br />Usually, I end up back at the cozy LP tent. It is small, but familiar.<br /><br />&quot;Groups&quot; that also draw my attention-<br /><br />http://www.freedomdemocrats.org/<br /><br />http://www.rlc.org/<br /><br />and remember too<br />http://www.gpnys.org/<br /><br />(How do we know when politicians lie? When they move their lips.)<br /><br />Found it interesting that some thought Howard Dean would have drawn more LBT votes than Kerry and hopefully Bush.<br /><br />In WA state, it is asked whether the Libertarian candidate for Senate will draw votes from the Republican or Democratic candidate. He plans to get his &quot;votes from the voters&quot;.<br />&nbsp;:mrgreen:<br /><br />***<br />http://www.rhsager.com/

				<br />http://www.janegalt.net/archives/009495.html<br /><br />Another viewpoint from someone who knows what life is like here.<br />I will be reminding that in NY, when you vote for Governor, you are indicating in part what political party you support.<br /><br />Some will be voting for John Clifton / Donald Silberger in the hope that the Libertarian Party might be included on Voter Registration forms.<br /><br />Just as others will be voting for McCourt hoping to return the Green Party to the forms.<br /><br />Working Families- Spitzer<br />Independence- Spitzer<br /><br />Conservative- Faso<br /><br />Republican- Faso<br /><br />Democrat- Spitzer<br /><br />***<br />T Tom<br />R Robespierre<br />X Xavier

				Drinking Liberally is a non-partisan, social networking/political discussion over alcohol event.&nbsp; They have chapters all over the US and a number in NYC, I am one of the hosts for Drinking Liberally Steps Out, the first LGBT one (now there are two DLSO chapters and a third forming).&nbsp; I haven&#39;t been to the one in Queens, but the meet-ups in Manhattan are always a blast.
