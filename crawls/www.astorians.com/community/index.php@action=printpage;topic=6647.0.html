				I doubt anyone does, but does anyone know of a men&#039;s or a coed softball league around here? Even if it was baseball, that would be better, but softball is still fun. I saw responses for women&#039;s softball, so I am hoping there are some guys out there that might know of a league to join, if not now, then in the Fall.

				I&#039;d also be very interested in joining a softball league in the neighborhood.&nbsp; I&#039;m rusy, but I love to play.&nbsp; If anyone knows of any leagues / teams looking for players, I&#039;d love some info.&nbsp; I know at least three of my college roommates who have just moved into the area who&#039;d be down to play as well.

				I am pretty sure that the Irish Rover and the Broadway Station have teams. I know that they have in the past. The Irish Rover is on 28th Ave and 37th or 38th street and Broadway Station is on Broadway between 30th and 31st Street. Good luck!

				I think many of the bars in Astoria have teams and then play each other. I know the Quays has a team as does Doyle&#039;s Corner. You can probably ask one of the bartenders if you are interested.

				I think it&#039;s a bit late in the season to join a league&nbsp; &nbsp;:|<br />I tried joining my company league, but they closed out registration June 1st. Been looking for a while now, and it doesn&#039;t seem like there is anything available. Please keep us posted if anyone finds something, or we should just start our own team for next season!

				Zog Sports organizes leagues, although most games are in Manhattan with a few on Roosevelt Island. The fall softball registration starts on July 16th. The league starts the beginning of September and runs Sunday and weekday evenings through the beginning of November.&nbsp; <br /><br />http://www.zogsports.org/Softball/Softball.htm

				Unfortunately, I&#039;ve never heard of a softball league run in the area.&nbsp; The local Y doesn&#039;t run a softball league.&nbsp; Also, there aren&#039;t too many fields left in the area.&nbsp; To me, the best fields would be the ICYP field in Ditmars.&nbsp; I think it would be great if a local league would be run out of there.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyone know of who runs that field?&nbsp; I see it empty most weekends.

				Kinda late to start up a something for 2007 (Labor Day usually marks the end of the softball/baseball season for most leagues).&nbsp; <br /><br />Hey, there&#039;s always next year. <br /><br />Like I said, I really think the ICYP fields would be perfect for a good Weekend night league.

				I would like to get something going where maybe on weekends or a weekday a group of us get together and take batting/fielding practice. I know the longer on the winter goes the less likely it will to happen, but it&#039;d be nice to get out and swing the bat some. I work at modell&#039;s so getting a discount on merchandise (ie. balls ) wouldn&#039;t be a problem.

				I&#039;m on the Zogzports team waitlist for late summer league, which I believe starts in August. I have about 15 friends doing it total, but we need about 4-5 more women or men. The cost when all is said &amp; done is going to be about $125 per person for the season, which includes the games and jerseys. <br />PM Me if interested, and I will get back to you with any details.<br />Thanks.

				Just a heads up, I am the manager of a fun but fairly bad softball team in Nassau County. We play Sunday late afternoon/early evening usually, and we are in need of one or two more guys. We are all pretty athletic, but most of our team are former high school and college lacrosse players so we tend to lose in softball. However, I think this could be our year!<br /><br />Anyway reply to this or email me at liman73@aol.com with some sort of softball subject heading if youre interested. I live in Astoria and I could drive you to the games if you need and you live close. Our games start late May/early June. Just a thought....<br /><br /><br />-Andrew

				My boys and I have an annual softball game, called &quot;the boom boom huck fest&quot; and its always a blast. That said, I&#039;d def. be interested in a league or just regular games, but F Finding a league, make the league!We can start &quot;the boom boom huck fest&quot; softball league. <br /><br />If you want to start by getting a game going in astoria, lemme no. It&#039;ll be easy to get 15-20 people together every Sunday, at least until Football season starts..
