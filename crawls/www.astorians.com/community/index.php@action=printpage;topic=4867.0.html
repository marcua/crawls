He has shorter hair though (he looks like the tabby with the mohawk in the pics), so the brush doesn&#39;t get caught on tangles or anything like that. Whenever I take out the brush thing, he goes crazy.<br /><br />Those shaved cats look sad :(

				The white cat looks good, but some of the others...well, I dunno - the shave is too close.<br />I have 5 cats . One has a very thick undercoat that gets matted and sheds all the time, even with constant combing. It&#39;s the kind of coat that no one wants to pet, so she does not get the attention of the other cats. I had her shaved last Spring for the first time - the vet called it &quot;the lion cut.&quot; I was a little shocked at first, but then grew to love it as I can really give her so much more physical attention...no more shedding. She honesltly seems happier, too. IMO the only drawback is the fact that the vet has to tranquilize the cat in order to do a nice shave.

				I have seriously been thinking of shaving my cat.&nbsp; He&#39;s adorable problem is he sheds A LOT and it&#39;s all over the place but my cat doesn&#39;t like to be he held down (traumatized from a kitten, I adopted him and he was pretty messed up someone must have really done some awful things to him) so I think that the only way to go is taking him to the vet and having him tranquilized but even with that......<br /><br />I just get a vision of walking in to pick up my cat and seeing everyone sliced to shreds and blood splattered all over the walls and a half shaven cat that looks like he crawled out of hell... :|

				LOL...it&#39;s not as bad as all that, really! I managed to locate a photo of my kitty after her &quot;lion cut&quot; last Spring. I can&#39;t wait to have her shaved again after this winter...she&#39;s shedding all over the place.<br />(http://img357.imageshack.us/img357/9012/dscf0006yf4.jpg) (http://imageshack.us)
