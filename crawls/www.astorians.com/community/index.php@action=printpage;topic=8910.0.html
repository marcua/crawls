				Or here&#039;s the report itself. (http://files.mlb.com/mitchrpt.pdf) 400 + pages though, but you can ctrl + F your way through for names.<br /><br />Almost no current players. Mostly guys who are out of the game already. Major shielding for lots of high profile team. Very few current Yanks or BoSox guys. Whoa.

				Thanks, paratactical.&nbsp; <br /><br />I heard that Clemens name was going to be in the report and it is.<br /><br />You know George Mitchell is a director of the Boston Red Sox, right?<br /><br />Taken from an article in the Boston Globe:<br /><br />On a nationally televised Fox baseball game, his investigation was called a public-relations ploy. It&#039;s been written that he has less power than a parking lot attendant, and he&#039;s been attacked as being biased because he is a director of the Red Sox. Even John Dowd, who conducted the gambling investigation into Pete Rose, says Mitchell&#039;s investigation has &quot;no teeth.&quot; Now he&#039;s even being called a &quot;human piñata.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Oh yeah. Totally aware of all the potential impropreity... Those these paragraphs are quite telling:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: pg267</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">When the Boston Red Sox were considering acquiring Gagné, a Red Sox official made specific inquiries about Gagné’s possible use of steroids. In a November 1, 2006 email to a Red Sox scout, general manager Theo Epstein asked, “Have you done any digging on Gagne? I know the Dodgers think he was a steroid guy. Maybe so. What do you hear on his medical?”425 The scout, Mark Delpiano, responded,<br /><br /><em>Some digging on Gagne and steroids IS the issue. Has had a checkered medical past throughout career including minor leagues. Lacks the poise and commitment to stay healthy, maintain body and re invent self. What made him a tenacious closer was the max effort plus stuff . . . Mentality without the plus weapons and without steroid help probably creates a large risk in bounce back durability and ability to throw average while allowing the changeup to play as it once did . . . Personally, durability (or lack of) will follow Gagne . . .426</em><br /><br />In order to provide Gagné with information about these allegations and to give him an opportunity to respond, I asked him to meet with me; he declined. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Actually, I am surprised.&nbsp; But that is in part because I haven&#039;t been following Pettite&#039;s career until recently.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been watching baseball on and off since 1982 (that&#039;s 25 years, yow) and when I was most intensely into it, I was just a teenager, and pretty naiive (not to mention gullible and trusting).&nbsp; I&#039;ve been fairly oblivious to the whole drug thing in baseball until this past year.&nbsp; <br /><br />Regardless, it&#039;s a sad day for baseball, though I hope this means that this is the first real step toward eradicating performance-enhancing drugs from the sport.<br /><br />

				The only thing that surprised me about the mitchell report was how few impact players were named.&nbsp; Out of the impact players that were named (the Clemenses, Pettiteses, etc) only Tejada is really an A list player who isn&#039;t at the tail end of his career.&nbsp; It&#039;s obvious that more guys were doping than the 88 players that were named, and it&#039;s a shame that Bud Selig opted to be a spineless weasel in this instance just like he&#039;s been the rest of his tenure as comissioner.&nbsp;

				There have always been unsubstantiated rumors about Roger Clemens and steroids.&nbsp; I&#039;m not surprised that his name is in the report.<br /><br />What&#039;s amazing are the names that are not in the report.&nbsp; All in all, it&#039;s a lot less spectacular that I had imagined it was going to be.&nbsp; A few well known names, but many I&#039;ve never heard of and plenty that are not even in baseball anymore.<br /><br />Will it change baseball?&nbsp; Perhaps.&nbsp; Remember, baseball had revenues of over 6 billion dollars this year.&nbsp; Baseball will protect itself.<br /><br />In happy news, A-Rod&#039;s contract is finalized!

So he got what he believes were 1/3 of them. You also have to keep in mind that Mitchel didn&#039;t name any players as using when teams they were on won the World Series. That&#039;s why all the Yanks mentioned talk about post-2000 incidents and the BoSox guys are pre-2003/4 guys. <br /><br />I think this happened for two reasons. First, and most obvious, is that the MLB and player&#039;s unions are not likely to be able to reach agreement on any level if all the WS titles end up being contested. Enough records are going to have trouble holding after this report. But second, that Mitchell&#039;s attempts to dig up evidence probably found people more willing to dish on guys who aren&#039;t playing any more or just plain aren&#039;t playing at the top of their game for the best ball park they played for. It&#039;s one thing to out Gagne when he&#039;s gone and another to trash guys who are currently in the game.<br /><br />While I wish it would have approached more of the current players, I think it&#039;s important to keep in mind that at least this is a first step for the game and hopefully not the last.<br /><br />

				I like that Pettite was a man and came clean.&nbsp; At the same time, when he used HGH it wasn&#039;t illegal nor was it banned by baseball, and was being used to recover from an injury, so to me it&#039;s sort of a moot point.<br />I don&#039;t know, to me the whole report is little more than gossip mongering that doesn&#039;t provide a solution to anything, all it told us was what these two baseball cards could have told us:<br /><br />(http://mlb.imageg.net/graphics/product_images/pMLB2-1477122dt.jpg)<br /><br />(http://barrybondsrookiecards.files.wordpress.com/2007/07/barry-bonds-rookie-card.jpg)
