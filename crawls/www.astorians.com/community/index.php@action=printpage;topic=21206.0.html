				Reviews? I can&#039;t find anything recent on here and that appears to be the closest gym to 23rd st/30th ave.

				I may get slammed for saying this, but I&#039;m being honest. <br /><br /><br />I was a member there several years ago when they first opened and it was called Dolphin. I left in 2005 because it had become very dirty - mice running around in the main exercise area and roaches in the locker. I&#039;m not kidding either. <br /><br /><br />I&#039;m told it&#039;s changed - a couple of people in my building go there. <br /><br /><br />If you go check it out, inspect the lockers, showers, etc. Unless that kind of stuff doesn&#039;t matter to you. <br />It did to me, which is why I left. <br /><br /><br />It was the closest gym to my house, but with conditions like that it wasn&#039;t worth staying there. <br /><br /><br />Good luck.

				Six years ago is a pretty long time.<br /><br /><br />I was a member there when it was Dolphin and also Synergy.&nbsp; It&#039;s fine with a decent amount of equipment and never noticed any cleanliness issues in the locker areas with Synergy.<br /><br /><br />The most annoying thing is when your membership is going to expire they call a bunch of times to try to retain you...so give them a fake phone number if you don&#039;t want to be bothered by their sales calls.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				That&#039;s true about the phone number. When I left there, they called my house constantly for a couple of months. <br />I actually went there in person and reminded them why I&#039;d left and they continued calling.<br /><br /><br />Finally, I wrote them a letter detailing why I let my membership expire and told that if they continued to contact me,<br />I&#039;d be forced to take legal action. <br /><br /><br />That ended it, but I wouldn&#039;t care now if they received an A+ grade for cleanliness, I still wouldn&#039;t go back.

				I was one of the original members of Dolphin Fitness (before it opened), and then it became Synergy.&nbsp; I also left (even before my membership ended) becaue of cleanliness problems.&nbsp; I kept getting sick every time I went back to the gym.<br />&nbsp;<br />However, that was many years ago (probably around 8), so I cannot speak to the current conditions.

				I used to go to Synergy and left 2 years ago because I moved and it wasn&#039;t convenient anymore.&nbsp; I went 5 days a week and never had a problem with the cleanliness (didn&#039;t shower there, though, so I can&#039;t speak about that).&nbsp; The machines seemed to always be in working order and I was usually able to get what I wanted without waiting.<br />&nbsp;<br />Agreed about the phone number--I told them why I was leaving the gym when I didn&#039;t renew, and they continued to call.&nbsp; I told each person on the phone that I had moved and that&#039;s why I was leaving, not because of a problem with the gym.&nbsp; Finally, I yelled at someone to stop calling and they stopped.&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing that they all work from a list of expiring memberships to call, and they don&#039;t coordinate with each other about who has already been called.

				This conversation went on here&nbsp; before, the annoying phone calls and all.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think manager was changed, maybe it&#039;s improved.&nbsp; They had the asshole of the century, an annoying guy to an extreme, running place.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think he&#039;s gone, so maybe it&#039;s improved.
