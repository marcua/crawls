				OK,&nbsp; I know this is a disgusting topic but nonetheless, I&#039;m sure many of you have experienced this.<br /><br />This morning I was on the N train, it was one of the new ones (REALLY NICE) and I was happy, listening to my music.&nbsp; This man sits next to me...<br /><br />He falls asleep, head falls back and starts snoring so hard the walls are vibrating THEN.......<br /><br />THEN........<br /><br />HE FARTED.<br /><br />IT WAS DISGUSTING.<br /><br />In his case, he was asleep (deep sleep) so you really can&#039;t blame the poor guy, maybe he just finished working a night shift.<br /><br />But it doesn&#039;t end there.....<br /><br />After the guy farted he didn&#039;t fall asleep again (I guess it woke him up).<br /><br />But I guess someone else took advantage of the opportunity that it stunk to let out another one (it smelled different so it wasn&#039;t from the same person).<br /><br />OMG JESUS..........HOW GROSS.<br /><br />If this keeps up I&#039;m going to become a fart analyst or something.&nbsp; <br /><br />Gross, it&#039;s 12:18 and I can still taste it in my mouth.<br /><br />Is it so hard to hold it until you&#039;re outside?&nbsp; <br /><br />UGH

				I wonder if the person who nodded you was the _arter?! Yeh, pretty nasty, but frankly, we have to contend with all sorts of smells in the city, how &#039;bout moving cars, could you do that? <br /><br />I try to avoid the completely empty ones...they&#039;re empty for a reason. What&#039;s even worse is society that has to negotiate their system so women don&#039;t get groped or harrased. In Japan, they have women only cars at certain times-can you believe what kind of epidemic that might be there for them to actually create hours and cars so women can avoid the manhandling? How &#039;bout slapping fines on those fellows, how about the woman shouts back and shuns the person doing this along with everyone else in the car. Instead, this culture says, yeh, we know it happens, oh well, here&#039;s another car for you womenfolk...

				I was on a plane flying back to NYC from Vegas, I&#039;m on the window a random girl is on the aisle.&nbsp; The middle seat was empty, so I guess they let this family on standby onto the plane.&nbsp; Well of course the 6 foot plus Dad takes our middle seat.&nbsp; Guy spreads his long legs out either way, pulls his hat down over his face, falls asleep, then proceeds to fart the whole flight to NYC.&nbsp; Everytime he&#039;d shift his weight another would come out.&nbsp; It was really bad, and I was stuck in the window.<br /><br />Plane lands, dude wakes up, stretches and gets off.&nbsp; I wanted to murder him, and I would have if it wasn&#039;t for the fact that he outweighed by at least 100 pounds.&nbsp; Also I&#039;m a coward.<br /><br />Farting on the train is rough too.&nbsp; I always try to make a face so no one will think its me.&nbsp; Its important to impress total strangers.

				Oh a plane.....that&#039;s horrible (worse) because at least on a train the doors open at each stop, in a plane it&#039;s all confined.<br /><br />Oh I feel for ya.

				The plane&#039;s a bad situation, but the air on a plane does get mostly replaced every few minutes. Heff, did you consider turning his little eyeball-vent-thingy at him full blast?&nbsp; :-P
