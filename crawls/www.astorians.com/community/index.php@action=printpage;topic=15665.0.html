Still, who is going to audit the auditors? Good&nbsp; question, and we are further away from that happening than ever.

Once I saw the quality of the work, I then got the DVD. (Send me a note if you may want to borrow the DVD.)<br />I have yet to check out some of the extra interviews/scenes.<br />I consider this a fan&#039;s production but quite a good one. If the filmmakers work on other topics, I would probably want to check out those as well.<br />The soundtrack adds to it.<br /><br />It has a positive bias, it shows quite the range of activists that were involved, it notes the expected feelings when one year&#039;s campaign ends.<br />Thankfully there are some very good commentators including a former FEC regulator.<br />I wonder though if it could have been better if other journalists or a more critical eye were involved.<br /><br />I believe the filmmakers are from Wisconsin and it uses an introduction of walkers from Lambeau Field talking to folks about the Constitution.<br />BTW, I think there plenty of good laughs in the film. <br /><br />Like when a Mom wants kids spared talk of the Constitution.<br /><br />One line that surprised me without a laugh.

				I find it unsettling that our elected officials don&#039;t have a periodic audit of the Federal Reserve Bank. Someone has to regulate the regulators. It doesn&#039;t make sense to leave them to their own devices.

				FYI, it should be interesting with Dr. Paul on the <span class="bbc_u">Daily Show </span> Tuesday.<br />&nbsp;:-D<br /><br />I remember when Stewart had quite the interview with Greenspan.<br /><br /><br /><br />Note, the Federal Reserve does have audits.<br />My understanding is the proposed Bill seeks greater disclosure and timeliness.<br />If voted in the House, it would be veto proof. The challenge would be in the Senate.<br /><br />More information. Released before end of 2010.<br />Does the Fed really depend on years of privacy for market assurance?

Mr. Sanders and other proponents of fuller audits of the Fed rejected those assertions and said they were providing adequate safeguards to protect the central bank’s integrity. <br /><br />While the Senate provision would require an audit of the Fed’s emergency operations beginning on Dec. 1, 2007, the House approved an even tougher audit requirement in its version of the financial regulatory legislation. <br /><br />Senator David Vitter, Republican of Louisiana, put forward an amendment that would have mirrored the tougher House language, but it was rejected. The vote was 37 to 62. <br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />&nbsp;:roll:
