				I&#039;m really not a very political person, but I am beginning to get really uneasy about the future of this country and with our potentials for leadership.&nbsp; I can&#039;t help think of that South Park in 2004, with the voting choices being: A Turd Sandwich and A Giant Douche.&nbsp; I<br /><br />I like him because he is intelligent, honest, and blunt.&nbsp; While I don&#039;t agree with everything he touts, I like him MUCH more than the pandering front runners that are his competition.&nbsp; He understands the state of this country is in trouble and he wants to change the status quo.&nbsp; I&#039;m up for ANYONE who does this and, IMHO, I don&#039;t believe any of the other front-running candidates will.&nbsp; <br /><br />In my humble opinion, Hillary is too much of a politician, flopping back and forth on issues to fit what she thinks the majority wants to hear and Rudy is too much of a fear monger that uses the threat of terrorism to scare the masses.&nbsp; He&#039;s probably going to get many more Americans killed in senseless war (likely Iran) and/or get more of the world pissed off at us due to aggression.&nbsp; <br /><br />Paul isn&#039;t isolationist; he just believes in foreign diplomacy, not threats or stick waving, as a way to go about foreign policy.&nbsp; When he called out Rudy in a debate a few months ago for using 9/11 to scare folks and said (paraphrasing) &quot;the terrorists don&#039;t hate us for our freedoms, they hate us for our aggressive foreign policy.&quot;<br /><br />I couldn&#039;t agree more.&nbsp; Terrorists don&#039;t attack Australia or Canada because they don&#039;t try to tell the rest of the world how to live.&nbsp; We do.&nbsp; Not everyone wants or is ready for a democracy; so we can&#039;t stuff it down their throats.&nbsp; Hell, Iraq itself was a country slapped together in the 20s by the League of Nations.&nbsp; How can we expect the differing views to just live in harmony in a democracy?&nbsp; Can&#039;t we just stay the hell out of other people&#039;s business?<br /><br />I saw Ron Paul have some GREAT points today when interviewing Ben Bernake (the Fed Chairman) on the dire conditions of the economy.&nbsp; Since Paul wants to abolish the Federal Reserve (and many other government agencies) this could help fix this mess.&nbsp; Paul follows another famous politician, Thomas Jefferson, in his distrust of the Federal Government controlling our finances.&nbsp; <br /><br />Here&#039;s one of Jefferson&#039;s quotes: &quot;The central bank is an institution of the most deadly hostility existing against the Principles and form of our Constitution. I am an Enemy to all banks discounting bills or notes for anything but Coin. If the American People allow private banks to control the issuance of their currency, first by inflation and then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the People of all their Property until their Children will wake up homeless on the continent their Fathers conquered.&quot;<br /><br />This is exactly what is happening.&nbsp; For those who don&#039;t follow what goes on, the Fed is making you poorer to keep the cohorts on Wall Street afloat.&nbsp; By them dropping the interest rates and printing massive amounts of cash, they&#039;re devaluing our currency.&nbsp; Basically, that means your money has less spending power.&nbsp; Google &quot;Inflation&quot; and look into what happened in Germany between WWI and WWII when their government just kept printing more money to pay off their debts.&nbsp; With our currency devaluing and energy costs, food costs, and just about everything else costing more, we&#039;re getting screwed; big business is getting saved.<br /><br />Sorry to get off on a rant.&nbsp; I&#039;m just worried about the future of our country, both foreign and domestic, and wanted to get his name out there&nbsp; and, hopefully, interest enough of you to find out a little more.&nbsp; I don&#039;t work for a campaign, I don&#039;t get any money for pushing him, I don&#039;t have any ulterior motives.&nbsp; I&#039;d just like to help, if I can, give a little more info on one of our choices for President.&nbsp; Take it or leave it and, please, feel free to add any comments; positive or negative are welcome.

				Thanks for the great post.&nbsp; Not that I think it will come to it, but I would support Paul in the general elections (or the primaries if I were able).&nbsp; That being said, I feel that you may have put too fine a coat on Dr. Paul&#039;s positions.&nbsp; What I have come to find is that his supporters will pick up on one thing they like about him and leave the rest.&nbsp; The problem with that approach is that you will get the whole package if he is elected.&nbsp; Don&#039;t like the Iraq War? Ron Paul will end it, along with our attachment to the UN, and NATO and humanitarian aid to developing nations.&nbsp; Do you think that federal government should not be bailing out banks who clients are defaulting on mortgages? Neither does Ron Paul, but he also wants to do away with federal government spending on education. <br />I am glad that he is running and wish that his positions are discussed intelligently.&nbsp; But I don&#039;t think that the federal reserve can be dismantled and the nation returned to the gold standard. I may be wrong on this, but I certainly would like to know more.<br />BTW, I agree with much of your post, but the horrific bombing in Bali was targeted against Australians, and Canada certainly has had Her own issues with Islamic terrorism.

				I have to agree with Sweeper.&nbsp; Most Western nations have had their problems with terrorism at this point:&nbsp; http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/americas/06/03/canada.terror/index.html <br />It&#039;s hard to say that our foreign policy is the only or even main reason for such plots.&nbsp; Other reasons include a desire to propagate a specific brand of religion.<br /><br />There are aspects of Ron Paul&#039;s candidacy I like, but then, I&#039;m a conservative.&nbsp; I am a little puzzled as to what his appeal is to left leaning people.&nbsp; Seems like I see a lot of progressive activist types and young people holding up Ron Paul signs.&nbsp; This is very interesting to me, a conservative, because on many issues, Paul is MUCH more conservative than I am.&nbsp; I can&#039;t see why his ideas would play out well with the protest crowds.<br /><br />In my personal opinion, I think it just goes to show how polarizing the war issue is.&nbsp; None of the main line Dem or Repub candidates are unabashedly against the war, so this guy who is perceived as a plain dealing, tell it like it is antiwar candidate with libertarian leanings is getting some positive attention from the disillusioned.&nbsp; But I wonder how they would feel if they knew some of his social positions.

				Thanks for the reply, Sweeper.&nbsp; I agree, there are a few downsides to Paul, as well.&nbsp; However, that is part of the game.&nbsp; No candidate is going to be perfect for all of us in every situation, so we go with who has the most positives in our eyes, right?<br /><br />I&#039;m not attacking you, but I would like to address, to the best of my ability (which isn&#039;t that great so, please, read for yourself), your concerns. When he talks about getting out of the UN, NATO, CAFTA, NAFTA, etc. so that they can no longer have control over our lives.&nbsp; If you read about some of the agendas of these groups are not in the best interest of the United States.&nbsp; They want to impose taxes on our goods, laws on our people, and force us to utilize our thinly stretched military might on battles we don&#039;t choose to fight.<br /><br />Also, if you read his site (I&#039;ll post the link at the bottom of his &quot;issues&quot; page), he SPECIFICALLY states that he does not want the US to be isolationist.&nbsp; Since no one says it better than him, here&#039;s the exact wording: &quot;At the same time, we must not isolate ourselves. The generosity of the American people has been felt around the globe. Many have thanked God for it, in many languages. Let us have a strong America, conducting open trade, travel, communication, and diplomacy with other nations.&quot;<br /><br />While he doesn&#039;t specifically say on his site that he wants to do away with the federal government spending on education, he does say he wants to bring home schooling to an accepted level like public schooling.&nbsp; The main thing here is that, while he might want to reduce federal spending on education, he mainly wants to get the federal government out of the individual states&#039; realm of government.&nbsp; ALSO, since wants to reduce or end federal income taxation, this would provide more money in each household&#039;s paychecks that would help cover the costs of the education of their choice.&nbsp; It removes the tax burden placed on all people and allows more free choice.&nbsp; <br /><br />He&#039;s a smart, well-educated man, that I highly doubt wants to see American children not receive a quality education.&nbsp; I don&#039;t believe that he intends to leave the education system in shambles.<br /><br />As for abolishing the Federal Reserve and returning the country to the gold standard: I don&#039;t know exactly how he plans to do that, although you have prompted me to do more research and, if I find the answer, I&#039;ll post it up.&nbsp; The bottom line is this: the way the Fed is printing money is EXTREMELY detrimental to our economy and population as a whole.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you like to read about financial issues, I recommend picking up a book called &quot;Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds&quot; by Charles Mackay.&nbsp; It&#039;s an excellent book written back in 1841 that talks about previous stock/real estate/speculative bubbles in the past.&nbsp; Some of these were: The South-Sea Bubble (England around 1720), The Mississippi Scheme (France around 1719-1720), and Tulipomania (The Dutch in the early-mid 1600s).&nbsp; Anyway, this book describes &quot;mania&quot; where greed took over and reason was lost.&nbsp; Credit rates were overextended, central banks became involved in companies&#039; fate, and the governments took their base valuing off gold and coin and put it on money; which they printed more and more of.&nbsp; This caused mass-hysteria and ensuing pandemonium as these runs made the commoner vastly wealthy, only to have it all come crashing down and taking those very same people, and more, into poverty. <br /><br />Now, this might seem a bit extreme right now, but it&#039;s really not too far off from what&#039;s happening in the U.S., and the world, right now.&nbsp; Skyrocketing real estate values had brought riches and higher wealth to many people.&nbsp; Speculation and easy credit drove values up to astronomical values and allowed people to take loans out on these higher values and spend more money.&nbsp; But, it started to falter in 2005 and, now, has really only begun to get bad.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />According to Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan, there are almost 30 BILLION dollars in subprime and adjustable rate loans resetting to higher values EVERY MONTH.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure many of you have read about it in the news.&nbsp; Well, it&#039;s ONLY STARTED to get bad.&nbsp; The first large reset month was last month and it is going to continue through the end of 2008.&nbsp; The New York market isn&#039;t immune, either.&nbsp; The only reason things have not been as bad here is because, on average, it takes 488 days for a home to go into foreclosure in New York; opposed to 21 days in Texas and a few months in NV, CA, FL, etc. (the states you&#039;re already reading about).&nbsp; So, there&#039;s a lag in what is going to happen here.&nbsp; <br /><br />So, to &quot;combat&quot; this problem, the Fed is dropping interest rates.&nbsp; But, this only devalues the US Dollar versus other currencies.&nbsp; For those of you that don&#039;t follow, the Canadian dollar is actually worth ~1.06 American dollars.&nbsp; I&#039;m only 25 and I remember as recently as 6 years ago going to Canada and the getting almost TWO Canadian dollars for one US dollar.&nbsp; So, basically, my money has become worth half as much in 6 years.&nbsp; I also remember paying $1.14 for 1 Euro and $1.61 for 1 Pound Sterling in 2003.&nbsp; Those rates are now $1.46 for 1 Euro and $2.05 for one Pound Sterling.&nbsp; Again, my money is worth less.<br /><br />On top of our money being worth less, inflation is getting higher.&nbsp; Fuel costs much more; food costs much more; the things we use on a daily basis cost much more.&nbsp; Oil is almost $100 a barrel.&nbsp; Homes aren&#039;t selling, values aren&#039;t increasing, and people are getting stuck with higher payments or foreclosure.<br /><br />We might not be in such a bubble that those previous &quot;manias&quot; were, but China is.&nbsp; They have stock trading kiosks at banks, so people can cash their checks and buy stocks.&nbsp; People who know nothing about stocks are making money hand over fist and driving values up to astronomical levels.&nbsp; Their entire market is up about 300% in ONE YEAR.&nbsp; The caveat is this: Unlike in the US, the Chinese can&#039;t short (profiting when a stock goes down) stocks.&nbsp; So, they, especially the government with the Olympics coming there, have a vested interest in having it continue to go up.&nbsp; The main concern is that with all of our free trade this and that, we are reliant on them and the success of their economy.&nbsp; If they crash, we&#039;ll likely crash, and so will the rest of the world.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, I got WAY off on a tangent and I apologize.&nbsp; I&#039;m VERY worried about the future of this country.&nbsp; While Paul may be a little out there with some of his ideas and I might not agree with everything he does, but I agree with most of it.&nbsp; And, most importantly, he&#039;s a CHANGE from the status quo.&nbsp; He sticks to his principles and doesn&#039;t change his views because they aren&#039;t &quot;popular.&quot;&nbsp; He doesn&#039;t BS about the dire conditions this county faces and he wants to shake things up.&nbsp; I think that&#039;s what we need.<br /><br />Man, that&#039;s a ramble.&nbsp; Anyway, if you want to skip my diatribe and just get to the facts, here&#039;s his site discussing his issues: http://www.ronpaulforpresident2008.com/pages/issues.html#EndingtheIRS<br />&nbsp;(http://www.ronpaulforpresident2008.com/pages/issues.html#EndingtheIRS)

				IMO, the conservative/liberal classifications are just my side/your side distinctions: E.g, how does being conservative or liberal affect the debate on abortion, same-sex marriages, gun control and affirmative action?&nbsp; &quot;Cons&quot; ask for more government control on the former two and less on the latter two while &quot;Libs&quot; ask for the opposite.&nbsp; There is no real application of principles by either side.&nbsp; Both labels have been swept into the demographic support which the two majors parties have garnered ever since the New Deal.&nbsp; That being said, I think that we see some &quot;liberals&quot; now supporting Ron Paul because the war, the erosion of civil liberties and the rapid acculmulation of power by the federal government has caused a requestioning of the my side/your side loyalties, in particularly because it doesnt seem that the democrats will end the war very quickly or restore our civil liberties rapidly or cede power back to the states.&nbsp; I am one of those folks and I like Ron Paul.&nbsp; <br /><br />As for the attacks as a way to propogate certain types of religion:&nbsp; I think one of the major dangers of calling our foes madmen is that we actually start believing it after a while.&nbsp; How dimly must we view our adversaries if we suppose them to think that <em>performing acts of terrorism would get us to change our religions</em>?&nbsp; They are not madmen, far from it.&nbsp; They are rational individuals who are respondng in one of the few ways they can to the worlds only superpower who has agressively meddled with their lands for a half a century.

You&#039;d end up with full Federal gridlock with congress once again flexing it&#039;s muscle against the executive branch - something I feel is desperately needed right now and is frankly not happening with the republicans or democrats in control. I don&#039;t think Paul would get a lot &quot;done&quot;, but it could potentially be a really good exercise for the country to go through imho.<br /><br />Generally it&#039;s a breath of fresh air to hear the likes of Paul and Kucinich talking about abuse and corruption within the Federal government openly. Even though I may not agree with them on all the little things, I trust these guys to a greater degree than a lot of the other options that exist at the moment.

				There are many reasons i would never ever support Ron Paul ( http://www.somethingawful.com/d/news/google-ron-paul2.php this provides a good look at a Ron Paul Presidency). I am on the left, though I do love watching Ron Paul speak during the Republican debates (which I watch because I love debates regardless of who is participating). Ron Paul had the best response to when Mitt Romney said he would consult his attorneys before attacking Iran. <br /><br />As with the guy above me, I love Kucinich the best. I agree with him on every issue, and we need more politicians like him, thought for the 2008 election I will most likely end up supporting one of the mainstream candidates (I have a feeling I&#039;ll end up pulling the lever for Hillary, but who knows). <br /><br />Ron Paul&#039;s candidacy might have a good long term effect for both sides though, because if he can successfully win or at least do extremely well in the Iowa Caucus or any of the early primary races, he can demonstrate that the internet can indeed be a useful tool for obtaining votes, as this idea has faded a lot since Howard Dean&#039;s campaign in 2004. Ron Paul&#039;s use of the internet and other new campaigning techniques can serve as a model for both sides in future local and presidential races.<br /><br />I can&#039;t see Ron Paul winning the republican nomination or the presidency, and I don&#039;t think a lot of his supporters see the problems with a lot of his views, as he would get rid of a lot of government services people currently rely on (ie: public education). Right now the media is focused on his anti-war stance due to his position as a minor candidate in the Republican field, but if he was somehow able to pull an upset and become an actual contender for the Republican nomination, the media would then start to focus on some of those more extreme views he has. It is these reasons Ron Paul will most likely never become President.

				I am happy to hear that there are some Kucinich supporters even among the Ron Paul supporters.&nbsp; It&#039;s strange, considering the two seem to be on opposite ends in terms of social issues.&nbsp; I am a big Kucinich supporter and was very happy to see him win Democracy for America&#039;s (DFA) recent Presidential Pulse Poll.&nbsp; I was saddened to see that DFA did not publicize this fact at all, and you can be sure they would have if Hillary, Al, or Barack had won instead.&nbsp; This is a man who never backs down, who never shies away from his principles, has never wavered in his stance.&nbsp; He knew all along this war was a sham, and said so the whole time, so it&#039;s hard for me to believe every other politician who just claims they were tricked by Bush into approving this ill-conceived war.&nbsp; On the war and the Patriot Act, Ron Paul doesn&#039;t differ much from Kucinich, and I suspect this is why many liberals find themselves in support of him.&nbsp; I do like his stance and love the fact he&#039;s so blunt and to the point about it.&nbsp; However, that is not enough for me to support Ron Paul as an entire package.&nbsp; As a woman, I cannot get past his stance on abortion.&nbsp; Although many cite the fact that he is for state&#039;s rights regarding this issue, he is abundantly clear in that he does not support a woman&#039;s right to choose under any circumstances, even to save her life.&nbsp; He means to abolish Roe vs Wade and does not hide this fact.&nbsp; I do not like his stance on education, immigration, gun control, and other issues.&nbsp; I do not know how he feels about universal health care or the rights of rights of LGBTQ Americans and cannot find reference to it on his site.&nbsp; When you elect someone, you get the whole package, not just the parts you like.&nbsp; Many of the Democrats are also now saying they want to end the war, but I look past that to see the differences amongst their stances on other issues as well.&nbsp; Dennis Kucinich is the closest I get to having someone that represents how I feel on most every issue.&nbsp; Unfortunately, neither Dennis nor Ron will ever get the attention from the media that the questions they present really deserve, and I too fear for this country.&nbsp; But I also feared for it 8 long long years ago and my fears have already been confirmed.&nbsp; A comedian summed it up best last night, - hasn&#039;t it felt like forever that Bush has been in office?&nbsp; It&#039;s exhausting.

				Very cool. He&#039;s not minting currency (which I believe is only allowed to Congress in the Constitution), he&#039;s in effect creating a barter system.

				Here&#039;s my best description, which will probably need help.<br /><br />Basically, the coins are made of precious metals (silver, nickel, copper, etc.) and are worth a base amount because, in theory, you could melt them down and have that metal.&nbsp; This price will vary, in general, as the price of the goes up or down, but it is highly likely it is going hold it&#039;s value.<br /><br />Back before Nixon and 1971, a dollar was called a &quot;promissory note.&quot;&nbsp; You were able to, if you wanted to, take a walk down to a U.S. Treasury vault and trade in your dollars for a specific amount of gold (1/35th of an ounce per $1).&nbsp; This is part of the reason why things were so much cheaper when you were a kid.&nbsp; $1 had much more value, inflation was in better check, and the government was unable to just &quot;print more money&quot; (which floods the market and causes inflation.&nbsp; Read about Germany before WWII, when their government did this and you had to take wheelbarrows of money to buy a loaf of bread).<br /><br />Now, in 1971, Nixon took us off the gold standard so that he could pay back debts for the Vietnam war (somewhere in the neighborhood of $500 billion dollars).&nbsp; He made the US Dollar based off of, basically, credit.&nbsp; It is now based off of of the potential of the US economy (it&#039;s goods, it&#039;s holdings, etc.).&nbsp; Something that is nowhere near as tangible.&nbsp; Also, it allows the government to print more as they please (and as they are doing now) because, basically, the money isn&#039;t worth ANYTHING.&nbsp; There is nothing to back it.<br /><br />Here is a very interesting article about it that explains the money system in a little more detail and might open your eyes about the problems with things being the way they are.&nbsp; It also talks about, perhaps, why we are in Iraq NOW and why we&#039;re getting aggressive with Iran.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know the author or his views, so I&#039;m not claiming it is 100% truth or not exaggerated.&nbsp; However, it does pose some VERY interesting points and is DEFINITELY worth reading.&nbsp; Even if you aren&#039;t a supporter or don&#039;t believe it when you&#039;re done, it&#039;s something to take a look at.<br /><br />http://www.mondovista.com/money.html (http://www.mondovista.com/money.html)<br /><br />It also is another good reason, in my opinion, to take a look at Ron Paul.&nbsp; He sees what this &quot;flat currency&quot; is doing to society and intends to do everything he can to stop it, including putting us back on the gold standard.&nbsp;

They back that promise with hard currency reserves like the gold locked away in Fort Knox. However -- and I might be mistaken -- I believe that even though your bill says $10, the government is not completely beholden to honor that promise to give you &#039;ten dollars&#039; should you demand it.<br /><br />In other words (though this is highly unlikely here, but it has happened in other countries), the government can say that they don&#039;t have enough gold to back up that 10-spot, along with the gajillion others in people&#039;s pockets, and make it of less real value. Like $8.50, or $3.12 or what have you. That&#039;s when people start dumping (er, exchanging) US currency for either another one (Yen, Deutschmarks, Pounds Sterling, etc.) or for literally cold hard cash -- ie gold and silver.<br /><br />But still, your average American keeps the faith with the government that the dollar is worth something. Otherwise, folks would be ditching it for fear of it collapsing entirely. YOu&#039;d see rampant devaluation and the dollar would become something like the Russian Ruble in the 1990s or the Brazilian Real in the 1980s. IMO, faith in the dollar not near breaking point, but we&#039;re approaching it and I fear most of us will be shocked when it does happen.&nbsp; :|<br /><br />The value of what that guy was minting wasn&#039;t based on a promise of value, but an actual, measurable market value at a given time for the metals contained. One could argue that that isn&#039;t necessarily predictable since market prices go up and down, but then again, how much more could you buy from a tenner 20, 30 years ago than you could now? And with the dollar losing value vis-a-vis other currencies, that 10 bucks is less promising elsewhere in the world.<br /><br />And SeminoleB makes some excellent posts -- and that article is an interesting read too. Thanks for the link.....<br /><br />I don;&#039;t know enough about the gold standard, and on the surface, it may seem like a good idea. However, I believe that the risk is currency instability since gold can be hoarded and that there&#039;s a finite supply of it. Accordingly, gold is an inadequate measure the growth of wealth.

				Regarding the value of U.S. currency, I had shared some remarks about the effect of the national debt on it (and other things) a few months ago in a rant that didn&#039;t exactly go over well here. <br />http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=7334.0<br /><br />I&#039;m hoping that I&#039;ll have an opportunity to vote for Paul. I gathered signatures to get him on the ballot in MA and CT as a Libertarian in 1988 but was too young to vote for him. Though I don&#039;t believe the Republican Party deserves his candidacy, there is no doubt that he has benefited from running as a Republican. The fact that the philosophy of liberty gets any recognition from national press is refreshing. Thanks to Dr. Paul, presumably some viewers of the Tonight Show with Jay Leno looked up Austrian economics who might otherwise have never been aware of it. Pretty cool.<br /><br />Anyone here going to the Tea Party?

				<br />http://www.bloomberg.com/news/politics/<br /><br /><br />Nov. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Presidential candidate Ron Paul said he has raised more than $9 million in the past two months and he predicted his campaign will exceed its $12 million fourth-quarter goal. <br /><br />&lt;&gt;<br /><br />Paul said he has begun ``spending generously&#039;&#039; in key early- primary states. He is competing in New Hampshire, Iowa, South Carolina and Nevada, and said he expects to have money to campaign through Super Tuesday, Feb. 5, when at least 22 states may hold primaries and decide the nomination. &nbsp;<br /><br />&lt;&gt;<br /><br />With his campaign rallies drawing fiscal conservatives, civil libertarians, anti-war activists and Green Party members, Paul said the time is right for a third-party candidate. He said that, while his supporters are representative of the nation&#039;s voters, he has ``no intention&#039;&#039; of being a third-party candidate. <br /><br />&lt;&gt;<br /><br />Paul&#039;s message has attracted free-market advocates and civil libertarians who transcend generational, geographic and even political boundaries. He is endorsed by Barry Goldwater Jr., son of the former senator and one-time presidential candidate. On Nov. 20, GQ Magazine named Paul its ``Dark Horse of the Year.&#039;&#039; <br /><br />...<br /><br />***<br />I love it when commentators are asking why Romney rallies draw a fraction compared to the Dr&#039;s.<br /><br />

Which is liberating in a way for non-Dems because they can vote purely on the basis of belief and not compromise. <br /><br />As long as I&#039;m in such a heavily weighted blue district, I will gladly vote libertarian.<br /><br />But if the presidential election comes down to Giuliani and Clinton and he&#039;s got strong support here (possible, but not likely), I will vote Giuliani. My election mantra is &quot;anybody but Hillary&quot;.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;d say Hillary is well positioned to become the first female president of the U.S. I offer this opinion unhappily, purely from a tactical vantage point. She is a cold, calculating political beast with acid for blood and an organ where other people have hearts that runs on power-tripping ambition. She has &quot;the machine&quot; behind her, and in a year that finds the Republican Party&#039;s base crumbling to bits (finally this party&#039;s betrayal of liberty-oriented, small government conservatives is coming home to roost and simultaneously religious conservatives are panicked over the electability magnet lodged up secular Guiliani&#039;s wahoo) she&#039;s my current pick for our next president. Even if she loses Iowa. <br /><br />I think Mrs. Clinton enjoys an immense voter turnout advantage over any Republican contender except, in a fantasy world, Ron Paul (just imagine the debates with Paul...he&#039;d destroy her). And if she really has her way as President, this country&#039;s poor and middle income folks will get dosed with the obsolete and lethal European socialism that wealthy and/or profoundly misguided lefties have admired from afar for so long. Makes me queasy, but I can&#039;t see how the Democrats can lose the upcoming presidential election.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the Republican Party will be defined anew by this election. Whereas the last two elections certainly laid the groundwork for redefining the Republican Party, it could have been argued before the current crop of Republican presidential candidates emerged that George W. Bush was more to blame, personally, for the horrible mess that is Iraq. But with all of the front-running Republican candidates embracing pro-war...that is, pro-preemptive war stances (gulp), I&#039;d say the Republican Party is marching down a path to obsolescence. The party is no longer credible as a free market alternative to the Democratic Party and its pro preemptive war stance is reckless, unconstitutional, outrageous. <br /><br />I have mixed feelings about the demise of the Republican Party. I like to believe that sensible Democrats exhausted by their party&#039;s wish-driven, faith-based, anti-empirical, anti-liberty economics will join up with politically homeless small government Republicans (classical liberals, basically) who are pro-civil liberties to form a new, larger libertarian-leaning coalition. One the one hand, that would be wonderful. On the other hand, I&#039;m not sure that there are enough of these people to form a majority or gain significant political influence. <br /><br />Buy gold. Buy Euros. And try to convince people that the real tension in this country is not between Republicans and Democrats, but rather between Professional Politicians (and the ecosystem of interest groups that support them) versus individual taxpayers, entrepreneurs, people who believe that wealth should be earned by mutual consent rather than gained by expropriation.

So, do what it takes to defend the borders from being crashed by people. <br /><br />That said, as far as I know, Dr. Paul has no problem with dramatically increasing the number of legal immigrants allowed to come to the U.S. each year. His economic understanding is fairly sophisticated and basically classical liberal, therefore his basic economic evaluation of immigration, on that level alone, should be that legal immigration is a good thing.

They back that promise with hard currency reserves like the gold locked away in Fort Knox. However -- and I might be mistaken -- I believe that even though your bill says $10, the government is not completely beholden to honor that promise to give you &#039;ten dollars&#039; should you demand it.<br /><br />In other words (though this is highly unlikely here, but it has happened in other countries), the government can say that they don&#039;t have enough gold to back up that 10-spot, along with the gajillion others in people&#039;s pockets, and make it of less real value. Like $8.50, or $3.12 or what have you. That&#039;s when people start dumping (er, exchanging) US currency for either another one (Yen, Deutschmarks, Pounds Sterling, etc.) or for literally cold hard cash -- ie gold and silver.<br /><br />But still, your average American keeps the faith with the government that the dollar is worth something. Otherwise, folks would be ditching it for fear of it collapsing entirely. YOu&#039;d see rampant devaluation and the dollar would become something like the Russian Ruble in the 1990s or the Brazilian Real in the 1980s. IMO, faith in the dollar not near breaking point, but we&#039;re approaching it and I fear most of us will be shocked when it does happen.&nbsp; :|<br /><br />The value of what that guy was minting wasn&#039;t based on a promise of value, but an actual, measurable market value at a given time for the metals contained. One could argue that that isn&#039;t necessarily predictable since market prices go up and down, but then again, how much more could you buy from a tenner 20, 30 years ago than you could now? And with the dollar losing value vis-a-vis other currencies, that 10 bucks is less promising elsewhere in the world.<br /><br />And SeminoleB makes some excellent posts -- and that article is an interesting read too. Thanks for the link.....<br /><br />I don;&#039;t know enough about the gold standard, and on the surface, it may seem like a good idea. However, I believe that the risk is currency instability since gold can be hoarded and that there&#039;s a finite supply of it. Accordingly, gold is an inadequate measure the growth of wealth.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The Gold Standard was what the country&#039;s currency WAS based off of until 1971 and Nixon, so Paul wanting to go back to it is not a crazy idea.&nbsp; The only problem is, now, since the dollar was taken off that standard and based off the output of the US economy, you CAN&#039;T take it to Ft. Knox and get an equivalent amount in gold, nor do we have that equivalent in gold.&nbsp; We can thank the Fed for just printing more money to pay our bills, thus further damaging our currency.<br /><br />The bills are, as stated in that article, no longer &quot;promissory notes.&quot;&nbsp; Our currency is susceptible to collapse, just like the others in the past, because it is based on the &quot;promises&quot; of an overspending, overprinting, and heavily in debt government.&nbsp; Yay.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=8578.msg102440.html#msg102440">Quote from: adamwc on November 23, 2007, 07:47:52 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">All the U.S. government has to do is stop susbsidizing oil companies in any and all ways.

The Soviets responded by sending door-breakers to Beirut who captured relatives of the militants, returning only their (amputated) private parts.

				I&#039;ve been trying to learn more about the history, beliefs, and doings of our fore fathers and, seriously, Sam Adams is one bad mo fo.&nbsp; I&#039;m reading a book about him, Radical of the Revolution, and I have to say that I&#039;m very impressed.<br /><br />Also, many of the things he rallied people about and the obstacles he faced are the same things that we have problems with now.&nbsp; There are a few quotes I&#039;ve found already that make me think of today&#039;s issues, and I&#039;m only about 1/3 of the way through the book.&nbsp; He strikes me as being very similar in views as Ron Paul.<br /><br />&quot;I&#039;m tired of hearing that we cannot change the status quo! I&#039;ll never believe that! Not when there are so many intelligent people in this country. Not when they could be made to realize that they are losing more and more of their freedom as time goes by. If they could just be awakened to how dangerous Parliament is; if they could just come to know how easy it would be for the aristocrats to take all their liberties away! Then surely people would rise up and force Parliament to guarantee their freedom. Someone must make the people understand how great their power is! Someone must teach them that they alone have the power to govern!&quot;<br /><br />This quote makes me think so much of now.&nbsp; I know so many that are unhappy with the current situation and not too impressed with the &quot;front-runners,&quot; but it just seems so futile to go another direction.&nbsp; Just think about us, even.&nbsp; Many support Paul but don&#039;t think he&#039;s got a chance.&nbsp; WHY?<br /><br />When Adams was talking about why he and his &quot;workingman&#039;s&quot; group has been unsuccessful at making any headway against the Court party, &quot;The governor has every avenue of communication open to him: his public proclamations, the courts, the legislature, the newspapers. We have nothing but our tongues, and I know now that persuasive talk alone is not enough.&quot;<br /><br />Again, this makes me think of so many things.&nbsp; Paul&#039;s inability to receive as much &quot;face-time&quot; as the other candidates.&nbsp; On top of that, it makes me think of the stranglehold the government and the front-runners seem to have on the media.<br /><br />Another one that hits home to our economic conditions now. He talks about suggesting that the government investigate the great fortunes made in the past and currently. &quot;Would such an investigation not reveal that many such fortunes have been made at the expense of the public?&quot;<br /><br />This makes me think of the oil companies, the banks, Haliburton, etc. that have all prospered while the average American citizen has been trampled on.<br /><br />It&#039;s amazing to me how history repeats itself and how, even 250 years ago, things really haven&#039;t changed when it comes to power struggles and government.

				I am really surprised at the amount of support that I see out of nowhere for him.&nbsp; He is struggling to get the word out to everyone, as I know a lot of people that have never heard of him.&nbsp; However, those that do hear his message are usually very impressed and become supporters.&nbsp; I am very active in an investment forum and there is strong support for him there, as well as some good support in the Firehouse Forums.<br /><br />My roommate is one of those people that came over to Dr. Paul&#039;s camp, and it was through nothing I said.&nbsp; He just heard about him, did his own research, and liked what he heard.<br /><br />If you guys haven&#039;t seen it and you have some time on your hands, I strongly recommend checking out his Candidates@Google Interview http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCM_wQy4YVg (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCM_wQy4YVg)&nbsp; It&#039;s 65 minutes long, but it&#039;s well worth it to learn more about his policies and where he&#039;s coming from.

				Ron Paul is hardly&nbsp; &#039;fresh&#039; or a&nbsp; &#039;change.&#039; He is&nbsp; a&nbsp; classic isolationist, and if this were say, the 19th century, maybe, he&#039;d be OK.

I also think it&#039;s unwise to think that a more isolationist foreign policy will somehow make the world love America again. It will actually make us more disliked, probably from the same quarters where we&#039;re regarded as a bully.<br /><br />But you know what? That&#039;s a risk I&#039;m willing to take. I&#039;d rather the US mind its own and piss off the world instead of getting into foreign entanglements with the same result.

				But, again, he&#039;s not pushing for us to be isolationist.&nbsp; He wants to be MUCH more open with nations diplomatically and economically (through trade and information sharing, not gratuitous aid and/or harsh sanctions) and remove ourselves from so many of our obligations; military or aid-based.&nbsp; This would mean that we stop funneling billions of dollars into Israel AND their enemy Egypt, of which both use to build up military strength to guard against/attack the other.&nbsp; It would mean we&#039;d stop sending money to future Saddams and Osamas while they are now our friends, yet tomorrow our enemies, to overthrow governments we don&#039;t like.<br /><br />His interest in getting out of NATO and the UN is because we spend HUGE amounts of money on these two organizations, plus we are getting more and more under their controls.&nbsp; Their laws can have effects on our policy; which takes away our sovereignty.&nbsp; Plus, we become obligated to act at the will of these organizations, much like we have asked other countries to do for us.&nbsp; But, why do we need that?&nbsp; If we&#039;re not being aggressive militarily or politically, why do we need to have other nations following our moves?<br /><br />Now, obviously, if we needed to go to war, our reasons were legitimate, AND IT WAS VOTED ON AND PASSED BY THE CONGRESS, then we can ask for assistance.&nbsp; The whole reason Bush was able to get the Iraq War going was because of UN Resolution 1441 and &quot;Iraq&#039;s failure to comply,&quot; not the vote of Congress (and, in turn, the people).&nbsp; <br /><br />If the assistance we ask for isn&#039;t given; screw them.&nbsp; Paul wants a strong military and it will be even stronger under his presidency because we won&#039;t have our soldiers all over the world.&nbsp; Do we really need to have our troops stationed in Japan and Germany for their protection; spending millions (or billions) of our tax dollars?&nbsp; Why can&#039;t they be given the task of protecting themselves?&nbsp; Are they gonna spring up a batch of new Hitlers and Hirohitos?&nbsp; Is someone going to jump on invading them once we leave?&nbsp; Is the Red Army going to rise up again and go rolling across Western Europe?&nbsp; <br /><br />We have tons of troops in South Korea as a deterrent to the North, but is it really OUR job to protect them with our American lives and tax dollars?&nbsp; If you say yes, then do you also believe that we should be in any of the troubled countries in Africa too?&nbsp; Which ones deserve our help and who gets cut out?&nbsp; We tried Somalia, but the &quot;reward&quot; wasn&#039;t worth the risk and loss of American lives to the public then and Clinton was forced to pull us out of there.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />It is THESE types of situations that Paul wants to get us out of; not the ones that are beneficial to the US.&nbsp; If that&#039;s what everyone wants to consider isolationist; sign me up as an isolationist.&nbsp; I don&#039;t, by any means, think that we should just blatantly allow suffering around the world; but there has to be a line drawn.&nbsp; Our situation in the US direly needs attention.&nbsp; What we spend just on our military and gratuitous aid activities OUTSIDE of this country would help bring our budget down, lower taxes, increase take home pay to families and help set up programs (private giving, not government) that can combat hunger, homelessness, or provide cheaper health care.<br /><br />That&#039;s what Dr. Paul wants to get this country doing and that&#039;s why I support him.&nbsp; If fixing things here by doing less in other countries gets that done, so be it.&nbsp; If you&#039;re going to say it sounds selfish, consider something you want (environmental protection, cheaper and cleaner energy, better public transportation, lower taxes, cheaper college, etc.) and REALLY question whether you want to continue to send your money to another country, or whether you&#039;d rather see it go to one of those things.&nbsp;

I agree&nbsp; Saudi&nbsp; Arabia&nbsp; is&nbsp; a horror, but, Iran is the immediate danger and attacking Saudi , which has islams holiest&nbsp; site, would get the war with Islam I thought we wanted&nbsp; to avoid. Let&#039;s&nbsp; take care of&nbsp; this nut first.<br /><br />Actually, from what I understand, Iranian women have a little more freedom than women in those countries.&nbsp; Now, before you take that wrong, I&#039;m not saying that they are treated well, but their treatment isn&#039;t as harsh.<br /><br />This is incorrect. Iran has imposed&nbsp; strict&nbsp; Sharia&nbsp; law now, an dunder thjis guys, routinely executes women for&nbsp; such &#039;crimes&#039;&nbsp; as being with a man alone&nbsp; and certainly any nuse of alcohol&nbsp; or being gay wil earn you everything from a lashing to a&nbsp; hanging. Yes, Saudi&nbsp; is&nbsp; harsh too, let&#039;s&nbsp; not take on the entire Islamic&nbsp; world&nbsp; at once.

You don&#039;t let in the enemy during a&nbsp; war.<br /><br />Of course they didn&#039;t.&nbsp; But are you saying that we weren&#039;t meddling in their affairs before then?&nbsp; I think running through Kuwait 10 years earlier didn&#039;t really help things.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure our support of Iraq during the Iraq-Iran war didn&#039;t make us any friends in Iran.&nbsp; Or, how about supporting the Taliban in the Afghani war vs. the Russians?&nbsp; Hell, how about the fact Iraq was arbitrarily slapped together in 1920 by the League of Nations.&nbsp;<br /><br />We were in Kuwait, cause&nbsp; Saddam had invaded. We didn&#039;t support Iraq or Iran during their war, we gave them just enough to kill each other, unfortunately, they both&nbsp; survived&nbsp; intact and&nbsp; then turned&nbsp; on us. Plus, the Ayatoliet, which we can thank France&nbsp; for &#039;saving&#039;, started&nbsp; the islamic revolution to overthrow the Shah, who even Iraninans&nbsp; who ahted him admit now was a million times better&nbsp; than what happened. We did not support the taliban, the Taliban did not exist till the Soviets&nbsp; left. We supported factions of the Muhjahadden, like&nbsp; the Soviets&nbsp; and Chinese&nbsp; supported the Vietcong and screwed&nbsp; us twenty years&nbsp; earlier.

				I neg-nodded in disagreement. Osama Bin Laden is hardly a fiction trumped up around 9/11; he&#039;s been a threat long before he became an infamously household name, and part of a dangerous collective that wants the world to turn back to the 7th Century.<br /><br />That&#039;s all well and good, but when his cultish followers start killing thousands of innocent civilians in pursuit of that goal, then it&#039;s a problem.

I said ...Well, they haven&#039;t rued the day. After 9/11, we should have laid waste&nbsp; on such a scale that&nbsp; their would be tens of millions dead, they would have done&nbsp; it to us in a second&nbsp; given half a chance. This is&nbsp; a&nbsp; planet of&nbsp; barabarians, with few exceptions, if we don&#039;t fight to preserve&nbsp; the exception we deserve&nbsp; to disappear.<br /><br />I was answering why they hadn&#039;t rued the day&nbsp; and what they would&nbsp; have done, if they&nbsp; had our power, I said we &#039;should have&#039;, we didn&#039;t we are&nbsp; not the kind of people I see being denounced daily and they enemy is being played down. This is why the uproar&nbsp; on the moderate&nbsp; steps&nbsp; taken, removing the Taliban and fulfilling the 12 year violated&nbsp; cease fire&nbsp; in Iraq was the minimum, is frustrating and mystfying to me.. <br /><br />My &#039;Tuchas&#039; have been to the Middle East, many times, both in service and out. Matter of fact, after 9/11 I tried&nbsp; to re-enlist and&nbsp; I was over the age, even after&nbsp; they raised&nbsp; it recently. I also tried&nbsp; getting into a security&nbsp; firm. But, this whole argument, If one supports a war they should all be there fighting it, while all war opponents&nbsp; are safely at home denouncing it, is the single most meanspirited&nbsp; argument of all. If I said one who supports national health care should move&nbsp; to Cuba, or&nbsp; if one supports&nbsp; fighting crime they should shut up&nbsp; and&nbsp; become a cop, I&#039;d be laughed at and for good reason. So, let&#039;s&nbsp; cut out that&nbsp; nonsense. I support cancer research, but, I&#039;d be a rotten surgeon. <br /><br />Ok, so, you called me a hater and&nbsp; bigot. I think it&#039;s&nbsp; a fair assumption you won&#039;t be inviting&nbsp; me&nbsp; to tea and cakes.&nbsp; I have&nbsp; friends and even some&nbsp; family who were in the IDF. When I see&nbsp; criticism only directed&nbsp; one way, while the other side&nbsp; I keep hearing how we did&nbsp; this or that to them and we should&nbsp; leave, to me it smacks&nbsp; of support. If I&#039;m in a&nbsp; fight and someone keeps telling me I am wrong and says&nbsp; nothing about the other side, I assume&nbsp; they are not supporting&nbsp; me and it is&nbsp; defacto&nbsp; support of my opponent. You can&#039;t be &#039;neutrally&#039; against&nbsp; one side.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;I lived with Muslims, in an exchange in a ARMYROTC program, for nearly 3 years. We ate, showered, sh*t and slept&nbsp; in close quarters.&nbsp; The Muslims I lived with were highly educated folks, we were studying Avionics and Hydraulics of high performance military aircraft. Anyway, a gentleman I became friends with from Jedda, Saudi Arabia... &#039;Mahood&#039;, explained to me the fanaticism of the coming Muslim &#039;Jihad&#039;, the Iran hostage situation had just ended and we were in Upstate NY at the time at Stewart Airport and saw the hostages land. We would have long talks, we both enjoyed playing soccer, and on the field after practice we would discuss the similarties, and their are numerous, of the Holy Bible and Holy Koran. There are great differences as well, and the sad part is that the Koran has gone back in time to reinforce things abandoned over the centuries, &#039;mistakes&#039; if you will, that Jews and then Christians visited on &#039;non-believers.&#039; Still, those Zealots, hundreds and even a thousand years ago did not have access to the weapons of today, thankfully, they only got as far as the sword and shield. &#039;Mahood&#039;, could not understand the complacency of the West at the hostage situation, then by former President Jimmy Carter, he reiterated that it emboldens the zealots when they see appeasment or pulling back from a fight. He told me on the last day of our ROTC graduation, that one day the Jihadists will attack your home if you do not stop them, that was in 1984. Mahood was and is a friend of mine, he and his parents still maintain a residence in Qatar, and he eventually worked as an interpretor for the British consulate. We exchanged a Bible/Koran that last day, and he told me how he would have to hide it in his nation, where &#039;Mecca&#039; the holiest site of Islam exist, I told him I can read his book anywhere, and that is the difference. The current war is a result of neglect due to&nbsp; convenience and appeasment for resources. Yes, it is partly cause of oil, but, not the West trying to grab it, but, the East using it to spread an ideology based on religious intolerance and ancient bigotry. If not now, when, if not us, who, someone once said, this has to be stopped now, otherwise, there will be further bloodshed and the war everyone claims they want to avoid will then be in your homes and unavoidable. 9/11 was their best shot yet, but, not the last one by far.<br /><br />There over a billion Muslims&nbsp; on earth. If we take the lowest polling that %10&nbsp; support&nbsp; Jihad and suicide bombing, and that fully&nbsp; 1/3 see it as duty to make Islam the law wherever they may be, that&#039;s&nbsp; between 100 and 300 Million people&nbsp; who want&nbsp; to end &#039;our&#039;&nbsp; way of life. <br />

				Saturday evening, my wife and I went to Ron Paul&#039;s grass roots headquarters for a celebration leading up to today&#039;s &quot;Boston Tea Party&quot; fund-raising drive (currently they&#039;re approaching $4 million dollars donated today!).<br /><br />Although I recognized a few classical liberals in the crowd of approximately 170+ people, mostly this was a youthful group who are clearly passionate about his candidacy primarily because they trust that Paul is a principled statesman.

Why should that be the case?<br /><br />Some leaders have a principled basis for their policy positions.

				Kudos.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t have said it better.&nbsp; I don&#039;t agree with EVERYTHING Paul says and stands for as it is next to impossible to agree with everything that someone else does.<br /><br />However, I agree with WAY more of what he says than I do ANY of the other candidates.&nbsp; His sincerity in, as you pointed out, HELPING the American people over just gaining power and handing things out without regard to the future consequences is a million times greater than the others.<br /><br />I hope he wins for the people that DON&#039;T understand the trouble we&#039;re in and that think a government just handing out bandaids to fix this mess is going to be enough.&nbsp; I fear for the country if we keep continuing down this path of materialism, aggression, and debt.

Marxist, maybe, Castroites, probably, Leftists, definately. No matter who &#039;owns&#039; media&nbsp; companies, the vast majority only care if it makes&nbsp; money, or adds &#039;prestige&#039; to their&nbsp; portfolio. The &#039;product&#039; they receive&nbsp; from Journalism schools is decidely&nbsp; leftists. BTW, Michael Savage&nbsp; was&nbsp; fired&nbsp; by MSNBC faster&nbsp; than Donohue. I don&#039;t see&nbsp; how Glen Beck is&nbsp; a racist, but, I&#039;m sure&nbsp; you&#039;ll tell me. The guy is&nbsp; a &#039;pussycat&#039;, reminds me of &#039;token&#039;&nbsp; conservative Scharboro on MSNBC who once said the entire&nbsp; staff&nbsp; of MSNBC was booing Bush&nbsp; during&nbsp; a&nbsp; 2004 speech. yeah, media&nbsp; is&nbsp; rife with &#039;right-wing&#039;&nbsp; zealots.&nbsp; :roll:<br /><br />Bill Moyers and his comrade Soros, Bill sits on the board of Soros’ Open Society Institute, Moyers is president of the Florence and John Schumann Foundation, from which position he funds both the respectable and the radical Left.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />Soros’ Billions created Americans Coming Together from nothing, Moyers steered Schumann Foundation money into an obscure journal known as The American Prospect. Once a tiny bimonthly academic journal, Moyers turned loose the foundation’s spigots and flooded TAP with pledges of nearly $11 million. It was a $5.5 million grant in 1999 that transformed TAP from an academic journal to a biweekly newsstand publication meant to rival National Review. The Ford Foundation similarly gave TAP a $600,000 grant. Although Schumann money conferred respectability upon this publication, TAP maintains connections to the radical Left. The Prospect ’s Editor-at-Large, Harold Meyerson, is a Vice-Chair of the Democratic Socialists of America; DSA chairs include Barbara Ehrenreich, Cornel West, Gloria Steinem and Delores Huerta. TAP founders include Robert Kuttner and diminutive Clinton Labor Secretary Robert Reich.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&#039;Sept. 11 Families Disgusted By Bush Campaign Ads;Bush Ads Using 9/11 Images Stir Anger;Bush Exploiting 9/11;&#039; and &#039;Has Bush No Shame?&#039; Just&nbsp; some of the esitmated&nbsp; %85&nbsp; of negative&nbsp; headlines&nbsp; on nightly news, newspapers across the country, during the 2004&nbsp; campaign. No doubt, the five guys on radio, a medium, the left ignored, cause as you say, they once controlled every paper in NY, including the NY Post. Of course, in those days, the Left still had sane people in it, so there was no need to have another voice. Of cpurse PBS, had lone voice&nbsp; Bill Buckley in those&nbsp; days. <br /><br />Anyway, the above controversy arose from Bush’s presidential ad campaign, which depicts brief images of the World Trade Center after the tragedy of 9/11. Colleen Kelly, who lost her brother Bill Kelly Jr. in the attacks on September 11th, told reporters, &#039;I am afraid these ads, and others to follow, will be part of an ugly political jousting match between candidates, where one side attacks the other as somehow indifferent to the horrors of the day. President Bush can responsibly promote his ideas for confronting our threat from terrorism without overwhelming people with the very sacred images of our loved ones’ murders.&#039; Kelly continued, &#039;It makes me sick. Would you ever go to someone&#039;s gravesite and use that as an instrument of politics?&#039; What Kelly did not tell the media is that she is the New York area coordinator for a group called September Eleventh Families For Peaceful Tomorrows. Peering under the veil of this media outbreak aimed at condemning the ads is this organization and a longtime leftist activist named David Fenton. The irony of Kelly’s remarks is that Peaceful Tomorrows is precisely an &#039;instrument of politics.&#039;<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;Foundations, the vast majority from the NorthEast leftist&nbsp; establishment have poured billions&nbsp; since the 1930&#039;s into radio, getting Govt. grants, and really took off after the 1960&#039;s, creating a media&nbsp; matrix, that any major organization of news has to use their resources&nbsp; for news. Example..one of hundreds..Peaceful Tomorrows; which is coordinated by leftwing public relations specialist David Fenton, and funded by the left grant-giving Tides Foundation is an antiwar support organization founded by individuals who lost loved ones in the terrorist attacks of September 11th. To date, Peaceful Tomorrows is comprised of 120 family members of 9/11 victims, as well as supporters and volunteers ranging in the thousands. Formed as a supposedly nonpartisan group opposing the War on Terror, Peaceful Tomorrows has taken its message across the country and around the world, with members of the group speaking at universities, participating in the antiwar marches in Washington, D.C., and taking to the airwaves whenever a media occasion arises. Their founding mission is to &#039;break the cycle of violence and retaliation engendered by war.&#039; However, their focus&nbsp; has shifted from protesting the War on Terror, to supporting Chavez and the recent visit&nbsp; of Irans Myheadsinajam. a holocaust denier and vicious racist leader.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Added to their lengthy résumé, which includes participating in the No More Victims Tour, the Not In Our Name rally and a series of other antiwar demonstrations, Peaceful Tomorrows is the recipient of funding from the Tides Center, which is dually funded by the Vira Heinz Endowment and the Howard Heinz Endowment – chaired by Teresa Heinz Kerry.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />According to a report in the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review , John Kerry’s wife, Teresa, channeled endowments in the millions into the parent foundation that supports Peaceful Tomorrows. Between 1995 and 2001, $4.3 million of that money given to Tides came from the Howard Heinz Endowment, the report states. In 2002, it and the Vira Heinz Endowment blessed The Tides Center, a San Francisco spin-off of the Tides Foundation, with another $190,000 while the two endowments gave $1.6 million to the new Tides Center for Western Pennsylvania. A statement released by Peaceful Tomorrows last week reads, Peaceful Tomorrows has no connection with the Heinz or Kerry families through Tides Foundation, the Tides Center or any other entity.This is blatantly contradictory to their own website, which informs donators, Contributions by check can be made out to &#039;Peaceful Tomorrows/Tides Center. The mainstream media has conveniently ignored this link in their coverage of the group.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Tides Foundation itself is just another foundation in a lengthy line of&nbsp; grant-giving groups that finance far-left causes and organizations, with agendas ranging from driving President Bush out of office to promoting policies which would make it easier for terrorists to enter the country. Their recipients include such notables as: the Institute for Global Communications, a far-Left Internet propaganda dissemination machine; and the Independent Media Center, which served as a conduit for the planning phase of the antiwar protests last year. Tides also provides support to Islamic Networks, Inc. – a public relations institute whose aim is to convince Americans that Islam doesn&#039;t oppress women, despite the evidence to the contrary. In addition, Tides funds the Democratic Justice Fund, founded in cooperation with George Soros’ Open Society Institute. The goal of the fund is to support Muslim and Arabic political groups that sponsor policies granting Muslim terrorists easier access to the United States. Also receiving grants from Tides are such bigwigs as various chapters of the ACLU and The National Lawyers Guild, and such relative newcomers as MoveOn.org, which has compared our Commander-in-Chief to Hitler.<br /><br />Heading up the direction of Peaceful Tomorrows’ media blitz is David Fenton. Fenton has had his hands in all things big and small with regards to the media campaigns of some of the aforementioned liberal activist groups. Fenton had a humble start as a high school dropout and 60’s radical/anti-war protestor. He began his &#039;journalism&#039; career as a photographer and media specialist for the Liberation News Service, which was named in admiration of and loyalty to the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. The anti-American, Communist movement Fenton and his colleagues emulated called for the overthrow of the camouflaged colonial regime of the American imperialists and the dictatorial power of Ngo Dinh Diem, servant of the Americans, and to&nbsp; institute a government of national democratic union in Vietnam.<br /><br />Aside from simply covering various aspects of the counter-culture and anti-war movements, Fenton and his Liberation News Service associates, headed by Allen Young and George Cavalletto, were sympathetic to the radical anti-establishment organization Students for a Democratic Society, and set out to run their own group with the goal of effecting political change to the tune of their overtly Marxist philosophy. Fenton’s political ideology, as well, found him as a member of the White Panther Party, the Caucasian counterpart of the infamous Black Panthers. In the 60’s and early 70’s, Fenton also snapped photographs for the Weathermen, a Communist-driven splinter faction of Students for a Democratic Society, whose anarchistic national views led to their bombing of the National Guard offices in Washington, D.C., the U.S. Capitol building, the New York City Police Headquarters and the Pentagon.<br /><br />The latter 70’s saw Fenton’s foray into the anti-nuclear movement. His left-wing work throughout the decade culminated in his orchestration of the famous “No Nukes” concerts, which were headlined by performers Bruce Springsteen and Bonnie Raitt. The Western “disarmament” movement, of course, was a favorite ploy of the Soviet Union.<br /><br />By the time the 1980’s rolled around, Fenton was a hot commodity. He was recruited to shape and mold the public perceptions of Communist-led governments and Marxist guerillas alike. The year 1986 found Fenton in the throes of the Communist-led Angolan government’s Bureau of Information and Propaganda. He was hired to sully the reputation of a right-wing rebel group that the Angolan Communists had been fighting against for years. Fenton did similar public relations work for Nicaragua&#039;s Sandinistas. The Communist-backed Sandinistas regarded themselves as integral to a proletariat revolution in Nicaragua. To this end, Fenton provided necessary guidance in the public relations department in an effort to sway favorable opinion about this Marxist faction. Rounding off his Communist ties, Fenton conducted media services for Grenada’s Prime Minister, Maurice Bishop. Bishop was a staunch supporter of Fidel Castro and his Marxist government in Cuba, and sought to repeat that government’s philosophy in his own homeland. All Fenton’s work was for naught; the U.S. invasion of Granada in 1983 toppled Bishop’s Marxist regime.<br /><br />For the past 20 years, Fenton and his company, Fenton Communications, has been largely preoccupied with creating media strategies for left-wing groups, including one of his primary clients, Environmental Media Services. When you hear dire warnings not to consume a certain food or because of a dangerous additive or preservative – it’s Environmental Media Services shouting the warning. In reality, Fenton’s group leaks environmentally questionable hyperbole to the news media concerning the dangers of certain products to bolster increased revenue for his other clients. This strategy has found Fenton attacking everything from biogenetic foods to the nation’s dairy industry.<br /><br />The anti-biogenetic message, which claims that genetically engineered foods are dangerous to eat, has made millions for Fenton’s clients, which include such health food producers as: Whole Foods Markets, Honest Tea, Kashi Cereal, Green Mountain Coffee, and Rodale Press, which is a magazine publisher that puts out a series of periodicals concerning organic gardening and foods. Fenton has made millions for his patrons off of the misguided belief that organic foods are healthier than conventional or biotech products. Just because something is labeled as organic,noted former USDA Secretary Dan Glickman, that does not mean it is superior, safer, or more healthy than conventional food.”<br /><br />This approach has also worked in favor of ice cream producers Ben &amp; Jerry’s, another client of Fenton’s. Starting with a series of press conferences in the late 90’s, Environmental Media Services pushed the message that a hormone given to dairy cows to produce milk could cause cancer, despite the FDA having shown the hormone to be safe. Ben &amp; Jerry’s ice cream stood to gain from the bad press aimed at the dairy industry because their ice cream is made with hormone-free milk.<br /><br />Fenton’s crowning achievement was his 1989 attack against the producers of Alar, a preservative used on apples that was also erroneously reported to cause cancer. The results fed to the news media about the product were completely fabricated, having never been scientifically tested, but nonetheless triggered mass hysteria and caused the apple industry to lose over $200 million in revenue. Later, in a memo uncovered by the Wall Street Journal, Fenton bragged, We designed the campaign against Alar so that revenue would flow back to the Natural Resources Defense Council from the public.The Natural Resources Defense Council was another one of Fenton’s primary clients. <br /><br />In recent years, Fenton has expanded out from his health food and Communist clientele, and now includes antiwar and anti-Bush groups in his sizable and growing repertoire. Trevor S. Fitzgibbon, Director of Media Relations for Fenton Communications, assists in the public relations strategy for MoveOn.org, MoveOn.org Voter Fund, and Win Without War. According to Fenton Communications, Fitzgibbon’s messaging and PR efforts on behalf of MoveOn.org have helped position the online advocacy group as a national political force in American life. Arlie Schardt, a senior consultant at Fenton Communications and chairman for Environmental Media Services, served as Al Gore’s national press secretary during his first presidential campaign. Fenton’s recent addition of Peaceful Tomorrows to his list of clients marks yet another notch in his political bedpost, despite the claims of its members to be nonpartisan. With Peaceful Tomorrows’ members inundating the newspapers and television programs bashing the President’s campaign ad; as member Robert McIlvane did, proclaiming, I am outraged at the Republicans for doing this, it’s obvious that Fenton’s doing his job.<br /><br />Peaceful Tomorrows, The Tides Foundation, and David Fenton, is surely a deception, with a faux nonpartisan group coordinated by a public relations firm and indirectly funded by a presidential hopeful, both with convictions leaning well left-of-center. Making mountains out of molehills is Fenton’s game, and turning them into mountains of money and publicity for his clients, whether they’re for-profit or for politics. The Tides Foundation is also good at their game, which consists of funding groups that seem to walk a fine line between advocating a cause and advocating a presidential candidate. Topping off this list of great game players is Teresa Heinz Kerry, who, despite the illegality of financing her husband’s presidential campaign herself, has found a way of funding groups that promote his presidential plans.<br /><br />I just cited&nbsp; these&nbsp; few examples. As for Kerry, many vets, who were&nbsp; still there&nbsp; when&nbsp; John was&nbsp; safely at home denouncing them as&nbsp; murderers, were naturally angry at him using his service&nbsp; as &#039;heroic.&#039;&nbsp; At least&nbsp; Bush, and others, who, BTW, was called up much later than Kerry when the War was&nbsp; not as &#039;popular&#039; as when Kerry first went in, and they spoke up when he ran for&nbsp; President. You cite, 8 stations&nbsp; in the south who refused&nbsp; to run a program out of hundreds and thousands, but, the thousands&nbsp; pounding daily from the left, mostly centered&nbsp; and, more important, staffed&nbsp; and indoctrinated for&nbsp; decades, are far more&nbsp; powerful. I could go on alot longer than you, and there in lies my proof of who controls the&nbsp; media.

				<br />The debates this evening had a photo op with candidates from both major parties together.<br />It was interesting to hear the GOP candidates discuss Obama.<br /><br /><br />The debate was the best and best format that I have seen.<br /><br /><br />I thought Ron Paul had some real low moments and some high ones.<br />While many look like they could be good VP, can our country really accept another 4 years of war Iraq? I am sure others would say can we &quot;afford&quot; not to.<br /><br /><br />I had hoped that Dr. Paul would have done better than 10% in Iowa. Already, Romney is gaining a lead in delegates that might be difficult to maintain.<br />Ron Paul really needs to do quite well in NH to really justify a campaign beyond Feb. 5. I hope there would be good reasons still to vote for his candidacy when NY votes.<br /><br />Hoping for Hope.

				Saturday&#039;s debates were fundamentally fooked. First of all, all the political punditry at half time and at the end of the debate really focused on the major rivalrys. Very little mention of the other candidates. I thought that was weak on ABC.. Also, why did they not let Kucinich in? He would have had an instant vote from me if he just walked on stage and laid the smack down to Charlie Gibson.<br /><br />Other than that, I thought it was great to have both parties back to back!

				He did pretty well in the debate last night, except for him getting confused after talking about the Iranian speed boat threat.&nbsp; The moderator even was going after him.&nbsp; Paul bungled it a bit, but his point made sense.<br /><br />Of course, since it was &quot;Fair and Balanced&quot; Fox News, they had a panel at the end that all thought Paul lost the debate.<br /><br />I really don&#039;t understand it.&nbsp; Sure, Paul may be &quot;out there&quot; for some of the mainstream, how can so many people eat the BS that these other candidates put out?&nbsp; Huckabee talked a few times about cutting taxes as governor, yet the moderator called him out on the fact that he increased taxes the whole time he was in office.<br /><br />How do people not see the lies and double-talk?

				Paul frequently speaks over people&#039;s heads. When I hear him invoke Austrian economics, I am simultaneously <strong>thrilled</strong>, imagining people googling Menger, Bohm-Bawerk, von Mises, Hayek, and <strong>horrified</strong>, imagining the vast majority of people wondering what the hell he&#039;s talking about.<br /><br />He has his moments, but he rarely speaks to people&#039;s gut-level fears, their coalitional identities, and, of course he has no interest in talking to them about free lunch promises. These are the three areas in which the other candidates of both parties comfortably cohabitate. Who among the Democrats is arguing for a new philosophy of governance? None of them. It&#039;s all about to what degree they will expand government, not whether, perhaps, it&#039;s time for Democrats to stop worshiping the cult of the omnipotent state.<br /><br />The Republicans are the same way, except for Paul. Frankly, without Paul, the entire conversation in the Republican Party would be boring. I hope Paul stays in until he runs out of money, fighting in every primary up until the end. Frankly, the country needs to hear his ideas. There are still some people who aren&#039;t really paying attention to politics, believe it or not, and the longer he stays in this thing, the more people will be exposed to his perspective. The campaign has always acknowledged that it is operating on two fronts, the political race and the cultural/intellectual competition. <br /><br />I disagree with Paul&#039;s stance on abortion, but I agree with him that the government should not allocate tax dollars to fund abortions. <br /><br />I disagree with him, sort of, about immigration, because I *know* that he would advocate a far more open approach to legal immigration, however he keeps thumping his chest about illegal immigration in a way that I find upsetting. To my way of thinking it is absolutely immoral to consider that a person should have to endure restrictions on their capacity to lead a happy and peaceful life simply because they happened to be born in one place as opposed to another. Although illegal immigration may be against current laws technically, there is something called &quot;the rule of law&quot;, which is the principle some laws are valid and others are not based on how those laws relate to individual liberty. Slavery was technically legal, but was a violation of the rule of law. Given the case of a person who lives in one region of the world, finds it unbearable or tolerable but not as good as it might be if he/she moved elsewhere, then moves to a place where he/she engages in peaceful, voluntary contracts with other people, I consider it completely inappropriate for any government to put up any obstacles to such behavior.<br /><br />Paul talks about how some illegal immigrants make use of publicly subsidized programs at taxpayers&#039; expense. But the problem isn&#039;t that illegal immigrants become a burden to our welfare state. The problem is the existence of the welfare state in the first place, regardless of whether the people using it are native born Americans or people from abroad. Paul knows this, of course, but I feel he overemphasizes his opposition to illegal immigration and underemphasizes his advocacy of open immigration.<br /><br />Forget about graceful exits. I want him to stay until the bloody end and continue to expose the Republican Party for what it has has become: a big government party with a hugely powerful, big spending coalition of big businesses who looooove their pork.

They are nearly alone in asking this question. Even conservatives claim a great concern for equality of opportunity, while opposing opportunity of result. And the reasons seem obvious: some degree of material equality as a necessary basis for political equality; the huge role of luck in getting each of us to our relative stations in life; etc. <br /><br />But nothing like this is obvious to libertarians.

				&nbsp;:mrgreen:<br /><br /><br />Former Republican governor of New Mexico<br /><br />&nbsp;“I am endorsing Ron Paul for the Republican nomination for president because of his commitment to less government, greater liberty, and lasting prosperity for America. We are at a point in this country where we need to reduce our dependency on government and regain control of our future. To this end, Ron Paul will bring back troops, end the War in Iraq, and will strengthen the U.S. dollar and the economy. For these reasons and more, Ron Paul has my support, respect, and vote.”<br /><br /><br />&#039;Gary Johnson was governor of New Mexico from 1995 to 2003. <br /><br /><br />Like Ron Paul, he is a drug-war skeptic.&#039;<br />&nbsp;:?

				<br />Some Observations on Four Terms in Congress<br /><br /><br />Before the US House of Representatives, September 19, 1984<br /><br />Mr. Speaker, <br />…<br /><br />The most I can hope for is that someday a suggestion I&#039;ve made is remembered: that the debate would shift to a different plane. <br />Instead of asking which form of intervention and planning government should impose, perhaps someday Congress will debate intervention versus nonintervention, government versus voluntary planning, U.S. sovereignty versus internationalism – the pros and cons of true liberty. <br />Today the debate basically is only that of deciding who will be the victims and who the beneficiaries. <br />I hope the hours of debate over the mechanisms of the political system orchestrated by the special interests will give way to this more important debate on freedom. The lack of this debate was my greatest disappointment. <br />...<br />Something has to give – we must choose either freedom and prosperity or tyranny and poverty.<br /><br /><br /><br />September 19, 1984<br />Dr. Ron Paul is a Republican member of Congress from Texas.<br />&nbsp;:mrgreen:<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;:|

This has unfortunate consequences for Paul&#039;s candidacy.&nbsp; :cry:<br /><br />1. McCain really doesn&#039;t need to participate in any more debates and I doubt his &quot;sense of honor&quot; will require him to. He has basically won the Republican nomination for president today, so why debate with Huckabee, let alone Paul?&nbsp; :-(&nbsp; McCain. Holy crap. :cry:<br /><br />2. Paul&#039;s puny delegate count isn&#039;t going to be sought after as it might have been in a close contest between Romney and McCain. Would have been nice if he could swing the nomination result (play kingmaker) in return for firm commitments to enact some of his policy recommendations. This is so clearly not going to happen.&nbsp; :|<br /><br />3. Steadily, Paul&#039;s focus will turn to his local race. Discussion of individual liberty, rolling back entitlement programs and the welfare state, and decreasing taxes will essentially disappear from the national political stage. :cry:&nbsp; Hillabama&#039;s unrepentant socialism versus McCain&#039;s slippery pragmatism. He&#039;s dead meat. The voters want their free lunches and they want them now!&nbsp; :roll:<br /><br />And if I was confident that a Democrat was going to win in the Fall, I&#039;ve now reached the level just below metaphysical certitude. As in, the nature of the universe is such that a Democrat will probably win in November. The only thing that gives me pause is that if Hillary is the Democratic nominee, her lust for power may become so great as she approaches actually having it that its density could cause her to implode, turning her into something like a pulsar. Even in the form of a pulsar, she might still win, but it would be harder.&nbsp; 8-)<br /><br />***<br /><br />Do you like your socialism snarling (Hillary) or smiling (Barak)?&nbsp; :lol:<br /><br />And that&#039;s likely to mean that this country is in store for a strong dose of fascism the likes of which it has never known.

Certainly, this tendency characterizes the trend in health care (i.e., from HMOs to Hillary&#039;s or Obama&#039;s &quot;universal&quot; health care proposals). The government role is increasing, the costs are getting higher, and doctors and patients are pushed farther away from one another. <br /><br />Hillary is seriously talking about the national government &quot;mandating&quot; that citizens have health insurance. So we&#039;re clear, the issue is not whether it is a good idea for people to have health insurance, but rather, is it a good idea to have the national government FORCE people to have health insurance. Of course, once you accept that the national government has the right to force people to have one thing, what would be the basis for limiting the government from forcing us to have other things?

It seems to get easier and easier for government to force us to do things, easier and easier for each of us to be found to be breaking one law or another. <br /><br />Hillary pays for her plan by &quot;mandating&quot; that large employers provide health insurance/help pay for it. You know what that means, right. It means products and services will be more expensive. Any new taxes on businesses are passed along to you and me through prices. Hillary&#039;s law would be the primary cause of the our cost of living increasing. Over time, policies like this make businesses, large and small, question whether they want to expand their businesses here. Don&#039;t worry, politicians will offer them subsidies or tax abatements to stay, and you and I will end up paying the difference once again.

This is a terrifying proposal. Not merely because of the impact of socialized medicine on the quality and availability of care, but also because of demographic realities this country faces. I&#039;m referring to the retiring baby boomers who are not millionaires like Bill and Hillary, the huge number of people over the age of sixty who will be especially vulnerable in a socialist health care system, where the tragedy of the commons quickly results in the government having to reign in costs by imposing absolute limits (quotas) on the accessibility of life-saving procedures, leading to waiting lists and unnecessary suffering and death.<br /><br />Of course, Hillary and her friends won&#039;t be affected in the same way because she and Bill have amassed a fortune as well as the political pull that comes in so handy when the government is deciding who gets care and when.

So if god forbid you should get hit by a car tomorrow, you can count on being in debt the rest of your life and no chance to really ever get back on your feet financially.&nbsp; So yeah, I think there are certain &quot;entitlement&quot; programs that should be in place to protect people.

From what I&#039;ve read about HSAs, you can&#039;t have it on your own, your employer has to offer it, so you&#039;re at the mercy of having a lucky employer. I have an FSA through my employer, which doesn&#039;t allow me to carry over any money accumulated from year to year, and it&#039;s not very easy to predict how much care you&#039;ll need, so you&#039;re either spending it on extra advil or having to pay out of pocket for extras anyway. It would be nice to have the option of simply having an HSA and other insurance options out there that are not mandated or run by the govt. and that are more than just catastrophic plans for the typical family. Right now, it probably costs me more money to pay for my health insurance through the company, my own and company contributions, than it does to simply pay our regular doctors fees for their services, labwork, general check-ups and all. I might decide to &quot;get off the grid,&quot; and find alternate ways of paying if the choices become slim.
