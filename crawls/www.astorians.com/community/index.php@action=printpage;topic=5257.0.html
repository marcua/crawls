				** whenever I see the byline for Kalan, I expect to be smiling that day. Looking to find his recent masterpiece. **&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;:lol:&nbsp; &nbsp;:?&nbsp; &nbsp;:-D<br /><br /><br />A bigger, badder budget<br />my view by elliott kalan<br />FEB 9<br /><br />The president unveiled his new budget this week, saying he’ll spend $2.9 trillion, a number so large you may not be able to hold it in your mind without blacking out. And I know what you’ll say when you wake up: “Why’s the president spending so much of our money? I can live off less, and so should he!” Remember, however, that this isn’t the president’s personal allowance, but the budget for our entire country, which is a pretty expensive place. The military alone needs more than $600 million for such necessary expenses as cold sandwich luncheons, office stationery and killing massive amounts of people. But even if the president wanted to save dollars by clipping coupons and buying in bulk, which he doesn’t, the Constitution says he can’t. <br /><br />Our founding fathers were many things: visionaries, patriots, heroes. But at heart, they were basically a bunch of crazy old men. And so the Constitution is stuffed with thousands of eccentric provisions better suited for a wealthy uncle’s will or a game show for children. This is why ducks can vote, <strong><span class="bbc_u">why Supreme Court appointments are decided by scavenger hunt</span> </strong> and why every congressman must spend a night in a haunted mansion. <br /><br />The most important of these laws stipulates that if the president empties America’s treasury by the end of each year, he wins a $10 million grand prize. If he fails to spend every last government dollar, then he will be burned at the stake. If this sounds familiar, it is because the movie “Brewster’s Millions” was loosely based on Woodrow Wilson’s 1913 budget (though they removed Wilson’s unfortunate death by stake-burning). <br /><br />President Bush, a child of wealth, has always been a natural overspender. Though his tax refund plan was judged by Congress to be “giving the money away,” and thus against the rules, he rebounded beautifully with the Iraq war, which will safely keep us in debt through the end of his term and beyond. Future presidents will have a hard time raising the bar further. Sure, the contenders for 2008 have their own ideas (Barack Obama promises to invest in a failing major league baseball club), but they’d do themselves a favor by watching our current leader’s moves. Even at the end of his presidency, he can still dazzle us with astounding new ways to waste money. He may well go down in history as our nation’s greatest spender-in-chief.<br /><br />***<br />Friday, September 15, 2006 <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Metro Column Today! <br />Yikes! When was the last time I added a link to one of these, huh? Well, I&#039;m very busy. And also forget that I have a MySpace page. And I was on the run from the CIA. So there.<br /><br />http://ny.metro.us/metro/blog/my_view/entry/Secret_CIA_prisons_So_totally_uncool/4499.html<br /><br />Now that the whole CIA thing has been cleared up (turns out the Assistant Director for Investigative Technology was in league with agents of S.P.Y.D.O.R., but I fixed that with some help from leggy Secret Service Operative Mandy Handler), I&#039;m hoping to link to the articles you&#039;ve missed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />http://ny.metro.us/metro/blog/my_view/
