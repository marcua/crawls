				Hi,<br /><br />I&#039;m trying to find a studio in the coming months, preferably in Astoria. I currently live in a shared converted 1br student apartment in the city so I don&#039;t have a car. If I do get an apartment in Astoria do you think that I would have to have a car, or can I remain a pedestrian?

				Not only can you remain pedestrian, you will be happier for it. I have a car and the parking situation is enough to engage in self-mutilation. However, I think it does depend on where in Astoria, and where you need to get to on a regular basis.

				As long as you can find an apartment in Astoria that is within a 10 minute walking distance to the train, you should be fine without a car.&nbsp; It&#039;s certainly not a necessity here.&nbsp; The subway runs the same as in Manhattan, 24 hours a day.&nbsp; There are of course, areas of Astoria in which you would need a car.&nbsp; But unless you are going to be working in Queens, and do not foresee going into Manhattan much at all, then I would not move to those areas.

				That&#039;s great! Thanks so much for responding<br /><br /><br />Honestly I don&#039;t know the area very well, but I like what I&#039;ve seen from walking around in search for a new place- I would like a place that&#039;s not too far from the city-since my hours range from pretty early-pretty late. What areas would you recommend? I will still be going to school in Manhattan daily

				Pretty much all of Astoria is convenient to Manhattan as along as you stay within walking distance of the subway. 36th Avenue is three stops from&nbsp; the 59th and Lexington Station in Manhattan, Broadway is four stops, 30th Avenue five stops, Astoria Blvd six stops and Ditmars is seven stops. All from the N/W train. <br /><br />Steinway street is I believe 4 stops to 59th and Lexington Ave. (though I could be wrong- hardly ever ride the R train).<br /><br />Are you looking for a more quiet type of neighborhood- or a more bustling type of neighborhood? That would give us a better idea of what you are looking for. <br /><br />

				no car needed. though if you ever want one find a quiet corner of town like &#039;astoria heights&#039; or by the river and do it. <br /><br />I have a car and love it. If I don&#039;t get a spot in front of my house I get mad. But I use is mostly to escape on weekends and live where it&#039;s not too densely populated...

I&#039;m at 21st Ave &amp; Steinway, and its not bad, I usually get a spot right out front.

				They won&#039;t let you take your dog on the train?&nbsp; Even with a carrier?&nbsp; Is he a really big dog or something?&nbsp; That doesn&#039;t seem right to me, I see people take dogs on the subway all the time.

				I couldnt imagine not having my car even if i lived in midtown manhattan, but certainly you dont need one in Astoria to get around.&nbsp; I dont get how people can ask for $175 or even $200 for a parking spot to rent, that&#039;s crazy!&nbsp; I find that alternate side of the street is not bad in ditmars area, though it does suck having to move the car around here and there.

				For me, driving is something I LOVE so I will always have a car.&nbsp; Yeah it definitely helps because there is no way I could lug around 50 lbs turntable cases plus record flight cases, cd books, mixer, cd decks and all other fun dj equipment that i have to take to gigs sometimes.&nbsp; I also like to get away and get some fresh air outside of the city, the convenience of going anywhere and everywhere, especially hoping in my car at night to come back to astoria from manhattan as opposed to trekking it on the subway at an ungodly hour with all the others doing the same ya dig Lol!<br /><br />
