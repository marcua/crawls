			 I&#039;m SJM&#039;50. Recently relocated back to NY after 20 years living in Florida. Work in IT and live in Astoria. Just bored and aimless. Going to Secret Theater, 44-02 23 street, LIC on Monday night, at 8pm. Never been there, but Tickets are only $5, and it&#039;s good enough reason to walk after work from Broadway in Astoria to explore. Lets get together and meet along the way?<br />Also hoping to meet new normal and spiritually healthy long term friends and neighbors...<br />Please txt me when you can:<br />facebook.com/golembo
