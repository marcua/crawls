				How is it that Astoria is represented in the state senate by Onorato, who today has alligned himself with the Democrat subgroup typified by Monserrate and Ruben Diaz, Sr.?&nbsp; They are the minority of Democrats who voted against Marriage Equality today, along with ALL of the Republicans.<br /><br />Why is Astoria represented by this person?

				I called the Albany office as the debate was going on and spoke with a very friendly lady who took down my address for a response.&nbsp; So disappointed to be represented by someone who doesn&#039;t share my views on this and I was actually relieved to see that other Astorians are so pissed off.&nbsp; I would like to hear an explanation of why he voted the way he did but from what I read only Diaz spoke when explaining his opposition -- all the other nays were silent.

				Onorato was a good old-school labor guy, watched the interests of the working folks.&nbsp; Surely it is possible to find good candidates in this district who can maintain those priorities while protecting a woman&#039;s right to choice, and commitment to civil rights and equality.
