				I went jogging the other night in Astoria Park and noticed a new - not yet open - bakery at Astoria Blvd and 14th St.&nbsp; It has been under construction for quite some time (at least a year or two) but now the paper is off the windows and it looks to be fully equipped/furnished and nearly ready to open.&nbsp; The name on the glass is Astor Bakery. It looks like it will be a great addition to that area as there is not much around there.&nbsp; Hopefully they will be able to survive as there doesn’t seem to be a lot of foot traffic in that area. <br /><br />Anyone know anything about this place?&nbsp; <br /><br />Here is a link to the location on google maps http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=astoria+blvd+and+14th+st,+astoria&amp;sll=40.772218,-73.928783&amp;sspn=0.000957,0.001719&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Astoria+Blvd+%26+14th+St,+Queens,+New+York+11102&amp;ll=40.777243,-73.928912&amp;spn=0,0.013754&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=40.772138,-73.928922&amp;panoid=r4U33iaF6brtBXELvMrWKQ&amp;cbp=12,325.53,,0,-6.47 (http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=astoria+blvd+and+14th+st,+astoria&amp;sll=40.772218,-73.928783&amp;sspn=0.000957,0.001719&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Astoria+Blvd+%26+14th+St,+Queens,+New+York+11102&amp;ll=40.777243,-73.928912&amp;spn=0,0.013754&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=40.772138,-73.928922&amp;panoid=r4U33iaF6brtBXELvMrWKQ&amp;cbp=12,325.53,,0,-6.47)

				Hi, <br />I&#039;m George, the owner of Astor Bake Shop. I&#039;ve had the space leased since 02/09, and have been physically working on it since 09/09. It does however feel like much longer. Hopefully the bulk of our delays are behind us and we&#039;ll be opening before the end of the month. I&#039;ve been a NYC pastry chef for 20+ years and finally decided to bring my passion for good food and desserts to Astoria. Besides some really good pastries, we&#039;re going to be offering a nice selection of chef inspired sandwiches, burgers and salads. Once we get our liquor license wine and beer will be added to the evening and brunch menus.<br />Though we&#039;re not yet open. if your passing by feel free to stop in and say hello. <br /><br />Hope to serve you soon,<br /><br />George

				Stumptown is very tasty - some of the best coffee I&#039;ve had.&nbsp; I do like Dallis, though - we drink their 5 borough blend and have been very happy with it.&nbsp; And it&#039;s roasted here in Queens!<br /><br />Looking forward to checking out Astor Bakery when it&#039;s open!

				I&#039;m glad you asked because I&#039;m very excited about our choice of coffee roasters. After a long search I came upon a micro roaster in Red Hook, Brooklyn (though I&#039;d love to use a Queens company, Dallas coffee is a big company that roast there beans by the tons, and I wanted something a bit more personalized). A relatively new boy on the block, like me, Stone Street Coffee is who we&#039;re going with. First off the owners, Stew and Mitch, worked for large well known italian coffee company for many years and die hard coffee connoisseurs . They live coffee. They started with a 12Kilo roaster and have grown up to a larger, but still relatively small operation. They only roast beans to order, so when I get my beans they are completely coated with fresh oils (FYI, a bean that looks dry is a sign of a bean that was roasted many days/weeks/months earlier). <br /><br />My House Blend is a combination of fair trade organic Indonesian, African (Rwandan) and South American beans roasted to a dark mahogany. It&#039;s a really well rounded full bodied cup of coffee. Just writing about it makes me want a cup. I&#039;m also going to offer a &quot;Featured&quot; coffee which will change bi monthly and will generally be a lighter roast. I know any thing I get from Stone Street will be excellent, because of their genuine love of coffee. I&#039;m really glad to know there are other lovers in the neighborhood because I&#039;m very proud of what we&#039;re offering.<br /><br />Thanks again,<br /><br />George

				Yup, we&#039;ll be selling both our house blend and featured coffee in 8oz and 1 lb. packages. In our effort to keep things as fresh as possible, I&#039;ll be ordering it in small quantities at first until I can better estimate what sort of demand we&#039;ll have. <br />The cast of the movie, &quot;Astoria Park&quot; , had a reading of their script today at Hell Gate Social. I had the chance to serve our coffee to them to great reviews. By the way, I sat in on the reading, and am really looking forward to seeing the completed film. It really touched on some of the challenges and beauty that can come out of inter racial communities.

				My bad, I should have specified, darker roasted beans. It is my understanding that a dark roasted bean should have a oily exterior and if it appears to be dry, it is often the result of sitting and being around exposed to air for to long. I am pretty certain that none of the larger companies, however good, roast for their clients to order. I&#039;m not out to knock the competition, but am sincerely excited about I Stone Street coffees. I&#039;m personally not a fan of Dallas, having used them in some of the larger corporate jobs I&#039;ve had in the past, and I do enjoy Stumptown coffee very much. Hoping to pour you a cup soon.<br /><br />George

				I couldn&#039;t agree more about the use or lack of butter in most bakeries. It&#039;s easy to understand why most substitute oils and shortenings for butter, it will stay fresher tasting longer. But the taste, yuck!<br />We&#039;ll be serving both American and French influenced pastries made with BUTTER AND HEAVEY CREAM! We won&#039;t keep our display cases packed to the gills with product because we want to offer as fresh of a product as possible. I&#039;ll try to keep NYCMacUser in astoria with my red velvet cake, or maybe I could win you over with our eclairs which are filled with fresh Tahitian vanilla bean flavored pastry cream made with milk, eggs, sugar, flour and the beans, not the oil based artificial whipped cream that most of us had at our local bakeries growing up. <br />We&#039;ll have cupcakes for the neighborhood kids a more&nbsp; indulgent Valrhona chocolate mousse-praline torte for those who wants something a little more decadent. In the morning we&#039;ll offer croissants, pain au chocolate, blueberry, carrot and bran muffins, scones and a really yummy herb biscuit made with creme fraiche and fine herbs. It goes great with eggs. We&#039;ll have apple wood smoked bacon and thick country pork sausage on the AM menu (6:30am-10am weekdays 9am-3pm weekends).<br />We&#039;re not just a bakery, we&#039;re going to serve a modest but tasty menu including burgers (made with 50%brisket meat), slow roasted chicken sandwiches flavored with Mediterranean spices, lentil burgers, a garden salad, and fresh iced tea and our gingerade (a honey sweetened lemon-ginger-anise iced brew). Our burgers will be on soft egg rolls and our other sandwiches on Portuguese or wheat rolls baked in house. <br />Hope to see you soon,<br /><br />George

				Thanks TRX.

				Well the pressure is definitely on, but I hope to meet your expectations. &nbsp;As far as keeping your fighting weight, I&#039;ve managed throughout the years to keep a healthy weight despite my love of ice cream, chocolate and meat (excluding my 6 yrs of vegetarianism). My rule is to eat healthful food, keep plenty of fruit, nuts and grains in my diet, and indulge in moderation. Even when indulging, I keep it natural. The less processed the better. I think our bodies naturally feel unsatisfied when we eat artificial, processed foods, but if that&#039;s all we&#039;re used to we won&#039;t look for something better. &nbsp;Instead we&#039;ll overeat the junk trying to get satisfaction. I could be totally wrong, but that&#039;s my belief, and it seems to have kept me healthy and happy over the years.

				TRX, that You Tube clip was hysterical. I promise,&nbsp; no vinyl. <br /><br />Thank you for the complement Mer. As far as our muffins, our blueberry streusel, though made with cream cheese, is light and cake-y. Our Carrot and bran muffins are a little bread-eir with a denser crumb. My favorite is the blueberry, because we really use a nice amount of fresh berries in them and the contrast of the cake and streusel work really well. I&#039;m always open to suggestions. What is your ideal muffin?<br /><br />Megc, I am actually contacting the Department of Transportation. They have a program called City Racks, to install bike racks on city sidewalks. I don&#039;t know their turn around time, but I am contacting them to get a rack in front of the store. I was planning to bike to work too, but decided I&#039;d wait until things are up and running. <br /><br />Varda, I would think a bike ride from Ditmars to ABS could be added to your cross training, though if you were tempted by one to many slices of cake, you might have to do a few laps around Astoria Park to complete your work out. <br />

				Oh, I forgot to answer the ideal muffin question.<br /><br />I love somewhat dense but moist bread-y blueberry muffins.&nbsp; And I love when they have crusty, sugary tops.&nbsp; And the bigger and juicier the blueberries, the better.&nbsp; Most recently, I&#039;ve had this kind of muffin at Le Financier.&nbsp; I know, they&#039;re a chain, but unlike everywhere else surrounding my office, they&#039;re the other place that has my kind of muffins. <br /><br />Also, I think it&#039;s a good sign the shop is opening the 18th.&nbsp; That also happens to be the last day of job before I&#039;m off to start an all new awesome one.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)&nbsp; I can celebrate later that day with baked goods.

				in regards to the ideal muffin...I would love a great Banana muffin with no nuts. &nbsp;I love all things bananas but i have a nut allergy. &nbsp;Bananas are often paired with nuts which rules out so many desserts for me, it stinks. &nbsp;<br /><br />Le Pain Quotidien makes a great banana muffin with a sliced/carmelized banana on top. &nbsp;it would be great to get a better version locally though. &nbsp;Now that I think about it, your bakery sounds similar to LPQ based on the menu. &nbsp;I mean that as a positive comment as I think that is one of the best chains around.<br /><br />as TRX mentioned...a good corn muffin would be nice too. &nbsp;It is surprising how hard it is to find a good corn muffin. &nbsp; &nbsp;

				I love love love cranberry muffins. And I will try them anywhere. However, people always seem to overdo the tops with sugar (i assume to counter the tartness of the berries?) which kills it for me. I also could do without always paring cranberry with orange....which can also be overpowering. <br /><br />I will also agree with the corn muffin lover.&nbsp; Born in Indiana, I find myself missing my gramma&#039;s crusty cast iron skillet corn bread....mmmmmm.

				I actually like fruit muffins with lots and lots of fruit - basically fruit being held together by batter rather than batter with some fruit in it, though I&#039;d understand if that could not be a viable muffin commercially. I do love cranberry and orange together - I think it is a perfect pairing.&nbsp; I could go for a banana muffin w/out nuts, though w/nuts is ok, too.&nbsp; Pumpkin muffins are a fave!

				So, a few of us walked over there (post-4 mile run!) and really enjoyed ourselves!&nbsp; We tried a bunch of things - iced coffee, iced tea, and a croissant, slice of maize almond cake, and a carrot orange muffin.&nbsp; Everything was delicious.&nbsp; First, the iced coffee was nice and strong and certainly not dumbed down (iced coffee can be so weak, in my experience) - it&#039;s one of the best iced coffees I&#039;ve had.&nbsp; I loved its rich, smooth flavor.&nbsp; The iced tea - I can&#039;t really speak about it too much as I only had a sip, but I do remember it tasting sweet, which surprised me.<br /><br />Of the three baked items we got, I absolutely loved the maize almond cake.&nbsp; It&#039;s moist, but still a bit crumbly as corn cakes can be, with a lovely citrus flavor to it.&nbsp; Not too sweet either. It was wonderful!<br /><br />The carrot-orange muffin was also great.&nbsp; It was light and moist and I loved the combo of orange and carrot.&nbsp; Again, it was not overly sweet. It had a crunchy top which was due in part to the large crystal sugar sprinkled on it. It does have raisins, in case that matters to you.<br /><br />The croissant was buttery and not like those overly bready croissants you get most places. It was beautifully layered inside and pleasantly browned outside.&nbsp; Basically, it&#039;s how I imagine a croissant should be.&nbsp; I noticed they had pain au chocolat as well, and I&#039;ll give that a try at a later date. <br /><br />Oh!&nbsp; We also had the egg and cheese on a Portuguese roll, which was outstanding!&nbsp; I&#039;ve never had the egg on a roll on anything but a kaiser roll before, but I very much liked Astor Bakery&#039;s version.&nbsp; It was a large roll and thus a substantial sandwich. The egg and cheese were cooked together and it was fabulously savory.&nbsp; Next time I&#039;d add bacon.&nbsp; My friend asked for butter on the roll, and we did like that addition. <br /><br />Overall, I loved the fact that the sweetness of these products is balanced and not overbearing, and that things are moist and not dried out.&nbsp; I don&#039;t eat a lot of sweets these days, so this was exactly the kind of thing I look for when I do indulge - high quality, delicious, well-balanced sweets.<br /><br />I was very happy with things!&nbsp; I&#039;d love to hear what other people thought.&nbsp; I&#039;ll certainly be back.&nbsp; Looking forward to trying their savory things, too.

				&nbsp; &nbsp;My husband and I made the trek to Astor Baker Shop this morning to try them out. They&#039;re still getting up and running, but the experience was very good. We each got a cherry bran muffin and an iced latte. The muffins were tasty and we enjoyed the whole grain toothiness of the bran. The iced lattes were very good-- of a caliber that isn&#039;t typical in this neighborhood. We had a lovely chat with George, and he stopped by all of the tables to make sure that everything was ok-- clearly and excellent and invested business owner. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;We also got red velvet cake to try this evening. While it was tasty, it wasn&#039;t what I expect from red velvet. I expect a moist cake that is light with a delicate crumb, a distinct buttermilk flavor, and a slight hint of cocoa. This cake was moist and very dense (due to a lot of butter-- stains on the box told us that much) and didn&#039;t seem to include any cocoa, as I had suspected from the color. The cream cheese frosting was excellent, but this won&#039;t become a usual selection for me despite my slight obsession with red velvet.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Overall, this will be an excellent addition to the neighborhood, and we plan on returning soon to try the other selections!

				Was able to visit today for lunch and various sweets!<br /><br />Between my friend and I, we had the Astor burger, the bacon/cheddar/onion burger, herb fries, salted lemonade, maize almond cake, chocolate ganache cupcake, and the brown butter blueberry tart. Oh! And an iced coffee.&nbsp; :wink:<br /><br />The burgers were moist and very flavorful. I really enjoyed the creamy Astor sauce (hint of chipotle) with the rest of the toppings - pickles, sliced grape tomatoes,slaw,onion. The bacon cheddar burger was very good as well. We were amazed at how the different toppings completely changed the entire flavoring of the burger. The herb fries were crisp and served with garlic and chives. And the salted lemonade was perfect for today&#039;s 93 degrees. <br /><br />After reading earlier posts about the maize cake, I was so excited to see it sitting on the top of the case when we arrived.&nbsp; It was soooo good. Perfect amount of sweetness, lemon and butter yumminess, and I love the texture from the polenta flour. I am not a huge chocolate person but I thought that the chocolate cupcake was very good. The cake part didn&#039;t have an overpowering chocolate taste which really balanced well with the rich toppings. It was moist and enormous for what I am used to in a cupcake. Definitely bring friends to share!<br />My favorite treat today though had to be the brown butter blueberry tart. It was just awesome. So fresh. And I am such a picky person when it comes to crust and this was so great...you can really tell that they are committed to good ingredients. <br /><br />The staff was very nice and we chatted with George for quite awhile. He took the time to tell us all about the baked goods and his future plans for specialty coffee roasts. All in all a great visit. I will be back! My friend Brad that accompanied me is a food writer and will be writing a piece in the near future. I will link it when available.

				Okay do I praise this place, or curse it, for being a major bakery breakthrough for Astoria.&nbsp; After thoroughly enjoying a delicious lentil burger with horseradish sauce, creamy cole slaw, and an exceptional (and humongous) piece of carrot cake there today, I have to say that it is beyond any comparable bakery nearby (Martha&#039;s?&nbsp; not even close).&nbsp; Everything in the bakery cases looked excellent - not pretty presentation, like Martha&#039;s, but quality ingredients and preparation.<br /><br />I love Astoria, but many places don&#039;t show as much care about the ingredients, creative combinations, and preparation of what they serve.&nbsp; It seems most comparable to Cannelle in Jackson Heights in feeling very comfortable for the neighborhood, but entirely committed to quality beyond that of a neighborhood food mill.<br /><br />Congratulations to those who&#039;ve created it and run it.&nbsp; Long may it prosper.<br /><br />And why might I curse it?&nbsp; Because I got tempted to indulge in eating a whole piece of carrot cake by myself today.&nbsp; I can&#039;t avoid going back soon either.

				Took a long walk this morning and had a sweet filled breakfast.&nbsp; Well, we showed up too late for breakfast - which ends at noon :(&nbsp; So we ordered blueberry muffin, red velvet cake, and split a burger.&nbsp; All were pretty amazing, and we were treated to a brownie on the house because the burger took a bit.&nbsp; Definitely a nice addition to the neighborhood, I just wish it were closer to me!&nbsp; Although that would be dangerous, lol.&nbsp; I&#039;d easily gain 50 pounds, the food tastes so good.<br /><br />One recommendation for when they ramp up and get more of their menu items going - have breakfast last longer on the weekends&nbsp; - ie do a brunch.<br /><br />BF was super interested in trying the biscuits but they&#039;re not serving them yet.&nbsp; Will have to go back when things are more settled :)

				Went here this afternoon and took out some lunch.&nbsp; They only had lentil and other burgers available so we got a lentil and an Astor.&nbsp; &nbsp;We also got a chocolate cupcake and a blueberry tart.&nbsp; Everything was phenomenal.&nbsp; Love how the desserts had a very adult/less sweet taste.&nbsp; It always makes me extra excited to find something so delicious and vegetarian like the lentil burger.&nbsp; Definitely going to come back here and try some more things.&nbsp; Hopefully they will have those chicken sandwiches available next time.

				I went to the bakery on Saturday morning to pick up some pastries for guests that i had coming over.&nbsp; I grabbed a bunch of stuff to sample and each and every item was very very good...most bordering on great.&nbsp; <br /><br />The croissant was flaky and nice...moist in the middle.&nbsp; There was some mini cake type thing that had blackberries, raspberries, rum and something else.&nbsp; It was very good and it had whole blackberries in the middle of it.&nbsp; I really enjoyed getting a full piece of fruit in there.&nbsp; However, the best thing that I had was definitely the blueberry muffin.&nbsp; I am not even a big blueberry muffin fan but this thing was fantastic.&nbsp; It was so moist and nice.&nbsp; I want one right now.&nbsp; <br /><br />I got an iced coffee to go and it was very good as well.&nbsp; It is clear that the ingredients are all of very good quality and there is indeed butter in them muffins!<br /><br />I haven&#039;t even tried the cooked food but this place is already a fantastic addition to the neighborhood in my book.&nbsp; I look forward to trying other items.&nbsp;

				Thanks for trying our product. We do use cocoa powder in our Red Velvet, but perhaps the ratios are different from other red velvet cakes you&#039;ve had before. If your looking for a chocolatey kick, try our double chocolate cake or brownies, both made with a 61% bitter sweet chocolate.<br /><br />George

				Thank you for all the positive feed back. We&#039;re extending our hours this weekend.&nbsp; If your looking to give us a try, our kitchen and cafe will be opened until 9pm this friday, until 10 pm on saturday and again until 9pm on sunday. <br />We&#039;re adding a few extra goodies too. A lavender honey panna cotta with a strawberry gelee and fresh tahitian vanilla bean whipped cream. An extra tangy lemon pound cake, a tasty, satisfying tres leche cake with a house made pineapple confit and toasted meringue and buttery 4th of July cookies. Buttery raisin studded scones and coconut macaroons are new additions too. <br /><br />We&#039;re also adding a delicious chicken sandwich seasoned with Raz el Hanout and served on our Portuguese roll&nbsp; and a garden salad with a choice of house made dressings including freshly made Caesar, shallot or citrus dressing.<br />Hope to see you over this holiday weekend.<br /><br />George

				Went back again, this time picked up an orange carrot muffin and a blueberry apricot tea cake.&nbsp; Wow, they were both extraordinary quality.&nbsp; I&#039;m amazed and thrilled to have a bakery of this caliber in the neighborhood.&nbsp; <br /><br />Must go to the gym now.

				George,<br /><br />I stopped by the place a week ago with my little sister. We had the red velvet cake, iced tea, herb fries, a cheeseburger, and the Astor burger. Everything was delicious and very fresh tasting. I&#039;m so glad to see a charming little place like this in Astoria. However, as tasty as the Astor burger was, the bread got soggy very, very quickly. The bread bun just could not hold up the coleslaw and that yummy sauce of yours. That&#039;s my only complaint. Otherwise, like I said, everything was delicious and I will be back soon.&nbsp;

				Finally tried it and went two days in a row this weekend.&nbsp; It&#039;s a terrific place.&nbsp; They appear to be doing very well.&nbsp; Not just because there is nothing else like it within many blocks of Astor Bakery.&nbsp; But it stands on its own merit.&nbsp; It&#039;s a very comfortable place to sit and relax.&nbsp; They really did a nice job with the space.&nbsp; &nbsp;I had a bran/cherry muffin.&nbsp; Had just enough bite of bran fiber but was still moist and delicious.&nbsp; The cherries were just right.&nbsp; Not too sweet or sour.&nbsp; I also tried the maize almond cake.&nbsp; I really liked this.&nbsp; It offers a rich desert option to those trying to avoid something loaded with white flour.&nbsp; Sounds odd but I thought a touch of saltiness would have made it richer.&nbsp; Went back the next day for lunch.&nbsp; I had a beef burger and a lentil burger.&nbsp; Both on whole wheat Portuguese rolls.&nbsp; You definitely have to get the burger on this roll.&nbsp; The crust was just right to hold up to the juicy burger, but not so crusty that it would chip a tooth or break up into crumbs.&nbsp; And it was delicious as far as the bread itself.&nbsp; I saw they were using these rolls for the egg sandwiches as well.&nbsp; The lentil burger was delicious and satisfying.&nbsp; But turns out more like a spread than a burger as it&#039;s more like a paste in texture.&nbsp; But I&#039;m not complaining.&nbsp; It would be ruined if they added things that made it hold up more like a burger.&nbsp; The beef burger was very good as well.&nbsp; Cooked just right (they didn&#039;t ask) and seemed to be salted, which I liked.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to see something nicer than ketchup packets on the side&nbsp; (like a simple bottle of Heinz).&nbsp; But I loved the horseradish sauce that was on the roll with the lentil burger.&nbsp; The toppings of pickled onions were a nice touch.&nbsp; The garden salad with homemade shallot dressing was very refreshing.&nbsp; Iced coffee is delicious and not a wimpy coffee.&nbsp; I bought a few bags of the beans as well.&nbsp; The gingerade is really delicious.&nbsp; Not too sweat and a noticeable ginger bite.&nbsp; &nbsp;And we brought home some July 4 cookies.&nbsp; The cookie was like a black and white.&nbsp; Really good.&nbsp; Authentic in every way.&nbsp; This place is a home run.&nbsp; Very glad it&#039;s there.

				I went Friday and picked up an assortment for my Annual July 4th Cutthroat Scrabble Game!<br /><br />I personally don&#039;t feel qualified to critique food, but I do know what got the ahhs and ohhs.<br /><br />Almond Croissant: was light and delicate but came without the surprise I had hoped for: a dollop of almond paste in the center<br /><br />Bread Pudding Loaf: heavy, rich and not too sweet . . . left us all moaning for more<br /><br />Mini Chocolate Loaf: served all 4 of us with a few bites of yumminess<br /><br />Maize Almond Cake: the perfect accompaniment for midnight iced coffee<br /><br />Eclair: got 4 ehs<br /><br />61% Dark Chocolate Ganache Cupcake: everyone agreed . . . George stole my recipe (should be eaten at room temperature for the best flavor.)<br /><br />Red Velvet Cake: the frosting is outstanding; the cake lacked the hidden punch of the cocoa (jack up the cocoa and it will be perfection)<br /><br />Butter Blueberry Tart: this got 4 ahhs and 4 ohhs and moaning and picking the crumbs off the plate and 30 minutes of licking fingers<br /><br />All-in-all a wonderful ending to our annual event was had by all. I will be back to try a few more things that caught my eye . . . I may even find the time to go and sit down and enjoy something more hearty.<br /><br />Welcome to Astoria, Astor. Keep telling us about new things here so we can come over and try them out.

				The mini cupcakes are very cute, and just the right size when you only want a taste of something. &nbsp;I was very pleased with the coconut-lemon version. &nbsp;And the almond meringues are nice too: crunchy on the outside and soft and gooey on the inside (like a melted marshmallow).

				My pal and I have been to Astor Bakery 3 times and over these visits have shared a blueberry tart, carrot cake, red velvet cake and a blueberry muffin.&nbsp; We&#039;ve also had coffee. All have been eaten in (i.e., not &quot;to go&quot;).&nbsp; The blueberry tart and blueberry muffin were excellent, clearly they use fresh blueberries. Yum.&nbsp; The carrot cake was unlike any other I&#039;ve had, and not in a good way.&nbsp; There was nothing carroty about it. In fact, my pal keeps saying it reminded him of Christmas cake (he means those awful fruit cakes).&nbsp; The red velvet cake to me was meh, to my pal excellent.&nbsp; I hated the icing (too thick, too sweet), he loved it (cause it was thick and sweet).&nbsp; Eating in there is very pleasant, and it is a welcome addition to Astoria.&nbsp; I look forward to sharing a brownie and maybe the lentil burger.&nbsp;

				So I finally got a chance to try it this weekend. It was good but it wasn&#039;t amazing. Blueberry muffin was great, the blueberry tart was good, the almond maize cake was just ok. It tasted like sweetened cornbread you could make from the box with a little almond extract. It&#039;s no Baby Jesus cake. The lentil burger fell apart entirely and had to eat it with a fork. The roll on the chicken sandwich fell apart too and there were diced carrots on the sandwich instead of tomatoes which was weird but the chicken itself was really good. Our iced tea came in plastic cups and were given ketchup packets with our fries (which weren&#039;t crispy). There are some kinks to iron out there. I think they had 5 people in the kitchen and 3 tables of people when I was there with 3 people on the floor. I have to say the price was on the money, all that food for $35 isn&#039;t bad. I think I&#039;d go back for dessert but maybe not for food until they figure things out a bit more.

				Hi there fellow Astorians,<br /><br />I just wanted to recommend everyone check out Astor Bake Shop.&nbsp; I went there tonight for the first time since I&#039;d seen a lot of rave reviews and it was terrific!&nbsp; They&#039;re brand new -- only a month old -- so go and show some support for this new business.&nbsp; The chef-owner who runs the place is a real stand-up guy and this is his labor of love.&nbsp; The food is great.&nbsp; The burger is fantastic as are the desserts (he was a pastry chef for 22 years).&nbsp; The cheesecake is absolutely delicious.&nbsp; Their web site is at http://www.astor-bakeshop.com/ and you can find them on Facebook and Twitter (@AstorBakeShop).

				Just stopped by the Bake Shop for the first time tonight after reading the overall rave reviews on this board. I had the almond maize cake, and my friend had the NY cheesecake. Both were deliciously yummy! The almond cake was a perfect fit for the nicely brewed cappuccino that I had, and the cheesecake was fairly fluffy for a NY cheesecake (which I usually find too dense and heavy). Both the people working the counter in the shop (one of which was the owner) were super nice and friendly, even though my friend and I overextended our welcome when we stayed past closing time. Will definitely return, even if it&#039;s a bit of a walk!

As he was loosening a slice from the tray I said- half jokingly, &quot;Give me a slice with lots of peaches&quot; and without even blinking he accomodated me and gave me a different slice than the one he originally intended to serve me. This was probably the fifth time we were there, and I have to say the counter people have always been polite towards us. We always order &quot;to go&quot;, walk to the park and pig out on the bench while watching joggers huff and puff around the track. This place is hard to resist.

The pitfall of internet conversations.<br /><br />I expected someone to respond to my post with that; &#039;Why didn&#039;t you just speak up?&quot; I&#039;m a quiet guy and I&#039;ve worked in retail and really thought they were busy. I know I used to hate it when a customer would begin asking questions when I was trying to wrap something up with another customer. So I waited. And sure, the moment they decided to look me in the eye, I could have said something, but it shouldn&#039;t be my responsibility to try and decide when the right time is to jump in and ask questions. This is a business isn&#039;t it? Doesn&#039;t the fact that I walked in, looked things over and made a decision on what I wanted and waited in front of an employee for several minutes mean I&#039;m their to give them money for their goods? Shouldn&#039;t they be eager to make money? And just in general, if you have someone waiting to ask you something and they stand in front of you, shouldn&#039;t you give them some kind of acknowledgment? Shouldn&#039;t I have at least gotten a &quot;Be with you in a minute&quot;? Especially as a line is beginning to form?<br /><br />The argument that I should have to speak up in a business environment, as a customer who is looking to do nothing but make an order isn&#039;t valid I think.<br /><br />I mean I disagree with that just like I&#039;d disagree with someone saying a passenger on the subway should have to ask someone who has their legs spread wide, making it difficult to sit in a seat, to make space. Or to have them remove a bag that&#039;s occupying a seat. I think there&#039;s an argument of extrovert and introvert in there. But doesn&#039;t it come down to just being courteous and aware of the people around you?<br /><br />As for why I walked out annoyed; I&#039;m not going to stir up problems with an employee. If I&#039;m not going to be offered help in a business, I won&#039;t give them my money then. How am I supposed to know how they&#039;d react if I tried to interrupt them. Sure I could have gotten what I wanted, a &quot;be right with you&quot; but I may also have gotten ignored or shot a mean response. Again, I&#039;m someone willing to give them money for service.

Underpaid or not, aren&#039;t the front line employees responsible for putting the business&#039; best foot forward? I know there must have been times when I didn&#039;t come off entirely cheerful or as helpful as a customer would have liked when I did retail but I know that I&#039;ve never knowingly had a customer waiting to be helped and not have them know I&#039;d get to them.<br /><br />The food and drink and everything else could be fantastic in this place, and it sure smelled like it was, but in that particular moment I wasn&#039;t offered the opportunity to try it.

				I think I&#039;d be more likely to be with you on this if we were talking about Applebee&#039;s or McDonalds&#039;s, or even Five Napkin Burger.&nbsp; These large well-capitalized corporate ventures have the resources for large teams of consultants and managers to plan their operations and staff training on a completely different scale than the incredibly brave, risk-taking entrepreneur(s) behind a labor-of-love like the Astor Bake Shop.&nbsp; Not only is there a glaring difference in the capitalization and the resources, but crikey - the profit margin simply can&#039;t be to great.&nbsp; At least not in anything approaching the near-term.&nbsp; <br /><br />Best of luck to them.&nbsp; I would be that until they start seeing profits, they&#039;ll be lifted up by community support, encouragement, and positive, constructive feedback.&nbsp; Not an easy project to launch, I wouldn&#039;t think.&nbsp; It&#039;ll be fun to watch this &quot;baby&quot; grow!

				passed by astor a few days ago and it looked good, so i went in.&nbsp; sorry to say, i had a similarly discouraging experience.&nbsp; there were four other people on line with me, and three of us left after being stared at, and then ignored by the waitstaff.&nbsp; &nbsp;the fourth seemed to know someone on staff and started chatting with someone that was wiping down a table.<br /><br />i&#039;m sure the food is good, and i&#039;m not against coming back.&nbsp; but it&#039;s not going to be the first on my list.&nbsp; bottom line: the people who work there are just as representative of astor as the food is.&nbsp; and if you can&#039;t get any food, well, you&#039;re leaving with a not-so-hot first impression.&nbsp; <br /><br />just a note to round2: your encouragement and positive attitude is great, and i also hope that astor does well, as i love baked goods.&nbsp; but can you maybe admit that it doesn&#039;t take a large amount of resources or teams of consultants to get your waitstaff to say, &quot;i&#039;ll be right with you,&quot; and perhaps even crack a smile?&nbsp; i used to work for a small mom-and-pop shop, too, and i can&#039;t say that minimal cash flow made me, or the owners, forget that the customer comes first.&nbsp; i mean, that&#039;s where the money comes from!<br /><br />&nbsp;

				This place is becoming our Sunday evening ritual. My boyfriend and I took a walk to Astor Bake Shop again yesterday. We ordered two different versions of their chocolate mousse to go. I had the one with raspberries. The raspberries were plump, fresh and juicy, the mousse was light, not too sweet and so, so chocolatey. No problems with the service. As a matter of fact, someone cut in front of us in line, but the counterperson helped us first. That&#039;s very cool in my book. Knowing my boyfriend, though, he would&#039;ve spoken up if she hadn&#039;t. <br />Only gripe I have is that they don&#039;t provide the option of ordering regular old sodas to accompany the burgers. Nothing like a Coke and a cheeseburger! I had the gingerade and the ginger flavor was a little too subtle for my taste. And the sea salt lemonade was &quot;interesting&quot;, but still nice.

				We visited this morning for a coffee and croissant.&nbsp; The table service is a cocktail of annoying and awkward - I just hate it. What purpose could it possibly serve during the breakfast hour on Tuesday morning?&nbsp; Our almond croissant was soggy, although the ingredients tasted like they were of high quality.&nbsp; I&#039;m willing to chalk the subpar croissant up to bad luck, but I have to wonder how long it had been sitting.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />The coffee was fine - probably the best coffee out I know of within easy walk of ditmars, but no better than that.&nbsp; It&#039;s possible the espresso drinks are the thing to get, I suppose.<br /><br />In short, my preliminary verdict is a lot less positive than most other people I&#039;ve read so far, but I&#039;ll give several more tries before writing the place off.&nbsp; The bake shop&#039;s heart is in the right place.<br /><br />But if the owner is reading, please get rid of the darned table service for before, say, 4 pm, at least during the week. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				<br /><br />http://www.astor-bakeshop.com/<br /><br /><br />I like to think the owner and workers welcome constructive critiques. You might even contact them.<br />My preference here is to highlight what I like and then also let the establishment know what I dont like as much.<br /><br />We enjoy their coffee beans and would continue to order them. I like their coffee better iced. If you dont like it, I am curious where you might find better in Astoria. (We do like getting out to LIC as well.)<br />Sad to hear about a disappointing croissant. It should be a standout for a place like this.<br /><br /><br />For me, the place is a nice option when I am close to the park area.<br />

				My husband and I were looking for somewhere to go for a quick bite last week so we popped in.&nbsp; &nbsp;I ordered the Astor burger, my husband got the bacon cheddar burger.&nbsp; We both ordered a Gingerade.&nbsp; My burger was awesome.&nbsp; The bun was so fresh, obviously made there, my burger was juicy and delicious. I loved the Astor sauce.&nbsp; My husband said his burger was just good but raved about the bacon.&nbsp; Gingerades were good too, hubbys was more gingery than mine though.&nbsp; I ordered a chocolate panna cotta for the road....and WOW, it was really amazing, so chocolately.&nbsp; Hubby had some chocolate chocolate chip cookies.&nbsp; Those were yummy too but he likes a soft cookie and theirs are crunchy so he wasn&#039;t thrilled.&nbsp; The service was good, our waiter was very friendly and attentive but I can understand some of the comments being made.&nbsp; It’s definitely a little awkward when you walk in as to what you&#039;re supposed to do or who to talk to if you want to order.&nbsp; We&#039;ll definitely go back though.&nbsp;

				We actually had an unpleasant experience over the weekend.&nbsp; Called in an order for both Astor burgers and lentil burgers so they&#039;d be ready by the time we got there to pick them up.&nbsp; When finally got to eat the burgers, we noticed they had none of the toppings or sauces.&nbsp; Only a lettuce leaf on each.&nbsp; The Astor sauce, horseradish sauce, pickled onions - these things really make their burgers special.&nbsp; So it was a huge disappointment that it was all missing.&nbsp; And a little upsetting that called in orders would be treated differently than when we eat in the bakery.&nbsp; We still love the place and this won&#039;t change our mind about going there.&nbsp; But maybe they do have a few staffing issues to work on.

				I&#039;m not here to pile on, but I also had an unpleasant experience at Astor Bake Shop last weekend.&nbsp; While I was seated right away for lunch, no one returned to take my order for over ten minutes.&nbsp; I found the staff to be aloof, glancing in my direction without ever wandering over. There were only three other customers in the whole place.&nbsp; &nbsp;When I finally ordered, it was for the Warm Chicken Sandwich with a side of cole slaw and the aforementioned Sea Salt Lemonade. The Lemonade arrived first, and was bland, not citrus-y at all, and salty.&nbsp; Well okay, I knew when ordering that it was flavored with salt, but the condiment added nothing to the drink whatsoever, and reminded me of a lemony dental rinse.&nbsp; Then the sandwich arrived.&nbsp; Having ordered off the blackboard, I looked forward to all the sandwich ingredients I saw listed there, including tomatoes.&nbsp; Mine arrived without tomatoes, so when I was able to flag my server down (not once did any staffer come to the table on their own) I asked about the tomatoes and was bluntly informed that the sandwich did not come with tomatoes.&nbsp; I pointed to the blackboard, where it was clearly listed, and my server deadpanned, &quot;Well the board is wrong.&quot;&nbsp; Not only that, I wasn&#039;t even offered an apology, or a couple of tomato slices.&nbsp; I found this to be rather rude, and I assure you that my manner was calm and polite.&nbsp; I finished the tomato-less sammy, which was pretty good otherwise, and moved on to the salad.&nbsp; One bite told me it had been wrongly seasoned, was WAY too citrus-y (the citrus missing from my lemonade, perhaps?) with no balance of oil or sweetness.&nbsp; It was barely edible, and I ate it only due to the small portion of the lunch.&nbsp; At the end of the meal, I again had to flag down my server to get a check.&nbsp; I left disappointed, although I always leave a good tip for some reason.&nbsp; I could even have put up with the so-so food had the service been a little more on-point.&nbsp; They acted as though they were doing me a favor each and every time.&nbsp; I think they have more to work on than just staffing issues.&nbsp; I found the whole experience to be regrettable and I won&#039;t be going back anytime soon.&nbsp; Astoria is filled with delicious alternatives run by people who are actually glad you gave them a try.&nbsp; For $15, this lunch was a bust.

				It was written before that ABS has it&#039;s heart in the right place with regards to what they want to offer the neighborhood and I couldn&#039;t agree more after receiving correspondence from the owner, who offered to make up for my poor experience and explained efforts have been made to train it&#039;s staff on better service. If they&#039;ve done this with other customers who reported less than stellar service then I know that ABS is a business that&#039;s keeping on their toes and want to better serve it&#039;s customers.<br /><br />I know it&#039;s not always easy to make sure an employee will live up to what they presented themselves as during the hiring process, or retain and apply the training given to them, so I&#039;m hoping staffing changes and more training will make walk-in and sit down customers equally happy.<br /><br />My first review was pretty harsh, but I&#039;m now open to trying again after the positive experience that came from seeing that the owner cares enough to respond to individual customers.<br /><br />(On a completely different note, and I&#039;m sure it&#039;s been discussed before, but the negative and positive nod system, it can be a pretty infuriating thing. Sure it&#039;s a different form of expressing an opinion but the anonymity behind it paired with never knowing what explanation someone has for judging your post is a little off putting. I&#039;m sure there are positives to having it but it feels like it could just empower trolls more. And I&#039;ll probably get a neg nod just for writing this. :T)

				The service was a little slow but I think because they were a bit understaffed. One waiter/cashier for the entire place. The restaurant was totally full so this guy had his hands full. Still was very polite though. I think ABS will have some growing pains until they get up to speed but their product is good so they get an A for effort in my book. :wink:

				I&#039;ve been to ABS a couple of times - LOVE it.&nbsp; Haven&#039;t been in a while as I&#039;m trying to cut back on my eating ... but we saw ... George?? (I think is the owners name) at Taste of QUeens last night - and ate some of his goodies.... <br /><br />In the meantime I just read an older review above and am baffled by the customer who was upset by having to wait so long for someone to &quot;come over&quot; to take an order and then to come over and check on things and to get a check.&nbsp; <br /><br />There&#039;s no table service in this place.&nbsp; Only 3 customers and you had to wait??? They were waiting for you to get up and figure it out (perhaps NOT the best tack to take as a service professional - but they didn&#039;t want you to look silly??)<br /><br />The place has great food.&nbsp; Very accommodating staff (been there with a flock of strollers/toddlers).&nbsp; Great atmosphere.&nbsp; <br /><br />only wish it was 10 blocks closer. <br /><br />

				I&#039;ve been twice now and both times I was greeted immediately upon entering, asked to choose a table and was provided with great, friendly, efficient table service. I never once had to go up to the counter. Had egg sandwiches both times and they were awesome, particularly the rolls, which tasted incredibly fresh. The first time, though, they decided to be quite liberal with the pepper on the egg, and I hate pepper. But it was nothing a little ketchup couldn&#039;t mask. Tried their iced coffee as well, which was on point.

Sure, some people have had bad experiences - but, while I didn&#039;t go back and count the responses in this thread, but I&#039;m pretty sure more people have liked it than not. Unfortunately, although it sucks to put all your time, money, and effort into starting a business/making art/any other sort of voluntary personal endeavor only to get it crapped on by a percentage of the populace, this is the way things work. If people spend their money at a place and find that the service and/or food aren&#039;t worth the money they spent, they will feel negatively about it. If other people disagree, they&#039;ll say so. But people are never going to feel good about being told to keep their negative opinions to themselves, especially when they feel like they were treated badly by employees at a business, or like there was something seriously wrong with the food. <br /><br />But again, most of the reviews for Astor Bake Shop have been positive. I&#039;m sure the place has seen a lot more business than it would have if this thread weren&#039;t here, negative reviews and all.

So no, it&#039;s really not that ridiculous, nor is it &quot;obvious&quot; that you are supposed to order at the counter and then wait to have it brought to you. It&#039;s a brand new business, so of course we do not know how it chooses to operate. I worked in restaurants for nearly a decade and I would never just assume that a new customer should just automatically &quot;know&quot; they have to order at the counter. Any good employee would offer guidance.

				What are people&#039;s views of Astor Bake Shop these days? I finally made it out there to try it today for the first time, and I must say my husband and I were both disappointed. The gingerade was way too sweet (though that could just be personal preference), and I found the blueberry butter tart to be very blah. As soon as I saw it (I ordered it before it had been put in the display case), I knew it was not going to be what I expected. It looked dry and dense. While it did not actually taste dry, it did simply taste like a dense mound of brown sugar and bland crust. The blueberries had surprisingly little flavor. My husband also got a slice of the cheesecake, and while he liked it, it was on the sour side. So what is the verdict? Has Astor Bake Shop gone downhill or was this just an off day? Based on this experience, I wouldn&#039;t plan on making the long trek back anytime soon.

				I have had very positive experiences here lately; we bought a red velvet cake for my mother-in law&#039;s birthday, and it was fantastic. We&#039;ve been several times for breakfast, and while the menu is somewhat limited and prices are not cheap, the food is always fantastic. Their eggs benedict is out of this world...instead of an english muffin, it was served on some kind of herbed biscuit that was incredibly moist and flavorful..I also thought their blueberry and banana pancakes were phenomenal. Now, the service can be slow and not incredibly attentive, but it&#039;s also the kind of place you can linger at a bit..it&#039;s leisurely and relaxing. Still my go to place when I need to bring dessert to a party, and I&#039;m happy ABS is around.

				I think that they are still turning out some of the best baked goods in town.&nbsp; Last weekend i had a strawberry-rhubarb brown butter tart that was fantastic.&nbsp; Their coffee is some of the best in town and the burgers are quite good too.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think that the thing with the service is somewhat intentional.&nbsp; they want people to linger and relax and I that is kind of induced by the lack of over the top service<br />

				I am a weekend brunch regular at Astor Bake Shop. Yes, the service can be slow but the three regular staff members (one is the owner) are very sweet and accommodating people.&nbsp; &nbsp;Recently, the service has gotten a lot quicker. They&#039;ve hired one new person to help at least on the weekends during brunch (I&#039;ve never visited during the week).&nbsp; The pancakes, egg sandwich, and burgers are phenomenal.&nbsp; The cakes and cupcakes which I&#039;ve brought to gatherings are delicious. I&#039;m extremely picky about Red Velvet Cake and Astor Bake Shop&#039;s is moist and flavorful.&nbsp; The one item I don&#039;t enjoy is the baked chicken sandwich-the meat is mostly dark and the flavor is odd.
