				Hi people,<br /><br />I live in the top floor of a house around the Ditmars area. I have a rather small room, less than 70 sq ft I believe. I am thinking about getting a fan or AC as the weather getting warmer. What do you guys think? Do I need to have an AC? I prefer not to have it not because of the cost since I don&#039;t need to pay utilities. I like fresh air, with an AC, the window will be closed all summer. The AC would waste so much electricity and the heat of it is going to contribute to the green house gas. Big no no. It also would be noisy at some degree! If a fan can solve the problem, I definitely would go for it. I just worry that a fan isn&#039;t going to help much when the temperature gets up to 90 and above like last night. I was sweating before I fell asleep! Please tell me your experience/opinion, it&#039;s my first year in Astoria and I never live in anywhere without an AC before! I just want to do the right thing!<br /><br />Thank you!&nbsp; :-P

				I love AC!&nbsp; I went without for most of my life, but I suffered through the long hot summers of NYC and would often find myself at the library or a friend&#039;s cool AC apartment to get some relief.&nbsp; The nights were the worst!&nbsp; <br /><br />I think you could get a fairly cheap, 5,000 BTU Energy Star at PC Richards on 35th Avenue and your negative impact would be very minimal.&nbsp; My electric bill for my large studio is close to $100 for the summer months, but that might go up with the new increase.<br /><br />Good luck!&nbsp;

				I pretty much melt in hot weather, but pretty much try to stick to using a fan in the daytime and use my AC only in the evenings so I can sleep.<br /><br />You might want to look into getting a small AC at least for when you sleep. Two things to consider: One is that what AC does that a fan can&#039;t is pull the humidity out of the room, which can greatly affect your comfort level. Second, you&#039;re on the top floor of your building... hot air rises so your place will feel warmer. I remember living in a 4th floor walk-up and there was a 15 degree temp difference from the first floor to my apt! Ughh.<br /><br />Another thing I like to do is to keep my curtains closed during the day (especially if I&#039;m not home) so the sun doesn&#039;t heat up my place.<br /><br />Whatever you do, hope you keep cool!&nbsp; 8-)<br /><br />

				Where are you from originally? I think this makes a difference. <br /><br />I&#039;m from the South, where weather like this weekend starts in March and summers regularly hit over 100 degrees. So the heat here (while gross, especially in the subway) doesn&#039;t bother me that much. I spent five summers without a/c and there were only three or four nights each year that bothered me. A good fan or two, open windows, and a cool shower right before bed worked just fine. <br /><br />I do admit to going to friend&#039;s apartments during the really hot days to hang out...but that was also because they wouldn&#039;t come to my sauna.

				First, I would recheck the square footage. 70 sqft is real tiny. <br />The heat off the AC is not a green house gas. With such a small space you can get a very light AC<br />http://www.homedepot.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?storeId=10051&amp;langId=-1&amp;catalogId=10053&amp;productId=100588718&amp;N=10000003+90401+503405<br /><br />This one is only 55 lbs so you can take it out when you are not going to use it. Plus it has a built in timer to save electricity.

				Thanks everyone!<br /><br />Purplecurlgirl: I&#039;m originially from hong kong and I don&#039;t know anywhere has the worst humidity and heat compared with there (probably the Amazon). I did indulged in AC back there but since I&#039;ve been to the States (10 years!), I don&#039;t remember I desperated need it as much. <br /><br />The heat off the AC is not a green house gas. I should be more careful with my wording. However, if one household had an AC on, often the heat will drift to the next door and force the neighbors to turn on their AC as well. That&#039;s the experience I have back in Hong Kong. It&#039;s basically a chain reaction and we really don&#039;t need to waste more energy to make electricity as it is. And also the heat makes the surrounding area hotter which I always hated.&nbsp; <br /><br />Unfortunately, my room is really that tiny&nbsp; :-D. The good thing is, I only need a small AC or fan to cool it down. My roommate has an AC but he has his door closed at all time so I guess it won&#039;t be much use if he&#039;s turning it on or not and also if he turns it on, I probably have to close the window due to the loud noise if not the heat from the AC. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=14759.msg172069.html#msg172069">Quote from: amsci on April 27, 2009, 09:36:23 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I pretty much melt in hot weather, but pretty much try to stick to using a fan in the daytime and use my AC only in the evenings so I can sleep.<br /><br />You might want to look into getting a small AC at least for when you sleep.

				I think all window ac&#039;s also have a fan option, so when you don&#039;t need ac you can still just have moving air.&nbsp;

				Well, if you really hate the AC, you probably could get by with a fan. I can&#039;t sleep if I&#039;m hot, as I was last night because my AC hasn&#039;t been put in the window yet. Eventually I splashed water on myself so my fan would be more effective, and for a couple minutes I was actually cold. So if you&#039;re okay with doing stuff like that to keep cool, technically you can get by without the AC if you have an oscillating fan that blows all over you and you don&#039;t care about sleeping with sheets on you. My old room was probably about the same size as yours - 9x7. AC was a must. My new room is a few feet bigger with higher ceilings, so I&#039;m going to experiment with not putting the AC in since I still only have one window and it is nice to have it open. You might as well try the fan thing and see how it goes. Later this week it will be cold again.

				How many windows in the room? You can get a window fan that sucks out- this will pull air IN the other window and make it cooler even if it is pulling in the warm air. Just having the air circulate can be better than a breeze blowing on you all night.

It&#039;s exactly what I did at my last apartment.<br /><br />If you only have 1 window put the window fan unit in the top of the window blowing out and open the window at the bottom -- this way the window fan blows the hot air out and sucks in the much cooler outside air. You could try it the other way around, window fan in the bottom and window open at the top, but I suspect that since hot air rises and all you&#039;ll be more successful with it the opposite way.<br /><br />Hope this helps, I completely understand wanting to avoid a window hogging air conditioner. I&#039;m from FL, so I might be a little warm weather biased, but I&#039;ve successfully avoided them for 5 years and counting now. :-)
