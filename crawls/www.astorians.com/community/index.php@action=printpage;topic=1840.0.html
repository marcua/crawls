				http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2006/03/29/waronchristians/<br /><br />excerpt: <br /><br />&#39;&quot;My friends,&quot; White said in a stentorian voice like burnished oak, &quot;America is no longer good. Unrighteousness, evil, corruption, perversion and death are now standard operating procedure in the United States of America. If we do not put an end to it now, in this moment of divine destiny, then God will and God should judge America.&quot; <br /><br />This was remarkable language to hear at a political forum. Imagine if Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi gave a conference address that was followed by a furious condemnation of her country. She would have to scramble to distance herself from it and would be excoriated in the press regardless. But it&#39;s not unusual to encounter this kind of thing at one of Scarborough&#39;s events because they manage to bring together congressmen -- this one featured Sen. John Cornyn and Republican Reps. Todd Akin and Louis Gohmert -- with some of the most radical elements of what was once the right-wing fringe. (Sen. Sam Brownback was supposed to speak as well, but he couldn&#39;t make it because he was needed for a vote). <br /><br />At one point, speaker Herb Titus held up a copy of Kevin Phillips&#39; &quot;American Theocracy,&quot; offering it as evidence of the putative war on Christians. It was an audacious move, given that Sara Diamond, the preeminent scholar of the Christian right, reported in a 1998 book that Titus was forced to resign his post as dean of the law school at Pat Robertson&#39;s Regent University because he refused to renounce Christian Reconstructionism. Christian Reconstructionism is a theocratic sect that advocates the replacement of civil law with biblical law, including the execution of homosexuals, apostates and women who are unchaste before marriage. Christian Reconstructionists used to be politically radioactive, but a new generation of religious right leaders like Scarborough have embraced them, and some members of today&#39;s GOP apparently see no problem associating with them. This does not mean that America is on the verge of theocracy, but it signals an important shift. The language of religious authoritarianism has become at least somewhat politically acceptable.&#39;

				I am not that quick when it comes to politics, so I have to work through this stuff very slowly.<br /><br />1.&nbsp; It seems that the fringe far-right is being catered to by the GOP, even some of the members of the GOP who are probably more moderate in their personal beliefs, for the sake of votes.<br /><br />2.&nbsp; When did these bastards steal the morality card?&nbsp; And why do we let them keep it?<br /><br />3.&nbsp; It seems that not enough people know too much about the fringe far right and and take them seriously.&nbsp; <br /><br />4.&nbsp; I&#39;m with Bruce Bawers, who believes that we should engage in polite dialogue with the christian right to learn more about what is really going on before the rug comes out from under us.&nbsp; Not that he phrased it in quite those terms... I&#39;ll have to look for his book.&nbsp; Hang on until I get back.

				If Jesus was here today, the GOP and fundamentalists would brand him a liberal lefty pinko.&nbsp; he certainly wouldnt work into their plans.<br /><br />I just cant see Jesus getting behind government control, spying, televangelism, hate mongering, and my favorite;&nbsp; telling people to go to war and kill, rape, pillage in his name.<br /><br /><br />Im pretty certain Jesus was a cool, caring, compassionate sort of guy.
