				Hi all, &nbsp;am wondering if anybody out there wants to play chess on a regular basis, i just checked out freezepeach.org place, and it is very well suited,. if you are into chess, let me know which nights are good and perhaps we can start a weekly or monthly thing.

				That's really amazing. I was in the FrozenPeach Sunday night for the first time and thought the same thing. I live right around the corner for almost six years and it is the coolest and closest thing to come in a while. I believe I've even had a pair of shoes dyed by the shoe repair guy who used to be there.........but I digress terribly, my Chess skills are a bit rusty, I just bought a chess tutor for my laptop to improve.<br /><br />I have a tournament vinyl/rollup board and tournament weighted pieces that I would be happy to bring over....my play, alas is not tournament...more like the U.S. Ryder cup

				Sounds good. Sometimes I don't get out from work in Manhattan until 7:30 PM...But 8:30 would certainly seem dooable...do you have enough small tables for game boards?

				Hi all, &nbsp;I'm new to this board and recently moved here to Astoria.<br />I'm passionate about chess and am looking to improve my game.<br />I would love to join you people on Tuesdays but my schedule right now<br />is <em>clogged</em>. &nbsp;I ususally play chess at Volo Cafe [28-09 Ditmars Blvd nr. that big church] on Saturdays. &nbsp;You can find me there between 3 pm<br />and 5 pm and if I'm not playing anyone I have the board set up anyway,<br />so don't be shy! &nbsp;P.S. This is a great board. &nbsp;See you soon.

				Does Volo have those tables with the built in chess board patterns like....(eewwwww...) starbucks does?<br />It seems a little tight in there.<br />I'll be working this Sat. 10/2. A Dr. I work with (who is a very good chess player) will be playing at Central Park near the Bethesda Fountain, it's supposed to be a big chess deal. Check it out on line.

				No, Mridude, &nbsp;Volo doesn't have the built in table/board but they do have<br />a number of boards (e.g. a wood one with algebraic notation that I<br />particularly like) as well as some other games (though I don't know which).<br />As far as playing in Central Park, although I consider myself a passably<br />well chess player I'm not quite ready yet to be utterly humiliated &nbsp;:) &nbsp;as<br />usually the players in the park tend to be very very good. &nbsp;I don't mind<br />loosing however (I learn something every time I do) and I <em>never</em> play<br />for money, although I do sometimes for cookies :twisted: .<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I can play backgammon too, though I'm not really good at that game at<br />all, but I admit it's a great as well as addictive game. &nbsp;See you soon!

				It's not just grizzled grand masters. This is one of those egalitarian events.<br />http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_things_to_do/upcoming_events/events.php?id=20008<br /><br />I am trying to streamline my Sat. work schedule to at least see the later part of the event.<br />&nbsp;I know what you mean about the park chess lifers at the chess and checker house, or just about any park with a chess table.<br /><br />Anyway, afterwards I will be heading down, possibly with a friend to the Chess Shop at 230 Thompson ST. in the west village. ( West 4th street train stop) to get a chess set for my brother and possibly play.<br /><br />http://www.chess-shop.com/aboutus.htm

				Thanks for the links Mridude, I was always curious where exactly that Chess Shop was. &nbsp;Would the computer chess tutor that you mentioned in an earlier post &nbsp;happen to be &quot;Chestmaster 10th Edition&quot;, for I heard alot of good things about that program (specifically the walk-through tutorial written in collaboration with some famous masters) &nbsp; When I asked someone who regularly kicks my ass at the game what I should do to improve mine he said to go through that tutorial 4 or 5 times.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;As it is, I've recently purchased one of those electronic boards for about 30 bucks or so at Toys R Us because I like the tactile sensation of the pieces (when I play the computer my eyes tend to cross after awhile) &nbsp;The game has different levels of difficulty; &nbsp;when I consistently win against one (10 out of 15 games let's say) I move onto the next. &nbsp;Right now I've had time enough to beat level 5, but there are 73 different levels!<br />&nbsp; The only disadvantage of the game is that when you play black you have to move from the other side of the board (which I consider an advantage, 'cause it trains you to view the game from the opponents p.o.v.) &amp; I switch sides every game regardless of whether I record a win, loss or stale.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The upper end boards use signal lights instead of a digital readout but I<br />think I like this way better.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Hope you have fun in Manhattan, see you soon!<br /><br />P.S. : Can anyone tell me how to indent paragraphs while posting, for I<br />am hotmetal illiterate?

				Don't feel bad, I think that computers tend to go out of date before you even<br />buy them. &nbsp;I always hold onto mine however because there are alot of classic<br />programs (ahemm, I mean games) that can only be played on the older systems. &nbsp;Does DOS bring to mind any fond memories?

				For all chess lovers, here's something we did for one of our school projects:<br /><br />http://design.schoolofvisualarts.edu/chess/<br /><br />The quality of pictures doesn't do justice to the details spent in making them. Some of them are large scale, like the bowling one is like 2x2 meters. Mine is the NY street, which 90% I made from scratch. Just a little eye candy! Thanks
