				I&#039;m new to Astoria and looking for a cafe nearby that serves good coffee (preferably free refills) and doesn&#039;t mind someone who hangs out for a couple hours (looking for a place to study/read/do crosswords/knit).&nbsp; I&#039;ve looked around and so far haven&#039;t had much luck.&nbsp; Either the coffee&#039;s been terrible or they want to push you out after 20 minutes.&nbsp; I live on 35th Ave. and 33rd St.

				Welcome to your new home. The best advise is to find a Greek/Euro cafe where you can sit for hours and just have 1 cup of coffee.&nbsp; But most of these places are around Broadway and 30th ave.&nbsp; Believe it or not but Panera breads on 35th ave and 38th street has comfy seating, decent coffee and foods, free wifi and plenty of room. I&#039;ve seen kids studying, people on laptops working and so on.&nbsp; Another great place is cafe Bar on 34th ave and 36th street.&nbsp; More Bohemian and a local establishment (non franchise). Not sure about free wifi or hanging out policy but during summer months people stay at outside seating all day and no one complains. Should be that same inside.<br /><br />Good luck and enjoy the neighborhood, it&#039;s wonderful here.

				Panera Bread<br />3801 35th Avenue<br />Astoria, NY 11101<br /><br />They sell you the empty cup and you can get as many the free refills as your bladder can handle. <br /><br />Some really comfy chairs.<br /><br />PLUS THERE&#039;S FREE WIFI!

				depending on where you sit, from what I remember, Omonia does refills on their regular coffee. I like the window seats for people watching. The closer you are to the inside, the more Vegas it gets.

				I tried Cafe Bar once and trying to read inside is impossible.&nbsp; It is way too dark, ie too much ambiance.&nbsp; I used to go to Kolonaki Cafe across from Omonia. It was nice because it was always empty and I could sit upstairs and not be bothered for hours.&nbsp; I guess that&#039;s why it closed down.<br />Haven&#039;t had much luck elsewhere although I might check out the Panera&#039;s now.
