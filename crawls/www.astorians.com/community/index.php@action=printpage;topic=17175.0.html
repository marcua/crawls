				Finally had a minute to give you a heads up on the place. Steinway and 23rd<br />I purchased a harness for the dog and on the second day it broke, went back they replace it. Broke again on the same spot so I went back to get my $28 back and the owner refused to refund me or even replace it! <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;ll stick with Jumping Bull Dog!!!!!!!!!!!

				As the owner of a very feisty, high energy,&nbsp; Husky / Shepherd / Labrador Mixed puppy, I am all too well aware of how hard it is to select the most durable and safe leash. My puppy went through 5 leashes in her first year, and they weren&#039;t cheap on the wallet either!&nbsp; One broke while I was in the park with her and thank goodness she didn&#039;t run out into the traffic. Another one scratched the top of her nose so bad that her fur came off. And they were all from Petco! While looking to replace the last leash my little rascal wear and tear through, I decided to take my pup with me and check out the new store in my neighborhood My Little Buddy Pet Boutique.&nbsp; The ladies there were so incredibly helpful and they educated me on selecting the right leash. When I used to go to Petco and other chain pet supply stores, I had the mentality that one leash fits all, at least that was the attitude I got from the sales personnel that worked at those stores. All I can say is that I experienced the best customer service whenever I visit My Little Buddy Pet Boutique, they remember my name and my pup&#039;s after the first visit and they&#039;ve always gone out of their way in helping me select the right food, snack and most recently the right collar for my pup. Sorry to hear about your bad experience, it really does sound out of character to me. Good luck on your future shopping expeditions for your dog.

				MS. LittleBuddy, <br />After having had gone there for 3 times with the issue, and not getting any &quot;customer service&quot; (on the contrary), we don&#039;t plan on ever stepping foot in your store. The last thing I told you or your employee (partner, whoever she was) was that i was going to customer affairs and bringing it to the community. Perhaps you don&#039;t remember because it was the last week of October. But I am sure you remember now. I also told you I was in sales and that I would never let a customer leave unhappily, you did.<br />In case you still don&#039;t remember it was an Orange Harness that doesn&#039;t have a brand but still has your price tag on it $24.99 made in China! You said you sold so many and never had an issue. SURE! :-o<br />We went to Petco got a Gentle Leader for our 20lb Cocker, that worked like a charm. As for our boutique shopping we will continue to visit the friendly professional people that try hard to do the right thing, because we do like to support small business in our community. :mrgreen:

				Sometimes you get one chance to make a good impression and shilling on the message board is not going to make that go away.&nbsp; Even if the store owner or employee was having a bad day, they should have a clear policy on returns or at least make an effort to resolve the issue.<br /><br />Maybe the leash is too small for the dog or maybe the leash in construction or design is defective, but what matters is not letting the customer go away with something that is broken.<br /><br />Running a business like a local pet store is really about relationships and loyalty, in so much the customer can feel confident to go back and shop for additional pet supplies time and again.&nbsp; The retail environment is a very competitive with online shopping, big big box retailers and chains.

				Am I missing something? I thought this site had a good reputation as a resource for unbiased information about local businesses and as a voice for the community. YES I am a new register on this site, hence the first time posting before as someone pointed out...correct me if I&#039;m wrong, but is my credibility or opinion being questioned because of this? Are newcomers not welcomed to voice their opinions? Honestly, for the sake of this site being an unbiased, community oriented resource, let&#039;s show proper respect for each other&#039;s opinion. The sarcasm and snide remarks lessens the integrity of the site and frankly, does nothing to improve or aid our judgement on local businesses. I would appreciate that the sharing my post, which is from my personal experience at Little Buddy&#039;s Pet Boutique be respected just as I respect everyone&#039;s sharing of their PERSONAL experience. I am not presumptuous to assume that everyone would agree with me as I do not agree with everyone, but I do respect them, nonetheless, and I would appreciate the same respect in return - minus the assumptions &amp; belittling, thank you very much. If you have any direct questions please ask me and if you prefer to share with the rest of the community, please communicate clearly and not make your comments seem like an inside joke. And let me clarify myself, the ladies were incredibly helpful in recommending the right food for my pup because she was suffering from digestive problems which is no laughing matter. I suggest Mr. Geo that you should go take up the owner&#039;s offer to straighten everything out directly at their store. Obviously you are upset with the situation and have very strong opinions regarding the matter still, though I&#039;m not disputing your experience since I was not personally there to witness the event, since obviously you and the owner are communicating on this post, you might as well do it face to face, otherwise this is becoming a war of words on here and a &quot;he said&quot; &quot;she said&quot; situation. Doesn&#039;t resolve anything.

				QueenofAstoria, regardless of whether or not you are affiliated with the store, people&#039;s suspicions are going to be raised, because of the weird coincidence that two separate people just randomly signed up on this site and their first post ever is to support the store.&nbsp; Yes, this does bring up a credibility issue and it does happen on this site and others just like it.&nbsp; If you had a history on this site, commenting on other issues, then posters would know your reputation more and give it more weight.&nbsp; The posts did sound like a standard corporate shill and it&#039;s only understandable that people would question it.<br /><br />This argument is getting nowhere fast and I&#039;d suggest everyone move on.&nbsp; None of this is reflecting well on anyone.&nbsp; This issue is between the OP and the store, and right now, it can&#039;t help but come off as a rant on both sides.&nbsp; &nbsp;- mod

I have lived in Astoria for more than 5 years, active member of the community and have heavily relied upon this site as a reliable resource.&nbsp; Upon this latest experience with this forum, I now clearly understand the community structure of this forum, clearly some unfortunate few would rather continue with assuming and accusations and for that reason, I will not subject myself nor encourage such behavior by participating future. Geo good luck on resolving your issue. To all, enjoy. <br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Jeez, you are super defensive for someone who is trying to become part of our community.&nbsp; Definitely not helping your case.&nbsp; BTW, daisy was pretty unbiased and straightforward in her reply.&nbsp; She told you very clearly why people are hesitant to trust you.&nbsp; From what I can tell, nobody has actually even accused you of anything.<br /><br />Does anyone have a link to the thread about the nail salon where there were a bunch of fake posts praising the place?&nbsp; Maybe that would give our newer members some perspective.

				For what it&#039;s worth the moderators and admin regularly look to see if people are posting using multiple accounts to self promote. Technically speaking that doesn&#039;t appear to be the case here. There&#039;s a reasonable chance that all thread participants are giving their honest opinions.
