				I&#039;m interested in learning a bit about baking, and was wondering if anyone here is a home baker that wouldn&#039;t mind letting me hang around and watch how it&#039;s done once in a while. I wanted to make myself some home baked bread, but found myself a bit overwhelmed with techniques I was unfamiliar with (how in the world am I supposed to know when the dough is &quot;too moist?&quot;), and equipment I had never even heard of (baking stone? pizza peel?), so I thought it might be smart to turn to a more experienced person before I attempt this on my own. I&#039;m not really looking for actual lessons, just an opportunity to watch someone who knows what they&#039;re doing, and hopefully ask a few questions.<br />Thanks.<br />Avi

				hi there! i am certainly not an experienced baker, but i&#039;ve recently gotten into baking my own bread as well. i always used a bread machine, but mine died and i didn&#039;t want to buy a new one. this website is really helpful: http://www.thefreshloaf.com/<br /><br />they actually have a series of lessons set up. i just finished lesson 2 and both of my loafs came out really nice. also make sure you read the comments on the posts, there&#039;s a bunch of good information there. i hope that this helps!

				I&#039;m curious to know what other occasional bakers store their flour in.&nbsp; The original bag, by itself, would be too messy, wrapping it in a grocery store bag isn&#039;t visually appealing, and the platic box I bought to put the flour in contibutes to the flour have a somewhat stale smell.&nbsp; I have very little space to store the flour (originally a 5 lb bag).&nbsp; The plastic box is at least stackable.

				Regarding measuring, that&#039;s true for cakes and such, but it&#039;s not particularly true for bread, except for the flour/water ratio. Yeast is much more tolerant of variation than are chemical leaveners.<br /><br />Here&#039;s my standby memorized bread recipe. Proportions are perfect for a bread machine too.<br /><br />13.3 oz (by weight) flour (bread flour or King Arthur all-purpose and/or whole wheat bread flour)<br />1 c water at about 100 F<br />1 t yeast<br />1 t salt<br />1 T vegetable oil<br /><br />1. Stir yeast into warm water and let sit until dissolved (takes longer with non-instant yeast). Meanwhile, mix flour(s) and salt with a whisk in a big bowl. <br />2. Make a hole in the flour and pour in yeast mixture and oil. Mix with a spoon until a thick dough. Knead for 3-10 minutes. The more you knead, the more the gluten will develop. Sometimes you want a bread with less bubbles, like when making dinner rolls, so knead less in that case.<br />3. Lightly oil another large bowl, put dough in that bowl and turn to cover with oil. Cover with a clean dish towel and let sit in an 80 degree spot for an hour or so.<br />4. When springy, punch down, then let rest 10 minutes. Form into the shape you&#039;d like (there are specific techniques for doing this, but they&#039;re hard to describe), put on a baking sheet dusted with flour, cover with the dish towel, and let rise again, maybe 45 minutes.<br />5. Preheat oven to 375 F. Heat up a 12&quot; cast iron skillet and invert it inside the oven, on an oven rack near the bottom of the oven. (Ersatz baking stone!) <br />6. Put the bread on the baking sheet onto the inverted hot skillet, spray the inside of the oven walls with a few squirts of water from a spray bottle, close the oven. Wait two minutes. Spray the walls again. This creates steam which condenses on the cold bread dough, preventing it from forming a thick dry crust. You want a crisp crust instead. <br />7. Bake for 30-60 minutes, depending on the shape of the loaf, until browned and hollow-sounding if you knock the bottom. Let cool almost completely before slicing. Serve with good quality lightly salted butter.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=17045.msg187936.html#msg187936">Quote from: Yaxpac on January 21, 2010, 08:54:44 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I love bread and recently tried baking my own.&nbsp; I used to have a bread maker and while the bread was decent to good, it was lacking something.<br /><br />I have minimal experience baking but my mother is an expert baker.&nbsp; According to her and most other bakers...the key is measuring to exact specs.&nbsp; Much different than &quot;cooking&quot;.&nbsp; <br /><br />I tried making this no-knead bread from Jim Lahey (Sullivan St Bakery):<br />http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/08/dining/081mrex.html<br /><br />There is a slightly modified version on the Cooks Illustrated website.&nbsp; I actually used this version but you need a subscription to read it.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have to say, my bread came out incredible and was bakery quality.&nbsp; I was amazed how easy it was.&nbsp; It just takes a long time since you have to let it sit for so long.&nbsp; <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Harlan, I&#039;m going to try your recipe.&nbsp; Soon.&nbsp; Thanks for posting it. :mrgreen:<br /><br />I have made challah and it has always come out well.&nbsp; I need to make it again.&nbsp; It&#039;s so good for french toast, too!<br /><br />I commend the people here who want to learn to make bread.&nbsp; I grew up in a home where we had fresh bread weekly, and it&#039;s really a special thing.<br /><br />Do most bakers here use their oven for their rising (that&#039;s what I was taught), or do you have other suggestions as to good places for rising?
