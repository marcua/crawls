				I received this email from Queens Padeia School about new afterschool programs in LIC:&nbsp; <br /><br />Two great after-school classes will be happening at the Queens Paideia School this fall. They were designed by educators and parents, with an eye on the quality of the learning experience.<br /><br />•&nbsp; &nbsp;Classes start week of Sept. 20<br />•&nbsp; &nbsp;Location: QPS at the LIC Arts Center, 44-02 23rd Street (near the Citicorp Bldg).<br />•&nbsp; &nbsp;To register, contact tqps@earthlink.net<br />•&nbsp; &nbsp;Visit QPS online at www.queenspaideiaschool.org<br /><br />Repurposed Inspirations&nbsp; Fiber, plastic, glass, and art media morph into works of fine art (sculpture, collages, vases) and now-usable items as students gain an understanding of where things come from and where they can still go. It is through this connection that our next generation will see the potential for purpose and beauty all around them. An exhibition of completed works will be held in December.<br />&nbsp;<br />With Alyssa Ratkewitch, master’s in art &amp; education from Pratt Institute and QPS art instructor. She also teaches at the Dalton School.<br /><br />Ages 5–7, Thurs 3:30–4:30 PM in Studio 214A<br />Ages 8+, Thurs 4:30–5:30 PM in Studio 214A<br />Cost: $240 for 12 weeks<br /><br />Writers Workshop&nbsp; &nbsp;This workshop engages participants in writing as a process and a way of exploring the world. Students will write poetry, fiction, and essays, and learn to self-assess and peer edit as they draft and re-draft their work. By workshop’s end, students will view writing as an extension of their thinking and playing rather than as an academic exercise.<br /><br />With Martha Witt, MFA in fiction writing (NYU) and PhD in English education (Teachers College, Columbia); professor of Creative Writing at William Paterson Univ., author of the novel Broken as Things Are; recipient of numerous fellowships.<br /><br />Ages 8–12, Thurs 3:30–4:30 PM in Studio 214<br />Cost: $200 for 10 weeks (no class 10/7, 12/2)<br />
