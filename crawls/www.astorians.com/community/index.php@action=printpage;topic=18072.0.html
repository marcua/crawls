				I wanted to check this place out for my son.&nbsp; I called a month ago and spoke to an extremely unfriendly gentleman.&nbsp; I persisted in the conversation but found the hours of operation don&#039;t work for our family.&nbsp; <br /><br />I really wanted to speak with another person to let them know their phone person was very gruff. <br /><br />My husband - not knowing that I&#039;d already called - also called and had a similar incident on the phone.&nbsp; My husband didn&#039;t persist - instead he hung up on the man.&nbsp; <br /><br />so a note to Little Angels: please talk to the person who answers your phone.&nbsp; He is not setting a warm friendly tone for a daycare.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also I was wondering if it would be possible that you could take a child as early as 7:30 am?&nbsp; <br />

				Jennifer,<br /><br />i just wanted to send a quick note about your post in regards to Little Angels. The gentleman who answers the phone is a very reserved person by nature. He is born in a different country, in a different time, and, no, he does not have the polite, cheerful phone manners that Americans expect. But he is really sweet. He is not the one running the daycare. His wife is, and she is the one who is a Montessori-certified teacher, with over 7 years of teaching and caring for children. However, her husband always helps with the strollers, with other little tasks of getting children in and out of the house. He is very gentle. My son is extremely suspicious and cautious by nature, but he loves both the teacher and her husband, asks about them when he is not there.<br /><br />I recommend that you go to the open house and meet the teacher herself. It is a family daycare, and it may be possible to set the hours that are convenient for you. So far they have been very accommodating. But it is best to talk to them in person.<br /><br />Also, if you have a Facebook account, you can look up Little Angels Montessori, Inc. there. You will see the pictures of their place, of the backyard.<br /><br />I am not sure how old/young your son is, but for a small child, this is a very good option. your child will get individualized attention, but you will also get individualized attention. the teacher even helps with potty-training (if that is a concern).<br /><br />Good luck!!

				Hi Jennifer,<br /><br />My 22 months daughter is also getting looked after at Little Angels Montessori. At that time, they didn&#039;t have an Astorian&#039;s account, so I voluntarily posted this Open House Ad for a little support and to save their time.<br /><br />I was really disappointed to read how you got the &quot;extremely unfriendly man&quot; impression over the phone... and the worse part is, that as a result you&#039;re spreading his reputation as if &quot;He is not setting a warm friendly tone for a daycare.&quot; <br /><br />He&#039;s not an &quot;extremely unfriendly gentleman&quot; over the phoneâ€¦ as &quot;elenacoln&quot; posted, he is a man who is from another country and has different culture from Americans. I am not from this country either so my English may not be clear enough, but so does many other people living here in New York and we are all trying hard to co-exist by respecting and understanding others. But sometimes I face conflicts that drives me nuts, too. So, I do understand you and your husband&#039;s frustration from this type of experience. <br /><br />But if you&#039;re expecting something like, &quot;people who run daycare should have very friendly attitude over the phone&quot;, and therefore making a judgment even before seeing the actual place and meeting them in person, you may be losing your (and your child&#039;s) opportunity in very unlucky way.<br /><br />If you&#039;re looking for a quality daycare, which provides informative education by solid Montessori skills, I&#039;m positively confident to write clearly that this is one of the best daycare place you may be able to find in this neighborhood.<br /><br />You can also try calling this number: 347-249-1454<br /><br />The director&#039;s name is Ms. Roohi Saleh.<br /><br />Good luck :)

				Jennifer,<br /><br />Sorry for feeling that my tone was not up to your expectation.<br />We are parents too and understand your feelings. Like the parents have explained that ours is a home based<br />family daycare and we have a daughter who we have to drop off to school before 8 am so for that reason we are unable to provide any services before that time.<br />You are welcome to come on our open house and meet the provider.
