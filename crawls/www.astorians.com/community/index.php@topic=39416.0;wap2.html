			Hell0 - Our son got into the district g&amp;t program at ps85 for kindergarten this fall.<br /><br />My husband and i don&#039;t know too much about this school, so we were wondering<br />if anyone could provide some insight. <br /><br />Not about the school in general, but specifically about the g&amp;t program there.-<br /><br />Thank you in advance.<br />

			I would recommend joining the District 30 Education group which would have a ton of people who could provide feedback on this. My understanding is that it&#039;s a great program.<br /><br /><br />https://www.facebook.com/groups/337290243048093/
