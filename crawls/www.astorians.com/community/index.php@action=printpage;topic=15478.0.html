				Hello all, my roommate will be gone for 9 months for a job so we I need a roommate temporarily. The apartment is a very large 2 bedroom, ground level with large windows. Lots of closet space and a large kitchen. We have laundry in the building. The location is 27th street off of 24th avenue- about a 5 minute walk from the Astoria Blvd stop on the N/W. I am looking for a nonsmoker and someone who is relatively quiet as I am a student and need to study a lot. The apartment is furnished but you would need a bed as my roommate is taking his. The bedroom could also been completely cleaned out if you have your our bedroom furniture. The room is about 15 x 15- very large with 2 windows. The rent is $850 plus half of utilities- for internet and coned about $60 to $80 for each person depending on how much you run your AC. We are not technically supposed to have pets but the previous tenant had 2 cats so if you have a cat we may be able to accommodate you. The rent may be negotiable. <br /><br />A little about me, as I said I am a student. I am a 28 year old female, nonsmoker. I work and go to school so I am in and out quite a bit. Please do not be a total slob as I am not. <br /><br />Fellow Astorians- if you know someone who is not on this listserve who is looking for a place, please forward this info. I will need someone to vouch for a potential subleter&#039;s honesty and ability to pay the rent. Thanks!<br /><br />
