			Hmmm. Interesting articles. I&#39;ve always thought that foie gras was very cruel - if admittedly a small part of animal cruelty as a whole. Not sure that I&#39;m totally convinved otherwise, but something to think about.

			the reason i avoid beef for the most part is&nbsp; because of what I have seen for all the years that i would commute the seven hour drive between LA and Santa Cruz...<br /><br />There&#39;s this huge industrial cattle ranch just off the interstate 5 somewhere between the junction with the 99 and Los Banos (yes people, there is a town called &quot;the bathrooms&quot; in california but that&#39;s off topic)<br />the stink is to high heaven, the cows just look off color and well i&#39;ve spotted dead carcasses too. no way i&#39;m eatin&#39; that sh*t.<br /><br />besides, cows consume the largest amount of grain on the planet and that again is a whole separate thread.

Not that I did any investigative under-cover journalism, but the cattle seemed healthy and content and had plenty of grass and space and usually a creek or pond to drink from/wade in.
