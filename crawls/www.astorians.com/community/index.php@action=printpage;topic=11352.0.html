				As much as I&#039;d love to bash the gay community, I won&#039;t b/c I&#039;ll respect their choice - I think we&#039;ve all noticed that they are flooding the Astoria area by large margins. <br /><br />But my problem is with the transexuals parading around hotspots like Steinway St. and whatnot. It is VERY VERY DISTURBING. Often times, they are extremely loud and obnoxious and at the PM hours they can be violent. Seeing as how they&#039;ve been stopped by the police numerous times. Aside from that little clique that they have. There are lots of others moving in daily....<br /><br />I find this extremely haunting for all residents in Astoria and even worse for the children who are witnesses to this alarming rise. <br /><br />&nbsp;:-o :x

				Sounds rather alarmist to me.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t noticed any such influx, and I fail to see why it would be bothersome if there were.&nbsp; As long as people aren&#039;t breaking the law, why can&#039;t you live and let live?&nbsp; If they&#039;re being noisy, call 311.&nbsp; If they&#039;re doing illicit things, call the cops.&nbsp; Other than that, you just have to live with your neighbors, transsexuals and all.

				I take it, you guys have not noticed them as of yet LOL because 9 times out of 10 when you walk past them they have something to say to you...(that&#039;s just one particular group)<br /><br />I don&#039;t mean to come off sounding ignorant but you would know what I mean once you seen them.

				A trannie who runs up to you or your kids with his &quot;nuts hanging out&quot; is not cool, but that is his fault, not all transvestites. <br /><br />Just like if a white man robs you it is HIS fault, not all white men.<br /><br />And your comments wouldnt have sounded nearly as ignorant and biggoted if you didn&#039;t start with the statement &quot;As much as I&#039;d love to bash the gay community.&quot;<br /><br />That just makes everything else you say totally biased and naive.

				Crudeness, rudeness, general offense behavior is not ever isolated to a particular group (ethnic, socio-economic, religious, alt lifestyle, etc)... &nbsp;It is ALWAYS unfair to generalize. <br /><br />I have heard equally nasty comments out of the mouths of teenagers, suited-up Wall Streeters, even distiguished philanthropists at charity events.... <br /><br /><br />I really hope that all the press about Carmens Place doesnt bring out the bashers....that would be a shame. <br /><br />My husband and I have lived all over Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn and we chose Astoria because of its diversity. We are at the age that we are going to have to make the &quot;procreation decision&quot; in the next 5 years and wanted to move somewhere that a child would be exposed to a wealth of differences.<br /><br />

				Hi All-<br /><br />&nbsp;I locked the thread. I was concerned with the direction the thread was going and was at work and not able to keep a proper eye on it. I should have put a comment up saying why- but to be honest I was in a rush to sign off.

				Yea, I found it odd that the thread was locked and I was never even able to explain myself after everybody shot me down so quick. People took the topic the wrong way and misread a basic observation that I posted which is based on actual facts, statistics and evidence. I don&#039;t want to get in a whole thing with this. Maybe AJ can post up the PM I sent him explaining as to why I said what was said originally. I can&#039;t seem to find the message in my outbox. <br /><br />But yea...I think I rustled some feathers, when it was never meant to in the first place.
