				I remember from an earlier thread that there were several posters that lived on 28 Street between Hoyt Avenue to 20 Avenue.&nbsp; There are so many different issues that affect this block from the noise and crowds of the Beer Garden, the litter and mess on Hoyt Avenue along with general sanitation issues throughout the block, to wanting permits for block parties. <br /><br />If we were organized, our voices are more likely to be heard.&nbsp; Is there anyone else out there that might be interested in putting together a small block association to deal with these issues?&nbsp; <br /><br />Thought we could put together a small meeting in January?

				I envision it being more of a block association where residents can voice their concerns about issues that we face together.

				Costa do you recall someone tried to shut down the beer garden twenty years ago? Thank God they failed.<br /><br />I hope conflict with that beloved neighborhood institution will not be one of the sticking points that arise from your group.<br /><br />Areas around Athens Square have a lot more problems with everything from traffic, litter, and noise.

				I never advocated to close the beer garden, only sure there are better ways of doing things that the neighbors are not disturbed.&nbsp; There are so many issues that each part of our neighborhood face that are unique to their geography.&nbsp; Block associations allow neighbors to come together and deal with those unique issues.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would not argue with you that the residents by Athens square have their own set of issues.&nbsp; Would be happy to work with anyone in our community to make sure their voices are heard.&nbsp;
