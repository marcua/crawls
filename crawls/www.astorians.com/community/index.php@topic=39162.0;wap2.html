			“Elliman Report: Manhattan, Brooklyn &amp; Queens Rentals” <br /><br />We have just released the “Elliman Report: Manhattan, Brooklyn &amp; Queens Rentals” for January 2016, the leading resource on the state of the rental market.&nbsp; As always, our market reports are produced in conjunction with Miller Samuel to provide you and your clients with the most comprehensive and neutral market insight available. <br /><br />Although Manhattan rents were higher than last year, they are not rising as quickly.&nbsp; Landlords are offering more concessions than they have in a number of years and rental price trends tended to be weaker at the top of the market.&nbsp; <br /><br />Market-wide Brooklyn rents were up only slightly after a few months with weaker trends. The new development boom has shifted offerings to larger apartments and inventory has increased. <br /><br />Rental prices in Northwest Queens showed mixed results this month as the luxury market remained weaker than the overall market.&nbsp; While marketing time declined, negotiability increased. <br /><br />At Douglas Elliman, we are constantly looking for ways to provide our clients with better information, empowering them to make more informed decisions. Our efforts to create this market report series reflect our strong belief that access to timely information is a vital resource in a market that is constantly changing. Committed to providing the best information in the industry, we are proud to offer this service to our clients.
