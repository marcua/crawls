				Reading these messages is making my mouth water!&nbsp; Come to think of it, I need to find a spot for decent Mexican food, in general, in my area (48th St. and Broadway)<br /><br />I&#039;m not saying that it was necessarily good nacho grande, but I used to get mine from that Tex-Mex place on 30th Avenue and 21st Street, when I lived on 25th Road.&nbsp; When I moved to 36th Avenue and 32nd Street, I used to have them and a big fat chicken and steak burrito delivered.<br /><br />

				OK this was my post so i&#039;m setting a few rules.<br /><br />1. Cheesy piles of Nacho goodness are meant to be eaten in a bar/restaurant setting. Not as a hippy activity in the park with sunshine and flowers.<br /><br />2. Margaritas are served in anything but a thermos post high school era parties at the beach.<br /><br />3. A Nacho grande should have at least 5-8 toppings and come with an excessive amount of napkins.<br /><br />4. Nacho grande platter should be bigger than your head.<br /><br />4. Refer to rule #1.

				do your rules allow for those folks who LOVE nachos but don&#039;t eat red meat and therefore would avoid the chili/ground beef element? they can still be messy, just slightly less than their fully loaded counterpart.

				I&#039;ve had the nachos at McCanns, and would only order them again if I was drunk and my decision making process was impaired.&nbsp; They were just...blah.&nbsp; I think the badly, partially melted bright orange cheddar was the worst part.<br /><br />I think Sunswick does a loaded nachos.<br /><br />daisy is right - every Mexican place will be packed on Cinco de Mayo!&nbsp; However, that doesn&#039;t mean vying for a spot at a Mexican restaurant is a bad idea that day...&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />I bet Tacos Mexico has a great nacho platter.

				Does anyone know of a good, authentic Mexican restaurant where a large group could gather for Cinco de Mayo? &nbsp;Does anyone else go to those little &quot;madre &amp; padre&quot; restaurants that are so prevalent and seldom visited in Astoria? &nbsp;Similar to other ethnic cuisine, I&#039;m quite certain that despite they don&#039;t get a lot of publicity, they might be the best bet in the city. &nbsp;I once read an article in the NY Times about Mexican owned delis in the city that served the best Mexican food!<br /><br />Anyway, you can count me in if there is a group outing on Cinco de Mayo!

				There was a place in college that sold a wondrous thing called &quot;trash can nachos&quot; because they were served on a trash-can lid. As in one of those big metal trash cans. Of course the lid was clean. And lined with paper, if I remember correctly. And they were delicious. Served 10 or somesuch.<br /><br />Unfortunately you gotta go to Texas to find such wondrous things as this.<br /><br />I wonder if the Red Hook ballfields would have something like this...

				MandaT - those trash can nachos sound awesome!&#160; I wish we could find something like that around here.<br /><br />I think of nachos as more American than anything else, honestly, or maybe Tex-Mex, so real &quot;Mexican&quot; authenticity would be counterproductive.&#160; I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever seen them on a menu in Mexico, at least in the small towns I go to.&#160; I&#039;ve never been to a well-known tourist area in Mexico, or near to the border with Texas.&nbsp; (I am NOT saying that loaded nachos are inappropriate for Cinco de Mayo, btw!)<br /><br />(Ah.&#160; Tex-Mex (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignacio_Anaya).)

				I&#039;ve actually only been there once.&nbsp; I had a tasty taco al pastor.&nbsp; I hear they have a good nacho &quot;appetizer&quot;, which apparently is more than an appetizer.&nbsp; I imagine they have margaritas, but not positive.&nbsp; I think mcdirk has eaten there a number of times.&nbsp; mcdirk?<br /><br />It&#039;s on Broadway near 34th Street.&nbsp; It&#039;s a sit down place.<br /><br />De Mole (http://brooklyn.citysearch.com/profile/44539025/sunnyside_ny/de_mole.html) in Sunnyside might also fit the bill.

				I&#039;ve had the nachos at el Mariachi. not lovin them. not at all.<br />the tortas, yummerific as well as some of the dinner plates (i don&#039;t eat red meat and pork so i can&#039;t vouch for all but the chicken is good).<br />But i was highly disappointed in their nachos.<br /><br />are we looking for mexican nachos or the tex mex kind. <br />perhaps i didn&#039;t enjoy mariachi&#039;s nachos as much b.c i prefer tex mex nachos. but i&#039;ve had better mexican nachos.

				I think the only way to solve this to make one&#039;s own! (Velveeta + rotel) + salsa + bag of tostitos = YUM-O (as Rachel Ray would say)<br /><br />Of course you can add in whatever else you like - ground beef, peppers, sour cream, guac. This is coming from a Texan, by the way, so adjust for local favorites...

				I&#039;m just not so sure there&#039;s a place that serves &quot;Tex-Mex&quot; style Nachos.&nbsp; Our places are good for an authentic Mexican taco, but not so much for good old US-style Nachos.&nbsp; <br /><br />I personally vote for being outside and there aren&#039;t any restaurants that have that capability - the requirements being nachos and margaritas.

				Went to El Cantinero last night and it should definitely be considered for a nacho/margarita fest.&nbsp; Nice rooftop patio, decent margaritas and food.

I just think his &quot;goofy&quot; shtick detracts from what he&#039;s talking about. Just my opinion. Anthony Bourdain did a great bit on nachos on his No Reservations show. He actually went to the spot that the Nacho was invented and was quite disappointed with what they served him. Basically, it was a skimpy plate of tortilla chips with a little bit of melted cheese on top. Not the gargantuan TGIF plate that could feed an army (Crisp tortillas topped with bacon-flavored refried beans, spicy nacho meat and cheese. Served with pico de gallo, guacamole, sour cream and jalapeños).<br />

				Speaking of taco crawls, we&#039;re diggin&#039; Athens Grill on 30th Ave across from Trade Fair. Don&#039;t let the name fool you--it&#039;s AUTHENTIC Mexican, which is not always pretty, but tasty nonetheless. Anyway, we stopped in the other night around 10:30 on our way home from Zlata Praha (sp?), our fav neighborhood Czech bar, and the place was PACKED. The restaurant part was filled with, from what I could tell, all Mexicans (a good sign) and the kooky, pink-lit bar in the back, blasting the Tejano music had a number of guys sitting at the bar. Their homemade sauces are good, though they give you a runny green concoction they refer to as &quot;guacamole.&quot; Not sure about that. Anyway, we&#039;ll usually sneak back and order a few shots of Cazadores--my fav tequila--from the bartender in the back.

				The avocado sauce you refer to is a traditional mexican sauce for tacos, quesadillas, etc. It&#039;s not meant to be guacamole, for traditional guacamole is too thick to put on tacos, etc. I&#039;m sure if you ordered guacamole and chips you&#039;d get a completely different thing. I guess they just call the sauce &quot;guacamole&quot; so us gringos can understand that it&#039;s made with avocado.

We were spoiled in our old neighborhood in Manhattan where we had our choice of authentic taquerias, all run by Pueblan expats whose avocado-based green sauces (not tomatillo-based) were were much more flavorful and interesting than that Athens Grill&#039;s green goo, which was pretty much just bland, runny guac. And having eaten high and low in Mexico, I doubt it would fly over there.&nbsp; :ticked:
