				There was a thread somewhere mentioning that they had blocked outside seating for construction during summer, which was weird, and then they just closed the whole place for renovations - they&#039;re still not open from my understanding - and after reading the Kafene thread and learning about this Foodista blog, http://www.foodistanyc.com/ (http://www.foodistanyc.com/)<br /><br />I see this: <br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Pasha - 28-27 31st Street, Astoria, NY 11102<br />718.726.0230<br />N/W Train to 30th Avenue<br /><br />On my way home, I spied some good news for Bosnian cevapcici newcomer, Pasha. The place has been open for just a couple of short months and they&#039;re already expanding to a bigger place down the block--<strong>on the corner of 31st and Newton Avenue to be exact</strong>. Business must be booming! According to the sign on their door, continuous patronage has everything to do with it. Here&#039;s what I read:<br /><br />&quot;Thanks to our customers, we will be expanding soon. Come see us in a bigger place with a bigger menu.&quot;<br /><br />It&#039;s nice to see a small business thrive, especially during these not so glorious economic times. Way to go Pasha! We&#039;ll be checking out your new digs soon.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Ok, so like, did Zodiac close up shop and get replaced by this Bosnian place or what?

				They are probably in the place diagonally opposite, formerly Byzantium (?) in one of its incarnations. Odd numbers are on the east side of the street.

				What I heard about Zodiac, which I&#039;ve posted here previously, is that it&#039;s closed because two stories will be added to the building where it is located, which means that additional support columns will need to be constructed inside the existing structure, including the ground floor where Zodiac is, and the basement parking garage.&nbsp; Perhaps something has changed, but from what I had heard, the plan was for Zodiac to reopen when construction on the ground floor was completed.<br /><br />I would take a guess that the Bosnian place will move to the corner where there was a print shop for a long time, and more recently, a convenience store (which never seemed to have much business).&nbsp; The corner opposite from that, where Byzantio was, is now Alma Bank (owned by the same man who owns the building which houses Zodiac), so I doubt that will be going anywhere anytime soon, especially as the bank only opened a few months ago.

There are different herbs as well, and the texture is I guess a bit &quot;spongier&quot;, like sausage--it&#039;s not a loose meat patty.

				Pasha is expanding/moving from midblock on 31st to the Northeast corner of 31st/Newtown which (for a few months) was home to a deli. The Southwest corner was Byzantium is now Alma Bank (why there I&#039;ll never undertand). Hopefully, Zodiac is really going through renovations. I felt, when I saw the closure, that it is going to update so as not to lose business to 30th Ave which seems to have all the chic updates.

				When I walked past Zodiac this morning on my way to the subway, the side door was open b/c workers were hauling out construction garbage-- and from what I saw, the place is completely gutted. So definitely major construction going on.<br /><br />When I moved to Astoria 5 years ago, I used to love going to Zodiac, but somewhere along the line I felt like the quality of the food went down too much so I stopped going. I hope the new incarnation is still somewhat casual/laid back, but we&#039;ll see... I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if they made it more &quot;clubby&quot;, since Life closed (at least I assume they did, because I&#039;ve seen no signs of, um... life there for a while).
