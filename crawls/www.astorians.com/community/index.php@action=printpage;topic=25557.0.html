				Has anyone ever used a local service to pick someone up at the airport for you (or pick you up too). My husband wants to send a service to pick up his sister next week when she flies into JFK since he can&#039;t make it. My only experience is with fancy pants towncar services i used at work and we don&#039;t want to spend 5th avenue kind of money. Would especially love feedback on Ecua or Enrico&#039;s since those are the 2 we use most often. But i&#039;m not married to them.<br />Thanks in advance!

				I&#039;ve used Hoyt for years and their current rate from Ditmars to JFK is $31 before tip.&nbsp; I&#039;d think they will do a pickup as well but might charge a little more if they have to Park.<br /><br />Hope this helps.

				I always go with yellow cabs when coming from the airport. They are cheaper.

				i&#039;d prefer she do like the rest of the world and get a taxi at the airport but my husband insists i arrange for a car to meet her there. In all fairness he had a super bad experience in a yellow cab from jfk years ago. Once the cab left the airport it got off the van wyk and forced him out bc the driver only wanted to go to manhattan. I&#039;m guessing he&#039;s trying to avoid anything like that happening to his sister. he&#039;s always met her at the airport.<br />so anyone ever been picked up?

				<br />When I first visited NYC in the 1990s, my friend arranged a car for me and I really appreciated it because I was pretty clueless on how to get to and around this city. <br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve been picked up at the airport by a car and it&#039;s fine. The driver meets you at baggage claim with a sign with your name on it. Just call the car services you know and see how much it should cost and make the arrangement. I use Hoyt and have had good experiences with them in general. I also like their prices.<br /><br /><br />If the sister is weirded out by taking a single passenger car driven by a stranger, there&#039;s always Super Shuttle. Some people may feel better in numbers.
