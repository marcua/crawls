				Most of my topics don&#39;t excite resposes in double digits and my first poll wasn&#39;t very well thought out so I&#39;m hoping for a home run with this one.<br /><br />My preference is briefs for everyday and boxers for farting (figuratively) around the apt.&nbsp; &nbsp; Tried boxers as an everyday thing and couldn&#39;t get used to what I&#39;ve come to&nbsp; describe as the &quot;flop-factor.&quot;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />Hope that&#39;s not TOO much info for some of you and hope you all have fun with the poll.

				Until I was 32 I wore only tighty-whities because that&#39;s what my mom used to buy for me. In 1996 I bought a pack of boxers on a whim and I&#39;ve never gone back.&nbsp; Boxers are so much more comfortable.&nbsp; I don&#39;t like boxer briefs because of the constricting waistline but of course I had to try them, and in fact I&#39;m wearing them today.&nbsp; Laundry blah blah you know.
