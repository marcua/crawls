				That's a tough question...up until late June of this year I lived on the 31 - 41 side of Ditmars, and now I live on the 21 - 31 side of Ditmars. I think both areas have their benefits - although I did like the amount of stores on my walk from Steinway...seems like the people walking from 21st to 31st don't encounter as much shopping. But still, there are a lot of stores in this area, so that isn't much of an argument...<br /><br />If you include Freeze Peach into the equation (they're on 29th St.) then definitely the 21 - 31 side of Ditmars. ;)

				I live on 38th right off Ditmars, so I think I'm biased. &nbsp;I'm planning on moving soon, though, and I will probably look for a place on the other side. &nbsp;I do like walking past all the shops. &nbsp;718 is a pretty cool place. &nbsp;So is the new Japanese place.

				Jeez do you guys on the 31-41 side have as many NAIL SALONS???? &nbsp;We have two within a five block radius on Ditmars from 29th - 24th. <br /><br />Well you guys have TOP TOMATO...a real bonus!!<br />not too much in the way of buying veggies over here. &nbsp;(I am on 24th &amp; ditmars)<br /><br />I have not gotten to &nbsp;718 yet, how is it???<br /><br />It is a lot quieter here on the west side of 31st. &nbsp;After the cleaners on 24th there is not much else as you head west. If Ditmars was an interstate, Fatty's would be the...&quot;Last rest stop for ____ miles...&quot;<br />ha ha

				Yep, I'd have to agree that as you head towards the Park it gets sleepy, which isn't bad. General shopping and 31-41 has it cold. But the more Bohemian (not the beer gardedn...) places tend to be 31-21. I have walked past 718, it appears to be $ upscale, but nice. $20 Brunches? Is it worth it? Funny, when I moved here 6 yrs ago 'Brunch' was not even spoken here.

				I used to live on the &quot;upper&quot; (31-41) Ditmars area. I do miss the hardware store, the fruit stand, and especially the bagel shop.<br /><br />Now I live on &quot;Lower&quot; Ditmars. I like it here too. Mainly I like being close to the train, and close to Key Food and Commerce Bank.<br /><br />It's hard for me to choose though because I basically live right in the middle of the two ranges (29th St.) I do find myself walking &quot;up&quot; to go somewhere more often than I walk &quot;down&quot; to the park.

				Have you tried out the Freeze Peach? It's located at 29th St. and Ditmars. (just off the corner actually.) It's a cafe, lounge, and internet spot with espresso, coffees, chai, organic teas, and juices.

				I just found the Peach the other day and it certainly ups the value of 'lower' Ditmars. But, being from 35th street, the other side of Ditmars strikes me as a wild, untraveled frontier.
