				woo hoo! so this is the first&nbsp; totally random thread huh? i actually wasn&#39;t sure if this would fall under <strong>Off Topic</strong> or <strong>Random Notes</strong> since i think this does kinda pertain to Astoria.<br /><br />Well anyway, i lurves me some ink! I have been going to the NY Int Tattoo Con every year for the past 8 or so years, and have only allowed myself to get tattoos that one time a year. <em>(i went alittle overboard with silly tats when i turned 18 for awhile and needed to regulate myself)</em>. But anyway-lately i&#39;ve been feeling like branching out and building on my half sleeve. Yeah there are a ton of places in Manhattan, but i thought it would be easier and cooler to establish a relationship with an artist here, that way i could stop in every once in awhile with ideas and we could bounce stuff off each other and build my pieces that way. <br /><br />Did a little research and found 3 local shops, Fat Cat (2810 23rd Ave.), Painless Steel (2315 Steinway) and an unamed one on Ditmars and 38th next door to the sushi place Kumo. Haven&#39;t been to any. Do you know of any others? Has anyone here been? What were your experiences? Can i see your tats for reference? Who&#39;s your fav artists and why? CLEANLINESS?? (yes, that one is uber important) and any other info you&#39;d have i would appreciate.<br /><br />Weird, i didn&#39;t realize there wasn&#39;t a topic on this anywhere on the boards!<br /><br /><em>edited to say that when i started this post, there really was nothing else in here!</em><br /><br />

				I&#39;ve been to Fat Cat for piercing -- and their piercer, Jet, is awesome.&nbsp; Very clean very chill.&nbsp; Browsed the books and checked out the tattoo space which is smallish, but it also looked clean.<br /><br />I&#39;d definitely recommend for piercing and would say it&#39;s worth checking out for tattoos.<br /><br />cheers,<br />jayme<br />

				Is it safe to say that the piercing involves a needle rather than a gun?&nbsp; I much prefer the needle approach (had my 4 ear piercings done that way - soooo much better than a gun).

				Eric and I had our most recent inking done by a woman on Ditmars, but I don&#39;t think her shop is as far as 38th... I think its on the block between 36th and 37th. Its a non-descript little storefront with a blue awning, I think. Next to a bodega. We got them a few months ago. I would never even have seen this particular parlor if it wasn&#39;t for the fact that Eric knew of this woman from a past parlor he was loyal to... My personal opinion was this:<br /><br />well-priced (not expensive, but not so cheap that it makes you wonder what the hell is going on)<br />clean &amp; sterile (new needles, an autoclave that she actually KNEW how to use)<br />no wait, no appt needed<br />specialization in religious ephemera<br /><br />Although I prefer to support female artists, this one was a bit surly in my opinion. She is really no-games about stuff. You&#39;re in and you&#39;re out. No small talk. I am accustomed to dealing with artists (in LA) who will work with you a bit more to develop the image and get a feel for your personality... but honestly, that&#39;s only important if you&#39;ve got some art you need input on. If you&#39;ve got a simple flash or easy iconic design (like we did), she&#39;s great.<br /><br />I&#39;m curious about Fat Cat and the other place!<br /><br /><br />

				if fat cat is still owned by the same folks as when it was on ditmars i would trust them more than the others.<br />i&#39;ve passed painless steel before, and i wasn&#39;t running in there to get my next tat.<br />flooz if you do check out fat cat, let us know. as much as i love sacred, i&#39;m not much often in the mood to trek to canal street. and i&#39;ve been itching to add the &quot;om&quot; to myself.

				thanks annie, thats goooood to know, i don&#39;t like surly people! especially since i design most of my own stuff, i like to have a somewhat cool&#39;ish relationship with my slinger. def good to know about her for flash though. this past may i got work done by my first woman and i really really liked her, she kinda had a better feel (IMO) for the kind of &quot;girly&quot; tat i was looking for. she&#39;s from germany-hence looking for a regular here.<br /><br />-i think this is the same place i said was on 38th and ditmars, i always see a lady in there when i walk by.<br /><br /><br />as for piercings-i&#39;ve had my fair share of that. after trying some random spots, i totally fell in&nbsp; love with the peeps at Venus downtown http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendid=36258498 (http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendid=36258498). the two guys i&#39;ve delt with there were not only super cool, they had the hands of an angel. i have 3 other friends who go there religiously.

				So glad you posted about this flooz, I&#39;ve been researching this for months now (and was actually meaning to ask you about it the other night!). Walked by FatCat the other day and looked in but couldn&#39;t really tell anything. Finally figured out what I want and where, now I have to get my scaredy cat butt out to do it. Promised myself I&#39;d get one when I turned 30 and ... uh ... ahem ... almost 4 years later I&#39;m still inkless.&nbsp; &nbsp;:oops:

				I have gotten my last 4 tattoos from Andrianna, the tattoo artist on Ditmars &nbsp;between 36 and 37th. Out of the 8 tattoos I have, she is my favorite artist. Although she comes off surly if you talk to her she is more than willing to carry on a conversation. During my last tattoo she even asked how my brother and his family were.<br />If you want to check out any of the tattoos she has done come by Hell Gate Social and ask for George. I am planning on going back for my next tattoo as it gets closer to my birthday.<br />Definitely check her out, and her books of her work.<br /><br />George<br />Hell Gate Social

				Ouch!&nbsp; Getting repeatedly stabbed with a needle isn&#39;t my idea of fun.&nbsp; You guys are much braver than I! What happens if you hate the tattoo when it&#39;s done?&nbsp; Or if the guy sneezes while he&#39;s tattooing you and screws it up?

				it really depends on the location and the actual tattoo, the more detailed and complex it is the more fine lining (to me the more painful part) das to be done. and yeah low on your ankle does hurt. i have one there and the other one on the other side is alot higher and was alot less painful. hip, not so bad. arm, not bad at all. neck, uncomfortable-not painful. lower back, ouch. back back, kinda hurt. topof foot, not bad. calf, not bad.&nbsp; left chest, a little (cause it puffed up and had to work alittle harder). outer wrist, nope.<br /><br />but this is just for me, my pain levels may be totally different then yours. <br /><br />i&#39;ll try to find some pics!

				I have little to no computer skills.&nbsp; I would insert pics of my tattoos...however, you can see some on my pics page of myspace:&nbsp; www.myspace.com/leahberman<br /><br />I started getting my ink in my 20&#39;s.&nbsp; I used to be into piercing but went attended some tattoo conventions (to get pierced) .&nbsp; When I went to one convention in Orlando (or somewhere north of S. Florida)&nbsp; to visit a friend who happened to be sharing a booth with an amazing artist, Frank Lee, I finally decided to get my first one -- a snake and dagger on my right upper arm.&nbsp; After that, I got my second (a Coop Devil on my lower back), the day I graduated college.&nbsp; Then I got hired at the tattoo shop Frank Lee was working at in S. Florida and got a free swallow tattoo on my ribcage by Dave Poole.&nbsp; Next, when I moved to Denver, I got a quarter sleeve on my left arm containing all luck symbols (by Brad Lee and Jef Kopp).&nbsp; Then, when I moved to Jersey and hated it and everyone, I got my &quot;Love Thy Neighbor&quot; tattoo on my inner right arm.&nbsp; Lastly, years ago, I got my Oni Mask at the NYC Tattoo Convention by Jef Kopp.&nbsp; Jef got asked to work in Japan after completing it (the artists watched him tattoo me and saw the completed piece).

				I used to really like www.bmezine.com&nbsp; If nothing else they have a ton of images.&nbsp; If you look long enough you might even find my picture or story--did you know your friendly neighborhood artstar used to have her head shaved and her face pierced?&nbsp; It&#39;s a fact!
