				So I heard that Fox &quot;News&quot; yesterday was trying to establish a link between the California wildfires and Al Qaeda.&nbsp; Is this true?&nbsp; Can someone find info on that?&nbsp; If so, are they serious?&nbsp; And I thought I&#039;d heard everything.<br /><br />Don&#039;t drink the water, people!

				In this case, though, I don&#039;t think the ELF needed any help. Bone-dry 80 mph winds and a drought will turn any spark, from a vehicle or a piece of steel hitting a rock, into an inferno in minutes. <br /><br />I also suspect that if global warming makes the drought permanent, the annual fires will be so bad that houses in those canyons will no longer be insurable, and it&#039;ll be a moot point.<br />

				This is from Raw Story http://rawstory.com/news/2007/Fox_hypes_Qaeda_plotted_fires_theory_1025.html (http://rawstory.com/news/2007/Fox_hypes_Qaeda_plotted_fires_theory_1025.html) It&#039;s from a four year old FBI reports that discovered plans to start wildfires in the West.&nbsp; It seems that Fox made it appear that the info was just uncovered.

				Reliable news sources have reported that authorities are looking into the possibility that at least two of the fires may have been caused by arson.&nbsp; I think the Al-Qaeda scenario is ridiculous, though.<br /><br />And a negative nod for Frappe&#039;s obnoxious comment.<br />

				Frappe, nowhere did I tell you you couldn&#039;t have an opinion or express it, just that in my opinion it was an obnoxious comment.&nbsp; I also told you that I gave you a negative nod and why so (because the comment was irksome).&nbsp; I didn&#039;t criticize your person, just your comment.&nbsp; <br /><br />But, I fully admit I have an emotional connection to the situation.&nbsp; I lived in CA for 19 years before I moved to NY.&nbsp; I am very aware of fire season and wildfires, having seen many of them in my time.&nbsp; I&#039;m not going to get into the details, but know I&#039;ve definitely heard both sides of the argument.

				I agree Sweeper. CNN keeps lowering the bar on what professional news reporting and journalism should be. Even Ted Turner, who started the cable network, is upset with what CNN has become. They keep sensationalising their reporting, and it worries me. MSNBC isn&#039;t much better. News channels would mock Fox News, now they&#039;re trying to be just as outrageous as they are.
