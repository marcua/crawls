				I am confused.<br /><br />For a brief while the Blimpies at Crescent and Broadway was open - I ate there and it was delicious as usual.&nbsp; But I couldn&#039;t go there very often and the next time I went, they still had &quot;Blimpies&quot; on the outside, but inside there was no Blimpie board describing the sandwiches and I didn&#039;t see any elongated breads.&nbsp; I saw round rolls and non-Blimpie listings, so I walked back out and never went back.&nbsp; Does anybody know what&#039;s going on?&nbsp; Was it something else with just the Blimpie name?&nbsp; What is it now?<br /><br />The other day I was at Queens Plaza and decided to stop in at the Blimpies there.&nbsp; I&#039;d eaten there once, and it was a regular Blimpies.&nbsp; This time I saw the same round rolls and the same non-Blimpie listings as the place on Broadway.&nbsp; Is the Q Plaza place a Blimpie or not?&nbsp;

				The Blimpies (and Twin Donuts) on Crescent and Broadway are long closed.&nbsp; I believe there was a Carvel there at one point as well.&nbsp; The store closed and opened and then finally closed again for good.&nbsp; It sat vacant for a few months and then the neighboring Trade Fair took it over and added the space to their supermarket.<br /><br />I believe there was also a Blimpies on Steinway, but that closed a long time ago.
