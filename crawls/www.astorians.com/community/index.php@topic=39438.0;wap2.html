			<br />I refuse to accept that in a city of eight million people, there cannot be someone who is looking for a bit of fun. Summer is here and everybody seems to be frisky like agitated dogs in the park. Or at least that&#039;s how I see it. Lol<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;I&#039;m a 39 year old professional man with sense of humor, seeking adventure.&nbsp; &nbsp;:cool: <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Now when I say adventure, I do not mean riding a motorbike across China, which would be far too much of a burden. I&#039;m thinking more local. Queens, Astoria, Long Island City, Roosevelt Island. So if you&#039;re up for a meal, a drink, a meeting up at your place or mine with a bottle of wine, red or white, ladies choice! Then let me know and we can exchange pictures and favorite movies and horoscopes and all that business. But to prove you&#039;ve really read this posting and are not a scammer, in your subject line of your response email please write the words &#039;frisky business&#039;. This shall serve as a sort of secret handshake or nod between you and I, a sign to prove we are both on the same wavelength.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Me: white, male, 39 yrs old, admired by men, desired by women.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;You: ................?&nbsp; &nbsp;(Fill in the blanks)<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;If you&#039;re nice and kind and maybe not a drama psycho person, then I&#039;m sure we will get along.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; :kiss: <br /><br />Get in contact. My email is mp3me@gmx.com and we can exchange photos and all that jazz later.<br /><br />I hope you will read this and respond quickly so we can meet up soon, maybe over the coming long long July 4th weekend.....<br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;
