Or the fact that hospital beds per thousand are one third those in Manhattan. <br /><br />Perhaps we could have them give a pro-development speech on a crowded subway car? <br /><br />As a matter of fact, perhaps this board could get a list of speakers in favor of development and have them go to, well, basically the rest of Queens (which is involved en-mass in frantic down-zoning efforts) and have them tell them the singular pleasures of cramming more people into a community? <br /><br />In the meantime, lets go down to Shore Towers and enjoy the waterfront park space that is open to the public (BTW, does anyone know how to get over that gate?) Later in the day, we can go over to the public gallery in Citicorp Towers (can&#39;t find it? It has to be there somewhere for it was promised when it opened).<br />

				Thanks for the meeting notice.&nbsp; I would love to hear about those concerned with overdevelopment.&nbsp; It seems all we ever hear is about new building and construction.&nbsp; Even in the newspapers all they report on is the wonderful new buildings going up.&nbsp; the newspapers never report on anyone&#39;s concerns about overcrowding schools, increased traffic, and pollution.&nbsp; Doesn&#39;t anyone think that more people mean more cell phone towers and potential helath risks.&nbsp; I for one think this sounds like an important meeting.&nbsp;

				All right, notes from my first LICA meeting.&nbsp; The meetings have been on my calendar for months – I just never got around to going.&nbsp; I always figured someone else would go and care and represent my needs… I’d get there eventually. <br /><br />I guess it was the attack the other night coupled with all this talk about meetings but no one really being able to say what was going on at the meetings.&nbsp; I thought I’d go and be a silent observer.&nbsp; I thought there would be MANY people at a LICA meeting.&nbsp; I thought I wouldn’t even be noticed.&nbsp; I was wrong.&nbsp; <br /><br />Although the mission is on the website – I thought something that Georgina (who seems to be one of the co-anchors of the group) said was interesting.&nbsp; Until a community group (or alliance of groups), that is not tied to any politician, starts to make noise (and maybe a nuisance of itself) and gets it’s message to the media most folk in the community won’t know said groups constituents side of the issues.&nbsp; &nbsp;(This isn’t exactly what she said, but I think I got the gist). <br /><br />LICAllice wants to be an ALLIANCE of organizations in the area that is basically trying to improve the quality of life in the neighborhoods in western queens<br /><br />On to the notes… <br /><br />Many people were at the meeting to talk about down zoning and although it’s an interesting topic – not what I was there for and not what I’m going to write about in detail.&nbsp; If you want more information see me, pm me or go to the next meeting.&nbsp; There was a group of people there who wanted to get help/information in fighting a proposed 6 story development that is in Woodside around 56th st/Boulevard Gardens area.&nbsp; <br /><br />What seemed like good news on the Astoria front: through persistent effort&nbsp; LICA has persuaded P Vallone&nbsp; to a sort of action over the church on 33rd St.&nbsp; (that is slated to be torn down to make way for a 12 story building) There is a “study” scheduled to start in a month or so on downzoning in Astoria.&nbsp; In the meantime the project is on hold.&nbsp; YEAH!!!<br /><br />Before tonight I wasn’t quite sure what downzoning was, I mean I assumed it was what it sounds like, but now I think I have a better grasp.&nbsp; Some info for the rest of you: when the development of western queens was planned in the 60s and the powers that be thought there was going to be a boom (note the Citibank building was supposed to be one of MANY not the ONLY), Astoria was zoned for 4, 6, 8, and 12 story buildings.&nbsp; Welll, the development didn’t happen quite the way it was expected but apparently the zoning was never changed to reflect the growth pattern.&nbsp; So now it’s relatively easy for a developer to come in and build TALL where the neighboring buildings are short – because its zoned that way.&nbsp; Downzoning would change that so an area may be zoned for only 4 stories instead of 12.&nbsp; It also has to do with keeping density level. I’m not an expert yet – but I’m working on it.&nbsp; &nbsp;I know that some folk here are for the development and density growth.&nbsp; In my mind it’s better than sprawl – but only if it’s planned for.&nbsp; Currently Astoria doesn’t have an infrastructure to handle the population that is growing what seems like exponentially.&nbsp; <br /><br />So this downzoning discussion and high density did bring us to the other topics that I wanted to know about namely, crime, garbage and grafitti.&nbsp; It turned out that many other people at the meeting are pretty heated about these topics as well and one very well informed woman told me (and everyone else) that we must go to the Precinct Council Meetings (4th Tuesday of every month, 7pm, Ricardos).&nbsp; Apparently at those meetings you get heard (by whom – I didn’t get the name or position).&nbsp; But she did say to show up in numbers, sit in the front, raise your hand, participate participate participate.&nbsp; Oh and mention what organization you’re with.&nbsp; (Organizations get more notice than individuals).&nbsp; <br /><br />Now I’m going to go off on a tangent a bit.&nbsp; But She kept talking about the Precinct council/civilian Patrol.&nbsp; And this is also linked to the neighborhood grafitti patrol.&nbsp; And she talked about driving around being part of the civilian patrol.&nbsp; And I started fantasizing about the litter patrol… and then she mentioned you can do a “ride-a-long” yes – apparently the Astoria police force will allow you to ride with them on patrol.&nbsp; They give you a bullet proof vest and all.&nbsp; Jonathan – we are SO TOTALLY DOING THIS!!!!<br /><br />Other factoids:<br /><br />April 25th, 2006 the number of officers at the 114th precinct dropped from 300 to 194!!! <br />(Yikes – not really seeming like they’re gearing up for higher density.&nbsp; Or summer in the city.&nbsp; Or World cup action in Astoria.)<br /><br />311 – this number was repeated SO MANY TIMES!! Indeed – we should all use it.&nbsp; Even if they don’t respond to the incident we are calling about – they track the number of calls they get in a particular area, regarding a particular thing and when that number hits a certain “level” they do respond. <br /><br />Get out there and get seen/heard.&nbsp; Volunteer.&nbsp; Astoria needs more involved people.&nbsp; Here we are online – how many now??? Over 800 members – we are huge.&nbsp; We can be loud.&nbsp; Politicians want to appease the masses.&nbsp; We are the masses – but only if we make noise.&nbsp; <br /><br />Vallone – apparently is not a popular man around the LICA.&nbsp; What was interesting was the one person who had a positive incident with the councilman was a man.&nbsp; I noted the fact, but kept my mouth shut – but someone else brought it up and then most people admitted noticing but not wanting to bring it up.&nbsp; So – Vallone is being accused of not responding to women.&nbsp; It would be interesting to hear other comments.&nbsp; <br /><br />The man who got response from Vallone also visited his office in person.&nbsp; The office is on 31st Ave at the end of the N/W line. <br /><br /><br />Grafitti – is Vallone’s pet project.&nbsp; It seems to be the one issue people say he responds to in a big way.&nbsp; There is a new law that says landlords have 30 days to remove grafitti from their buldings.&nbsp; If it’s not cleaned they are fined.&nbsp; Again – get out those phones and start dialing 311 to start the process<br /><br />There was an interesting link made by someone about the recent boom in grafitti that seems tied to nonlocal gangs (L.A., Mexico, etc…) and the growing issue of the warehousing of cheap laborers in illegal apartments…. Overpopulation, grafitti, garbage, crime…. They’re related – if we can make the link… without getting anti-immigrant… He barely wanted to bring it up – because it can easily take on a racist tone – but it’s something to think about.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />Media – it’s all about getting attention so people even know there’s an issue at hand.&nbsp; Everyone wanted to know why they hadn’t heard about the assault on Broadway the other night.&nbsp; Why wasn’t it in the papers?? I didn’t have an answer except that it hadn’t been “filed” as a hate crime – but that was getting changed. <br /><br />Community board #1 – had no vocal fans at the LICA meeting.&nbsp; They were portrayed as difficult and outright RUDE and of course prodevelopment.&nbsp; <br /><br />We have a lot of great writers on this board.&nbsp; And a lot of people who work in media fields.&nbsp; If we want to see changes happen – we need to get word out.&nbsp; We need people to know about our issues. <br /><br />Okay – I think I’ve pretty much covered the main points of the evening.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I missed the meeting yesterday, but that was a brilliant piece of reporting Jennifer. <br /><br />Critical is concepts to develop:<br /><br />1. link between quality of life (dirt, crime, etc) and overdevelopment<br />2. gap between politicans reassuring comments (they have be getting stats that this has been building for months) and reality<br />3. silence on these problems in the press (mindless rehash of politicans press releases masquerading as news).<br /><br />Can someone also post notes about tonight&#39;s ad hoc meeting?<br /><br />

				I am a LICA member and want to thank Jennifer for sharing her notes from our July meeting - and for taking the time to attend the meeting and take the notes. All of your reactions and organizing in response to the hate crime is inspiring and motivating. There cannot be too many activist groups here. If LICA can help in any way by posting your meeting info and concerns on our site, we welcome the opportunity. We are organizing a new section on our site called &quot;Residents Speak Out&quot; and some of the messages posted on Astorians.com are ideal for posting. (The reason we want to post resident&#39;s concerns there is to provide a public showcase that is not always seen in media outside blogs like Astorians.com, including in our local newspapers...which, come to think of it, how many of us read?) If you would like to contribute a posting, please email it to us via the email section of our site at www.licalliance.org.<br /><br />Last, for any newcomers to activism, want to recommend the documentary film: &quot;Howard Zinn: You Can&#39;t be Neutral on a Moving Train.&quot; I just got it from netflix com. Zinn has been at the forefront of progressive activism for decades and it is a real wake-up call that helps explains why community groups independent of political ties are an effective way to affect change in communities. One reason is - politicians don&#39;t want us to. (For example, Bloomberg is said to be stalling on downzoning more parts of Queens, because Queens is slated for the most overbuilding of any NYC borough. A huge number of low-income housing projects are slated for Queens, many in LIC. Can our air quality, streets, hospitals and quality of life support them? Do you hear anyone talking about this outside of astorians.com and LICA?). One reason LIC is an easy target is because it is predominantly rental....and there are no well-established civic groups here, thus no organized group making sure we will still have grass, parks, safety, enough policepeople, schools, etc.<br /><br />I was never an activist before last year, but what I have learned about what LIC faces has made me one. It is also stimulating to meet people in the community and be a part of something that matters.
