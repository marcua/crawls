				I was thinking it would be interesting to categorize ourselves along these lines.&nbsp; Guess I fell like expressing my inner geek.<br /><br />I&#39;d say I am Neutral Good.<br /><br />Checking out the other hot topics around here I&#39;m going to venture some guesses.<br /><br />jcy = Lawful Neutral<br />Schmennifer = Chaotic Good<br />jtrane = Lawful Good<br />megc = True Neutral<br /><br />I am afraid to point out those of evil alignment on the board as evil in that sense is more about the belief in rule of the powerful than evil in the sense that most of us think as being really bad.&nbsp; Too hard to explain so I will go with someone off board as an example.<br /><br />George W.

				I personally am a level 54 Paladin that aligns myself with the Alliance. I destroy all who call themselves the Horde unless they repent of their evil ways and say they are thinking that their destructive history was not worth it and they should have pursued a more peaceful lifestyle.<br /><br />Oh, but you are referring to Astoria.

				merm - I never played D&amp;D so I wasn&#39;t sure what Telesphoros was referring to, exactly.&nbsp; I looked it up on the internets, though, and found this:<br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alignment_(role-playing_games)<br />Alignment (role-playing games)<br /><br />In Dungeons &amp; Dragons and some similar role-playing games, alignment is a categorisation of the moral and ethical perspective of the player characters, non-player characters, monsters, and societies in the game.<br /><br />Not all role-playing games have such a system, and some narrativist role-players consider such a restriction on their characters&#39; outlook on life to be overly restricting. However, some regard a concept of alignment to be essential to role-playing, since they regard role-playing as an exploration of the themes of good and evil.

				I just did the &quot;What D&amp;D Character are you?&quot; (http://neppyman.irulethe.net/dndwho/) test. Here are my results:<br /><br /><b>I Am A:</b> Neutral Good Half-Elf Mage Bard<br /><br /><u>Alignment:</u><br /><b>Neutral Good</b> characters believe in the power of good above all else. They will work to make the world a better place, and will do whatever is necessary to bring that about, whether it goes for or against whatever is considered &#39;normal&#39;.<br /><br /><u>Race:</u><br /><b>Half-Elves</b> are a cross between a human and an elf. They are smaller, like their elven ancestors, but have a much shorter lifespan. They are sometimes looked down upon as half-breeds, but this is rare. They have both the curious drive of humans and the patience of elves.<br /><br /><u>Primary Class:</u><br /><b>Mages</b> harness the magical energies for their own use. Spells, spell books, and long hours in the library are their loves. While often not physically strong, their mental talents can make up for this.<br /><br /><u>Secondary Class:</u><br /><b>Bards</b> are the entertainers. They sing, dance, and play instruments to make other people happy, and, frequently, make money. They also tend to dabble in magic a bit.<br /><br /><u>Deity:</u><br /><b>Mystra</b> is the Neutral Good goddess of magic. She is also known as the Lady of Mysteries. Followers of Mystra wear armor and carry shields with her symbol on them. Mystra&#39;s symbol is a ring of stars.<br /><br />Detailed Results:<br /><br /><table class="bbc_table"><tr><td><strong>Alignment:</strong><br />Lawful Good ----- XXXXXX (6)<br />Neutral Good ---- XXXXXXXXX (9)<br />Chaotic Good ---- XXXXX (5)<br />Lawful Neutral -- X (1)<br />True Neutral ---- X (1)<br />Chaotic Neutral - (-5)<br />Lawful Evil ----- (-1)<br />Neutral Evil ---- (-1)<br />Chaotic Evil ---- (-2)</td><td><strong>Race:</strong><br />Human ---- (-5)<br />Half-Elf - XXXXXXXX (8 )<br />Elf ------ XXXXXXX (7)<br />Halfling - XXXX (4)<br />Dwarf ---- (-4)<br />Half-Orc - (-5)<br />Gnome ---- XXXXX (5)</td><td><strong>Class:</strong><br />Fighter - (-7)<br />Ranger -- (0)<br />Paladin - (-7)<br />Cleric -- XXX (3)<br />Mage ---- XXXXXXXXX (9)<br />Druid --- X (1)<br />Thief --- (-2)<br />Bard ---- XXXXXXX (7)<br />Monk ---- (-2)<br /></td></tr></table>

				Nice.&nbsp; I nailed merm&#39;s alignment (at least according to the online generator).&nbsp; I must say that the generator does seem a little skewed toward good, unless one applies a gaming persona when taking the quiz.<br /><br />I ended up being a Neutral Good Elf Ranger Mage according to said survey.

				I found this terribly amusing.&nbsp; Considering I stink at kareoke, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d make any money being a Bard, but I am an animator for a living so I guess that counts.<br /><br />Chaotic Good Human Bard Ranger<br /><br />Follower Of Finder Wyvernspur<br /><br />Alignment:<br />Chaotic Good characters are independent types with a strong belief in the value of goodness. They have little use for governments and other forces of order, and will generally do their own things, without heed to such groups.<br /><br />Race:<br />Humans are the &#39;average&#39; race. They have the shortest life spans, and because of this, they tend to avoid the racial prejudices that other races are known for. They are also very curious and tend to live &#39;for the moment&#39;.<br /><br />Primary Class:<br />Bards are the entertainers.

They also tend to dabble in magic a bit.<br /><br />Secondary Class:<br />Rangers are the defenders of nature and the elements. They are in tune with the Earth, and work to keep it safe and healthy.<br /><br />Deity:<br />Finder Wyvernspur is the Chaotic Neutral god of the cycle of life and the transformation of art, although he leans heavily towards Good. He is also known as the Nameless Bard. Followers of Finder believe that everything must change in order to grow and thrive. Their preferred weapon is the bastard sword.<br />
