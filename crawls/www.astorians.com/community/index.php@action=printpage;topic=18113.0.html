				I got my eyebrows threaded a few weeks ago and it&#039;s getting time to do it again. The place I went to in Manhattan was $30 - and they said that was a discounted price. Maybe it will be a little cheaper (not to mention closer) at a place in Astoria? Does anyone have any recommendations? Waxing is not an option - it gives me broken capillaries.<br /><br />Thanks!

				I have never paid more than $7 to have my eyebrows threaded.&nbsp; There is a place in Astoria on 23rd Avenue right off 31st street (near the pasta place).&nbsp; I go to a place on 6th Avenue and 23rd Street in the city though.

				There is a threading place that opened up on Broadway between 42nd and 43rd street.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know anything about the place but maybe someone else has some info.

				I can&#039;t recall the name, but there is a place on 30th Avenue, between 37th Street and Steinway. It&#039;s on the Duane Reade<br />Side. It&#039;s an Indian beauty salon and I know I&#039;ve seen a sign that they do threading. I also think Priti has a shop on Steinway and they do threading.<br /><br />But if you&#039;re in the city, the place someone else referred on on 6th &amp; 23rd is good. I work in that area and a few <br />people I know go there.<br /><br />There&#039;s another one on Park Avenue, right next to the 23rd Street stop for the #6 train. It&#039;s next to the Vitamin Shoppe.<br />They&#039;re always busy.<br /><br />I think $30 is high for that. I&#039;m sure you can get it done well at a better price. <br />

				I go to the place in 23rd Ave and 22nd Street; real cheap, really nice.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s like $16 or $18 for chin, lips and brow... I went to a place in the mini mall on Steinway and like 30th Ave ish once too, similar prices just as good.

				In Astoria, I really like Fairy Beauty Salon which is on 30th ave between 31st and 32nd St. I think the salon charges about $ 7 or $ 8 for eye brow threading, don&#039;t quite remember. <br /><br />There is only one girl working there so there can be a bit of a wait at times but the place is very clean and the she is very good at threading. Plus, the place is also open late on weekdays which is also helpful.

				I tried the place on 23rd Ave between 31st &amp; 32nd street since it was closest. They did a good job I thought, though I&#039;m going to take a tylenol before the next time I visit. Ow! (at least the redness lasted only a few minutes)

				There&#039;s a place on 38th street right off of Broadway that does threading for $4.99. My roommate went there and was very happy with it.
