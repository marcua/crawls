			Hi! I just moved to Astoria and I have started a new, free comedy show on Thursday nights at Ravens Head Public House (3804 Broadway). I would love to meet some people in the neighborhood and I hope that this can be a good place for comedy lovers to see some great NYC comics without having to leave the neighborhood. Tonight we have a couple of comics that were on Last Comic Standing and Comedy Central. It starts at 8pm and it is free. Hope to see some people there!<br /><br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br /><br />Erik
