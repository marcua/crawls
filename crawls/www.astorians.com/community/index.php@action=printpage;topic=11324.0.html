				Title: <strong>New Yorker magazine - the Obama cover</strong><br />

				Well, I received my issue of The New Yorker today with the controversial Obama cover. Now, finding the cover humorous or non-humorous is one thing. What I don&#039;t understand is why people are in an uproar because they see this as a terrible attack on Obama and his wife. <br /><br />It reminds me of a Saturday Night Live cartoon by Robert Smigel that aired this past season, which was called The Obama Files. You can see it here: http://hotair.com/archives/2008/03/03/video-the-obama-files/<br />To summarize, it shows Obama on the campaign trail, all the while trying to avoid association with Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson. Now, it was clear to me that this cartoon was saying those two are divisive figures and that Obama would prefer not to be associated with them. I took it as being a positive commentary on Obama and the campaign he&#039;s trying to run. But a lot of people, not so much on that page but in other places, have been upset by the cartoon because they think it&#039;s anti-Obama and racist. I don&#039;t get that at all. It&#039;s not anti-black; it&#039;s anti-Sharpton/Jackson.<br /><br />What do you guys think? Do you find the New Yorker cover and that Obama cartoon to be anti-Obama and/or racist?

				I see Obama&#039;s &quot;indignation&quot; it as a brilliant campaign move.&nbsp; By attacking the New Yorker cover, he widens the base of people who are going to actually read the article itself, which can only help him, since the article itself is generally helpful to his position.&nbsp; Plus he scores some martyr points.&nbsp; I do not believe for a second that Obama truely thinks that the cover is offensive, hes too smart of a guy for that.<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Find big simple bell<br />2.&nbsp; Ring it very loud<br />3.&nbsp; Rinse and repeat.

				The problem with the New Yorker cover isn&#039;t the people who get the satire. The problem is with the people who are uninformed and have been receiving tidbits over the last several months by the right wing propagandists that Obama is:<br /><br />1. A muslim<br />2. Scary<br />3. Has a wife with attitude<br />4. A fist-jabbing terrorist<br /><br />The New Yorker knew this cover will cause alot of sensation and give them alot of free publicity. They also knew what this will compound the stereotypes some people have. I actually have 2 problems with the cover. <br /><br />1. That&#039;s the satirical cartoon is on the cover. It should be inside the magazine like their political cartoons usually are. <br />2. A satire is supposed to an exaggeration or twist on a situation or a characterization that is based in fact. None of the points of the cartoon is based on fact, it is based on the lies that have been perpetuating by the likes of Rush, Faux News, and the other spinmeisters. <br /><br />Those who already are hesitant to consider Obama as a presidential candidate because of baseless rumours will be even less likely to consider him now. I knew within seconds of glancing at the cartoon cover what the effects would be. Looks like I&#039;m already right.

Really? Surely they would&#039;ve already had their minds made up not to vote for him if they&#039;d allow a cover of The New Yorker to reinforce their decision.

				FZ, by informed, I mean people who actually get their news from various sources, and are free thinkers who don&#039;t necessarily buy whatever is spoonfed them. There is too much in the way of half-truths and misinformation that&#039;s taking the place of news today. People tend not to know the real facts on the candidates, and that&#039;s true regardles of political affiliation.

Here, those&nbsp; &nbsp;who&nbsp; &nbsp;don&#039;t vote a&nbsp; certain way, like&nbsp; I do, were called&nbsp; believers&nbsp; in lies and uninformed. Calling&nbsp; that mentality&nbsp; akin to &#039;lemmings&#039; is totally&nbsp; called&nbsp; for and accurate.
