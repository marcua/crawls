				Around 9pm, I saw 33rd Street and 30th Avenue (corner with Key Food and Rite Aid that was crashed into) was taped off, with detectives and a large crowd outside an apartment building near there.&nbsp; I was told it was a domestic dispute turned deadly.&nbsp; Anyone else see this?

				Anyone know what happened on the block of 33rd St. betweeen 30th &amp; 28th Avenues last night?&nbsp; I was walking home around 9:40 p.m. or so and 30th Avenue was blocked by yellow police tape across the 30th Ave. end of 33rd St. preventing any traffic from driving through.&nbsp; &nbsp;There were cop cars there.&nbsp; This morning there was still one of those remote TV trucks.&nbsp; <br /><br />When something happens in Astoria, I usually turn to this chat board for the skinny, but didn&#039;t see any posts?

				Gothamist says there was a homicide on that block last night - apparently a woman was stabbed.&nbsp; Can&#039;t find mention of it anywhere else yet.

				I was told the victim just moved in Astoria a couple of months ago from Florida and also owned a Min Schnauzer dog.&nbsp; Heard also about an abusive boyfriend.

				I&#039;m concerned that this is the answer to my previous post on the endless, blood curdling screaming I&#039;ve been hearing for the past few months in that area.<br /><br />What a terrible thing.<br />
