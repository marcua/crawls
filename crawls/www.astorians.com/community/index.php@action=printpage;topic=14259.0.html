				Hello, it looks like we have another great CSA program in Astoria! I am looking for a vegetable share partner ( to alternate weeks, not rtying to split every single bunch of radishes in half every week). Please check their web site - WWW.HARVESTASTORIA.COM - for the exact prices. If i am not mistaken, it is $300 for 22 weeks of organic vegetables, the admin fee is included, and no volunteering is required (or at least i didn&#039;t find any mention of it anywhere). I am planning to attend the meeting on March 15 at 11 at the Church of the Redeemer. Please email me at eviaffa@yahoo.com if interested.<br /><br />I will also consider splitting a fruit share and perhaps a dozen eggs on occasion.<br /><br />Thanks!

				Hi elenacoln,<br /><br />Thanks for setting this up for us... you beat us to it :)&nbsp; We do expect there to be a good turn-out this Sunday, so I think people who are looking to split shares will have a good chance of getting paired up.&nbsp; That said, it is good to have a share partner in mind before you come, if possible! <br /><br />We are not officially organizing partners, but we are trying to direct people to each other when we can and will try to facilitate pairing this sunday!<br /><br />Just a few clarifications (we apologize - our website is packed full w/info right now, but this information is on there):<br /><br />- Our single share price is $330 (admin fee included).&nbsp; <br />- We have a required &quot;time donation&quot; of one shift during the season.&nbsp; The core is entirely volunteer-run and we can&#039;t function without all our members helping to contribute during distribution days.&nbsp; When you sign up for Harvest Astoria, you also schedule in a time to help us out!!<br /><br />Let us know if you have any more questions!<br /><br />-Harvest Astoria Core<br /><br />
