				From the village voice......<br /><br />Wondering what&#039;s your favorite one?<br /><br />this is mine.....I know exactly where to stand at both Steinway and 30th Ave stations. When going to work, Central Park, UES......<br /><br />In fact, I&#039;m so good, I have a halfway spot on the 34 St/Herald Square station so that if an R shows up, I can get the front car for the Steinway station or the 4th car for the 30th Ave station. <br /><br />7. Subway &quot;prewalking,&quot; in which you walk to the exact right spot on the platform to board the train car that will save you the most time upon exit, exists and has a name. Gotta respect.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Here are 50 other reasons to be blissfully happy that you live in New York City today -- and every day -- that you live here. May it be a very long time. Unless you want to leave, in which case, get the f___ out, and can we have your apartment?<br /><br />50. Sending your laundry out for someone else to wash and dry it is not only convenient, it&#039;s just good business. Especially since you will probably never own a washer and dryer. Which means you never have to feel guilty about not doing your own laundry. Next.<br /><br />49. Drinking coffee four times a day, every day, isn&#039;t the exception, it&#039;s the rule.<br /><br />48. The secret Chick Fil-A at the NYU dining hall.<br /><br />47. There is always someone crazier than you. ALWAYS.<br /><br />46. The view from the Brooklyn Bridge.<br /><br />45. The view of the Brooklyn Bridge.<br /><br />44. The epic feeling you get running to catch a train and succeeding...just before the doors close.<br /><br />43. Bored to Death. 30 Rock. SNL. And a million other things that film here and we love. RIP Law and Order.<br /><br />42. Manhattan-Brooklyn/Brooklyn-Manhattan wars never cease to entertain. Nor do hipster-Hasid wars. Or hipsters in general.<br /><br />41. We get the inside jokes. Because, actually, we made them up in the first place.<br /><br />40. That horrified look on our parents&#039; friends&#039; faces when we tell them we live in &quot;Hell&#039;s Kitchen.&quot;<br /><br />39. Sure, we work out next to Alec Baldwin, Padma Lakshmi, and Bridget Moynahan, and walk the streets with Willem Dafoe, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Tina Fey, but, really, we&#039;re kinda too busy with our own lives to notice.<br /><br />38. Drinking is like breathing. Or slightly more acceptable.<br /><br />37. Because it&#039;s not enough to just love New York. New York needs to love you back, too. Hey, we have high standards.<br /><br />36. Whatever you need, whenever you need it, there is someone who will bring it to you for a price, which may or may not be negotiable. (Or legal.)<br /><br />35. By the time the rest of the nation has bedbugs, we&#039;ll have figured out how to get rid of them. In the meantime, we&#039;ll mock them by dressing our dogs up as bedbugs for Halloween. Laugh in the face of fear, New Yorker!<br /><br />34. There are almost 200 bars in the East Village alone.<br /><br />33. There&#039;s no shortage of stupid rich people to make fun of.<br /><br />32. The endless delights of the New York Post.<br /><br />31. You don&#039;t even need a passport, or a license, to partake in goat-eyeball tacos.<br /><br />30. The fact that one-bedroom apartments cost an average minimum of a half-million dollars means we think nothing of spending $12 on lunch.<br /><br />29. Restaurants are as common as single men and women. And equally diverse. And you never have to see either of them again after the initial awkward encounter.<br /><br />28. The omnipresent opportunity to Gaga-ify yourself. And the chance that it will seem, just, normal.<br /><br />27. Runnin&#039; Scared lives here! (And so does the Village Voice.)<br /><br />26. Smart people are the norm, not the exception. (Which doesn&#039;t mean they&#039;re sane, but at least no one&#039;s boring.)<br /><br />25. Except in select &#039;hoods like Park Slope and perhaps the Upper West Side, children are viewed as mysterious beings, rarely sighted and only occasionally understood, like pixies or magical small butlers. Until they scream, in which case, they are banished from the palace.<br /><br /><br />24. When you fly back into the city after a vacation or business trip, no matter how long you&#039;ve lived here, you get that butterflies-in-the-stomach feeling.<br /><br />23. Efficiency in a drugstore checkout line.<br /><br />22. How easy it is to find doughnuts, pizza, Chinese food, or any other snack your drunken self desires at 4 a.m. Or to continue to drink. Responsibly!<br /><br />21. Broadway. Museums. CULTCH-AH. Even if you never actually go to see anything (though you should, at least once).<br /><br />20. Yelling f___&quot; is just a mild obscenity.<br /><br />19. There&#039;s no shame in sticking your fingers in your ears like an anal weirdo when an ambulance goes by screeching.<br /><br />18. Summer concerts at the Williamsburg Waterfront.<br /><br />17. So many Missed Connections, so little time.<br /><br />16. Other places have dog and cat people. We have ferret people.<br /><br />15. The splendor of the Union Square Greenmarket.<br /><br />14. A bagel with cream cheese and lox from Russ and Daughters.<br /><br />13. There is an insane Korean day spa (Spa Castle) waiting for you in Flushing. And Russian and Turkish baths in the East Village.<br /><br />12. One of our bars has 100-year-old urinals.<br /><br />11. Complain about the MTA, but you can get anywhere in the city for just $2.25. Or $2.50 single ride, come 2011. Still pretty damn cheap.<br /><br />10. Subway rage. Bike-lane rage. Walking rage. Random rage. These are our therapy. Although we all go to therapy, too. No judgments! We bitch, therefore we are.<br /><br />9. Jaywalking is an art form.<br /><br />8. The free Ikea ferry to Red Hook on weekends! Plus, Red Hook in general. Can you say &quot;Lobster pound&quot;?<br /><br />7. Subway &quot;prewalking,&quot; in which you walk to the exact right spot on the platform to board the train car that will save you the most time upon exit, exists and has a name. Gotta respect.<br /><br />6. You can be alone, but never feel lonely. And vice versa. But if you die and aren&#039;t found until a year later, you won&#039;t be the first.<br /><br />5. We are, as a group, anti-fanny-pack as much as we are pro-gay-marriage. Hetero marriage, on the other hand, we can pretty much take or leave.<br /><br />4. 35 is the new 26. Or is it 45? Whatever, age ain&#039;t nuthin&#039; but a number, and as long as you&#039;re younger than your IQ score, no harm, no foul.<br /><br />3. Finding your &quot;local&quot; is that much better here.<br /><br />2. There is absolutely no reason to ever drink and drive. Added bonus: Spontaneous, fascinating conversations with cab drivers.<br /><br />1. If you can make it here, you really can make it anywhere. But why would you bother to go anywhere else?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Here&#039;s the link....<br />http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2010/11/50_reasons_to_b.php (http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2010/11/50_reasons_to_b.php)<br />

				I love that I taught myself to prewalk before I knew it was A Thing.<br /><br />That said, my prewalk in the morning puts me in the subway car next to the ideal prewalk car because that car gets super crowded due to the prewalking and I like to breathe. Is there a word for that? (Oh yes, it&#039;s called overthinking. Whatever, I have my space.)

				i can hear the transplants now, &quot;ohmygod-ohmygod-ohmygod, i know of some of these things, i&#039;m like, such a new yorker!&quot;.&nbsp; the truth is, natives don&#039;t get giddy and make a list of these things, we barely notice it because its just accepted as the way it is.&nbsp; i highly doubt any native thought &quot;this list is soooooooo new york.&quot;&nbsp; its just life in the big city, these things are the norm.&nbsp; a natives list would have been just 50 things to bitch about.&nbsp; i couldn&#039;t make it past the few because they were so silly sounding...

				It&#039;s a humorous list but really, living in New York (well, Queens) is not that much different than living in any ohter major metro area for MOST folks. I mean, unless you&#039;re really into the opera or Broadway plays, for instance, life is pretty much the same here as in Chicago or the San Fran Bay area. I&#039;ve lived in both places (and now here) and in each place I paid too much rent, commuted by subway and/or El, walked most places, eaten many types of ethnic foods, shopped at a variety of ethnic groceries, and had friends from all over the world. I like living here but it&#039;s certainly not the be-all and end-all for me.

				Don&#039;t know if this made the list or not, but I&#039;m pretty damn euphoric today because NYC is such a hub, everything usually passes through here.&nbsp; <br /><br />Today, Mike Holmes is doing a magazine promo tour at the Borders Book Store on Wall Street.&nbsp; &nbsp; Since his show is based in Canada, it&#039;s not likely I&#039;d get the chance to meet him unless I lived in NYC.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />For all of you going, &quot;Who the hell is Mike Holmes?&quot;...<br /><br />http://www.hgtv.com/holmes-on-homes/show/index.html<br /><br /><br /><br />...and for the record, I&#039;d rather be living upstate or someplace quieter.<br /><br />
