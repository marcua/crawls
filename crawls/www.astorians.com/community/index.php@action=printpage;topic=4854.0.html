				I am vacating my apartment at the end of February and my landlord wants me to leave my keys with the super so they can show the apartment. I know this is normal practice but a.) i dont have a spare key to give the super, b.) i dont want to leave my only key with the super and have to track him down everytime i get home so i can get in to my apartment and c.) i hate the fact that a couple of strangers are going to be walking around my apartment (realtor and future tenant) when i am not there. <br /><br />thoughts? experiences? thanks :|

				I&#39;d suggest a couple of things -<br /><br />If you are entirely uncomfortable with having strangers in your house while you are absent (I would be too probably), then just tell your landlord that your apartment will only be available for viewing during the hours that you are home.<br /><br />If you can&#39;t show people yourself, then go get a key made. It&#39;s cheap, fast, and would save you a bit of hassle.<br /><br />I personally haven&#39;t experienced this, but those would be my thoughts...

				IANAL, but I don&#39;t believe that under NY law you have to give consent for a property manager to show the apartment. I think the property manager/super only has a right to enter over your objections in the case of urgent maintenance problems (plumbing leak, etc.) I think you can refuse permission, but expect more trouble getting your deposit back...!<br /><br />This said, it&#39;s not a big deal. The realtor&#39;s not gonna steal your CDs. Just make sure they give you 24 hours notice before showing so you can pick your drug paraphernalia off the floor. It costs a buck or two to duplicate most keys, it&#39;s legal to do so, and it&#39;s certainly worth having a spare or two anyway... (The super doesn&#39;t have a key?? What&#39;s up with that?)<br /><br />(On preview -- I agree with W&#39;sam&#39;s suggestions too!)

				Having people in *my* home looking through *my* closets and cabinets would make me puke. I don&#39;t know if there are any laws that cover this type of situation, but frankly, if it were up to me, I&#39;d refuse the key until I am out of there. What is the landlord gonna doâ€”evict you? You&#39;ll be long gone before he can draw up those papers.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=4854.msg49750.html#msg49750">Quote from: Harlan on January 24, 2007, 01:51:24 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">(On preview -- I agree with W&#39;sam&#39;s suggestions too!)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Okay.

				well i was thinking to get a key made so i dont have to be bothered with getting it back from the super but its the whole strangers in my apartment when im not there thing - i feel like i have to hide sensitive things (like bills, checkbook..ps3!). then again, why the hell should i get it made.<br /><br />in general, its a drag. i dont have a problem with people looking at the apt while i am there, so i guess i could tell them when im am usually around or something like that. i just want to make sure i get my deposit back. <br /><br />thanks for the quick responses!

In midwestern college towns, almost all rents turn over on the same day (August 15th), and people frequently sign leases six months before moving in. In that situation, property managers have to have access to the property to show it, and in fact the standard leases (at least in Champaign-Urbana, IL) say that they have the right to do so with 24 hours notice. I don&#39;t think such a clause would be legal in NYC&#39;s very tenant-friendly legal structure... <br /><br />

We walked in and the whole place was just a disaster - clothes and trash on the floor, old food sitting out, dirty dishes, beer bottles. It might have been a decent place if it had been clean. But then again, if they had cleaned it beforehand we might have wound up in a place infested with roaches and rats because of their amazing wealth of laziness and lack of self-control. <br /><br />The place we wound up taking still had someone living there, but he was in the process of moving out, so the place looked fine when we looked at it. AND - we stole nothing! :)
