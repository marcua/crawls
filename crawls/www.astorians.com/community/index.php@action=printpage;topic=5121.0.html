				That totally sucked.&nbsp; Packed shuttle N, and then packed 7 platform.&nbsp; I ended up going downstairs at QBP, letting several trains go by, and finally squeezing onto a packed E.&nbsp; Suck-o-rama.&nbsp; Oddly enough, though, I&#39;m only about 10 minutes late.

				I just got to work and I was at the Ditmars station at 7:45 a.m. today.&nbsp; <br /><br />HORRIBLE does not even come close to the experience this morning.<br /><br />Fortunately I got a seat but as the train filled up I had this woman with a HUGE PURSE AND A BACK PACK, her back pack slammed into my face one time...she didn&#39;t even realize it and I didn&#39;t say anything because the train was full and it was an accident but she was on her cell phone swaying back and forth not caring who was around her, hitting everyone with either her bag or back pack.<br /><br />I finally pulled on her back pack and said LADY IF YOU HIT ME ONE MORE DAMN TIME WITH THE BACK PACK I&#39;M THROWING IT OUT THE DOOR AT THE NEXT STOP....... :x<br /><br />ARGH...if you&#39;re carrying that much you&#39;re suppose to (I reiterate) suppose to be concious of the fact that you may hit someone with the extra bulk especially on a crowded train.<br /><br />I wanted to beat her up...ARGH&nbsp; :x

				When I got to 36 Ave the attendant was trying to tell people &#39;no trains, don&#39;t go up&#39;.&nbsp; People were screaming at him to make an announcement and he was trying to explain that he couldn&#39;t - I felt kind of bad for him.<br /><br />I was about to hike over to 36th St and try to catch another line when I heard a train come.&nbsp; So I ran (not the best idea given my still-recovering foot), but it was packed.&nbsp; I figured, trains are running, apparently, so I&#39;ll wait it out?<br /><br />Another train came through 20 minutes later and skipped us, then another one came that stopped but was packed.&nbsp; I finally just got into work.<br /><br />&nbsp;:killme:

				Got to the R Steinway St stop at about 8:50 this morning. After watching 4 - 5 packed R and V trains stop and open the doors so about 3 people could squeeze in, I finally got on a fairly comfortable R train. When I finally snagged a seat at 5th Ave, some lady decided to sit next to me and eat a smelly bagel and lox sandwich. WTF? <br /><br />Anyway, I&#39;m just got into work about 10 minutes ago...an hour late. I&#39;m really tired of this crap. And even though I know I can contact the MTA for a letter stating there were train problems, I know my boss is getting tired of me getting in late at least 2 times a week because of our sorry excuse for a transportation system.<br /><br /><br />/rant<br />:x

				Yeah.&nbsp; It was ridiculous today.&nbsp; And to make things worse...<br />When they said the trains weren&#39;t going to Manhattan (I was at Ditmars), I walked down to Hoyt hoping to take the M60.&nbsp; After waiting over a half hour freezing my ass off, no bus.&nbsp; WTF?!?!?!&nbsp; So I walk back to Ditmars, get on a train and run into Lanseaux.&nbsp; We were on the first train to go into Manhattan after the problem.&nbsp; The MTA can kiss my ass.&nbsp; I haven&#39;t had a smooth ride to work in almost 3 weeks.&nbsp; It&#39;s either door problems (most frequent and more often than ever lately), sick pasangers, or track issues.&nbsp; They really need to get their s___ together because this is just getting to be ridiculous.

				I get on at Ditmars and transfer at QBP to the 7 one stop for work in LIC. It&#39;s a decent commute but today HOLY COW. I wasn&#39;t even all that far away from the doors when we rolled up to QBP so I thought it would suck but I would still make it off okay. With all the pushing and the crowds jamming on without a second to let people off, I had to start yelling so people would stop pushing me back on the train. A definite battle for close to 2-3 minutes. But I made it through. Otherwise I would have ended up in Manhattan and really p.o.&#39;ed. Madness.

				what a ridiculous morning. it was funny seeing the mass exodus of people walking out of the broadway station this morning.<br /><br />i walked up to steinway and grabbed a V train with no problems, aside from the fact that the train stayed in each station in queens for a good 5-10 minutes just sitting there. luckily i got into work only 5 minutes late.<br /><br />this isn&#39;t as bad as living off of the R though, when I did in my old apartment, trying to get a train anywhere on the weekend was a fiasco bc of all the perpetual work they did on the line.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-P

				I guess I was lucky in that I had no problems catching a train at Broadway at 7:40.&nbsp; We did sit for a long while between stations from Lexington Ave. to 34th Street.&nbsp; At that time, there were no Queens-bound trains running; things must have gotten screwed up with Manhattan-bound trains soon after.&nbsp; I hope that by 8:30 or so tonight, when I&#39;ll be coming home, this&#39;ll all be fixed!

Fleuranges, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said some trains had been re-routed to avoid the damaged track as a safety precaution, resulting in delays throughout much of the subway system.<br /><br />He said repairs would be made during the day and that the system should be functioning normally by the evening rush hour.<br />

				I left the apartment earlier than usual and headed for the Bway station. Ran into my roommate who told me about the situation and we headed for the steinway station. <br /><br />There was a V waiting when I got there but it was so crowded that I waited for the next train. The first V sat in the station for a long time. Caught the next one. Hard not to sneeze on people when the trains are so crowded. Delays at every station and problems with the doors.

				I heard about it this morning right when I got up, so I left for work early as I had an important meeting this morning.&nbsp; There was a lot of dithering at the Ditmars station about trains/buses, saw some people trying to work out a deal with a couple of gypsy cabs.&nbsp; Just as I was about to head for the Q19A stop (along with the rest of humanity), a train pulled in.&nbsp; Ran up the steps and got on, figuring it would leave eventually.&nbsp; I did move to another car at one point, and that&#39;s when I ran into Jtrane.<br /><br />It did leave, but not before a long delay, during which they told us repeatedly that they were going to wait until it was as full as possible.&nbsp; Right -- that would be helpful to everyone else at the other stops.&nbsp; Sure enough, once we hit Broadway, they announced we were skipping 36th Ave. and 39th Ave., presumably because the train was too full.&nbsp; (Our car wasn&#39;t even jam-packed -- there was definitely room in the middle.&nbsp; I felt like the people getting on at 30th Ave. and Broadway didn&#39;t realise there was room beyond the crowd of people at the door, like they were subway newbies or something, because some people were just staying on the platform.)<br /><br />Then, without fanfare, at QBP, the conductor simply said that the next stop was Lex.&nbsp; Ok . . .?&nbsp; I made it to 5th Ave. (my regular stop), and walked into my office at 9:32, only two minutes late.&nbsp; Odd.

				It&#39;s kinda cool how you can just stand in the middle of the train, hold onto nothing, and when the train tips from side to side, or slams on the breaks, the mass of people kinda just stays connected and noone falls.&nbsp; I know this sounds weird, but......the train was SO packed this morning..........I almost thought it was kind of fun.&nbsp; Where else in the world do you get THAT close to so many people......for 40 minutes of your day?&nbsp; It&#39;s a humbling experience.&nbsp; At least it was the MTAs fault that I was so late.......better than me dragging my ass out of bed 45 minutes too late.&nbsp; Sure would have been nice for them to announce the service changes on the platform today(hardly anyone at Astoria Blvd. knew what was going on......unless they went down and specifically asked the guy at the booth).

				I don&#39;t think they have any means of announcing on platforms (except maybe at Ditmars???).&nbsp; Has anyone ever heard a platform announcement at Astoria Blvd, 30th Ave, Broadway, or 36th Ave?&nbsp; The booth attendant at 36th Ave yesterday was trying to explain that he just didn&#39;t have the means.<br /><br />And as for staying upright on the train...

				There are no loud speakers between Astoria Blvd and 39th Ave Stations. Never heard an annoncement in my life on any of those platforms. <br /><br />It was important I be in at work on time by 9:00am Thursday for a meeting ,so I left home 7:50 to leave plenty of time for delays. After waiting almost 30 mins, I went down to ask the token booth clerk at 30th Ave what was wrong, a crownd had already gathered. She wasn&#39;t very articulate, but the trains weren&#39;t running, she didn&#39;t seem to know what to say to the passengers who needed directions. I knew there were only 2 obvious options; take the bus to Queensborough Plaza for an the 7 train, or walk to the Steinway Str Station for the R train (a 3rd option was to go home). I ended up walking from 30th Ave Station to the Steinway Station. Needless to say I was late for work and the meeting, arriving at 9:25am, getting dirty looks from management.<br /><br />Friday morning there were more problems, no trains at all for over 20 mins, then several Ditmars bound trains start showing up back to back. The first train that arrived bypassed 30th Ave as usual, and the next train packed like sardines. I was late again today, third time this week. Once again they gave no reason for delays. Very frustrating to work in midtown and not be able to make it to work in under an hour.<br />

				the past few days during morning rush, theres been serious problems on the N/W. I had to switch to the 7 at QBP and had to do the old &#39;head down and bowl people over&#39; just to exit the train. These people who transfer from the 7 there are the worst. They let about 2 people off the train before they decide to bumrush a PACKED train in some effort to find a SEAT!! It&#39;s unreal. <br />Us N/W riders are far more considerate than that!!!
