				So, I&#039;ve been to the big three now...<br /><br />Totonno&#039;s<br />Lombardi&#039;s<br />Grimaldi&#039;s<br /><br />Haven&#039;t been to Patsy&#039;s up in Harlem yet, but don&#039;t know if it&#039;s worth it as it&#039;s really not the same as the original, or so I&#039;ve heard.<br /><br />So after finally finishing the big 3 by going to Grimaldi&#039;s last night, the winner is.....<br /><br /><strong>Totonno&#039;s</strong>&nbsp; :lol: :lol: :lol:<br /><br />The crust is really what separates it from the other 2.&nbsp; The other two are fabulous, and the difference between all 3 is relatively minimal.&nbsp; But the crust at Totonno&#039;s is really something to behold.<br /><br />The key to the best pizza, IMHO, is the brick oven.&nbsp; Ingredients obviously are super important, but the oven, specifically brick oven, is what gives the crust the wonderful charred bottom and smokie flavor.&nbsp; Arrrggghhghghg.&nbsp; I&#039;m beginning to drool again thinking about it.<br /><br />Also, if you get to Grimaldi&#039;s before 6:30, you&#039;ll get a table right away.&nbsp; We did last night.&nbsp; Got a seat as soon as we arrived.&nbsp; We left around 7:30ish, and the line to get in was down the block!!!!&nbsp; They forgot to bring a beer we ordered, and the service was a little rushed and oblivious.&nbsp; But they are so busy, I&#039;ll let it slide.&nbsp; And the pizza is so good, it&#039;s worth it.

				Totonno&#039;s is good, but I prefer Grimaldi&#039;s right now.&nbsp; Hoping to get back to Coney Island this summer and try it again for a reevaluation.&nbsp; But Jtrane is right, both are terrific.&nbsp; :-) Not a big fan of Lombardis, though.<br /><br />

				Something&#039;s fishy about $1,000 New York pizza<br /><br />Thu Mar 15, 12:05 AM ET<br /><br />NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York restaurateur has cooked up the world&#039;s most extravagant pizza -- a $1,000 pie topped with six kinds of caviar and fresh lobster.<br />ADVERTISEMENT<br /><br />Nino Selimaj, who runs six pizza restaurants in the Big Apple, on Wednesday unveiled the Luxury Pizza, a 12-inch (30-cm), thin crust topped with caviar, lobster, creme fraiche and chives. Cut into eight, it works out at $125 a slice.<br /><br />&quot;I know this won&#039;t be for everyone but there are people in New York who can afford it and once tried, they&#039;ll be back for more. It is delicious,&quot; said Selimaj, who moved to New York from Albania about 29 years ago.<br /><br />&quot;Sure, some people will say it is just a publicity stunt but I have researched this for over a year and think there is a demand. I have already sold one,&quot; he told Reuters.<br /><br />Selimaj said Nino&#039;s Bellissima in Manhattan, the only one of his restaurants to offer the dish, needs 24 hours notice for the gourmet dish because it orders the caviar in advance.<br /><br />&quot;But where better to experiment with pizza than in New York where people love their pizza?&quot; he asked.<br /><br />If diners are still hungry after the Luxury Pizza, they can always head over to nearby restaurant Serendipity, which sells a $1,000 ice-cream sundae called Golden Opulence that is covered in 23-karat edible gold leaf.

				Thanks JTrane!&nbsp; And I agree with you completely!!&nbsp; I still miss paying $1.25 for a slice anywhere.

				Well, I&#039;m taking credit for positive nodding Daisy, who was simply reporting the news, and negative nodding Jtrane for not understanding that you don&#039;t shoot the messenger!

				I should clarify that I went to the Coney Island location of Totonno&#039;s, the Brooklyn location of Grimaldi&#039;s, and the Little Italy locatioin of Lombardi&#039;s.

				I recommend Di Fara&#039;s. I&#039;ve never had Totonno&#039;s, but I think Di Fara&#039;s is much better (...much better...) than Grimaldi&#039;s and Lombardi&#039;s, as well as John&#039;s and Patsy&#039;s.<br /><br />There are two downsides to Di Fara&#039;s. First, it&#039;s way down in Brooklyn at the Avenue J stop on the Q. Second, there is always a long wait. If you go, be sure to call at least 45 minutes in advance and put in your order.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
