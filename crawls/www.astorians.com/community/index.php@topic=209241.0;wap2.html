			Hello, I&#039;m hoping to buy an apartment in Astoria and, as this website will shut down at the end of the month, what other forums are available to learn about what it&#039;s like to live in various units and whether the landlords are responsive and that kind of thing?&nbsp; I&#039;m new to the area and would appreciate any help.&nbsp; Thank you.

			I bet you could ask the folks in the Astoria subreddit. Last I checked - and it was a while ago - they were rather salty but they might have some good ideas. Good luck!
