				Does anyone have a good cab service # <br /><br />I used New Enricos 718-728-5599 but after today I don&#039;t want to use them again.<br /><br />This morning I called and scheduled a cab for pick up at 8am, I know they are usually busy and backed up cause of the snow and everyone wants a cab so I figured if I called at 7:30 for 8am it would give them more then enough time and they shouldn&#039;t be late like they usually are.<br />The lady said no problem they will be there, 8 am came and no cab so I called them she said 5 min I waited for 5 min called back again and she said oh the cab is on ditmars at the Taxi Service office I have to send you another cab she keeps saying 5-7min as time went by I didn&#039;t get a cab till 8:25. <br /><br />So if anyone uses any good reliable cabs please let me know thanks&nbsp; :-)

				Well, I&#039;ll put in another plug for Hoyt. I&#039;ve used them a long time and they&#039;re always prompt, clean, courteous, and reasonably priced (we&#039;re in the Ditmars area, so they&#039;re close by).<br /><br />The guy who drove me today actually had a Prius, which was novel -- he told me that many of the drivers own their own cars, which I didn&#039;t realize. And that the Prius saves him $40 A DAY in gas. Those Continentals guzzle $50/day worth, which was pretty astounding to me.<br /><br />So if you&#039;re looking for a hybrid car service, call Hoyt &amp; see if Felix is around :)

				I love Ecua, and I use them just about every day to take my kid to school during the winter. However, the last week or so I usually get massive busy signals in the morn and they don&#039;t take reservations. Yesterday someone finally picked up and hung up seconds later.&nbsp; I love Ecua but for now doing Acropolis in the morning and Ecua at night since the phone actually rings.&nbsp; I heartily endorse Ecua just like all their other fans but Rane raised a good point I think.

				I used Olympic for awhile many years back but got tired of the dirty stinky cars.&nbsp; Then I switched to Hoyt, which initially was better, but then wound up the same:&nbsp; dirty and stinky.&nbsp; Plus, for awhile a few years back I was taking a car into the city for work every day because I couldn&#039;t walk (on crutches) - I would have appreciated a little consideration from them considering I was giving them about $150 a week.&nbsp; I would have been happy with an acknowledgement that I was a regular client.<br /><br />So I switched back to Olympic - which is better now.&nbsp; I&#039;ve used New Enrico&#039;s a few times but find it hit or miss on the quality of the interiors.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had really nice and I&#039;ve had really ghetto.<br /><br />I&#039;ll have to try Ecua next time ...

				Another vote for Hoyt. I don&#039;t use a car service often, but when I have (and have had to send visitors home in a car), I&#039;ve always used them. Always a couple minutes early, good prices, and good service.

				So todays was my first time taking a cab since my New Enricos experience. I first called Hoyt but their line was busy so I called Olympic and they came within 10 min just like they said. But when I went to pay I handed him $20 cause it was the only bills I had on me and he yelled at me for being the 3rd customer he had this morning that game $20 bill and what was he going to do for change for later on ?!?!<br />I was in shock.. I don&#039;t think I will be calling them again...I will try Equa and Hoyt<br /><br />&nbsp;:|

				I recommend Hoyt. As a biker, 9 out of 10 times I see a livery car doing some stupid and dangerous move (cutting me off, U-turn in a busy intersection, running red lights, etc), it turns out to be Ecua.

				I&#039;m going to give a nod to Olympic, after my latest experience. I returned home from Florida last week (Tuesday @ 10pm), I normally just have a carry-on and can shoot to the taxi line and not wait too long. But this time I had my golf clubs so I needed to wait. Naturally, they were among the last bags to come out. I checked the taxi line and no chance I was waiting (about 3 flts came in at the same time). I went UPSTAIRS to the departing flights level and called Olympic to see if the had a car in the airport or nearby. (I had used them to get there the week before) Originally, the dispatcher said &quot;about 40 minutes&quot;. Whoa- I told him I just came upstairs to avoid the line and figured it would be easier find me. &quot;Hold on a second, let me check on something&quot;- He came back on and said car would be there in 5 minutes. Sure enough, car came and I was home in 5 minutes. Turned out the driver had just finished fixing a flat and was just outside the airport when he got the call.<br /><br />So I appreciate that and basically gave away a little trick to avoid the confusion at the pickup areas. Especially later in the evening when there are few departures from LGA.
