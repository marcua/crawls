				Help! I have to buy a shortwave radio as a gift and I don&#39;t know anything about them. I did a bit of research on-line but I am still a bit confused. Does anyone have any info on them. So far the two electronic stores I have gone to the sales help have been less than helpful. Any info or advice would be much appreciated!!

				wow! I thought I was the only person on earth who still felt the need for a short wave radio!<br /><br />I guess the question is, how sophisticated a radio do you need to get? (Or how far out of range will the person you are buying it for be. I have done fine with my tiny Grundig with the analog tuner, but a digital tuner is always a good thing to have. Other than that, I am usually a fan of smaller over larger, esp if your friend is travelling a lot.<br /><br />

				It&#39;s good to have a short wave radio when you are hanging out in a tent in the middle of nowhere... a little BBC and VOA is never a bad thing<br /><br />(Why VOA you ask... it kept me up to date on the NBA finals, sad, I know :) )

I am looking for a mid priced radio. What I am confused about is the short wave bands. For example does 8 shortwave bands mean that it can only pick up 8 stations (sorry if this is a really stupid question but I have no idea!!??)<br />

				no, each band is about the equivalent of what we have on AM or FM, and covers a certain transmission range. You should find out what frequency the things he wants to listen to are on and how strong the signals are. I know the BBC recently stopped shortwave transmissions in the US, not sure about other channels.
