				Yesterday I passed by the old Jimmy&#039;s Puerto Rican Restaurant and saw signs that there will be an Indian Restaurant opening in that location.&nbsp; I&#039;m very excited about this.&nbsp; We don&#039;t have any Indian restaurants in this area.&nbsp; The sign said there will be a buffet too

				They took the paper off the windows and it looks very nice inside.&nbsp; They hung up these beautiful lamps that are very colorful.&nbsp; There is a sign with the name. I don&#039;t remember it but think it starts with a Y.&nbsp; I can&#039;t wait for this place to open.&nbsp; I will definitely be going there

				I was off from work yesterday and thought that I might like to try the new restaurant.&nbsp; I went there and didn&#039;t see any customers so I felt funny walking in.&nbsp; Also most of the things on the menu cost $11.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think they have a lunch menu yet.&nbsp; I hope that they will soon be having a buffet.&nbsp; That&#039;s what I&#039;m interested in.&nbsp; They need to do something to attract customers.&nbsp; Maybe they should hand out menus on the street

				<br />The name of this place is Yaar. I&#039;m hoping they have some lunch specials, too. Would be great if they offered a thali or some sort of combination special at dinner. They do seem to be trying to break out of the mold for North Indian restaurants in the U.S.<br /><br /><br />I hadn&#039;t seen this article about it until searching just now - interesting: http://astoriapost.com/seva-owners-to-open-new-byob-indian-restaurant/<br /><span style="font-family: verdana;" class="bbc_font"><span style="font-size: 2px;" class="bbc_size">http://astoriapost.com/seva-owners-to-open-new-byob-indian-restaurant/ (http://astoriapost.com/seva-owners-to-open-new-byob-indian-restaurant/)</span></span>

				Last night, my wife and I went to Yaar, and we were thrilled.&nbsp; The inside has several beautiful mosaic hanging ceiling lamps.&nbsp; The staff is super friendly and attentive.&nbsp; And the food was really good.&nbsp; No beer nor wine yet, so BYOB if you wish to drink.&nbsp; And yes, when they hear an N or Q train pull into the station, the rush out with a tray of samples.&nbsp; Smart stuff.&nbsp; &nbsp;I hope that these guys do well.<br />(http://postimg.org/image/5jy06qykh/)<br />(http://postimg.org/image/5jy06qykh/)

				In terms of lack of customers, it was fairly filled after 8:00 pm last night, including several Indian people enjoying the food.&nbsp; It looks like Yaar does a decent amount of takeout as well.

				I&#039;m glad to hear that they were busy.&nbsp; I would hate for them to have the same fate as Jimmy&#039;s Puerto Rican Restaurant. I looked in there around 5PM when I got off the train.&nbsp; I guess people go out to eat later than that

				Picked up order from there last night.&nbsp; DELICIOUS.&nbsp; I think it will be a huge success and seems to be a big hit already!&nbsp; I love that it&#039;s BYOB too.&nbsp; Something was fishy with Jimmy&#039;s from the start.&nbsp; I think this will be solid and will be there a long time.<br />

				&nbsp;I decided to try Yaar on Saturday.&nbsp; I went there around 3 and loved it as soon as I walked in. The atmosphere in there is so relaxing.&nbsp; The beautiful stained glass lanterns that they have hanging are all different with different designs and colors.&nbsp; I also loved the soft Indian music that was playing.&nbsp; They made me feel welcome from the minute I walked in telling me to sit up front by the window. I ordered the Chicken Kofta and it was delicious.&nbsp; I told some friends about and we&#039;re going back there next Sunday.&nbsp; I think this restaurant will be a huge success.&nbsp; I also asked if they will have a buffet and they told me they are working on it.

				We did take-out last Friday and it was wonderful, definitely up to the standards that we were accustomed to at Seva (except that Seva wouldn&#039;t deliver to us, so it had to be a once-in-awhile treat). I was sad to see that my favorite malai kofta isn&#039;t on the menu, but on the recommendation of the host there I got the butternut squash kofta and it was just as good. I&#039;m thrilled that we&#039;ve got a dependable Indian place so close by, and I agree, I&#039;m sure they&#039;re going to be a success.

				Every time I walk by there are no customers inside at all.&nbsp; They also have a sign up cash only.&nbsp; That could also discourage people from eating there.&nbsp; Oh well. I liked the food.&nbsp; I just hope that business picks up for them and hopefully they will take credit cards in the future and have a buffet

				The food is really tasty and solid. I&#039;ll be back for the food but I hope they improve the space. It can be quite loud and there is nothing on the blank white walls. Basically there is zero ambiance. It also feels very narrow in there, especially compared to how Ditmars Station&#039;s setup was (booths). For now I&#039;ll do takeout only (cash only doesn&#039;t bother me at all).

				The food is fantastic!&nbsp; Like, possibly the best Indian food I&#039;ve ever had.<br /><br />I agree with you on the ambiance.&nbsp; They desperately need something on the walls - I&#039;m thinking a lot of colorful lights, portraits of Ganesha, Hanuman and Vishnu would spice things up- All of the decor we&#039;ve come to expect and love about Indian restaurants should be represented.&nbsp; They had some modern Indian music playing also and I&#039;d like to hear more.<br /><br />Overall, this place rocks and I&#039;m so happy great Indian food came to the Ditmars area.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=38811.msg254098.html#msg254098">Quote from: megc on October 26, 2015, 10:01:37 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The food is really tasty and solid.

				My wife and I went Saturday night.&nbsp; It was probably around 7-8.&nbsp; Place was pretty empty, but it was pretty cold out.&nbsp; Food and service were excellent.&nbsp; I think the bus staff must challenge each other to see who can refill the water glasses the most.<br /><br /><br />They threw in a free appetizer and a sample of their rice pudding for dessert.&nbsp; All in all it was definitely on point and worth the trip.&nbsp; Especially so if you live near enough that Seva was always &quot;too far away.&quot;<br /><br /><br />They do need to do something to the space though.&nbsp; They have the beginnings of some decorations, like hanging lamps and a mural on the back wall.&nbsp; But there is a lot of empty white space throughout that needs some dressing up.

				Great lunch buffet. Extremely friendly service - so much so it could be toned down. I was eating alone and felt I was being hovered over and watched but I guess that is far superior to being ignored. I will definitely be back.
