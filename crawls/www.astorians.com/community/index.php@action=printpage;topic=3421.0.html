				Try Himalaya Teahouse on 31st Avenue between 33/34th Sts.&nbsp; Lovely atmosphere with wide selection of great teas (beer &amp; wine too) and the food is nothing short of awesome.

				The problem with Himalaya is, though it may see itself as a &quot;linger-here-and-read&quot; type of teahouse, it&#39;s laid out like a restaurant and projects the atmosphere of a restaurant.

				The thing with the Himalayan Tea house is I&#39;ve never seen a lot of people in there...I&#39;m usually the only one often, so I never feel like someone is waiting for the table, so big or not, it is really nice and the people are friendly...almost happy to have the customers..they have awesome teas and love their soups..

				If you&#39;re willing to consider a pizzeria, try Grand Ave. at 30th Ave. and 35th St.&nbsp; Well-lighted, musicless, and they let you sit as long as you like as long as the place isn&#39;t crowded.&nbsp; I often bring a book when I go there.&nbsp;
