				Must have been sometime in the last month.&nbsp; &nbsp;I like the food although it was pricey for my budget.&nbsp; I suspect that being slightly off the beaten track and the competition from Bare Burger must have done them in.&nbsp; Plus, I think that the market might be over saturated for that kind of food.

				I never went there.&nbsp; Where was it located?&nbsp; I can&#039;t believe they charge extra for pickles and mayonnaise.&nbsp; No wonder they went out of business.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t pay extra for that

				Is this the place that was over by JJ&#039;s on 31st Ave? I never went for two reasons. Within 4 or 5 blocks you had bareburger and sweet afton, which is pretty stiff competition. That&#039;s not to mention the smattering of other burger joints that have popped up in the last few years. At this point there&#039;s an overabundance of burger places, and I can&#039;t imagine demand holding up.

				Speaking of nearby burger shops (to the one that closed) has anyone tried the Tasty Burger Shack on Steinway near 30th?&nbsp; It looks good.

				Well it is halal, and organic, it was very dimly lit the first time, the second time I was in the front in the daytime and did not notice it.&nbsp; The food was tasty and nicely presented and for me at least, served as a nice laxative.&nbsp; I am not going back.&nbsp; YMMV

				We ordered in from Burger Bistro once -- it was awful. When burger is in the name of your restaurant, you should at least be able to cook a decent one.<br /><br /><br /><br />
