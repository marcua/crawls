				After watching a cooking show today, it got me thinking about the use of frozen vegetables in certain dishes, something that I really only associate with my childhood in the Upper Midwest.&nbsp; Do any of you use frozen vegetables?&nbsp; And if you do, for what purpose(s)?&nbsp; Do you think at times there is an advantage to using frozen over fresh?

				frozen veggies do have their uses.<br /><br />I am certain that the crepe dish at beer garden uses frozen spinach and its a great dish.<br /><br />For catering we use frozen spinach for creamed spinach and with pasta dishes.&nbsp; using fresh costs way too much and 4lbs of fresh spinach sautees down to about 4cups.<br /><br />Frozen peas a great year round. never use canned. try a fresh pea soup with frozen peas and you will be pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />frozen rasberries, strawberries and blueberries are excellent products.&nbsp; Jaque Pepin suggests using them for baked desserts and fruit sauces.<br /><br />Just be sure to by the best brand possible. cheap frozen spinach might have some sand in it.<br /><br />whats a bad brand?&nbsp; any generic or cheap supermarket house brand.&nbsp; <br /><br />Birds eye, bjs and costo house brands are best.

				I&#39;ve also had good luck with some other frozen vegetables in stews, where they&#39;re going to be overcooked anyway. Corn and okra, which are quite seasonal and freeze/thaw well come to mind. I&#39;ve got a really good recipe for a quasi-West African stew with peanuts and okra... Also, frozen pearl onions work OK too. (Although, for the fantastic coq au vermouth I made last night, I used fresh pearl onions. The recipe suggested cutting an X at the root end and boiling for 3 minutes to loosen the skins. Worked pretty well...)<br /><br />And no comment on frozen tater tots.&nbsp; :-o<br />

				I&#39;ve got frozen berries and bananas in the freezer for smoothies.<br /><br />Frozen spinach for baked spinach dishes.<br /><br />Frozen corn/peas for miscellaneous &quot;throw ins&quot; where they&#39;re good in something (black bean + corn salad) but you don&#39;t need a whole lot.<br /><br />Also edamame.<br /><br />And sometimes I&#39;ll blanch and freeze leftover CSA veggies.&nbsp; Green beans mostly.<br /><br />I&#39;ll also freeze baggies of canned beans (garbanzo, black beans, kidney beans, etc) when I don&#39;t need the whole can in a recipe.<br /><br />cheers,<br />jayme

				does frozen tater tots count as a veggie or a premade food item? either way they are right up there with gordons fish sticks!&nbsp; <br /><br />And Meg, you are better of with frozen veggies in the winter than store bought fresh produce that will most likely be in sorry shape.<br />Examples: corn, okra, pea, sting beans, etc...

				I always keep a box of birds eye brand sweet corn in my freezer because its great in soups and for homemade creamed corn... the chopped spinach is a staple for quiches! Frozen lima beans are great for fast succotash (but I prefer edamame for SOYcotash)&nbsp; :wink: I never get any veggies canned because I feel like they taste funny and metallic.

				Can I just say, you all are awesome!&nbsp; Thanks for the great tips and advice.&nbsp; I expect to be adding a few things from the frozen section to my grocery basket.&nbsp; I actually once bought frozen shittake mushrooms, but that&#39;s about the extent of it.&nbsp; And I especially like the idea of freezing any leftovers from my CSA share.<br /><br />I admit I like fish sticks and tater tots.&nbsp; Hadn&#39;t thought of the tt as a frozen veggie though.&nbsp; &nbsp;:lol:<br />

				Usually for stir-fry. I am not a big fan of frozen vegetables because they don&#39;t taste the same as fresh, but when you&#39;re making stir-fry it can get expensive to use just fresh, so frozen is a good supplement.

				I really, really like TJ&#39;s frozen green beans.&nbsp; They are excellent - and leave me with no prep work, to boot, which I appreciate when I&#39;m getting home at 8pm and preparing dinner.&nbsp; I nuke them, covered, with no added water for four minutes, and then saute them with slivered garlic in olive oil for two or three minutes.&nbsp; Toss in a little red pepper flakes and/or a little grated parmesan for a great dish.<br /><br />During the winter, we occasionally buy frozen broccoli and cauliflower.&nbsp; Surprisingly enough, the Key Food brand of both contains more florets and fewer stem pieces than the name brands - can&#39;t remember whether it was Green Giant or Bird&#39;s Eye.&nbsp; But I bought them side by side and poured them into bowls to compare.<br /><br />TJ&#39;s mushroom blend is also very good, and cost-effective, although you have to be patient and careful because frozen mushrooms exude even more water than their fresh counterparts.&nbsp; And TJ&#39;s frozen shelled edamame!&nbsp; Other brands of edamame are good, too.<br /><br />Frozen spinach is probably the most frequent visitor to our freezer, though.&nbsp; I have to say I&#39;ve never had any problems with Key Food brand, although when I can afford it I buy organic.&nbsp; We also buy frozen berries - that&#39;s what I make my blackberry/raspberry, sage and caramelised shallot reduction with.<br /><br />I can&#39;t remember the last time I used a canned vegetable, except for tomatoes and hearts of palm.&nbsp; I didn&#39;t grow up with canned vegetables, so it&#39;s not something I think of.

If I do the CSA this summer though, I&#39;m going to need someone to give me a primer in freezing veggies. I&#39;ll probably have more than I can use and like the idea of having some fresh summer produce in the dead of winter!

				Frozen vegetables are said to be more nutritious than the fresh produce you get at the market. That&#39;s b/c freezing is done not long after the vegetables have been picked, and therefore more vitamins are retained. <br /><br />&quot;Fresh,&quot; OTOH, has been sitting around after being trucked in and gassed with ethylene or whatever it is they do to force ripening/maintain color etc.<br /><br />Besides, you think they use fresh produce at fancy restaurants? Edamame is a GREAT frozen food to have on hand- toss in soup or quickly boiled and eaten like popcorn. I&#39;m also partial to other small and cut-up frozen vegetables that can be added to many things. <br /><br />Oh yeah, bananas can be frozen for a while rather than left to turn black and then tossed out. Great for smoothies.

				HOGWASH!&nbsp; (where did that term come from anyway?)<br /><br />Where as there might be some kernals of truth in there about being fresh frozen,&nbsp; Fresh foods are always best. Of course with the exceptions of bad produce off season.&nbsp; That is the reason for canning, preserving and freezing in the first place.<br /><br />And of course fresh local produce is best.&nbsp; For so many reasons one would think an explanation would not be needed here.&nbsp; <br /><br />There is just no way that any upscale restaurant will be using frozen veggies over fresh.&nbsp; Edamame maybe an exception, but really couldnt say for sure as I am not an upscale Japanese restaurant.&nbsp; But the edamame is not the shining example for the whole industry.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Sit outside any restaurant one morning and watch the produce trucks pull up with lots of fresh items.&nbsp; There will be a chef there picking over everything to be sure that only the freshest and best make it into the kitchen.<br /><br />Now, all that being said, I refer you to my original post about how good frozen foods can be.&nbsp; There is a time and place for them just not everywhere.<br /><br /><br />

				Of course FRESH fresh veggies are ideal; what I meant was, by the time they make it from fresh-picked to Top Tomato or Tavernaki Whatever, they&#39;ve been sitting on a truck for a couple of days already.<br /><br />Frozen vegetables are frozen right after picking, which makes me think they&#39;re better than &quot;fresh&quot; but not better than fresh-picked. <br /><br />In any case, once you cook anything the vitamins are eliminated that way too, so it&#39;s all moot I suppose :p ;)
