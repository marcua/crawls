				We enjoyed a good meal there recently.&nbsp; Had a small pizza as a starter and it was pretty good, especially for coming out of a brand new oven.&nbsp; for entree I had arugula salad with steak and have to say i was surprised at how good the steak was.&nbsp; Dressing pairing was bad so got that on the side and replaced with balsamic &amp; olive oil.&nbsp; My husband raved about his alfredo pasta dish with chicken (and he hates chicken!).&nbsp; they do have gluten free pasta and whole wheat too, but it&#039;s not marked on menu.&nbsp; The &#039;hostess&#039; in platform heels that teetered us to our table was a bit strange and out of place, but otherwise positive experience.&nbsp;

				<br />We tried them for the first time last weekend.&nbsp; Had an AMAZING pizza!&nbsp; I highly recommend them.&nbsp; I&#039;m interested in trying their other stuff, too.&nbsp; I like that they offer family style platters.<br /><br /><br />I agree about the hostess - it&#039;s odd.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=23222.msg225618.html#msg225618">Quote from: LHT on August 17, 2012, 12:20:16 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The &#039;hostess&#039; in platform heels that teetered us to our table was a bit strange and out of place, but otherwise positive experience. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Thought it was weird that the place means Antique in Greek, but it is Italian food.&nbsp; Guess they are just Italian Greek fusion, sort of like the neighborhood.&nbsp; Haven&#039;t tried it yet, but I will.
