				I think there&#039;s a squirrel in my apartment&#160; :-o<br /><br />A few weeks ago, my husband and I were woken up by a squirrel who had latched himself onto our bedroom window screen and was furiously clawing away. Thankfully, we scared him off in time, had a funny story to tell, and thought nothing of it.<br /><br />But this morning that same window screen has a different hole in the corner and had been completely torn away from the frame. Hardly a screen anymore, more like a convenient door flap. Also, there are three very suspicious looking yellow-ish puddles on the window sill. Oh no. Not a funny story anymore.<br /><br />We loudly wandered around the apartment with broomsticks trying to scare him out of any corner he could have been hiding in, but no luck. We&#039;re currently comforting ourselves with the thought that he came in, saw no food, peed and left. But I don&#039;t know. <br /><br />Mice, roaches and water bugs suck, but come with the territory. But squirrels in an NYC apartment? This must be out of the ordinary. Anyone else ever deal with this? Anyone have one of those handy humane squirrel traps I could borrow for a few days?<br /><br />(Ironically, this is not the first time (http://&quot;http://corgankel.diaryland.com/loud.html&quot;) something like this has happened to me. Though it&#039;s the first time they&#039;ve ever physically made it inside. For whatever reason, NY squirrels really want to be my best friend.)<br /><br />

				It used to happen quite often with me, they would come up the fire escape and try to claw their way through the screen, what kept them from coming in was the cat.&nbsp; He would always stand guard at the window and eventually the squirrels stopped coming.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think they&#039;ve become accustomed to being fed, I&#039;ve seen people leave nuts and things out for them on the fire escape and this is a big NO NO.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never done that because I know better but a lot of people think they&#039;re cute and will leave them food.&nbsp; <br /><br />You can go to Home Depot and get one of those high ultra sound devices that plug into the socket, those do work not only against mice but squirrels too, you may want to try that since you&#039;re having this kind a problem.&nbsp; Good thing is that it will start getting chilly soon and the windows will have to be closed anyways but for the meantime you may want to do this to break the habit of them coming to your window and trashing your screen.<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng1N2vM3Fh0<br />

				Thanks Liz. That is exactly what happened, he was on the window by the fire escape. We do have a mouse problem too (I&#039;ve been routinely catching them in humane traps.) I think those high ultra sound devices are in order.<br /><br />That video is proof that these guys get their mind set on getting in, and they don&#039;t give up. ACK!

				Ok, my husband has been awake in the house for a bit now, and there doesn&#039;t seem to be any unwanted guests lurking. I think we dodged a bullet here. Gosh I hope so.

				You should still get that sound device for the mice, it&#039;ll keep the mice away and if Mr. Squirrel decides to come back...it&#039;ll keep him away too!&nbsp;

				Or you can make yourself a squirrel catapult. Looks real simple. And efficient. Heh, heh.<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtBVG09b-i0&amp;feature=related<br />

				OMG!! I&#039;m one of those humane mouse catchers... but that squirrel was outta here! I&#039;m sure I&#039;d be fantasizing about that if I found him in my kitchen...
