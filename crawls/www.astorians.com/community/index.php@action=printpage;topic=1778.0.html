				huh ... <br /><br />Welcome to the Netherlands! But first, a test of tolerance<br />Thursday, March 16, 2006<br />BY BRUCE MUTSVAIRO<br /><br />Associated Press<br />AMSTERDAM, Netherlands -- The camera focuses on two gay men kissing in a park. Later, a topless woman emerges from the sea and walks onto a crowded beach. For would-be immigrants to the Netherlands, this film is a test of their readiness to participate in the liberal Dutch culture.<br /><br />If they can&#39;t stomach it, no need to apply.<br /><br />Despite whether they find the film offensive, applicants must buy a copy and watch it if they hope to pass the Netherlands&#39; new entrance examination.<br /><br />The test -- the first of its kind in the world -- became compulsory yesterday, and was made available at 138 Dutch embassies.<br /><br />Taking the exam costs $420. The price for a preparation package that includes the film, a CD-ROM and a picture album of famous Dutch people is $75.<br /><br />&quot;As of today, immigrants wishing to settle in the Netherlands for, in particular, the purposes of marrying or forming a relationship will be required to take the civic integration examination abroad,&quot; the Immigration Ministry said in a statement.<br /><br />The test is part of a broader crackdown on immigration that has been gathering momentum in the Netherlands since 2001.<br /><br />Anti-immigration sentiment peaked with filmmaker Theo van Gogh&#39;s murder by a Dutch national of Moroccan descent in November 2004.<br /><br />Both praise and scorn have been poured on Immigration Minister Rita Verdonk, the architect of the new test and other policies that have reduced immigration by at least a third.<br /><br />&quot;If you pass, you&#39;re more than welcome,&quot; Verdonk said. &quot;It is in the interest of Dutch society and those concerned.&quot;<br /><br />Not everyone is happy with the new test.<br /><br />&quot;Today is a black day for the people intending to bring their partners to Holland,&quot; said Buitenlandse Partner, a lobbying group for mixed Dutch/immigrant couples.<br /><br />Dutch theologian Karel Steenbrink criticized the 105-minute movie, saying it would be offensive to some Muslims.<br /><br />&quot;It is not a prudent way of welcoming people to the Netherlands,&quot; said Steenbrink, a professor at the University of Utrecht. &quot;Minister Verdonk has radical ideas.&quot;<br /><br />But Mohammed Sini, chairman of national Muslim organization Islam and Citizenship, defended the film, saying homosexuality is &quot;a reality.&quot;<br /><br />Sini urged all immigrants &quot;to embrace modernity.&quot;<br /><br />A censored version with no homosexual and nude material had been prepared because it is illegal to show such images in Iran and some other countries, filmmaker Walter Goverde said.<br /><br />&quot;With all the respect I have for all religions, I think people need to understand that Holland has its own liberal side as well,&quot; he said.<br /><br />After viewing the film, which is available in most languages, applicants are then quizzed on important Dutch facts such as the number of provinces that make up the Netherlands, the role played by William of Orange in the country&#39;s history and Queen Beatrix&#39;s monarchical functions.<br /><br />There are some major exemptions. European Union nationals, asylum-seekers and skilled workers who earn more than $54,000 per year will not be required to take the 30-minute computerized exam. Citizens of the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Japan and Switzerland are also exempt.<br /><br />http://www.nj.com/search/index.ssf?/base/news-5/1142488697167360.xml?starledger?ntop&amp;coll=1&amp;thispage=1

				Good for the ever-pragmatic Dutch. I think this is a fantastic idea.<br /><br />Would never fly here, though. Too much opportunity to politicize it. If the fundies don&#39;t kill it in the name of antiquated Victorian-era mores, the idea would get PCed to death before it even left the drawing board. The very notion that *gasp!* we set out to tell immigrants what they can expect to find in our culture -- even aspects that they may *gasp, again!* find offensive -- is anathema to the liberal establishment. Mustn&#39;t offend, even if telling the truth.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Dutch theologian Karel Steenbrink criticized the 105-minute movie, saying it would be offensive to some Muslims.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well I say tough sh*t. Move somewhere else. Let those who don&#39;t object to the existence of multicultural, secular and open societies immigrate to countries like Holland. That vicious, cruel Islamofascist who murdered Theo Van Gogh had no business in a place like Holland.<br /><br />Aside from EU nationals (as per the Schengen Agreement on the free movement of EU citizens) I don&#39;t see why the other exemptions should be justified, though.<br /><br />But <strong>duluoz cats</strong> your assumption that this reveals some sort of &quot;naked racism&quot; is clearly an exaggeration:<br /><br />- Japanese are also excluded<br />- Asylum-seekers are more likely to come from non-European, non-North American countries<br />- Russians, Ukrainians, Bulgarians, Croats, Serbs, Belarusians, Bulgarians, Romanians, Moldovans, Macedonians, Icelanders, Norwegians, Liechtensteiners, while whites, are citizens of non-EU members, and thus NOT excluded

				Fascism is a great idea ... my fascism.  :evil:<br /><br />I don&#39;t think &quot;naked racism&quot; is an exaggeration, perhaps a dramatic turn of phrase. They&#39;re clearly going for a <em>specific</em> group here. The fact that the Japanese and Americans are excluded makes that point ... I&#39;m pretty sure we have a few different racial groups in this country, and more than enough idiots at each end of the social ladder (and if Holland wants them, please, be my guest ...). My point about the exemptions was not just about being white ... If you&#39;re going to do something like this effectively, and under the guise of a tolerant society, there can&#39;t be <em>any</em> exemptions, even EU nationals, Agreement or not (I hear the Germans and the French have a couple of hang-ups ... though, frankly, I&#39;d like to hear who doesn&#39;t. Myself included ...). That&#39;s the beauty of intolerance, it covers all.<br /><br />Of course I agree that there is no place in the world for Islamo-fascists, but neither is there for any other kind, and that&#39;s what this policy is all about.<br /><br />“Dissension, diversity, the grain of salt and mustard are needed: Fascism does not want them, forbids them ... it wants everybody to be the same.... But immaculate virtue does not exist either, or if it exists it is detestable.” --Primo Levi

				My intitial impression was that the exempt countries are some of the wealthiest and the citizens would be more apt to bring money into the country.&nbsp; I know when you apply as a student to the Royal Conservatory at den Haag, you must prove that you have $$ in the bank before even being considered.&nbsp; So yeah, I think it&#39;s more an economic issue than blatant racism (although the two are intertwined, no lie).
