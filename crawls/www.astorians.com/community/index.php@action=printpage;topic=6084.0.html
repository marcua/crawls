				My husband and I were&nbsp; walking down Steinway Street between B&#039;way and 34th Avenue and we saw something that really annoyed us.&nbsp; I can&#039;t remember the name of the restaurant.&nbsp; I&#039;m talking about the place that burnt down and reopened (the one with all the weird manikins).&nbsp; Anyway, there was a manikin on the street outside the place and a shower head over it.&nbsp; Basically, it was a weird display of this manikin taking a shower (fully clothed).&nbsp; The water wasn&#039;t going into a drain and being resused.&nbsp; The street was getting drenched.&nbsp; What a waste of water any day, but they&#039;re doing it on Earth Day too.&nbsp; I think that&#039;s ironic.&nbsp; I am disgusted.&nbsp; I walked by an hour later the water was still going.&nbsp; The manikin was getting water logged.&nbsp; It&#039;s just so odd.&nbsp; I said something to an employee I saw walk out about wasting water and earth day (even though I don&#039;t think they should do something so wasteful any day).&nbsp; She just ignored me.&nbsp; I just think the whole thing is really odd.&nbsp; It really annoyed us.&nbsp; I have never ate there, and now I never will.&nbsp;

				That&#039;s ridiculous. Along similar lines, I get pissed off at places that leave the doors open on hot summer days while the air conditioner is going full blast. I think the city&#039;s trying to ban that. Also, the Sprint store on 31st and Ditmars annoys me every day by having a dude stand out front handing out flyers that end up all over the ground, but now they&#039;re annoying me further by having what&#039;s essentially a giant windsock out on the sidewalk, except it&#039;s a huge vertical yellow dude with a very loud, powerful fan blowing air up the bottom. It&#039;s a useless waste of electricity and stupidly loud too. I would never claim to be the most energy efficient person on the planet, but these things are kind of egregious.

				I didn&#039;t see this but it does sound terribly wasteful. I like the vision of it and the idea of the advertising/art, but it should be recycled water in a contained structure. Just having it spill onto the sidewalk sounds not only wasteful, but weirdly antagonistic too. Not exactly respectful to the neighborhood. I&#039;d be surprised if this lasted.

				You should call the Councilmembers for the area, Vallone, Jr. and Gioia and see if anything can be done about it.
