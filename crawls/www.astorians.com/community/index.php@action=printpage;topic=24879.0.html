				Hey Astorians,<br /><span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">My boyfriend and I are relocating to NYC from the South at the end of May.&nbsp; We are moving because he has been offered a job in City Planning.&nbsp; His office is in Queens, and I will most likely find work in Manhattan, so we feel like Astoria is a good fit for us.&nbsp; </span><br /><span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">We are looking for a room in an existing situation if possible, for less than 900 a month, moving in June 1st.&nbsp; We are also open to teaming up with other roommates to find an ideal apartment.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">We are both nice, clean, easygoing, normal young professionals who are financially stable and able to prove it.&nbsp; We are in our mid-twenties, we enjoy going out but also staying home and cooking some nights.&nbsp; Please message me if you are interested in speaking with us more, if you have a room available or know someone with a room available!&nbsp; Any advice would also be appreciated :)</span><br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />Sylvia<br /><br />

				<br />Hi!<br /><br /><br />I have a room in Astoria (31-65 23rd street) for $750 starting from June 1. It&#039;s really a good sized room- I have a queen bed, a dresser a desk and electric piano and I still have room to do yoga in here. The commute to Midtown is 25 mins door to door, and all the conveniences that you could want are close by: there is a laundromat, Rite Aid, Associated grocery store and Post Office literally across the street. There are many shops and restaurants along Broadway. It&#039;s really quite lovely! You would be living with two males in their mid 20&#039;s.<br /><br /><br />Please get in touch if you&#039;re interested!<br /><br /><br />Julie
