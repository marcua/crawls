				here&#039;s what I said on Craigslist<br /><br />OPEN HOUSE WEDNESDAY, MARCH 28 6:30-8 <br />Please email so we have an idea of how many people to expect! <br />ditmars_room@yahoo.com <br /><br /><br />One small but comfortable room available in big, beautiful, clean 3 bedroom at the corner of 35th and Ditmars in beautiful Astoria. You will be sharing the apartment with 2 friendly and busy females in their early 30&#039;s. I have been living here for the last 3 years and am (amicably) moving out to get my own place down the street! <br /><br />The Ditmars area of Astoria is super safe, clean, and friendly. There are two big grocery stores within a 2-3 minute walk and a 24 hour vegetable stand across the street. The Ditmars stop is just down the street, and since it is the last stop on the train you will almost always have a seat. 20-25 minutes to midtown. Gyms, banks, bakeries, and all kinds of delicious treats abound. <br /><br />Our apartment is in a duplex with our young and friendly landlords living downstairs. Although it is not an official part of our lease, if you are nice, you are likely to find yourself barbecuing with them in the backyard in the warmer months. They have a big goofy dog named Duncan. We have a small, slightly crazy cat named Cat. Although he is generally an okay guy, I don&#039;t think Cat would let us have any more pets. <br /><br />The apartment itself is in good shape, with shiny hardwood floors and stone tiles. We have an extremely cool kitchen with a pass through window to the living toom. Lots and lots of light. The room is somewhat small (8.5 / 11), I can easily fit a trunk, a queen-sized bed, a bookshelf, a regular dresser, and a sock/undies dresser in there. It is on the corner of the building and there are 2 windows so there is a lovely cross-breeze in the summer months. We are looking for a friendly female in her late 20s to early 30s who is over her heavy partying days. Tidy, responsible, employed, etc. etc. etc. <br /><br />We are trying to fit everyone in on Wednesday so please let us know if you can come! If you can&#039;t, send an email anyway and maybe we can work something out. <br /><br />PLEASE INCLUDE SOME DETAILS ABOUT YOURSELF OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A ROOM.<br />&nbsp;<br />Thanks!<br />ditmars_room@yahoo.com
