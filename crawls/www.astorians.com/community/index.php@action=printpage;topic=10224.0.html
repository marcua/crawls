				I&#039;ve been reading a lot of threads in order to better my chances of finding my own places here in the city.&nbsp; A lot of these threads, the lucky people who&#039;ve found what they&#039;re looking for, seem to have the &quot;our broker found us what we wanted at a reasonable price&quot; type of line.<br />Question:<br /><br />What is a reasonable price for a studio/1br apartment in:<br /><br />Astoria?<br />Queens?<br />LIC?<br /><br />I contacted some brokers but they don&#039;t seem to have anything in my price range (800-900).&nbsp; And the stuff that&#039;s listed on CL is ... well... crappy.<br /><br />The more and more I search for a place, the wearier I get.&nbsp; &nbsp;:oops: Sigh... this is beginning to suck big time.<br /><br /><br />

				I think the general consensus lately has seemed to be that $1200 for a one bedroom is pretty standard. I&#039;m not sure what prices studios go for.<br /><br />But maybe someone who&#039;s been hunting more recently can let us know.

Introduce yourself. Tell them the kinds of things about yourself that you want to know about them. After an email or two, you&#039;ll probably go to check the place out. Pay attention to the vibe you get there. You can usually tell.<br /><br />When I was looking for sublets, I asked people to meet me at a bar they recommended in their neighborhood for a drink before we went to see their place. It made me feel better to meet someone somewhere else, though you might want to pick coffee. I also knew, though, that anyone who wouldn&#039;t be cool with a mid-week early-evening beer is probably not the kind of person who&#039;d want to live with me. There&#039;s lots of ways that you can tell, just figure out what&#039;s important to you and start meeting people.

				FYI- if you move into a place that&#039;s rent stabilized your house mate(s) cannot charge you more than the pro-rata share- like if it&#039;s a two bedroom and the rent is 1800, they are supposed to not charge you more than 900 for 1 bedroom- illegal to do so otherwise. <br />But if it is rent controlled they can charge you whatever- go figure.
