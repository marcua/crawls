				Too bad no cilantro as advertised, but some good stuff nonetheless! I like good local garlic. And the purple string beans were quite good (despite the fact that they turn green when cooked)! <br /><br />I made a really good (if slightly too spicy) Mexican chicken and vegetable stew using most of the CSA ingredients, including the tomatillos, garlic, green beans, last week&#39;s radishes, the chiles (hot!, as Meg would say!), and the (mythical) cilantro. The recipe is here (http://harrissmithrecipes.xwiki.com/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Puebla+Chicken+and+Vegetable+Stew+with+Radish+Sauce)!<br />

				We got cilantro, so they must have run out.&nbsp; That&#39;s too bad.<br /><br />I made a salsa verde similar to the recipe in the newsletter -- it is <em>fantastic</em>.&nbsp; I broiled about a pound of tomatillos in two batches.&nbsp; Burned the second batch a little, which turned out to be a good thing.&nbsp; Pureed them (stick blender) and added them to 1 minced jalapeno (those jalapenos are amazing!), bunch of cilantro, minced, two minced garlic cloves, some minced onion.&nbsp; Added a few drops of yuzu.&nbsp; Let it sit for awhile. <br /><br />We had it two ways.<br /><br />First with porgie fillets - dipped in flour mixed with Mexican spice, then egg.&nbsp; Pan-fried golden in olive oil.&nbsp; Slathered with the salsa.&nbsp; I&#39;ve never had tomatillos be sweet like this, and it is the first time I&#39;ve ever understood tomatillo salsa as a really perfect spicy-sweet combination. <br /><br />Then I took an egg, beat it, heated the oil until nearly smoking, and poured the egg in very thin.&nbsp; We wrapped the egg with the salsa inside like a tortilla.&nbsp; The spicy sweet salsa was heaven with the egg.

				Those peppers were DEFINITELY hot. My mistake was putting in two! Should have stuck with one. Learned my lesson.<br /><br />And yeah, when Harlan and I got there, they were out of cilantro and the purple beans (Harlan got the last bag). Guess the estimations were a little off this week!
