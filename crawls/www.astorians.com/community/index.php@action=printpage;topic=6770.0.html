				from the Times...<br /><br />A 24-year-old man was stabbed to death shortly before 3 a.m. yesterday outside a strip club on Steinway Street in Astoria, the police said.<br /><br />http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/21/nyregion/21mbrfs-STABBING.html<br /><br />This happened the night of the 20-21st of June.&nbsp; My question is this...hasn&#039;t this sort of violence happened before at the same location.&nbsp; Anyone remember?<br /><br />Another question...is there really any need for a strip club in this residential neighboorhood?&nbsp; Especially with a new school going up, a movie theater and an ice cream store a block away?<br /><br />Who does one talk to about neighborhood concerns like this...a community board?&nbsp; If anyone can give me an e-mail address, I&#039;d appreciate it.<br /><br />

				a strip club is a business just like any other. i would think that the strip club hours are different than the school and ice cream shop. if there is continued crime activity at that location, then i would become concerned.

				Here&#039;s the thing; as i recall, there has been another murder outside that club--that makes two within the course of a year or so.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m surprised to find myself on the side of wanting to closing a strip club, but when an establishment becomes a magnet for violence, threatening those who patronize it and others who live in the surrounding community, perhaps it&#039;s time to re-examine said establishment&#039;s worth.<br /><br /><br />

				It&#039;s right across the street from a playground.<br /><br />At night, that area can get deserted.&nbsp; Maybe some good can come from this, in the form of police presence and community awareness.
