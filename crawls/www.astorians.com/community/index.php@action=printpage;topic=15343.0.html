				Please come to the 7th annual Musical Saw Festival: a concert and art exhibit centered around the 300-year-old art form of making music with a carpenter&#039;s handsaw. <br />Watch an attempt to set a Guinness World Record of the &quot;Largest Musical Saw Ensemble.&quot;<br /><br />(http://musicalsawfestival.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/sawfestflyer09.jpg)<br /><br />The art form of making music with a carpenter&#039;s handsaw has been around for 300 years, but has become almost forgotten since the 1930&#039;s. The festival set up to make sure this unique art form does not disappear.<br />For the past 7 years Astoria (Queens) became a pilgrimage spot for musical saw players from all over the world. <br />&nbsp;This year 40 musical saw players have registered to perform. They are coming from Japan, Belgium, Germany, Canada and all over the USA.<br /><br />The festival, which is supported by the Queens Council on the Arts, NYC Department of Cultural Affairs and the NY State Council on the Arts, includes a concert, an art exhibit and a workshop - all centered around the musical saw, of course.<br /><br />A Guinness World Record attempt for the &#039;Largest Musical Saw Ensemble&#039; will take place at the festival. The current world record, set in Poland last year, is 27 musical saw players playing together.<br /><br />Four world premiers of music written especially for the musical saw will be featured, with participation of a string quartet, handbell group, piano and soprano singer.<br /><br />For some truly &quot;cutting edge&quot; music, come see the saw players and say you saw it here first!<br /><br />When: Saturday, July 18th, 2pm<br />Where: Trinity Church, 31-18 37th Street (37th street at 31st Ave), Astoria <br />Admission: $10<br />More info: www.MusicalSawFestival.org (http://www.MusicalSawFestival.org)
