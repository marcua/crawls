				I live on 26th street, and there is this really old and beat up yellow station wagon near my apartment, and it&#039;s been there for months. I want to say it&#039;s been around 3 months, and it&#039;s never moved, and I see new tickets on it every week. So my guess is it&#039;s up to around 12+ tickets. At first, i really just thought it was an abandoned car, but, it has it&#039;s plates still on it. Do cars with this many tickets eventually get towed? Since parking spots are so precious, I do kind of get pissed off that this giant car is taking up a valuable spot right in front of my house. Anyone else know the car I&#039;m talking of?

				And in the lot on 33rd Street behind Sovereign Bank there is this ratty RV that has been sitting in the spot nearest the exit for months.&nbsp; I wonder if someone is really going and feeding the meter twice a day six days a week.

				Is it from maybe the 60s, with out of state plates, and very low to the ground?&nbsp; If so, I used to see it parked all the time on 41st St. and other places right around Ditmars and Steinway.&nbsp; I noticed a few months ago it had disappeared from that area.&nbsp; When it was there, someone was moving it regularly for alternate side parking, though.

And it does drive- the suspension I believe is pneumatic (aftermarket) and it does rise up when it drives around.

				For a while, it was just there on and off for a few weeks. No lie, its been there since the last big storm. I watched them trying to use jumper cables on it.

				.... and... the &quot;Non-Flying Dutchman&quot; has no registration, plates, inspection stickers.... completely untraceable. Soooooo... why hasn&#039;t it been towed away? That IS a public-City owned- municipal parking lot, isn&#039;t it?

				I can tell you the RV has been there since December. I live by there so I notice it everyday. I thought maybe someone lived in it too, but it was snowed in several times during last winter&#039;s storms.&nbsp; The snow plows would push the snow in front of it and there were never any tracks <br />It use to be parked on the street and had to be moved for alternate street parking. Someone from the apartment building in the middle of the block use to run electrical cords to it in the fall. <br /><br />Some cars just don&#039;t get ticketed no matter how flagrant the violation. You can either drive yourself crazy thinking about it or look on the bright side that it&#039;s not on the street anymore being an eyesore. <br />

				That car has been there since late winter. The tickets seem to disappear every week. I&#039;d imagine they don&#039;t want to tow it out of fear of damaging it, and besides, the city&#039;s making very easy money off of it.<br /><br />What I don&#039;t understand is why the owner doesn&#039;t just rent a garage or spot under the bridge. <br /><br />
