				Hello Everyone,<br /><br />I am rather new to this board and to Astoria.&nbsp; I moved here from Manhattan in the middle of February and I have been loving it ever since.&nbsp; &nbsp; I don&#39;t think I could ever move back to the city...but that is another topic. <br /><br />Anyway, I just felt the need to vent my frustrations about subway etiquette, specifically cutting one&#39;s finger/toenails (yes I have seen toe&#39;s clipped on the train&nbsp; :? :x).&nbsp; <br /><br />I feel that I am one of the few people that is truly repulsed by this practice.&nbsp; &nbsp;Why do people feel that it is okay to do this in a public place...never mind a very crowded public space like the subway.&nbsp; <br /><br />About 2 weeks ago this guy was standing in the doorway of the N/W train.&nbsp; He began to clip his fingernails for several stops.&nbsp; I could tell that they were rather large nails by the loud sound of the &quot;clip&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;I traded pissed off looks with another man on the train who was also bothered by this clipping.&nbsp; Finally, I couldn&#39;t take it anymore and I asked him to do that somewhere else and offered that it was disgusting to do this in public.&nbsp; Granted I did not say it that nicely but also said that I did not want to be hit with one of his grotesque, airborne fingernails.&nbsp; &nbsp;This S*^&amp;bag of a person replied that he does not care about me or anyone else on the train.&nbsp; We bickered back and forth and he DID stop cutting his nails.&nbsp; The other man did not feel the need to chime in I guess...which didn&#39;t help any.&nbsp; <br /><br />I just had to share this story...maybe there was someone on this board that was on the same train.&nbsp; I just am amazed at how insensitive people are towards others.&nbsp; I am a native NYer so I am not shocked by this, but I am surprised at times.&nbsp;

				I have also experienced&nbsp; being in a subway car when someone decided to cut their finger nails on the train. Its just down right gross and unsanitary.<br /><br />&nbsp;My other pet peeves include people who spit in the train, chew sunflower seeds and spitting them on the floor of the train and my personal favorite- the woman on the train who was eating fried chicken and when she was done threw the drumstick on the floor. What the h**l???? <br /><br />While it is good to speak up and say something (I often do) you just have to remember that you never know the mental state of the person you are confronting. Its not worth getting hurt over. I used to never think about that until some guy threatened me when I said something to him and I will be honest he really scared me. <br /><br />Though chances are if I was on the train with you I probably would have spoken up as well. <br /><br />

				People can be pigs on the subway.&nbsp; Toenail and fingernail clipping should not be done in public.&nbsp; I don&#39;t get why people can&#39;t take their own trash with them off the train.&nbsp; Who raised these people!?

				I think many people just don&#39;t think to try and be well mannered on the trains.&nbsp; Have you seen where people won&#39;t even move over to let people sit, even if there is clearly space.&nbsp; One shouldn&#39;t have to say something and they should have the decency to slide over for the elderly and for pregnant women, heck, even for people with packages.

				I think that&#39;s actually very polite (newspapers, so long as they&#39;re not all mangled or have stuff on them are reuseable).&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#39;ve seen people pick up newspapers that were left.&nbsp; The only problem I&#39;d see is if they&#39;re tossed onto the floor or litered about, dismantled.&nbsp; I usually take them off the train and sit them on top of the trashcan so people have the option of claiming them.

				I ver leave my paper on a subway seat, because often times it can falls on the floor or somebody just pushes off the seat, and then it scatters. Many times I&#39;ve picked up papers from subway car floors on my way off the train. It&#39;s a nice gesture to share your paper, but since the train doesn&#39;t have a table to leave it behind on, it will inevitably end up on the floor. I still feel it best to trash it.

				day before yesterday this teenage couple totally grossed me out.<br />she was trying to pop zits on his nose and was practically standing on the seat to get more leverage while he braced himself with the poles. She&#39;s&nbsp; saying wait! almost! hold still!&nbsp; &nbsp;OVER and <br />OVER , but the car was swaying too much for her which is why she then climbed up on the seat and had him grasp the poles.&nbsp; I thought are you kidding me? Now someone has to sit in your pus?<br />&nbsp; another time a few years ago some woman clipped her nails then pulled out a mirror and started to do a big session of eyebrow tweezing, I thought she was insane, then a man gets on the train and recognizes her and they start having friendly conversation. she was not at all embarrassed that she was in the middle of eyebrow tweezing.

				I had an interesting situation this morning.&nbsp; What is acceptable if a person has long hair, ties it up behind them in some sort of ponytail and then it pokes out over their seat into the seat behind them.&nbsp; I got hit with the ponytail about eight times before I finally gave up and moved to a different seat.&nbsp; Two other people who chose that seat did the same thing.&nbsp; I didn&#39;t know even what to say in this sort of a situation.&nbsp; I don&#39;t even know if she felt her hair smacking people - it was pretty itchy too!

				yeah, I would think that would be bad, and it was smacking all up against the pole between the two seats as well.&nbsp; I would think it wasn&#39;t so sanitary, but I didn&#39;t know what to say to her or how to broach it (very rare for me to be tongue-tied), but it was just such a strange experience.&nbsp; I wouldn&#39;t have hesitated to ask her to move a bag or umbrella if it was poking me, but her hair was unexpected.

				Re: fingernail clippings. Yes, absolutely NARSTY. But, I make it a policy to not tell strangers on trains what they should or shouldn&#39;t do. I feel it&#39;s not really my business, as long as the clippings aren&#39;t flying at my face or on my sudoku.<br /><br />If these jerks don&#39;t know it by now that doing things like that is so classless, then I am afraid, they will just continue to do it.<br /><br />I leave the maleducados to their own devices.

				I think Mayor Mike should take on courtesy/etiquette and bombard the city with public service announcements.&nbsp; I have a huge peeve over people leaving their garbage behind (except newspapers) and the reason &quot;it&#39;s giving someone (janitor) a job.&quot;&nbsp; Year after year of teaching I hear repeatedly from my students that their making a mess is really not a problem because it&#39;s someone else&#39;s job to clean up.&nbsp; I figure that they learn from their parents....<br /><br />so my idea for an ad campaign:&nbsp; If New Yorkers could see what could be done with the money SAVED from not having to hire so many sanitation workers... they might start to change their ways.&nbsp; So.... you see an army of sanitation workers cleaning up big gross messes and then you jump cut to beautiful parks, clean streets, new text books, art education, clean people friendly waterfronts, free candy, more gardens, more flowers, smaller class sizes, less crowded public transit.&nbsp; <br /><br />the message.... see what you COULD have if we didn&#39;t have to spend so much @@(*@#$&nbsp; money on cleaning up after you!!!!<br /><br /><br />just an idea.... does anyone work for Ogilvy?? or the mayor??<br /><br />

				Argh.&nbsp; The littering really grates my nerves.&nbsp; I mean, you live in one of the most littered filthy cities in the US, you would think you would do your part to NOT contribute to it, right?&nbsp; Wrong.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#39;s just incredibly ironic to me that people complain about the rats, mice, cockroaches, bad smells, etc.&nbsp; Where do they think it comes from?&nbsp; And the MTA doesn&#39;t help either by foregoing much needed cleanings on a lot of the cars.&nbsp; However, that&#39;s another point.&nbsp; But seriously, when that woman throws her nasty ass chicken bone on the floor, who does she honestly think is going to benefit from that?&nbsp; When I see someone doing something like that it makes me want to ask them - exactly how many times have you seen someone scrubbing down the subway?&nbsp; Uh huh...I haven&#39;t seen any either.&nbsp; <br /><br />Oh, and the excuse that it gives someone a job to clean up after them..oh that is rich.&nbsp; You know, people are constantly complaining about the fare hikes, the overcrowding, the old subway cars.&nbsp; Next time uses that excuse, I would remind them that increasing need for workers who otherwise might not be needed as much also increases their subway fare and the general crappiness of our transit system.

				What&#39;s wrong with putting makeup on during the train ride? I mean, I don&#39;t do it because I don&#39;t want a mascara wand lodged in my cornea, but putting makeup on is like the least disgusting thing someone could do. I&#39;m kind of mesmerized when someone does this, esp. if it turns out looking okay with all the bumps, swaying, etc the train does.

				A woman sitting next to me on the N started clipping her nails the other day. So disgusting. I hadn&#39;t actually witnessed someone doing that on the train before. I frowned in her direction, but she didn&#39;t seem to notice/care. I&#39;m generally ok with people doing a lot of things on the train as long as they don&#39;t involve stray particles flying around, people making out, or anything really smelly. Makeup doesn&#39;t bother me, though I don&#39;t do that myself.<br /><br />A grown man was tossing around a basketball on the train a couple days ago. He kept missing it and people were glaring at him as it almost hit them, but he just kept doing it. He had a kid with him, too, who wasn&#39;t interested in the ball. What the hell is wrong with some people?

				I have a problem with neighbors leaving their trash in the hallway too. It&#39;s so disgusting. I&#39;m actually surprised that the problem is this common because I thought it was really bizarre. Their trash doesn&#39;t actually block anyone&#39;s path getting through the hall, it just stinks up the place real bad. <br /><br />Like with people being gross on the subway, I don&#39;t understand how people can do this stuff and not be concerned about how it affects others. I mean, I&#39;m guessing they put the trash in the hallway because they don&#39;t want their apartment to smell like trash. So instead we all have to smell it when we go into the hall, and when it gets really bad it seeps through the doorway and we can smell it in <em>our</em> apartment. So gross.

				This is a problem in my building, too.&nbsp; The best days are the really hot ones when the people next door have left a (clear) bag out full of diapers.&nbsp; What is wrong with people?

				I&#39;m surprised that people leaving trash in the hallways is such a common problem too. I&#39;ve luckily never had to deal with that, but I totally don&#39;t understand that laziness/disregard, or why it&#39;s such a problem to take the garbage outside. Gross.
