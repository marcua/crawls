				Sounds exciting, there is a place on Ditmars and 21st that is heavy on the meats, although I think it&#039;s German.<br /><br />What ever happened to Spiced? I always wanted to go, and kept putting it off. Never did see a big crowd in there.<br />

				I believe that The Thirsty Koala is an Australian inspired casual eatery focusing on healthy all natural food&nbsp; I spoke to the chef/owner outside today on Ditmars and in her own words the food will be varied selection which reflects Australia&#039;s multi culturalism.&nbsp; &nbsp; They will have a full bar as well as coffees teas etc.&nbsp; She also told me they were changing the entire look of the place and it will be very light and airy.&nbsp; They are focusing on fresh food and friendly service (in her own words)<br />I have to say they have planted a great garden outside and have a very cute koala in the window&nbsp; I think its great that we are getting different places on Ditmars and will try out when it opens

				I stopped in when i saw Door was opened while renovation was going on.&nbsp; Looks like they are doing a great job brightening the place up. Nice warm and welcoming colors.&nbsp; I spoke to the owner Cathy, she was very nice and took her time explaining what they were looking to do for the neighborhood. Finally someone with a idea and a plan not just another sushi or pizza place.&nbsp; Healthy choices, I can&#039;t wait. Just had surgery and need to be more selective with my eating choices.&nbsp; I hope the food is great.&nbsp; I would love to be able to support a local business with owners that are very nice and who live and have a vested interest in our neighborhood.&nbsp; Vin

				They&#039;re all set up and ready to go... Just don&#039;t want to open until they can serve their beverages, too, which were approved this yesterday.&nbsp; Just waiting for the final licensing, and hope to be open by next weekend.&nbsp; They&#039;ll be serving Fosters and Coopers on tap, with several craft beers from Australia, and New Zealand... even an alcoholic finger beer from Glasgow, UK.&nbsp; Also Australia inspired cocktails, included two versions of housemade bloody mary...one green (with jalapenos) and one classic.&nbsp; I&#039;ve sampled some of the dishes, and loved everything.&nbsp; Super fresh, clean flavors, with a lot of surprises (the homemade chevre on crostini with plums and prosciutto is killer).<br /><br /><br />http://www.bradleyhawks.com/2012/12/first-look-at-thirsty-koala-menu.html

				I passed by today around 12:30 and they were open so I walked in to ask some questions and get a menu.&nbsp; I inquired about lunch and they told me they have brunch till I think 3:30 and then dinner starts at 4:00 or 4:30.&nbsp; I told them I would like to come for lunch but they don&#039;t even have a lunch menu.&nbsp; I think that&#039;s kind of strange.&nbsp; They said they would accommodate me if I come for lunch but if they don&#039;t have a lunch menu then I dont&#039; think I&#039;ll be going there for lunch.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s strange to only have brunch. I think they will be losing a lot of customers if they don&#039;t have a lunch menu.&nbsp; I go out for lunch on the weekend more than I go for dinner.

				braun, isn&#039;t brunch just a combination of breakfast food and lunch food? Did you look at the brunch menu to see what they offer? Maybe there are things that could be eaten for your lunch meal.<br /><br />I ate here last night. I was out of town since Friday and didn&#039;t realize yesterday was actually their opening day. There were some hiccups in service, but since it was their opening day I won&#039;t bother going into detail about that. I will say that the fish tacos I got were delicious. They were impossible to eat as tacos - they were piled high on soft tortillas and had to be eaten with knife and fork - but the quality and flavor were very good, and I was happy to be eating them and would eat them again. <br /><br />There were a couple other items we ordered that should probably be described more clearly on the menu to avoid unhappy customers in ways that can be prevented. The panini are served on thick, very crunchy bread; not what I think of when I think of panini. I was imagining something more along the lines of what Il Bambino serves, or most places in New York that serve panini, being a grilled flatbread sandwich. Also, what is described as &quot;apple pie&quot; on the menu didn&#039;t resemble pie at all. It was cooked/seasoned apples and grapes and cream on a slice of thick bread, possibly the same bread used for the panini. <br /><br />Neither of those items was bad, but if they&#039;d been more clearly described we would&#039;ve ordered different things, as I was there with a rather picky eater. It was the sort of thing where we thought we knew what we were getting based on the menu description (they seemed straightforward enough) but when the items arrived we were surprised by what we got, as it was not in line with our expectations. I&#039;ve been to a lot of restaurants and am not used to that happening.

				The brunch menu doesn&#039;t appeal to me at all.&nbsp; I go out for breakfast and have eggs so when I go out for lunch I want a real lunch, not brunch.&nbsp; Most of the things on the brunch menu are eggs.&nbsp; The dinner menu looks very interesting. They should put some of those things on the lunch menu.&nbsp; Maybe eventually they will change and eliminate brunch and have regular lunch instead.&nbsp; I think that would attract more customers.

				Hello Astorians.&nbsp; I&#039;m Kathy Fuchs, an owner and the executive chef at The Thirsty Koala.&nbsp; First and foremost, I just read all of the posts about us and I&#039;m so happy that you were excited about seeing us open.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to keep that excitement going so please believe me when I tell you that we want you to enjoy the food.&nbsp; I&#039;ve read your comments about brunch and lunch.&nbsp; During the week our regular menu of&nbsp; tapas, burgers, tacos, jaffles and crostis are available all day long.&nbsp; We only did brunch for Christmas Eve and we offer brunch on Saturdays and Sundays.&nbsp; At your suggestion, the regular menu will also be available during the day on the weekends.&nbsp; Our dinner entree menu kicks in after 4 pm.<br /><br /><br />So we will work on the bread, we will improve the descriptions and we want you to tell us what you think of the food.&nbsp; We do listen.<br /><br /><br />Warm regards and Merry Christmas.

				I would like to come there this Sunday for lunch to celebrate my birthday.&nbsp; I am only coming with one friend.&nbsp; I am disappointed that you don&#039;t have a lunch menu because I don&#039;t want to come for brunch.&nbsp; I never eat brunch because I get up early on the weekend and like to go out for a nice breakfast so when lunchtime comes I don&#039;t want to have eggs again for brunch.&nbsp; I want to go out for lunch and would hope that the restaurant I am going to has a lunch menu.&nbsp; Now I am forced to go for dinner instead of lunch just because at lunchtime you will be having brunch.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; I hope that in the future this will be changed because I have no desire whatsoever to go out for brunch anywhere.&nbsp; Personally, I think you will do more business if you serve a regular lunch instead of brunch.

Besides, they said they&#039;ll be serving much of their non-brunch menu during brunch, so you could try anything off that at lunch time. I don&#039;t see why you are still disappointed about this. Is there a specific lunch item you have in mind that they don&#039;t offer?

				I ate at this place twice over the weekend:&nbsp; Dinner on Friday and brunch today.<br />&nbsp;<br />I&#039;m paraphrasing from the review I just posted on Yelp as I think this place is really great and will very quickly grow it&#039;s following:<br />&nbsp;<br />On Friday night they were packed to the gills but very accomodating in getting us a table for four.&nbsp; Because of how busy they were the food did take a bit of time to come out on Friday night.&nbsp; That said, Christine (one of the owners) came by right after we ordered and explained that everything is made to order so it does take a little extra time (trust me - the wait is worth it!).&nbsp; When it appeared that our food was going to take longer than normal both Christne and Kathy (the executive chef) made a pont to come by and apologize and offered us free dessert for the table (a very generous offer which we happily accepted given what we had heard about the desserts here!)&nbsp; The food was amazing across the board and we all left with full tummies and smiles on our faces.<br /><br /><br />Today, I met up with friends for brunch and the food/service was equally as wonderful.&nbsp; Again both Christine and Kathy stopped by the table to say hi and you can tell that they are very excited to be giving something unique back to the neighbourhood (I believe that all three owners are Astorians!).&nbsp; Also, you can order from the regular menu if brunch isn&#039;t your thing.<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />As in all new businesses, there are bound to be hiccups in the first few weeks but this place has been going to great lengths to get things ironed out right away.&nbsp; It&#039;s a welcomed addition to the neighbouhood and I can&#039;t wait to slowly eat my way through the entire menu!<br /><br />&nbsp;

				I went there yesterday for lunch and was very impressed.&nbsp; First of all I would like to say they did a great job with the renovations.&nbsp; It is so warm and welcoming when you go inside.&nbsp; I like the Australian decorations on the walls and also the relaxing music they had playing.&nbsp; I ordered the vegan tacos and my friend ordered the steak sandwich.&nbsp; Mine tasted delicious.&nbsp; It was slightly spicy and had a white sauce on it.&nbsp; The owner came over to introduce herself. She was very nice and from Australia.&nbsp; The service was a little slow, but I think that&#039;s to be expected since they haven&#039;t been open for very long.

				I had brunch and dinner there over the weekend. They have a large selection of brunch sandwiches on excellent ciabatta from Leli, plus a few other brunch dishes, and also their full menu, as others have noted. My sandwich was very tasty, although not as spicy as the name (The Spicy) implied. I also tried their Australian iced coffee (despite the weather) because it has ice cream in it. How can that go wrong? (It can&#039;t.)<br /><br />I went back for dinner because I really wanted to try their works burger, with toppings popular in Australia, including pineapple, beet slaw, and a fried egg. It was awesome. The meat (which is sourced from Australia) had outstanding flavour, and I enjoyed the toppings, even the pineapple, which I was a little uncertain about. At first I thought the roll might be a little too dense, but it stood up well to the giant stack the toppings created, and lasted the whole burger without disintegrating. My next burger there will be a plain one, though, simply to get more of the meat flavour. Definitely one of the best burgers I&#039;ve ever had.<br />

Not surprised that your waiter wasn&#039;t surprised. Those guys are very humble and seem to be surprised if you say anything nice about their amazing food. Also, once when I ordered it took a while to come to the table and when they brought it I was told that the guy who makes them just got there and that he is the one who knows the special way to make them. Maybe you got one that was made by someone other than that guy or he wasn&#039;t around and they gave you some other generic iced tea. Trust me, what I have had was some extraordinary stuff and was apparently made using some specific process.

				Really tasty food, but the service is SO&nbsp; slow - after ordering, we waited for 30m before the waitress told us that they did not have what we had ordered anymore. This was followed by another 30m wait to eventually get our brunch. Tables near ours seemed to have had similar issues.<br />It is a pity, if it weren&#039;t for this (and I have heard of other people complaining about the slow service) it would be a top place in the dittmars area - as it is, it is just not for me.

				I&#039;ve being there to pick up some food and for a sitting dinner and I hey to say that the waiting time was definitely reasonable. Place was busy but not packed, I&#039;m not sure how the same could work for lunch/brunch thought.<br />I agree that the food is really good and the care and pride they take in describing their style and operation in general is refreshing. Definitely a great change to the panorama in Ditmars and a great addition!<br />Ivan<br /><br /><br />Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk HD

				I went there 2 times when they first opened.&nbsp; I think that was in December or January and had the same problem waiting a very long time for the food to be served.&nbsp; I thought they would have fixed that problem by now.&nbsp; This will definitely hurt their business.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t seem to be as crowded as it used to be.&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t that impressed by the food and I thought that they were overpriced also.&nbsp; I dont think I&#039;ll be going back.

				I also must say that I was sadly underwhelmed and have not had a burning desire to return.&nbsp; Has the bar opened yet?&nbsp; Our first negative experience was with them announcing these spectacular cocktails and then planning to meet friends only to learn they had no liquor license.&nbsp; But we returned to try the food.&nbsp; I don&#039;t object to paying good money for outstanding food, but in this case I agree they are charging a bit much for what we were served.&nbsp; And our service was also a little &quot;off&quot; both in timing and with oddities like saying goodnight before our entrees were served.&nbsp; I chalked it all up to being new so I do want to try it again and hoped that the warmer weather would be better for this place.&nbsp; I can picture cold Aussie beers and their tasty tacos being a nice way to spend time there.&nbsp; &nbsp;They did such a nice job with the place and the menu is creative and the food was not bad.&nbsp; I hope they pull it together a bit and succeed.&nbsp;

				I don&#039;t understand what&#039;s holding up the liquor license. They obviously planned on opening with it but something&#039;s gone wrong. I went there for dinner last week, and it was an unorganized mess. Long waits to be seated, tables all out of order, people&#039;s BYOB trash lingering around everywhere. We sat at the bar because we couldn&#039;t get a table. The bar was covered in trash and junk, like they don&#039;t have a storage closet for all the excess pitchers and glasses and cutlery. Some employee&#039;s half empty smoothy was just sitting there. My girlfriend said her tacos were good, but my burger was disappointing. I feel like once they get their bar functioning, they&#039;ll have to clean it up and make it presentable, and maybe then the dominoes will fall into place. People&#039;s BYOB trash will be gone, more people will be able to sit at the bar, and the bartender will be an extra employee (which they can really use).

				Went there this week for the first time. Food is delicious though the wait time is very annoying. Our waitress was very friendly and apologized for the delay, but something needs to be fixed there. Having no liquor license is a big problem I know the restaurant industry and sometimes these things take time, but things like that should be taken care of before opening. Seems like they have a bit of a management problem in the place itself and in the kitchen. Hopefully they improve as I really liked their food.&nbsp;

				I had an underwhelming experience about two months back.&nbsp; Our order did come out quickly but that was partially due to the fact that we gave them advance warning that we only had a certain amount of time before we had to leave.&nbsp; We shared the fried fish as an app. and it went mostly uneaten.&nbsp; The batter of the fish was soggy and not crispy at all and flavorless.&nbsp; I had the tacos for an entree and they were decent but nothing special.&nbsp; I was hoping for a more unique dining experience, but sadly it was a pretty average and the fish was kind of gross.

				I&#039;ve been twice since it opened and am pretty pleased. Good service, no wait, good food on both my visits, but about the liquor license - when Bareburger opened on 31st street I remember it took AGES until they got their liquor license. Seriously... at least 4 months. I think it just takes a suuuuper long time to happen. But I agree it would be nice and I&#039;m getting impatient too!!

				They should have applied for the license when they were renovating. I understand if it takes them 2 months or so after they open to get it. But taking longer than that is not good.

				I apologize if this is way off, but could the license issue have anything to do with that address?&nbsp; I say this because Spiced had also built a nice, full bar and they too never stocked it with liquor and it became a junk/storage area.&nbsp; I just wonder if there might be problems related to the property owner at that address.

				TJT, that would make sense. Maybe the owner doesn&#039;t want to sign the paperwork for a liquor license or have other issues. I would think koala would want to get the liquor license ASAP given summer is coming.

But they must have been lead on to believe they&#039;d get the license; otherwise why would they build a bar? Why would they build a cocktail menu and talk about getting fosters on draft? Talk about getting screwed.<br /><br /><br />It&#039;s also worth noting that Tufino is having the same problem. They both opened up around the same time with intentions of selling alcohol, and they both talked about Sandy pushing back the liquor license process. Singlecut&#039;s license was also delayed after Sandy, but they were able to resolve it pretty quickly.
