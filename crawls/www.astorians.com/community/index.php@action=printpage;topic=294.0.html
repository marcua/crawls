				For all you TECH SAVY people and all you Limewire, Kazza people.<br /><br />My brother was watching Tech TV on demand, it is one of his favorite things to do. On one of their shows they talked about this program that is like limewire, but oh so much better because it is more private and more safer. It allows you to Share personal files directly with your friends...privately. What even better is the software is free and EASY TO USE. <br /><br />There is no spyware or adware of any kind. You can chat with your friends, Im your friends, stream music to your friends, its all built in with this program. It is so cool.<br /><br />First of all I can make different groups. Then you can assign each group how many things you want to share. You can choose and entire folder, or you can choose just a few files in different folders. For instance, by brother basically can download whatever he wants from my computer, the rest of my family can only download my music, videos, anime, and pictures so they get a different group. You can have as many different groups as you like. It is so fun. If I know you and you want to join my group and share some of my stuff I have no problem with that. The name of the software is grouper. The website is http://www.grouper.com/ <br /><br />It is an awsome program. They also have an option to make groups public for downloading at a later date, but I am fine with keeping them private and just sharing my files with my family and friends for now. Only people who you invite, can download from you.
