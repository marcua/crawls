				Eddie Vedder has one of the best voices in rock. I&#039;d blow some cash on Pearl Jam too.&nbsp; congratulations.&nbsp; Not a big fan of flight of the concord guys.&nbsp; Didn&#039;t like the series much.&nbsp; But I bet you&#039;ll have a blast seeing them in person.&nbsp; Probably a different experience.

				I saw flight of the conchords at Bonnaroo 2007 and although it was more of a comedy showcase rather than a concert, it was fun and funny. I had never seen their television program at the time. I am a big fan of the show now though. Should be a good time.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never seen Pearl Jam but when I was younger I just didn&#039;t &quot;get it&quot;. Now I can appreciate them more and hope to catch them live someday. Enjoy those shows dude, sounds like you&#039;ve got two great nights ahead of you.

I wanted to go to both shows, but could only get tickets to one. and the seats TOTALLY suck. They&#039;re in the highest possible section, although at least they&#039;re more towards the middle. The show is gonna be undoubtedly awesome, but I just wish I had better seats, and to both shows. I mean the tickets wound up being like $90 each!!&nbsp; <br />And I &lt;3 flight of the conchords. Which is why I now hate you. <br /><br />What the hell is Bonnaroo?

				The two times I went to bonnaroo (2006 &amp; 2007) were some of the best and most fun times I have ever had on any vacation period. It&#039;s more than the music, it&#039;s just a terrific experience overall. I highly highly recommend it.
