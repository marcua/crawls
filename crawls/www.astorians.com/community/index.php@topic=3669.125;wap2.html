			Hey all,<br /><br />This is a plug to &quot;like&quot; the Queens Greenmarkets facebook page, and -- regardless of whether you&#039;re a Facebook user or not -- to visit Queens first year round market in Jackson Heights every Sunday 8am-3pm (vendors have been there this entire month despite the brutal cold). It&#039;s a ten minute bike ride from Astoria (I recommend 31st Ave as the preferred route to get there and back).<br /><br /><br />Support the people bringing you cellared and fresh greenhouse vegetables, fruits and juices (inc. hot cider), delicious pastries and artisan breads (the latter which is an investment in entrepreneurial activities of immigrant women), farmstead cheeses, local honey, wild mushrooms, wild local seafood, pastured poultry and meats, and wine from local vineyards. Textiles recycling, too.<br /><br />And don&#039;t hold your breath or anything, but Astoria might just be getting a new market this coming season.<br /><br />Fingers crossed.

			The Jackson Heights market is really great.&nbsp; I absolutely jealous of it and wish that Astoria would get one too.&nbsp; All the ones we do have that are even remotely like it are way too far in very inconvenient areas.&nbsp;

			Socrates is pretty decent, and in a great (though not necessarily convenient for all) location. The Sunnyside market is also great, and a really quick bike ride from southern Astoria.

It is a great way to fully utilize your vegetable&#039;s potential, even the parts you&#039;re not eating!!<br /><br />Drop-offs are accepted on:<br /><br />Sundays from 9am to 12pm<br /><br />There is one that may be closer to a lot of other in Sunnyside (Skillman Ave b/t 42 &amp; 43 Streets) and they accept drop-offs until the 17th of November on:<br /><br />Saturdays from 9am - 12pm <br /><br />check out http://bignyc.org/western-queens-compost-initiative for information on what to compost and the WQCI <br />
