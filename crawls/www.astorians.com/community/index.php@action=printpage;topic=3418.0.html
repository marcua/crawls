				Does anyone have a recommendation for a house cleaner or a service?<br /><br />We have a decent sized 2 bedroom apt, and would like it scrubbed up a few times a month (every other week i guess) on a weekend.&nbsp; I&#39;ve seen some ads on Craigslist, but I&#39;m not sure about just choosing one at random.<br /><br />Any suggestions would be much appreciated!<br /><br />~Julie

				I don&#39;t have a suggestion, but was going to post looking for the same thing. I&#39;m wary about using a service or person without a recommendation - any are appreciated!

I accepted. You have nothing to lose to have her come to your house and discuss rates. If it is too high, I&#39;d tell her. She might be flexible. I can tell you one thing though . . . she is fast and thorough and she takes suggestions and criticism very well. I would expect her *not* to agree to be paid by the hour. There are times that she starts with my bedroom, and then I go in there, fall asleep, wake up a few hours later and she is gone and my house is sparkling! <br /><br />I have a couple of friends who also use her during the week while they are at work. She has their house keys.

				We&#39;ve been wanting someone to come in and clean, too.&nbsp; This is definitely a good thread.&nbsp; One of the women who cleans at my office is going to be looking for house cleaning work starting in January, so I might have her come by.&nbsp; I&#39;ll let y&#39;all know how that goes, but maybe I&#39;ll call Fabiana in the meantime...
