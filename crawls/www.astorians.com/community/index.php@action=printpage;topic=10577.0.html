I&#039;ve never seen it more than five. And what place in the city isn&#039;t there &quot;a cover charge to dance&quot;? I mean, sometimes bars have music and a few people dance. But real club places to dance with DJs like the WTB has often have covers.<br /><br />Now, the liquor is overpriced, true. <br /><br />I didn&#039;t know they had food, so I can&#039;t comment there.

				I went here last week, for the RadioLab special, and it was great&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />Beautiful views, laid back atmosphere.<br /><br />Yes, the alcohol is overpriced. Def. But the food is cheap. I got some fries for like $3.

				They used to.&nbsp; But they called it &quot;Water Taxi Beach Beer&#039; or just simply &#039;Beach Beer.&#039;&nbsp; The first year or so they used Pabst Blue Ribbon and called it Beach Beer.<br /><br />This year it&#039;s just Peroni (ugh!), Gaffel (sorta okay) and Orileo-something-or-other...it&#039;s an organic beer and I think it&#039;s pretty bad, but others may like it.&nbsp; IMHO, stick with Gaffel.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />And happy hour this year is 4pm to 5pm.&nbsp; WTB has gone the way of the Beer Garden and PS1 Warm-Up.&nbsp; Too touristy and overpriced.&nbsp; But that&#039;s the way things go...it&#039;s like when you &#039;discover&#039; a cool band in a dark and dingy club, but then they start playing stadiums and arenas and you&#039;re like, &#039;ugh, I saw them way back when when they were cooler.&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)

				Peroni is better than Gaffel. In any event both of them are better than Schaeffer or Pabst Blue Ribbon which IMHO are in the same league as the piss water Bud, Miller and Coors.
