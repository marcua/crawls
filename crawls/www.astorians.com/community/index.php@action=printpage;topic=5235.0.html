				I eat at the Chipotle on 8th St off Broadway from time to time, and I like it. I wish they wouldn&#39;t charge $1.75 for guacamole on a burrito, but their stuff is tasty, their staff is really efficient, and I feel good about the meat. And they put some sort of lime-heroin-salt on their chips... yum.

				I just got back from Chipotle on 26th and 7th Ave. I ordered steak crunchy tacos with the corn salsa, they gave me chicken. When I got to the cash register I was told my tacos and drink were on the house since they got my order wrong. SCORE.&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				Chipotle is quite good.&nbsp; The food is quality, the service is always top notch and they give to charity.&nbsp; They&#39;ve made food donations to the autism agency for which I work for two years straight.&nbsp; They are a very good corporation and I eat there with some regularity because they 1 - have good food, and 2 - are good people.

				I&#39;ve eaten at Chipotle and enjoy it.&nbsp; I especially like to eat the burrito without the wrap, so just the filling itself.&nbsp; Or a salad, and they have a very tasty dressing they serve with it.&nbsp; It&#39;s probably the only &quot;fast food&quot; I eat.

				This thread got me in the mood for chipotle for lunch.&nbsp; Fortunately I tend to eat a late lunch so the line wasn&#39;t long.&nbsp; (34th &amp; 8th)&nbsp; chicken burrito.&nbsp; I like their corn sauce.&nbsp; I wish they had whole wheat tortillas and brown rice, though.<br /><br />I went into the chipotle in the Empire State once.&nbsp; It smelled terrible!&nbsp; It actually smelled like a slaughterhouse.&nbsp; I know they pride themselves on fresh food but that&#39;s taking it a bit too far.&nbsp; I don&#39;t think I can bring myself to go back to that one.<br /><br />I will pronounce it chi-PODDLE no matter what.

				You know you can place your order online before going over to avoid the lines.&nbsp; Saw my boss doing this the other day and I gotta say it looked pretty neat.&nbsp; If you go to www.chipotle.com and click on &quot;order&quot; it takes you there.&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />

				I&#039;m not a fan of Chipotle.&nbsp; Went to one once (52nd St.) and didn&#039;t like the assembly-line Subway kind of feel of it.&nbsp; It ended up being too pricey for a burrito when Burritoville is across the street and is much tastier with healthier burritos.&nbsp; A friend of mine used to go to Chipotle and get veggie burritos, then did a nutrition information check on their website and determined that one burrito (veggie, mind you) had about 800 calories.&nbsp; Be careful out there, people!

				I think McDonald&#039;s is the parent company. <br /><br />They also give away free burritos on Halloween if you wear any tin foil (burrito costume). My first time there I told the guy behind the counter that I had never had Chipotle before and he gave me a burrito, chips, guacamole and a large drink on the house. Pretty nice.

				Love me some Chipotle.&nbsp; The one by my office (48th and 6th) also has a line out the door from about noon to 3pm so I never go.&nbsp; Personally I think Moe&#039;s Southwestern Grill is even better (http://www.moes.com/index.aspx) but there aren&#039;t any in the city.&nbsp; We always hit the one in Long Island when we go to see my Grandma!

				mcdonald&#039;s is not the parent company of chipotle. it used to own a majority interest in chipotle but that is no longer the case.<br /><br />burritos are pretty calorie-filled. the tortillas alone take a big chunk out of anyone&#039;s dietary day. and burritoville&#039;s offerings aren&#039;t necessarily healthier across the board.

				You can do OK at Chipotle calorie-wise if you go with the Bol (no wrap) with lettuce (not rice) and don&#039;t add too much sour cream or cheese.
