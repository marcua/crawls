				I walked by this place yesterday and saw that it was open so I decided to go in.&nbsp; This is the place that used to be Waltz on Ditmars near 23rd St.&nbsp; It has a very relaxed atmosphere.&nbsp; I saw a few people there relaxing with their laptops.&nbsp; I asked about the prices of the crepes and they told me the sweet crepes are $6 and the other crepes are $8.&nbsp; I think those prices are reasonable.&nbsp; I&#039;m going to check this out one day.

				Hey there! Thanks for inquiring and hope you liked the vibe at Locus! Do you remember who you spoke to in reference to the prices?!<br />There seems to be a confusion so I will definitely need to work this out with our staff, so just for clarification purposes, all of our crepes <br />(sweet and savory) are $10. Sweet crepes come with a side of Greek yogurt, topped with a sweet wine fig reduction and walnuts and the <br />savory crepes come with mixed greens topped with Marsala vinaigrette. They are both hefty, filling dishes and the price is still pretty <br />reasonable! Can&#039;t wait to have you back for a taste of our products! Thanks again for posting and check us out on facebook.com/locuscafe :)

				Ten bucks for a pancake?&nbsp; :undecided: <br /><br />I&#039;d be flabbergasted if the crepes I make cost more than 50 cents a piece. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s worth it though... lol, the neighborhood surely has changed...

				Christina, I&#039;m sure you&#039;re cool. And I&#039;m sure your pancakes (crepes) are tasty. Just not $10 tasty. No pancake is. <br /><br />The only funny story I have today is that I prepared to write exactly the same post I did after I read the first post saying a crepe was $6, before you said it was $10.<br /><br />But maybe I&#039;ll drop by for some coffee though, even if the laptop-crowd is a bit boring.

				Amen! I imagine it&#039;s pretty stressful to start a new business in NYC. I prefer to give these&nbsp; businesses, especially the ones with owners who come to the site and are welcoming to everyone, a chance and the benefit of the doubt. If you don&#039;t want to support them, that&#039;s fine, but criticizing them or their business (especially before you&#039;ve ever been) isn&#039;t necessary or productive.

				I stopped in yesterday just to have a look around and every table was filled.&nbsp; I&#039;m glad they&#039;re doing good business.&nbsp; I like the atmosphere but I still think $10 for a crepe was too expensive and also the coffee and teas were pretty high priced too.

				We finally stopped in and loved it!&nbsp; I had the New Yorker crepe (pastrami, cheese, horseradish sauce).&nbsp; Delicious!&nbsp; The side salad was fresh, cold and crisp.&nbsp; I loved the Marsala vinegrette.&nbsp; As was the Chai Charger which has chai tea, espresso, and steamed milk.&nbsp; Nice and relaxing.&nbsp; I&#039;m glad they&#039;re there and they seem to be doing very well.

				We just tried this place out on Saturday, and were impressed. Service was excellent, food was fantastic (one chicken crêpe, one &quot;upstream&quot; with salmon, and one fruit), atmosphere was relaxed and pleasant, and the prices were eminently fair. My dad raved about the coffee, which I&#039;ve never heard him do. We had three kids with us, who were pretty well-behaved but, you know, little kids, and it was a welcoming environment for them, too (they had some coloring books &amp; crayons, even). Very glad to have them in the neighborhood!!<br /><br /><br />(Also, thank you to the owner or representative who&#039;s been posting here - I&#039;ve loved seeing your positive, non-defensive responses to negative comments!)

Although I am no longer part owner at the shop, I still love hearing people&#039;s perspectives about a place that&#039;s half my soul. My son loved the coloring books as well- so we left them there to pay it forward! Enjoy &amp; happy spring!!

				I went here to eat for the first time on Saturday afternoon and was pleasantly surprised.&nbsp; First of all I want to say that I love the atmosphere in there.&nbsp; It is so completely relaxing and the music they were playing made me want to stay there a while even after I finished my crepe.&nbsp; They have the radio on a jazz station, but when I was there they were playing R &amp; B classics on that station.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t heard those songs in a really long time and they brought back such good memories.&nbsp; Now about my crepe.&nbsp; I ordered the crepe that had grilled chicken, avocados, tomatoes and tahini sauce.&nbsp; All I could say is that it tasted really good and when I was finished I was stuffed.&nbsp; I would actually have to say that the portion size was too big for me.&nbsp; I could have eaten half a crepe and it would have been enough for me.&nbsp; Overally I highly recommend this place

				I like this place a lot but feel that it&#039;s a bit overpriced.&nbsp; I got a shake there yesterday and it cost $6.&nbsp; &nbsp;It was nothing special and wasn&#039;t very large for that price.

				I made it over there this past week and I agree pretty much with the majority.&nbsp; The atmosphere was great, the employees (who I believe included the owner) were super friendly, and the crepe itself was great.&nbsp; <br /><br />BUT...I&#039;m just not seeing $10 for a sweet crepe no matter.&nbsp; $6-8 would be reasonable I think.

				<br />I think folks should lighten up on the $10 price thing.&nbsp; As some others here have said, you always pay more when SOMEONE ELSE is doing your cooking and serving and cleaning of dishes for you.&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp; Christina sounds like a cool person from her responses her, and I for one will make an effort to stop by when I&#039;m at that end of Ditmars (which unfortunately however is pretty rare, since I live way over by Steinway....)

				You could have let the thread die.<br /><br />Clearly there are some that feel the prices are too high. I think that&#039;s an acceptable opinion to voice.
