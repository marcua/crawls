				Hello, I&#039;m new to this site. I&#039;m a Queens native, but have only lived in Astoria for a few years and have yet to find a good doctor in the neighborhood. My experiences with Astoria doctors have not been catastrophic, but I can&#039;t say I&#039;ve left any of my appointments with a positive feeling and/or a desire to go back. Any recommendations in the Ditmars area or any other part of Astoria? Thanks.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I&#039;ve been to Dr. Singh, he was fine; but on my new plan, I see Dr. Marianna Joannow on 23rd Ave. in the Hippocrates Health Ctr. (?) building, b/w 26th &amp; 27th (I think.) I&#039;m forgetting the exact details!<br /><br />She&#039;s fond of writing Rxs which makes me wonder if it&#039;s due to kickbacks, but she IS thorough so maybe not. I don&#039;t use them all. Anyway, so far so good, plus it&#039;s nice having a woman who can relate to certain stuff.<br /><br />

				Do you mean Dr. Melanie Joannow? I went to her a couple times based on a friend&#039;s recommendation. Overall I thought she did a good job, but she would only write my prescriptions for one-to-two months at a time. Her receptionist wanted me to schedule routine appointments every two months. I found this absurd since I am a healthy adult in my mid-20s. I&#039;ve never had a doctor want to see me more than once a year. And the prescriptions weren&#039;t for anything new that needed to be monitored--the same allergy medications I&#039;ve been taking nearly my entire life. I figured it was just a way to make money from my health insurance.<br /><br />I also visited OBGYN Dr. Carlos Hleap with the Queens Long Island Medical Group (3175 23rd Street) for a routine checkup. (I found a recommendation for him on this board.) He was very nice, but he wanted to see me every 6 months rather than once a year. He said that is standard for his practice, but I&#039;ve never had an OBGYN ask me to visit more than once a year. But my main concern with him is his seeming ignorance of current birth control pills and birth control methods. He had never heard of Seasonale (or any of its other names/brands). And he could not understand why someone would want to use both birth control pills <em>and</em> condoms to prevent pregnancy. Is he not aware that neither method has a 100% success rate?<br /><br />Has anyone else had similar experiences? Does anyone know of decent MDs or OBGYNs that only want to see you if you&#039;re sick, are educated on current medications, and are willing to write prescriptions for more than a month at a time? I can&#039;t afford (financially or time-wise) to see each doctor/specialist every other month when I&#039;m not sick.

				kiwijill, I would say your experiences are definitely unusual. I&#039;ve never had a doctor request to see me more than once a year for healthy checkups. Keep looking for a good PCP, and when you find one have them recommend you to any other kinds of doctors you want to see.
