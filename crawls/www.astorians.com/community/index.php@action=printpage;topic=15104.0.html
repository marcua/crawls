				f you have been searching for a cool and unique apartment with laid-back roommates that are clean.......???? Well look no further, because here we are! <br /><br />We have room that just opened up in our apartment and we are looking for someone to move in between June 1st and June 15th! <br /><br />Rent is $800 a month and there is a deposit of $800. Our utilities/cable/wireless internet are split four ways which makes it pretty cheap! <br /><br />We have Showtime, Cinemax, and HBO.... and also all the free OnDemand Channels that go with them! So, if you are bored one night and the weather is bad or you simply want to veg out.... then you have at least 40 free movies to choose from! <br /><br />Our apartment is a renovated dentist office.... we don&#039;t have the chairs though... and none of us are dentists! But we did keep the sliding reception window, which has been a hit when we have had get togethers! <br /><br />The apartment has four bedrooms, but only three of them are used as bedrooms. The fourth bedroom we use as storage room for luggage, vacuum, ironing board, air conditioners (during the winter), etc. The extra room really helps out and gives us more space in our rooms! <br /><br />We also have kitchen (our landlord put a new stove and refrigerator in when we moved in), a living room, dining room, and a bathroom (that our landlord completely remodeled before we moved in)! <br /><br />In the kitchen we have several appliances, pots, pans, dishes, glasses, silverware, etc. I think the only thing we need is a new coffee maker... so if you have one of those you get extra points! <br /><br />And the shower in the bathroom has great water pressure... we have called it Niagara in the past! <br /><br />The room itself has four big windows. I know there are ads out there that say sunny room, and when you get there its small window facing a brick wall.... this is not the case! The room is 12.5’ x 9.5’ and has four large windows. The room has a walk-in closet in the hall way that is 5.9’ x 3.1’ and 8’ high. It’s great if you have things to store or have a lot of clothes! Again, we have lots of storage space!!! <br /><br />We are very laid-back and easy to get along.... and we are clean! We are looking for someone that is clean as well.... very important.... also that is a Non-smoker (one of the roommates is an opera singer and can&#039;t be around it). <br /><br />We have had one big get together last fall... and that was pumpkin carving contest! We took the pumpkins up to the roof after and lit them up on the ledge for the whole neighborhood to see! It was a lot of fun! <br /><br />If you are interested in seeing the room please send us an email telling us a little bit about yourself! We will then contact you and schedule a time for you to come by and view the apartment. <br /><br />
