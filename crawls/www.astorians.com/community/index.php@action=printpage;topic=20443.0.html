				I was walking down 24th ave when I noticed that Tokyo Japanese Restaurant had closed.<br />This was my go to restaurant for good affordable sushi, hopefully something else opens there that isn&#039;t a cell phone store or nail place.<br />

				That&#039;s a shame.&nbsp; We always enjoyed it when we ate in the restaurant.&nbsp; But it was a very bad location IMO.&nbsp; And our experience with delivery was very bad.&nbsp; And the whole staff was had a pretty poor grasp of English.&nbsp; Which is why it was important to be there in person.&nbsp; But very good food and very good prices.&nbsp; And very nice people who wanted you to enjoy your meal very much.

				I tried to order the other night and realized they were closed.&nbsp; I swear I ordered from them last month.<br /><br />Anyway, there&#039;s a sign in the window now that says it&#039;s going to be opening soon as Agave - Mexican Cuicine.

I&#039;m guessing that this is something different, hence the inclusion of &quot;Mexican Cuicine&quot; in the name to set it apart.

				There&#039;s always Watawa, best Japanese in the neighborhood in my opinion but Tokyo was pretty cute inside.

				Mexican place still hasn&#039;t opened.&nbsp; Never understood why anyone likes Watawa, despite giving it a try numerous times.&nbsp; Kitaku has great sushi, but it&#039;s expensive.&nbsp; AYCE Wednesday night is well worth it, though!

				It depends on what your concept of good sushi is. For some people, it&#039;s quality of fish. Other people like the variety and originality of the rolls and for others it&#039;s value. I like Watawa, but I only had the raw fish and not their amazing looking specialty rolls. I also like Sakura as they deliver.<br /><br /><br />They seem to be working on Agave very slowly. Maybe they are gutting the kitchen? I walk past every day and I&#039;ve only seen people in there maybe twice in the last three months.
