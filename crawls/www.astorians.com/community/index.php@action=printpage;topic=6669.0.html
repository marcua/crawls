				I&#039;ve always been surprised to learn which famous people grew up in Astoria.&nbsp; Here are a few off the top of my head.<br /><br />Whitey Ford, the former Yankee great pitcher who retired in the late 1960s.<br /><br />Singer Tony Bennett.<br /><br />Less famous<br /><br />Baseball player Henry Cotto, a journeyman who I believe played briefly for the Yankees.<br /><br />Film Society of Lincoln Center head Richard Pena<br /><br />In recent times (late 1980s maybe) Morton Downey Jr. was reportedly courting a woman who lived on 40th Street or 41st Street I think near Broadway.&nbsp; Supposedly, people saw him there with his limo.&nbsp; &nbsp;Downey has completely faded from the public eye, but back in the 1980s he was a Gerry Springer type talk show host and is the son of a noted Irish tenor, also named Morton Downey.<br /><br />I think Ron Artest, the psycho basketball player currently wearing out his welcome with the Sacramento Kings, grew up in the Queensbridge Houses.<br /><br />Tony &quot;Red&quot; Bruin, a Syracuse University star, and Vern Fleming, who had a long NBA career, both went to that private or maybe Catholic school whose name escape me.&nbsp; &nbsp;They attended in the 1980s.&nbsp; They were both high school All Americans and high school teammates.&nbsp; The school is near Ditmars Blvd. in the twenties.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t know if they grew up in Astoria, but they went to school here.<br /><br />Dito Montiel, who helmed the film A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints, grew up in Astoria, but until the movie came out I had never heard of him, though he reportedly was famous, or at least well known, before the movie came out.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				His brother, Glen Walken used to own a bar cafe on Broadway where the sushi joint is now.<br /><br />Ethel Merman, went to Bryant HS.<br /><br />My mom went&nbsp; to school with Tony Bennet, the old Art and Design HS. The cover of his CD Astoria features a photo of him&nbsp; as a boy in front of his home on 32 ST and 23 Ave. Inside is a self portrait he did of himself today in Astoria Park<br />with the Hellgate bridge.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				I don&#039;t know if Peter Vallone would be considered famous, but he was our councilman, or one of them anyway, and was Speaker or City Council President or whatever it was called.&nbsp; &nbsp;I always wondered how effectual he was because during his time in the limelight subway service on the N line was also dead last or near the bottom in those Straphanger surveys.&nbsp; &nbsp;Why he couldn&#039;t use his clout to get service improved I&#039;ll never know.<br /><br />Hack film director Joel Schumacher (one or two of the Batman movies are on his resume) is from Long Island city.<br /><br />In more recent times one of Mayor Bloomberg&#039;s commissioners lived in Astoria.&nbsp; I think she was of Indian descent and has since resigned and I think moved out of the country.

				Another famous Astoria or Long Island Citian is Julie Dash I think her name is and she made a splash in the early 90&#039;s with a film called Daughters in the Dust.&nbsp; &nbsp;She grew up in Queensbridge or the Ravenswood projects.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Melanie (Safka), folk singer.

Probably best known among some for her hit &quot;Brand New Key.&quot; Saw her at Stephen Talkhouse in Amagansett in the late 90&#039;s.&nbsp; She still has it!&nbsp; If you&#039;re a young person, have a listen. If she and Tony would only do a duet!<br /><br />Sportscaster Len Berman (&quot;And nobody got hurt!&quot;)<br /><br />Baseball player and manager Sam Mele.<br /><br />Ethel Merman, already mentioned in this forum, was born Zimmerman.<br />
