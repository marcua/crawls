				Anyone following some of the hotly contested US Senate and House seats across the Country?&nbsp; Up for guessing who wins what seats - what the new balance of the parties will be in the new Congress?&nbsp; What states Obama and McCain will win?<br /><br />What sites are people using to follow the election?&nbsp; I&#039;m partial to dailykos.com and mydd.com, but have found fivethirtyeight.com to be very useful as well.<br />

				I like fivethirtyeight, but it&#039;s pretty admittedly biased.<br /><br />I think the best site for non-partisan numbers is Princeton Election Consortium (http://election.princeton.edu/). They&#039;re pretty great and have interactive maps.

				<br />I know many who dont, but I like zogby polls and the zogby 50 state map. Though it was last updated late October.<br /><br />Not long ago, I thought the election would be very close. Still I think McCain fans will not be too disappointed.<br />My early prediction which seems it could be wrong is that<br />MO and NM would be very significant states. I was not expecting Obama to win so many swing states.<br /><br />I will still be surprised if Obama wins IN, NC, and VA.<br /><br />My hope after the election is that it will surprise how few Democrats will be in the administration. And there will still be a few moderates in the Senate with pull.<br />To be seen if Lieberman will still have his posts and part of the Dem caucus.<br /><br />At this time, I would say Obama 300+ electoral votes. Perhaps more than 60 M votes, and 50%+ of the popular vote. 50% might not sound like all that much, but would be significant for a Democrat especially Obama.<br /><br />

They were the first to use the process that fivethirtyeight is now more well known for: they take all of the polling data from across the country and rank and compare that information based upon how accurate the group doing the polling has been in the past and what methods they are currently using. It&#039;s amazingly accurate.<br /><br />One thing to remember when watching the electoral votes is that Obama will get a 77 electoral vote boost late in the night when the west coast comes in. CA, WA, OR &amp; HI will add that to his total. Obama only needs to get 200 from the east coast, midwest, southern and central states. With VA, PA and even OH swinging for Obama last week, he&#039;s going into the election with a lot of momentum.

				<br />I dont think it would be shocking if McCain wins VA and OH.<br />Will he win AZ for sure? I am again curious to see who will win NH.<br /><br /><br />200 is a good number to look for before the west coast polls close. Thanks.

				I think we&#039;ll have a good idea what is happening by 8 pm.<br /><br />I hear online that Arizona is close, but that seems hard to imagine.&nbsp; <br /><br />I was surprised to see all the pundits on the tv this weekend suggesting that Obama would get 300+ electoral votes, what an election that would be!
