				Yes, their site is where I got the $2550 for Pre-K, it&#039;s $3550 for K-8.&nbsp; However, it doesn&#039;t say anywhere on that site if that is a monthly or annual tuition.&nbsp; One I can afford, the other I cannot.

				I just checked one of my son&#039;s Prep Schools in Manhattan. Their annual tuition is now $33,900 and I&#039;m sure that still doesn&#039;t include books, labs or uniforms. It is stated in annual cost. I would call, but I am assuming it is an annual cost that MPB is quoting.

				The tuition is annual.&nbsp; My son is in the nursery program now.&nbsp; There are ALOT of fundraisers to try to keep the tuition low.

Non parish menbers pay about $1000 more per year.

				My children currently go there.&nbsp; (one in 4th &amp; one in K).&nbsp; The tuition that you mentioned is annual.&nbsp; As someone else quoted, there are tons of fundraisers through out the year to keep the tuition down.&nbsp; The fundraisers are not mandatory - you do what you can when you can.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also, as someone else mentioned it is a good idea to register with the parish at least a year before your child is ready to go to school.&nbsp; If you contribute to the parish church (with the envelope system) you do get a discount.&nbsp; Hope that helps!

				My son is there and it has been a very positive experience for him and us.&nbsp; Recommended even if you do not belong to the parish.&nbsp; Do not wait to look into the school or enroll.&nbsp; There is a limited number of openings, depending on the grade.
