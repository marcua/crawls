				I grew up in Astoria, and lived there until I got married in 1986 when I moved to Long Island, then Knoxville, TN. I will be coming back to NYC with my family this XMAS and want to take them to an authentic Greek restaurant in Astoria. I need a place that&#039;s got great food, not necessarily the fanciest, most expensive, trendiest, or touristy, just a good place to eat good food. What do you guys recommend?&nbsp; Thanks for the advice in advance.<br /><br />-Special Ed<br />For 27 years I called 41st and Ditmars Home!&nbsp;

				I second sandwichnyc&#039;s post. I went to Uncle George&#039;s for the first time on Saturday with some fellow Astorians. The food was delicious and inexpensive. There are some family style tables for larger groups of people and a large menu with daily specials. I also loved that they served wine by the kilo.&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				i&#039;ll third the Agnanti recommendation.<br /><br />haven&#039;t been there in a while, not fancy or expensive or trendy, but good food, good environment, nice people.&nbsp; i don&#039;t know anything about the owners or it&#039;s history, but has a real family/ community thing going on.

				Maybe the night I went to Agnanti was an aberration, but the service was terrible and the food wasn&#039;t that awesome.<br /><br />There were two walk outs that night and our waitress wouldnt make eye contact, didn&#039;t refill any empty glasses or replace bread, slamming food on our table and rushing off. The food wasn&#039;t that amazing either, although the appetizers were fine.<br /><br />I dunno, maybe I should try them again since they get such rave reviews...but I doubt I will.

				When were you at agnanti? I have noticed a bit of a decline in the service recently. They have never been quick to refill water or bread, but they were always super friendly. A lot of the familiar faces on the wait staff seem to be gone.<br /><br />However, I have never had a bad meal there, you should give it another try.

				Stamatis Restaurant<br />2912 23rd Ave<br />Astoria, NY 11105-2710<br />Phone: (718) 932-8596<br /><br /><br />This is the original Stamatis and it is authentic.&nbsp; My b/f is Greek and he says it&#039;s the closest thing to his mothers and grandmothers cooking.<br /><br />Here&#039;s an article from the Gazette:<br /><br />&quot;Restaurant<br />Of The Week <br />By Teresa Barile<br />Stamatis—30 Years Of Family Style Greek Food<br /><br /><br />For 30 years, the husband and wife team of Stamatis and Ann (no one knows them by their last name) have been serving up delicious, home-style Greek food in Astoria. There are two Stamatis Restaurants. The older one, which I visited, is located on 23rd Avenue, just off 31st. Street, and the newer location is on Broadway near 33rd Street. At either location you’ll dine in a very comfortable, casual atmosphere that welcomes friends, family and children. Stamatis and Ann greet customers at the door with a friendly smile and often chat with guests to make sure everything is to their liking.<br /><br />The 23rd Avenue location has a deceptively plain facade with a large window displaying the fresh fish of the day on ice. Inside, diners can view the specials, roasts and delicacies of the day prepared by the expert chefs. Just beyond the open kitchen, a lovely, spacious dining room is buzzing with life as friends and family convene to share a meal. Murals depict an Aegean village with garden and seaside scenes. In the summer, an outdoor patio allows for delightful al fresco dining.<br /><br />My favorite part of Greek cuisine is the wide variety of tempting appetizers, and Stamatis always prepares them well. Try an order of the grilled squid, tender yet toothsome in rich olive oil and lemon. The grilled octopus is just as good and both get a wonderful smoky flavor from the charcoal grill. Enjoy a plate of gigantic lima beans, slowly cooked for hours until their buttery flavor is released and enhanced by fresh dill and garlic. Of course, a sampling of dips is a must, including creamy, garlicky skordalia, a smooth potato dip which should be spread liberally on a piece of crispy garlic bread.<br /><br />For those who prefer, homemade soups include avgolemono, a chicken and lemon soup with orzo, hearty lentil soup or a soul-warming meatball soup, very popular with kids. A hunk of kefalograviera cheese, with its tangy flavor and wonderful texture is practically a meal in itself.<br /><br />Red and white wine is available by the glass or bottle. We were quite pleased with the carafe of house red that we shared, and it was reasonably priced at $8. The variety of entrees made our choice difficult. We remembered the succulent roast lamb that we saw in the front kitchen as well as the roast beef. Roast chicken that falls off the bone is another great choice. Stamatis’ delectable oven roasted lemon potatoes are a must, no matter what you order. I finally decided on the homemade moussaka, a rich, traditional casserole of seasoned ground beef layered with fresh eggplant and creamy bechamel sauce. It was great, and the generous portion provided me with lunch the next day. My dinner companion succumbed to the lamb and was amazed at how the incredibly tender, slow-roasted meat just melted in his mouth. Many entrees range between $10 and $16 and come with potatoes. We shared a side order of orta, sauteed dandelion greens, and polished off the wine.<br /><br />Other dishes, including tender baby lamb chops, veal chops and tiny quail, are also excellent and cooked to order. Stamatis features lots of fresh fish and shrimp each day. Porgy, red snapper and striped bass are marinated in lemon and olive oil and cooked whole over a charcoal grill to impart a delicious flavor to the flaky, white fish. What could be healthier than that?<br /><br />A dessert of sweet custard in flaky phyllo dough was the perfect ending to this meal. Bring your friends, your family and a big appetite when you visit Stamatis. Both locations are open for lunch and dinner, seven days a week and credit cards are accepted. The service is friendly and you&#039;ll always be greeted with a smile.&quot;<br /><br /><br />......I&#039;m hungry just reading it!!! LOL<br /><br />

				I&#039;ll second the Zenon Taverna.&nbsp; It&#039;s a Greek/Cypriot restaurant on 31st Ave b/t 34th and 35th Streets.&nbsp; Definitely try their Saganaki, it&#039;s indescribably good.

				speaking of greek, where does everyone go for a simple gyro?&nbsp; <br /><br />i&#039;ve been leaning towards zorba&#039;s lately (23th avenue and around 29th street..next to stamatis), but want to know of other places.&nbsp; when i lived in the 30th avenue area, i used to go to pinnochio&#039;s, which as i recall used to be pretty good.<br /><br />that gyro place on 35th and ditmars (gyro corner, i think, is the worst).

				For gyro I always loved Pamela&#039;s, on Steinway Street just north of 30th Avenue.&nbsp; Their gyro is made on the premises instead of getting the store-made kind, and their tsatsiki (yogurt) sauce is probably the best in Astoria.&nbsp; Romano&#039;s on Broadway and 33rd Street is also pretty good, as is Opa on 31st Street between 30th Avenue and Newtown Ave.&nbsp; BZ Grill on Astoria Blvd. and 27th (?) Street is also great and is the only one of the above that also has doner kebab (like gyro but with actual chunks of meat, which is what one would get if they ordered a gyro if they were in Greece).<br /><br />

				I personally wouldn&#039;t recommend Pizza Palace for a couple of reasons: 1) the gyros are the factory-made variety, which lack in taste and freshness compared to establishments which make their own gyro (there&#039;s several such places in Astoria).&nbsp; Also, 2), Pizza Palace, for some reason, is absurdly overpriced on most items, not just gyro, in my opinion.&nbsp; Easily 50 cents to a couple of dollars more for the same dish found elsewhere, even a few blocks away.

				I&#039;m not so bothered by what they choose to carry on their menu. Just the deceptiveness of owners or internet search providers making anon posts about their restaurants like &quot;Hey, flabbodies.com is a great restaurant. You should try it.&quot; and pass it off like an actual customer wrote it. It smacks of amateurishness. I&#039;d rather see owners honestly chat up their business and persuading people to go. :x

				the last time i went to pinnochio&#039;s (for gyros, anyway), it was pretty decent.&nbsp; <br /><br />i remember when they first opened in their original location, and it was spectacular then, but that was eons ago.

				Unfortunately my choice for the 2 best greek restaurants are now closed, Karyatis on Broadway &amp; Esperides on 30th Avenue.<br /><br />Still a good choice though is <em>Tony&#039;s Opa Souvlaki</em> on 31st Street, Between 30th Avenue and Newtown Avenue, good food, decent prices.<br /><br />

				If you love fish, try Elias for Fish - on 31st Street under the &quot;el&quot; N train.&nbsp; Can&#039;t remember the avenue, but it&#039;s across the street from the beer garden.&nbsp; The front of the restaurant has ice cases filled with whole fish, you pick it and they grill it.&nbsp; They also have great thin crispy potatoes and in summer you can sit outside on an elevated patio - it&#039;s lovely!
