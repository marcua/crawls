				So, American Idol is back as of tonight and got me to thinking.&nbsp; Why do I watch this blaring example of the wasteland that is &quot;American culture&quot;?&nbsp; I&#39;m a professional musician with a degree in music performance.&nbsp; What is it about this show that keeps bringing me back year after year to watch this mind-numbing epitome of mediocrity?&nbsp; The only thing I can conclude is that it&#39;s like watching a train wreck.&nbsp; Utterly disturbed but can&#39;t avert my eyes due out of morbid curiosity.&nbsp; Watching the hordes of misguided wannabes who never had the benefit of someone telling them they have little or no talent.&nbsp; And the worst part of this show is what happens to good singers.&nbsp; Seeing singers that truly have potential being molded into consumer products by having any ounce of individual identity sucked dry.&nbsp; The songs they choose and are forced to sing reduce them to just another sound-alike crappy pop singer.&nbsp; In the long run, it seams that it would be beneficial to NOT win the show so you aren&#39;t pigeon holed into singing the worst example of bubble gum, over the top, ultra overly dramatic crap these assembly-line song factories can come up with.<br /><br />And to touch on the absolute no talent ego cases...<br />How do these people get through their entire lives without a single person telling them they can&#39;t sing?&nbsp; And how can they be so tone deaf that they don&#39;t know they suck?&nbsp; And how can they get upset when someone is finally willing to tell them the truth?&nbsp; Do we now live in a society that is so overly protective of people&#39;s feelings that we can&#39;t tell them they aren&#39;t good at something?&nbsp; It&#39;s good to have goals.&nbsp; But some goals are just not realistic.&nbsp; Sometimes it&#39;s best to not patronize someone and give them false hope because the fall can be hard for those that are unprepared to hear the truth.<br /><br />Hahaha.&nbsp; A girl just sang, &quot;If I were king of the forest&quot; and thinks she should get a shot because she&#39;s &quot;unique.&quot;&nbsp; Poor stupid child.<br /><br />What ever happened to hard work?&nbsp; As other musicians on this board can attest to, talent isn&#39;t a &quot;gift&quot; in most cases.&nbsp; It takes hard work and dedication.&nbsp; This is a point lost on most of these singers.&nbsp; Practice is what makes a musician great.&nbsp; Not by being &quot;unique.&quot;&nbsp; Uniqueness comes naturally and isn&#39;t something that is conciously achieved.<br /><br />OK.&nbsp; Enough for now.&nbsp; Happy new season of American Idol!!! :evil:<br /><br />

				I tend to think the American Idol tryouts are a complete joke.&nbsp; I really think that there are people who audition as a joke, just to see themselves look the fool on tv.&nbsp; Some of these breakdown crying swearing sessions are so fake.&nbsp; I mean, I&#39;ve been watching 15 minutes of it so far, and there have been no good singers.&nbsp; The auditions are for the most part, a joke full of horrible singers.&nbsp; It&#39;s annoying.&nbsp; I like to hear people with good voices sing, not horrible kareoke.<br /><br />That being said, I am not ashamed to admit I really enjoy Kelly Clarkson.&nbsp; She seems to be the one gem to come out of that factory.<br /><br />I&#39;m surprised though that Jewel would want to be a guest judge.&nbsp; Why, Jewel, why?&nbsp; Don&#39;t you have better things to do with your time?

				Honestly, that juggler dude was so fake to me.&nbsp; It all seemed like such an act to me.&nbsp; Fake swearing, overexaggerated yelling, the crying was really retarded (he even covered his face so you didn&#39;t see the tears), I just didn&#39;t believe him at all.&nbsp; I think he went on there as a joke.&nbsp; It just didn&#39;t seem like a genuine disappointment/crying session to me.&nbsp; Even the audition wasn&#39;t genuine.&nbsp; His heart wasn&#39;t in it, and everything about it seemed an act to upset the judges.<br /><br />And Jewel, I&#39;ve always liked her.&nbsp; But she&#39;s disappointing me, same way other big idols in my life have.&nbsp; Madonna and Prince among them. Oh well.

				I think it&#39;s awesome how Jennifer Hudson benefitted from American Idol.&nbsp; There&#39;s a good chance that she wouldn&#39;t have been given the opportunities she&#39;s had if it hadn&#39;t been for her exposure on American Idol.&nbsp; She is a wonderful actress and singer and I am so happy to see her well-deserved success!&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#39;ve been known to watch American Idol from time to time.&nbsp; I used to think it was crap (and some of it surely is), but I&#39;ve relaxed about it.&nbsp; It can be fun!&nbsp; Towards the end especially, you can hear some amazing voices, despite the voice&#39;s pop packaging.&nbsp; <br /><br />&quot;I want to be famous&quot; has kinda been around for a looooong time.&nbsp; It&#39;s nothing new.&nbsp; American Idol is just a new vehicle for people to attempt to reach their dreams, which is valid, even if we don&#39;t think they are any good. And what&#39;s wrong with wanting to be famous?&nbsp; (unless you try to attain fame like John Wayne Gacy or something.)<br /><br />I&#39;d rather watch American Idol than football!&nbsp; :D

				Oh yeah, how could I forget Jennifer Hudson?&nbsp; She&#39;s awesome and has an amazing voice.&nbsp; And she&#39;s a great actress, completely deserving of her award.<br /><br />It seems that the auditions are just a time for the world to laugh at a bunch of people acting like they can&#39;t sing.&nbsp; They weed out those time wasters, and the poor souls who aren&#39;t acting, and end up with a precious few who have some potential.

				That is indeed disturbing. It bothers me that so many people think that the best they could achieve is being famous and/or rich. I wonder what&#39;s brought about this value shift. I have a few ideas, but no research to back it up, so I&#39;ll just sit back and see where the conversation goes.

				That could be a part of it - though it could also be that myspace and reality tv reflect our desire for our 15 minutes of fame. Sort of a chicken/egg thing. <br /><br />I do think that this shift happened before Myspace, etc. Before either of those came about my music teachers were complaining about students who cared less about music for its own sake and more about just being famous.

				In another 20 years, after American Idol dies out, another will be there to take its place.&nbsp; I remember &quot;Star Search&quot; and &quot;The Gong Show&quot;.&nbsp; They remind me a little of American Idol, although perhaps a little more gentler.<br /><br />I believe that it is possible to be rich/famous and have a meaningful philosophy of life.&nbsp; I don&#39;t think you have to trade one for another.&nbsp; Also, the people that were surveyed for the UCLA study are college freshmen, which is age 18.&nbsp; I&#39;d be much more interested to see how they develop their philosophy after 4 years of college and through their 20s.&nbsp; I know for me, my ideas and philosophy about living took some time to come into focus. <br /><br />And anyway, on American Idol, we only see a sliver of any of the participant&#39;s life.&nbsp; I don&#39;t think I can figure out their life by watching them do one audition.&nbsp; It&#39;s so easy to sit back and say &quot;you suck&quot; from the comfort of one&#39;s own living room.

According to a new book, &quot;Fame Junkies&quot; by Jake Halpern, 43.4 percent of teenage girls said their No. 1 career goal was celebrity assistantjust being close enough to smell the red carpet has become its own reward. &quot;Anybody can be famous now,&quot; says Paula Abdul. &quot;It&#39;s like a disease.&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The book mentioned in that quote seems to be right on target, so I googled the author.  Here (http://www.jakehalpern.com/news.html) is his website, and here (http://www.jakehalpern.com/journalism/TextStories/famePT.html) is an excerpt of the book for an article in Psychology Today.  The whole article is interesting, but these two paragraphs stood out:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">What explains the fact that so many American teenagers are so hungry for recognition, fame, and adulation? Oddly enough, part of the blame lies with American educators, who have been embracing self-esteem-building programs since the early 1970s. One popular program, called Magic Circle, requires one child a day to be given a badge that says i&#39;m great. The other children then take turns praising the great child and eventually, these compliments are written up and given to the child for posterity. Programs like this were intended to make young people feel better about themselves, but many educators now concede that they may have overshot the mark and fostered a culture of narcissism among American youth.<br /><br />According to psychologist Keith Campbell at the University of Georgia , American teenagers exhibit much higher levels of narcissism and entitlement than older Americans and teenagers from other parts of the world. Campbell fears that in Americawith TV talent shows like America Idol and celebrity parades such as Entertainment Tonight making fame seem readily availableteenagers&#39; sense of entitlement and narcissism will grow and fester. Adolescents everywhere may have delusions of grandeur, but in America these fantasies don&#39;t seem so farfetched. The problem is that teenagers are encouraged to adopt the self-centered mindset of prima donnasconstantly looking to be admiredbecause they believe their own fame is imminent.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I find it interesting that he traces the genesis of this to the early 1970s.&nbsp; That fits in with enigmacat&#39;s observations that it&#39;s been going on longer than MySpace et al. -- which makes sense, of course; American Idol itself is older than MySpace and YouTube!&nbsp; I definitely intend to take a closer look at his book, as well as his research.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=4756.msg48491.html#msg48491">Quote from: megc on January 17, 2007, 12:36:12 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Also, the people that were surveyed for the UCLA study are college freshmen, which is age 18.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes, but they&#39;re comparing like with like.&nbsp; 18 year olds in 1967 had far different aspirations than 18 year olds in 2005.&nbsp; That is significant and does not require looking at their responses to similar questions when they are older.&nbsp; And while I don&#39;t necessarily disagree with you that it&#39;s possible to be rich and famous and have a meaningful philosophy of life at the same time, I think the whole point of this whole thread and the various links demonstrate that many people either don&#39;t care or don&#39;t think the issue through enough.&nbsp; The issue here isn&#39;t what you think or what I think, it&#39;s what young Americans think.<br /><br />My reference to all of this has nothing to do with individual performances and the easy ability to say &quot;you suck&quot; from the comfort of my living room, btw.&nbsp; I&#39;m taking a broader view of this issue than that.

				This thread has actually gone in the direction I had anticipated.&nbsp; I&#39;m not so interested in the actual show as I am the underlying subjects we&#39;ve been discussing.&nbsp; And I&#39;m also trying to relate some of my own personal experience as a musician to it.&nbsp; For example, I have no false hope of fame or wealth, or even the notion of making a living playing music.&nbsp; I do it because I love it.&nbsp; I don&#39;t feel as though I&#39;m entitled to anything aside from what I&#39;ve worked for.&nbsp; And I&#39;ll fight tooth and nail to get gigs and perform, and meet new musicians, and network, etc...&nbsp; But I don&#39;t expect, or anticipate anyone will magically give me all these things.&nbsp; It&#39;s my responsibility.&nbsp; And what I see with this show, is a general sense of entitlement from most, but certainly not all, of the contestants.&nbsp; For example, there was a girl on last night with a really nice, big voice.&nbsp; She was a crack baby, and had a tough upbringing.&nbsp; She was just glad to be given the opportunity, and didn&#39;t expect to necessarily go through.&nbsp; I&#39;ll be rooting for her.&nbsp; But I find she is the exception to the rule with the contestants, and with a lot of the youth I see around NYC.&nbsp; I agree that Myspace and other social networking sites are a symptom, and not the cause.<br /><br />My overall point in this particular post, is that a sense of entitlement is BS.&nbsp; And most of the kids that have a sense of entitlement need to be slapped silly and given a solid dose of reality.&nbsp; Life ain&#39;t easy, and you don&#39;t always get what you think you want or deserve.&nbsp; Instead of treating kids with kid gloves and trying too hard to protect their feelings, perhaps we should go back to teaching that life isn&#39;t always easy.&nbsp; Sometimes it sucks.&nbsp; And maybe, just maybe, you aren&#39;t going to be famous.&nbsp; So what are you going to do now that your fame is nonexistent?&nbsp; And while opportunities are given from other people, it&#39;s our own work that determines whether those people give us an opportunity.

				Speaking of great musicians and fame, I saw Nancy Wilson perform on TV yesterday.&nbsp; What a wonderful voice!&nbsp; Was great to hear her.&nbsp; I am sure she worked very hard to be where she is today.&nbsp; She&#39;s famous for what she does.&nbsp; And has a wonderful take on life and love.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />No matter what you want in life, for most of us, it takes hard work.&nbsp; It&#39;s interesting where life takes us, though.&nbsp; Life is full of surprises!

				At the advice of a friend, I tried watching &quot;American Idol&quot; in the second season. I watched the first or second episode. Two things bothered me. One was the people who were going on these auditions and were clearly pulling the leg of the producers. People were faking a belief in actual talent just to get on TV. It seemed to me that they knew they were horrible, they were consciously trying to be even more horrible and they were looking to get famous by being horrible.<br /><br />But while I watched audition after audition, something else bothered me that I couldn&#39;t quite put my finger on. Then a very stylishly dressed pretty blonde gave a thoroughly bland performance of Stevie Wonder&#39;s &quot;Superstition&quot;. Did she have a better voice than me? Yes. She even added some of those popular vocal trills meant to approximate emotion in so many songs these days. The judges, of course,&nbsp; loved her! One even complemented her on the &quot;cool boots&quot; she was wearing. That&#39;s when I realized what the second thing that was bothering me was. We don&#39;t need to be looking for another stylishly dressed pop tart simulating emotion to sing Stevie Wonder. We need to be looking for the next Stevie Wonder! So I turned the show off and haven&#39;t watched it since. <br /><br />P.S. And yeah, seriously, what the hell is up with Jewel?

				What Jtrane says makes me think of a story on NPR about a middle eastern woman (didn&#39;t catch the country - came in at the middle of the show) who was in a horrible marriage but did not leave because making a decision based on her own needs rather than the needs of her family and community was completely at odds with her worldview.

				Enigmacat wins for mentioning Ayn Rand.&nbsp; Haven&#39;t heard her name mentioned in any relevant way in years.&nbsp; Good call. This thread has me thinking about whats in store for the next generation and their young expectations/ Or perhaps there will be a culture crash and things will get back to more traditional (hate to use the word) values (not in the Bush Evangelical sense).<br /><br />I think Jewel has been selling out big time for a while now and has been showing up more in main stream TV.&nbsp; Perhaps she is there to take over when Paula&#39;s head implodes.<br /><br />What was up with the girl who put the cowardly lion growl in everything, that was crazy.

				I think our sense of what stability means has upgraded, too. I mean, my parents have their own house (small but adequate) and they are both working outside the home at this point. They worry about money and they are indeed financially behind their peers - but to someone in a 3rd world country they would be considered not only stable but quite rich. <br /><br />I took a vow not to buy anything new this month - just to see if I could do it. And I have - the only new things I have bought, other than food, have been health-related. I find it interesting that we measure our country&#39;s wealth not by how much people are saving, but how much they are spending.<br /><br />I think disposable income has become part of the stability equation. Not only do we need to be able to buy a house (in a desireable location), but we also need to fill it with clothes and electronics and fashionable furniture.

				So, I have no excuse, I watched again, and I was just saddened. A young man 27, went on and sang unchained melody, and clearly had Asperger&#39;s syndrome. Given the disorder, he responded pretty well to the criticism. I&#39;m not sure if the judges picked up on it, but they didn&#39;t let up on the criticism, which I guess is only fair...and the last comment &quot;what a strange guy&quot;...just had to comment on it...now I really mean it, I&#39;m not going to watch it again...really.

				At the risk of being politically incorrect.....<br /><br />I like American Idol. <br /><br />Some of you may miss the point and that it is 3 different shows, each distinct in its own way.<br /><br />First, are the Audition Shows. These are there for comedy. To take these shows seriously is like doing an indepth social analysis of the 3 Stooges. The Stooges are funny slapstick comedy. Woody Allen once said something about what a waste it is to analyze and dissect comedy and how its a waste of time. Either you dig the stooges or you don&#39;t. Some people like South Park :evil: &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Second are the elimination round shows. These are drama shows where one can look at potential talent and see backstage workshops and molding of talent and personalities. If you like to see talented people persue their dreams and what it takes to conquer their fears,<br />this show can be compelling<br /><br />Lastly there is the talent competition, where truly talented unknown can go from diamonds in the rough to shining stars. Kelly Clarkson, Jennifer Hudson, Paris Bennet, Carrie Underwood, and so many others grew into popular singers.<br /><br />Is pop music for everyone? No some are classical purists, some are jazz aficianados and never listen to anything else.<br /><br /><br />American Idol at its best also does contribute 2 things to our culture today IMHO.<br /><br />In the Finals they have theme shows, one of which is Broadway.<br />Last year I watched and said to myself this is like a live Broadcast of a Broadway Show. Kathy Mcphee performing was so reminiscent of see Kristen Cheniworth on Broadway. There are a lot of people in Kansas or the like who have no access or exposure to live Broadway, and many people, families and children got some exposure to a cultural experience they would not have otherwise.<br /><br /><br />Second, AI is the one family type of show that all the family can and does watch together. Mom, Dad the kids and even Grandma actively watch and share their opinions and ideas and interact together. &nbsp;If there&#39;s something out there that help Granny and the kids get together on, &nbsp;it can;t be all bad. &nbsp;

				Okay..no shame...<br /><br />I do find it interesting though, given that Time Magazine a few years back did an article on Geek syndrome and how due to microsoft having its headquarters in seattle, you are having a lot of children born of &quot;high-tech&quot; parents propogating a &quot;geek syndrome&quot; which is actually Aspergers....looking at american idol today, apparently these guys showed up for American Idol....it is striking how many individuals that REALLY appear to have a disability have been trying out, but I counted at least four thast meet criteria for Aspergers...I mean hey, good for them..no criticism here...but interesting none-the-less...<br />Nice to see no one is discriminating though...honestly.

				Me, too. I watch it, but usually not these audition shows. I get embarrassed for both the judges and those poor misguided kids who really think they have talent.<br /><br />But, tonight I got a call from a friend who works with the production staff on the show. He knows how addicted to Freddy Mercury and Queen I was, and he told me that someone was going to be auditioning with Bohemian Rhapsody. What he didn&#39;t tell me, however, was that that piece of tape was to be the last audition of this 2 hour airing.<br /><br />When I hear Ryan Seacrest announce, before a break, that we were going to be treated to the Bohemian Crapsody, I fell off the sofa laughing. OMG. I don&#39;t think this guy was staged. I think he was delusional.

				I&#39;ve watched American Idol every season since it came out, and I find no shame in that. I&#39;m a singer and was a voice major in college, along with being well educated in various facets of music, but I find the show entertaining and enjoy watching the competition as it progresses. I like hearing the same singers sing different genres every week.. that&#39;s actually my favorite part of the show, the variety as it goes along. Some very talented singers have gotten their names out there because of the show, and I think that&#39;s a good thing in a country where you can only hope to be heard by the masses if you&#39;re signed to a major label. I don&#39;t like the crap music the winners have to sing either, but Kelly Clarkson&#39;s come a long way since she won and has actually come out with some very listenable stuff, albeit strictly pop/rock. <br /><br />Most people seem to like these early auditions more than the rest of the show, but I don&#39;t like the early stuff. Mainly I don&#39;t like that they focus on so many awful singers who are clearly just trying to get their 15 minutes of fame by being the worst singer/personality imaginable. But I also don&#39;t like this new thing that they seem to be doing more and more: they play a sob story about the person who&#39;s auditioning, like that it&#39;s a someone from a really poor family who&#39;s saved up just to go to this audition and it would mean so much for them to make it through, or someone who was teased throughout their childhood and is trying to prove everyone wrong.. etc.. and so you&#39;re rooting for this person and expect them to sound good, and then they sing and they&#39;re just horribly, horribly bad. <br /><br />Why does the show choose to shame people like this on national television? They&#39;re not arrogant, or nasty, or otherwise annoying and therefore deserving of national mockery. They&#39;re nice people who&#39;ve had some serious problems and are genuinely trying to do something to improve their lives a little. I&#39;m not saying that auditioning for American Idol is a great way to improve your life, but it would be nice if the producers of the show would grow a conscience and pick their losers a little more thoughtfully. I mean, at the very least, they could just show the auditions without playing the life story. I have no problem believing that someone who&#39;s tone deaf doesn&#39;t know how bad a singer they really are. I&#39;m just confused as to why none of their friends or family would warn them not to audition if they didn&#39;t want to make fools of themselves. It&#39;s one thing if they&#39;re auditioning for the show secretly, but for the ones with parental support I just don&#39;t get it.<br /><br />That kind of brings me to my next point. A lot of people have been talking about a sense of entitlement. The convenience of our society has lead a lot of people to think that things should just be handed to them without their having to work for them, and the seemingly ever increasing focus on children&#39;s self-esteem creates people that think they&#39;re great and special regardless of how good at anything they actually are, realistically. Society doesn&#39;t preach humility and respect; it preaches &quot;you&quot; and &quot;me&quot; and how we can do things to benefit ourselves. And being a rock star seems, to the general public, to be a great way to benefit one&#39;s self.<br /><br />But people need to learn and accept when they&#39;re just not good at things. Parents are afraid to discourage their children by telling them they&#39;re bad at something. Some will even lash out at teachers when their child receives a bad grade or doesn&#39;t make it into an honors course.

Mainly I don&#39;t like that they focus on so many awful singers who are clearly just trying to get their 15 minutes of fame by being the worst singer/personality imaginable. But I also don&#39;t like this new thing that they seem to be doing more and more: they play a sob story about the person who&#39;s auditioning, like that it&#39;s a someone from a really poor family who&#39;s saved up just to go to this audition and it would mean so much for them to make it through, or someone who was teased throughout their childhood and is trying to prove everyone wrong.. etc.. and so you&#39;re rooting for this person and expect them to sound good, and then they sing and they&#39;re just horribly, horribly bad. <br /><br />Why does the show choose to shame people like this on national television? They&#39;re not arrogant, or nasty, or otherwise annoying and therefore deserving of national mockery. They&#39;re nice people who&#39;ve had some serious problems and are genuinely trying to do something to improve their lives a little. I&#39;m not saying that auditioning for American Idol is a great way to improve your life, but it would be nice if the producers of the show would grow a conscience and pick their losers a little more thoughtfully. I mean, at the very least, they could just show the auditions without playing the life story. I have no problem believing that someone who&#39;s tone deaf doesn&#39;t know how bad a singer they really are. I&#39;m just confused as to why none of their friends or family would warn them not to audition if they didn&#39;t want to make fools of themselves. It&#39;s one thing if they&#39;re auditioning for the show secretly, but for the ones with parental support I just don&#39;t get it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well, this show has been on for, what, 6 seasons now.&nbsp; It&#39;s not like it&#39;s unexpected that the bad singers are going to be ridiculed.&nbsp; If you can&#39;t stand the heat, stay out of the kitchen.&nbsp; Sure, the first season I could have understood this viewpoint.&nbsp; But now, these people deserve what they get, as it&#39;s common knowledge that if you suck, you&#39;re going to get called out.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=4756.msg48629.html#msg48629">Quote from: essen on January 18, 2007, 01:50:09 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />That kind of brings me to my next point. A lot of people have been talking about a sense of entitlement. The convenience of our society has lead a lot of people to think that things should just be handed to them without their having to work for them, and the seemingly ever increasing focus on children&#39;s self-esteem creates people that think they&#39;re great and special regardless of how good at anything they actually are, realistically. Society doesn&#39;t preach humility and respect; it preaches &quot;you&quot; and &quot;me&quot; and how we can do things to benefit ourselves. And being a rock star seems, to the general public, to be a great way to benefit one&#39;s self.<br /><br />But people need to learn and accept when they&#39;re just not good at things. Parents are afraid to discourage their children by telling them they&#39;re bad at something. Some will even lash out at teachers when their child receives a bad grade or doesn&#39;t make it into an honors course.

				I don&#39;t think that we as a society are afraid. I think it&#39;s that the people who are there for moral support/teaching aren&#39;t being frank. Or maybe it&#39;s that when the teacher says &#39;you haven&#39;t got it&#39;, the kid or their parents find another teacher. Could also indicate a lack of knowledge about what makes a good singer.<br /><br />I know musicians from my parents&#39; and grandparents&#39; generations who have only the most minimal talent. But they didn&#39;t want to &quot;make it.&quot; They wanted to play/sing for their family, at community gatherings, and at church. It brought them a lot of joy and they clearly believed they were good musicians, but never thought of trying for the big time and never thought of making their living with music. Musicianship was just a part of who they were, being successful as a human being was a bigger picture. <br /><br />I am an adequate choral singer - nothing more - but I have had people tell me I could &quot;make it&quot;, and they meant it (keep in mind this was in rural oklahoma). I&#39;ve been around enough truly talented singers to just smile and say thank you and laugh internally when I hear that stuff, but someone who was really invested in being the next rock star might surround themselves with people who truly don&#39;t know any better.

				Something else that all of this made me think about is the recent trend of &quot;prosperity spirituality&quot; in evangelical christianity. Oral Roberts definitely comes to mind, and there are of course many evangelical leaders who teach their congregations that God wants them to be wealthy, and that success and wealth are signs of god&#39;s favor. Money is not considered the &quot;root of all evil&quot; - it&#39;s a blessing from god. I am oversimplifying a bit but this could easily be its own discussion.<br /><br />Are we confusing financial success and fame with spirituality and meaning?<br /><br />The problem with fame and wealth is that there&#39;s only so much to go around. Not everyone can get there.

I would assume, given the format of the audition shows that the criteria to get through is being either really good, or really bad, with a few mediocre people sprinkled in. It also seems to me that they make a lot of the bad/mediocre people go first so that they can say things like, &quot;It seems like they&#39;re not having any luck finding people for Hollywood here in Austin,&quot; and then have a few amazing people come through. I&#39;m one of those jerks that usually only watches the audition shows and then gets bored with the rest of it, but I couldn&#39;t get into it this year - I watched maybe 30 minutes total this week.

				Yup, I had a roommate who auditioned a few years ago which is how I found out that the first couple rounds of auditions have nothing to do with Simon, Randy, or Paula. She didn&#39;t make it past the first round. I found this article about it from this season&#39;s auditions which sheds some light on what happens there: http://www.accesshollywood.com/news/ah1162.shtml<br /><br />Here&#39;s a quote of the relevant part:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The auditions finally got under way around 10:30am and according to some folks I interviewed afterwards only about 6 people made it through of the first 100 or so auditioners. The judges during this first round of auditions consisted of American Idol producers and staffers. Fourteen tables are set up and the auditioners line up in groups of four at each table. They are then asked to say their name and sing a song. If the producers like what they see then they get through, if they don&#39;t then they are told &quot;not today.&quot; I spoke to a bunch of the kids who didn&#39;t make the cut and each and every person had the same comments. Basically, they all question the validity of the show and what they are looking for in someone. I asked a bunch of them to sing for me and truthfully most of them were pretty good, no worse or better then the five or so people I spoke to who made it through. Let&#39;s face it; this show is more about casting an interesting group of people than it is about true talent. If they picked 24 superstar singers for the final rounds, the show would be boring. As she was walking out one woman who had been rejected remarked, &quot;I should have come dressed in a chicken suit, I would have had a better shot!&quot; I didn&#39;t see anyone in a chicken suit but I did see a guy dressed like Uncle Fester. He didn&#39;t make it through. However, a woman wearing a prom dress and a tiara did make the cut. She and the probably several hundred or so that did make it through the first audition will have to fight their way through two more rounds (the first is on September 23rd in Los Angeles) before they go before the big guns.. Simon, Randy and Paula.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Questioning the validity of American Idol auditions seems kind of silly. I mean it&#39;s American Idol, they can choose whoever the heck they want to breed into a pop star.

				True, they weren&#39;t able to judge the situations fully. But I go back and forth on this...to truly treat these individuals fairly and equally, do they have the right to be ridiculed on American Idol just like everyone else? I laughed at some of the contestants that did not have optimal presentation. Is it treating them fairly to NOT laugh just because of the disability? I don&#39;t know...still thinking about it. But to be fully included in society, they probably should have the right to be exposed to a variety of situations, not just optimal ones.<br /><br />However, I doubt this reasoning was the impetus behind the producers selection...it was probably to ridicule...don&#39;t have that much faith in people.

				However, understanding the show, you know that is going to happen. It isn&#39;t a secret that they humiliate people and yet people still go. I don&#39;t think that producers can be held responsible for putting someone on the show that may have a mental disorder (11% of the world population has some type of disability or mental disorder, so there goes 11% of their contestants) <br /><br />However, knowingly putting someone on that clearly has a disability is a different story, someone that may not understand what they might be in for.

I mean, you would have to prove that the same percentage of the mentally disodered and non-mentally disordered populations try out for american idol. And not all mental disorders would harm someone&#39;s decision-making abilities to the same extent or in the same way. I wouldn&#39;t be as worried about someone who was bipolar as I would for someone with a very low I.Q. IANAS, but I don&#39;t think all mental disorders can be lumped together in the same way. And even if they did lose 11% of their contestants, they would still have plenty more. <br /><br />Having typed all that I think we were saying essentially the same thing. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=4756.msg51807#msg51807">Quote from: Alexa on February 01, 2007, 11:57:32 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">But to be fully included in society, they probably should have the right to be exposed to a variety of situations, not just optimal ones.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That&#39;s not really enough for me.

				If 11% of the population has some type of identified diagnosis (which is an actual statistic), then at any given moment, (for example if you are in a room of ten people, one of you has something going on) that is the percentage. Sure, you may have a truncated sample where you will not get a distribution like that of the general pop, but randomly assigned that is what you would get.<br /><br />I&#39;m not trying to prove anything about the contestants...If I could hazzard a guess, I would say they have MORE going on than your average grouping of people (just an observation from the show). <br /><br />That being said, if you know what you are in for, then I don&#39;t have much pity. It is the guys that may have no understanding I feel for. And they also may not understand that they are being ridiculed.

				Got to agree with Jtrane there. Also no one can be humilaited, unless they humiliate themselves. They all know what they&#39;re getting into. Btw - have you ever watched the gong show ? It&#39;s not like there was never a precedent for this. <br /><br />The self styled Doctors here who seem to be remotely diagnosing medical symptoms without ever having met the person I don&#39;t understand either. If they are correct in their analysis of the situation - are they suggesting that AI discriminate against the handicapped ?<br /><br />The critics who feel that people are being exploited by getting TV exposure for no real reason or talent would have a much stonger arguement against Jerry Springer, Maury and the like. At least AI main goal is to lead to a talent contest for wiining recording contracts, not explotation for it&#39;s own sake. &nbsp; &nbsp;

				The Fox Family Made for TV Movie proudly presents:&nbsp; <strong>George&#39;s Lesson</strong>, staring Jason Schwimmer, Sally Fields and Dan Castellana.<br /><br />George yearned to be a singer.&nbsp; His voice had a deep resonance which exuded an erotic masculinity.&nbsp; During childhood, while he battled the ravages of mental retardation, his parents, encouraged his singing, hoping it would give him a foundation for recovery.&nbsp; The tears which slipped out of his grandmother&#39;s eyes while he sang &quot;happy birthday&quot; to her on her last year on earth would become a permanent piece of heart wrenching family lore.<br /><br />As George grew, he could not socially keep up with the other kids his age.&nbsp; He did mainstream, but he was teased constantly in school, especially after being caught singing &quot;I Feel Pretty&quot; in the school bathroom.&nbsp; Though his talent was obvious to anyone, he began to feel the weight of an unflinching world that demanded perfection.&nbsp; He was rebuffed in his attempts to join the choir, music teachers would ignore him, and even his dad gently told him to &quot;forget his singing and get a job at the A&amp;P&quot;<br /><br />But George kept at it.&nbsp; He went to music producer after music producer.&nbsp; Some were harsher than others, but their messages were the same:&nbsp; &quot;You&#39;re good kid, but you&#39;ll be laughed at.&quot;&nbsp; No matter how well he sung, no one wanted to listen.&nbsp; The next few years would sow a nadir only the aisles of the A&amp;P would ever fully understand.&nbsp; Only his mop would hear his mellifluous chimes.<br /><br />Fate would find him on a long line one September morning with his always supportive mother.&nbsp; She couldn’t bear to see her son suffering and she waited all night with him so he could audition on American Idol.&nbsp; Though barely able to stand up straight and hampered by the steady stream of mucus which slipped down to his mouth and was thereupon spit out onto all but the most dexterous of passer byers, his version of “Girls Just Want to Have Fun” flabbergasted the producers.&nbsp; The stone cold silence which followed his last notes was broken a moment later by the thunderous ovation by those who were trying to escape his stead only a few minutes before.&nbsp; But the world doesn’t always operate on merit and after a few minutes of conferring, the producers shook their heads and turned him down.<br /><br />His mother called up the very next day and asked why he wasn’t given a chance.&nbsp; She was hung up on several times.&nbsp; She finally got through to talking with one junior producer, who told her that due to a legal decision which the show’s lawyers made due to a strident posting in Astorians.com, people of his handicap were not permitted on the show.&nbsp; He should try Jerry Springer instead.<br /><br />But George had one thing on his side.&nbsp; Laura, a big wig at the network, was in the bathroom reading the articles of Playgirl when she heard George’s voice through the ventilation ducts.&nbsp; She connected the smooth butter like voice with the strapping square jawed men in the magazine and fell in love.&nbsp; The memo she wrote to the producers was curt and precise: “Either he’s in, or you’re out”.<br /><br />The rest is history.&nbsp; George’s winning of the American Idol contest, his marriage to Laura and his eventual ascendancy to the Presidency of the United States of America.&nbsp; America had learned a lesson she would hopefully never forget.
