Sripraphai in Woodside is the number one restaurant for Thai food and Trattoria L&#39;Incontro in Astoria is the number three restaurant for Italian food, according to the 2007 New York City Zagat Survey. And for the first time, a Queens street food vendor has edged out the Manhattan competition.<br /><br />The Zagat Survey has been a standard for excellence in dining since Tim and Nina Zagat established it in 1979. They believed compiling the personal experiences of thousands of restaurant customers was more accurate in rating a restaurant than a review by any one person. Today, more than 250,000 people contribute ratings in over 70 cities worldwide.<br /><br />The two Queens restaurants, Sripraphai and Trattoria L&#39;Incontro, were also among the top 40 restaurants in New York City, an impressive standing, given the number and quality of food establishments in the city and the discerning palates of its denizens. Sripraphai is located at 64-13 39th Ave. and Trattoria L&#39;Incontro is at 21-76 31st St.<br /><br />Meanwhile, New York City&#39;s best street food vendor, Samiul Haque Noor, serves grilled chicken and lamb from his cart, Sammy&#39;s Halal, at 73rd Street and Broadway in Jackson Heights. Noor was one of two finalists from Queens and the ultimate winner among 200 nominees at the second annual Vendy awards, making Queens &quot;arguably the city&#39;s capital of street food,&quot; according to an October 25 New York Times report.<br /><br />The first Zagat guide was a survey made exclusively for New York City. In addition to restaurants, Zagat guides also rate travel, shopping and recreation. Questionnaires are posted on Zagat&#39;s Web site, where consumers can continuously give their ratings and reviews. The published guides are based on the results of the questionnaires pegged to a 30-point scale.<br /><br />Also receiving high Zagat scores were Piccola Venezia, Agnanti and Taverna Kyclades, all in Astoria. according to an October 19 report in the New York Daily News.<br /><br />&quot;Astoria has become a veritable &#39;Restaurant Row&#39;-home to hundreds of exquisite restaurants, intimate cafes, quaint coffee shops, and other eating emporiums. Astoria is a whole world of dining in one neighborhood,&quot; a brochure entitled &quot;Dine Astoria&quot; by the Central Astoria Local Development Coalition, states.<br /><br />Indeed, Agnanti (19-06 Ditmars Blvd.), Taverna Kyclades (33-07 Ditmars Blvd.) and Piccola Venezia (42-01 28th Ave.) are surrounded by numerous other food places included in the 2007 Zagat Survey.<br /><br />They are: Amici Amore (29-35 Newtown Ave.), Ammos (20-30 Steinway St.), Brick Café (30-95 33rd St.), Café Bar (32-90 36th St.), Cavo (42-18 31st Ave.), Christos Steak House (41-08 23rd Ave.), Demetris (32-11 Broadway), Elias Corner (24-02 31st St.), Emack &amp; Bolio&#39;s (21-50 31st St.), Le Sans Souci (44-09 Broadway) , Malagueta (25-35 36th Ave.), Omonia Café (32-20 Broadway), Ploes (33-04 Broadway), Ponticello (46-11 Broadway), Sac&#39;s Place (25-41 Broadway), S&#39;Agapo (34-21 34th Ave.), 718 (35-01 Ditmars Blvd.), Stamatis (31-14 Broadway), Telly&#39;s Taverna (28-13 23rd Ave.), Thai Pavilion (37-10 30th Ave.) and Ubol&#39;s Kitchen (24-42 Steinway St.).<br /><br />In addition, these Astoria food places were cited in a November 3, 2004 New York Times article: Butcher Bros. Steakhouse (29-33 Newtown Ave.), Cup Diner and Bar (35-01 36th St.), Fatty&#39;s Café (25-01 Ditmars Blvd.), Go Wasabi No. 1 (34-02 30th Ave.), Go Wasabi No. 2 (29-11 Ditmars Blvd.), J.J.&#39;s Fusion Kitchen and Sushi Bar (37-05 31st Ave.) and Uncle George&#39;s Tavern (33-19 Broadway).<br /><br />Over the 27-year history of the Zagat Survey, poor service is the most frequently made complaint (63 percent) while complaints about food and prices amount to only about 20 percent. Zagat Survey columns appeared in the Gazette for more than two years.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				So what do we think the Manhattan/Queens differential for the Zagat ratings is?&nbsp; I&#39;m not talking about places that are particularly popular with foodies (e.g., Sriphraphai, to which people from the city regularly flock - a 27 or whatever for that place seems to be reasonable relative to the Thai offerings of Manhattan).&nbsp; What I&#39;m suggesting is that, regarding Italian food for instance, or maybe even Greek (!), a few points need to be subtracted on the Queens end in order to bring the ratings into line with Manhattan ratings so that an accurate comparison can actually be made.&nbsp; I would attribute the skewing&nbsp; of the ratings to the democratic nature of the Zagat Survey- let&#39;s face it, there are just a lot more foodies in Manhattan.<br /><br />discuss amongst yourselves.

				I blogged about this issue (http://somethinktochewon.blogspot.com/2006/10/restaurant-recommendations.html) a little. Why is there any reason to expect <em>my</em> particular views of restaurants reflect the <em>average</em> of hundreds of people I don&#39;t know, half of whom probably like liver ((http://www.radioparadise.com/graphics/smiles/icon_puke.gif)) and the other half of whom find German food too spicy ((http://www.radioparadise.com/graphics/smiles/eusa_wall.gif)). Zagat seems to think that their aggregate ratings tell me what I need to know, and that&#39;s ridiculous. <br /><br />This said, Zagat is sitting on a goldmine. Because of their huge number of reviewers, they know the correlations between peoples&#39; views of different restaurants. They should be able to do the same sort of thing Netflix and Amazon do, tell me what restaurants <em>people like me</em> like! It drives me freakin&#39; crazy that they don&#39;t use this data. <br /><br />Also, there are pretty standard statistical techniques to deal with the sampling bias of UES people reviewing mostly UES restaurants and people from Queens reviewing mostly Queens restaurants, to make the averages more comparable. I see no evidence that the Zagat number-crunchers know a mean from a median, much less how to fix these sampling issues. They should freakin&#39; hire me.<br /><br />(I was hugely disappointed by Trattoria L&#39;Incontro, FWIW. For a restaurant of that purported caliber, it should not be possible to order the &quot;wrong thing.&quot; I went to Paprika, an Italian place in the E. Village last night with Victorine/Rachel and a friend of hers. That place also does fairly standard Italian fare, and it nails every dish every time. As far as I&#39;m concerned, go there instead.)<br />
