				Post by: <strong>mcdirk</strong> on <strong>June 23, 2008, 11:54:55 AM</strong>

			<dd class="postbody">
				Just wanted to spark a discussion about petitioning and how it works, what people know about it and think about it.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been petitioning for political candidates for 15 years and it&#039;s oftentimes laborious, but can be fun.&nbsp; Under NYS law, candidates have to gather valid signatures of voters registered in the party in whose primary they wish to run in order to qualify for the ballot - this includes incumbents, so you see people out on the street and walking building to building with long green sheets, usually on clipboards.&nbsp; As there are periodically challenges to petitions, and you have to have enough valid signatures (it varies by what office is being sought) in order to qualify, candidates usually gather two to three times the required number of valid signatures.&nbsp; It&#039;s really arcane, signatures can be invalidated for any number of reasons.&nbsp; While some folks stand at grocery stores and try to get anyone to sign, the best petitioning is done door-to-door, with a list of registered voters for your party.&nbsp; I cover three to four election districts each cycle - this time carrying sheets for the Queens Democratic Slate (two judges, Congressmember Carolyn Maloney, State Senator George Onorato, Assemblymember Michael Gianaris, and all our party officials).&nbsp; The page has to be folded in half to fit on a clipboard and even then it&#039;s too big.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s really an interesting experience - you ring the doorbell, ask for the registered voter and see if you can get them to sign.&nbsp; Signing the petition only helps the candidates qualify for the ballot, it does not obligate you to support the candidate or vote for them.&nbsp; You might, if the campaign is organized, get a thank you note from the candidate, but that&#039;s increasingly rare.&nbsp; <br /><br />I find the responses really interesting - some folks have lived in NYC for a long time and have seen petitioning every electoral cycle and sign immediately, and get other voters in their household to come to the door, which is nice.&nbsp; Some like to talk, which is refreshing and often fascinating - I&#039;ve met really great folks petitioning.&nbsp; Others are very suspicious and have no idea why you are there and some refuse to sign, some politely, others in a brusque manner.&nbsp; I found it really unusual yesterday how few folks had any idea of who their elected officials were - usually everyone knows Carolyn Maloney, some know George Onorato and an increasing number know Mike Gianaris, but I had at least 10 people who had not heard of any of them, though they read local newspapers and get all the franked mailings/reports from elected officials.&nbsp; It was just unnerving.&nbsp; One mad told me he wanted to google them all to see if they were really holding office.<br /><br />Just wanted to see if folks had seen petitioners out on the street - what their reaction had been, if folks had been visited at home by people gathering signatures and spark some discussion.

				Sorta tangential, but I pass by petition-collectors on the street frequently, and almost always ignore them. As a matter of personal policy, I sign very few petitions, except for those for ballot access. Every other petition seems to me to be a waste of time. When&#039;s the last time a &quot;save the whales/Tibetans/civil rights&quot; petition made any difference whatsoever? (I support all three, incidentally.)<br />

				Harlan - I believe that was what McDirk was referring too. BTW I agree about the other &quot;cause petitions&quot; as a waste of time.<br /><br />Last year a woman in Arab/Muslim dress asked me to sign some petition and I replied Yes If she will sign mine to stop Islamic oppression of women. Well she was very stunned that I could ask such a thing while she had no qualms about asking strangers ti sign for her cause,

				yep, I was/am talking about nominating petitions for the upcoming elections.&nbsp; I tend to sign a lot of the non-election related petitions, but I don&#039;t know that they achieve much unless they&#039;re targeting a specific local purpose to show community support.&nbsp; I fear that signing them gets me more junk mail, in general, though nominating petitions do not generally get you more mail - they get filed with the board of elections (sometimes organized campaigns send out a thank you note for signing, though I&#039;ve never seen this happen in Queens).

The whole process has been quite a learning experience and still is. I also imagine that it is very different for Dems in NYC and for the GOP outside of the metros.

That said, you find some voters are really engaged. And most are quite understanding of wanting to have a choice of candidates on the ballot.<br /><br />However, after the 2000 election results, it was suprising how much hostility there was to having choices other than a Dem or GOP on the ballot.

				I was&nbsp; doing it&nbsp; this week, for&nbsp; Thomas Dooley, running against&nbsp; Onorato, try&nbsp; being a Republican in NYC and getting&nbsp; a petition signed?&nbsp; :-P You want to talk about people&nbsp; getting nasty.&nbsp; :-D&nbsp; Truth is&nbsp; many folks&nbsp; act as if they are &#039;gung ho&#039; for&nbsp; any side, but, when it comes&nbsp; to the hard work of&nbsp; signing petitions, you have&nbsp; to be committed.

				and it&#039;s petitioning season again, but at least the weather is nicer this year, though it always seems that the people who are in are on the top floors of buildings, never on the first floor (drat!).<br /><br />Folks seem less inclined to do anything political this year - my refusal rate is much higher than I&#039;ve ever seen before - it&#039;s sad to see people check out of the process.<br /><br />Anyone seeing petitioners out and about?&nbsp; Have any petition-folks come to your door?

				LMAO.....I was reading through the thread and kept wondering why McDirk was petitioning for Onorato. It wasn&#039;t until I got to FZ&#039;s post that I realized the original thread was 2008.&nbsp; :x<br /><br />Anyway, my partner and I was stopped by JFP petitioners on 30th Ave by the subway and we both signed it. <br /><br />If we get stopped by an AS petitioner, can we sign that one too?

				My favorite part of petitioning is seeing how many Republicans there are in the neighborhood&nbsp; :-D<br /><br /><br />It usually goes like this:<br /><br /><strong>Petitioner:</strong> Excuse me, sir.&nbsp; Are you a registered Democrat?<br /><br /><strong>Guy trying his best to avoid petitioner:</strong> No, I&#039;m a Republican.<br /><br /><br /><br />If only another party actually had those kinds of numbers in the city...<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>Of course, my favorite answer is:</strong> I don&#039;t have time right now.&nbsp; [walks away and then stops in front of a store to stare at purses for a couple of minutes]&nbsp; :x<br /><br /><br /><br />
