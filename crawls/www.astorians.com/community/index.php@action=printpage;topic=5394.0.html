				I dined at Walima last night - it is Moroccan and at the corner of Forty Deuce and 31st Ave - and had a wonderful meal.&nbsp; Although there is no alcohol the fresh and fluffy bread that arrived when we were seated more than made up for my craving for wine.&nbsp; We started with a falafel appetizer - four generous fried cigars of tasty chick pea and parsley that came with a rich and creamy white sauce that tasted of tahini and was addictive.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had better falafel (these were more parsley-esque than I prefer) but that sauce did the trick.<br /><br />I had the Koufta and my companion had Fes Chicken.&nbsp; The Koufta were six very well seasoned and perfectly cooked meatballs of ground beef (not shaped like meatballs but more like little loaves).&nbsp; They arrived with a perfectly cooked and seasoned mix of shoestring carrots and zucchini, along with a fragrant yellow rice - again perfectly cooked.<br /><br />The Fes Chicken was two generous pieces of chicken (on the bone) over a huge platter of couscous (some chick peas along the edge for show).&nbsp; The chicken was tender and moist and covered with a sweet oniony sauce.&nbsp; Perhaps made of raisins - I didn&#039;t ask because I was too busy moaning from the pleasure of all these flavors in my mouth.<br /><br />The service was friendly and attentive.&nbsp; The wait person for our table heard my companion sneeze from across the room and brought him some extra napkins as he had no tissue.&nbsp; Now that&#039;s attention.<br /><br />The prices are fair for the amount and quality of food IMHO. They deliver.

				This is where we had our December group dinner last year. No BYOB unfortunately because they are observant. The portions are huge, the flavoring salt or no salt will vary from dish to dish, but it is a great local place to visit when you don&#039;t feel like cooking. Because they&#039;re never crowded the service is always good. I really like the vegetarian couscous there and the chickpea soup-really good.

				I just saw that article in the Village Voice earlier today!!! I really want to go there!!!! Is it the kind of place where you can go by yourself and not feel wierd? I usually end up going out alone...having a mixer there would be great though!

				My wife and I went to this place on Friday night after seeing the review in the Village Voice, and we had a great experience.&nbsp; &nbsp;Had Couscous with Veggies as well as with Chicken, and both were wonderful.&nbsp; The couscous in each dish was light, fluffy and very flavorful.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Also Walima is BYOB and there was no corkage fee!&nbsp; &nbsp;:mrgreen:

				It was my understanding that previously they did not allow people to bring their own alcohol in because they did not want alcohol in the restaurant (regardless of whether they actually served it).&nbsp; Has this changed?

				I went to Walima last night with my boyfriend. It was probably the best Moroccan food that I&#039;ve had in the city, not just Astoria. We ordered the mint tea, seafood briwats (I didn&#039;t have any but my boyfriend LOVED them) the chicken tagine and the chicken pastilla. The tagine was delicious and so was the pastilla. <br /><br />I really, really, really recommend this place (really). We went around 6ish last night and it was very quiet. I&#039;d really love to see a bigger crowd there, they deserve it with that food! <br /><br />My boyfriend is from Casablanca so I&#039;ve had my fair share of Moroccan food, and so has he of course. . .We both agree it was the best we had in NYC. <br /><br />Please go!!!! I&#039;m already planning my next trip.

				walima is on my blockk and i&#039;ve been meaning to try it for months. we braved the cold tonight and didn&#039;t regret it. for appetizer we had the zaakout (grilled eggplant, sun dried tomato dip), and for entrees we had the beef tagine and fes couscous. both entrees were very authentic and delicious. beef tagine was especially tender. beautiful decor and nice ambiance too. <br /><br />fyi - their liquor license is pending, and in the meantime they are doing BYOB.

				I went to Walima last night with a party of four, and we all LOVED the place!&nbsp; I have to thank Astorians.com for turning me on to Walima - I hadn&#039;t been aware of it until reading about it on here.<br /><br />What a comfortable, welcoming place - they were incredibly nice, just great service.&nbsp; But it was all about the incredible food - we all had the Harira (dee-licious soup), I had the veggie couscous (yum), my table-mates had the chicken tagine (boy, he was just moaning with pleasure), the seafood bastilla and the chicken bastilla (they too were really, really happy).<br /><br />Also - the Morrocan mint tea, sweet and addictive.<br /><br />I have to say I enjoyed the accolades coming my way for suggesting the place, all based on these messages I&#039;d read on this board...
