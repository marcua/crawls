				This isn&#039;t really an Astoria specific question as it is a NYC apartment question, but what&#039;s up with places that charge an application fee of, say, $300? Does anyone actually pay this? I can&#039;t imagine paying that much when you don&#039;t even know if you&#039;ve got the apartment yet. One place we thought of applying to had an application fee of $100, and even that seemed like too much.<br /><br />I&#039;ve seen this occasionally in Craigslist ads, like this: http://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/abo/1006163332.html<br />Is it a scam or is this a real thing that people do?

				I believe there is an application fee on some places where there is no broker fee, and someone wants to make a little money and still say there is no broker fee.&nbsp; The thing about an application fee is that you are paying to APPLY, so that sounds like you don&#039;t get it back if they give the apartment to someone else.&nbsp; Much like applying to college, I guess you are paying for someone to read your application. <br /><br />The apartment that I live in now had a $20 application fee (and it had to be cash only).&nbsp; No broker fee.&nbsp; It&#039;s owned by a management company, and they advertised on Craigslist, I met with the Super to see the apt, and gave him my $20 and application.&nbsp; I was wary about the application fee thing--I probably would have not bothered to apply had the super not told me he was going to recommend that I get the apt.&nbsp; He had a giant stack of applications, all with the required $20 in cash.&nbsp; I have no idea where all those other application fees went.&nbsp; In this case, it was only $20, though.&nbsp; $300 seems excessive if you&#039;re not guaranteed you will get the apartment.

				Is there also a fee for credit check? $20 seems reasonable but $300 seems way out there.

				I can see a desire to get only serious applicants, but $300 is really steep. I looked at one place that had a $40 application fee, and another that had a $5 credit check fee, but I wouldn&#039;t pay anything like $300. No way.

				ha, well the post was removed. Maybe that sort of thing is always a scam. I can definitely understand application fees of $20-30 or something, but anything above $50 strikes me as ridiculous.
