				<br />August 26th, September 13th, 14th and 15th: It&#039;s Your Waterfront!<br />Public Listening Sessions along the LIC and Astoria Waterfront<br /><br />Astoria Residents Will Discuss the Waterfront with Green Shores NYC and the Trust for Public Land.<br /><br />ASTORIA/LONG ISLAND CITY, N.Y â€“ Green Shores NYC and the Trust for Public Land will sponsor their next Listening Session on Wednesday August 26th from 6:30 PM to 8:00 PM at the Greater Astoria Historical Society, 35-20 Broadway 4th Floor in Astoria, Queens. The meeting is free and open to all.<br /><br />&nbsp;This focus of this session will be the full stretch of shoreline from Bowery Bay in the north to Gantry State Plaza at the south of Queens. Three more listening sessions, each one concerned with a different section of the Astoria-Long Island City Waterfront, are being held this summer. Those dates are:<br /><br />September 13th: Ravenswood @ Variety Boys and Girls Club, 21-12 30th Road, Astoria 6:30 PM to 8:00 PM<br /><br />September 14th: Hunters Point @ St. Mary&#039;s Church Basement, 10-09 49th Ave, Long Island City 6:30 PM to 8:00 PM<br /><br />September 15th: Astoria Park @ Bohemian Hall, 29-19 24th Ave Astoria, NY<br />6:30 PM to 8:00 PM<br /><br />After a brief introduction, participants will break into small groups and use oversized maps of the area to point out specific spots they want to discuss. Attendees will use colored stickers to mark the places they think are working well or not working well. Afterwards, each breakout group will summarize its opinions for the larger meeting.<br /><br />These Listening Sessions are the first phase of a waterfront vision plan being produced by Green Shores NYC and the Trust for Public Land with the assistance of urban planners from Jonathan Rose Companies. In the fall, two community wide meetings will discuss specific issues and ideas. These ideas will lead to a vision plan--published as a handout and available online-- summarizing the community&#039;s recommendations.<br /><br />Green Shores NYC is an all-volunteer non-profit community group that works to enliven the Astoria and Long Island City waterfront. We organize educational and recreational events in the parks and advocate for parks and public spaces that are clean, safe and easily accessible.<br /><br />The Trust for Public Land is a national, nonprofit, land conservation organization that conserves land for people to enjoy as parks, historic sites, and other natural places, ensuring livable communities for generations to come. The New York City office, among other accomplishments, has created playgrounds out of vacant lots, including one at Astoria&#039;s Judge Charles Vallone School.<br /><br />Any Questions?
