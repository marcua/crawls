								<div class="inner" id="msg_148756">COMPASSIONATE AND INTUITIVE LICENSED PHYSICAL THERAPIST WHO INTEGRATES MASSAGE AND YOGA TO PROMOTE HEALTH <br /><br />Often I am told that I give an amazing massage. I say this with complete humility and I feel very privileged and honored to hear this each time. Perhaps it is a combination of several factors: 1) I have spent time pursuing higher education in many different forms, in a quest to understand the human body, particularly, but definitely not limited to, the musculoskeletal system. Of course, this is an ongoing journey, one that I enjoy thoroughly and I know is life long. 2) I have diverse experience working on all types of bodies - young, old, athletic, physically challenged, etc. Through my experience I have come to understand that no matter what body you are blessed with, it is all just a covering for the soul, which is innately beautiful, pure and divine. And that is exactly how I treat others. 3) I have a high level of empathy and compassion due to my life challenges and experiences. 4) I have a very intuitive and heart-centered nature and I strive to see people on a level other than the physical level.<br /><br />My goal is to have you float out of our session feeling a sense of lightness, freedom and overall wellbeing! <br /><br /><br />Hi. Thank you so much for taking the time to look at my ad. I am a licensed Doctor of Physical Therapy (NYU graduate), as well as a massage therapist and certified yoga teacher. I work with a diverse population and I am comfortable with all ages ranging from children to those of advanced age. I have training and experience in providing care to individuals with various physical and medical challenges, including but not limited to, those with neurological diseases such as cerebral palsy, ALS, stroke, as well as individuals challenged with cancer, heart disease, post-surgery, etc. I also work with athletes, performing artists, &quot;healthy individuals,&quot; etc. and I provide wellness sessions for those who are interested in relieving stress or maintaining their health through massage and/or or learning an exercise program based on physical therapy and yoga principles. I believe that regular massage, in addition to a healthy lifestyle, can help to keep you functioning at your optimal level. This is a place where you are liberated of pain and excessive tension and you are free to pursue your passions, dreams and enjoy the relationships in your life. <br /><br />I am constantly seeking out new knowledge to enhance my skills in the form of seminars, workshops and new learning experiences, so that I can provide a unique, high quality session tailored to the needs of each and every individual client. Presently, I am pursuing a certificate program in Yoga therapy. <br /><br />I am a very heart-centered and intuitive individual and listen attentively to the person I am working with – with all of my senses. I believe in adapting to the individual, rather than following a specific recipe, and this will be reflected in our interaction together. Using my knowledge of physical therapy, massage and yoga, I seek to collaborate with the individual I am working with to design a session that will promote a natural state of health and wellness. <br /><br />I am available for private sessions – massage, physical therapy, yoga – or a combination of all of these. &nbsp;Thank you again for your interest. I look forward to the privilege of being an instrument of peace and healing for you in the near future. <br /><br />You can contact me directly at <a href="mailto:mhgdpt@yahoo.com" class="bbc_email">mhgdpt@yahoo.com</a> for more information regarding scheduling a session. Please introduce yourself in the e-mail telling me a bit about yourself &nbsp;(a picture is always appreciated) and your general needs in a massage (e.g, chronic or acute injuries, areas of stress or tension, etc.), &nbsp;Below is some background on the work I am currently involved in. &nbsp;If you have the time, please read on.<br /><br />I have dedicated my time to working with individuals with special needs. Currently, I work full-time in a school for children with multiple handicaps in the South Bronx. The children are ages 9-21. I see children individually throughout the day in which I have the opportunity to combine my various skills and tailor therapy sessions for the specific child. In 2002, I initiated a yoga program at the school, which began with four children with mild to moderate cerebral palsy. Today, more than half the students in the school (there are approximately 600 students in total) are attending yoga classes each week. I myself teach three yoga classes each week with 30-45 children of varying physical abilities in attendance at each class. In addition, I have trained more than 300 therapists and teachers within the New York City Department of Education (as well as others) in how to implement yoga in their therapy sessions or classrooms. This year I implemented a weekly massage clinic in the school in which children with mild to very severe neurological disorders (e.g., cerebral palsy, spina bifida, Down’s syndrome, etc) receive massage. This has been a great success and very popular among the students. I believe this is a population that truly needs massage and unfortunately is largely underserved. Many health professionals do not feel comfortable or have the proper training to safely work with individuals with neurological disorders or medical challenges and these are the individuals who need bodywork the most! I am so blessed and honored to be involved in all of the work I am doing and it is truly very gratifying. In addition to my work at the school, I do private sessions with children and adults with neurological and orthopedic disorders – or wellness visits! <br /><br /><br />Wising you health, love and happiness and the inner guidance to choose the avenues that will promote this.<br /><br />Please contact me directly at <a href="mailto:mhgdpt@yahoo.com" class="bbc_email">mhgdpt@yahoo.com</a> if I can be of service to you.<br /><br /><br />********************************************************************************************************* <br />THIS IS STRICTLY PROFESSIONAL MASSAGE<br /></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_148803">Yoga Wonderland is a non-profit organization. The organization&#039;s mission is to bring yoga to children of ALL backgrounds and abilities so they can feel empowered and shine their lights brightly. By exposing our children to this ancient and spiritual practice, we are promoting balance and equanimity in our kids and encouraging them to follow their heart&#039;s desire or life path, without the need to compete or measure their self worth against others accomplishments. They will come to know that there is room for all of us to succeed and be prosperous in this world and that we are all connected.&nbsp; All of our actions in life have consequences and we cannot hurt another (this includes our fellow human beings, animals and our Earth) without hurting ourselves.&nbsp; This leads to adults who are tolerant and compassionate and contribute to strong communities and eventually world peace. <br /><br />I AM AVAILABLE TO TEACH GROUP OR PRIVATE CHILDREN&#039;S YOGA CLASSES IN ASTORIA, QUEENS AND ALL OVER NEW YORK CITY. <br /><br />Hi. My name is Martha. I am a licensed physical therapist/massage therapist and certified yoga teacher.&nbsp; I have diverse experience in teaching yoga to children of ALL abilities and an immense passion for sharing yoga with children. The classes I teach are based on traditional yoga guidelines, including practical techniques to teach breathing, asanas (yoga postures), meditation and relaxation. The sessions are imaginative, fun, and include exciting warm-up exercises and yoga sequences choreographed to music. Your child will leave each class feeling refreshed, relaxed, positive and happy, with new knowledge and skills to face the challenges of life. <br /><br />Currently, I am working as a pediatric physical therapist in a New York City public school, with children who have multiple handicaps, in the South Bronx. Many of the children I work with have cerebral palsy, impairments secondary to stroke, Down&#039;s Syndrome, spina bifida, mental retardation, autism, and other neurological diseases. The children range in age from 9-21. We have approximately 600 children in our school, with about 300 children who are wheelchair dependent. Our physical therapy department consists of approximately 25 occupational and physical therapists. In addition to providing physical therapy for the children, I implemented a yoga program more than five years ago. The yoga program I began is a great success and I lead several large group classes each week with as many as 40 children with physical, mental and emotional handicaps in attendance. I have trained several therapists at my school to teach their own yoga classes. Today, the majority of the therapists at the school are involved in some way with the yoga program and the teachers and Principal have been very supportive. The popularity of the program has grown immensely. The program started with five girls with mild to moderate cerebral palsy doing yoga and has grown to this. The children really adore the classes and can&#039;t get enough of yoga. I have found my life purpose and I can&#039;t get enough of sharing yoga with them. <br /><br />The word yoga means union of the body, mind and soul. Unfortunately, in Western society, yoga has become associated with picture perfect bodies in various physical poses that are beyond the capabilities or even safety limits of the average person, let alone individuals facing physical challenges. That is not what yoga is or was intended to be when it originated more than 5,000 years ago. Yes, physical exercise is one component and we do have a lot of fun with it in our class. But there is also a spiritual aspect that we incorporate as well. For example, at the end of every class we sing the &quot;Namaste Song.&quot;&nbsp; One translation of the word Namaste is “the light inside of me honors and bows to the light inside of you.”&nbsp; By singing this song at the close of every class and then sharing the hand gesture of Namaste (two palms together in front of your heart) with others in our circle, we are reinforcing our connectedness and respect for one another.&nbsp; Imagine our world today if we all had this sense of honor and reverence for one another, knowing with our whole beings that we are not separate, regardless of our perceived differences.&nbsp; I can&#039;t think of a better lesson to teach our kids, can you?<br /><br />In addition, to teaching yoga classes to children (with and without physical disabilities), I provide trainings to therapists, teachers, parents, and other like-minded individuals on how to teach children of all abilities yoga. In fact, I played a major part in creating a workshop entitled Yoga for All: Finding the Ability in Disability. This workshop was presented to approximately 200 physical and occupational therapists within the Department of Education two years ago. As a result of this workshop, several yoga programs started in District 75 schools (special education schools) throughout the five boroughs. Because of the overwhelming positive feedback, I decided to make it available to interested individuals outside of the schools. I am so excited about this because as a yoga practitioner, as well as NYU graduate with a Doctorate in physical therapy and a Kripalu Certified Yoga Teacher who has taken several certification courses to teach children yoga, I know the benefits of yoga. I have witnessed the amazing physical, mental and emotional changes in myself, as well as in the children I have worked with over the past five&nbsp; years, since I have implemented the yoga program. What’s more is that they can&#039;t wait to do yoga and many say it is the highlight of their week. One beautiful 14-year-old boy I work with named David is challenged with spastic quadriplegia cerebral palsy. He is very bright and sensitive. He has a beautiful aura about him and a smile that can brighten anyone&#039;s day, but often he falls into a depression because he is all too aware of his limitations. He constantly tells his mother, &quot;its not fair that I can&#039;t walk and my brother can.&quot; Well his mother told me that David talks about yoga class all of the time and how much he loves it. She said that David said to her, &quot;yoga class is the only thing that takes my mind off of not walking.&quot; Talk about bringing tears to my eyes and touching my heart. No amount of money could inspire me to work harder at what I am doing than that one statement. <br /><br />I have been very blessed by the generosity and support of so many individuals. I received a donation of 700 yoga mats (500 from Gaim and 200 from a small company) to start up yoga programs within New York City public schools for children with special needs five years ago. In addition, I have received donations of CD&#039;s from spiritual artists and children&#039;s artists and other valuable donations, including visits to our school from respected individuals in the &quot;yoga world.&quot; I do not get any funding for my program. I personally finance the program for various supplies and props and depend a lot on donations from the yoga community, as well as fundraisers organized by myself and the therapists involved.&nbsp; I was also the recipient of a scholarship from Kripalu Center for Yoga and Health in Lenox, MA, to become a Certified Kripalu Yoga Teacher.&nbsp; Last year I received a full scholarship and I recently completed an intensive year-long training to become a certified Structural Yoga Therapist. This training taught me how to structure a yoga program for a specific individual, according to their unique body and challenges. So many others have contributed to this miracle and I am truly grateful for the love and support that I have been finding everywhere I go. The Universe has definitely been providing and making it clear that I am on the right path.&nbsp; If you are in a position to make any donations that will benefit the Yoga Wonderland programs, please do get in touch.&nbsp; We are always in need of yoga mats and other supplies and would be very grateful for any support you can offer.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />I am routinely taking continuing education courses to enhance my skills and keep my teaching fresh and imaginative, as well as looking for music and activities to inspire and motivate the children in yoga class. I put a lot of thought into coming up with creative and fun activities, usually choreographed to music, because I have found this is what children of ALL abilities really respond to and this is how they are fully engaged. I believe that if a child is having fun, laughing and smiling, they are truly in the present moment, and this is the true essence of yoga. This is the best environment for learning. In addition, many of the disabled children I work with do not have a social life like other children do. They do not have the opportunity to engage in group sports with other kids. So this class is their rare chance to be with their peers and simply have fun. They really feel that they are part of a community and they so proudly tell their family and others &quot;I do yoga.&quot;&nbsp; In addition, this class allows children with disabilities to interact with &quot;able-bodied&quot; children.&nbsp; Both learn enormous lessons, such as compassion, patience and team work.&nbsp; It quickly becomes clear to them that their differences aren&#039;t as great as their similarities.&nbsp; <br /><br />My intention is to open up an after school yoga program called Yoga Wonderland.&nbsp; This program will be for kids of all abilities.&nbsp; I want to open up this studio in Astoria, Queens.&nbsp; If anyone knows about an affordable space to start out, as well as funding opportunities for a project like this in Astoria, Queens, or any other advice/resources, I would be very grateful.&nbsp; I know this would be a very valuable resource for our community but I am somewhat perplexed about how I can truly make it happen.&nbsp; While I feel natural in the position of teaching kids yoga, the business aspect of opening a studio is an unfamiliar challenge.&nbsp; So any help or direction from my fellow Astorians would be very much appreciated!<br /><br />Eventually, I would like to see this program spread to several inner city neighborhoods. I have been blessed to work with so many amazing children from the inner cities, ranging in ages from a few months old to 21. I recognize that given the proper guidance and a safe place to come to participate in a positive practice such as yoga, these kids will have a better chance to &quot;shine their lights&quot; and resist the negative force that the streets and their life circumstances can have on them. My vision is to make Yoga Wonderland a community for children of all abilities to get in touch with their divineness and learn strategies to cope with the challenges of their life. <br /><br />I teach a one day introductory workshop entitled: Yoga Wonderland: Creating a Fun and Therapeutic Yoga Class for Children of ALL Abilities.&nbsp; In the past, I have taught this workshop using space donated by Columbia University.&nbsp; This workshop is taught every September to the Doctor of Physical Therapy students at Columbia each year (for the past three years) as an elective in the pediatric curriculum. I look forward to teaching this in additional physical therapy programs. In addition, I do on-site workshops at pediatric facilities, schools, day care centers, recreation centers, etc.&nbsp; Please get in touch if this is something you feel would be of value at your facility.<br /><br />I teach several yoga classes each week to groups of various children, including Girl Scouts, after school programs, homeless children in temporary housing, etc. <br /><br />I am available for private sessions or group classes if you would like to organize a children&#039;s yoga class in your home or community. <br /><br />Thank you very much for your interest in my post and for your patience and time in reading it.<br /><br />Please contact me directly at <a href="mailto:mhgdpt@yahoo.com" class="bbc_email">mhgdpt@yahoo.com</a> for more information. I look forward to hearing from you soon and sharing the gift of yoga with your children.&nbsp; <br /><br />Namaste<br /><br />This is Brandon&#039;s, my 11-year-old&#039;s nephew&#039;s interpretation of Yoga Wonderland - a place where kids of all backgrounds and abilities come together to do yoga.<br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.picturepush.com/public/338620" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><img src="http://www2.picturepush.com/photo/a/338620/img/338620.gif" alt="" class="bbc_img" /></a><br /><br /><br />This is my husband&#039;s:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.picturepush.com/public/1021224" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><img src="http://www1.picturepush.com/photo/a/1021224/img/1021224.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="750" class="bbc_img resized" /></a><br /><br /></div>
