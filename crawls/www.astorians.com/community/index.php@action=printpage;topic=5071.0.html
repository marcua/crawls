				so i played hookey yesterday with the ever elusive stomach thing. i do have tummy troubles often, and well, since i have no idea when i am going to get laid off i said screw it, i don&#39;t have enough to do and i do have paid sicked days. so eff em. <br />and now, I&#39;m sitting at reception, covering for the receptionist having the worst stomach ache possible. it even hurts all the way around my sides. I&#39;m squirming it hurts so much. i don&#39;t know if i have to throw up my tea (the only thing i was willing to have once the pain started) or I&#39;m just going to suffer for the rest of the afternoon. <br />the only good thing is that i have the &quot;precedence&quot; of tummy problems from yesterday so maybe i can flee hell early.<br />i know that was gross, but i had to tell someone-this sucks big hairy donkey balls!

				Exactly where on/in your tummy do you feel this discomfort? Is it an ache as opposed to a pain? On a scale of 1–10, with 1 being minimal discomfort and 10 being a trip to the ER, what is your discomfort/ache/pain level?

				I would take Mac&#39;s questions seriously.<br /><br />You know yourself better, but if it is different or stronger than you have felt before please let your office leader know.<br />Just in case.

				if ranging towards ER i&#39;m at about a 4 or 5. lower abdomen, mostly centered, and every once in a while its like the pain is giving me a very unpleasant hug around my entire middle. between ache and pain-its pain. not constant, but when it hits i immediately double over.<br />i&#39;m working my way though some chicken soup hoping that i&#39;m just hungry-but it doesn&#39;t seem to be the root of my trouble.<br />hoping the ginger ale will help.<br />i&#39;m giving myself no more than one more hour and if it&#39;s still bothering me i am telling my boss that i am leaving.<br />not ask him, tell him.

However, describing this as pain as opposed to an ache I am wondering if your tolerance for pain is quite high.<br /><br />If it were me, and I had health insurance, I would go to the ER right now; stop eating and drinking fluids, and try to remember the last bowel movement I had and what it was like.<br /><br />Whatever you decide to do, please, please, come back to this thread and let us know how you are doing, okay?

				Hope you feel better, but if your company is going to pink slip you, karma goes out the window.&nbsp; Take the time and get better.
