				On a similar note - does anyone know what is going into the old Vital Dent Space next to Key Food on Ditmars?&nbsp; I noticed a couple of days ago that they removed the Vital Dent sign and have the windows covered up.

My landlord John owns the building where the Sushi restaurant used to be.&nbsp; After it failed, he gutted the place and is moving his flowershop over there. If you walk by around 5-7pm the door is open so you can peak inside. It is MUCH nicer than the place he has now. He is planning on moving in after the Labor Day holiday. I am not sure what is going to replace the old flower shop though.
