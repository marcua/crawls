(1010 WINS)&nbsp; -- A 16 year-old girl and three accomplices allegedly tried to rob a Commerce Bank at 37-28 Ditmars Blvd. in Astoria Friday afternoon ... and failed.<br /><br />They then went six blocks down the street to the First Central Savings Bank at around 2:30 p.m. ... And successfully robbed it.<br /><br />The girl, identified as Chrystie Almestica of Astoria, passed a note to the teller at the first central bank and got away with the cash. She allegedly managed to pass a bubdle of money off to another accomplice before the bank manager, who was getting coffee nearby, was able to chase her down with a customer and get her to surrender.<br /><br />Almestica is in custody, charged as an adult with attempted bank robbery, bank robbery and menacing, at the 114th Precinct along with another accomplice. The male suspect is unapprehended and the investigation is ongoing. <br /><br />Police think the money got away with the other two people. Police are still investigating if she was a willing accomplice or was cooerced into the robbery.<br /><br />(TM &amp; © 2007 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.

				No, her parents are there. Both mom and dad were on the 11:00 news last night. They didn&#39;t want their faces shown, but they both sounded very sad/upset.<br /><br />There&#39;s video here (http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news&amp;id=4825322) from the 5:00 news (you might have to click on it in the list of videos). On the 11:00 news, her parents were on saying that she was forced at knifepoint to do this and that&#39;s she&#39;s a good kid, etc (couldn&#39;t find video for that), and yes, I fully realize that the knifepoint thing could have just been the girl&#39;s story to the police that the parents bought. We won&#39;t know til they find the other guy or two. I hope they get a lawyer soon, because even if she was forced to do this, they shouldn&#39;t be talking to the press, you know?

				I have to agree with Jtrane.....its really easy to start blaming the parents, but while parent presence and parenting style is certainly a factor, it does not define nor predict with 100% certainty the future behavior of a child...for either better or worse...
