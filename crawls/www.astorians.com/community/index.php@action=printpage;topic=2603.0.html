				Hey guys,<br /><br />This is as much for me as it is for work reasons -- a publication I write for is planning on doing an Astoria boutiques/shopping round-up and I need some suggestions!<br /><br />I already know about Plum on 36th near 31st ave. Plus there&#39;s a vintage shop on 31st between 33rd and 34th and I saw an ad once for a kids shop in the high 30s just off Ditmars (anyone know the name/location of that place)? <br /><br />I&#39;m looking for women&#39;s clothes/shoes, home, baby, and mens shops too. Just has to be trendy and unique -- can even be pricey stuff (the audience is pretty high end)!<br /><br />Thanks oodles for your help!

				There&#39;s Lyllith - I think that&#39;s Bway and 37 or 38. <br /><br />And Queenie&#39;s on 31st Ave and 39th or 38th.<br /><br />I haven&#39;t been in either place, but they look trendy and pricey from the outside.<br /><br />There&#39;s also a place called Mimi&#39;s Closet which I haven&#39;t been to at all.

				I stopped at Mimi&#39;s Closet for the first time this past weekend. Definitely pricey (and beyond my budget!!) but very elegant clothes and jewelry, and all her stuff is hand-crafted. If you&#39;re looking for high-end, unique, and trendy, I recommend checking it out.<br /><br />31st St, between Ditmars/21st Ave

				There&#39;s a baby/young children&#39;s wear shop on 36th St. just off of Ditmars called Coo-key Boo-key, or something like that.&nbsp; Could that be the kid&#39;s shop you&#39;re referring to?&nbsp; I&#39;ve never been inside and don&#39;t know there price range, but it looks like they have some interesting things.<br /><br />I do like Blooming Company, on 31st St. between Ditmars and 23rd, underneath the Ditmars N/W stop.&nbsp; It&#39;s across the street from the post office.&nbsp; They&#39;ve got some interesting clothes, handbags (which I think are designed by the owner), jewelry, and nicknacks/gifty things.&nbsp; I&#39;ve found some good stuff in there, and the prices are pretty reasonable.

				Yeah, that store looks so cute.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I probably can&#39;t afford anything in it so it would just make me depressed&nbsp; :-(

				A new addition to the neighborhood (on 23rd Ave, between 31st &amp; 29th Streets - in the shops where the old Paradise/Metro Cafe used to be) is Sweet Boutique. It looks to have some nice clothes from the window; I haven&#39;t gotten a chance to stop in yet, but was planning to this week.<br /><br />Also relatively new is Brazilianaki on Ditmars and 32nd (I think), which has shoes, clothes, bathing suits, jewelry, and bags (and free little candies at the cash register, and I&#39;m talking good candies - mini Snickers, Milky Ways, 3 Musketeers &amp; Tootsie Pops!).

				Thanks for the ideas! Mimi&#39;s Closet, despite the pricey factor, is definitely right up my alley for this project.. Also Coo-key Boo-key is the kids place I was thinking of. I can&#39;t wait to check all these places out!<br /><br />Please keep them coming - I&#39;ll be working on this over the next couple of weeks. And if you know of any home stuff stores (home accessories, etc), I&#39;m particularly interested in those as well.

				Tonight I walked past a place called The Blooming Company. 2275 31st St.<br /><br />718.726.2161<br /><br />Might be the kind of thing you&#39;re looking for...
