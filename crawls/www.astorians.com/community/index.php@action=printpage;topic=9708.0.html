				Hi there,<br /><br />So, Hellgate CSA is full and the Astoria CSA is far away and pricey (no offense to them!). I&#039;m not sure what it would take to accomplish this, but apparently there are at least 100 people on the Hellgate waiting list. Would anyone out there like to look at creating another CSA around Ditmars? For those of us who can&#039;t fit into either of the other options? Post or PM me if you&#039;re interested and we&#039;ll go from there.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Beth

				I&#039;d suggest contacting someone at Just Food (http://www.justfood.org) if you want to start a new CSA, as they mentor CSAs in NYC and connect them with farmers. It&#039;s no easy task to run a CSA, but well worth it if you can get a good core group and good farmer(s).

				I think it&#039;s too late to get a new CSA started for this season.&nbsp; Your best bet, if Hellgate is already closed would be a share with Astorica CSA.&nbsp; It is pretty far south, but you could always get on the train out to Ditmars.&nbsp; The shares are more expensive than Hellgate, but also considerably larger. You can split a share 2 or even 3 ways to lighten the load.<br /><br />I&#039;m a core member of that CSA, and there had been some talk about there being enough people, between our waiting list and Hellgate&#039;s to start a new CSA in the area between the two.&nbsp; I live in that in between zone and would be interested in not having to travel so far with my veggies, but I didn&#039;t really have the time to be the engine behind a new CSA.&nbsp; Also, I&#039;m very happy with the food and the people in Astoria CSA.&nbsp; Nonetheless, I contacted Just Food, which is the group that helps CSAs get organized and pairs them up with farmers, but no one else from this area had contacted them so I let it drop.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would definitely be interested in talking to people who want to start a new CSA around the 30th Ave/ Broadway area closer to the N/W line, for next year.&nbsp;

				You could also just make a good effort to go to the various farmers markets around the city as often as possible. I just bought apples at the one in Union Square this afternoon, and feel just as good about purchasing straight from the farmers there as I do participating in a CSA.

				I would like to point out that Astoria CSA is &quot;so expensive&quot; because the shares are actually about 2x larger than Hellgate CSA&#039;s (which is why it&#039;s about 2x more money). So you are getting more food for the money you spend. It actually breaks down to $19 per week which is a great bargain for fresh organic veggies (comparable to the same conventional priced veggies and much less than any local organic store, Whole Foods and even greenmarkets).<br /><br />If the shares are too large or expensive Astoria CSA recommends splitting a share. The Q&amp;A was the best place to look, but you can also contact split@astoriacsa.com.<br /><br />Also, there were a lot of members from the Ditmars area that were Astoria CSA members last year. I never heard of complaints about taking veggies 1-2 stops on the train or walking/ granny carting (it beats lugging them from the City).<br /><br />Also, just a suggestion, but instead of another CSA in the Ditmars area maybe reach out to a location in between Hellgate and Astoria CSA. There are plenty of members from both CSAs that would fill this demographic and would alleviate the stress of the other 2 CSAs, freeing up space for residents that live around the CSAs. I know a member of Astoria CSA wanted to break away and start another CSA around 30th ave, west of 31st. I think another great location would be east of Steinway. As someone said, it is too late this year to start a CSA (you have start planning November-January), but Just Food (www.justfood.org) is the best place to start. Paula is the woman that works with CSAs there and she can connect any people that contact her about starting a CSA in the area to each other.<br /><br />

				I know that I can split a share, but it seems like it would be difficult to split one four ways. Even half of those big shares would be a waste for me. Has anyone done this before? It seems like it would be hard to coordinate with four people for pick up and payment.

				I think a new CSA--between Hellgate and Astoria CSA--would be amazing. I helped start Astoria CSA and am now involved in the Hellgate csa (we moved) but I would be happy to meet with anyone who was interested&nbsp; in starting a new one.&nbsp; Definitely get in touch with Justfood.org, and Paula Lukats will be very helpful. It is too late for the 2008 season but&nbsp; the perfect time, if not early to start up a csa for 2009. Please PM me and let&#039;s talk about starting a new one. <br /><br />Jayme from Hellgate CSA was great about helping the Astoria CSA get start.

				In what general area between Hellsgate &amp; Astoria CSA were you looking to have this set up?&nbsp; I am splitting a share for 2008 Astoria CSA.&nbsp; However, I would be interested in something closer for 2009 (Astoria CSA is at 35th street between 35th and 36 aves and I am located at 44th street between 30th and 31st ave).

				There were some share members in Astoria CSA last year that split 4-6 ways so it is done. I&#039;m not sure how they did it, but they figured out the payments and how to split themselves (maybe they were roommates, neighbors or close friends?). Whether they rotated pick ups, or someone split it on site and all the members trusted the first person to arrive and split, I&#039;m not sure.<br /><br />MTW- I think Gretchen was thinking of a new CSA around 30th ave and 31st street. There are a few churches right around Athens Park that could possibly host. Probably closer for you than 35th ave.

				Well, I feel like an idiot. I started this discussion and then disappeared! But I&#039;m back now.<br /><br />I emailed Just Foods and never got a response from them. It seems like it is way too late to start a CSA for this year and too early for next year. So, I suggest that we put the idea on the backburner for now and revisit in August/September. I&#039;m so glad to hear that others are interested!

				I love the idea of a new CSA on 30th Ave- nearer to Steinway if possible. In the now defunct discussion of a new farmer&#039;s market, I also thought setting one up on Newtown just off of Steinway would have been great. That area of Astoria, West of the N/W on 30th Ave and going all the way over to the beginnings of Woodside (past 48th Street on 30th) is completely underserved and just a bit too far away to make it over to the farmers market or either of the existing CSAs even if they had spaces to join. Setting up a CSA anywhere along 30th would be great as there is a bus that runs along it and folks could just hop on that. I think you&#039;d find a lot of interest. <br />L

				Hi Beth,<br /><br />A couple of friends of mine and I had the same experience (not being able to sign up for a CSA), so we have been in contact with Just Food and we are starting a new CSA in the broadway area (since Just Food had mentioned that are already two in the upper ditmars area).&nbsp; I dont know if you&#039;d still be interested, but we&#039;re in the process of getting a core group together (there are about four of us right now).&nbsp; Would you be interested in being part of the core-group for a new CSA in the broadway/crescent area?&nbsp; If you are, you should reply to the post on starting a new CSA posted a few days ago.&nbsp; Let us know!<br />
