				I guess it depends on where in Astoria you live and whether you have a car or not but we have a bunch of good parks scattered about the neighborhood.&nbsp; Astoria Park, I think, being our best one.&nbsp;

				A couple of recommendations:<br />-&nbsp; PS 1 in LIC has a great exhbit of a swimming pool (not an actual pool) that is so fun for kids. <br />-&nbsp; NY Hall of Science next to flushing Meadows park (#7 to Shea station) is a fantastic science museum for kids.&nbsp; A membership to the museum is highly recommended because they have reciprocity with lots of other great kids museums such as:&nbsp; Brooklyn Children&#039;s museum (a fantastic kids museum), Intrepid, Liberty Science Museum and others.<br />-&nbsp; Also I know you don&#039;t want to take the kids into the city but the NW train takes you easily to Central Park where they can enjoy the park, the fantastic playgrounds in the park, and the zoo.<br />-&nbsp; I&#039;d lastly recommend you join www.astoriafamlies.org.&nbsp; It is a site for families to talk about raising kids in Astoria.&nbsp; There are family friendly events listed on the calendar for events in and around Astoria.<br /><br />best of luck exploring with your kids.

				I have a four year old boy &amp; a one year old girl.&nbsp; &nbsp;We try to take advantage of all the city has to offer.&nbsp; Once you start looking you&#039;ll discover a new and wonderful NY&nbsp; that is full of lots of adventures for your kids.&nbsp; Feel free to email for questions or if you need a playdate.&nbsp; Our weekends are a little tight but never too tight to squeeze in a playground visit.&nbsp; <br />Another suggestion I forgot to mention is to always pick up Time Out Kids,&nbsp; Queens Parent, &amp; Queens Family.&nbsp; There are always great activities listed there.<br />glad you went to the zoo.&nbsp; We love Central park zoo.&nbsp; We also really really love Queens zoo (at flushing meadow park) &amp; the little carousal next to it.&nbsp;
