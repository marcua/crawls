I&#39;m confusedâ€”not that I wasn&#39;t born this way! What has all *that* got to do with a film playing in the neighborhood today?

				I saw The Departed last week and really enjoyed it, especially as some of the climactic scenes at the end were filmed near my old neighborhood in Boston.&nbsp; Have fun!

				I actually felt like they were a bit exaggerated and inconsistent, even Marky Mark and Matt Damon, which was suprising as they&#39;re both locals.&nbsp; It was mostly the inconsistency that did in the accents for me.&nbsp; My husband thought that Leonardo DiCaprio sounded the most authentic, and he swears that his character totally fit the profile of a Southie.&nbsp; We had a lot of fun seeing the Boston locations, and trying to figure out where Matt Damon&#39;s apartment was located - we&#39;re thinking across the Boston Common from Beacon Hill.<br /><br />Jennifer, how did you guys like the movie?&nbsp; Has anyone here seen Infernal Affairs (the Hong Kong film on which The Departed was based)?

				We really enjoyed the movie - it was totally entertaining for 2.5 hours. <br />And... there were no crying kids at the theater (bonus)<br />and the popcorn was good and fresh (double bonus)<br />and Telly and Dulouz showed up (triple... )

				And it had me biting finger nails, sitting on the edge of my seat waiting for bad things to happen.&nbsp; Havent seen such suspense in a while.&nbsp; <br /><br />Jack was awesome<br />Dicapria excellent <br />Others were good too<br />Alec Baldwin not so good.<br /><br />
