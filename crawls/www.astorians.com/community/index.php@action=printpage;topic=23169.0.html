				That&#039;s a shame.&nbsp; But the fact is that it was a great place with really delicious food - but in a very bad location.&nbsp; Hardly anyone even knew it existed.

				We had a Groupon for this place and tried to use it on a whim on an early Saturday evening. Turns out they were closed. We emailed Groupon asking for a refund or credit and they investigated this further, reporting that there was a plumbing issue and the place will be closed for a month(?) while work is being done. No idea on the validity of this claim. This was about 3-4 weeks ago.

				I hope you are right. It was my fave. <br /><br />There was a groupin deal around fathers day. I was gonna buy it, procrastinated till later in day, went back and it said SOLD OUT. But what was weird was only 3 people brought. <br /><br />Def sounds like it was closed in an emergency. <br /><br />There website isn&#039;t around anymore

				I had a terrible experience at Aegean Cove. Good riddance.<br /><br /><br />I had a groupon for 2 entrees, appetizer, and 2 glasses of wine.<br /><br /><br />I ordered 2 entrees, appetizer, and 3 glasses of wine for 3 people.<br /><br /><br />The waiter brought the 2 entrees ordered, and instead of the appetizer ordered, brought a very similar entree instead, so there was no way to know we did not get what we ordered.<br /><br /><br />At the end of the meal, we got a bill for 1 glass of wine, plus the entree that we did not order. It&#039;s ridiculous that they thought we ordered 3 entrees and didn&#039;t want the appetizer that I paid for with the Groupon. When we told the manager, he said that we ate it so we had to pay for it.<br /><br /><br />After much arguing, he brought out another bill taking $10 off. Then after more arguing he said that he had to charge us the tax as if we used 2 Groupons since we had 3 people, even though we didn&#039;t get all of the food that would be included if we had 2 Groupons.<br /><br /><br />This manager was a stubborn ass and was talking in circles so we just paid that amount and wrote a bad review on yelp.<br /><br /><br />The food tasted rubbery and not very fresh, too. The wine was very low quality.

				It seems like, at least lately, if you see a restaurant (or perhaps, any business) offering a Groupon, there&#039;s a very good chance they will soon be out of business.<br /><br /><br />I never went to this place, but there are so many good restaurants in the area offering great food AND great service that there&#039;s no use wasting time on places that don&#039;t offer both.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				It&#039;s been closed for a long while, at least a month now. I remember I saw a livingsocial deal for it right before it closed EVERYDAY. Thank god I didn&#039;t get one. Hate scammer. I live two blocks away and never seen anyone go in to do work. Did see a man came to check on the mail once.

				I wonder if having earned a &quot;C&quot; grade might have had something to do with it.<br /><br /><br /><br />Maybe word spread through the grapevine a while back-like in January- when they were awarded 61 points and then were re-inspected and couldn&#039;t do any better than 31 points. Was it that simple?
