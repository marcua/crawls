			<strong>Pawgny</strong>:

			I was recently introduced to water kefir. I was given some grains and took-on the procedure as an experiment. I started out with a tablespoon of grains and now have 1 1/2 cups of grains - they grow like gremlins with me. After drinking the brew I have created (5 weeks now), I feel many improvements.&nbsp; I&#039;m addicted to caring for this food pet. <br /><br /><br />Anyone on this board experimenting with water kefir?

			I have worked with water kefir grains in the past. Know that they ferment faster in warmer weather! Do you do a second fermentation with them? Also, I&#039;ll take extra off your hands if you ever need to offload some of your grains!

			I&#039;ve been doing the second fermentation, yes. I&#039;ve been using lemon, cranberry and ginger in the fermentation process&#039;. I would be happy to gift you some grains :)
