				Hello fellow parents, <br />One of my kids is starting kindergarten next fall, probably at the Vallone school.&nbsp; We are pondering the question of what to do with him after 3 pm, since we can&#039;t pick him up until around 6.&nbsp; Does anyone have any experience or suggestions to share?&nbsp; Also, if you are in a similar situation -- please feel free to PM me.&nbsp; I might be able to do some kind of cooperative pick up arrangement with other parents. <br /><br />Thanks!

				Immaculate Conception has an after school program I believe - as does Grace Lutheran.&nbsp; Can you team up with another parent to have them bring your child there?

				As you may have discovered in your search, out of our local public schools, neither PS 84, PS 85 or PS 2 have an after school program. They all try for spots in the Beacon program.<br /><br />Just spoke to Champions at PS 122 and they will not have a Kindergarten program next year, unless families have an older child in Champions. So that means there is no public program for UPK or K in the area. Grace Lutheran offers private after school care for those ages and LIC kids and Serious Fun do as well. Other private schools require that your child be enrolled in the school to take advantage of after school care, that was my understanding for the Immac program.&nbsp; Have they opened it up to parents outside of their school?<br /><br />Steinway Church is holding a meeting aout this on Saturday, sponsored by thier program, Serious Fun, which I run for them.&nbsp; I&#039;ve posted it on the board: Sat Jun 20 at 11:00.&nbsp; I&#039;m gathering info on all programs I can think of and would love to hear suggestions and experiences from everyone.&nbsp; If you can&quot;t come but want to contribute, please PM me.<br /><br />Thanks.

				Thanks.. Queens Lutheran apparently is not accepting anyone for afterschool until August, when they know what their enrollment will be.&nbsp; A little problematic for parents who have to have care arrangements before school starts, but there you go.&nbsp; Do you know if 122 for sure won&#039;t have a program for kindergarteners -- when I spoke to them earlier in the year they said they didn&#039;t think so, because of budget cuts, but they didn&#039;t know for sure yet. <br />Thanks! Rachel.

				I have a 2yr old in day care now and am probably am going to have the similar problem like you all in a couple of years.&nbsp; I recall seeing last fall that somone posted a &quot;Van Service&quot; near PS 122 that would take the child from the school to any afterschool program, such as the boys girls club, Luthern School etc.&nbsp; <br /><br />Does anyone know what I am talking about?&nbsp; Is this a good option?&nbsp;
