				While I certainly don&#039;t discount Vick&#039;s transgressions and hope he is punished to the extent of the law, I find it interesting that there are several professional athletes that have been accused AND convicted of beating their wife and/or girlfriend, and have had no where near the publicity, or punishment from the sports league that employs them.<br /><br />http://www.dailyherald.com/story/?id=22399

				I think that there is a muted reaction to domestic violence because nobody has any idea what to do about it. People shake their heads when they read about it, like the wrestler that killed his wife and child. It&#039;s beyond horrible. Everybody agrees on this, and at the same time nobody knows what the solution is.&nbsp; And I think many people know how complicated dealing with it is, because of all the dynamics at play. Women are isolated, they stay out of fear, are in more danger when they leave, repeatedly go back to the abuser, orders of protection are ineffective, etc.&nbsp; Police or talking heads on t.v. repeatedly say that when a man is determined to kill his partner, he will do it. I think that the crimes are&nbsp; in the media a lot, but other than that, no follow-up.&nbsp; Even measures that were initially seen as positive, like mandatory arrest after a domestic violence call, has come under criticism recently. I read something just the other week where a study found that approach counterproductive.&nbsp; It&#039;s a societal problem and I don&#039;t know what the answer is.

				May Vick be the bitch of some really crazy dude in prison for what he did to those dogs. May he be tortured day and night..........and just when he&#039;s about to be released on the world again, I pray someone cuts his throat with a dull knife, while they pour water on him as they put a live wire where the sun don&#039;t shine. Get my drift? And this time I&#039;m NOT kidding around.

				Out of curiousity, I checked the status of all the domestic violence cases by sports figures cited in the article Jtrane linked to.<br /><br />Kim Wickman got the charges dropped against her husband Brett Myers. Even though there were witnesses and evidence of injury.&nbsp; According to the Phillies website they&#039;re still married.<br />&nbsp;http://www.dailyherald.com/story/?id=22399 (http://www.dailyherald.com/story/?id=22399)&nbsp; <br /><br />Bobby Chouinard&#039;s wife told the court at sentencing that she lied to the police and that he never held a gun to her head.&nbsp; Judge didn&#039;t buy it.&nbsp; &nbsp;He served jail time, probation,&nbsp; ordered to give 25k to a domestic violence charity and make 10 anti-domestic violence PSA&#039;s, get counseling etc.<br /><br />Michael Pittman&#039;s wife dropped the charges, and asked the state to drop them too. Basically she said everyone makes mistakes.&nbsp; They are still married and have had 3 more children since the assault. She is featured prominently on his official website in the area &quot;Mrs. Pitt&#039;s corner.&quot;<br />http://www.sptimes.com/2003/06/11/Bucs/Pittman_s_wife_won_t_.shtml (http://www.sptimes.com/2003/06/11/Bucs/Pittman_s_wife_won_t_.shtml)

				Professional sports is about money. I think these character clauses in contracts are window dressing. So the major league associations will swat all kinds of behavior on the wrist if they value the player.&nbsp; &nbsp;If the women drop charges, recant, ask for leniency, that&#039;s just the &quot;out&quot; the league is going to latch on to. I&#039;m not excusing it, it&#039;s totally bogus, just trying to explain why they get lenient treatment.&nbsp; &nbsp;In time, despite all the outcry, the Vick case will be forgotten. I would not be at all surprised if he plays again.&nbsp; I think that&#039;s why he only pleaded guilty to the dog fighting, but not the gambling. This plea deal gives him solid hope of returning after a short jail term.&nbsp; It may look now that there is a bigger outcry over the dogfighting than the spousal abuse, but in the end all of them will play again.&nbsp; &nbsp;There has been a steady drum beat of supporters crying&nbsp; racism, example-making, others do worse, etc. that is setting the stage for his return.&nbsp;

				I can assure you that if Vick electrocuted, drowned and strangled a minimum of eight women because they underperformed, I would be just as indignant.<br /><br />(or course, if he was financing and operating an illegal mud wrestling ring .....)

				I tried really hard to find a great webcomic that summed up my take on this. The punch line was that since dogs obviously get this huge amount of sympathy, we should drop some of them in Iraq and the Sudan so that when they get hurt or killed the American people will sit up and take notice. I thought the comic was from &quot;This Modern Life&quot; but apparently it wasn&#039;t. <br /><br />Anyway, this works just as well (from marginalrevolution.com):<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><strong>&quot;Overcoming Bias&quot;</strong><br />After attending dogfights it&#039;s rumored that on some nights Michael Vick would continue his bloody activities by dining on cow&#039;s flesh.&nbsp; No word yet on whether prosecutors will be seeking additional prison time.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I think Ellieworm made the point, but isn&#039;t the difference that human beings have more control over their actions and can leave an abusive situation barring being tied to a wall? The dogs were held captive. And I&#039;m sure some will argue that women may feel trapped in a situation where they are beaten, but that is an argument that I disagree with and don&#039;t care to get involved in.

				There are no easy answers.&nbsp; But I do feel for these women and wish there was more we could do for them.&nbsp; I think we&#039;d have to find out why these men commit violence against women in the first place, to solve the problem from the ground up.&nbsp; I would think it is learned, from their parents growing up, a horrible cycle repeating itself, and from society, media, all sorts of factors. <br /><br />excerpt from the article:&nbsp; <br />http://www.dailyherald.com/story/?id=22399<br /><br />According to endabuse.org, citing statistics from, among other sources, the U.S. Department of Justice, from 1 million to 3 million women per year are physically abused in the United States; on average, more than three women are murdered by husbands or boyfriends in this country every day; and homicide is the leading cause of death for pregnant women.<br /><br />&quot;The most dangerous moment in her life is when a woman leaves an abusive relationship,&#039;&#039; Goodmark said. &quot;Physical abuse is part of the system of control, and when she says she&#039;s leaving, she&#039;s saying, &#039;You don&#039;t control me anymore.&#039; That&#039;s the time he intensifies the abuse to ensure he doesn&#039;t lose control.<br /><br />&quot;The reality is many women do leave and many are abused or killed.&#039;&#039;<br /><br />It has been suggested that wives of rich athletes often don&#039;t press charges or leave their husbands because they don&#039;t want to give up the good life.<br /><br />&quot;There are a lot of reasons they don&#039;t leave, be it religious, housing, economics or children,&#039;&#039; Goodmark said. &quot;Killing children is one of the ultimate expressions of hatred and control. He takes away the thing that matters more to her than anything else.<br /><br />&quot;The worst are the ones who kill the kids and leave the mom alive so that it hurts even more. Don&#039;t think that some of these women who don&#039;t leave haven&#039;t been told that if they leave, the husband or boyfriend will kill the children.<br /><br />&quot;It&#039;s just sad that with everything we know, someone would say that these women deserve what they get for staying.&#039;&#039;<br /><br />When pro wrestler Chris Benoit murdered his wife and strangled his 7-year-old son before killing himself, nearly every story was about how steroids played a part in the violence.<br /><br />There was no outrage over a murdered mom, over the death of an innocent child.

				And so no one can have indignation and an expression of anger on an issue because of the perceived lack of outcry on the issue of domestic violence against women?<br /><br />Wanna talk about turning a blind eye?&nbsp; Where is the outrage over the millions trapped in wage slavery (which most people on this board profit quite nicely from)?&nbsp; Where is the outrage over 12% of the population comprising 60% of our prison population?&nbsp; Why does everyone know we&#039;ve had 3,300+ of our youth buy the farm in Iraq and approximations on Iraqi dead are made with an error of +/- 100,000?&nbsp; Where is the outrage that Astoria is a segregated community?&nbsp; Where is the outrage that the food that fills the restaurants that we pick and fret over is for the most part produced by exploited workers toiling under horrible working conditions?&nbsp; I stopped watching tv a decade ago because of this country&#039;s fascination/outrage with an ex-ball player sending his wife off in the meat wagon.<br /><br />No one is trying to minimize the issue of violence against women by athletes, but you are introducing a logic which can only engulf your own opinion.&nbsp; By casting aspirtion on those with outrage over what Vick has done because we don&#039;t get as upset when another ballplayer puts his woman in ICU is spurious at best.
