				Hi all,<br /><br />After moving to Long Island City, close to the 21st Street &amp; Broadway post office, I have been appalled by the unreliable mail service.&nbsp; I see that there are a couple threads acknowledging that the area served (or at least part of it) by this USPS branch has had trouble for years.&nbsp; <br /><br />I do not get very much mail -- at least not very much that I care about.&nbsp; But I do find that when I am actually expecting something the mail is lost with an alarming frequency.&nbsp; My magazine subscriptions routinely disappear.&nbsp; I have had personal letters get lost.&nbsp; And most recently a new credit card never made it to my apartment.<br /><br />Now I realize that you get what you pay for and that forty-some-cents does is a great price to have a letter delivered across the county, even if it only gets there part of the time.&nbsp; But nevertheless, the postal service is the only game in town and every so often I actually need it.<br /><br />Who here else shares the problem?&nbsp; Anyone managed to solve it?

				I get my mail from that post office, and I have problems all the time, especially with missing magazines.&nbsp; I&#039;m in a big building, and we also get a lot of misdirected mail (either to the wrong apartment, or mail for someone at a completely different address).

				I am in the zone for another post office, but have had problems with them as well.<br /><br />I now have things delivered to my manhattan office, or do as much as humanly possible via the internet.<br /><br />There is no recourse, I&#039;ve tried the regional customer service and gotten nowhere.

				Absolutely.&nbsp; Getting packages at my apt is always a crapshoot.&nbsp; It&#039;s fine if I get an orange slip to pick up something since I live close to the post office, but lately the postal worker has neglected to leave a slip so I don&#039;t know for sure if they tried to deliver or not.&nbsp; I had a package sent back because of that.&nbsp; Very annoying.

				I had this kind of trouble for a long time with the branch at 21st Street near 30th Ave. For a long time they left my<br />magazines laying in my lobby so that many were stolen, as were packages that used to just be left in the lobby.<br /><br />A friend of mine who worked for the post office advised me to contact the postmaster general for LIC. This was back<br />in 2002, so it may be a different person now but you can probably check. You have to write to them - e-mailing and calling<br />does no good. <br /><br />I got so fed up that I started sending him invoices for my missing magazines. I kept at it weekly until someone spoke to<br />our carrier. He hated me - told me that it wasn&#039;t their fault that the mags didn&#039;t fit in my box, blah blah blah. <br /><br />My response: this is merchandise that I have already paid for. If it doesn&#039;t fit in the box, leave a call card and I&#039;ll pick it<br />up promptly.<br /><br />But my friend had told me that the carriers get a lot of flack from their managers if they come back with anything but an<br />empty bag. <br /><br />But here&#039;s the name/address I had then. Like I said, the location must be the same, but check the name:<br /><br />Mike Menasche<br />Postmaster General, Long Island City<br />46-02 21 Street<br />Long Island City, NY 11101<br /><br />

				More recently - the procedure is this.<br /><br />1) file a complaint at your local post office with the supervisor on duty<br />2) call 800-275-8777 to file an official complaint<br />3) call the regional supervisor (718) 321-5570 to follow up with the complain number you receive from step 2.<br />4) if this fails - write to:Consumer Avocate, 475 L&#039;enfant Plaza, Washington, DC 20260-2200
