				New signage is up at the former Buon Appetito Deli at 36-12 Ditmars.&nbsp; &quot;The Pomeroy is a new restaurant and bar in Astoria Queens serving seasonal New American Comfort food with a gastropub vibe,&quot;&nbsp; according to a posting advertising for waitstaff.&nbsp; This certainly bodes better than the recent hookah bar opening at 38th St.&nbsp; has anyone heard anything further?

				I googled &quot;Pomeroy Ditmars&quot; and learned that 37th Street used to be called Pomeroy (http://forgotten-ny.com/2009/07/life-on-ditmars-northern-astorias-main-street/). That&#039;s a nice touch....

				Here&#039;s an article about the new restaurant<br /><br />http://astoriapost.com/the-pomeroy-on-ditmars-to-open-next-week/<br /><br />It says they will be open for dinner from 5PM-11.&nbsp; What about being open for lunch?&nbsp; Jimmy&#039;s Puerto Rican restaurant was only open for dinner and they didnt&#039; do good at all.&nbsp; I would rather go for lunch than dinner

				I&#039;m not generally in Astoria at lunch time but the hours do seem surprising.&nbsp; If a good part of their business is a bar, they should open by 4 and have a happy hour and probably stay open until 2 am - if not later.&nbsp; Maybe this is just at the beginning to feel things out.&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve been here twice since its opened! The drinks are really yummy and so is the food. I do think the food is a little pricey, but it&#039;s definitely a place you can go with friends, order a few things, and share. I spoke with the head bartender and he said that they will open for lunch and brunch soon, but that they&#039;re starting with dinner until they&#039;ve gotten everything down.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s a great addition to the Ditmars area!

				&quot;Isn&#039;t a non-chain restaurant a mom and pop?&quot;<br /><br />OK, to be more clear, what I&#039;m getting at is &#039;old-school&#039; versus new school.&nbsp; Places for newbie residents (sorta hipsters) vs places for the more blue-collar, long-standing residents of Astoria.<br /><br />Lefkos/Tasty&#039;s/The Bagel House/Irish pubs/diners under the N/Q versus Sixty Beans/Tru/Pomeroy/Astoria Bier &amp; Cheese <br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong...some of the new places are great, but without the old school Astoria&#039;s no longer Astoria.&nbsp; I like both the new and the old-school placces, but at the rate things are changing along Ditmars, well....&nbsp;

				I hear what you are saying. There&#039;s a lot of evidence that Lefkos, for example, was downright rude to people who weren&#039;t their kind. If true, it&#039;s no surprise that their business suffered. I think there&#039;s room in Astoria for old and new businesses to succeed (if they deserve it). Businesses come and go and many do / will have to adapt to succeed.

				None of this is cut and dried. Some of the &quot;new&quot; style places (e.g., 60 Beans) are run by neighborhood old-timers. Some of the old-style places more or less suck (e.g., Lefkos Pyrgos). Some of the things that feel old school are actually fairly recent arrivals (e.g., Trattoria L&#039;Incontro, Ornella). Plenty of new places are opening that cater to the longstanding population (e.g., new Mediterranean Foods, Astoria Tavern). We live in NYC, not in Colonial Williamsburg, and everything is eventually going to change. Some will be good, some will be bad.

				<br />Yes, Litza...I guess I never looked at it that way...that some new businesses are intended to cater to the more long-standing residents of Astoria.&nbsp; However, you can&#039;t deny that overall, the trend seems to be that businesses in the area are more and more skewed towards the newer residents.&nbsp; And at its current pace, well...it causes me quite a bit of concern.&nbsp; I have this huge fear (and I hope it&#039;s unfounded!) that Astoria is going to start to look/feel like Williamsburg, in which case I will surely leave.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve only lived in the Ditmars/Steinway area for just over a year (before that I was in another part of Astoria closer to 30th Ave.).&nbsp; And in this one year at Ditmars/Steinway, the transformation of Ditmars has been striking...not only with regards to the businesses, but the number of people living in the area.<br /><br />Btw, liked your Colonial Williamsburg reference.&nbsp; &nbsp;:laugh:

				<br />I second what Debbie says....not that I&#039;ve been to Lefkos more than once...and it was like 10 or so years ago, but...<br /><br />I think it could be just how Greeks engage with each other...I think some Americans take things too literally...like when they hear people from other cultures &#039;yelling&#039; at each other.&nbsp; lol.&nbsp; <br /><br />When I first started eating at a particular Greek restaurant in the nabe, I too thought the waitstaff were rather rude/indifferent.&nbsp; Now that I&#039;m a &#039;regular&#039; at the place, I&#039;ve changed my perspective...I think that&#039;s just how they come off, but they are in fact generally very warm....it&#039;s just that at first glance they may not seem that way.&nbsp;

I brought a female friend from Athens there who ended up getting a argument with the woman(owner?). My friend is very easy-going and was floored by how rude this woman is. They were speaking in Greek so I have no idea what was said. I think the problem is not a cultural misunderstanding but someone who is just very difficult to deal with.

				I just had to comment on that little Lefkos nugget.&nbsp; I lived nearby there from 97 to 2008 and they were just rude.&nbsp; The price was whatever they felt like on that particular day for me. I used to buy pastries from there to bring to the office on occasion and it was crazy how unfriendly they were.&nbsp; I did warn my guests that the price be random for the coffee from one day to the next.&nbsp; &nbsp;I remember a buy distinctly being unfriendly but I never actually had anyone behave in normal customer service way to me.&nbsp; You just had to steel yourself or laugh it off like a Fawlty Towers episode.
