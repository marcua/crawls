				Hi,<br /><br />Does anyone have any type of information on the Queensview Co-Op&#039;s?&nbsp; What are the apartments like?&nbsp; Is it a Mitchell-Lama building?&nbsp; Are there mostly families / younger people / older people living there?&nbsp; Any info would be appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks.

				I looked at a co-op at Queensview about a year ago and it was actually really nice. It was a nice size two bedroom with a view of the Manhattan Skyline and a decent amount of storage space. The kitchen was very small- but the rest of the apartment was a nice size. The price was also really reasonable and the grounds were well kept. We ultimately did not move there because we are looking to buy a house as opposed to a co-op or condo- but I have to say I was quite impressed with what I saw. My one concern was that it was a hike to the N/W train as it was located on the other side of 21st street. (heading toward the East River) I have a friend that lives there with his wife and two kids in a three bedroom co-op and seems very happy there.<br /><br />&nbsp;There are also Queenview Co-ops located right abound the corner from me - on the other side of 21st Street and those seem to be very well run and well kept as well.

				I live in Queensview and have lived there for my entire life.&nbsp; My grandparents and mom moved in there in 1953, three years after it was built.&nbsp; I have nothing but good things to say about Queensview.&nbsp; The buildings, while not fancy or &quot;luxury,&quot; are very well maintained.&nbsp; Apartments are very spacious and come in basically three sizes:&nbsp; 1 bedroom (3.5 rooms), 2 bedroom (4.5 rooms), and 3 bedroom (5.5 rooms).&nbsp; There is a children&#039;s playground and a basketball court on premises as well as plenty of open space.&nbsp; There is a lot of grass and trees plus plenty of places to sit and enjoy the grounds.&nbsp; The residents are mostly older, but a lot of younger people have been moving in recently (WE NEED MORE!!!).&nbsp; For the senior citizens, there is a NORC -- a Naturally Occurring Retirement Community -- which offers social services and social programming.&nbsp; There is also an excellent nursery school on the grounds.&nbsp; Queensview is comprised of 14 buildings and covers one square block between 21st and Crescent and 33rd Road and 34th Avenue.&nbsp; Queensview has its own security force which patrols the area almost 24 hours per day.&nbsp; I&#039;d say that the area is safe.&nbsp; Prices of apartments are extremely reasonable -- they are actually NOT on the open market, so when a cooperator wants to sell, he or she can only sell to the coop, which pays a fixed price based on the current share price, which increases from time to time.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know exact prices, but a one bedroom is under $200,000.&nbsp; However, income requirements tend to be high.&nbsp; It was started as a middle-income, affordable housing development and has been maintained as such today.&nbsp; There has been some movement lately toward moving to open market sales.&nbsp; Although such a proposal was voted down in the last few years, it will likely come up again.&nbsp; Maintenance has doubled in the last 5 years, but is still reasonable.<br />Finally, I want to correct an earlier post -- the buildings across 21st St. are NOT part of Queensview.&nbsp; They are in what is technically called &quot;North Queensview Homes,&quot; but which most people in Queensview call &quot;Queensview West.&quot;&nbsp; Those apartments ARE on the open market, and consequently cost more than Queensview to purchase, but I believe the maintenance is lower.<br />If anyone has any questions about Queensview, I would be happy to answer.

				I&#039;m not in those buildings, but I do know that after 9/11, with the LARGE property tax increase on NYC residents ---maintenance charges went up significantly in all coops as that is included in the monthly maintenance.<br /><br />It&#039;s hit everyone along the boards.<br />

				I also live in Queensview, I&#039;ve lived here for six years this month. I have what is called a 3 1/2 room apartment. The size is roughly 770 square feet. I love it here, the apartments are VERY well laid out, every apartment in the complex is a corner unit with 2 exposures and really nice cross ventilation. I have a beautiful view of the Triboro Bridge and I can see the N/W train from my windows. It is a VERY quiet apartment. They allow cats but no dogs. The maintenance when I moved in was something like $330 a month including gas and electric. Then 9-11 happened, and the city needed cash and raised property taxes quite a bit and thats what prompted the first big increase. It hasn&#039;t quite doubled, but it has gone up since I bought in. Mine is still below $600 a month (including Gas and Electric) which I think is well below average for a Co-Op apartment in NYC.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />You can&#039;t just walk up and buy an apartment, there is a waiting list. For me, it took about 9 months to get offered an apartment. I have no idea what the list is like these days, I do know for a while a couple of years ago, the list was closed with too many people waiting to get in. A lot of the shareholders have been here from day one, so there are a lot of retirees. Just like anywhere else, I have neighbors that I adore and people that I run from when I see them coming. I have never felt unsafe here at any hour but just like everywhere else in NYC, things do happen and you need to pay attention to what you are doing.&nbsp; <br /><br />For more info call the office (718) 728-5090 and they will send you an application or google for the website. <br />Hope this helps.

				Billhill is absolutely correct -- the maintenance has almost doubled because of increased property taxes as well as huge increases in electric, water, and fuel oil (heating) bills.&nbsp; All utilities are included in the maintenance, but for years there has been talk of &quot;submetering,&quot; which is putting individual electric meters in each apt. so each person pays for what they use.&nbsp; But it is still a great deal, and I really can&#039;t see why more young people don&#039;t move in given the low cost of the apartments and the proximity of the co-op to Manhattan.

				I wonder if they ever had their bell/buzzer/security system updated. You used to have to meet delivery people downstairs at the front door because there was no direct bell/buzzer system.

				I&#039;m gonna add to the dog thing, I LOVE DOGS, had great dogs at home growing up that were like members<br />of our family. But there are over 700 apartments here and you&#039;re bound to get at least one idiot who mistreats <br />an animal or trains an animal for fighting, so you wind up with a VERY aggressive, nasty dog trying to <br />attack people on the property, in the lobby or on the elevator. Not the poor dogs fault mind you, but think of the potential lawsuits. Then there is the nightmare and red tape of trying to evict such a person which can take years, its better and easier to just not allow dogs.<br /><br />As for no unmarried couples, I have never heard such a thing. This place looks like the rest of NYC to me, I see gay couples, mixed race couples, single mothers, couples with a huge difference in age. These folks can&#039;t ALL be married, lol!! I&#039;m not saying that there wasn&#039;t such a rule (probably undocumented) when this place was first built over 50 years ago, but I doubt there is now. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I always found the dog prohibition thing a little warped. We all have read the studies showing how the older population, and folks, Queensview is still populated with so many of the original owners, benefits from dog ownership. The exercise in walking them and the companionship. I remember a lady who&#039;s son and daughter-in-law were killed in a terrible automobile accident, who took in their very small 14-year old, 7 pound Maltese and was threatened by the damn board. This poor little guy wouldn&#039;t have lived more than a couple of years. And I guess the board has finally come into the 20th Century (not an error) in allowing unmarrieds to live together! It most definitely was a problem previously.

				So I went by on Friday and took a look at a 1 bedroom apartment that was about ready to be occupied.&nbsp; As NTrain mentioned, the building (elevator, hallways etc..) and the grounds looked to be very well maintained.&nbsp; The apartment itself had a really good layout with lots of light.&nbsp; The current price for a 1 bedroom is $147,000, $568.50 monthly rent, a minimum 20% down payment and minimum $55,000 annual income.&nbsp; All in all not a bad deal when you think of the high prices that their asking for apartments in new construction these days.<br /><br />As for the whole dog debate - I grew up on Roosevelt Island and dogs had been prohibited from there since the start.&nbsp; My parents knew about it going in and it was something that you lived with no matter how much you wanted a pup.&nbsp; I understand that as soon you start making exceptions for one person, you&#039;re going to have people breaking down your door looking for the same.

				No, no babies, you have to check your babies in a special sound proof bin <br />before you enter the complex. :)<br /><br />I have no idea about schools in the area, I don&#039;t have kids.<br /><br />As far as Ravenswood, I&#039;ve lived on the 33rd ROAD side, which is the other side of<br />the complex, for 6 years, so I can&#039;t tell you much about Ravenswood.

Ravenswood really doesn&#039;t have the negative impact you seem to be looking for. Obviously you don&#039;t ignore it, Ravenswood, like Queensview-proper, is part of the neighborhood. The area&#039;s definitely gentrifying a bit, like the rest of LIC/astoria, but it was never the kind of neighborhood where staying the same would be a bad thing.<br /><br />As for the schools, North Queensview is zoned for a pretty good elementary school.

				I live in North Queensview, and only recently moved there about 6 months ago. I love it- the people are incredibly friendly and you get a good deal for your money. There are a lot of elderly people, but also many young families.<br /><br />It is close to the subway, city views, and lots of space. Dogs are allowed. Ravenswood is really not a problem at all, in my experience. Another benefit of the co-op is that parking is just $500 a year, security on premises, etc. A very strong sense of community.

				I was looking at the Queensview (not the North Queensview) doc archive and there&#039;s something about reconstitution of the co-op.&nbsp; Does anybody know anything about that?&nbsp; Reconstitution is something about going from one type of co-op to another (i.e. going market).&nbsp; I wonder what was the Queensview reconstitution about.

				I&#039;m sure I&#039;m butchering this but I believe the reconstitution in 1990 had to do with switching <br />from a public Co-op to a private one. Meaning the Co-op was no longer eligible for <br />government funding and there were no more restrictions on what could be charged<br />to buy in and become a shareholder.<br /><br />Prior to 1990 the asking price was REALLY low, several or so hundred dollars per room to buy in.<br />I&#039;ve heard before 1990 it was IMPOSSIBLE to get in here as no one ever left knowing that sooner or<br />later they were going to go private. Once the reconstitution took place, lots of apartments became available<br />as people had been waiting for the price increase to sell.<br /><br />That was long before my time and someone could do a much better job explaining it all.<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Hey there,<br />I was hoping some Queensview residents could fill me in.<br />I saw this posting months ago and learned about Queensview.&nbsp; Silly me had been living right next door for 2 1/2 years and had no idea about it.&nbsp; So we jumped on it quick because it seems like an amazing deal.&nbsp; We put in our application and found out that it was accepted.&nbsp; Now we just need to go in for the coop board interview.&nbsp; What kind of questions do they ask?&nbsp; Do we have anything to be worried about?&nbsp; Also, we are a lesbian couple so do you think that will be a problem?&nbsp; I know a lot of the people who interview are older.<br />Anything else do you think we need to know about Queensview before we buy?&nbsp; Are you happy overall there?<br />It seems like a great place and community.&nbsp; <br />Thanks for your time.

				Hi Samara,<br /><br />I was wondering if you would mind sharing when you submitted your application and when you got a call from Queensview about the interview.

				I believe I put in the application a little over 2 months ago.&nbsp; I stopped in last week to check on it, because they also told me that they would send me a letter which I never received.&nbsp; Teresa looked it up and said the application was approved and they would be contacting us after Thanksgiving for an interview.&nbsp; So you probably will be contacted soon as well and then hopefully we will be neighbors soon!

I was going to call next week for the third time since I submitted the application in September (I figured I would wait until after the holidays).

To be told every time that you&#039;re about the be called for an interview (and my income levels, according to them, were approved), and then hear nothing, it&#039;s frustrating.

I&#039;ll provide an update next week when I call again, but I&#039;m not very optimistic. Maybe we should all form a support group&nbsp; :roll:

				I grew up in Queensview and my parents and two of my sisters still live there.<br /><br />The apartments are really amazingly sized for the price.<br /><br />The area to the south isn&#039;t the best because you border Ravenswood Houses, but in 24 years of living there before moving out, I can&#039;t say I ever had any problems at all.<br /><br />Maintenance charges have ballooned recently, as others have stated.<br /><br />I wish that my wife and I didn&#039;t have two dogs, because I would totally look into getting a place there now.&nbsp; For the price you can&#039;t really go wrong and I am used to the neighborhood.<br /><br />My only major complaint would be that the cooperators can be stubborn about things that make no sense.&nbsp; Recently there were plans to install new laundry machines that used magnetic cards rather than quarters.&nbsp; For some reason people were against this and new machines were installed that use quarters.&nbsp; This would be fine if there were change machines in the laundry rooms, but there aren&#039;t, so you have to save all your quarters or go to the bank for change whenever you need to do laundry.&nbsp; I think that many of the older cooperators are just resistant to change and want to keep things going the same old way.<br /><br /><br />

				You would think that all those elderly, widowed ladies who still run Queensview like it was 1955, would want to have a pet as a companion. There is so much research out there that indicates how healthy it is for the elderly to have a pet. I see so many young families moving in there and I wonder what the hell they are thinking. <br /><br />Personally, I would rather live in a postage-sized dump with a pet, than in any place that doesn&#039;t allow them or see the need for having one.

				One thing anyone buying needs to know: Unlike other condos and coops, Queensview board are control freaks, you can&#039;t even sell place on your own, they set price, and take HUGE chunk of any profit.&nbsp; &nbsp;Plus, to move and sell, you must vacate, and keep paying maintenance till place is sold by them.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Subletting must pay double maintenance to sublet.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Queensview 1 bedroom apartments are 770 or so sq feet. Not 600 or 650 as you claim. When they renovate<br />they do the ENTIRE apartment, they do not exclude the kitchen as you claim.

				There are some distinct differences between Queensview and North Queensview.<br /><br />North Queensview is a market rate housing cooperative.&nbsp; There, owners can sell their property for whatever value they deem appropriate.<br /><br />Queensview is a limited equity cooperative.&nbsp; Here, the price of the apartments is controlled by the board.&nbsp; This type of system is used by developers who wish to create affordable housing but still allow people to own equity in their homes.&nbsp; The issue of switching to open market went up for vote several years ago and was voted down, so the situation there is not likely to change any time soon.<br /><br />Most, if not all co-ops take a &quot;flip tax&quot; when you sell your apartment.&nbsp; This is not limited to the Queensviews.&nbsp; This flip tax is used to renovate the apartment when the owner vacates it.<br /><br />North Queensview and Queensview&#039;s apartments differ in some important ways, at least in the 3BR layout.&nbsp; In North Queensview, the kitchen is walkthrough and open on one side to the dining room.&nbsp; In Queensview, the dining room is right when you walk into the apartment.&nbsp; Queensview buildings 13 and 14 3BR apartments share the same layout as North Queensview apartments.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />North Queensview apartments (at least that have not been renovated by their owners) do not have wood floors.&nbsp; They have this vinyl-ish sort of tile. <br /><br />Queensview basically does a complete renovation of apartments.<br />North Queensview only plasters, primes, re-grouts the tile and re-wires the apartment for circuit breakers if it still has the original fuse box and wiring.&nbsp; Any other renovations - new kitchen cabinets, bathroom, floor, etc. are the responsibility of the owners.<br /><br />The maintenance in North Queensview is lower than in Queensview. <br /><br />Neither cooperative has submetering, so maintenance includes &quot;unlimited&quot; utilities - gas, heat, hot water, electric. In North Queensview any new appliances must be energy star compliant; I am not sure about Queensview.<br /><br />I would say the apartments are pretty substantial in size.&nbsp; A 3br apartment is about 1100 sq ft with closets.&nbsp; Unless you horde tons of crap, they are a really good size.<br /><br />Both cooperatives have minimum income requirements, but they are not that high.<br /><br />The neighborhood is pretty quiet.&nbsp; I would say Broadway is nicer now than it has ever been with a lot of new restaurants and lounges and stuff. <br /><br />Apartments on the upper floors do provide pretty nice views.<br /><br />Queensview has recently been giving away a seemingly unlimited amount of reserved handicapped spots in their lots.&nbsp; Queensview basically sells an unlimited amount of parking stickers and works on a first come, first serve basis.&nbsp; But since they have given out so many reserved spots, it has significantly decreased the overall number of available spots.<br /><br />North Queensview has a parking lottery each year.&nbsp; If you are picked in the lottery you are given an assigned spot that is yours for the entire year.&nbsp; Residents that spend part of the year in Florida or warmer climates must surrender their parking spots when they leave.<br /><br />Queensview does not allow dogs, but you can have 1 or 2 cats, I forget.<br />North Queensview allows one dog or two cats, I believe.

However, because queensview and not the previous owner sells the apartment there&#039;s some weird loophole that makes the buyer pay it. I just bought in Aug 09 and my bank messed up the forms at closing and we had to get new ones faxed to us, so if you aren&#039;t done closing you may want to remind your bank of this so they can fill the forms out correctly.

The sense I get from the older people who live here is that they are very very proud of the fact that they continue to &quot;pay it forward&quot; and give other people the same opportunity they were given.

				The open market question is interesting. When my mother passed away in the early eighties my brother and I had to dispose of her 5 1/2 room apt.&nbsp; We debated over trying to hang on to it, but we were both living out of state by then and there was a one year limit on sub-lets (of course there were some illegal sublets being done). We were also told that if the apt. hadn&#039;t been specifically left to us in her will it would go back to the co-op! For those interested in history, the monthly maint. fee at the time was in the three hundreds. I forget if we received 5 or 10 thousand for it but is wasn&#039;t more than that. You didn&#039;t pay 25% to Queensview but you were responsible for restoring the apartment to its original condition when you sold.&nbsp; Do sellers make money if the price increases between the time they buy and sell or does the co-op just charge the new buyer more?
