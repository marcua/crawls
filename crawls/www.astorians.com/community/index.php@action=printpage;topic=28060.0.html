				My boyfriend and I are considering moving into an apartment around 23rd street and 31st Avenue. Is this a safe area? It looks relatively nice and quiet and close to both 30th Avenue and Broadway. I currently live near the Bohemian Beer hall and I feel that area is quite safe, but I am unfamiliar with this area of Astoria. Thoughts?

				I live 2 blocks away, and yes it&#039;s nice.&nbsp; Primarily residential but still on the &quot;good side&quot; of 21st Street.&nbsp; One block away on Broadway is a mini-mall with a supermarket, post office, Rite Aid, Chase, a very good Venezuelan restaurant, and a terrific diner.

				It is a nice, quiet area.&nbsp; Good proximity to shops on Broadway and 30th Ave., as well as the shopping center on 21st St. mentioned by another poster (unfortunately the White Castle just moved out recently, though some may be happy about that; I personally like the pizza restaurant, Samaria, in that center).&nbsp; It does get very quiet at night, so if one or both of you will be coming and going at night and don&#039;t like quiet streets, then I would certainly consider that.&nbsp; Better yet, visit the area at night and see how you feel.
