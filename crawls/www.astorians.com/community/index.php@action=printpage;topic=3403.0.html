				Just got this email now for a free movie screening. Hope someone can use it.<br /><br /><strong>Borat</strong> <br />Wednesday, Sept. 27, 2006<br />at 7:00 PM in Lower Manhattan<br /><br />Synopsis: In Borat, Sacha Baron Cohen - star of HBO&#39;s hit comedy &quot;Da Ali G Show&quot;, takes his outrageous Kazakhstani reporter character Borat to the big screen. In this hilariously offensive movie, Borat travels from his primitive home in Kazakhstan to the U.S. to make a documentary. On his cross-country road-trip, Borat meets real people in real situations with hysterical consequences. <br /><br />http://www.thecinemasource.com/exclusives/borat/

				Old topic.<br /><br />I just saw the movie Borat.&nbsp; I needed low calorie brain candy, so I watched the whole thing, waiting for something funny to happen.&nbsp; It just never came.&nbsp; Frankly, it became painful to watch at times.&nbsp; It seemed hackneyed and it was really just the same joke over and over again.&nbsp; Given the way the movie critics and most of my friends raved about it, how far out of the loop must I be?&nbsp; &nbsp;I haven&#039;t met anyone who hasn&#039;t though it was hysterical.&nbsp;

				It&#039;s a classic case of something being over-hyped to the point where you couldn&#039;t possibly think it was funny.&nbsp; <br /><br />The way my friends described Old School, I though I would need to be put on oxygen to survive the funniness.&nbsp; It was the funny movie to end all funny movies, I was told.&nbsp; When you watch it, Jesus himself comes down and tickles you until you laugh.&nbsp; I finally saw it WAY too late and was majorly disappointed because it was way over-hyped.&nbsp; <br /><br />Try watching Borat after a few beers with a roomful of friends.&nbsp; I might grow on you.&nbsp; Or, it might be too late.&nbsp;

				It&#039;s definitely over-hyped, and it&#039;s a certain type of humor.&nbsp; I felt the same way about Old School and I hated Pulp Fiction.&nbsp; Old School was way over-hyped and turned out to be stereotypical fratboy girltoy potty humor.&nbsp; Pulp Fiction was all hype and violence/spectaclel, but lacking in the story department.&nbsp; And since I&#039;m not a fan of gore and violence, the story would have had to make up for it.&nbsp; People hype up movies so much sometimes, that you go in with all these expectations, and it ends up being a letdown because you set the bar too high.

				Umm.. whole point of Pulp Fiction was that violence is not to be glorified. I don&#039;t care for Saw or Hostel, but those are slasher flicks where violence is the point. Pulp Fiction isn&#039;t like that and it&#039;s fine for you to not like the movie, but you really missed something in the film if you think it&#039;s glorifying violence.

				<em>Talledega Nights</em> definitely had moments of brilliance. And possibly subversive too, because I believe Will Farrell played his role in imitation of George W.

Neither did my husband and he was the one that rented it. <br /><br />I will have to check out Talladega Nights. I like Will Ferrell a lot.&nbsp; I chuckled a bit at&nbsp; Reno 911.
