				I&#039;m without health insurance at the moment, so i really don&#039;t need Dr Fancy Schmany Pants but for the past week ever since I choked on some vitamins, I&#039;ve had this pesky feeling that something is caught in my throat. Normally, I&#039;m not a hypochondriac and it wouldn&#039;t bother me so much, but hubby&#039;s mom had this feeling for a while before she found out she had throat cancer. Now, I&#039;m not sayin I&#039;m freaking out about it, but it does have him concerned since it has been a week, and if a vitamin was hanging on, it would have dissolved by now. Mostly I&#039;m irritated. I could wait until I have health insurance again, but i don&#039;t know when i will be working full time again. So I&#039;m hoping to find a reasonably priced doctor, who could check my throat and tell me I&#039;m ok and what not and hopefully if necessary be cool with a payment plan. I have a feeling I may need another sonnagram (had one for my lymph nodes a few months ago that came back all clear, just naturally large nodes). Without insurance that&#039;s sure to be costly. Anyhoo anyone have anyone they can recommed? I have nothing but time so I can always do the legwork myself of what it will cost me sans insurance.<br /><br />Watch...the day of or the day after I finally see a doctor the feeling will just go away.<br /><br />Does anyone think I <em>should </em> be worried?

				I would warn you that if you think you&#039;ll have a job where you will get health insurance sometime in the relatively near future, you might want to wait.<br /><br />It would suck to get screwed on something serious because it would be considered &quot;pre-existing&quot;.
