				Hiram Monserrate apparently has petitions out to get on the ballot for AD 39:<br /><br />http://capitaltonight.com/2010/06/monserrate-circulating-petitions-for-peraltas-old-seat/<br /><br />I know that&#039;s not in Astoria, but I think all of us in Queens have a vested interest in keeping this woman-beating, anti-gay scum out of Queens government.<br /><br />To review:<br /><br />On June 8, 2009, Monserrate and Pedro Espada formed a coalition with the Senate Republicans in the famous June Senate Coup resulting in the 2009 Senate Leadership Crisis that deadlocked the government.<br /><br />On December 2, 2009, Monserrate voted against legislation allowing same-sex marriage, which failed to pass the Senate.<br /><br />On December 19, 2008, Monserrate was arrested for slashing his girlfriend in the face with a broken drinking glass.<br /><br />And then there&#039;s this: http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2009/09/22/2009-09-22_security_videos_show_queens_pol_hiram_monserrate_dragging_his_bleeding_girlfrien.html#ooid=13Y2Z5OlMPPtwSb4btfIcF-uQYsWY2m6<br /><br />I <em>strongly</em> urge everyone who can to please support Francisco Moya for AD 39: https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/entity/24370

				I couldn&#039;t agree more with MJM on this.&nbsp; If you want to help with petitioning for Moya, please direct message me, and I will connect you with the folks doing that in Jackson Heights.<br /><br />For those who are active supporters of marriage equality, it should be emphasized that not only did Hiram vote against us, he led everyone to believe he was going to vote for us.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Additionally, it should be noted that during the election to replace him, in which now Senator Jose Peralta won, Hiram was visiting polling places the day of followed by mobile signs telling folks to vote for him--something against the law (Candidates are limited to how close they can solicit folks at polling places).&nbsp; <br /><br />If you are interested in how the folks in Jackson Heights and surrounding areas feel, I encourage you to look at the threads on the Astorians sister board for Jackson Heights, accessible from the bottom of the main Astorians page.

				Here&#039;s the Jackson Heights Life thread about the AD 39 Race:<br /><br />http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=4363.0<br /><br />Full disclosure: I was a fan of Bryan Pu-Folkes for this seat. But Bryan clearly saw Monserrate&#039;s return coming and had the integrity to stand with Francisco Moya to unite the Party against the Slasher.

				I got Moya&#039;s email today - Moyamentum - very cute tagline.&nbsp; He&#039;s going to be a great Assemblymember.&nbsp; We need to work hard to keep Hiram from coming back.<br /><br />What Diaz, Sr. did re: GENDA was nothing short of appalling, though expected.&nbsp; I find it very hard to understand how the two Republican supporters of the bill on the committee could shank us yet again, not exactly profiles in courage or people who have any integrity at all.

				Danny you are right&nbsp; the reason i am pissed at these 3 senators is they dont listen to there voters by refusing to vote for marriage equality and what they did to my democractic party to get there way they held us all hostages.DIAZ SR&nbsp; plays that religious bs in albany but politics and religion should be separate.
