				The design of these banks is best exemplified by TB Bank - no Plexiglas shields, not real barriers to limit 30-something thugs from vaulting over the front counter (if there is one) and getting the goods.&nbsp; Remember Washington Mutual with those inane pedestal desks that basically put the customer one-on-one with the &quot;teller?&quot;&nbsp; Wamu felt so little like a bank I think that helped speed it&#039;s demise. The old imagery of monetary safety at banks has been tarnished both because their business practices have become so shoody at the same time they&#039;ve tried not to appear like traditional banks.

				Banks would rather take the loss than have security guards which might cause the robbers to have a confrontation leading to a shooting of a customer . That would mean huge huge lawsuits .&nbsp; Bank money is insured regardless so who cares , just as long as no one gets hurt . <br /><br />I used to work for one of the biggest banks for a long time and that was always the case ,&nbsp; no guards ever for that reason .&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />The glass also isnt bulletproof , its bullet 100% resistant , meaning the bullet might go thru at an angle but also might not&nbsp; .It aslo depends alot on the firearm used . Wont stop a large caliber round .&nbsp; I was told that from the head of security in that bank .&nbsp; Another possible outcome might be that the bullet could ricochet and hit someone else .&nbsp; Better to just give up the money .
