				A really good quality Chinese restaurant could do well in Astoria, something beyond a take-out store, or uninspired food mill.<br /><br />I do get food from Happy Family on Ditmars, and their stuff can be pretty good.&nbsp; Nice people too.

				Thanks so much.&nbsp; The place looks very nice.&nbsp; So I had the impression that they might deliver but that it would be more of a process (time) than a small take-out place.&nbsp; But the menu looks great.&nbsp; I think we&#039;ll try it in person and then go the next step.&nbsp; And soon.&nbsp; We&#039;ve been meaning to for a long time.

				Nuevo Jardin de China is the best option by far! &nbsp;After living in Astoria for years, my husband and I can&#039;t believe that it took us so long to eat there. &nbsp;They definitely deliver to the Ditmars area and you&#039;ll be very happy when you get the food. &nbsp;The funny thing is that you get bread with your order because it&#039;s also a Latin restaurant. We end up freezing the bread for when we&#039;re having pasta for dinner. &nbsp;<br />The meat is very high quality because they use the same meat for their steaks. <br />I&#039;m hungry just thinking about it!!

				I surprised no one has said to check one of the other 5 bazigagillion other threads on this topic.<br /><br />I recommend Golden Kitchen on Astoria Blvd and 29th St.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never been to Nuevo Jardin de China, but have heard it&#039;s good.&nbsp; It also appears to be very expensive compared to the delivery Chinese places around.&nbsp; I also question whether they would deliver to Ditmars and Steinway.&nbsp; Anyone know their delivery range?

				I live on Ditmars &amp; 21st Street and they deliver to me all the time.<br />They are more expensive, yes, but the quality is much greater.&nbsp; Plus we usually get at least 2 meals from it.

				We might be the only people that think so, but my partner and I both LOVE Golden Chopsticks on Ditmars and.. 37th? I think? As far as cheap, take out Chinese goes, it&#039;s honestly the best I&#039;ve had in New York, and I&#039;ve tried many a Chinese place. It&#039;s greasy, and not necessarily authentic, restaurant quality Chinese, but I think it&#039;s delicious. Especially the broccoli with garlic sauce. Mmmm.

				Happy Garden?<br /><br />Happy Gathering on 34th ave / 33rd st is the best standard take-out/delivery Chinese I&#039;ve had in the Broadway/Steinway area... not that they&#039;ll deliver to Ditmars.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t tried Nueva Jardin though.<br /><br />King Garden on 34th ave / 43rd st is a chinese/japenese restaurant, and they do japanese take-out really really well... I&#039;d highly recommend them.&nbsp; Every single other Chinese restaurant on Broadway or Steinway (36th ave-30th ave) are horrible in my opinion.
