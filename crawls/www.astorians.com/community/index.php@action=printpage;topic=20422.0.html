				On my walk to the train on Friday, I counted eleven different piles of dog s___ on 45th between 30th ave and Newtown. It is absolutely disgusting. The worst is always by that white building on the north side of 45th at 31st ave.

				Many dog owners are using the bad weather as an excuse not to clean up after their dog. Owning a dog comes with responsibilities, and cleaning up after your dog means you&#039;re respectful of the law and of your neighbors. It&#039;s bad enough I have to shovel all that snow, I shouldn&#039;t have to clean up after someone&#039;s dog too.

				It is gross. I am a dog owner and I see it everywhere and tons more in the last month or so. I always pick it up, for a variety of reasons - because it is the law, because I would feel guilty not to, and I don&#039;t want anyone stepping in my&nbsp; dog&#039;s sh*t!!

				Seems like we aren&#039;t the only ones disgusted with lazy dog owners.<br /><br />http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/02/17/2011-02-17_time_to_make_rude_pet_owners_feel_like_poop_for_fouling_sidewalks_and_not_cleani.html<br /><br />&quot;The mayor of the Israeli town of Petah Tikva experienced similar frustration enforcing its pooper scooper law. He then embarked on building a DNA database of the town&#039;s dogs. Unscooped poop was tested and the owner identified. The cost of a test was more than covered by the resulting fine.<br />&nbsp; Even the City of New York might be able to perpetuate such a program. And not even the ACLU is likely to argue that a doggie DNA database would violate canine civil rights.<br />&nbsp; At the very least, we should change the punishment for the one or two creeps a week who are caught to include a considerable period of community service cleaning up the poops other creeps failed to scoop.<br />&nbsp; A violator should have to wear a vest marked POOPER SCOOPER. The verbal abuse he would surely suffer might prove to be an actual deterrent.&quot;<br />
