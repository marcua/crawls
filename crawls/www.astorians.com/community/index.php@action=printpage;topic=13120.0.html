				I can personally vouch for Elena and her tailor shop. I had a truly hideous non-fitting bridesmaid dress with about 80 layers of chiffon and took it in to her. After a couple of fittings I picked it up and it looked and fit beautifully.<br />

				&nbsp;:mrgreen: I have had a great experience as well. I had a few steals that I got from Theory and Rag &amp; Bone sample sales and have had a couple of horrible experiences with Astoria tailors, so I wanted someone better. <br /><br />Elena was kind and talkative. After gushing over the materials of the things I brought and the quality of the Rag &amp; Bone craftsmanship, she marked them up and a few days later I had great results.

				Thats interesting, I&#039;ve gone to the older Greek guy that has a shop on 35th st. just north of 30th ave.&nbsp; He&#039;s cheap and good, but his English is lacking and I&#039;m always concerned that he&#039;s not quite understanding what I want.<br />

				She did great work for me too.&nbsp; A couple of dresses, one was a bridesmaids dress that I thought would be awful.&nbsp; She actually called me back in the next day because she thought she could get a better fitting with a different bra. The fit ended up being fantastic.

				I know I&#039;ve touted her before on Astorians, but I just wanted to reiterate how much I adore Elena and her excellent work.&nbsp; She&#039;s done some pretty tricky alterations for me, including my wedding dress. She even sent me down to a fabric store to find just the right material and color to make a shawl that complimented my dress perfectly.&nbsp; It&#039;s still one of my favorite formal outfits. <br /><br />
