				Hey all <br /><br />I stopped in to this place the other night - and I was really impressed by real honest to good ORGANIC food.&nbsp; (unlike some of the new places that advertise it - but don&#039;t really carry it) both fresh produce and packaged goods.&nbsp; They&#039;re still building the place and stocking the shelves - but it&#039;s worth a stop esp if you&#039;re near the Steinway street Corridor.&nbsp; That area has been lacking in food market options.&nbsp; <br /><br />Good luck to this place
