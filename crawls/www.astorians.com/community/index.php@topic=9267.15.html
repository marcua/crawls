And although I see your points lanseaux, I think one must take into account the nature of the city. This is the financial capital of the country. This city is very much dependent on the Banking industry for it&#039;s survival. It just so happens that employees of these firms make more than let&#039;s say auto-workers or other manufacturing type jobs, so comapring NYC to the rest of the country just doesnt seem like a fair comparison. It is true as well that far more people want to live here. I have been a queens resident all my life, but the majority of my friends are from out of town, whether LI, Florida, New England, etc. And not many New Yorkers are moving out. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It&#039;s true that it might be unfair to compare NYC to the rest of the country.&nbsp; But at the same time, not every NYC resident is in the banking industry.&nbsp; Yet with rents and cost of living exploding here, I guess I&#039;m feeling as though there is a general lack of concern for the middle class.&nbsp; The city needs more than rich bankers to sustain itself, economically, socially, culturally, etc...<br /><br />Mom and pops can&#039;t survive.&nbsp; In my case, I&#039;m largely concerned about music venues.&nbsp; Smaller venues can&#039;t survive because rent is too expensive.&nbsp; And we sure don&#039;t need more McD&#039;s in this city.&nbsp; The only companies that are able to afford rents in this city are large corporate businesses like fast food restaurants, Olive Garden, Disney, etc...&nbsp; And with that, NYC loses everything that makes it unique.&nbsp; For example, if I go to France, I don&#039;t want to go to Au Ban Pan or Starbucks.&nbsp; If I go to Italy, I don&#039;t want to go to Olive Garden.&nbsp; I want to experience something unique that is exclusive to those places.&nbsp; And by living in NYC, I want to experience the unique beauty of NYC.&nbsp; And as family or private owned business can&#039;t afford to keep shop here, NYC just becomes another middle America, white bread, boring, normal place with no true defining characteristics other than a bunch of rich bankers who work 20 hours a day and then disappear to their $500,000 studios but don&#039;t actually contribute anything to make this city better other than inflate real estate prices (which to most people on this board isn&#039;t a good thing).</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_110300">I think the OP was right, though.&nbsp; This explosive growth in RE has happened EVERYWHERE.&nbsp; I can&#039;t find it now, but I remember running across a NYT article about a co-op complex near 51st street of the E (I think) that was written back in 1997.&nbsp; They were talking about how you the area was becoming more popular, yet you could still get a studio co-op for $20,000.&nbsp; So, curious, I went looking for craigslist ads for something similar and, lo and behold, I saw a studio for sale in the same building.&nbsp; Except, in 2007, they wanted $130k for a studio that needed a renovation.<br /><br />Now, I understand that RE is going to go up.&nbsp; But, seriously, have salaries gone up 6+ times in the last 10 years?&nbsp; For most, they definitely haven&#039;t.&nbsp; It used to be possible for the average person to live in this city, even in Manhattan.&nbsp; <br /><br />There was a similar article in the Queens Gazette from 2000 talking about Pistilli Riverview.&nbsp; Here is a direct quote from the article: &quot;Apartments will range from studios to three-bedroom units. Prices for the co-ops would range from about $90,000 to $275,000. Pistilli said he hoped monthly maintenance fees would&quot; be kept low.&quot;&quot;&nbsp; The prices are nowhere near that and, well, the maintenance fees aren&#039;t low.<br /><a href="http://www.qgazette.com/News/2000/0927/Front_page.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.qgazette.com/News/2000/0927/Front_page.html</a> (the article, for your pleasure)<br /><br />What&#039;s driven these exploding RE prices?&nbsp; People buying homes they can&#039;t afford, far-too-easy loans for everyone, predatory lending practices, and record Wall Street profits that were, oddly enough, made in a large part of selling and packaging these same shoddy loans.<br /><br />This scramble to turn every American into a homebuyer and to make record profits blew most real estate values up astronomically.&nbsp; However, more than that is blowing up.&nbsp; It&#039;s time to pay the piper.<br /><br />As someone else already posted here; everything is in a cycle.&nbsp; Now is the downturn.&nbsp; Easy loans have dried up; big Wall Street banks, all banks, pretty much are posting huge losses; housing values are declining (how many bidding wars and homes selling above asking price have you seen lately?); people are starting to feel the strain of increased prices in food, fuel, and utilities; and layoffs are starting to increase.&nbsp; <br /><br />IMHO, we&#039;re up for a downturn over the next year or two; possibly a very serious one.&nbsp; It&#039;s just my inexpert opinion, of course, but we could very well be setting up for a serious contraction that could bring things back to rational levels.&nbsp; It won&#039;t be pretty; jobs will be lost, and people will be struggling.<br /><br />SOMETHING has to change.&nbsp; The fact that housing has become all but unaffordable for a generation that&#039;s just entering or has only been in the workforce for a few years is unprecedented.&nbsp; But, we&#039;re such a debt-laden society, we&#039;ve been able to survive...barely.<br /><br />I think an entire shift in the way that people look at debt and spending has to change.&nbsp; Never before have we, as a society in general, been so materialistic or irrational about costs.&nbsp; <br /><br />In my opinion, we&#039;re about to be humbled and tested.&nbsp; It&#039;s just my opinion and, hey, I could just be very pessimistic about it.&nbsp; But, that pessimism has helped me reign in my spending and learn to live better within my (pretty meager) means, as well as put away what money I can.&nbsp; If we hit a serious recession; look out.&nbsp; It&#039;ll be rough.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_110320">Incomes based on market competition are inherently moral. People should be paid no more and no less than what other people are willing to pay them. No coercion, no minimums, no maximums. A person has skills or knowledge or something to offer that an employer values at $2 an hour or $20,000 an hour, they consent to work together, everybody wins.&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />Problems arise when incomes are derived independently of a market process. One obvious example, of course, is the income of a dictator. Castro&#039;s net worth is estimated conservatively at one billion dollars. Did he acquire this wealth through a voluntary exchange of values where the other parties had the right NOT to be obliged to compensate him? Ummm, no. He&#039;s able to capture wealth by paying a gang of thugs to systematically oppress people and expropriate their wealth at will. Disgusting. :-P&nbsp; <br /><br />Minimum wage laws distort labor markets by creating an arbitrary floor for wages. The opportunity cost of minimum wage laws are the jobs that are not legally allowed to exist. Which really sucks for extremely low-skilled workers. On the flipside, since the 1980s, there has been a proliferation of anti-hostile takeover legislation at the state legislature level. States are basically competing to offer legal structures that are enticing to businesses. One tragic effect of creating artificial legal barriers to takeover challenges is that corporations become artificially insulated from the competitive culture that is supposed to drive them to innovate, be more productive, more cost-conscious. When there are no repercussions for running a business badly, you get corporate executive boards giving themselves raises/compensation packages that are truly inappropriate. Of course, the problem here is not the amount of any given CEO&#039;s compensation, it&#039;s the incentives created by anti-competitive legislation to &quot;protect&quot; businesses from competition. You can google &quot;regulatory capture&quot; for an other phenomenon that has unintended consequences along the lines of enriching some businesses by creating artificial barriers to entry in different markets.&nbsp; :x<br /><br />A less obvious example comes in the form of government &quot;protecting&quot; industries by imposing tariffs, for example.&nbsp; This means that a domestic producer is going to be able to charge consumers more than would be possible if foreign producers were able to price their goods/services without paying a government fee. Consumers, in effect, are taxed to subsidize businesses. The tax isn&#039;t obvious because it is embedded in the prices of the limited selection of goods available to people in markets that are &quot;protected&quot; by tariffs.&nbsp; <img src="http://www.astorians.com/community/Smileys/SoLoSMiLeYS1/cry.gif" alt="&#58;cry&#58;" title="cry" class="smiley" /><br /><br />*******<br /><br />Give me a government that enforces laws against coercion and fraud vigorously, but otherwise leaves you and me alone. I have no problem with enormous income gaps. Super wealthy people are able to capitalize the kinds of discoveries and radical breakthroughs in technology that eventually make it possible, for example, for people of all income levels to live longer, healthier, more productive, more enjoyable lives. Would you rather be a 25-year-old king in the 15th century Europe or a 25-year-old making $35,000 a year living in NYC in 2008? Who has a better quality of life and whose future is brighter?<br /><br />Relative to people at the same income level in prior centuries and even decades, people at every income level enjoy a higher quality of life over time in a society that has a vital, free market economy. The problems we&#039;re facing now are proportional to the severity of the increasing role of government in our economy.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_110336">Adam, I agree with most of your post in principle.&nbsp; There are times our free market system will produce seemingly obscene inequities, yet for the most part, it results in a higher general prosperity.&nbsp; Cyclical economic trends are an undenable part of the system, yet its a much better option IMO than command economies.&nbsp; There is a danger, however, of the development of a severe inequity of wealth distribution.&nbsp; This pulls the entire system down and results in economic retardation.&nbsp; The Gracchii brothers recognized this and were killed by the moneyed senate, which was in turn done in by the landless citizens who clamoured for an emperor (aways intrigued by the paralels between Rome and America).<br /><br />So I think there do have to be some safeguards against this.&nbsp; I think the rant against bonuses is just populist frustration and its been going on for quite some time.&nbsp; But its just a rant and the middle classes wouldn&#039;t advoate going any farther than just that, for they are too wrapped up in the system to push for any real changes.&nbsp; On the other hand, the lower classes cannot simply be left to the wiles of a free market.&nbsp; Unlike the middle class, they are always in danger of rejecting the system.&nbsp; Minimum wage laws are not economic ones, but social ones like welfare, free medical insurance and the gross imbalance between the taxes acquired from them and the cost of the government services vouchsafed to them.&nbsp; Really just modern day bread and circuses to prevent them from rioting.&nbsp; <br /><br />I also agree with you on the coercion comments, but we do have this in this country.&nbsp; Its a bit more subtle then Castro-like coercion, but its just as prevelant.&nbsp; Wage slavery, or the institution whereby the poor are left with no other option then working for near sustanence wages, is very strong in this country.&nbsp; The middle and upper classes benefit from this immensly, and its much more economical than straight out slavery.<br /><br />Finally, I agree with the comments on tariffs, however, I do see them as a useful tool in allowing a nascent industry to mature to the point where it can compete on its own.&nbsp; As a permanent policy they are destructive, and the English Corn Laws are examples of the worst of the worst.<br /><br />What I am more curious on is how the development of the two family income over the one family income has affected real estate.&nbsp; It seems that today a two income family finds it just as hard to buy a house than a one income family did 30 years ago.&nbsp; How much has the two family income driven up prices?&nbsp; I have no idea but I&#039;d love to see any study which might touch on it.&nbsp; </div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_110371">Hi Frappe. A few thoughts on your response. <br /><br />I&#039;m not sure what to make of your stated agreement with me &quot;on principle&quot; in light of all of your assertions that contradict my basic principle.<br /><br />I wrote: &quot;Incomes based on market competition are inherently moral. People should be paid no more and no less than what other people are willing to pay them. No coercion, no minimums, no maximums. A person has skills or knowledge or something to offer that an employer values at $2 an hour or $20,000 an hour, they consent to work together, everybody wins.&quot;<br /><br />You have asserted that severe inequality of wealth distribution is dangerous. I disagree, profoundly and on principle, because such an assertion is based on an obsolete understanding of wealth. <br /><br />Wealth is not static. There is not a fixed amount of wealth in the world whereby the only way person A is extraordinarily wealthy is by other persons being poorer. Wealth is created by trade, by exchanges of value that profit both parties. You and I sit down together. I trade you a pen I don&#039;t need in exchange for your magazine that you&#039;ve already read. Instantly, we are both wealthier. Wealth creation is a win-win scenario.<br /><br />Rules and regulations that create artificial obstacles to people trading with other people create problems. The people with the least amount to trade are, generally speaking, people with fewer or undeveloped skills, less marketable knowledge, basically, poor people. What they most frequently do have to trade is their willingness to engage in straightforward manual labor. And many such people strive to come to the U.S. because there is a market for their labor here that doesn&#039;t exist in their home countries.<br /><br />Now, I believe fervently that is evil (truly and unforgiveably evil) to interfere with the ability of these people to trade their labor at market rates. People who are not inclined to think seriously about minimum wage laws in terms of their economic impact will insist that they have the moral high ground when they insist that a price floor for labor be legally enforced. But it shouldn&#039;t take anybody long to figure out what happens when a business is told that it is ILLEGAL to hire people below a certain price. Generally speaking, many jobs that would otherwise be offered never get to exist. Of course, some jobs are offered extralegally, in the form of a black market in labor, but these come with the obvious pitfall that some employers gain leverage/power over such employees that does not exist in the &quot;legal&quot; private sector.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Looking at the history of minimum wage laws reveals some interesting things. Who has incentives to pass laws that make it illegal for people to work below a certain price? Think about it. Who gains an advantage by preventing competition for existing jobs? That&#039;s right, people who are already employed. Like, for example, white men in South Africa during Apartheid, or, men in general in the United States during the so-called progressive era who wanted to forestall competition with women. <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~tleonard/papers/Womenswork.pdf" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.princeton.edu/~tleonard/papers/Womenswork.pdf</a> How ironic that (assuming well-intentioned advocates/legislators) the unintended consequence of minimum wage laws is, in essence, unemployment! Of course, when you think about it, the biggest advocates of minimum wage laws are Democrats, who are also the most influenced by Unions. Hmmm.<br /><br />And yet, while less than 10% of the U.S. labor force is unionized, over 96% of the country is paid more than the minimum wage. How to account for the fact that so many businesses who are not FORCED by government legislation end up paying more than the minimum? It&#039;s simple. There are market rates for labor and, generally speaking, employers have to pay what the market demands to attract qualified workers. Would I pay $2 an hour instead of $20 an hour if I could for my freelance help? Of course. But that&#039;s just not possible because of competition. I can&#039;t attract qualified help for less.<br /><br />&quot;Wage slavery.&quot; To describe paying somebody for the value of their labor so derisively is just difficult for me to process. The implication that a person running a business should pay laborers more than the market will bear strikes me as the worst kind of hypocrisy, since at the other end of the spectrum, high wage earners are regularly disparaged for being paid &quot;too much.&quot;&nbsp; And if paying eighty laborers slightly more leads to the unemployment of 20 laborers, is that worth it? By whose standards? And, by the way, who the hell has any right to make this call other than the person whose capital is creating these jobs? A politician? Really? Because his incentives, we&#039;re to believe, will be pure and just?&nbsp; :roll:<br /><br />***<br /><br />Frappe, I appreciate your thoughtful comments, as usual. Though I&#039;m not convinced that we agree on principle at this point, I have hope!&nbsp; :mrgreen:</div>
