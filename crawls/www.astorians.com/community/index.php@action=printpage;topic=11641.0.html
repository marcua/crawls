				If anyone can help me with this dilemma, please let me know.&nbsp; I want to know how I can report a credit card that makes a denial&nbsp; based on past history no longer on a credit report. <br />Years ago I got in trouble with &quot;The Cards&quot; and for many years I payed the price with bad credit.&nbsp; I have since rebuilt my credit and the problems are no longer on my credit report.&nbsp; I have a very high credit score now and I feel I can move on with my life.&nbsp; I recently applied for a card and was denied because of my history in the past with one of my cards.&nbsp; I tried fighting this with everyone at the card company, explaining how they can&#039;t use information no longer in my credit report.&nbsp; Their reply was that it is in their computer and because no one knows how to remove it they will use the old information.&nbsp; I would think this is illegal but I don&#039;t know how to go about fighting this.&nbsp; Any help from my fellow fighters would be great.

				Java<br /><br />I thought that the credit card company had to use the three reporting agencies: Experian, Transunion, or Equifax to pull your report.&nbsp; I don&#039;t understand why they can&#039;t simply run a new report.&nbsp; By the way, how many years ago was your last negative credit hit?&nbsp; It takes normally 7 years to get negative credit off of the report and bankruptcies usually take 10 years.<br /><br />Here is the link to report a complaint to the FTC or the NY State Attorney General:<br /><br />https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/ (You should check out their information about credit reporting)<br /><br />http://www.oag.state.ny.us/complaints/complaints.html<br /><br />I also included the websites for the three national credit reporting agencies; perhaps they can help.<br /><br />http://www.experian.com/credit_report_basics/index.html<br /><br />http://www.transunion.com/<br /><br />http://www.equifax.com/home/<br />

				not sure if it matters, but what&#039;s so special about this particular card?&nbsp; <br /><br />there are a zillion of other credit card companies that would do business with you if your credit history has been cleared up.<br /><br />unless it&#039;s something you GOTTA have, why bother?!

				the reason I want the card, and the only reason, is that they give you your credit score for free all year long.&nbsp; Since you have to pay to get the score, I figured why not get it.&nbsp; Now it is just the principle of the matter.

				Java,<br /><br />Are you referring to the WaMu Real Rewards Visa Platinum (http://www.mycardblog.com/2008/06/wamu-real-rewards-visa-platinum-card)?&nbsp; According to what I&#039;ve read, WaMu has some sort of arrangement with TransUnion that allows them to access their credit scores.&nbsp; As far as I know, the information that WaMu uses comes from TU and is not already in their database.&nbsp; The reason for rejecting your application should be on the letter and it should clearly indicate which agency they used.&nbsp; <br /><br />Of course if you&#039;re not referring to the WaMu, none of the above matters.<br /><br />Sorry, but I&#039;ve been a little bit obsessed about all things dealing with credit or credit history since having my identity stolen and my credit being used to set up a phony business in the Bronx.&nbsp; It&#039;s funny how it took an actual crime for me to really protect my identity.&nbsp; When I got rejected for a crappy retail credit card that seemingly everyone can get, my rejection letter informed me that they were unable to verify my address.&nbsp; That seemed reasonable since I had just moved about a month prior to applying.&nbsp; My current address is now on all of the three credit reporting agencies, along with every address I ever used to apply for credit.

				yes it is the WaMU card.&nbsp; I talked to them and Trans Union.&nbsp; The information they are using to deny me isn&#039;t coming from Trans Union but from their database with Providian.&nbsp; They tell me they have no way to get rid of the Providian info from the computer so they have to use it.&nbsp;

				I am guessing that since WaMu bought Providian, they can&#039;t change the past history in the system.&nbsp; I can understand that totally.&nbsp; What I don&#039;t understand is how they can still use the information.

				Using the three major agencies once a year, the credit report is free, but the credit score is not. In order to obtain that through these companies you need to pay a fee (under $10). It&#039;s easy, though. If you just really want to see what your credit score is, it&#039;s probably worth it for you to spend the money. Otherwise I&#039;m not aware of a truly free way to get it aside from signing up for that credit card JavaJay wants.

				To get a free credit report score from only ONE of the three agencies I recommend www.myfico.com. I think they also let you see your credit reports from all agencies. <br /><br />You need to sign up for a FREE 30-day trial, and as long as you cancel within the time frame you&#039;re not charged anything. I&#039;ve done it along with 4 family members. All for free. No hassle, no problems.<br /><br />Good luck!
