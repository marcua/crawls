			Hello all -<br /><br />Anyone interested in playing in some friendly PU roller hockey games in Astoria, please email me: tmcgonagle19@yahoo.com<br /><br />I&#039;ve been rounding up people on the streets (stopping strangers who are carrying hockey gear) and we&#039;ve got a few people now - all we need is a few more to have a decent, hopefully consistent number.&nbsp; If you&#039;re aware of any already existing PU games, please share as well.<br /><br />Thanks!

			Where would u be playing in astoria ?&nbsp; &nbsp;I know the outdoor rink on 28st and 34 ave is being over run by mexicans playing soccer every weekend and they have destroyed the boards , ripped out the yellow lining which allowed the puck to be whipped around the rink . The people who run or ran the rink now lock up the nets too as they were getting messed up also .&nbsp; &nbsp;I know some hockey players shoot around at hoyt park which is on 29st under the train&nbsp; next to neptune diner and they are always shooting around . Most of the time they dont have a goalie though.

			Location is open to suggestion - it&#039;d be nice to make use of that rink somehow - whether that requires playing weeknights or cleaning it up a bit.&nbsp; Perhaps I can track down a contact to the management of the park.<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard of the games by Hoyt park, perhaps that&#039;s the best starting place.&nbsp; As I said, any and all suggestions are welcome.&nbsp; I personally plan on checking out Hoyt this Saturday AM, and maybe doing some local scouting elsewhere as well.

			Usually people get to hoyt around 1pm or maybe even later . Those late nights rnt easy to get up early from the next day as&nbsp; i know alot of the guys r around there are 21-23 yrs old .&nbsp; I went by there last sunday and it was great to skate around , but the goalie never showed .&nbsp; &nbsp;Only dedicated hockey fans shoot at a garbage can turned on its side :)

			The rink is run by the YMCA is Long Island City (on behalf of the City).&#160; The adjacent school (144 I believe) doesn&#039;t really have anything to do with it.&#160; But I doubt the Y would allow use of the nets for anything other than league games.<br /><br />If more people play hockey there, you&#039;d see less soccer being played there.&#160; Trust me, those guys are harmless, and they certainly wouldn&#039;t mess with a bunch of guys carrying sticks.&#160; All they want to do is play soccer.&#160; But if the rink was actually being used for hockey, they&#039;d just look to play elsewhere.&#160; <br /><br />Heck, a few of them may probably end up watching.&#160; When I would play league games there, you&#039;d be surprised at the size of the Latin crowd who just stood around and watched.&#160; Remember, it&#039;s basically just soccer with skates and sticks.&#160; Not that difficult to follow along.<br /><br />The funny part was, since I&#039;m Latin, they would be kinda surprised to see me play as well.&nbsp; I&#039;d often get some puzzling looks after I took off my skates and walked home.&nbsp; But then again, as the only Brown person with equpment on, I should have expected them to be a little taken aback by me.
