The film did in fact discuss the military, and showed several lists that were obtained of &quot;african american only&quot; military who we purged from system even though they were legal registered voters. As for illegals aliens voting, that&#039;s less likely to happen than even legalized residents, who can&#039;t vote either. Voter fraud is not a rampant problem, but election fraud is. <br /><br />Exit polls were accurate for over 40 years, and used as a gage used to keep check on whether something fishy was going on with the actual election results. The fact that there has been a soaring discrepancy between exit polls and official voting count since 1996 should have everyone concerned, including FZ. Remember, the ends do not justify the means when it comes to voting in a democracy. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><br />Well, you automatically believe&nbsp; Bush and Republicans&nbsp; are frauds, evil, criminals and liars and the Left is this monolith of virtue who produce flowery documentaries&nbsp; that reveal truth? Now, that we got that out of the way, let&#039;s&nbsp; look at voter fraud&nbsp; vs. election fraud. :-)<br /><br />You assume I don&#039;t know anything about it. I have spent 12 years working elections, city, state and federal.&nbsp; I read reviews&nbsp; about this so-called documentary, who praised it, looked&nbsp; at the &#039;interview&#039; list and it was the usual suspects that call anything won by Republicans or Non-Leftists fraud, stealing. <br /><br />It is telling that&nbsp; they include the usual charge of &#039;racism&#039;, instead of focusing on some&nbsp; malarkey about some &#039;African American&#039; list, what they didn&#039;t ask for a list of &#039;spanish-sounding&#039; names?&nbsp; <img src="http://www.astorians.com/community/Smileys/SoLoSMiLeYS1/wink.gif" alt="&#58;wink&#58;" title="wink" class="smiley" /> Thanks for&nbsp; confirming who and what is&nbsp; behind&nbsp; this nonsense. Felons&nbsp; voting was looked&nbsp; into in Florida, and only&nbsp; 8, count them, 8 were found to be registered&nbsp; &#039;legit&#039; voters. Some happened&nbsp; to be&nbsp; African American and had served&nbsp; in the Military,but, were felons. The NYT, no &#039;right-wing&#039;&nbsp; arm of the dreaded&nbsp; FOX News, looked at extensive studies&nbsp; of both Govt and civilian agencies and found even with over votes and mistakes the outcome would be the same. <br /><br />I wonder, did they include, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel which initiated an investigation of the 2004 presidential election in Wisconsin, which had one of the closest results, with Kerry winning the state by only 11,000 votes. The newspaper investigation resulted in a probe by U.S. Attorney Steve Biskupic and Milwaukee County District Attorney E. Michael McCann that found clear evidence of fraud in the election, including more than 200 felons who voted illegally and another 100-plus people who voted under bad addresses or false names or who voted twice. You know the rampant voter fraud&nbsp; that doesn&#039;t exist? One of the most comprehensive studies of the 2000 presidential election, &#039;Democracy Held Hostage,&#039; was conducted by the Miami Herald ,it found that 400 votes were cast illegally in heavily Democratic Broward County when poll workers allowed voters to vote who were not on the precinct voting rolls. And another 452 were cast illegally by felons in Broward. In Volusia County -- which supported Gore -- 277 voters voted who were not registered, including 73 voters at predominately black Bethune-Cookman University, which voted heavily for Gore. Not to mention the tactics of ACORN, who when questioned about voter fraud in minority communities&nbsp; just shout &#039;racism&#039; knowing that the &#039;unbiased&#039; press&nbsp; will join in so no inquiry can be made to&nbsp; investigate the&nbsp; rampant voter&nbsp; fraud in large cities by democrat&nbsp; machine&nbsp; organizations.<br /><br />The Herald review of votes in 22 counties (with 2.3 million ballots) found that 1,241 ballots were cast illegally by felons who had not received clemency. Of these voters, 75% were registered Democrats. And the Herald study counted only those who had been sentenced to prison for more than a year.<br /><br />One of the most recent well-publicized voter fraud cases occurred in the Washington State governor’s race in November 2004 in which Democrat Christine Gregoire allegedly defeated Republican Dino Rossi by 129 votes after weeks of vote counting. The Washington State Superior Court found that 1,400 felons voted illegally, along with illegal votes cast by 53 dead people, two non-citizens and 27 double votes. Since Washington State does not have party voter registration, there was no way of proving exactly how they voted, so the judge ruled there was not enough proof to void the election.<br /><br /><br />There&nbsp; were extensive studies&nbsp; done by news media and govt. and besides human error that has happened&nbsp; for all time, there was no more extensive&nbsp; irregularties&nbsp; than any other election, the main cases&nbsp; of fraud&nbsp; were on the registration and permitting of&nbsp; Illegals&nbsp; and voters who were nonexistent and the majority of those&nbsp; were done in cities run by democrats, where they would drive busloads&nbsp; to polls with no ID, or as in the case of Former Gov. Spitzer, giving illegals&nbsp; license&nbsp; ID&#039;s, all in the name of being &#039;fair.&#039; <br /><br />Yeah, I&#039;m concerned&nbsp; at the way people like me are knocked&nbsp; about the head&nbsp; and ripped&nbsp; off, by so-called&nbsp; documentaries and folks who aren;t&nbsp; concerned&nbsp; with any &#039;election fraud&#039;, but, hiding the extensive&nbsp; voter&nbsp; fraud&nbsp; behind&nbsp; charges of &#039;racism&#039; and &#039;disenfranchisement&#039; every time someone tries&nbsp; to investigate it. What happened&nbsp; in 2006? Well, Democrats &#039;won&#039;, no fraud there, right?&nbsp; :roll:<br /><br />Oh Yeah, Exist Polls&nbsp; are always&nbsp; spot on, especially&nbsp; in close elections for President. <img src="http://www.astorians.com/community/Smileys/SoLoSMiLeYS1/wink.gif" alt="&#58;wink&#58;" title="wink" class="smiley" /><br /><br /><img src="http://i185.photobucket.com/albums/x96/FZ81/image.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_145159">FZ, since you worked in elections, you know the difference between polling people before an election and polling people after they voted (exit polling). The Truman/Dewey headline relied on the former, as there was no nationwide exit polling being done back in 1948. The Obama and McCain polls will continue to fluctuate until Election Day. Exit polls were always spot on with almost no exceptions, until recently. As for voter fraud, I recall having read about the examples you gave, and I agree they should have been prosecuted. <br /><br />Again, the big problem isn&#039;t voter fraud, it&#039;s election fraud. Why are there almost no indictments let alone convictions on election fraud? Because it&#039;s being done by insiders who leave no clues as to what they have done in the computers. Scripted codes can disappear after they are run, leaving no trace, let alone a paper trail. In Ohio in 2004, because of overwhelming evidence of election fraud, a judge gave a court order to have all the voting results saved and sealed for a possible recount, and yet 70% of them were lost or destroyed. Oops, no way to have a recount now is there? A former Diebold programmer was approached by a Republican official and requested tyo write a code that would flip votes after the polls closed. He reported the information to the FBI and the DOJ. It didn&#039;t matter, since they obviously got other programmers to do the job anyway. The voting servers went down and were blacked out just as the polls closed on Ohio with Kerry leading 51% to Bush 48%. A few hours later when the servers were back up, the percentages flipped. Cute, huh?<br /><br /></div>

There was no fraud in Cuyahoga County, Ohio where the number of recorded votes was more than 93,000 larger than the number of registered voters and where they admitted counting the votes in secret before bringing them out in public to count.<br /><br />14. CNN reported at 9 p.m. EST on election evening that Kerry was leading by 3 points in the national exit polls based on well over 13,000 respondents. Several hours later at 1:36 a.m. CNN reported that the exit polls, now based on a few hundred more-13,531 respondents were showing Bush leading by 2 points, a 5-point swing. In other words, a swing of 5 percentage points from a tiny increase in the number of respondents somehow occurred despite it being mathematically impossible.&quot;<br /></div>

Acorn&#039;s only crime is registering Democratic voters.<br /><br />Barack Obama and the Democrats are stealing the election. Massive voter fraud is being carried out, even as we speak, by their henchmen, known by the innocuous sounding Association for Community Organisations for Reform Now, or Acorn. Clever bastards.<br /><br />The only problem? Despite the screaming wall-to-wall coverage of &quot;Democratic voter fraud in 11 swing states&quot; as seen on Fox News and even the once-respectable CNN, none of it&#039;s true. None of it.<br /><br />In just the last week, we&#039;ve had a phoney stunt raid in swing state Nevada (where Acorn had been cooperating with officials for months, concerning problem canvassers they&#039;d long ago fired); a Republican election official in swing state Missouri tell Fox News that she&#039;s being beseiged with fraudulent registration forms from Acorn (in a county where they&#039;ve not done any registration work since August); a Republican sheriff in swing state Ohio, who, the very next day, suddenly requested the names and addresses of hundreds of early voters (with evidence of exactly zero wrong doing, but lots of Democratic-leaning college student in the particular county, and John McCain&#039;s state campaign chair as a partner in the investigation); and a screaming front page headline in Rupert Murdoch&#039;s New York Post about a guy who claims he was somehow tricked by Acorn into registering 72 times (but read the article closely to note he says he registered at the same address each time, which, even if true, would allow him - you guessed it - precisely one legal vote.)<br /><br />It&#039;s an old Republican scam, but it&#039;s never been carried out with more zeal than this year. The Republicans have been putting so much time, money and resources into the propaganda leading up to this over the last four years, we should have expected no less. <br /><br />.............................................<br /><br />It&#039;s an old shell game, the Republicans are making you concentrate on bogus claims of voter fraud, while they try to steal the election with a system wide network of election fraud.
