				Yeah, I don&#039;t like the trend either. We stopped in the other day, ordered a burger. I don&#039;t know if it was just that particular day, but Bonnie&#039;s burger was smaller than Sweet Afton&#039;s. And the bun was ice cold. Another thing I don&#039;t like about both establishments is that you have to order bacon, onions, etc... separate and are charged extra. I&#039;m glad Bareburger is just up the street.

				If you don&#039;t like the burger, you don&#039;t like the burger but in terms of fries, don&#039;t most burger places charge separately for burger and fries, including Bareburger and Sweet Afton&#039;s? <br /><br /><br />Mike&#039;s Diner charges around $10 for a cheeseburger deluxe, or an extra $2.50 for <span style="font-family: Verdana;" class="bbc_font">french fries, lettuce, tomato, coleslaw, onion rings and pickle -- enjoy.</span><br /><br />

				That&#039;s why we always sit at the bar when we can squeeze in-much better service from the bartenders.<span style="font-family: verdana;" class="bbc_font">The highlight of my visit to Bonnie&#039;s was the Founder&#039;s Porter. The seafood pot pie was small for $15.00, and kind of bland. </span>Bareburger&#039;s Standard is 9.85 (with all the trimmings) and a side of rings and fries $4.70. Fries alone is $2.80.<br /><br /><br />I think it&#039;s funny Bonnie is having a Superbowl party on Feb 1st with (drumroll please) 2 big screen TV&#039;s. I thought the owner of Sweet Afton was anti-TV. Now THAT might be disturbing for their regular customers.<br /><br />

				I have only been to The Bonnie on one occasion, but I was treated well and felt at home.&nbsp; I sat at the back bar, and ordered a couple of appetizers and drafts.&nbsp; The bartender could not have been nicer, took his time with me, and offered samples of unfamiliar beers, even though the restaurant was packed.&nbsp; Although I think the price point is slightly high for the neighborhood, I don&#039;t think it is outrageous.&nbsp; When I want a decent burger, I order from Tasty&#039;s.&nbsp; When I want a decent burger, a well-curated beer menu, attentive staff and lovely atmosphere, I will return to The Bonnie.

				Another disturbing trend - brunch without any drinks included, not even coffee.<br /><br />But lets face it - it&#039;s not really disturbing. We&#039;ve all observed it ever since we were old enough to understand economics. Just another way to disguise the impact of inflation.<br /><br />I have fond memories as a child of eating a chocolate bar called Yorkie (in the UK). It was marketed as &quot;not for girls&quot; because the pieces of chocolate were so chunky and manly (haha). Anyway, the bar contained 6 pieces, each with a letter of the name Y.O.R.K.I.E.&nbsp; Think of my shock and dismay when one day I opened the bar and there were only five pieces and no letters on each piece.&nbsp; I wonder how small it has become now - suitable for women perhaps? LOL!.
