				DON&#039;T DO IT!!!<br /><br />hahaha i kid i kid. i have worked for NBC for almost 10 years and its alright i guess. the page program used to be really cool and fun, i haven&#039;t really had much contact with it the past few years but i&#039;m sure its still alright. i also lost all my connections over there :(<br />there really is nothing i could say other then just treat it like any other job interview. they need responsible enthusiastic people. pages get alot of assignements with the higher ups and important people and celebs so they don&#039;t want any crack pots doing it. they do get alot of crap work though for sure- but at least they get paid unlike poor interns!<br /><br />good luck :)

				Thanks so much. I am almost 30 (and yes a recent college graduate) and therefore am a bit older than most Pages I am sure, so already feel at a disadvantage, but perhaps not being that I have a lot of work experience. I guess your advice about treating it like any other job interview is the way to go. Thanks again!

				I had a co-worker who started out as a page.&nbsp; Eventually he made his way over to the Insomniac show, then back to NBC to be a writers apprentice on SNL, now he&#039;s on 30 Rock.&nbsp; You can see him once in a while, he plays the bald very white guy who sometimes sits at the writers&#039; table and gets no lines but an occasional goofy look.<br /><br />The TV industry is all about people who can put in long hours for little pay and be good at it, that&#039;s the best way to move up.
