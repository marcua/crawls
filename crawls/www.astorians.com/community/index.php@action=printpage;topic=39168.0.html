				On Saturday night I decided to try this restaurant for dinner and I had a very disappointing experience.&nbsp; First of all when my friend and I walked in the noise level in there was extremely high.&nbsp; They had loud music playing and I don&#039;t even know what kind of annoying music it was. It sounded like rock and not mexican.&nbsp; Well they sat us at a small table for 2 which was part of a table for 4 which they pulled slightly to the side, so we felt like we were sitting at the same table as the couple next to us.&nbsp; Another annoying thing was that the waitress kept squeezing behind my chair to get to the other table and she kept pushing my chair.&nbsp; Well, besides all of that the portion sizes are very small.&nbsp; My friend got salmon which is one of the more expensive things on the menu and it was such a small piece of salmon I couldn&#039;t believe it.&nbsp; Also she didnt&#039; get any vegetable or salad with it. <br /><br />Well we were eating our food and a different waitress asked us to move over because she coudn&#039;t get by so we moved our table since the people sitting next to us had moved and then a short while after that they told us to once again move our table so they could seat someone at teh table next to us. At that point we were totally fed up so my friend told the waitress to give us teh check and we left. <br /><br />I will never go back to this restaurant.&nbsp; They are trying to squeeze too many people into a small space.&nbsp; It was very uncomfortable. I know I already said it, but I will NEVER GO BACK TO THIS RESTAURANT OR RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE

				I am looking on Yelp right now and most of the reviews are very bad.&nbsp; So I see that I&#039;m not the only one.&nbsp; If they don&#039;t make some changes I don;t think they will be around for long.&nbsp; A lot or reviewers said they would not go back and either will I.

				We went to Two Lizards last night.&nbsp; Braun, I definitely saw some of what you describe but I had a lengthy discussion with their experienced manager (and an Astoria local) and gained a different insight.&nbsp; Two Lizards has been in business on the Upper East Side for a while.&nbsp; They&#039;re experienced but they never expected their soft opening to have people waiting around the block to get in.&nbsp; You&#039;d think everyone who lives near Ditmars has been dying for this place to open.&nbsp; Even last night (a Sunday) it was mobbed, loud, and bustling like a Saturday night.&nbsp; I got the impression there were not prepared to be this busy their first few days.&nbsp; I believe things will shape up fast.&nbsp; From what I was told, they have a lot of intense training taking place on the off hours. We encountered friendly service but it wasn&#039;t super professional.&nbsp; I&#039;ve experienced worse so we rolled with a few minor mistakes.&nbsp; I had the salmon for dinner too.&nbsp; It&nbsp; isn&#039;t a huge portion but it was sufficient for me, and it was fresh and cooked to perfection.&nbsp; It comes with a side and I chose rice and beans.&nbsp; There was plenty.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t finish all of the salmon or the side.&nbsp; Well, maybe because I got the Tamal of the Day as an appetizer.&nbsp; Two large and delicious tamales came to me that were awesome.&nbsp; My wife got the marinated roasted pork served with green cilantro rice and plantains.&nbsp; She loved it and it was a huge portion.&nbsp; She stared with a bowl of black bean soup that was also very good.&nbsp; I agree the place felt tightly packed but again, I&#039;ve seen worse.&nbsp; The volume is loud.&nbsp; I think that&#039;s the whole theme here.&nbsp; I predict this place will always be packed.&nbsp; It&#039;s more like Tacuba than Maizal.&nbsp; I think they strive to always have the look and feel of a party.&nbsp; This place can be a lot of fun if that&#039;s what you&#039;re looking for.&nbsp; I can&#039;t wait to go back for a Friday happy hour and enjoy the drinks and the whole experience a little differently.&nbsp; I can only imagine when the summer comes and all the doors are wide open to the street.&nbsp; I really do think their service issues will improve in a short time.&nbsp; The kitchen seems in great shape now.&nbsp; Hey - I&#039;m not a fan of MP but they&#039;re pretty crowded all the time.&nbsp; Two Lizards may not be everyone&#039;s cup of tea but I can bet they&#039;re packed night after night.&nbsp; I&#039;m just glad to see some lively action in that space for a change.&nbsp; And I really do like what&#039;s going on in terms of food and nightlife on Ditmars as a whole.&nbsp; I&#039;m really looking forward to Uncle Jacks.

The tables by the window should only be for 2 or 4 people and should not be separated and placed 1 inch apart from one another.&nbsp; If you read the reviews on Yelp you will see that the negative reviews are in the majority.&nbsp; A lot of them said the food was overpriced and didn&#039;t taste good.&nbsp; And they also mentioned the loud noise and squeezing too many people in a tight space

				You must admit the great irony here.&nbsp; For years Okeanos was so empty you could have gone in and practice ballroom dancing.&nbsp; Now this place is busting at the seams.&nbsp; I can name plenty of places that are too loud, and packed so tightly that I will never return. This place may be that for you.&nbsp; For me, it&#039;s most places on the LES. What I do believe is that for everyone that doesn&#039;t find that this place suits them, there will be one or two that do.&nbsp; I believe they&#039;ll polish up the areas that they need to and that they&#039;ll have no trouble staying busy.&nbsp; Yelp is Yelp, and they&#039;ve been open for three days.&nbsp; Lets see what people are saying in April.&nbsp; That will mean a lot more.&nbsp; If they fail to keep their customers, then that will be the end of that.

I hate it when the goal is to pack as many in as possible, with about three inches between tables. And yes, plenty of that on the LES. But as you also said, there are other places to frequent. I just hope they won&#039;t get &quot;discovered&quot; and destroyed by the you-know-who....

				It&#039;s a rare thing that a restaurant has their act together in the opening days. So much so, that it&#039;s so impressive and noticeable when they do. I expect they are working out the kinks and are getting used to Astoria, which is not the kind of place where restaurants shove as many seats in a place as possible. It&#039;s fine braun to say she&#039;ll never recommend the place to anyone else, but that&#039;s short sighted and kind of vindictive. Give them a little time - I bet improvements will come soon enough.

				<br />I too was shocked at how packed this place was, and immediately after opening.<br /><br />I agree...we need to give them a chance.&nbsp; Sheesh.&nbsp; Opening up a new restaurant, where all the staff are obviously new to each other, they are still figuring out the layout of the place, the equipment, maybe some supplies didn&#039;t come in as expected, etc.&nbsp; ...and then on top of that, they likely didn&#039;t expect lines outside the door...well... let&#039;s be patient.<br /><br />That said though, a smart manager would have taken more charge and been more decisive and said for e.g., &#039;let&#039;s not pack &#039;em in....let&#039;s be frank with those waiting in line and tell them it&#039;s going to be a very long wait (so they might want to go somewhere else instead)...let&#039;s not try to turn over tables so quickly....etc&#039;&nbsp; ...unless of course that&#039;s what they PREFERRED this place to be all along... a chaotic packed-to-the-gills place that has the sense of being &#039;popular&#039; and is also loud, with quality of the experience taking a back seat to everything else.<br /><br />Also, lol to the person who mentioned the irony of Okeanos being empty and now this same space is packed.
