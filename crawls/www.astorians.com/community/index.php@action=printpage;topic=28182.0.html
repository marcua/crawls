				I have to point out, a few years ago, after a great number of accidents/other issues with truck drivers, a teacher from Ferrari said, in a hidden shadow interview, &quot;You see these truck drivers and wonder where they got their licences?&nbsp; That&#039;s Ferrari.&quot;.<br /><br /><br />I know that Ferrari is the school we most associate with this area, but I hope there will be more responses, because I need a recommendation also.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ll also point out, most driving schools teach you to <em>move the car around</em>; only experience, and hopefully a passenger with a lot more experience, can really teach you to <em>drive</em>.&nbsp; You don&#039;t actually have to take any lessons to get a license.

Not to pardon his behavior, but when you&#039;re driving in a village with tight often barely one lane roads or on the mountains with similar conditions, it is customary to beep your horn before going around the corner to warn oncoming traffic and vice versa. At night you flash your high beams. Not sure if you mentioned the location in your trip, or he just assumed you would be in a more rural setting, but this is a valid practice.

				A couple of years ago my husband took lessons from the place by the train at Ditmars and had a pleasant experience.&nbsp; They covered the GCP, LIE, driving in Manhattan, etc over the course of a few lessons and I remember the prices being reasonable.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Can&#039;t remember the name off the top of my head but it&#039;s on the same side as McDonald&#039;s going towards 23rd Avenue

				I&#039;m also looking for recommendations for a good driving school.<br />There&#039;s not too many responses here and the thread is old, so I was hoping to see if anyone has any more recommendations.<br /><br />Golden Star Driving School appears to have good reviews on Yelp, however most of the reviews are written by Yelpers who have only written 1-3 reviews, which is a little suspicious to me because that could indicate sock puppet accounts.
