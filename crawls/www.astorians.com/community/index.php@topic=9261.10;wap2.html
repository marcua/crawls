			http://printable-coupons.blogspot.com/<br /><br />The thread about rite aid made me remember I had been meaning to link you lot to this site. It&#039;s really great. Every time I go shopping, I check this site before I go. It&#039;s a big help. And I&#039;ll 3rd Fatwallet - but I mainly use it for free samples - you do get a lot of junk from fatwallet, though. I wound up with a (free) subscription to VIBE magazine (I&#039;m white. It was weird.)I got them to cancel it after 3 issues but - just a warning you will get spam as a result of free samples on fatwallet.

			Before I do any sort of online shopping, I check up on the site on http://www.retailmenot.com and 95% of the time they&#039;ll have some sort of percentage-off, or free shipping, or free stuff code... or all of the above!

			Just read an ad in USA Today for a free coupon for oscar meyer hot dogs. go to oscarmayer.com befor 11:59PM tonight. (sorry just read it now, know not much time) They ask for your email address and then your mailing address to mail the coupon in 4-6 weeks. Took me just a minute. Take Care.
