				Indeed, if you prefer not to get these simply go into your profile and turn that option off. In your case Jen, you had one thread you were still subscribed to.

				I think it is weird how people are now starting to receive them.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t actually received any recently.&nbsp; But when I first set up my profile on any board, I always look at the options they offer.&nbsp; I do remember turning that off in the beginning.<br /><br />Any clue as to why some people that may have never received them before and are now receiving them?

Now you can turn it on or off. If anyone doesn&#039;t like it please just go into your profile and disable it. Incidentally, there&#039;s a LOT of different options to customize the board under your profile settings - check it out!
