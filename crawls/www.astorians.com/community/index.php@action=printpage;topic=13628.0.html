				It going to be a lot of fun. It&#039;s a great happy hour deal yet they offer affordable drinks all night plus the space is really nice + friendly. Not to mention the fact that the music is really good and we&#039;re more than willing to work with our guests to make the night just right.<br /><br />If you&#039;re on facebook, please join the group to stay updated + provide feedback:<br />http://facebook.com/group.php?gid=114071830602<br /><br />Spread the word guys and gals, this Monday is kick off night and as always, the more the merrier...<br />

				No... But there is gay-friendly-straight Randolph (me) who triples as the DJ + Manager + Event/Marketing Director. Then there is also gay-friendly-straight Lily behind the bar shaking up the drinks and serving smiles. Lily and I have a bunch of LGBT friends who&#039;ve been looking for a place in Astoria to hang out + party so we cooked up &quot;Come as you are Mondays&quot; especially since those who&#039;ve come visit us at Bungalo have fallen in love with the place.<br /><br />As the night grows we&#039;ll probably get a colorful Waiter/ress to provide table service and maybe add a few DJs to the roster to keep things fresh. We figured we start it off with just us 2 for now and scale as the demand grows (it was the only way to get the owner to agree since times are tough).<br /><br />We are really interested in making the night work and would love any feedback / suggestions.<br />Please stop by, have a drink and let us know how we can &quot;Come as you are Mondays&quot; a success for everyone!<br /><br />thanks and hope to see you @ Bungalo on Monday nights... :-)<br />Randolph + Lily

				sounds great - I bet you&#039;ll get a good crowd.&nbsp; Lots of LGBT folks living along Broadway.&nbsp; You should get listed in HX and Next as well.
