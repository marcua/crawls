				rrrrright.....<br /><br />let's see... words cannot express my feelings about what just happened tonite. my landlords probably think someone is killing me b/c i just been screaming and snarling at the tv...<br /><br />ever heard of that primal scream therapy? it's done either in groups or individually with a therapist. you basically scream from the bottom of your heart just like you did while you were a baby when you wanted your needs to be met. it's supposed to be cathartic... <br /><br />so, to everyone who cannot express themselves with words, let's let out a nice collective primal scream....<br /><br /><br />AAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUUUGGGGGHHH!!!!!<br /><br />&gt;grumble&lt;<br />Rosemary

				hello all...<br /><br />i was listening to NPR yesterday, and heard this great article about how Britain has a retirement plan like the one that Bush is proposing, and it discussed how effective, and how the citizens feel about it.<br /><br />http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4502635<br /><br />it's on audio, there is no transcript for this yet.<br /><br />this is a pretty good article that deserves a lot of thought....<br /><br />ok, back to screaming...

				well, this story doesnt have much to do with the president himself, but he is going to be responsible for appointing new judges (i'm sorry to say it, but it seems as though justice Rehnquist is gonna go pretty soon...) and this would just be terrible.<br /><br />so, the ten commandments debate...<br /><br />http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;e=1&amp;u=/ap/20050302/ap_on_go_su_co/scotus_ten_commandments<br /><br />avert your eyes?!?!!? that's not the point here. i've said it once, i'll say it again! I LOVE THIS COUNTRY! amongst other reasons, i really love the rights that are entitled to us: freedom of speech and freedom to practice religion. but, at the same time i feel that religion should be separated from government.<br /><br />which is why the ten commandments do not belong on a monument in front of a Texas court house. the article says that there is a depiction of moses in the supreme court house-- BUT it also includes that of other religions/creeds, etc.... kind of inclusive. <br /><br />prayer is cool if it's done in an inclusive way and not really using prayer from a specific religion. <br /><br />this ten commandments thing is totally imposing someone's Christian values onto others-- not cool.<br /><br />gonna go scream and throw more stuff at the tv now...

				To me, the issue of displays and monuments are mere window dressing issues on the state level. What I feel should really be the issue are laws that encroach upon freedom of conscience. This guideline, I feel, is the heart of the anti-establishment claus. &nbsp;Now that it is at the US Supreme Court level, however, I expect that the majority opinion handed down will give some guidelines, but be sufficiently muddled as to defy reasoning and clarity. <br /><br />As an aside, I find that the only real knowledgeable commentators on the US Supreme Court justices are former clerks who worked for them. If a former clerk of a justice gets on the news shows…that’s the person who knows what they are talking about.

				Current Supreme Court clerks tend not to be commentators on the Justices they currently serve under...There tends to be a secretive &quot;code&quot; that you don't violate...this also applies, (per my understanding) between chambers of the nine Justices themselves. But the reason former Supreme Court clerks, when they become commentator, are so skilled at understanding the thinking of the Justices is because they most likely wrote the opinions of the Justice they served under...(little known fact).

				this is an email forwarded to me by one of my friends who is Native American and working on Capitol Hill right now. &nbsp;It is an article from the Washington Post from today, March 25, 2005.<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />This is confirmation that compassion and values seem to only be valid for certain sections of the population. &nbsp;To think that I had actually given the WH the benefit of the doubt and thought that they had released a statement on this and I somehow missed it, but I was right…<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Native Americans Criticize Bush's Silence <br />Response to School Shooting Is Contrasted With President's Intervention in Schiavo Case <br /><br />By Ceci Connolly<br />Washington Post Staff Writer<br />Friday, March 25, 2005; Page A06 <br /><br />MINNEAPOLIS, March 24 -- Native Americans across the country -- including tribal leaders, academics and rank-and-file tribe members -- voiced anger and frustration Thursday that President Bush has responded to the second-deadliest school shooting in U.S. history with silence.<br /><br />Three days after 16-year-old Jeff Weise killed nine members of his Red Lake tribe before taking his own life, grief-stricken American Indians complained that the White House has offered little in the way of sympathy for the tribe situated in the uppermost region of Minnesota.<br /><br />&quot;From all over the world we are getting letters of condolence, the Red Cross has come, but the so-called Great White Father in Washington hasn't said or done a thing,&quot; said Clyde Bellecourt, a Chippewa Indian who is the founder and national director of the American Indian Movement here. &quot;When people's children are murdered and others are in the hospital hanging on to life, he should be the first one to offer his condolences. . . . If this was a white community, I don't think he'd have any problem doing that.&quot;<br /><br />Weise's victims included his grandfather and five teenagers; seven other students were wounded, and two of them remain in serious condition in a hospital in Fargo, N.D.<br /><br />White House spokesman Scott McClellan, in an informal discussion with reporters Tuesday, said: &quot;Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of those who were killed.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I hope that he would say something,&quot; said Victoria Graves, a cultural educator at Red Lake Elementary School on the reservation. &quot;It's important that there's acknowledgment of the tragedy. It's important he sees the tribes are out here. We need help.&quot;<br /><br />The reaction to Bush's silence was particularly bitter given his high-profile, late-night intervention on behalf of Terri Schiavo, the brain-damaged Florida woman caught in a legal battle over whether her feeding tube should be reinserted. <br /><br />&quot;The fact that Bush preempted his vacation to say something about Ms. Schiavo and here you have 10 native people gunned down and he can't take time to speak is very telling,&quot; said David Wilkins, interim chairman of the Department of American Indian Studies at the University of Minnesota and a member of the North Carolina-based Lumbee tribe.<br /><br />&quot;He has not been real visible in Indian country,&quot; said former senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell (R-Colo.). &quot;He's got a lot of irons in the fire, but this is important.&quot; <br /><br />Even more alarming than Bush's silence, he said, is the president's proposal to cut $100 million from several Indian programs next year.<br /><br />After hearing grumbling from tribal leaders, Jacqueline Johnson, executive director of the National Congress of American Indians, called the White House on Thursday to inquire about Bush's silence. &quot;I wanted to make sure the White House is paying attention to this issue,&quot; she said. &quot;I wasn't sure.&quot;<br /><br />Asked Thursday about Bush's silence, spokeswoman Dana Perino said that he plans to dedicate part of his Saturday radio address to the Red Lake tragedy and that he is following the case closely through the FBI and the Justice Department.<br /><br />In the hours after the massacre at Columbine High School in Colorado in 1999, President Bill Clinton publicly expressed his condolences and followed up a few days later with a radio address in which he proposed new gun control measures and school safety projects.<br /><br />At the Red Lake Urban Indian Office here, volunteer Marilyn Westbrook said she was disappointed but not surprised.<br /><br />&quot;I don't feel he cares about the American Indian people,&quot; said Westbrook, as she collected donations of gas cards and money to enable fellow Red Lake members to make the 260-mile journey to the reservation. &quot;Why hasn't he made any statements about what happened with this shooting?&quot;<br /><br />Staff writers Dana Hedgpeth in Red Lake and Peter Baker in Waco, Tex., and research editor Lucy Shackelford in Washington contributed to this report. <br /><br />© 2005 The Washington Post Company <br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />AAAAAAAACK!

				The only reason that Bush got involved in the case of Ms. Schiavo is because his brother made sure he would win Florida when he was runing against Gore. He owed his brother one. The government is constatnly sticking it's nose in places it doesnt belong.
