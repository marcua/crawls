			I don&#039;t think building casinos is a jobs program.&nbsp; Nor is it a good way to fund schools.&nbsp; <br />I think it&#039;s embarrassing that this proposal has been put forth and that the UFT is in support.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />This is just my gut feeling.&nbsp; Not researched.&nbsp; <br />I&#039;d appreciate knowing why I should support this.

			If memory serves, the lottery is touted as being for eduction but revenue goes into the general revenue pot and is not earmarked for educational purposes.&nbsp; I wonder if this is the same racket.<br /><br />Now if they earmarked the Casino money for gambling addiction programs I would vote for it just for the surreal aspect of it.<br />

But, it seems that constitutional amendments have taken that power from them.&nbsp; Which is silly. I can&#039;t imagine for the life of me why I need to approve a land-swap. WTF. Maybe it is time to rewrite......nevermind, Wall Street and the Energy companies will just screw the states. <br /><br /><br />Prop 1. I get the initial thrust of why I should vote for this. Just down the street from me on 30th Ave is a bodega advertising daily trips to Atlantic City. Wouldn&#039;t it be better if they went to the Catskills? However, I am hard pressed to believe that all the sunshine they are blowing up my ass will actually happen. I&#039;m inclined...but not buying the ads. <br /><br /><br />As far as Prop 6 goes, This seems like a pure power grab to get a few more years of power. I don&#039;t buy it. I would support a term of office, say 20 years and then retire, so your age isn&#039;t a part of a factor in an appointment. As written, Prop 6 is a no......but I&#039;m willing to support another approach. <br /><br /><br /><br />
