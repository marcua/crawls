				hi tiffany<br /><br /><br /><br />here's my short list (because the list is still VERY short - ie there aren't that many)<br /><br /><br /><br />Volo cafe/bistro - &nbsp;on Ditmars just past 29th st. (Open until pretty late. panini sandwiches, pasta dishes, (excellent couscous)nice pastries, cookies, good espresso, take-out quick italian dinner on the way home from work when im too lazy to cook<br /><br /><br /><br />Fatty's Cafe/ Bar/ Bistro - &nbsp;also on Ditmars. Cool bar, beergarden in back, serves brunch on the weekend, haven't tried food there, hear its good/ oh yeah, the bartender (Dino) is developing quite a reputation for his 'mojito'...<br /><br /><br /><br />McCanns - huge wood sign, Ditmars (on the less cool side of 31st. St.) near Thirty One the new French restaurant I haven't tried yet/ Irish pub-ish place, tvs running with sports on if you like that kind of thing...<br /><br /><br /><br />i guess that's about it - near Ditmars, at least, that i know of - but that isnt saying much<br /><br /><br /><br />good luck with the hunt<br /><br /><br /><br />ff

				I second all of the above, adding that weekend brunch at Fatty's is a great atmosphere. &nbsp;The owners are extremely friendly and seem to know everyone who walks through the door. &nbsp;Same with Volo, which organizes gatherings for various interests as well. &nbsp;Both are on Ditmars. &nbsp;Doesn't hurt that the food at both is extremely good. &nbsp;Peach Freeze is another up-and-comer.

				Title: <strong>Other than Chaos on Tuesdays, Albatros, or crescent lounge</strong><br />

			<dd class="postbody">
				Does anyone know of any gay hangouts? &nbsp;Chaos can be pretty tired and its during the week and doesn't represent the diversity that is Astoria. &nbsp;Albatros has potential as a hole in the wall, but has too much of a midwestern feel and kind of dumpy. &nbsp;Crescent lounge is nice, but has a weird vibe and the music is totally inappropriate (in my opinion).<br /><br />I know I'm being picky. &nbsp;But any news on new places? etc.<br /><br />&nbsp;:shock: &nbsp;:shock:
