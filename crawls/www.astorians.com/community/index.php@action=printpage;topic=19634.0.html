				We were involved in a car accident on Friday morning on Steinway Street and 20th Rd. It was right in front of the bus stop. If anyone was standing there and witnessed the accident please contact me if you wouldn&#039;t mind. Just trying to get all my ducks in a row. Thank you.

				You okay?&nbsp; Other people involved okay?<br /><br />I&#039;ve driven up and down Steinway Street past 20th Road so many times and I always slow down at that intersection because it&#039;s so hard to see and be seen at that intersection.&nbsp; Countless times I&#039;ve seen near misses there.

				I didn&#039;t see anything, but I&#039;m so sorry that happened to you! I used to park on 20th Rd all the time (I got rid of my car since), and that&#039;s a really tough intersection to see anything, especially with the way people fly on Steinway up here. It&#039;s one of those intersections where (unless you have an SUV and can see over all the parked cars) you just have to hold your breath and hope for the best because you&#039;re pretty much driving blind.

He hit the back door on my daughter&#039;s side. Thank God she is ok but since the van had this Mad Max setup on the front with iron bars it pretty much destroyed the door. <br /><br />I have driven on 20th rd all my life, if you catiously inch out you have no issues crossing over Steinway. The thing I don&#039;t get is how they can make that a 2 way road.
