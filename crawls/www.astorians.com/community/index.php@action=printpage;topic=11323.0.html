				Everyone who reads my posts would already know this, but yes I agree. matty3bucks, in case you&#039;ve missed it, there&#039;s a long thread about this in the Board Announcements section. The issue seems to have been dropped since the new moderators came in, although just about every debate thread ends up with someone commenting on the kind of nods they&#039;re getting.<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry but regarding ignoring the nods - no, I don&#039;t want to do that. If merm doesn&#039;t want to do away with the nods completely, then I would appreciate the option of people here being able to turn nods on or off. What I don&#039;t like is having to have the nods there. If someone disagrees with me, I want to know why and discuss it with them, not have these mysterious nods appear over everything I type.

				The nods do nothing to enhance the dialogue. They prevent people from expressing their views. They intimidate newer posters. They serve no real purpose. So, ask yourself, why are they still here? I am generally a black and white kinda person. I either love something passionately or I just don&#039;t give a crap. But, I must admit that I really do hate three things: roaches, mice and nods!

				I see the negatives of the nods, but I kind of like them. Sometimes I totally agree and a thread can get really crowded with things like &quot;I agree&quot;....&quot;yup&quot;...&quot;I feel the same&quot;...and then the thread gets watered down and boring.<br /><br />Maybe it would be cool if when you neg nod someone, a window pops up and you have to post to support your neg nod? Or maybe (just thinking out loud here) the name of the nodder pops up next to the &#039;thumbs&quot; section so you can see who negs and who pos&#039;s? Accountability might encourage that person to either take the nod a littl emore seriously or back it up with discussion...but I have NO idea how to actualoy make that happen. (I would have more success if I tried to explain how a cell phone works).

				This is bullshit! <br /><br /><strong>What if instead of a thumbs-down it was a middle finger up?</strong> Would that be better for the little cowards who are so insecure in their resolve about this contentious matter that they feel so much more comfortable just running around the forum neg nodding people they don&#039;t like or don&#039;t agree with without ever having to voice a logical opinion? <br /><br />It is disruptive . . . <br />It is rude . . .&nbsp; <br />It is insulting . . .&nbsp; <br />It is disrespectful . . .&nbsp; <br />It is annoying. . . . <br />It is demeaning. . . . <br />It is abusive. . . . <br />It is degrading. . . .

				It&#039;s effing amazing actually. Para hit the nail on the head when she said that every post here that is against the nods or doesn&#039;t agree with their being on the board, got neg nodded. And not just one or two, several. Even my comment, which was meant in pure jest, to jennifer that she buy a punching bag, got a neg nod! I mean if you have the wherewithall to come here to look at a post, why not just hit &quot;reply&quot; and do just that, reply, instead of thinking &quot; oh, I&#039;m just going to nod because I don&#039;t have the patience to actually compose a whole sentence or paragraph&quot;

				Odenhal, that&#039;s not the point, and obviously you just don&#039;t get it. Yes I know they&#039;re only nods, but why can&#039;t someone post if they disagree or agree with something instead of pressing a effing button? Like you just said you did. Lazy much? There are plenty of instances where I agree with something, but instead of nodding like I used to like doing, I either post a response or nod my head in agreement. I know it sounds weird, but I&#039;m sure you even do it when you&#039;re at the movies or watching the television, so why not when you&#039;re surfing the net?

On this forum it was never a problem. Look at posts from a couple years back if you don&#039;t believe me. Yeah, we had some posts like that, but we still have them now even with the nods. Not to mention that the negative nods are more often used as anonymous attacks on people as opposed to just meaning people agree or disagree. Take what jennifer said - she admitted that it feels really good to negative nod people who annoy her. You can bet other people use the nods the same say. So it&#039;s not okay to straight out call someone an asshole, but it&#039;s okay to call them that via negative nod.<br /><br />ferna, thanks for the illustration.

				I am still on record with being fine with the nods. Yes, I use them because sometimes I&#039;m simply lazy and don&#039;t want to just post &quot;I agree&quot;.&nbsp; Often I contribute to threads if I have something thoughtful and well-thought out.&nbsp; I stay away from the more controversial threads (read: politics) because it&#039;s not my bag (and I&#039;m not a great debater), so I don&#039;t really know what goes on in there with regard to nods.<br /><br />I can&#039;t agree with NYCMacUser in her colorful expression of her distaste for the nods.&nbsp; I disagree with the assertion that this place is devoid of fun and that it&#039;s not informative.&nbsp; I find a lot of helpful and informative things here, and I think there are a lot of good natured, fun people here!&nbsp; To paint this place with such a broad stroke of negativity does an injustice to those that do spend time here contributing to the community, and enjoying each other.&nbsp; <br /><br />I also can&#039;t relate to the idea that nods might rigidly control what one says or does.&nbsp; I&#039;ve said this before - why give them so much power?&nbsp; I know others disagree (by writing it out or by nodding), and that&#039;s ok.&nbsp; <br /><br />And meeting at a cafe or restaurant to discuss serious issues.&nbsp; Why not??&nbsp; It&#039;s fun and speaking for myself, I much prefer to discuss serious issues face to face than on a messageboard.&nbsp; Plus there&#039;s food and drink involved... mmm....

And like Redsoxfan said, I know I get neg nodded a lot not because people disagree with me, but because they just don&#039;t like me or my views and the fact that I&#039;m VERY outspoken, but that&#039;s ok, but disagree with me by telling me so, not by nodding. It&#039;s so boring and childish.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I think I like an idea of ridding the &quot;negative nod&quot; and keeping a &quot;positive nod&quot;.&nbsp; It&#039;ll be nice if people can agree without having to add a post stating a simple agreement.&nbsp; However, if people tend to disagree, there are usually reasons they disagree.&nbsp; This would give them the opportunity to state why the disagree.<br /><br />Instead of discussing pros and cons of the nods, maybe people could suggest ideas that are burning in their heads.&nbsp; This would help people come to terms of a compromise and possibly give administration something to work with.

				I have a few simple questions to you, merm. &nbsp;What was the thought process behind the nods? &nbsp;Did you think it would add to the conversation? &nbsp;Did you think people who were too timid to type out their thoughts would have a way to add to the discussion? &nbsp;<br /><br />Did you not, or do you not, see that for many posters the nods are a way to personally attack people whose posts they don&#039;t like? &nbsp;Or worse, a way to attack the people no matter what they post! &nbsp;If you&#039;re not allowed to &quot;attack&quot; other posters, how do you allow the negative nods? &nbsp;<br /><br />They&#039;re very passive aggressive. &nbsp;I have so little respect for passive aggressive behavior. &nbsp;merm, are you passive aggressive?<br />

				The reasons for the nods being put in place were thoroughly discussed when they were implemented - and the idea really hasn&#039;t changed. (threads have already been referenced)<br /><br />Speaking personally I think nods are helpful because they are a way for people to see how readers are responding to each point that is being made in the thread all the way down. If each person that was participating in a thread were to quote and respond to every person that they &quot;agree&quot; with and every person they &quot;disagree&quot; with the thread would be insanely long.<br /><br />For the most part the nods are working in that they demonstrate the tone of the conversation and how it&#039;s being received by readers. Like it or not, this site has many more readers than posters - and the nods give them a voice as well - as is demonstrated in many polls where there are far fewer posts than votes. I also find the nods I think are also positive in that they help shape and provide feedback about the conversation (take this one for example). <br /><br />I&#039;m not saying there isn&#039;t a down side to them - there is, and I recognize that.&#160; But most of the time, the negative nods are given for a reason (immaturity, personal attacks, grand standing, poor taste, bad argument), some times they are given for no reason at all or out of immaturity (someone doesn&#039;t &quot;like&quot; another person etc). However, I&#039;m still of the opinion that their utility outweighs the negatives.<br /><br />For whatever reason when I get neg-nodded I don&#039;t take it too personally.

				If negative nods were money I would have gotten rich last week.&nbsp; They don&#039;t bother me though.&nbsp; &nbsp;If some people are really bothered I can understand that, why not leave option to people posting?&nbsp; &nbsp; Let them turn off an &#039;Allow nods&quot; and &quot;don&#039;t allow&quot; nods to post function.&nbsp; Unless it would be too much trouble to program into this system.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Only problem then is people would say something negative since they can&#039;t do the nod thing, and that would be worse.

				merm, thanks for your response.&nbsp; <br /><br />I do take them personal.&nbsp; I think NOT taking them personally is part of the problem with them.&nbsp; They are a form of rude communicating.&nbsp; And I think that&#039;s a big problem online.&nbsp; With anonymity, or the perception of being unknown, comes outrageous or rude or thoughtless dialogue.&nbsp; People become numb to it.<br /><br />It&#039;s not that I&#039;m losing sleep over them.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m already an insomniac.

				I started answering this thread earlier - forgot why I X&#039;ed it without posting my reply.<br /><br />I like the nods for the fact that while 60 some odd people can neg nod Rendo for misleading thread titles, the thread itself isn&#039;t 60 some odd posts wrong with people calling him an asshole. Mind you the &#039;Strand in Astoria&#039; thread is just an example, and I don&#039;t mean any attack by it. <br />ref: http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=10690.0 (http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=10690.0)<br />I <em>dis</em>like the nods because they really don&#039;t contribute. And as far as not taking them seriously, that&#039;s all great on paper, but when you post something that you believe and don&#039;t think is controversial, just your opinion which you are voicing because, well, that&#039;s just kinda what we do, and then you come back a while later and see you&#039;ve gotten 5 nods (pos or neg) and no actual replies to your post! You&#039;re stuck there like WTF! In a recent thread, Billz even posted a reply essentially to the nods, because his previous post had gotten x amount of neg nods so he felt the need to clarify himself. <br />ref: http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=11335.msg140311#msg140311 (http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=11335.msg140311#msg140311)<br /><br />I have seen on a similar forum a nod feature in which the &#039;nodders&#039; were identified. It was tiny like our current nod feature is, except it was collapsible, to reveal two columns, one listing who pos nodded, one listing who neg nodded. Personally, I think this is definitely what we need. I don&#039;t think there is an issue with the nodding feature itself, just the anonymity of it.

				You know what, it&#039;s easy to not care much about the nods when everything you post gets positive nods, or when you don&#039;t take part in potentially controversial discussions. For those of us with often times less popular opinions, it&#039;s not so nice.<br /><br />merm, if you&#039;re not going to get rid of the nods, can they at least be made optional like some other features are? Either of these ways would be good: 1) disable nods on one&#039;s own posts so nobody can nod them either way, or 2) make it so the user merely cannot see the nod feature. I promise I won&#039;t start going around posting &quot;I agree!!!!!!!!!!!!!!111111 +1&quot; if I turn off my nodding option.<br /><br />EDIT: On second thought, I think the second option would be the best one.

				I don&#039;t mind the nods - I tend to only positive nod, negative nodding seems a bit mean, but I do think that when folks receive a lot of negative nods, they might get a sense that either their approach to the topic or discussion might be not being well received or perhaps they&#039;re not being constructive.&nbsp; I think the nods, in some ways, are akin to the personal cues folks give off in social situations, so I think they serve a purpose.&nbsp; I think allowing folks to turn them off could be an interesting experiment.&nbsp; How would that work though?&nbsp; Would that person just not be able to see if their posts or any posts got nodded or would they just not be able to nod?

				In general, I&#039;m not bothered by the nod feature. &nbsp;I absolutely do not find it to be a rude form of communication unless someone posted something completely neutral and unoffensive like &quot;Today I am happy&quot; and someone gave them a neg nod. &nbsp;That would be clearly stupid and should be taken for what it&#039;s worth (especially if the post was in a &quot;Are you happy?&quot; thread).<br /><br />I personally don&#039;t want to go through post after post of &quot;I agree&quot;, or &quot;what she said&quot;, or &quot;I disagree&quot;. &nbsp;I think that some people that are advocating for the nods to be done away with are trying to encourage a more lively debate or discussion but the reality of the situation is that maybe a poster summed it up so well that you don&#039;t have anything to add because you are in complete agreement. &nbsp;So if you don&#039;t want the pos/neg nod feature then you also would not want the &quot;I agree&quot;, &quot;I disagree&quot;, &quot;what he said&quot; &nbsp;posts. &nbsp;So why then limit the thread to a discussion of a handful of people without inviting the masses to &quot;vote&quot;, so to speak, on what position they are liking the best? &nbsp;On the floor of some governmental bodies you take votes...members clap/don&#039;t clap, say &quot;aye&quot; or &quot;nay&quot;, raise/or don&#039;t raise their hands, or otherwise vocalize/express a short form of agreement/disagreement. &nbsp;What&#039;s the difference here if you agree or disagree with a particular post and really have nothing else to add? &nbsp;After all, are you not, in essence, vocalizing your opinion to an audience? &nbsp;People don&#039;t like tomatoes being thrown at them but they can&#039;t hold back a smile when the crowd roars....i get it.<br /><br />As one of the moderators of this board, the other reality for me is that some members just don&#039;t know how to communicate without being rude and offensive. &nbsp;If the goal is to promote intelligent dialogue then let&#039;s do it intelligently without all the attacking and name calling that sometimes goes down. &nbsp;For me, the nod feature is also a way to express agreement/disagreement to an overly aggressive or inappropriate post without getting sucked into the nonsense of it all. &nbsp;The group addresses the problem collectively without allowing the loose cannon to engage the majority of members in a senseless dispute. &nbsp;<br /><br />I&#039;m also not sure what we gain in removing the anonymity of the feature. &nbsp;Does it really make a difference? &nbsp;So you know who agreed or disagreed with you...what&#039;s the importance? &nbsp;<br /><br />Notwithstanding any of the above, I&#039;m totally open to changing my opinion on the nod feature.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

				Sorry AJ, when I read you, I thought you were saying something like &quot;if&quot; that happened it would be rude and I was saying &quot;yes it is happening.&quot; &nbsp;I misunderstood. &nbsp;(part of online communicating.)<br /><br />I haven&#039;t read every thread but I can&#039;t help but notice how often someone expresses something and it&#039;s completely reasonable and not unkind and is germane to the conversation (whether I agree with the post or not) and they get negative nods. &nbsp;To me that&#039;s people using the nods to be catty. &nbsp;And I&#039;m not talking about posters who are confrontational a lot or argumentative. &nbsp;And besides, even those posters aren&#039;t always acting up - there are many occasions when their input is interesting and moves the dialogue forward. &nbsp;So even in those cases, the nodding is just spiteful.<br /><br />What do I think about posters adding to a dialogue with &quot;I agree&quot; or &quot;not&quot; posts, AJ? &nbsp;At least they&#039;re adding to the dialogue and they&#039;re taking responsibility for their comments. &nbsp;<br /><br />There&#039;s something empowering about ownership. &nbsp;There&#039;s something cowardly about hiding behind a nod. &nbsp;&quot;I can neg nod you because I don&#039;t like you or I don&#039;t like what you said, but I don&#039;t have to expose myself when I do it.&quot; &nbsp;baloney. &nbsp;<br /><br />We can have this discussion until hell freezes over and I will probably still feel that they aren&#039;t in the best interests of the site. &nbsp;And there&#039;s one more thing, I disagree with: &nbsp;I don&#039;t agree that it&#039;s the &quot;silent readers&quot; doing most of the nodding. &nbsp; On the contrary, I think it&#039;s a combinations of that and the active posters trying to piss each other off. &nbsp;As was pointed out already, a way to say F U. &nbsp;Seriously, is that what the site is trying to achieve? &nbsp;Like I said before, I feel they&#039;re very passive aggressive. &nbsp;And childish. &nbsp;And no, dear nodders, my feelings don&#039;t get hurt when you neg nod. &nbsp;You could never have that much power. &nbsp;merm, I just don&#039;t understand why you would put something on your site that lowers the maturity bar instead of raises it up.<br /><br />

				I think the nod feature is annoying. &nbsp;As I posted in an earlier thread about the nods, the thing that gets me is that the nods are used in a inconsistant way. &nbsp;Many times someone will post about, for example, a bad experience in a restaurant and get negative nods. &nbsp;In that case, it seems people are neg nodding the bad restuarant, not the OP&#039;s post. &nbsp;But who&#039;s to know? &nbsp;I sometimes nod people, usually to echo an ongoing discussion: pos nod &quot;right on&quot;; neg nod &quot;no way&quot;. &nbsp;Cause really who wants to read posts over and over that say &quot;right on,&quot; etc. &nbsp;<br /><br />As for comments about popularity contests and cliques, really, who the f___ cares. &nbsp;This isn&#039;t junior high. &nbsp;Its an online message board. &nbsp;I&#039;ve got enough opportunities in life to have my feeling hurt/ego stroked that I don&#039;t take what goes on here all that seriously. &nbsp;As for popularity, unless you make an ass of yourself enough times (or if I know you in real life), I can&#039;t remember Astori Luv&#039;s comments from Buddy&#039;s from Casicua&#039;s for example (totally random choice of screen-names). &nbsp;Sorry folks, I just don&#039;t pay that much attention. &nbsp;Then again, I can barely remember my own comments.

				I don&#039;t really care either, I&#039;ve probably been neg-nodded more than pos-nodded. I don&#039;t want to complicate things, so I just figure the negs mean &quot;no, I disagree&quot; and pos nods &quot;yes, I agree&quot;. If they are meant to be personal I don&#039;t pay it any mind.

				I would actually say the quality of dialog overall has improved since the nods were added. And, I also don&#039;t assume that just because someone gets negative nodded that it&#039;s the same as saying &quot;F U&quot;. For me it&#039;s a bit of a stretch to assume it means that because it can be just as easily argued that a neg nod simply expresses general disagreement in a respectful way. I have no reason to suspect that people&#039;s use of the nods is hostile.<br /><br />The argument that nodding is &quot;hiding behind anonymity&quot; and &quot;cowardly&quot; doesn&#039;t fit for me because this entire forum is anonymous. I would argue that many of the posts that get negative nodded in the first place are ones that the poster would never express in a public setting because of the fact that they are posting on an anonymous site and &quot;hiding behind the internet&quot; (to borrow the concept). Even if we forced people to display their &quot;names&quot; when they nodded they&#039;d still be anonymous.<br /><br />The nods I think can help expose well thought out and respectful dialog vs trollish and immature conduct, and keep the conversation moving without people just posting &quot;I agree&quot;, or &quot;I disagree&quot;.

All nods can possibly do - and that is in a perfect world where everybody uses nods equally in all cases, which doesn&#039;t happen on this board - is reflect the majority and minority opinions here. What many people are noticing is that those who tend to be in the minority feel like they&#039;re being voted off the island, as it were, as if our opinions are unwelcome. Hell, maybe they are. But unless that&#039;s the sort of thing you&#039;re going for, I don&#039;t get why you&#039;d continue to support this feature instead of just requesting that people who feel like posting &quot;I agree&quot; or &quot;I disagree&quot; hold off on posting until they have something more to add. <br /><br />You&#039;ve mentioned eGullet a few times as being a big influence on your designing of the rules here. Can you imagine what that board would be like with nods on all the posts? I imagine quite a few of those people would get openly pissed off and many would probably stop posting. I&#039;ve never even seen another message board that had nods on it.

				I agree with Alexa (I did positively nod you for that statement).&nbsp; Positive nods are easy to give because you like what someone said.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think people go around positive nodding people because they like them, then there would be no 0 Nods on any posts.&nbsp; Everyone would have either a net + or a net -.&nbsp; The negative nods seem to be really what people are having issues with.&nbsp; This is where the consistency gets messy, people disagreeing with or not liking the person.<br /><br />I think I remember merm saying that he was just trying it out and seeing what comes of it.&nbsp; Well, I do tend to agree that nods lead me one way or another when reading a thread (prejudging).&nbsp; I hate it.&nbsp; I want to come up with an opinion on my own.&nbsp; I also like my aforementioned idea of simply ridding the negative nod, or adding a requirement for the reason why you disagree (as Alexa suggested).<br /><br />Enigmacat also hit it right on the nose with the idea of the anonymity of handles.&nbsp; Many of us that have been around for a while have met other people in person and the username is not so anonymous anymore.&nbsp; Some of us can at least put faces to user names.<br /><br />Basically, I think that there is an overwhelming amount of <strong>community members</strong> that do not agree with the nodding system as it currently stands.&nbsp; Whether they stay or go, something does need to be done to address the situation instead of keeping it the way it is.

				Jennifer, I don&#039;t agree with your interpretation of Daisy&#039;s post, especially after reading her entire post.&nbsp; There are obviously different degrees to how affected people are by something, even if it is something they don&#039;t like.&nbsp; The bottomline is she has participated in this discussion, more than most, and has provided her insight and opinion on the issue.&nbsp; So I don&#039;t think it is fair to say she is bashing then jumping off the bandwagon.<br /><br />I don&#039;t want this to be interpretted as a pro this one con that one thing.&nbsp; My ultimate point is that many people have offered a number of suggestions on alternatives to the nod feature and I would rather have a discussion on that than the degree of passion someone should have over this issue.

				I&#039;m still wondering if there&#039;s anyone who is opposed to the idea of keeping the nods and making them not anonymous. Maybe not automatically displayed, but if you clicked on it, you could see it. Or allowing users to turn the feature off for their posts.<br /><br />Are there any other compromises that might be feasible?<br /><br />I don&#039;t know much about message board programing, so I&#039;m not sure if these ideas are possible.

There have been several discussions that I&#039;ve participated in, and inevitably someone comes in and tells people it&#039;s not a big deal and they need to get a life. That IS condescending and insulting, as it also is when people come in just to say they personally are not interested in arguing about whatever it is being discussed.<br /><br />Unlike having nods on all your posts, as a member of this board you do not need to read or post in threads you aren&#039;t interested in. If you do see a topic that people seem to be getting unreasonably heated about, consider that these people are probably not fuming at their computers and pounding on the keys, and that they do things with their lives aside from talk about things on astorians. Just because a topic interests them that does not interest you does not mean they have no life or any other interests or hobbies.<br /><br />Back to the topic at hand, paratactical, I too would like someone with a say on this to address the idea of the nods being an optional feature. That would solve a lot of the problems people are having. The people who like them could still use them, and the people who don&#039;t like them wouldn&#039;t have to see them. merm, I think I speak for a lot of people when I say a compromise would really be appreciated on this.
