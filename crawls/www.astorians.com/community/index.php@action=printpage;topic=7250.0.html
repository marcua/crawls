				I bought a new laptop 2 months ago online from Dell. Iv&#039;e gotten stuff from them before, no prob. While I&#039;m checking out, I get hit with this &quot;No Interest for 3 Month&quot; promo if I get a Dell Preferred Whatever account. I was planning on paying for the computer in full, but thought, hey I can budget it out over three months and not have to pay interest. What&#039;s not to like, right?<br /><br />I make my purchase, get &#039;instant approval&#039; and all that. Then my DFS card shows up in the mail with all the Terms of Agreement and stuff. First statement arrives some time later and I pay a hefty chunk.<br /><br />2nd statement arrives -- and they&#039;re charging me intererst!!!!! And at 19.24%!!!!! :ticked: There was no explicit indication that they would do that. What kills me is that I feel tricked into getting a damn card and having to pay super-high interest, that I never would have otherwise. Had I known that I would certainly have never accepted the card! But I didn&#039;t find this out for two months. There was no letter saying &quot;you got the card, but not the promo.&quot;<br /><br />I call DFS and get basically nowhere, except they do credit me <em>part</em> of the interest charge. There&#039;s still this very slimy one-time &quot;billing finance charge&quot; I have to pay -- what the hell is that?<br /><br />So I dash of a tersely-worded complaint and get a boilerplate response about how they calculate who is eligible for the promo and all that bullshit. I say bullshit because my credit rating is <strong>stellar</strong>.<br /><br />I&#039;m one of those freaky Americans who has (thank God) no credit card debt. I used to, but I started a very disciplined plan 4 years ago and I&#039;m very happy to say that I have no debt. Not only that, when I had debt I paid on-time and well above the minimum. Sometimes multiple payments in one month! I also paid off a car loan in full a good 1.5 years before term.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure they never had any intention of honoring the promo, no matter how good one&#039;s credit rating is. In my opinion Dell Financial is a slimy organization that tries to bilk people out of more money. What a bunch of scumbags!<br /><br />That&#039;s what you get for trying to be financially responsible. Effiing BASTARDS!!!! :ticked::ticked::ticked::ticked::ticked:<br /><br />

				I&#039;m so sorry to hear about this, what f-in bs!!&nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks for posting this though, makes it a lesson for all of us.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen ads for cards like that before when making hefty purchases, I betcha the majority of the companies never give you the no interest promo.&nbsp; I hope you can pay off the rest asap and close the account with them asap.&nbsp; And then tell them where to go and swear you&#039;ll never do business with them again.&nbsp; Jerks.

				Do a little research on the Dell site, in particular the corporate side and find the email addresses for the customer service manager, credit manager, consumer sales manager, vp of operations, etc.&nbsp; The higher up you go the better, email everyone.&nbsp; Tell them your story politely and ask for help in solving the matter.&nbsp; If you really want to lay it on heavy, tell them you are a loyal customer, but if you aren&#039;t credited for the interest, you&#039;ll be shopping Apple next time.&nbsp; Someone will credit you for your interest and maybe offer something to make up for the inconvenience.&nbsp; The lower people on the list will trip over themselves trying to help you so they can tell the higher-ups they took care of it.<br /><br />This has never failed to work for me and I&#039;ve done it at Pearle Vision (1 year free disposable contacts), Red Envelope (money refunded, plus $50 credit), Drugstore.com,&nbsp; and more.

				There is no credit card company in the United States that is ethical - not a single one. I learned the hard way that these guys do not play fair - it&#039;s all buried in the fine print I realize, but any common person doesn&#039;t read the fine print, and in most banks if you sit there and actually try and read the fine print when signing up for these financial services the customer service person will give you an evil look (as will everyone behind you). It&#039;s the perfect scam - and most people who get swindled think they are the only ones and feel too shameful to stand up for themselves - I was one of those for a long time.

Usually much better to their members than banks are to their customers. The rates aren&#039;t necessarily better, though, since they&#039;re so much smaller...

				If you have such good credit history, shop around for a 0% balance transfer offer.&nbsp; They&#039;re all over the place.&nbsp; Apply for one and transfer the balance from your computer purchase.

				Yay! Thanks for the info!&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br /><strong>GenXNYC</strong>, I scoured both the DFS and Dell corporate sites... found nada except the name of Dell&#039;s CFO. No email anything for the people you suggested. Im not surprised.<br /><br /><strong>JTrane</strong>: Thanks for the suggestion, and I was thinking about doing that. I know my regular credit card would give me a balance xfer for next-to-no-interest, but I don&#039;t have that big an outstanding balance (after making two hefty payments) to warrant the balance transfer fee. I&#039;ll own the computer outright next month anywya.<br /><br />Off to send that form now!&nbsp; :evil:

				Mark Jarvis<br />Chief Marketing Officer&nbsp; (that&#039;s what the credit offer really is, a marketing/sales program)<br /><br />Paul D. Bell<br />Senior Vice President and President, Americas<br /><br />Board_of_Directors@dell.com<br /><br />Also, I believe that the Dell email format is first.last@dell.com&nbsp; so you can try that if you like otherwise mail something from the post office.<br />

				I was going to point you to The Consumerist as well. I believe they have Dell contact info for an executive carpet bomb--and if you tell The Consumerist your story, Dell might deal with you quickly to avoid bad publicity.

				Update: After sending my paperwork to the NYS AG&#039;s office, I got a response informing me that my situation doesn&#039;t warrant being part of the class-action suit. Oh, well.....<br /><br />But: then I get another letter from them saying that they agreed to contact Dell on my behalf. Dell tried to counter whatever they communicated, but no matter. DFS credited me the interest they charged.<br /><br />So I contact Dell to tell them I wish to cancel my account, giving them the address they should send my credit to. I half expected to never see this money, but lo, and behold, I got a check. Pretty quick too.
