				Maybe this is old news, but I&#039;ve lived in Astoria for about a year. Almost EVERY night around 10 pm (and sometimes even later), there are two women (I think?) who scream bloody murder CONTINUOUSLY! <br /><br />Often this culminates in neighbors shouting across yards. Last night&#039;s screaming was between 2:15 am - 4 am. Around 2:30 am, many neighbors started yelling for them to be quiet and shut up. <br /><br />These nonstop, blood curdling screams are really aggravating (not to mention sleep depriving!)...but I don&#039;t see what can be done about them. Just curious to see if anyone else had any knowledge about them and to ensure this isn&#039;t some sort of domestic situation that requires police attention.<br /><br />

I would often have to close my windows on the hottest days of the year just to diminish the noise. I haven&#039;t heard them for a few months now and suspect that they finally moved out.&nbsp; Keep lodging noise complaints, but be careful about shouting to quiet them.&nbsp; Once after I did such a thing, I heard my doorbell ring shortly afterward.
