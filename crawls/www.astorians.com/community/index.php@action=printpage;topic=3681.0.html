				So i&#39;m trying to find info on this joint and i&#39;m coming up empty. Does anyone have the 411 on the place that was formerly Nickelodeon on Steinway between i think 28th Ave and 20th Ave? I think its called Score or something and it looks like your average big sports bar. I wanted to see what the dilly was for Sundays with football goings ons. <br />&nbsp;:-D

				i know which place you&#39;re talking about, but i only recently noticed that it changed names/themes once again.<br />when it was liquid lounge my friend had a glass thrown at her face by this drunk chick (my friend mentioned to the bartender, her friend, that this girl on the other end of the bar was really drunk and was being very beligerent and harassing other people) so the drunky launched the glass clear accross the bar. she wound up with multiple stiches on her forehead. <br />no matter what incarnation it is, i think it&#39;s gone downhill since the nickleodeon days. and after the above incident, i don&#39;t trust the clientel and you probably couldn&#39;t pay me to go in.

				From Joey in Astoria http://astorianyc.blogspot.com/ (http://astorianyc.blogspot.com/):<br /><br />Sundays bring us FOOTBALL!!!! Lucky for Astorians, there are quite a few places to stop in for a game or two. I&#39;ve walked by The Zone (28-43 Steinway) a few times and peeped their 10 or so large flatscreens and still have to try them out - you may remember it as the old Nickolodeon place on Steinway. If a big new place isn&#39;t what you&#39;re looking for then there&#39;s always the good old Irish Rover (28th Ave &amp; 38th St) and Mary McGuire&#39;s (Broadway &amp; 38th St.) which i hear has a pretty fine brunch on Sundays to boot. There you have it, no excuse to miss the game.
