				Wow, that&#039;s my home state, alright. How incredibly stupid our legislators are. You know the state will abuse the ability to look up information on buyers.<br /><br />What will they do for people who don&#039;t have a license? (Can you buy beer without a govmt approved ID?)<br /><br />&quot;Marylee Booth, executive director of the Tennessee Oil Marketers Association, which represents gas stations and convenience stores, said the intention is not to hurt vendors, but to help them protect minors.&quot;<br /><br />Right... it&#039;s all for the children!!

				Talk about a stupid law!<br /><br />1. If you look old enough to remember President Kennedy (or FDR,&nbsp; or Warren G. Harding), what&#039;s the chance that you&#039;re underage?<br /><br />2. The law covers only <em>beer</em> purchases!&nbsp; Common sense still rules in the sale of wine and liquor.<br /><br />3. Does Tennessee have a non-driver&#039;s ID, as New York State does?&nbsp; If it doesn&#039;t, then why restrict beer drinking to people licensed to operate a deadly weapon?

				The Beer Garden started using that handheld license scanner recently. I always wonder if they&#039;re capturing any data with that, or just checking birth dates. Conceivably they could keep a count of how many times a week you go there. And then give me a free pitcher now and then...

Seems rather inconsistent that they check your ID and then let a ten year old pass through.

				I was wondering about that myself.&nbsp; What if an 18 year old wanted to go in for his 22 year old brother&#039;s birthday party?&nbsp; He couldn&#039;t go in, but their 8 year old cousin could?&nbsp; Weird.
