				So it looks like my regular beer spot, Helipolis on Broadway near 33rd street, has closed up shop.&nbsp; Any other good spots nearby?

				Damn, I posted this same thing about a week ago and was really hoping that this closing was just temporary, although it was pretty obvious that it wasn&#039;t. My liver already misses them.

				For those living further north in Astoria, Best Yet (yes, I know this is far from Broadway) has a great selection of beer, too.

				I was going to mention the Bravo.&nbsp; Heliopolis was great for more obscure beers, though.&nbsp; I bought my husband a sour ale there that he adored and now we can&#039;t find it anywhere else.&nbsp; &nbsp;:cry:

				As far as I have been told by the owner,&nbsp; it is merely closed for renovation.&nbsp; Nice people, so I hope that remains the case.<br /><br />All the suggestions above are good substitutes,&nbsp; the Euro Market is open till midnight.

				Hmmm -- a couple of weeks ago one of the Heliopolis guys (not sure if it was the owner or not) said the rent was too high so they had to closed. If it was only for renovations I&#039;d be a happy girl. I loved that place and the people were really nice.

				This is veering off topic, but what is the reputation of Blue Moon drinkers?&nbsp; I had my first Blue Moon last year on Talk Like A Pirate Day.&nbsp; The Blue Moon had nothing to do with piratery, it&#039;s just the occasion on which I had it.&nbsp; I fell instantly in love with it, and have decorated my kitchen with 24 empties along the edge of my upper cabinets.&nbsp; (None, I think, should happen to fall, there&#039;s a raised edge they are behind.)
