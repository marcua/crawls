				Anyone have some great local (or non-local, or online) stores/websites with some cute, interesting, unique holiday finds? Looking for some new ideas and to not resort to amazon for everything. The Blue Eye Boutique (?) near Broadway looks like it has some cute gift ideas - any other suggestions?

				Here are a few suggestions (http://astorianyc.blogspot.com/2006/11/astoria-weekend-edition-241106.html).<br /><br />Also, Kristees on 23rd Ave (24-01 23rd Avenue).&nbsp; I got an email forwarded by the owner:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The name of the store is KrisTees and it is one of Astoria&#39;s newest additions.&nbsp; KrisTees is a unique clothing boutique nestled on the corner of 23rd Avenue and 24th Street close to Astoria park, which has only been opened now for two months.&nbsp; The store is the product of a NYC clothing designer and architect who both live in Astoria,&nbsp; designing a space that houses contemporary casual styles in a fresh, modern setting.&nbsp; The boutique mix offers relaxed basics with a twist, that makes for perfect weekend wear to dress up or dress down and make it your own. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Socrates Sculpture Park (http://www.socratessculpturepark.org/) has a new book out about their 20 years of existence.&nbsp; I know the Noguchi Museum (http://noguchi.org) has a nice gift shop/cafe (and online (http://akaristore.stores.yahoo.net/)), with wonderful books, etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also, check out Inside Astoria, on Ditmars near 38th.<br /><br />Kees Chocolates in SoHo.&nbsp; Um, YUM.<br /><br />And Threadless (http://threadless.com) tshirts online!&nbsp; Many for $10!<br /><br />Hope this helps.&nbsp;

				I just buy everything online and have it shipped to my parents and call them with strict instructions not to open them. When I arrive for xmas, I wrap the gifts. Saves me trying to get everything through security (my big goal in life is to travel with carryons only as much as possible). <br /><br />However, for Thanksgiving, I got an assortment of unusual teas from Freeze Peach for my uncle - that was very well received. I got my aunt a pound of chocolate from Neuhaus. That was VERY well received. <br />

				i have an embarassing admission... :oops:<br /><br />i got up at the crack of dawn on black friday when visiting upstate, and went shopping with the fam to Kohls.&nbsp; I got all my shopping done except for some Amazon stuff, but really, I could have gotten the same deals some other time.&nbsp; There was no need to get up that early and do this.&nbsp; Apparently people camped out from 5pm the night before at Best Buy.&nbsp; That place was a nightmare, the line was weaving in and out of the aisles all over the store.&nbsp; We walked out.<br /><br />i won&#39;t be doing this again, never did before, was curious, but even my parents have said it&#39;s not fun anymore due to the sheer amount of people<br /><br />the lines are ridiculous<br /><br />online here i come...

				I hate shopping. I know, I know, I am a woman so I am *supposed* to love it. But, I hate shopping. <br /><br />So, every time I see something, whether online or brick-and-mortar, and I think to myself, &#39;whats-his/her-name would love that&#39;, I buy it and have it in the closet ready for holiday wrapping. <br /><br />And, oh yes, the best time to buy that holiday wrapping is at the half price sales after the holidays!<br /><br />Those inevitable last minute items can be purchased online and shipped directly to the recipient with a nice little gift card.<br /><br />Did I mention I HATE SHOPPING.

				Lots of great sites!&nbsp; I can&#39;t wait to check them all out.&nbsp; I like the Union Square market - it always has interesting stuff.&nbsp; The one up at Bryant Park is pretty good too, though not as extensive, at least I don&#39;t think it was. <br />Has anyone seen interesting Santas in Astoria (or anywhere else in the city?).&nbsp; I&#39;m keeping my eyes open for them as my mom collects them, but the pickings seem very slim this year.

				I need some help, please.<br /><br />I have wracked my brain searching for one last gift, and I keep going down dead-end streets.<br /><br />Here&#39;s my problem: A 37-year old, single, liberated, very successful, straight male.<br /><br />It can&#39;t be clothes. He is somewhat of a clothes horse, and I can&#39;t afford even one of the kinds of shirts he wears. It cannot be anything for the house (kitchen, bathroom, bedroom) as he is employed by one of the largest retailers in the country and gets his 30% discount on all that stuff—besides he has everything in the world—he has a good watch and a couple of dress-down watches, doesn&#39;t wear jewelry, already has a plasma HD TV and a Bose system, and I gave him food last year. I have no idea what kinds of music he likes and his best friend is in the DVD distribution business. He *is* spoiled rotten. I have to get him something.<br /><div><span style="font-size: 15pt;" class="bbc_size"><br /><strong>HELP&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;HELP&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;HELP&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;HELP&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;HELP&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;HELP&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;HELP</strong></span></div>

				Dirk,<br /><br />I know this sounds cliche but check out the Holiday Section at Macy&#39;s.&nbsp; We have been gettng my mom one every year for years (she actually refers to these as Macy&#39;s Santas.)&nbsp; Depending on what your travel plans are I&#39;d wait until a few days before Christmas to get it as the prices are usually slashed drastically by then.&nbsp; Last year my partner went on the 22nd and got a Christopher Radko santa for over $75 off for our mom.
