				I need advice on where to get my hair cut, preferably in the Astoria/LIC area.&nbsp; <br /><br />My previous hairdresser is 5 hours upstate, and I really need a haircut!&nbsp; My hair shouldnt be hard to cut--It&#039;s just long and straight, and I like some layers cut around my face.&nbsp; I don&#039;t need it highlighted or anything like that--just cut.&nbsp; Any suggestions?&nbsp; Also, please tell me the price range if you know it.<br /><br />The only salon I&#039;ve been to here is Natura Spa on Steinway Street (for waxing).&nbsp; Has anyone gotten a hair cut there?<br /><br />Thanks in advance.

				Go to Antoinette at Saloon Salon on 30th Ave. (somewhere like 37th Street).&nbsp; I was constantly looking for a good hairdresser that wasn&#039;t too expensive.&nbsp; Everytime I go there (over a year now), my hair looks great and it&#039;s less than $50 for a wash, cut &amp; blowdry.&nbsp; I highly recommend her.

				I like SPAce, too.&nbsp; After Jean moved to Chicago, Nicki took over my haircuts, and she does a great job, too.&nbsp; $25 for wash/cut without anything else; $35 or $40 with styling/blowdry.&nbsp; It&#039;s between 31st and 29th Sts.

				Another vote for Edna!&nbsp; She has done a great job with my finicky blonde hair.&nbsp; I&#039;ll be calling her after the new year for a haircut!&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m also curious about SPAce&#039;s massages - has anyone had one there?&nbsp; I&#039;m looking for Swedish, mostly.

				I got the worst haircut in my life at SPAce about 4 years ago. Never again. They don&#039;t know how to do short haircuts. She messed up one side (too short) and had to mess up the other to balance it. Very strange experience because she turned my chair around at one point so my back was to the mirror. No haircutter had ever done that before. What a disaster. I told her I didn&#039;t like the cut. I paid (like a wimp), but didn&#039;t give her a tip and never went back. Maybe they&#039;re better now. Immagination on 23rd Ave and 29th Street is a good place. Frankie is always great. My friend swears by his brother Joey. Either one does a fantastic job. They are not too expensive-around 25 bucks.

The salons post on there to get people for their students often. I just did a search and saw several - best part is that they are actually free! I&#039;ve not tried it, but have a friend that swears by the student cuts she gets from Aveda - you can also get haircuts from students that you pay for - but I believe they are about $25 - but you get to make a convenient appointment which is not always the case with the free ones.

				OK Timarie, I&#039;ll give them a try next time I need a haircut, but to be on the safe side, I&#039;ll take a photo of the haircut I want: an old-time shag from the sixties, early 70&#039;s. Let&#039;s see if they can handle anything other than a trim and blow-out. I&#039;ll tell them they were highly recommended by other customers! If it doesn&#039;t work out I might try the Aveda place in Soho. <br /><br />Atleast hair always grows back! :-)

				I love Aveda&#039;s student program. You get a student who&#039;ll listen to what you want and give you a scalp and neck massage with your cut, all for $20.&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />I did not have a good experience with my haircut at SPAce. I went for a cut and color. The color was great, but the woman who cut my hair got booked up while I was getting the color and was really short with me when I came out front for my cut. I can understand getting booked up, so I told her I just wanted a quick trim of the ends and bangs, that I was happy with the style I had, I just needed it cleaned up, no need to blow dry or do any complicated cutting. She decided that what I wanted wasn&#039;t what I really wanted, and cut layers into my hair, &quot;shaped&quot; my bangs by cutting more hair into them and just generally ruined my hair. She also blew it out to giant proportions, which I hate and protested during the process. She told me the style would look better blown out and that it wouldn&#039;t take a long time. Considering that I asked for a trim of split ends, and I came out with the same length and razored ends (which split faster than cut hair), I was really upset. I haven&#039;t been back since. At least at Aveda, the students listen to what I want and make suggestions about what will work for my face instead of deciding to do whatever they want without consulting me at all.

				I like SPAce for haircuts.&nbsp; But, they do charge an extra $10 for long hair.&nbsp; This was revealed to me after I got my hair cut and I felt a bit aggravated by this, mostly because I didn&#039;t see it written anywhere.&nbsp; This brings up a question:&nbsp; is it commonplace to charge people with long hair extra for cutting it?&nbsp; And does SPAce post this anywhere on the wall or in their literature?&nbsp; It&#039;s completely possible that I could have just missed seeing it.&nbsp; I&#039;d love to know what others think!<br /><br />This all being said, I do love Edna&#039;s work and would return to SPAce.&nbsp; Last time I was there I also toured their SPA area and it is niiiiiiice, wow.<br /><br />That Aveda school sounds intriguing.&nbsp; I love Aveda products!

However, I think it is really bad business practice that they did not tell you beforehand. I also checked out their website and did not see see an extra charge mentioned anywhere for long hair cuts but they did mention (in really tiny letters) that color and highlights where extra depending on length. I do like them in general as a salon, but I am disappointed to hear that this occurred. Its just bad business.

				No, I haven&#039;t.&nbsp; My color is au naturale.&nbsp; And spa services get filed under &quot;splurge&quot; for me so I haven&#039;t had the funds to justify it.&nbsp; Let me know if you try it/them.&nbsp; I&#039;d be curious.
