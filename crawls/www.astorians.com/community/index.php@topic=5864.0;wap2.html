			This happens to me every so often but I come on to the site and it says &quot;Page not found&quot;.&nbsp; It did that to me today for a few hours and it&#039;s done this to me in the past.&nbsp; Any ideas why?&nbsp; :|

			It does it for the main site, or when you&#039;re already on astorians and click on another page?

			I use firefox and I use tabbed browsing.&nbsp; I have other sites loaded in each tab and when I opened a new tab today and typed in www.astorians.com I came here without a problem.&nbsp; I was on the site for some time since I had it in it&#039;s own tab,&nbsp; Going back and forth between tabs, I came back to the board and it kept on saying &#039;page not found&#039;.&nbsp; I closed the tab and opened&nbsp; new one and did the same thing.&nbsp; page not found.&nbsp; It did this to me for hours.&nbsp; I came home and figured I&#039;d check it and it was fine.&nbsp; This happens to me quite often.&nbsp; I also have free web surfing reign at work so it&#039;s not like the site is being blocked.&nbsp; It just doesn&#039;t find the page.&nbsp; It&#039;s happened to me here at home, as well.&nbsp; <br /><br />I always found it odd that after this happened no one ever inquired about it.&nbsp; I figured that that happening is what you guys meant as &quot;time outs&quot; but no one would type in those threads after it happened so I wonder who it&#039;s happening to.&nbsp; It can&#039;t just be me from 2 different computers in 2 different locations.<br /><br />I just thought I&#039;d bring it to your attention.&nbsp; &nbsp;:|

			Is anyone else experiencing this regularly? As far as I know the server hasn&#039;t been down.

			It has happened to me at least once a day for the past several weeks.
