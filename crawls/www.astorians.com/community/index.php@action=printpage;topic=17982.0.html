				usually production will just move the cars to a spot on a nearby street. which still sucks for them, but at least they don&#039;t have to pay to get the car out.

				Channing Tatum!

				I for one am ready for the Channing Tatum fiasco to be done filming at Ditmars.&nbsp; The people working on the set are so obnoxious and wading through 300 spectators while I&#039;m trying to get home is not my idea of a good time.&nbsp; Seriously, if they need to close off three of the five subway exits shouldn&#039;t they film in the middle of the night rather than during rush hour?
