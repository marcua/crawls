			Starting a catch all thread for the next year to post things that make me chuckle about politics. I hope others will join me. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />What I learned today. <br /><br /><br />Ann Coulter is not a fan of the French Revolution (She compared it to OWS). <br /><br /><br />Herman Cain is leading in a poll (You GOPers really hate Romney). <br /><br /><br />Mitch McConnell is the actual leader of the Senate - Think about it...nothing can even be debated without his approval. <br /><br /><br />ALL REGULATIONS ARE BAD....oh and they are job killers. I guess that includes the regulations covering coal mines. In 1907,&nbsp; 3242 miners died.....in 1910, Congress creates the Mine Safety and Health Administration. Since then, deaths have fallen to 33 in 2007. Cause and effect anyone????????<br /><br /><br />Oh, and I dare you to goggle Santorum.

			According to Open Secrets, our two Senators have 16 million combined Cash on Hand. <br /><br /><br />Romney is not a conservative....via Rush. <br /><br /><br />A woman being forced to drive from hospital to hospital while her uterus is bleeding is more important than jobs. <br /><br /><br />284 days since Speaker Boehner took over....WHEEERRREEEE AAARRREEEE THHHHHHE JOOOOOOOOBS<br /><br /><br />999 turned upside down is 666. <br /><br /><br />Should be an interesting day at OWS tomorrow. <br /><br /><br />Night all. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
