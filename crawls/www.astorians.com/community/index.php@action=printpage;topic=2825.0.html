				well last night xahc was going to work and took the train at the Astoria Blvd station-around midnight he said there was a manhole fire. He had to tell the cops up on the platform to go downstairs and check on it cause there was noone around. Not sure where this affected but right now, no doubt everywhere kinda sucks&nbsp; :x<br />

				I saw a report on NY1 this morning that there are power problems in Red Hook and Sunset Park today.&nbsp; Is the power back on up around Ditmars?&nbsp; I&#39;d heard they were having outages last night.

				I&#39;m near Steinway &amp; Ditmars, and I&#39;ve had full power all last night and so far today.<br /><br />Of course, as soon as I hit &quot;post&quot;, it&#39;ll probably go out&nbsp; :roll:

				Yup.&nbsp; 31st St btwn Ditmars and 21st Ave.&nbsp; Mostly full power, but AC wasn&#39;t pumping to full capacity.&nbsp; My guess is that Con Ed has decreased power output to avoid over stressing the system.&nbsp; I doubt they&#39;d ever admit it, though.

				30th ave/38th st.:<br /><br />Ditto to a lot of you--seemed like full power but the AC didn&#39;t seem to be cooling the room very well.&nbsp; It was working, the air was definitely not quite as hot as elsewhere in the apartment, but it was still hot in there for hours.&nbsp; However, when I woke up it was quite cool, so the power may have been increased to full.<br /><br />I&#39;m worried that I may have accidentally left my AC on when I went to work.&nbsp; I turned it down to very low (i.e., thermostat to very high temp) when I got up, and I think because it was so low I forgot it was on.

Well, there&#39;s nothing you can do about it now (unless you have a roommate that&#39;s home), and at least its set to a higher temp and not sucking up as much electricity as it could be. It would have been much worse if it was still set to the lower temp and you forgot it was on. If you wanna make up for it, go home after work, turn off the AC, and then go out with friends or to a movie theater, so AC can sit idle for at least a few hours today.

				The A/C might have just been underpowered, even if ConEd was giving you the full amount of juice. If it&#39;s very hot outside, it&#39;s hard for the A/C to dump the heat into the outside air. The huge A/C in my kitchen runs off of 220 V, and sucks some painfully large number of Watts, so it&#39;s been working, but I&#39;d totally believe that a low-capacity A/C with 5000 BTUs would be pretty useless when it&#39;s 105 outside... Blowing 90 degree air into the house isn&#39;t that helpful!<br />

				Astoria Blvd &amp; 28th Street loosing power? Isn&#39;t that near the location for that proposed 15 story HANAC building? <br /><br />At least some think the parking is taken care of:<br /><br />http://www.qgazette.com/news/2006/0524/features/010.html<br />http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/pdf/cpc/060168.pdf<br /><br />BTW, <br /><br />Huge halogen lights on the East River bathing Big Alis in intense light in the past few nights. Looks like a countdown for a NASA launch. Conservation, right? <br /><br />Now they are telling us to conserve on power use. What happened to all those sanguine comments we have plenty of power last week? What will happen with 1000s of new units come on line in a few years?<br /><br />Don&#39;t forget this experience when they tell you everything is ok in about 6 weeks!

				I&#39;m pretty sure we aren&#39;t at full voltage here (31st St &amp; 21st Ave, how many of us are there on this corner?? heh). I have a brand-new 11,000 BTU unit (energy star) and, while I know it was hot as the 12th level of hell yesterday, it never got my living room lower than a breezy 78 degrees ... plus lights have been dim since Monday. <br /><br />In the end though, I&#39;ll take low juice over none. Fingers crossed. (And from what I can tell, all else is normal out on 31st/Ditmars for now, too).

				After the power went out the first time last month I bought two of these (they&#39;re surprisingly powerful):<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009V6IGK/102-9014655-6076940<br /><br />And a bunch of buy-one-get-one-free &#39;D&#39; batteries at Rite Aid to power them:<br /><br />http://www.riteaid.com/weekly_ad/detail_item.php?t_nbr=T64956&amp;circ_id=1078&amp;page=11<br /><br />Crossing my fingers that I don&#39;t have to use them now.<br /><br />Goodnight.
