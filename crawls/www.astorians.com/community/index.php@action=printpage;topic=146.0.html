				There are three operas I'd like to see at the Met this fall: &nbsp;Tannhauser, The Tales of Hoffman, and Kat'ya Kabanova. &nbsp;<br /><br />Is anyone else interested in buying nose-bleed seats and hashing plot, musical structure, etc afterward over shiraz? &nbsp;Talk to me.

				Allow me to elaborate (and, in the process, kill some downtime while I wait for a meeting to start and some proofreading to find its way to my desk). &nbsp;Or, you can check out www.metopera.com. &nbsp;Cheap seats are something like $36. &nbsp;<br /><br />Tannhauser is by Richard Wagner. &nbsp;Don't get scared. &nbsp;Tannhauser isn't The Ring and the Valkyries don't show. &nbsp;Just Elizabeth (the beautiful and good daughter of the landgrave) and Venus (everything you'd expect from a goddess with a name like that) who represent the polar opposites between which the main character is torn (asceticism and hedonism). &nbsp;Tannhauser is a talented minstrel, but a tad offensive to the good people of ... whatever that village is. &nbsp;In the midst of a village talent show, he tears into a bawdy ballad praising the voluptuous charms of Venus. &nbsp;Call the censors! &nbsp;Really, the music is my favorite part - particularly the pilgrim's chorus - but this opera is a hotbed of discussion topics. <br /><br />Yes, Wagner had a nasty side to his personality. &nbsp;Still, his music is amazing, Tannhauser isn't as long as a Ring opera and doesn't require the same level of commitment, and is a good way to explore a fundamental question: &nbsp;how a racist nut job can manage to create out a profound work on love, redemption, sacrifice and humanity. &nbsp;<br /><br />Still no meeting.<br /><br />The Tales of Hoffman (Offenbach) Hoffman has very, very bad luck with love. &nbsp;But the music is very nice. &nbsp;I listened to this on CD a long time ago but I've fogotten about most of it. &nbsp;Hoffman has to chose between a real woman and his muse. &nbsp;Given his track record with women, he should go with the Muse. &nbsp;You can read the synopsis here. &nbsp;http://www.metopera.org/synopses/hoffman.html<br /><br />Kat'ya I know nothing about, except that it's by Leos Janacek, a Czech composer. &nbsp;The libretto is taken from a play by Ostrovsky and the synopsis reminds me of Lady MacBeth of the Mtsensk District - a young wife is tempted when her husband goes on a business trip, is mistreated by her in-laws, takes a lover, and suffers dire consequences. &nbsp;I've seen The Cunning Little Vixen, also by Janacek, and it was good. &nbsp;<br /><br />The meeting is now 20 minutes late - still no proofreading, either!

				............my favorite part is where Elmer Fudd sings: &quot;Kill the Waaabit, kill the Waaaaabit&quot;......oh, that would be 'Wide of the Walkeries...'<br /><br />(I believe Mark Twain said: &quot;Wagner's music isn't as bad as it sounds...&quot;) :wink: <br /><br />Actually I always wanted to see Tannhauser....what is the $?...hey, I'm a sucker for big blonde chicks in breast plates and helmets....but again that would be the 'Ring'....wouldn't it?

				Family circle tickets are actually $26. &nbsp;I was thinking about going Friday, since I'm not going home for Thanksgiving. &nbsp;The more expensive seats seem to be selling out at quite a rate, but there might still be some cheap seats available.
