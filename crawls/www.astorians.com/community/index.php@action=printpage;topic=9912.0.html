				Hi Astorians my name is Richard and my partners and I wanted to introduce ourselves to the community board.&nbsp; We heard about this resource from a few people and we see there is already some contraversy regarding Winegasm and previous posts so we thought we would adress them personally :-).&nbsp; &nbsp;We are three wine enthusiasts and our motivation from the beginning was to build a beautiful wine bar with wonderful food that would truly become a homebase to all members of the community.&nbsp; We see from the feedback regarding our name that our intentions may have been misinterpreted so I just wanted to clear a few things up.&nbsp; The name came from a definition in the urban dictionary, it goes as follows: &quot; The sensation of Euphoria over finding and experiencing the perfect bottle of wine, sought after for its region, make, or price. reveling in its first taste, while appreciating its rarity leading to a moment of pure bliss.&quot;&nbsp; So in short it&#039;s just a name and the interior is actually, at least we feel, really beautiful.&nbsp; We have built this place from the ground up and have put so much heart into it that we hope it will show when you come and see it.&nbsp; Now about the place itself...it has a rustic feel with exposed brick walls and intricate wood work.&nbsp; The wine list is approachable yet ecclectic and the food is a tapas style menu with a French and Mediteranean influence.&nbsp; We have communal tables as well as intimate seating in order to reinforce the sense of community we were hoping for.&nbsp; We would love for everyone to come down, we are having a soft opening this Saturday (a limited menu will be available we are perfecting it) but come down for some wine and cocktails everything will be half price.&nbsp; We are really excited about this new venture in our lives and would love to share it with you.&nbsp; Thanks for your support!&nbsp; To check out the menu and winelist go to winegasmeatery.com.<br /><br />-Richard, Laris, and Dean

				Richard, I hope u don&#039;t mind that I cut and pasted and edited (to make shorter) your post on the Jackson Heights Life site also.&nbsp; I&#039;m not the only one there looking for a wine bar close by.&nbsp; You&#039;re opening this coming Sat, the 29th???<br /><br />PS I went to your website and there was no link for menus etc. just a contact and map.&nbsp;

				Richard, I don&#039;t mean to sound critical but do you plan on expanding the wine list?&nbsp; It seems somewhat limited.&nbsp; For example, I am a fan of the Chardonnay and it surprises me that a wine bar would only have one option for Chardonnay by the glass and by the bottle.

				Also I just wanted to say thank you to Buddy for posting this thread on the Jackson Heights website as well.&nbsp; We want people from all over to come down.&nbsp; And yes the soft opening is this Saturday March 29th, some choice items from the menu will be available, and of course wine.&nbsp; We are by the way open to suggestions, our goal again is to make this the community&#039;s place, somewhere you can be a regular and call home, so please give us your feedback after the opening.&nbsp; Thank you!

				Regarding the name, I did actually google &quot;winegasm&quot; after the other thread was posted and I found that urban dictionary definition. I still don&#039;t like the word, but I generally do not like any case where someone takes &quot;gasm&quot; and adds some other word to it in instances like these, like shoegasm or eargasm. Grammatically it doesn&#039;t make any sense, and otherwise it just annoys me. You may call me no fun if you want, but that is my opinion of the word/name &quot;Winegasm.&quot;&nbsp; :-P<br /><br />However, the place does sound very nice. Thanks for posting about it.

				I&#039;d also like to add that deciding the name of a restaurant or establishment based upon UrbanDictionary seems equivilant to researching a paper on Wikipedia.<br /><br />The place sounds great. The name, IMO, is a poor choice.

				And that would be your right to do so.&nbsp; But not everyone thinks the same way, and everyone has their own opinions.&nbsp; To me, quality of service and food trumps name, and I&#039;ll try anything once.&nbsp; And now I have to get back to work.&nbsp; I really don&#039;t need to be contributing to a name debate.&nbsp; Woops.

				Earlier this evening I walked past the place.&nbsp; The new awning is up with the aforementioned name in lit prominence against a dark background.&nbsp; Butcher paper over the glass to hide the spiffing-up work going on inside.<br /><br />As for it&#039;s presence in that location it replaces some other mono-ethnicity joint who&#039;s big calling card was that according to the old awning you could find it in multiple world cities.&nbsp; However, I kinda doubt I would have gone out of my way in any of them to attend.&nbsp; Maybe the new inhabitant of the space will inspire me to enter.<br /><br />- Cannibal

We would hate to miss the opportunity to personally meet everyone who steps inside our little venue. Also, next week we are planning several events and we hope that all of you who expressed interest in our place will get a chance to come by and say hi!

				My fiance and I checked out the &#039;soft&#039; opening last night and I have to say I was <em>very</em> impressed!&nbsp; The owners were incredibly sweet and willing to chat and discuss their wine list with us, which was good because they didn&#039;t have a Cabernet by the glass, which is practically the only wine my fiance drinks! :-)&nbsp; He wound up getting a Syrah that was absolutely delicious based on a recommendation, and loved it so much he got a second glass.&nbsp; Their Montepulciano by the glass is really nice, light and refreshing.&nbsp; The chef is also really nice, and walked around talking to people while they tasted his food.&nbsp; They were serving food off of the small shares portion of the menu last night, and everything was delicious--if I had to pick a favorite, I think it&#039;d be the &#039;gasm dip, which (and this may sound perverted) is aptly named!&nbsp; I only wish they&#039;d have served more crackers with it.&nbsp; The shrimp were also absolutely delicious...they have tarragon in them which is one of my all-time favorite herbs, and the sauce reminded me of scampi.&nbsp; All in all, despite the name hate going on, I think this place is a great addition to the neighborhood and I hope they stick around.&nbsp; Considering the fact that it&#039;s stumbling distance from my apartment I know I&#039;ll be back!

				I&#039;m sorry we missed the opening last night - but we&#039;ll certainly be trying out this spot in the near future. <br /><br />I just want to thank Rich for being so honest and forthcoming in his original post - no BS post pretending to be a patron or whatever.&nbsp; I hope other owners take note and learn a lesson here.<br /><br />Question - does this place have an outdoor area?&nbsp; Streetside or garden?&nbsp; <br /><br />Lastly - I&#039;m sure my mom and dad would both be thrilled to go to Winegasm but I might be a little shy about bringing them there.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-D<br /><br />Best of luck and welcome to the neighborhood. <br /><br />Jen

				hi Jen,<br />Thanks for the comment about the post, we are just trying to be ourselves and nothing else. Regarding your question about the outdoor seating we are in the process of applying for a side walk cafe license for about 16 seats, however before we finalize this we want to pass a petition in the surrounding neighborhood to see if people would be ok with the idea.<br />Let me know what you guys think !!!<br />I almost forgot to mention, in response to the question about the menu, we will be offering during the course of the next week a larger selection of dishes with the objective of having our full menu by Saturday night. A slow reving up if you will.<br />That&#039;s all, thanks to everybody for the interest it is nice to see that there is such a sense of community here in Astoria as i am a recent transfuge from Manahattan.<br />Richard

				I think a sidewalk cafe on 37th Street would be fine and probably well received.&nbsp; Mundo over on 32nd Street has a sidewalk cafe and it&#039;s a nice addition, same with Tierras Colombianas on Broadway at 33rd and Omonia, diagonally across the intersection, same with Avenue up on 30th Avenue (36th Street?).<br /><br />I can&#039;t wait to try Winegasm - it sounds really wonderful.

				nice location- 37th street is on fire (and stumbling distance!)- too bad it&#039;s closed today or i&#039;d schedule a late lunch, especially as the prices seem really fair, plus a discount.<br />Good luck getting the sidewalk permit!<br />i find it surprising that a term like &quot;winegasm&quot; is controversial in any cybercommunity, (though I have spent great lengths of time naming things and considered the various points raised) but it&#039;s way cool you all seem open about how you feel. <br />an operative website is a big plus, though I couldn&#039;t find the &quot;view this page with the sound off&quot; link, so I used the mute button on my keyboard.<br />I hope the kitchen really stays open that late regularly-I&#039;m sick of not finding anything to eat after midnight (yes, i know about diners but that&#039;s not what i mean).<br />see you there unknown neighbors...<br />

				rich23, Glad to hear you changed it to 11a.m. Not that 1/2 hour&#039;s difference is that big, but someone over the phone at your place said 11:30 to me today when I called to see if you were open this Sunday. If you do consider the hours again, earlier would be even better&nbsp; :mrgreen: if you want to beat your competition for brunch near Broadway (Locale, Margaritaville, also open at 11 a.m. and Michael&#039;s is open 24/7). Thanks for keeping us all informed and can&#039;t wait to check out your digs!

				Went to Winegasm last night with my BF and the wine was definitely delicious and I loved the atmosphere. My only gripe is that the appetizers were very tiny. We ordered two spreads (the goat cheese and tomato spread and the roasted red peppers, smoked chicken and haricot vert spread) and both were served on two little narrow crackers. Both were very yummy, but don&#039;t really justify being $4-$6 each IMHO. I highly recommend making the portions a little bigger -- especially if you&#039;re sharing.&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Finally tried this place and I have to say that I am, sadly, disappointed.&nbsp; I live less than 2 blocks away and have been really excited about its opening - it&#039;s taken me so long because I just haven&#039;t been in a wine mood lately.&nbsp; That being said here are my comments:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; It&#039;s GORGEOUS!&nbsp; It&#039;s so beautiful - it&#039;s so totally different than anything else here in Astoria.&nbsp; I&#039;m very impressed with the atmosphere.<br />2.&nbsp; We decided to get a bottle of white but I didn&#039;t want anything sweet - so I asked the waitress for advice.&nbsp; While I wasn&#039;t expecting the expertise of a sommelier I think it&#039;s reasonable to expect the wait staff to really KNOW the characteristics of the very small wine list they have.&nbsp; She seemed confused by my question and could only recommend 2 out of 13 white wines that wouldn&#039;t be sweet.&nbsp; Really?&nbsp; Out of 13 whites only 2 weren&#039;t sweet?&nbsp; And here&#039;s the kicker:&nbsp; the wine she recommended that we chose was SUPER fruity - not sweet, really, but over the top fruity - really should have been told that before hand.<br />3.&nbsp; We ordered 2 apps and a mixed platter of meats and cheese.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a.&nbsp; App 1 was bacon wrapped prunes.&nbsp; I had these as a mise en bouche in France last year and loved them so much I make them at my dinner parties now.&nbsp; These were good - my bf said he liked mine better.&nbsp; I would recommend these even though they didn&#039;t knock my socks off.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;b.&nbsp; App 2 was Tiger shrimp in garlic and pepper sauce.&nbsp; WOW.&nbsp; That sounds good doesn&#039;t it?&nbsp; It really wasn&#039;t that great.&nbsp; First off, they weren&#039;t tiger shrimp - too small for that.&nbsp; Secondly, the sauce was basically watered down wing sauce - I KID YOU NOT.&nbsp; I think there were MAYBE 3 shrimp on the plate (covered with a lot of garnish) and this cost $10!&nbsp; There was also a sliced roll for dipping and it tasted freezer-burnt.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;c.&nbsp; The platter.&nbsp; They have these meat and cheese platters for $4 to $6 each and you can combine any 3 for $15.&nbsp; We ordered smoked duck, maple ham, and a French cheese called Petit Basque.&nbsp; Everything on the platter tasted great.&nbsp; The smoked duck was sublime, the ham was sliced perfectly (I believe thin slicing enhances the ham tasting experience), and the cheese was quite nice.&nbsp; HOWEVER, for $15 I was shocked by the small portions.&nbsp; There were only 2 very, very small slices of cheese on the platter - they were about the size of a small tortilla chip in dimensions.&nbsp; Is this worth $6 (the price of the cheese plate by itself)?&nbsp; The cheese was good but that was ridiculous.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think this place is beautiful and I think they have some worthy foods.&nbsp; I would not recommend this place to anyone watching their budget because I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a good value.&nbsp; If you have a fair amount of disposable income to blow on a night out to try a pretty place I say go for it.&nbsp; Otherwise, I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll be talking this place up.<br />

				I am a huge fan of wine bars and wine in general&nbsp; :mrgreen: - I especially love places where I can order some delicious grub ... so this place really suits me. Plus I really love the fact that all these cool places are opening up in the neighborhood. I had some great dishes at this place so far &gt;&gt; some favorites have been their specials such as the grilled salmon, mussels in a beer sauce, gasm dip, ricotta panckakes (AMAZING) and my usual late night drinking trying to be healthy companion, the salmon sandwich. I pretty much love all different kinds of wine but my favorite on their wine list is the Malbec Terra Rosa from Argentina ... that wine is definitely winegasm in a sip. And though I am a little challenged in the spelling dept&nbsp; :cry: I am absolutely obsessed with their dessert Tannat wine ... it tastes like pure chocolate.... Overall since I am from a far away land .. I really like coming there … it makes me feel like I am at home again.

				I was there last night with a couple of friends and we had a great time!&nbsp; We tried a number of wines and all were absolutely delicious.&nbsp; I drank more than I usually do, because of how good they were.<br /><br />I can&#039;t tell you what my favorite wine was because they were all excellent.&nbsp; We had a sparkling white, two reds, a two dessert wines.&nbsp; I would say that the most striking was the dark red dessert wine from Uruguay we had (that&#039;s the Tannat that tennat refers to above).&nbsp; We ate it with bits of walnut bread, blue cheese, walnuts and red grapes, and the combination was phenomenal.&nbsp; My friends and I all agreed that the wine would have been great on vanilla bean ice cream.<br /><br />Food-wise, my favorite things both involved bacon - the mac and cheese topped with bacon and the bacon-wrapped prunes.&nbsp; I also liked the gasm dip and the lavash was a nice touch.&nbsp; Also remarkable was the molten chocolate cake with spearmint gelato.&nbsp; We loved how the mint gelato complemented the chocolate cake.<br /><br />I walked home tipsy and happy.&nbsp; Was concerned a little that I would pass out so hard that it would be difficult to get up this morning for my marathon training run, but I had a really good 4 miles!&nbsp; I believe the wine was of such good quality that it was not conducive to the evil hangover (I am a lightweight when it comes to drinking).&nbsp; <br /><br />One other thing that I absolutely loved was that the music was played at a reasonable level.&nbsp; We could hear it alright, but we could also easily hear each other in conversation.&nbsp; For me, this is very important.&nbsp; I don&#039;t do well in places with super loud music, so this was a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />The space was very nice and I felt comfortable there.&nbsp; All the suggestions and information given to us during the evening were really good - they really know their stuff.&nbsp; Thank you, Dean.<br /><br />So, check it out!&nbsp; I recommend it.

				I think people are being a bit hasty in boycotting this place when it&#039;s possible the owners aren&#039;t even aware of what happened. Maybe the waiter didn&#039;t know how to handle the situation, and yes, he did so poorly. In any case, if your only method of complaining about it is by posting about it here, that waiter might never understand what he did wrong, the owners won&#039;t know what happened, nothing will get fixed, and they will wonder why they suddenly don&#039;t have as many customers.

				How was the food?&nbsp; I&#039;m disappointed to hear the service was a letdown, but thanks for letting us know.&nbsp; I met the owners while passing by once and they did seem really cool, though young and perhaps a little green at bar/restaurant ownership.&nbsp; <br />Oh and can we talk about this:&nbsp; What an aweful name for a bar!&nbsp; Winegasm!?&nbsp; so tacky.<br />

				I have been there many times and always have great service. s___ happens, maybe it was an accident but I would definitely speak to one of the owners and I am positive they would hook you up with something - they really care about the place, they would likely amend the situation. Its a great, fun and chilled joint and I would definitely not suggest a boycott :))) Give it a chance and let me know what happens...Next time just ask for a manager on the spot.<br /><br />Cheers!<br /><br />

				i had a sammich there which wasn&#039;t orgasmic (haha) but it hit the just split a bottle of wine spot. the appetizer and &quot;small plate&quot; items are imho a rip off for what you get for the cost. i&#039;m not on my computer that has the pictures i took when i was there but i&#039;ll see if i can get them posted for a visual. just be careful what you order. anything that sounds like it&nbsp; could be small will be and you&#039;ll feel hosed. i knew that going in so i was fine but my friend did not heed my warning. so i didn&#039;t feel hosed, i felt satisfied.<br />there&#039;s a review on the foodista website and it has pictures.

				They have a carrot and white bean dip on the menu.&nbsp; We all found it absolutely repulsive.&nbsp; The smell, texture and taste.&nbsp; Baby food straight out of the jar.&nbsp; But as overrated as crab cakes are these days, this place makes one of the better crab cakes we&#039;ve had in a very long time.&nbsp; But for being people who don&#039;t often balk at prices, the bill was pretty steep for what we had.&nbsp; The atmosphere is very nice.&nbsp; But the service was off for us as well.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t say friendly and welcoming.&nbsp; Almost a little off putting.&nbsp; And only one woman behind the bar.&nbsp; She was fine with pouring wine.&nbsp; But order a mixed drink and forget it.&nbsp; You&#039;d get a drink faster at an AA Meeting than what this woman was capable of.&nbsp; I think it seems extreme to boycott the place or feel that strongly about it.&nbsp; But none of us who went that night have ever expressed the desire to go back since.

				I walked by this weekend and met one of the owners or managers (wasn&#039;t certain which).&nbsp; The menu looks appealing and as folks have mentioned, the space is gorgeous.&nbsp; He was very friendly and I think I&#039;m trying the place next week.

				I went there for the first time this weekend and had an opposite experience to some of the other posters.&nbsp; Perhaps they are still working out the kinks.&nbsp; My food was good, had a great bottle of Riesling, and the staff was attentive.&nbsp; I will say that it was early on Saturday evening, so it wasn&#039;t crowded at all.&nbsp; Might make a difference.&nbsp; But overall, I was impressed.&nbsp; It&#039;s a nice addition to the neighborhood.

				Hello fellow Astorians! <br />This posting has recently been brought up to our attention. It seemed like something we would personally like to respond to. Firstly, we’d like to apologize to the person who was asked by our waiter to move to another table for that inconvenience. Although we are a small place, we try to accommodate as many patrons as we can given our size, moving to another table happens very rarely, going up or down a chair on our communal table maybe slightly more often but even that is rare…Regardless, it should always be assisted by one of the staff and handled in a way common in the service industry. So we would really like to invite the person who wrote the original posting to come join us again here at winegasm(our treat!) to provide him/her with a much better dining experience, one they’ll hopefully have good memories of.<br />Secondly, our food is something we have worked on a lot in the past and right now our kitchenette is headed for a second change since we opened&nbsp; (6 months) it will feature more of a fall /winter selection of small and larger plates better suited for a small wine and cocktail bar / eatery. This edition will have many great suggestions and ideas we got from our patrons. Lastly, all of us at Winegasm are working very hard to deserve Your attention and our little spot in a vast array of culinary choices in New York City and Astoria and we hope that with the addition of our tasty fall/winter cocktail list, expansion of our wine list (which will now include flights of wine as well) and a revamped menu under the helm of our new chef, our efforts are going to be recognized.<br />Cheers Everyone!<br />Laris, Richard and Dean<br />

				I&#039;ve been there on several occassions and I&#039;ve never been disappointed.&nbsp; I&#039;ve always enjoyed the food and the staff has been really great.&nbsp; I&#039;m sorry that a few people didn&#039;t have a good experience, but that could happen anywhere.&nbsp; Give the place another shot....it is a real nice addition to the neigborhood.

				I finally tried it out today.&nbsp; The space inside is beautiful, very well done.&nbsp; The skylight is a nice touch and it&#039;s very artistic.&nbsp; The staff are extremely friendly and accommodating and treated us very well - we were a party of four which morphed into a party of five and they were very gracious.&nbsp; Winegasm has a pre-fixe brunch for just over $15, which includes THREE mimosas (you read that right, three full size mimosas - and they were tasty!).&nbsp; I had the chicken sandwich which was nice and the rest of my group had pancakes and french toast (which looked the best of all of our choices, it came with nutella!).&nbsp; It&#039;s a great addition to the area - go check them out!

				My boyfriend and I did dinner there last night - the mac and cheese with Canadian bacon is extremely good.&nbsp; The service is very attentive and they are one of the friendliest places to go in Astoria, they were packed last night, but the food arrived quickly and we had a great experience.&nbsp; Try their mulled wine if you get the chance - it was very well done.

				My roommate and I had brunch at Winegasm last Sunday and it was delicious!&nbsp; We had the croque madame (which I found out is a croque-monsieur plus a fried egg) and the quiche, with a side of potatoes - both dishes were generous portions, and we loved the mimosa deal!&nbsp; <br /><br />The waitstaff and owner were very gracious and accommodating.&nbsp; They were busy, and the food took a few extra minutes, but we were pleasantly surprised when we were offered some amuse-bouche while we waited.&nbsp; We will be going back to try out their dinner menu shortly!

				Me and some friends went there recently. We ordered a pitcher of sangria and couple appetizers. The food was was good but very little for what you pay for, and the sangria was way to sweet. Great decor and friendly staff. Would not go back, found a spot at vine and crescent were you get much more bang for your buck.

				Hmmm... well it is a little bit strange since we haven&#039;t served any Sangria @ WGM since late september, but if your recent visit was in fact back 3 months ago I&#039;d just like to say that a lot of things on our menu have changed since and it is now completely available for sharing / family style with a better price point&nbsp; and quantity ratio.So I&#039;d like to wholeheartedly invite you to come by and take a look at it again.. I believe that You are going to find this new changes very exciting and affordable. Best Wishes...<br />Laris

				I visited about a week ago with a couple of friends and had a great experience.&nbsp; As someone else noted, the crab cakes are delish---you can really taste the crab itself as opposed to just filler.&nbsp; The dish with shrimp and sausage was wonderful as well.&nbsp; The cocktail I ordered was not really to my liking, but they were quick to ask if I wanted something else instead.&nbsp; This place is very warm and quaint and it sounds like the management is working on some positive improvements :mrgreen:
