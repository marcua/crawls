				A few days now.&nbsp; Never could figure out how any ice cream place can survive winters.

				More than a few days - I recall seeing it closed before Xmas.<br /><br />Sad about that, not just because it was a family owned franchise and one of the few freestanding B-Rs around, but it&#039;s also yet piece of my Astoria childhood gone. I remember being so excited to get the postcard in the mail around my birthday every year and walking up to Steinway with my parents for my free cone. It was also the only place that still made the clown cones and the only BR in the area that carries my favorite flavor every summer, pink bubblegum.

				OTOH good for the cold stone creamery if they open up, less competition.<br /><br />I did not grow up here (resident for more than 20 years) but miss the Carvel ice cream place on Steinway.&nbsp; Used to get ice cream there in the dead of winter, so I would not have to worry about it melting on the way home.

				I don&#039;t live near that location, but I like eating ice cream in winter.&nbsp; You just take it somewhere you won&#039;t freeze while eating it.

				That Baskin Robbins was there forever!&nbsp; We used to go there after catching a movie at the UA movie theater across 30th Avenue.&nbsp; Can&#039;t believe it&#039;s gone.<br /><br />I also remember the Carvel on Steinway off 28th Ave.&nbsp; Had a very old school look, and I believe was one of the last if not the last, freestanding Carvels in the City.<br /><br />Didn&#039;t the Cold Stone on Broadway and 34th Street close?

				I used to love the irony of it being located right near the Astoria Weight Watchers center, which used to be above the bedding/bath store on Steinway (can&#039;t remember the name of that store).<br /><br /><br />I remember thinking it was good that my willpower was strong with Baskin Robbins, Rizzos Pizza and Dunkin Donutes all within a stone&#039;s throw of Weight Watchers……<br /><br />
