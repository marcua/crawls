				I know that it&#39;s a bit early, but does anyone know the date and time of the fireworks at Astoria Park?&nbsp; The 4th is on a Tuesday this year and I know that they like to schedule it closer to the weekend.&nbsp;

				There are fireworks in Astoria Park on June 29, 2006 (Thursday) (http://centralastoria.org/news.htm), but I don&#39;t know whether there will be additional fireworks closer to the 4th or not.&nbsp; That link also has other Astoria calendar events for the summer, including the 2006 Waterfront Concert Series, also in Astoria Park, a listing of street fairs, and the Summer Fun Children&#39;s Series.

				Has anyone been to Gantry Plaza State Park for the Macy&#39;s 4th of July fireworks? I was thinking of going there this year for something new, but I assume it gets packed early. Any advice?

				I haven&#39;t been there, but besides the fireworks in Astoria Park, there are also ones that are done off of Randalls Island which are quite nice too.&nbsp; Last year they were done the 1-2 days before Macy&#39;s, but I don&#39;t know when they&#39;re scheduled for this year.&nbsp;

				Last year, I went into Manhattan, found a nice spot on the FDR Drive, leaned on the railing, and watched them shoot off the rockets from one of the several barges in the river.&nbsp; Really great display.&nbsp; So cool being able to see the actual launch.&nbsp; I love fire(works).

				The people at Queens West block the access to most of Gantry Park on July 4 (tickets are given out in the building lobbies to tennants). <br /><br />Get used to it. You can forget about most of the waterfront after development.<br /><br />For example, Silvercup is giving 40 feet (yes 40 feet) for their gigantic project - when Stu Suna at a recent meeting was reminded that this tiny strip would not fit the thousands in his building alone, he just smiled and went on about his &quot;public access and jobs creation project.&quot;<br /><br />Its a shame that the waterfront programs put together this summer is doing very little to educate us on the wonderful waterfront we are about to lose: considering the population of the surrounding area, rather few people (outside of the projects) attend those events. A guess the waterfront agenda is set by Goodwill Industries.<br /><br />And as to Astoria Park, a small clique unfortunately controls that (remember the stupid brou-ha-ha last year when they dicided to put a tennis bubble over the courts - it would attract outsiders (gasp) to the park)!!<br /><br />Fortunately the clique that controls that park is lacking in the imagination department. Afterall, Peters doing Elvis was stale in 1988.<br /><br />But I bet they expect the community will remain passive.

				You have a problem with wanting taxes spent wisely or civic involvement by the public? Or should one just be worn down and passive as our &#39;betters&#39; decide what we should do and whom we should salute?<br /><br />Does the novel experience of someone from western Queens asking questions make the elites unsettled? Heavens, what would happen if the public rediscovers that civic inquiry is fun?<br /><br />Suggest you go over to Bohemian Hall and Park today, my friend, and wonder what it would have looked like as a garage, or 7 story building as our &#39;leadership&#39; suggested a decade ago.<br /><br />Then come back and share with us your thoughts.

				Gatorboy is right!&nbsp; &nbsp;Unless people start to stand up and yell they want access to the waterfront, you can kiss it goodbye.&nbsp; It will surely wind up to be a place for the wealthy.&nbsp; People have to start to take some responsibility for their community.&nbsp; If not, we will only get what is left over or little &quot;gifts&quot; of nothing just so some developer can say &#39;Look what I gave you&quot;&nbsp; Last year, I went to Gantry Plaza to watch the fireworks only to find that unless I had a &quot;special pass&quot;&nbsp; (those living in City Lights had them)&nbsp; I was not allowed on the piers.&nbsp; &nbsp; So much for public access.&nbsp; <br />This is not a broken record.&nbsp; Grow up and take action!

				Hey goldfish boy, brooklyn just got a 80 acre waterfront park on the East River.<br /><br />Why don&#39;t you think Astorians deserve as much?<br /><br />Do you really want Vernon to be a bunch of garage entrances and high walls for the rich?<br /><br /><br />

				I understand that some folks in my building have been watching from our roof in recent years.&nbsp; I always seem to be visiting friends on the 4th and not in the neighborhood, but it sounds like fun and a way to meet other folks in your building (if you have roof access).

				Yes I am a former Roosevelt Islander, and yes I am biased, but the view really is great :)<br /><br />and there was a random Michael J. Fox movie a number of years ago where he played a hotel employee whose dream was to turn the smallpox hospital into a luxury hotel.

				(http://static.flickr.com/47/183785906_5225a0e3a8_m.jpg)<br />the view was perfect from Roosevelt Island, i think as far as having to pay for it-i was very happy with it. It was my first time on the island and i def want to go back for more exploring. And the walk to the 36th Street train wasn&#39;t too bad either, compared to waiting on the neverending line for the F train yuck!<br /><br />some more pics here<br />http://www.flickr.com/photos/98259649@N00/183785906/ (http://www.flickr.com/photos/98259649@N00/183785906/)<br />
