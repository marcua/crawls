			Hello residents of Astoria,<br /><br />I am happy to share as a newcomer to Astoria that I am teaching private and group guitar and music theory lessons in Astoria near 30 avenue. and Astoria Blvd train stops. <br />I&#039;ve had the privilege to receive my bachelors degree in Guitar performance from Berklee College of Music. I&#039;ve had the opportunity to perform a variety of music with great musicians which helped me develop my craft not only to play but to be able to teach others the skills I&#039;ve acquired. Because of my experience working with students of all ages from kids to adults, I truly believe that I can help anyone looking to accomplish their musical goals.<br /><br />Please feel free to call me about any questions you may have. My number is 305 607 8324.<br /><br />*Hablo Espanol<br /><br />Thank you and I look forward to working with you!<br /><br />Juan G.
