				Hi Dain Bramage,<br /><br />I am sorry you feel that way and I do love old farts. This is only the second event that I have held with the exception of the launch event of which all were welcomed.&nbsp; I am just starting up the business and this age group is my base- I know many people in this age range and know where to target them.&nbsp; When asked by more &quot;mature&quot; singles about doing events for their age groups I have asked where I can target these age groups- I cannot hold events if people don&#039;t show up.&nbsp; I would love to do events for those above the current demographic, however, no one seems to know where to target them.&nbsp; If you have any ideas I am open to hearing them.&nbsp; I am also only one person and I work a full-time job so it will take me time to build the business, get more acclimated with running a speed-dating company and building a reputation.&nbsp; As I continue I would definitely like to do events for the gay population in Astoria/LIC as well as for the more mature however it will take me some time.&nbsp; I am definitely not practicing ageism and will expand the events in due time.<br /><br />Thank you!<br />

				I guess you missed the smiley at the end there signifying that I wasn&#039;t entirely serious with my post.&nbsp; &nbsp; I hope my tongue-in-cheek criticism didn&#039;t upset you too badly.&nbsp; &nbsp;It was meant as a joke.&nbsp; &nbsp;I wish you great success in your business venture!

				I wasn&#039;t upset at all- but with these things you never can tell if people are serious or not, so I felt obligated to explain myself.&nbsp; Take care
