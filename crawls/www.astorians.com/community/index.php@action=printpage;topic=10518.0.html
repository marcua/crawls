				Hi all--<br /><br />Consider this an all points bulletin; I am seriously concerned.&nbsp; The gyro cart that sets up on the corner of 30th ave/31st street, right outside the seafood store/chase bank, hasn&#039;t been there for WEEKS (maybe I just haven&#039;t walked by at the right times?). <br /><br />I love love LOVE the gyros this guy makes.&nbsp; I know I am bordering on obsessive, but I think they&#039;re the best around, not to mention the fact that the guy who makes them is super nice!&nbsp; I wish i knew his name...the better to wander the streets of astoria shouting it.<br /><br />Does anyone know where this gyro cart has gone?&nbsp; Does it usually disappear around this time?&nbsp; I&#039;ve only lived here since the fall, so maybe I just don&#039;t know the schedule.&nbsp; Is my hero gone for good?&nbsp; Trapped in an elevator?&nbsp; Moved to riverdale?&nbsp; Found a better location on Steinway?&nbsp; Someone, please, help me out.<br /><br />love,<br />hungry a-riz<br /><br />PS: if anyone has suggestions for truly stellar gyros and souvlaki in the 30th ave area, please pass them on; i need to nurture my heart/stomach until i can be reunited with the cart on 30th/30st.<br />

				That corner is only a half block away from an Astorian institution. For almost 40 years one of the best gyros is made at this place. But, please, shhh, don&#039;t tell anyone. We here on the good side of Astoria want to keep them our secret from those authentic gyro-deprived folks nearer Ditmars! <br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">OPA Slouvaki</span> (http://www.opasouvlaki.com/)<br />2844 31st Street<br />Astoria, NY 11102<br />718-728-3638

				I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s the same cart, but a gyro cart is now parked on the corner of 30th St. &amp; 30th Ave.,<br />where they&#039;re nearly finished with the construction of that building that&#039;s been going on forever. The<br />sidewalk was just refinished and I&#039;ve noticed this cart there every night. He&#039;s right on the 30th St. <br />side, across from Tradefair&#039;s parking lot. He closes up shop in the early morning hours.

				thanks for the responses, guys. I&#039;ve been looking for that gyro cart near trade fair but haven&#039;t seen it!! my roommate claims to have spotted it only once in the last week, but can&#039;t confirm if it&#039;s MY gyro cart. when is it usually set up??<br /><br />Last night i went to Opa! for a chicken k bob sandwich...it was very tasty (thanks for the suggestion!), but i&#039;m still missing me some street meat.
