				People keep alluding to their collections of bad/funny date stories and I thought I&#039;d create a space for those stories to be told. <br /><br />One of my bad date stories: <br />I went out with a guy who seemed really jittery. I figured he was just a little timid about going on a date. We had lunch, went for a walk and had a talk about politics that I found rather annoying, and then nicely said goodbye. <br /><br />He called me a few days later to chat, and asked me if I had ever done drugs. I answered in the negative and then asked him. He started talking about all the drugs he had used, and not in a &quot;but that&#039;s over now&quot; sense but with a sense of pride. And then I realized why he was jittery! When he suggested we go out again, I found a gracious way to say &quot;thanks but no thanks.&quot; <br /><br />

				I would love to tell some of mine, but unfortunately, my profile&#039;s a little too public, and I&#039;d rather not rile up some disgruntled ex-date by writing up about him.&nbsp; But ask me in person sometime.&nbsp; I have a drug story very similar to yours!

				Hi folks!&nbsp; Of course it&#039;s a dating thread that gets me posting again - natch.&nbsp; My story isn&#039;t so much a bad date as a bad being dumped moment. Two or so days after Crapentine&#039;s Day (on which I received a very sweet card hinting at my former jerk&#039;s more-serious-than-he-let-on feelings for me) I get a phone call. &quot;We can&#039;t hang out on Friday. I&#039;m seeing someone else. I&#039;ve been in love with her for three years. She feels the same way and I only just found out; I have to see it through. I&#039;m sorry.&quot; So that sucked, particularly since I had just started getting Fridays and Saturdays off work (because my wacky schedule was a point of contention, you see).&nbsp; Then .....<br /><br />...a couple weeks later I got a text message saying that he misses me, thinks about me a lot, he&#039;s not happy with his new chick ... Like an idiot, I text back to say I was sorry to hear that. Then he CALLS me to whine about how she doesn&#039;t seem to want his attention (lets keep in mind that I had to fight like a Crusader for his attention), that they haven&#039;t spoken in a week, and wants to know what he should do about it. Should he try to call her and talk to her about it? What is he doing wrong? How can he fix it? He&#039;s asking me, the one he dumped not two weeks earlier like radioactive waste.&nbsp; Then he said he wanted to be friends with me, but he couldn&#039;t tell her because she knew about me and that we&#039;d been dating before they got together, so we&#039;d have to be &quot;secret friends.&quot;&nbsp; (Uh, yeah, that was his term. The guy is 39. Mature, right?) <br /><br />So I manage to pick up the fragments of my atom-bombed heart and get back out in scary Dating Land again, only to meet someone lovely, see him a few times, then get ignored for a week. So I call a couple times, send an email.&nbsp; Finally, I get a phone call back (not half an hour ago), and it&#039;s this: &quot;I think you&#039;re great, but there&#039;s something not quite right between us. I don&#039;t feel a connection ...&quot; Blah blah blah.&nbsp; Good grief. This is capping off one of the worst work weeks of my life. Not only that, the Biggest Brain application on Facebook says I have a brain the size of a cat&#039;s. So I&#039;m a high-functioning feline, and I&#039;ve eaten almost my weight in pasta for dinner, and now my stomach hurts. Payback, all of it, for pain I have caused folks in the past. I give up!!! <br /><br />(Hope you&#039;re all well; glad to be back.)

				This one is more funny than a horror story, but it certainly didn&#039;t earn him a second date. <br /><br />I was out at a club with a group, and dancing with this guy who was a friend of a friend. We were having a great time together, and we stopped for a break, and he bought me a drink. As we&#039;re chatting, out of nowhere he asks &quot;Are you Jewish?&quot;<br />I raised my eyebrows at that, but replied &quot;Why, because my name is Rachel?&quot; <br />And he says &quot;No because you have a big nos-,&quot; caught himself and replaced it with &quot;boobs&quot;<br /><br />I will be the first to tell you my chest is not at all large, but I didn&#039;t think my nose was that bad. It was worth it to see the look of horror in the guy&#039;s face after he realized what he said. He knew that he totally blew it.

				Unfortunately, all my dating horror stories are SO BAD that they are short story length, rather than just simple message board post length. I can sum one up in a few sentences. In college my long-distance boyfriend mailed me a package for Valentine&#039;s Day. I open it and it&#039;s a bunch of stuff that just doesn&#039;t really seem to be my thing. Nothing bad, just little knickknacks and such that left me scratching my head and wondering, &quot;Why&#039;d he get me THAT?&quot; The card was in the bottom of the box. And it was addressed to Carrie. My name is not Carrie. Turns out Carrie got the package meant for me. Needless to say, he got dumped TWICE that Valentine&#039;s Day.

				I scheduled a date with a man who had been actively pursuing me online.&nbsp; We knew a lot of the same people, but had never met, even though we ran in the same social circles.&nbsp; I had a community forum at which I had to make an appearance, but we agreed to meet up there and go a few blocks to a dinner to have our date.&nbsp; <br /><br />He arrived, seemed nice enough and I was looking forward to getting to know him - he certainly seemed intelligent and interesting.&nbsp; We talked as we walked to the dinner, then when we ordered, I noticed he only got coffee, which seemed odd, though some folks eat at weird hours. <br /><br />When he left 10 minutes later abruptly and didn&#039;t contact me again, I figured it was one of the oddest, though not the worst date I&#039;d ever had (maybe I&#039;ll post some of them soon).&nbsp; It&#039;s really weird as we run into each other maybe 10 times a year now - just an odd situation!

				I think my worst one was this guy I met online who a) lied about his height (he was about 3 inches shorter than me, which always makes me feel like an elephant), b) spent the entire meal talking about himself (I would have walked out, but it takes a lot for me to turn down a free dinner), including announcing with great pride, like I was supposed to be impressed, that he was a stand-in on Law and Order, c) insisted upon walking me home (I decided to just let him, because as I said before, I was significantly larger than him) and attempted to kiss me, and d) would not get the hint that I never wanted to see him again until several days later when he called for the umpteenth time and I told him, slowly and plainly, that I was not interested in pursuing a relationship or even a friendship.<br /><br />Beware short, skeevy narcissists!

				I have many stories that are simply too long to post here, but one of my shorter ones involves a blind date with a guy who I met for lunch. We agreed to meet at his office building and he kept me waiting in the lobby for 25 minutes. I called to say I was leaving, and he told me that his boss got him caught up in something, he&#039;d be right down. I said it was rude to keep me waiting so long without calling to either tell me he&#039;d be delayed or to reschedule, and he apologized. Another 10 minutes went by. I have no idea why I didn&#039;t just leave. He finally walked out of the elevator, and at that point I was really angry, and told him so. Then I said, &quot;Well anyway, what would you like to eat?&quot; He said, &quot;YOU.&quot; <br />Eeeeeeeewwwwww. I was so skeeved out. I turned around and walked away, while he called after me, &quot;What&#039;s wrong? Where are you going?&quot;. He actually tried calling after that! Obviously, I didn&#039;t return the call.

				I hate folks who lie about their height, or other physical characteristics for that matter.&nbsp; Do they really think you won&#039;t notice?<br /><br />I had a date with a guy who was 6 ft online.&nbsp; I&#039;m 5&#039;8&quot;, and just barely that, if I stand straight and don&#039;t slouch. I could clearly see over his head and had two to three inches, at a bare minimum on him.&nbsp; In what alternate universe is 5&#039;5&quot; 6 ft?&nbsp; That&#039;s just bizarre behavior.<br /><br />Keeping a blind date waiting is never courteous and a surefire way to not get a second date!

				Since there seems to be a large number of bad date stories where the guy is at fault, I thought I&#039;d tell you all a story about a terrible date I went on with this girl fairly attractive blond girl in her mid twenties.<br /><br />In reality it was all going pretty well except for the fact that she seemed pretty intensely interested which was a little creepy. She kept asking me about my living situation. Turns out it was because she was currently still living with her ex-boyfriend and was looking for a new one to move in with. <br /><br />Needless to say, once I found that out I quickly put an end to our date..............<br /><br />...........so I could take her home and sleep with her. <br /><br />And then ignored her phonecalls (she called for a _long_ time before taking the hint). <br /><br />Oh, right. I guess that&#039;s why guys don&#039;t tell their bad date stories. If the girl has a serious flaw in their personality or in some way we don&#039;t find them dateable, we&#039;ll still sleep with them. And then _we&#039;re_ the bad guys. Hmm...<br /><br /><br /><br />P.S. This was a couple years ago. I&#039;m a changed man now, I promise! *whistles innocently*

				Oh, I quite agree. Men are terrible. But women aren&#039;t exactly innocent either!<br /><br />A lot of them are clingy and manipulative - and those are their nice qualities.<br /><br />I think it boils down to finding someone who in general makes your life happier and whose garbage (there&#039;s always garbage) you can put up with. And then see if it works out. And when it inevitably doesn&#039;t you get out there and try again. Until you die.<br /><br />Aren&#039;t relationships grand?

				Drakr...<br /><br />That&#039;s life.&nbsp; You go to a car dealership and buy a car that looks and runs great but then a few months down the road it starts giving you trouble, here you thought you bought a car that was going to last you a few years.<br /><br />Well it&#039;s like that with people too, the difference is that when we chose someone we&#039;re thinking very long term and it&#039;s a person not an object but just like the car sometimes it doesn&#039;t work that way.<br /><br />It takes time, usually at first persons are too shy or simply don&#039;t trust to just simply let it all out and start allowing someone in but with time two people get to know each other more and the trust level grows and then you start seeing the flaws.&nbsp; The problem is how it&#039;s handled later on, some people choose to see if they can deal with the flaws, some people think they can change the person (Wrong thing to do by the way) and others just get out quick.<br /><br />As far as comments that men are this way and women are that way to me that has always been a bit prejudice.&nbsp; It&#039;s the same as saying that all Hispanics are this way or all Greeks are that way, all Hebrews are like this.&nbsp; It&#039;s just not right.&nbsp; There are bad apples, period, and sometimes we pick a bad apple....<br /><br />...oh well, that&#039;s how it goes but the good thing about this is that with each bad apple we learn a little more, we learn what we don&#039;t like and we even learn about ourselve a bit (what&#039;s our tolerance level, what is it that we thought we could put up with and can&#039;t) so it&#039;s really just a journey.<br /><br />It&#039;s up to you on how you want to make that journey...&nbsp; It can be a lot of fun if you also look at the good times and not just the bad.<br /><br />Oh..the hello stranger was for justdesserts, she&#039;s an old timer and she hasn&#039;t been on&nbsp; here for a long time.<br /><br />

				Ok, and we now return you to your regularly scheduled bad date stories! <br /><br />I bet hearing some bad date stories after the singles mixer tomorrow would be terribly great fun, but I think that would be in exceedingly poor taste to do.

				&quot;...a couple weeks later I got a text message saying that he misses me&quot;<br /><br />Isn&#039;t it amazing how they always come back?<br /><br />All I know is this...when you finally give up, throw your hands up in the air and say FORGET IT and reach the conclusion that your lifetime companion is going to be your cat and that you&#039;re not going to put your heart out on the line for anyone again because after so many bad dates and relationships you realize there&#039;s no one out there......<br /><br />That&#039;s when it happens, I met the best man in the world that I think &quot;How the hell did I survive all these years without him?&quot; and he was in the same mode as me...had given up.<br /><br />Horror dates?&nbsp; I can write a book.<br />Horror relationships?&nbsp; I can write another book.<br /><br />I think we all can!!
