				Putting in a &quot;Mediterranean Food&quot; store under the tracks across from the Astoria Tavern on 23d Ave. Formerly the tile place that has been remodeled. Been working on it for several months. Just saw the sign this AM.

				Sounds like it&#039;s across from Sal, Kris &amp; Charlie&#039;s.&nbsp; Or right around there anyway.<br /><br /><br />I wonder if it&#039;s related to the other &quot;Mediterranean Foods&quot; stores.&nbsp; Maybe a third location?<br /><br /><br />http://www.mediterraneanfoodsny.com/aboutus.html

				Well, it&#039;s a LOT further along than that last article would indicate. Scaffolding is down, interior looked like it was nearly finished. Windows are up and facade is done. And yes it is across from both Sal, Chris &amp; Charlies and the Astoria Tavern. No parking for the space, though- but you wouldn&#039;t want to park under the viaduct anyway. The cars that used to park by the prints place would be Guano covered in a short time.

				Yes RayG-pigeon poop was the first thing I thought about last weekend when I saw the Mediterranean Food store under construction. No room for a parking lot on the grounds? There&#039;s definitely no room for additional parking on the street, and customers might track the poop into the store-yuck. As much as I can&#039;t stand pigeons I shudder to think what actions might be taken to solve the problem.

				There really isn&#039;t any ROOM for parking spaces. If there is, maybe 2 cars before they impede on the sidewalk. I haven&#039;t noticed any curb cutting, which would indicate putting in a small lot.

				Update on this space: The Mediterranean Foods is now open. They cut the curb to allow for a parking lot and have posted signs saying parking plus for customers only.

				Johnny4evah / RayG ~ hello.. <br /><br /><br />Pigeons get a bad rap.&nbsp; I actually feel bad for all of them, especially when I have seen their mate (they are monogamous) a few times standing by as if they were to miraculously come back to life after being ran over by a car.&nbsp; We, have closed in on their habitats.&nbsp; We, have caused the environmental changes and, these feathered creatures are only trying to survive as best they can without being crushed, poisoned or having to re-build their new homes only for it to be forced down by us. <br /><br /><br />Did you know they are very intelligent?&nbsp; Did you know their navigational skills are outstanding?
