				<strong>Here Are The Rules for the Karaoke Contest and Everything You Need to Know... I Wish Everyone the Best <br />of Luck! Barry and I decided to change some of the rules and here they are... </strong><br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>I just want to reassure the people that don't want to be a part of this contest but still want to sing <br />karaoke each week still can as the contest will only interrupt part of the night. So please join us each week.<br />&nbsp;</strong><br /><span style="font-size: 18px;" class="bbc_size"><span class="bbc_u"><em><strong>PLEASE READ EVERYTHING!!!</strong></em></span></span><br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Doyle's Corner </strong>along with <strong>Starlite Karaoke </strong>http://www.starlitekaraoke.com is going to have a <br /><strong>KARAOKE CONTEST &nbsp;</strong>with the <strong>biggest cash prize offered at $3000.00 CASH </strong>to the winner of the contest!!! <strong>Yes, that's right the winner of the contest will get <br />$3000.00 in Cold Hard Cash! </strong>There will also be a cash prize for second &amp; third place (TBA.)<strong> The contest will start on Saturday, <br />October 8 at Doyles Corner, (Corner of 42 Street &amp; Broadway in Astoria &nbsp;(718) 278-9402) starting time will be <br />11 PM. </strong><strong>The contest will run for 20 weeks each Saturday Night with the final contest for the big cash prize being held on Saturday, &nbsp;March 11 </strong>(<span class="bbc_u"><em><strong>Note* There will be no contest for Christmas Eve December 24 and New Year's Eve December 31) </strong></em></span>The Contest will start each week at 11 PM but get there earlier to register. Each week we will sign up 10 contestants who will have to <strong>pay a $10.00 entry fee</strong>; which will provide us with $2000.00 over the 20 weeks for the needed $3000.00 grand prize, Doyles Corner will sponsor $2000.00 giving us an extra $1000.00 for second &amp; third place winners. If there is a big response to this contest and we can sign up more then 10 people each week we will do so, with the extra money collected going directly to a second, third and maybe even a fourth place prize. Each week we will have one winner who will be in the finals. If you enter one week and don't win you can enter again the following week by paying another $10.00. The contest will be judged by Doyles Corner's Two Bartender's Barry and Brendan along with 2 guest judges that will decide the outcome each week. &nbsp;On the night of the finals there will be 4 guest judges along with Barry and Brendan deciding who the winner's will be. This will all be done with a rating system. The Judges will give you 1 to 10 stars for four different categories. The first category will be on your singing ability. The<br />second category will be on your song choice. The third category will be placed on your originality and the fourth category will be on your showmanship and stage presence. The person with the most Star's win's. All the singer's will draw number's to see which place you will sing in. So in a nut shell you show up to any of the Saturday's during the contest sign up by paying 10 bucks and win that night and your in the finals for all the cash, if you don't win you can show up any of the other week's during the contest pay another 10 buck's and try again. You must be there the night of the finals to win any cash. No Exceptions! So if you know you can't make it the night of the final's don't enter the contest. &nbsp;Each contestant is encouraged to have their own music but it is not mandatory. Again Good Luck to everyone that join's...Hope to see all of you at our own little Astoria Idol Contest... If you need any questions answered please e-mail me, Richard at starlite1karaoke@aol.com <br />&nbsp;<br />Paul B if you are reading this and want to shoot the finals for The Public Access Channel, just e-mail me, as this will make for great television!!!
