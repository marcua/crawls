				For those that walk down 23rd avenue and under the bridge between 32nd and 33rd street, it can be quite a foul experience.&nbsp; Bird crap is everywhere.&nbsp; On the ground, covering vehicles parked beneath it (and for some unfortunate souls, it may be on YOU).&nbsp; During and after rainfall the smell under the bridge is putrid.&nbsp; Is there any way to address a council of some sort and petition to affix netting to the bridge rafters?&nbsp; I&#39;m not familiar with how to approach the city with local matters like this, but I&#39;d like to do something.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				OMG, it is scary walking under there sometimes.&nbsp; Lately, I been wondering if Tippi Hedron has been near, there have been so many birds!&nbsp; Esp. in the morning, the sound of all those birds is almost deafening.&nbsp; I fear getting plopped on, so I walk under quickly.&nbsp; I, too, wonder how the City could intervene with some sort of protective barrier between the bridge and the ground.

				Hm, well, the Tammany Democratic Association is right there under the bridge, so maybe the old machine knows who to talk to to deal with that?<br />

				But then the protective barrier becomes a breeding ground for disease.&nbsp; At least when it hits the ground (or, occasionally, my head) it gets washed away.<br /><br />And when a dead pigeon lands in the barrier, it will sit up there and rot.&nbsp; How many at one time will collect, sitting up there rotting in a stew of poo?&nbsp; &nbsp;:|<br /><br />There&#39;s got to be a better way.

				The way I was thinking, the netting would be placed on the rafters as a means for keeping birds from roosting there altogether.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#39;ve seen buildings using netting for this purpose, and it seems to work.&nbsp; If you meant putting a tarp under the rafters to catch the bird crap (and possibly pigeon corpses), then yes I agree with you, bad idea!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
