I didn&#039;t&nbsp; say&nbsp; it was&nbsp; ALL Carters&nbsp; and Clintons&nbsp; &#039;fault&#039;, but, things&nbsp; didn&#039;t&nbsp; just suddenly happen&nbsp; when Bush became President. Bush is supporting the only man&nbsp; who was trying&nbsp; to&nbsp; stop the islamicists&nbsp; from taking over when Pakistan&nbsp; has nukes. He&nbsp; is already&nbsp; &nbsp;going to have to elections, which is more&nbsp; than&nbsp; Chinathe Former&nbsp; Soviet&nbsp; Union, Cuba or any of the workers&nbsp; &#039;paradise&#039; places&nbsp; that have been supported&nbsp; at every so-called&nbsp; &#039;Peace&#039; rally&nbsp; since&nbsp; I&#039;ve been alive. There is&nbsp; no &#039;Peace&#039; movement, it&#039;s&nbsp; a pro-war&nbsp; movement&nbsp; &nbsp;proping up dictatorships&nbsp; for&nbsp; decades. So, let&#039;s&nbsp; get that myth of a&nbsp; &#039;peace&#039; movement out of the way.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So because a few imbeciles wear Che t-shirts (which are made, just like every other t-shirt, by capitalists looking to make a buck), you lump everyone who is not on your side along with them.&nbsp; I guess I was right about your arithmetic.<br /><br />And let me get this straight about Pakistan...you&#039;re okay with Bush supporting a dictator, because according to you, he&#039;s the only man that would stop the &quot;Islamofascists&quot; from getting their hands on that country&#039;s nukes.&nbsp; But, it&#039;s okay for us to go to Iraq, which did not have nukes or WMD&#039;s as it turns out, take away their dictator because he wasn&#039;t playing ball with us, only to destabilize the country and create a strong risk that those same Islamofascists might set up their own regime there someday, while in the meantime, those &quot;Islamofascists&quot; also are having a field day fueling anti-American sentiment among the people because of our actions.<br /><br />Musharraf is going to have &quot;elections&quot; only after he conveniently purged the Supreme Court of any justices that were against him.&nbsp; Would you be surprised if he and those he is backing &quot;win&quot; those elections, just like Putin &quot;won&quot; the recent elections in Russia?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I explained&nbsp; why Bush&nbsp; took out Iraq, and you gave me&nbsp; a list of useless&nbsp; internet faux information. BTW, His&nbsp; &#039;Daddy&#039; happened&nbsp; to be the President&nbsp; of the USA. But, all this doesn&#039;t matter, the mantra&nbsp; of Haliburton,&nbsp; a company used for decades&nbsp; supporting the troops, as some sinster&nbsp; corpration that just suddenly appeared run by Cheney&nbsp; is ridiculous and wrong.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Those no-bid contracts Halliburton has received sure don&#039;t sound very democratic to me.&nbsp; Nor is the fact that Pres, err, Vice-President Cheney, who lo and behold was a former Halliburton exec, is profiting quite handsomely from the deal.&nbsp; Did you know that prior to Bush winning the election, Halliburton was the 37th largest Department of Defense contractor?&nbsp; Now they are #1.&nbsp; Did you know that one of the founders of Halliburton was Bush&#039;s grandpa, former Senator Prescott Bush?&nbsp; You&#039;re right.&nbsp; Halliburton didn&#039;t just suddenly appear.&nbsp; They&#039;ve been around for quite a while.&nbsp; But the current administration has certainly gone a long way in transforming them from just one of many contractors that does business with the government, into *the* preferred choice of the White House and the Pentagon.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I don&#039;t know&nbsp; how many &#039;corrupt&#039; officials&nbsp; have left, but, they have left. Yes, the constant baseless accusations by the Left and attacks using the Press is very Soviet, thanks for pointing it out. I mean you are bound to get&nbsp; someone if you keep accusing.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Wow, I didn&#039;t know that all the corrupt officials are all gone.&nbsp; I bet you counted them yourself and everything.&nbsp; You are bound to get someone if you keep accusing?&nbsp; Sounds a lot like the current administration&#039;s policy on the enemy combatants, if you ask me.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Diminishing separation of Church and State?&nbsp; You mean the state diminishing the Church, only if it&#039;s&nbsp; &#039;Christian.&#039; Anything else&nbsp; is AOK, it&#039;s&nbsp; &#039;diversity&#039; and if you complain you will be branded&nbsp; a fascist and a racist.&nbsp; The Press&nbsp; has become&nbsp; very Soviet, no doubt about it.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Your one-track, &quot;you&#039;re with us or against us&quot; mantra, shared by the Bush administration, is far more Soviet than anything I&#039;ve seen in the press, which happens to be largely controlled by corporations such as News Corp. and GE that are anything but &quot;Soviet.&quot;<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The Press in the so-called&nbsp; &#039;Free&#039; West is&nbsp; a horror. It&#039;s run by so-called &#039;idependent&#039; Journalists&nbsp; from cookie-cutter leftist&nbsp; indoctrinated&nbsp; Univerisities. The few that slip through are denounced&nbsp; as Fascists and Warmongers, like FOX&nbsp; news, which is hardly&nbsp; &#039;right-wing.&#039; You can deny and throw out as many accusations as you want, but, there are tens of millions&nbsp; like me seething below&nbsp; the surface&nbsp; at the control of our&nbsp; culture and destruction of our&nbsp; traditions by a&nbsp; relatively small &#039;mob&#039; in the Northeastern states&nbsp; and LA. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />LOL.&nbsp; Again, News Corp. and GE, or Disney hardly qualify as &quot;soviet.&quot;&nbsp; Neither do Time Warner or Disney or Viacom or Clear Channel or any of the other huge corporations which control the largest media institutions in this country and the world.&nbsp; But perhaps such an aversion to &quot;cookie-cutter leftist indoctrinated Universities&quot; is why over a hundred White House lawyers all went to the same law school, Liberty University (owned by Pat Robertson).&nbsp; Hardly cookie-cutter nor leftist, I&#039;ll give you that.<br /><br />Except, there&#039;s a problem.&nbsp; Bush went to one of those cookie-cutter, leftist universities.&nbsp; Two, in fact.&nbsp; Harvard and Yale (certainly through only his own academic merits, with no help whatsoever from father and grandpa Bush&nbsp; :lol:).&nbsp; Seems to me that throws a monkey wrench into your equation.<br /><br /></div>

Talk about a recipe&nbsp; for endless&nbsp; war?&nbsp; Truth is Saddam was allied&nbsp; with himself, his armed&nbsp; forces&nbsp; had virtually no US arms, Saddams&nbsp; planes, tanks and&nbsp; weapons&nbsp; were mostly made in China, Soviet&nbsp; Union, and&nbsp; the only &#039;support&#039; he&nbsp; received&nbsp; from us was&nbsp; as&nbsp; a&nbsp; bulwark&nbsp; against&nbsp; Iran which had just held&nbsp; hostages&nbsp; in Iran and supported the terror&nbsp; groups&nbsp; worldwide&nbsp; against&nbsp; the USA. We can thank that&nbsp; great&nbsp; &#039;pacifist&#039; President&nbsp; Carter&nbsp; for that&nbsp; fiasco.&nbsp; Saudi&nbsp; Arabia, a country&nbsp; I know a little&nbsp; something about, since&nbsp; I&nbsp; was&nbsp; in ROTC&nbsp; program with the son of one&nbsp; of the board&nbsp; members&nbsp; of ARAMCO in the early&nbsp; 80&#039;s, is the center of&nbsp; Islamic&nbsp; faith. You really want to start&nbsp; a&nbsp; &#039;religious&#039; global war between Islam and&nbsp; Christianity, try starting a war&nbsp; in Mecca, Islam&#039;s holiest&nbsp; site. It&#039;s not just&nbsp; a&nbsp; matter&nbsp; of &#039;cozy.&#039; </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Of course.&nbsp; He didn&#039;t have many weapons that were made by the USA anymore, such as the chemical and biological weapons we sold him, because he used those all on the Kurds years ago!&nbsp; Of course, at the time, we did nary a thing to stop him.&nbsp; He was an ally then.<br /><br />As for thanking President Carter for that fiasco, what business did Rumsfeld have in Baghdad in 1984 then, in that well-documented photo shaking Saddam&#039;s hand?&nbsp; Perhaps he was just delivering him a birthday card.&nbsp; That must be it.</div>

They make billions&nbsp; in Hollywood&nbsp; really doing nothing, glorified&nbsp; court jesters who at one time&nbsp; did at least&nbsp; care about the nation they live in and didn&#039;t&nbsp; fly around the world&nbsp; hugging it&#039;s enemies. Let&#039;s&nbsp; not go further on the arts&nbsp; and media&nbsp; class because&nbsp; they house&nbsp; some of the worst&nbsp; beings on this planet. A lot of crazed&nbsp; dictators came from being poor, it&#039;s&nbsp; not a&nbsp; virtue, it&#039;s a circumstance.

C&#039;mon, let&#039;s&nbsp; face it, we live&nbsp; on a planet&nbsp; where&nbsp; 3/4&nbsp; of the beings&nbsp; barely walk erect&nbsp; and&nbsp; the rest of them are the squabbling classes&nbsp; who think they can fix&nbsp; it by denouncing&nbsp; the other&nbsp; guy. The Euros&nbsp; are finally&nbsp; &#039;paying back&#039;&nbsp; the USA&nbsp; for being a&nbsp; Sap for&nbsp; 50 years and they are&nbsp; beating us up economically and they&nbsp; supported&nbsp; the Dictator&nbsp; we tried&nbsp; to overthrow to keep getting his Oil. Lets&#039;&nbsp; not forget our &#039;allies&#039;&nbsp; who&nbsp; after 9/11&nbsp; shed&nbsp; a&nbsp; tear while applauding and cheering that&nbsp; Uncle Sap&nbsp; was finally knocked from his pearch, now it&#039;s their&nbsp; turn, but, the Islamicists&nbsp; are going to give&nbsp; them a run for&nbsp; their money, lives and whats&nbsp; left of Euro-Tradition. But, it&#039;s&nbsp; all Bush&#039;s fault, if he only&nbsp; left Saddam alone, went into Afghan so Saddam and others&nbsp; could be freed up to support groups&nbsp; there, we would&nbsp; be in Afghan with a Strong Saddam and neither Khadafy or that imp in Iran would have stopped&nbsp; anything.&nbsp; </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />LOL again.&nbsp; You&#039;re just digging yourself into a bigger and bigger hole.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Still, there&nbsp; is hope.

Musharaf&nbsp; was fighting the Isalmicists&nbsp; and even those who now talk of having elections&nbsp; know the danger. It wasn&#039;t Bush&#039;s&nbsp; choice. Second Musharaff is having election. Now, when will Robert Redford and Sean Penn ask Castro&nbsp; to step&nbsp; down?&nbsp; Iraq&nbsp; was in a&nbsp; war, and was saying it had WMD&#039;s and&nbsp; Saddam was already destabilising the region and we were on our way to Afghan. He was going sanctionless, an dwe didn;t know&nbsp; if he was bluffing or&nbsp; not, now we&nbsp; don&#039;t have to worry about Saddam ever again. BTW, virtually ALL of Saddam&#039;s&nbsp; weapons were from China, the Former&nbsp; Soviets and even the so-called &#039;chems&#039; he got from &#039;us&#039; were&nbsp; supplied&nbsp; by the &quot;Peace Coalition&#039;, France&nbsp; andGermany. <br /><br />Musharraf is going to have &quot;elections&quot; only after he conveniently purged the Supreme Court of any justices that were against him.&nbsp; Would you be surprised if he and those he is backing &quot;win&quot; those elections, just like Putin &quot;won&quot; the recent elections in Russia?<br /><br />Wel, it&#039;s&nbsp; better&nbsp; than Cuba and Venezuela where&nbsp; I&#039;m told its&nbsp; a paradise&nbsp; by the &#039;Peace&#039; demonstrators. <br /><br />Those no-bid contracts Halliburton has received sure don&#039;t sound very democratic to me.&nbsp; Nor is the fact that Pres, err, Vice-President Cheney, who lo and behold was a former Halliburton exec, is profiting quite handsomely from the deal.&nbsp; Did you know that prior to Bush winning the election, Halliburton was the 37th largest Department of Defense contractor?&nbsp; Now they are #1.&nbsp; Did you know that one of the founders of Halliburton was Bush&#039;s grandpa, former Senator Prescott Bush?&nbsp; You&#039;re right.&nbsp; Halliburton didn&#039;t just suddenly appear.&nbsp; They&#039;ve been around for quite a while.&nbsp; But the current administration has certainly gone a long way in transforming them from just one of many contractors that does business with the government, into *the* preferred choice of the White House and the Pentagon.<br /><br />Yeah, and he was&nbsp; also a Nazi, did you know it? FactCheck is&nbsp; an organization which ascertains the validity of political campaign advertisements researched this accusation. According to FactCheck , &quot;The Bush administration is doing a fair amount to fight corporate corruption, convicting or indicting executives of Enron, Arthur Andersen, Tyco International, Worldcom, Adelphia Communications Corporation, Credit Suisse First Boston, HealthSouth Corporation and others, including Martha Stewart. The Department of Justice says it has brought charges against 20 executives of Enron alone, and its Corporate Fraud Task Force says it has won convictions of more than 250 persons to date. Bush also signed the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation in 2002, imposing stringent new accounting rules in the wake of the Arthur Andersen scandal.&quot;<br /><br />When Factcheck.org checked the facts about allegations by Democrats that there was a scandal because of the &quot;no-bid&quot; contracts awarded to Halliburton they stated, &quot;It is false to imply that Bush personally awarded a contract to Halliburton. The ‘no-bid contract’ in question is actually an extension of an earlier contract to support U.S. troops overseas that Halliburton won under open bidding. In fact, the notion that Halliburton benefited from any cronyism has been poo-poohed by a Harvard University professor, Steven Kelman, who was administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy in the Clinton administration. ‘One would be hard-pressed to discover anyone with a working knowledge of how federal contracts are awarded...who doesn&#039;t regard these allegations as being somewhere between highly improbable and utterly absurd,’ Kelman wrote in the Washington Post last November.&quot; <br /><br />The Center for Public Integrity another public interest group also investigated the purported scandal of the Halliburton &quot;no-bid&quot; contracts. They wrote:<br /><br />In Iraq, Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg Brown &amp; Root (KBR) has been awarded five contracts worth at least $10.8 billion, including more than $5.6 billion under the U.S. Army&#039;s Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP) contract, an omnibus contract that allows the Army to call on KBR for support in all of its field operations. When the Army needs a service performed, it issues a &quot;task order,&quot; which lays out specific work requirements under the contract…From 1992 to 1997, KBR held the first LOGCAP contract awarded by the Army, but when it was time to renew the contract, the company lost in the competitive bidding process to DynCorp after the General Accounting Office reported in February 1997 that KBR had overrun its estimated costs in the Balkans by 32 percent (some of which was attributed to an increase in the Army&#039;s demands). KBR (obtained) the third LOGCAP contract in December 2001…<em>n November 2002 the Army Corps of Engineers tasked KBR to develop a contingency plan for extinguishing oil well fires in Iraq…<ul class="bbc_list"><li type="circle">n March 24, 2003, the Army Corps announced publicly that KBR had been awarded a contract to restore oil-infrastructure in Iraq, potentially worth $7 billion. The contract KBR received…would eventually include 10 distinct task orders. KBR did not come close to reaching the contract ceiling, billing just over $2.5 billion…The contract was awarded without submission for public bids or congressional notification. In their response to congressional inquiries, Army officials said they determined that extinguishing oil fires fell under the range of services provided under LOGCAP, meaning that KBR could deploy quickly and without additional security clearances.</li></ul><br /><br />Neither the Center for Public Integrity nor Factcheck.org determined anything sinister about Halliburton’s no-bid&quot; contracts for the Iraq war. Two nonpartisan, nonaligned, public interest organizations have investigated the Halliburton allegations and found them to be specious allegations made for purely political purposes.<br /><br />An L.A. Times op-ed of April 22 said, &quot;Halliburton Received No-Bid Contracts During Clinton Administration For Work In Bosnia And Kosovo.&quot; An October 2003 article in the (Raleigh, NC) News &amp; Observer quoted Bill Clinton&#039;s Undersecretary Of Commerce William Reinsch as saying &quot;&#039;Halliburton has a distinguished track record,&#039; he said. &#039;They do business in some 120 countries. This is a group of people who know what they&#039;re doing in a difficult business. It&#039;s a particularly difficult business when people are shooting at you.&#039;&quot;<br /><br />If Democrats want to investigate a scandal involving Iraq they should devote their efforts to the UN &quot;Oil-for-Food&quot; program instead of Halliburton. <br /><br />Wow, I didn&#039;t know that all the corrupt officials are all gone.&nbsp; I bet you counted them yourself and everything.&nbsp; You are bound to get someone if you keep accusing?&nbsp; Sounds a lot like the current administration&#039;s policy on the enemy combatants, if you ask me.<br /><br />There&nbsp; is no enemy, except Bush and Cheney, right? <br /><br />Your one-track, &quot;you&#039;re with us or against us&quot; mantra, shared by the Bush administration, is far more Soviet than anything I&#039;ve seen in the press, which happens to be largely controlled by corporations such as News Corp. and GE that are anything but &quot;Soviet.&quot;<br /><br />LOL.&nbsp; Again, News Corp. and GE, or Disney hardly qualify as &quot;soviet.&quot;&nbsp; Neither do Time Warner or Disney or Viacom or Clear Channel or any of the other huge corporations which control the largest media institutions in this country and the world.&nbsp; But perhaps such an aversion to &quot;cookie-cutter leftist indoctrinated Universities&quot; is why over a hundred White House lawyers all went to the same law school, Liberty University (owned by Pat Robertson).&nbsp; Hardly cookie-cutter nor leftist, I&#039;ll give you that.<br /><br />Except, there&#039;s a problem.&nbsp; Bush went to one of those cookie-cutter, leftist universities.&nbsp; Two, in fact.&nbsp; Harvard and Yale (certainly through only his own academic merits, with no help whatsoever from father and grandpa Bush&nbsp; :lol:).&nbsp; Seems to me that throws a monkey wrench into your equation.<br /><br /><br />Even in the Soviet Union, people&nbsp; slipped&nbsp; through indoctrination. </em></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></div>

But, I do like how you sidestepped&nbsp; Jimmy Carter, that man did more damage&nbsp; to this&nbsp; country in four&nbsp; years&nbsp; than the last ten Presidents&nbsp; combined. <br /><br />BTW, You are&nbsp; incorrect about the bio and chem weapons, that Saddam never&nbsp; had, but, claims he did up until we enforced&nbsp; the ceasefire&nbsp; you claim&nbsp; there was&nbsp; never a war we went with him in 1991, which also never happened. <br />Paris, Moscow, Berlin, Brussels and Beijing the &#039;Peace Coalition&#039; all threatened to veto any U.N. move for the United States to war with Iraq. All of these members had vowed to strike a blow for &#039;peace&#039; and not challenge Saddam Hussein. However, Saddam had more than just diplomacy to thank our global allies for.<br /><br />Saddam was not one to settle for second best. Saddam had to arm his nation with the best military equipment the world could offer. Saddam&#039;s quest to arm his country led him on a shopping spree in Paris, Moscow, Berlin, Brussels and Beijing.<br /><br />Iraq&#039;s best jet fighter was purchased from France. The Mirage F-1 is considered to be a state of the art strike-fighter capable of launching advanced missiles. France has sold over 700 Mirage F-1 fighters to over 11 nations. Iraq had&nbsp; &nbsp;60 F-1 fighters in its air force inventory.<br /><br />The F-1 is capable of flying over twice the speed of sound and is normally armed with air-to-air missiles and twin 30 mm cannons. However, the F-1 also has a deadly strike capability. <br /><br />A Mirage F-1 was used by Iraq to launch two Exocet anti-ship missiles that struck the USS Stark before the Gulf War, killing over 40 American sailors.<br /><br />During the Gulf War, France sent a squadron of advanced Mirage fighters to assist the allied forces. However, the French fighter jets were effectively removed from the fighting area because their radar emissions matched the Iraqi F-1 jets. <br /><br />The allied air commanders quarantined the French jets, not allowing them to fly combat missions over Iraq, because they feared the Mirage fighters would be mistaken as Iraqi and be shot down.<br /><br />Iraq attempted to strike Saudi Arabia using two of its F-1 fighters during the Gulf War. The F-1s carried modified Exocet cruise missiles intended to strike at Saudi cities. Instead, the F-1 fighters were jumped by a Saudi Air Force F-15 Eagle and shot down, the only double kill during the entire war.<br /><br />The F-1 also appeared recently in a short video shown by U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell to the United Nations. The Iraqi F-1 is shown testing a biological/chemical spraying system at low altitude. The F-1 video is a telling example of Iraq&#039;s illegal biological and chemical weapons program.<br /><br />The effort and money expended to develop and test a spraying system for installation on a Mach 2 jet fighter is not something done on sheer whim. The difficulty and expense of modifying the top Iraqi jet fighter to carry biological and chemical weapons indicates a certain willingness to use these weapons. It also demonstrates the desire to acquire such weapon systems despite any U.N. ban.<br /><br />Saddam purchased a large number of French-made Aerospatiale and Eurocopter helicopters for his army. Both the Aerospatiale and Eurocopter systems can deploy chemical weapons. <br /><br />The Iraqi army is also well-equipped with what is considered to be the best artillery weapon in the world, the French-made 155 mm howitzer. The Iraqi army used its 155 mm guns during its war with Iran to fire chemical weapons as well as a large array of conventional munitions. <br /><br /><br /><br />The biggest weapons supplier to Iraq was Russia. Iraq reportedly still owes Russia over $4 billion for arms purchases in the past 20 years. Obviously, if Saddam Hussein was removed from power, Russia was not likely to be paid for the past weapons sales. <br /><br />The vast majority of Iraq&#039;s air force consists of Russian-made jet fighters. Iraq had nearly 200 Russian-made jet fighters including MiG-21, MiG-23, MiG-25, Sukhoi SU-22 and Sukhoi SU-25 interceptors.<br /><br />The Iraqi army is equipped with hundreds of Russian artillery pieces, rocket launchers, BMP armored vehicles, T-55 and T-72 tanks and Scud missiles. Most of Iraq&#039;s chemical arsenal, estimated at around 200 tons of nerve gas and mustard gas, is fired from Russian-made weapons.<br /><br />For example, Iraq recently modified a MiG-21 jet fighter to act as a radio-controlled chemical sprayer. In addition, most of Iraq&#039;s air-delivered chemical weapons deployed in its long war with Iran came from the belly of MiG-21 and MiG-23 fighter jets. <br /><br />Most of the estimated 100 tons of nerve gas that remained in Saddam&#039;s arsenal is thought to be stored in Russia-made bombs designed for the MiG fighters.<br /><br />In addition, U.N. inspectors recently discovered empty rocket warheads designed to deploy nerve gas. The rocket warheads in question are part of a Russian missile system sold to Iraq.<br /><br />The telltale sign that Al-Musayyib as a chemical weapons facility was the presence of Russian-made chemical decontamination vehicles that arrived to assist technicians dressed in Hazmat suits. It is only logical to conclude that the Iraqis were concerned for their safety, because one does not put on a Hazmat suit in the desert for the fun of it.<br /><br />Saddam turned to Europe and China in order to construct his chemical weapons production facilities. German and Chinese chemical manufacturing equipment has been purchased over the years and embedded into the Iraqi commercial infrastructure. The intent was to make these facilities as civilian-looking as possible.<br /><br />Israeli citizens discovered during the Gulf War that German-made electronics systems were found inside Scud missiles fired at Tel Aviv. <br /><br />The German electronics allowed Iraq to modify the Scud missiles, making them more accurate, cheaper to produce and much more deadly. <br /><br />Israel found that German-made electronics were the heart of the Iraqi Scud warhead fusing mechanism. The very same fusing mechanism was employed effectively by Iraq when a Scud fell on the U.S. Army barracks outside Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, killing 28 American soldiers and wounding over 100 others.<br /><br />Saddam turned to Belgium before the Gulf War in an attempt to improve his Scud missiles and to create a weapon never seen before in any military arsenal. Iraq contracted Canadian Dr. Gerald Bull to build a super-gun, using components manufactured in the U.K., Belgium, Germany and Italy. Dr. Bull&#039;s base of operations was Brussels, Belgium.<br /><br />Belgian officials ignored repeated warnings from Iranian and Israeli intelligence officials that Dr. Bull was developing such a weapon for Saddam Hussein. Dr. Bull also assisted Iraq by improving the accuracy and range of its existing arsenal of Scud missiles.<br /><br />Bull used weak Belgian export regulations to circumvent export bans against assisting Saddam&#039;s quest for super-weapons, trans-shipping much of the equipment for his super-gun and Scud projects through Brussels. <br /><br />In the end, Bull paid for his assistance with his life. An unknown assailant assassinated him outside his Brussels apartment.<br /><br />Saddam also turned to China in order to purchase the very finest in weapon systems. Iraq purchased a number of Chengdu F-7 fighter jets from Beijing and has managed to trans-ship spare parts made in China for its force of F-7 and MiG-21 fighters through illegal front companies in Jordan, Hong Kong and Singapore.<br /><br />China also supplied Iraq with a large number of T-55 and T-58 tanks equipped with modern night-vision gun sights and laser range-finding systems. Somehow, the Iraqis keep these tanks in tip-top condition with an ample supply of Chinese-made spare parts.<br /><br />It is well known that China sold Iraq the &quot;Tiger Song&quot; air defense system during the 1990s. Both Colin Powell and Condi Rice have stated that China sold Iraq its new air defense system. <br /><br />The sale took place despite the fact that China also signed on to the U.N. ban on weapons sales to Iraq. NATO gave the system its name in 1998 after it was discovered to be operational in the Iraqi desert.<br /><br />In 1994, German authorities seized a large shipload of ammonium perchlorate bound for Iraq. The Chinese Chemical Import-Export Corporation, a subsidiary of the People&#039;s Liberation Army, stated the chemical was bound for Baghdad as a food preservative. Anyone with half a brain knows that ammonium perchlorate is a lousy preservative but a key component in solid rocket fuel.<br /><br />In 2001, the Chinese Shangdong Arts and Craft Company went to Baghdad in an effort to open trade ties between Iraq and China. Interestingly, the employees of the Shangdong Arts and Craft Company do not make art or craft supplies. <br /><br />Instead, Shangdong Arts and Craft was a cover for Chinese army officers, who traveled to Baghdad in an effort to sell Saddam Hussein advanced missile technology.<br /><br />&nbsp;It was certainly&nbsp; no surprise we found Saddam&#039;s most advanced weaponry had markers on it citing manufacture in France, Russia, Germany, Belgium and China. <br /><br /></div>

The secular Left has been in control of academia and&nbsp; the press&nbsp; for&nbsp; decades. They are the &#039;establishment.&#039;&nbsp; As far as Bill O&#039;Reilly, he&#039;s&nbsp; interesting, on some level, but, nowhere near&nbsp; the Niagra Falls of Leftists&nbsp; on the other side&nbsp; who are destroying&nbsp; the West from within, they are decidely in the majority. The &#039;Right-Wing&#039; in control is a myth invented&nbsp; by those&nbsp; in power. They use the term&nbsp; &#039;Neo-Con&#039; , like the Nazis and&nbsp; Communists&nbsp; used&nbsp; &#039;Jews&#039;, matter&nbsp; of fact most&nbsp; &#039;Neo-Cons&#039; were/are &#039;Jews&#039;, it&#039;s&nbsp; a code&nbsp; word&nbsp; by the Left.<br /><br />Plenty&nbsp; of people&nbsp; take me seriously, and&nbsp; I don&#039;t&nbsp; know&nbsp; who these&nbsp; &#039;no&nbsp; ones&#039; who will not take me seriously&nbsp; now are, I suspect&nbsp; the same&nbsp; 10 or 12 people&nbsp; who post here and give &#039;nods&#039;&nbsp; to each other&nbsp; and pat themselves&nbsp; about how they don&#039;t hate anyone, except people not like them.

Most people here are pretty smart and good-natured and willing to hear your side of the story, but your posts have been really critical and not left any room for an actual discussion. I know that lots of people on this board would be willing to engage in an intelligent conversation on the merits and flaws of our war policies and the President, but your first post set the tone of this being a conversation like this:<br /><br />A: I know this is true!<br />B: What about X?<br />A: It&#039;s true!<br />C: Don&#039;t you think C should come into play?<br />A: No, what I said is true and anyone who disagrees is [stereotype here].<br /><br />This is why my only further contribution to this thread will be puppies.<br /><br /><img src="http://uk.gizmodo.com/puppies.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /></div>
