				Hi Everyone,<br /><br /><br />I currently live in VT and will be starting at CUNY Law in August.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve encountered some difficulty finding an apartment thus far. I&#039;m looking to sign a lease for July 1st with a budget of around $1650/month in Astoria. <br /><br /><br />The problem is that I will not have any income while I am in school (aside from federal loans) and my guarantor does not make the required 80x that brokers are requiring, as he&#039;s been retired for 3 years now. CUNY allocates around $1700/month for housing and I have proof of acceptance and loans. <br /><br /><br />I have volunteered to put down first, last, security, and August at the time of signing and then pay for 4-5 months IN ADVANCE when the first installment of my loans is disbursed on September 1st and then pay the remaining months rent in their entirety when the second disbursement of my loans is received in January. No luck. <br /><br /><br />Any advice or suggestions? <br /><br /><br />Thanks.

				There was an interesting article published by the NYTimes (&quot;You Say You&#039;re a Dream Renter? Prove It&quot; by Jim Rendon July 15th, 2011) that discussed these challenges.&nbsp; One of the most interesting things I learned from reading that article was their reference to a company, Insurent, that insures leases.<br />In a nutshell, a Renter who might not be considered qualified (student, low credit score, no guarantor, etc) can pay a fee to purchase a policy that will guarantee the lease and rent payments in the event of default.&nbsp; If I recall correctly, their fee was a month&#039;s rent, or something like that.<br />Here&#039;s a link to the article:&nbsp; http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/17/realestate/prospective-renters-have-much-to-prove-to-landlords.html (http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/17/realestate/prospective-renters-have-much-to-prove-to-landlords.html)&nbsp; and here&#039;s a link to the Insurent website:&nbsp; http://www.insurent.com/index.shtml (http://www.insurent.com/index.shtml)<br />Hope this info helps.&nbsp; &nbsp;Good Luck!&nbsp; &nbsp;Cheers&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;
