				Does anyone know of any resources where I can find out about juried exhibitions? I am already a member of the Organization of Indep. Artists in the City but was wondering if there were any other places I could check out to find out more.

				One place that I peruse sometimes is www.nyfa.org (http://www.nyfa.org)<br />They have job openings as well as opportunities for artists- shows, workshops etc....I was recently in a large group show in Chelsea called The Square Foot Show, and that&#039;s how I found it :roll:<br />Also, if you google things like &quot;art deadlines&quot; etc you&#039;ll find different sites with listings. Some are free and some you need to pay for....<br />there&#039;s a free extensive listing of shows/opportunities that you can sign up for- and you&#039;ll get an email with the list. Just send a blank email to this address: artdeadlineslist-subscribe@topica.com<br /><br />Most art magazines will also have a few listings in the back as well!<br /><br />Other than that of course, just chat with other local artists and share info :mrgreen:<br />Also, I&#039;m a big believer in alternative showing venues. So think outside of the box- restaurants, coffee shops, businesses that have extra wall space...many of these places are looking for some great art- and will not take the standard 50-60% commission fee that established galleries do! Some will take a much smaller percentage of any work you sell, or some will take none, and just get to benefit from free decoration...<br /><br />If I think of any other places to look I&#039;ll let ya know. Good luck and keep us updated on your finds!<br />

Someone just emailed me the link to NYFA and i checked it out and love it! Someone told me about Arts Calendar, too and I will be sure to look into them. I like your suggestions about showing art outside of the traditional art scene. I was thinking about doing a little show of my own in a small space with some great food. With the weather being warmer, it&#039;ll be a great opportunity to peruse the scenes to see if local businesses and cafes will be&nbsp; interested in displaying. <br /><br />Hey, maybe we could have a local Astorian art show!&nbsp; :wink:

				If you absolutely must pay to have your slides viewed, The Art List is a subscription-based list of jurried competitions (and some non-jurried calls for proposals) broken down by state and deadline. It costs $15 bucks per year and is pretty extensive:<br /><br />http://www.theartlist.com/<br /><br />May I ask why you are seeking juried exhibitions? Is it the cash prizes? These things normally cost money to enter and don&#039;t seem to reflect well on your artists resume since they are basically cattle calls. I&#039;ve been to many discussions with featured artists at Cue Art Foundation and Artists Space and they will tell you the same thing. Ditto for the vanity galleries where you pay to have your exhibit up. Curators and serious galleries will look at these on your resume and know exactly what they are.&nbsp; I understand why the guest curators do it--for the extra cash. But most artists don&#039;t have the extra cash to spend on $5-per-slide-with-a-four-slide-minimum contests. <br /><br />I&#039;d stick to the free listings (NYFA.org is great) and make sure you submit your work to Artists Space, White Collumns, and the other NYC slide registries for starters...<br />
