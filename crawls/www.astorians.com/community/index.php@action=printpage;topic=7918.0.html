				At long last, my passport is expiring.&nbsp; Since my life&#039;s goal was to get as many stamps in it as possible, I am hesitant to part with it because it&#039;s represents 10 years of traveling abroad.&nbsp; I&#039;m sentimental.&nbsp; Does anyone know if The Man returns your old passport when you apply for a new one?&nbsp; The website vaguely says they do but I want to hear from someone: &quot;Yes, when I sent in my expired passport to get a new one, both came back in the mail.&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />And if they don&#039;t, would be easier to just say I lost it and apply for a new one altogether?&nbsp; Does that take much longer?&nbsp; Is that legal?&nbsp; It is much more of a hassle?&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve already been to the website but for some reason, I don&#039;t trust it.&nbsp;

				Yes, it does come back but expect it to take almost 2 months or more.&nbsp; There is a backlog in passport applications, don&#039;t wait til the last minute.

				Awesome.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard the backlog is pretty bad right now.&nbsp; I&#039;m not planning to go anywhere until May but just in case someone wants to spontaneously whisk me to Paris for lunch *hint hint* I want to be ready.&nbsp;

				A problem I really am really well-versed in resolving! I also love my well-stamped expired passports. I have every passport I&#039;ve owned since I was a child. But, I have to honest and tell you that it wasn&#039;t because they were returned to me. My sister&#039;s old passport wasn&#039;t returned and I watched her cry. For the past 3 decades I simply say LOST and provide all the other info and VOILA I don&#039;t have to worry about mine disappearing in the shuffle! I have all of my Mom&#039;s expired passports. They date back to 1906. I consider them my personal treasure.

				I never went anywhere I needed a possport, but it&#039;s always better to lie and make sure you get to keep it. I did, however, go to Cuba in 1958 and 1959 and was almost shot&nbsp; by a soldier simply because I made a little joke about Castro which I cannot repeat here less I get another warning e mail from the moderator.

Everytime you enter back into the U.S., you&#039;ll be questioned (long waiting time in another room) to see if passport is a bona fide document, since the original document was reported lost. :mrgreen:

				Okay, I know you were all on the edge of your seats about this one.&nbsp; 8-)<br /><br />The old passport came back, stamps intact, in a separate mailing from the new passport.&nbsp; There&#039;s a &quot;cancelled&quot; stamp on the front page of the old one.&nbsp; The whole process only took 15 days from when I mailed the old one to when I received the new one.&nbsp; I guess the backlog is not so bad now.&nbsp; <br /><br />The new passports are stiffer and VERY patriotic.
