				She&#039;s an alcoholic and possibly mentally disturbed.&nbsp; From what I&#039;ve seen, she&#039;s dangerous.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen her fighting with people right by the train station

				Yes, I am willing to give most people the benefit of the doubt, but she is disturbed and possibly dangerous.&nbsp; I saw her physically attack on of the delivery guys from the pizza place under the tracks a while back.&nbsp; Called 911, but they weren&#039;t interested.&nbsp;
