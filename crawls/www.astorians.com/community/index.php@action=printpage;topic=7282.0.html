				Has anyone ever heard of the movement to have New York City made into its own state?<br /><br />http://www.nycstatehood.org<br /><br />Most interesting tidbit from this site so far (quoting the FAQ):<br /><br />&quot;Who Is Leading the Effort for Statehood?<br /><br />NYC statehood is a grassroots effort. No one has taken a clear leadership position in this effort, although some prominent New Yorkers have stepped forward to lend their support. Norman Mailer started the ball rolling with his 1967 mayoral campaign. U.S. Representative Bella Abzug picked up the baton in her 1976 run for the Senate. Currently, <strong>city councilman Peter J. Vallone, Jr. is the most prominent advocate.</strong>&quot;

				Interesting!&nbsp; There was talk of it in 1969, when Lindsay was running for re-election, but nothing ever came of it.&nbsp; The New Yorker had a cartoon showing a guy in a bar saying: &quot;I think the new state should be called New York.&nbsp; Let the apple knockers find another name.&quot;

				I love how the NYMag article (Aug 9, 2004) on the nycstatehood website above says that we have dibs on the name New York.&nbsp; Let the upstate change to Buffalo.&nbsp; Now the question is... how many of you are for or against secession.&nbsp; If you are for the secession, would you want to secede from New York State only?&nbsp; or the United States?

				Norman Mailer, great&nbsp; writer, but,m has defended nuts&nbsp; &nbsp;and wacko ideas throughout his career. It&#039;s already a&nbsp; State of the the USA, making it&nbsp; a state within a state&nbsp; would create&nbsp; chaos.

				5 boroughs + Nassau and Suffolk counties. Maybe Westchester. I&#039;m all for it. But it seems as if this movement would leave LI in Albany&#039;s clutches. Bad idea. There&#039;s good income/property that NYC would need to plunder.&nbsp; :wink:<br /><br />Then they can name the rest of the state Clinton, which is fitting given that it&#039;s both an old and new NY political dynasty...

				I am definately for the secession of New Amsterdam!&nbsp; Maintain trade ties and a single currency with the old USA as well as customs agreements so its not a big production.&nbsp; Such arrangements do exist in the Vatican, San Marino, Singapore, Lichenstien.<br /><br />Once we are our own country, we can enact our own laws, without having to worry what albany or washington says:<br />Legalize gay marriage,<br />Protect civil liberties,<br />Immigration laws which benefit us instead of kansas,<br />Pro-choice,<br />Anti-death penalty,<br />Congestion pricing,<br /><br />When the south rises again, I say that&#039;s when we make our move.&nbsp;
