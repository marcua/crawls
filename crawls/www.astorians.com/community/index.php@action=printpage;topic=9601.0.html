				My name is Abby.&nbsp; &nbsp; I have completed a 200 hour yoga teacher training program and I am certified to teach students of all levels.&nbsp; &nbsp;My program was quite extensive.&nbsp; We studied what is refered to as both the “subtle” and the “physical” body and thus gained an understanding of yoga as both a mental, spiritual, and highly physical practice.&nbsp; My teacher training program, therefore also focused on anatomy and taught us how to modify each and every posture for those with certain injuries or lack of flexibility<br /><br />Last year, I taught yoga at my law school.&nbsp; This was a great opportunity to see yoga’s benefits at work.&nbsp; Students were pressed for time, stressed, and needed a quick way to get fit.&nbsp; Our one-hour yoga classed focused on flexibility (sitting and studying is very hard on your body) and stress reduction.<br /><br />I am interested in teaching a class that offers a great mind-body workout.&nbsp; I am able to teach all levels and enjoy working with both beginners and more advanced practitioners.<br />I am available weeknights and weekends.&nbsp;

				How much do you charge and where do you do the lessons?&nbsp; I ask because my apt. is too small to do something like that

				Hello, Thanks for your response.&nbsp; Where we do yoga is up to you.<br />My apartment has space and I live in Astoria.&nbsp; If you do not mind coming to my place, we can set up mats in the living room.&nbsp; <br /><br />The other option is to rent studio space. There are many locations in manhattan and probably Queens.&nbsp; I can look into that as well.<br /><br />If we meet in Astoria, the class would be $45/hour, however, that is negotiable.&nbsp; If we meet at a studio, we would have to figure in that cost.&nbsp; If you had a friend, I could teach you both and then you could split the cost.&nbsp; I think studio rental is generally around $20.&nbsp; <br /><br />What are your thoughts?<br /><br />Abby

				Hello there.&nbsp; My certification is from Sonic Yoga in Manhattan.&nbsp; The style that I teach is Vinyasa.&nbsp; It incorporates the asana (postures) of Ashtanga but the practice is defined by the way the breath and the poses are linked together.&nbsp; Yogajournal.com has great information on the different schools of Yoga.&nbsp; Vinyasa can be fast and dynamic or we can slow things down based on level and interest.<br /><br />You should try a class. <br /><br />Abby

				Just ran across your yoga ad, and I&#039;m very interested in finding out more. . . Have you found a space to rent for a class?&nbsp; Could I try out one of your classes?<br /><br />Cheers! :)

				Hi Abby,<br /><br />I&#039;m very interested in arranging some classes with you.&nbsp; Are you still teaching private classes?&nbsp; I live in Astoria and have good space in my apartment, or can travel to you if convenient.<br /><br />Thanks!
