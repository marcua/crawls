				without naming names (yet), here is my situation...<br /><br />I just rented a place on 30 Ave (x-street 49th). I was under the impression that this was located in Astoria - and my lease agreement back that up with an Astoria address. As I began to prepare to move, I noticed most maps listed this address as Woodside - I chalked this up to being really close to the border and computer error. But when I moved in, I checked everyone else at my address&#039; mail - Woodside.<br /><br />I feel I have been duped by the realtor and my landlord. What I thought was a good deal on an Astoria apartment, isn&#039;t such a good deal if it&#039;s a Woodside apt. I can&#039;t really raise too much of an issue with my landlord, since I have to deal with him for the next year (and moving really isn&#039;t much of an option). I like the place, don&#039;t mind the location, but still feel duped. So I am going to call the realtor and request 50% of my broker&#039;s fee back. If they do not, I will name names here, report them to the BBB, and any real estate organizations they belong too.<br /><br />Am I being unreasonable here? Any other options?

				Your zip code probably is a Woodside p.o, just like 11102 used to be listed as LIC until recently. The &quot;older&quot; Astorians can speak on that one better.&nbsp; <br /><br />I consider that area to be Astoria.&nbsp; I always thought that if you pass the BEQ or go south of Northern Boulevard, around the Old Navy, you would be entering Woodside, but that&#039;s just me.<br /><br />I can&#039;t vouch for these sites, but check this out:<br /><br />http://maxhome.netfirms.com/overview.htm<br /><br />http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9905E5DC1538F93BA25751C1A962958260<br /><br />

				<br /><br />First, I am sorry you feel duped.<br />I think most people in Astoria would say you are in Astoria.&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />2 - More Marley. What exactly does the difference mean Astoria v Woodside v LIC?<br /><br />3 - Maybe it is me. But the note made me laugh. I often joke trying to figure out when I am &#039;in&#039; Astoria, and when I am out.&nbsp; I think Astoria is about a 3 block radius of where I get off of the train.<br /><br /><br />In summary: sorry, more Marley, thanks.

				I was going to modify my post, but I&#039;ll just put another one out there:<br /><br />There is a bar located at 47th Street and 30th Avenue, two blocks west, and they are definitely considered Astoria. &nbsp;<br /><br />While the lines are often blurry between neighborhoods, I would have to say in the case of Astoria and Woodside, it&#039;s fairly well defined because of the BEQ and St. Michael&#039;s Cemetary to the east and as previously mentioned Northern Boulevard on the southeast border. &nbsp;I could be wrong, but that was always my understanding.

				my zip on the lease is 11106<br /><br />my zip on maps and everyone else&#039;s mail at my house is 11377<br /><br />the landlord probably knows it&#039;s Woodside but listed as Astoria to get more $$. like i said, i could take this up with him but i have to deal with him for the next 350-something days. i feel if the realtor had done his job, he would have known this was Woodside. i spoke with him but says they don&#039;t check addresses like that, it was submitted to them as Astoria so they listed it as Astoria. I call B.S., the realtor should know exactly where the lines are.<br /><br />also of note - i noticed that the 2x/week alternate side of the street parking ends on either 46/47th street. the rest of the blocks have no alternate side cleaning schedule. so apparently NYC Dept of Sanitation thinks i live in Woodside too.

				I believe 49th Street is the borderline between Astoria and Woodside from Astoria to Northern Boulevards.&nbsp; On 31st Avenue, Bryant High School is 11103 and across the street in the Woodside Houses is 11377.&nbsp; Don&#039;t know if this helps.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if they divide 49th Street down the middle of the road or not.<br /><br />Oh, and Astoria is/was considered part of Long Island City - if my memory serves me - along with Woodside, Sunnyside and Dutch Kills.&nbsp; I remember living in Woodside and getting mail with Long Island City, NY&nbsp; 11377.&nbsp; This may be officially different now.&nbsp; I think is was part of the Post Office plan to make a &quot;Queens, NY&quot; - to match the other boroughs, but the people of Queens refused to give up the original town names.<br /><br />Actually the area of Astoria was once known as Hallett&#039;s Cove and Sunswick was also an area designation (approximately the area where the bar is located) at one time, long ago.<br /><br />A few years ago, I mailed a letter to myself and used the address Hallett&#039;s Cove, NY 11103 and the Post Office delivered it!&nbsp; I guess they probably just deliver by zip code now.

				I didn&#039;t realize that Woodside was so much less expensive than Astoria.&nbsp; When I was looking at apartments two years ago, it was just as much money and most 1 bedrooms were going for 1100 and up to 1300 a month.&nbsp; Woodside is really nice, and I would have been happy living there, Astoria, or Sunnyside.&nbsp; The postal system here and how they figure out addresses is all messed up anyway.&nbsp; It&#039;s like the big debate between what&#039;s LIC and what&#039;s Astoria.&nbsp; I&#039;ve asked around, and I&#039;m told it&#039;s your zip code that gets you your mail.&nbsp; I think you are living near the border of Woodside, LIC, and Astoria, and you&#039;ll end up getting mail that&#039;ll say all three.&nbsp; I sure did, when I lived there.&nbsp; I don&#039;t see much difference in the rents, as they are all great places to live.&nbsp; If there should be a reduction in rent, it should be based on how far it&#039;s from the train, and the quality of the apartment in general.&nbsp; Which it is darn far from the train and most action.

				In regard to the whole zip code thing, the first three numbers of your zip code is known at the prefix, and I think that&#039;s used to direct your mail through a general sorting facility.&nbsp; Queens has three different zip code prefixes that I can think of (while I think the other boroughs only have one each): 111- zip codes go through Long Island City, 113- go through Flushing, and 114- go through Jamaica.&nbsp; I bet the OP could put Flushing on his mail, and as long as he put the 11377 zip code on there, she/he would get mail.&nbsp; My buddy always puts &quot;Queens&quot; on his mail (he&#039;s a die-hard Queens kid who&#039;s jealous of the other boroughs) and he gets his mail just fine.&nbsp; The mail is totally driven by the zip code.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Tough call, but I don&#039;t think you were really duped in that you knew the location of the apartment. they were mis-representing the town perhaps, but isn&#039;t that something you can find out once you look at? If you like the place and area, why does it matter if it&#039;s Astoria or Woodside? This seems like semantics. You probably just have buyers remorse and will be fine.

				Long Island City encompasses Astoria, Sunnyside, Woodside. Dutch Kills, Ravensview, Bridge, and that really industrial&nbsp; part that is booming now, that we have always called LIC. My guess is that it doesn&#039;t have another designation because no one really lived there before fifty years ago, and because it was its own incorporated town before it joined Queens. <br />So, at one point there was not the whole 5 borough thing, and I think LIC joined Queens/NYC in 1898. There&#039;s a few books by an historian Seyfried that better explains it (and I presume others). (i&#039;ve always found this interesting)<br />Anyway, as far as 49th street- it is the last block in Astoria when moving towards the east. The zip is usually 11103 south of the BQE. North of the BQE 49th street is Definitely astoria- and very old school astoria, till it is bounded at the north by the water. In that area, just after 49 there is Hazen Street and then seventy-something street. This little trickery is attributable to that also being a really old part of Queens, and when they laid it out in a new grid that part just wouldn&#039;t conform. It is known as &quot;East Elmhurst.&quot; (Which is code for &quot;near the bridge to Rikers&quot; --one of the oldest houses in Queens is by there.)<br />When traveling south on 49th, it stops being part of Astoria at Broadway. Many people who live south of B&#039;way but north of 25A (northern blvd) say they live in Astoria out of convenience, but it is technically not Astoria, it is Long island City (and the zip at Steinway south of B&#039;way is 11101). South of 25a is Woodside, only east of 49th street. West of 49th south of 25a it is Sunnyside.<br />I&#039;d say Sunnyside is the most undervalued, btw.(and not in the following list of zips) But if you are into searching for real estate by the zip codes, you are looking for 11101-11106. If you look at it in zillow.com (site realtors use) you can really get a sense of it.

				Here&#039;s background info (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island_City) on Long Island City.&nbsp; It was created by the consolidation of several communities in 1870, just as NYC was created by the consolidation of the five counties into the five boroughs in 1898, and it was actually an early part of the larger consolidation.<br /><br />From the link:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Long Island City was created in 1870 from the communities of Astoria, Hunters Point, Blissville, Ravenswood, Dutch Kills, Bowery Bay, Steinway, and Sunnyside, all in the western part of the Town of Newtown, westernmost township in Queens County. The neighborhood of Middleton was dissolved because the U.S. Post Office refused to recognize two locations with that name in the same state, and there existed a town of that name in Orange County. The heavily industrialized Long Island City was one of the three cities whose approval was necessary to create the City of Greater New York in 1898.<br /><br />The term LIC is now mostly used for the south-western part of the former city (ZIP code 11101). The border with Astoria is very vague; in ZIP codes 11106, 11102 and 11105 some locals prefer the term &quot;Astoria&quot; (for the convenience or the status), while others (esp. long-time residents and artists) prefer to be associated with the long history of Long Island City.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So yes, even those of us who live up by Ditmars technically live in Long Island City.&nbsp; &quot;Astoria, NY&quot; is not recognised by the USPS, and I&#039;ve occasionally had the issue come up when I&#039;ve ordered things online or over the phone.&nbsp; I tell them, &quot;Astoria, NY 11105&quot;, and if they are using the USPS data, they say, &quot;there is no such place.&quot;&nbsp; My other half&#039;s license says &quot;[our address], Long Island City, NY 11105&quot;, and mine says, &quot;[our address], Astoria, NY&quot;.<br /><br />Astoria Luv - I assume you are referring to the BQE?

				Apologies in advance for the long-ish post...<br /><br />I’m sorry you’re feeling duped and I don’t want to tell you how to feel but it seems to me you are splitting hairs on this one. <br /><br />You live right near the ‘technical’ border between Astoria and Woodside (I’m assuming you are on 30th Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets) some people put the border at 49th Street, others at 50th Street or Hobart Street.<br /><br />Regardless of where the border is, given the irregularity of the street grid in this area, I would, and I think most people who live around you consider this part of Astoria -- not Woodside -- since geographically, commercially, socially it’s more closely linked to Astoria. <br /><br />No one ripped you off. Though you may not agree, Woodside isn’t any less expensive than Astoria and you aren’t paying more for a low-class address – in fact you’re living in one of the best parts of Astoria my opinion. <br /><br />You have the choice of two subway lines (RGV and the NW), are as closely linked to Manhattan as the others parts of the neighborhood and additionally to the rest of Queens, which the majority of Astorians are not.<br /><br />And you’re in walking distant of Dilliger’s bar, Sorriso’s deli and Gian Pierro’s bakery – which are all tops.<br /><br />Note: Postal zones do not always follow traditional neighborhood boundaries or carry the same names for that matter. Queens is divided into three main postal zones:<br /><br />LIC -- zips starting with 111<br />Flushing -- zips starting with 113<br />Jamaica -- zips starting with 114<br /><br />(That’s why LIC, Flushing, and Jamaica outrank individual neighborhood names on your mail.)<br /><br />So even if your zip begins with 113 it doesn’t mean you live in Woodside, only that your mail is delivered through the Flushing postal zone. One thing is incorrect though, run your address on the usps.gov website. If you’re in Astoria/LIC you should be in 11103 not 11106.&nbsp; <br /><br />The same thing applies to the upper Ditmars blocks between 49 street and LaGuardia airport. They are technically considered Jackson Heights, though most residents would call it Astoria, given it’s linked more closer to Ditmars and Steinway and since the area is cut off from the rest of JH by the Grand Central.&nbsp; <br />

				Murph, if it means anything, most of what is now known as Astoria isn&#039;t really Astoria proper.<br /><br />Astoria proper is really just the small square north of the BQE and I&#039;d guess to the west of Steinway (11105 area code?).&nbsp; The area referred to as Astoria grew because realtors found it to be a more fashionable/marketable name.&nbsp; 30th Avenue and Boradway are not a part of Astoria proper.&nbsp; The same phenomenon occured with Park Slope and Chelsea is probably undergoing the same now.<br /><br />Of course, none of that really matters because people refer to Astoria as a neighborhood, rather than a bordered designation.&nbsp; So it really shouldn&#039;t matter to you what the post office calls it, but how well it integrates with the neighbordhood.

				Frappe -- I&#039;m curious, what do you base your boundaries on?<br /><br />I&#039;ve always considered the boundary line for Astoria as roughly everything north of 34th Avenue, from the river to roughly 49th Street or 50th Street -- not just the small part of the 11105 zip as you describe.<br /><br />Broadway and Grand Avenues are most certainly part of Astoria, always have been, at least as long as my family has been here and long before there was ever such a thing as a real estate industry (at least as we know it today)

				http://www.astorialic.org/neighborhoods/neighborhoods_p.php<br /><br />I read it a while ago when I was doing research on the area, but here can be a start.&nbsp; Suppose a combination of Old Astoria and Astoria Park, so it hugs the water more.&nbsp; I&#039;ll try and get a better reference.&nbsp; <br /><br />The real estate industry has been around just after the first farmer decided to sell their first lot to a developer.&nbsp;
