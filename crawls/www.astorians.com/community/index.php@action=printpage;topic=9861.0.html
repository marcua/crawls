				Hey parents!<br />My cousin is having a baby girl in a few months and I&#039;m attending the baby shower in a few weeks.&nbsp; Very exciting time.&nbsp; I&#039;ve already bought some standard baby stuff but I&#039;m wondering if anyone could recommend a great gift that might not be on the registry.&nbsp; Something a new mom-to-be might not think of.&nbsp; What&#039;s the one thing you wish you&#039;d had for the first few months after the new arrival?&nbsp; Or is there something you wish you&#039;d had for yourself at a time when the new baby gets all the attention?&nbsp; Or, just finish this sentence: &quot;When you have a new baby, you can never have enough _______.&quot; (&quot;Sleep&quot; and other non-tangible nouns don&#039;t count as an answer, since I can&#039;t provide sleep. At least without breaking Federal law by giving her some of my magic pills.)<br /><br />Thanks in advance!<br /><br />(http://www.smiliesarena.com/emoticons/Main/Baby/laugh.gif)

				&nbsp;:-D<br />This is really sweet of you.<br /><br />There are 2 gifts I received that I didn&#039;t register for and absolutely LOVED.&nbsp; The first is a Miracle Blanket- it is for swaddling newborns and makes swaddling so much easier (especially in the middle of the night after a feeding!)&nbsp; I think they sell them at Buy Buy Baby and you can find it online. They are around $25.<br />The second is for when the baby gets a bit older- the Me Too Portable Highchair.&nbsp; It is a little foldable chair that you can hook on to almost any table, and it&#039;s much more secure than the highchairs commonly found in restaurants.&nbsp; My daughter starting using hers around 5 months.&nbsp; It is small enough to fold up in my diaper bag.&nbsp; It&#039;s great for going out to eat, but also wonderful for travel- no need to worry about high chairs.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t seen it sold in stores, but you can find it online.&nbsp; I think it retails for around $40.<br /><br />You can never have enough diapers!&nbsp; She&#039;ll probably receive plenty, but if you do decide to purchase some, I would go for 1&#039;s or 2&#039;s- most babies grow out of the N&#039;s pretty quickly, and they send you home rom the hospital with a bunch.<br />Congratulations to your cousin!

				I just had my baby shower, and the things I really appreciated were &#039;older&#039; clothing. I got great stuff, but about thirty sundresses that were birth to three months, and this is the time when they live in their onesies...but it was great to get some things for one-year because no one things of it, and by then i&#039;m going to need more clothes and those things add up...

				Hmmm... That gives me an idea.&nbsp; Maybe I&#039;ll go to Target and get the same outfit in every size.&nbsp; That way, it will always fit! <br /><br />Or is that too silly?

				That&#039;s actually not a bad idea if you want to spend the $$- it was great getting outfits in larger sizes (and I agree, while the frilly dresses in 0-3 are absolutely adorable, my daughter lived in onesis that young).&nbsp; The only thing to be careful about is seasonal clothing.&nbsp; Lily was a pipsqueak, and never grew into some of the beautiful summer clothes people bought her in the 3-6 month size (she was born in April).&nbsp; She&#039;ll be 2 next month and still wears size 12-18 months! I would stick to things that can be worn throughout the year (cotton pants and light long sleeve shirts, jammies, etc.) :-)

				If you go to Target now, you will get a great deal on winter clothes that are on clearance. You can buy the 6-9 month size and the baby should fit into this by next winter. My sister had twins 9 months ago and she got tons of clothes for ages 0-9 months. Last minute she had to go on a major shopping spree for new clothes for the girls since they had outgrown the smaller baby clothes. The Children&#039;s Place on Steinway also had a large clearance section about 2 weeks ago, mostly winter clothes.<br /><br />I also bought my sister something called My Brest Friend. It is a pillow that you can use while breastfeeding the baby. Since she had twins, this was especially handy for feeding both babies at the same time. I guess it is similar to the Boppi, but she has suggested this to every new mom-to-be she knows.<br />http://www.mybrestfriend.com/<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Ohhh,those are some great ideas.&nbsp; I love my My Breast&nbsp; Friend -- it&#039;s the best nursing pillow out there, IMO.&nbsp; The swaddling blankets are hit or miss -- only one of my four liked to be swaddled but boy am I LOVING&nbsp; them now!!!&nbsp; I got half a dozen or so with some handmedowns and she sleeps in one every nap and bedtime.<br /><br />If I was going to give a baby shower gift with unlimited funds, I&#039;d probably give her a basket with a sling (cloth baby carrier, I&#039;d choose a wrap style sling), some books (Elizabeth Pantley&#039;s No Cry&nbsp; Sleep Solution and the Happiest Baby on the Block, author unknown, and the Baby Book by Dr and Mrs Sears, So That&#039;s What&nbsp; They&#039;re&nbsp; For,author unknown and Take Charge of your Child&#039;s Health by Dr Wootan), and some cd&#039;s with lullabyes.&nbsp; If you know she&#039;s going to nurse, super soft LANA breastpads are wonderful.&nbsp; Miracle Salve is fantastic for mom for after the birth *and* for using on the baby.&nbsp; A bed tray with remote control for a lamp, a nalgene or stainless steel water bottle would make a nice themey gift,too.<br /><br />I could keep going...

				Those are some good ideas.&nbsp; I ended up getting an assortment of things.&nbsp; Some clothing for the first year, some blankets, a little bathrobe, two books, one rattle-type toy, baby wipes.&nbsp; And a box of chocolates for my cousin.&nbsp; I might get some other stuff along the way.&nbsp;

				It&#039;s a bit late since I was off the boards for a while but I got my firends who had baby boys the Dangerous Book for Boys and they loved it, especially the dads. Totally earmarked all the stuff they&#039;re going to do as they get older.<br />There is a Daring Book for Girls, and there has yet to be a girl birth in my friend circle since publication to give me the excuse to gift it.

				One thing I like to give to new moms once the baby is born is a gift certificate for a manicure/pedicure--one with a foot/calf massage is great!&nbsp; Standard for this neighborhood is $15 mani/pedi and $25-35 for mani/spa pedi with massage.&nbsp; It&#039;s just a nice quick break all about you when you really need it (most don&#039;t get to use for 3 months or so!)

				If you get outfits in larger sizes, it is definitely a great idea and I really appreciated those at my shower as well, but make sure they are appropriate for the season it will be when the baby reaches that age. I got a lot of summer clothes in the 6-9 month size, but I am due in July... which means the baby would start fitting into those clothes in like Nov--not exactly the season for madras pants and t-shirts! so I had a ton of exchanging to do--without gift receipts which was annoying so please remember to include gfit receipts!
