			<strong>Jerry Kann</strong>:
			<br />
			I tried posting on the topic of &quot;Why I'm running for City Council in Astoria&quot; about six weeks ago. I haven't gotten any responses yet. So I thought I'd try again. This time I'll be much briefer.<br /><br />I want our government to be much more open and democratic. If elected, I will:<br /><br />* hold regular (at least monthly) public meetings to get the input of the people who live here in Astoria<br /><br />* promote the idea of **elected** Community Boards throughout New York, to replace the undemocratic appointed Boards that we have now<br /><br />* revamp the Rent Guidelines Board and generally try to make city and state government more accountable to tenants<br /><br />* support a statewide drive to allow same-sex couples to marry<br /><br />* support a city and state initiative to allow non-citizens (legal immigrants) to vote in local elections<br /><br />See, the whole emphasis is on opening things up so the **average person** has more power. And at the **local** and **community** level, we can deal with each other face-to-face. We can really interact, really communicate like human beings. And I mean everybody in Astoria. There will be a lot of disagreement and noisy arguments at the meetings I want to hold. But at least people will be talking to each other and starting to take control of their own government.<br /><br />Please, those of you who read this, I'd love to hear your feedback. Please post a response. And think about the idea somebody posted a while back for a Political Discussion Group.<br /><br />People should also feel free to visit my campaign website, KannForCouncil.net, or call me on the telephone. The number's 718-728-1092.<br /><br />Thanks so much-------Jerry Kann, Green Party candidate for City Council in Astoria

			I'll vote for you. &nbsp;You'd think there'd be others who would seek out their constiuents (or potentials) by getting on the community bulletin boards - apparently Jerry, you beat the heckle out of whomever you're running against. <br /><br />Now can we talk about all the frickin garbage all over the streets/sidewalks in our lovely neighborhood. &nbsp;It's driving me NUTS<br /><br /><br />Jen

			Jerry, we have to take back our government and get rid of all the <br />special interests that make it work against us rather than for us..

			What type of issues do you really vote on? I realize that we are not going to have anything on same sex marriage at city level right now. but other types of things are actually being voted on right now.
