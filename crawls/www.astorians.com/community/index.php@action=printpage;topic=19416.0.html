				I hope you don&#039;t mind if I take some time to write about this issue. Right now, I am very sad and need to put these words down somewhere on the internet. I&#039;m not sure why....it just feels right. <br /><br />I served my country for 7 years. When I first signed up in 1984, I came across the question on my application asking if I had ever engaged in homosexual activity. I answered no. Even though I knew then it was a lie. The reason why is this....I was escaping from my home. I didn&#039;t know what to expect....but I knew I wanted to get away. And I wasn&#039;t going to let that question get in my way of leaving home. I had to get away. <br /><br />During my time in the Army, I always had that hanging on my neck. And a few times, when I forgot about that albatross, I let the cat out of the bag. And it resulted in situations that were difficult. <br /><br />The thing is, for me, I was happy to be in the Army. I have so many great memories that live with me to this day. I worked my as off and enjoyed it. <br /><br />And also, from the depths of my soul, the Army gave me the foundation to be a man. It gave me structure.....it gave me strength. I am who I am today because of the Army. I have been in a supervisory role with Barnes and Noble since the day I got out of the Army and got a civilian job because of the Army. I could not have done it without them. <br /><br />But now I must tell you of a moment that caused me much pain. One night, I got really drunk and.....well, you can guess. Word got out and a few weeks later, I was having lunch in the mess hall when I overheard two guys talking about kicking my ass because I was gay. This is not something I wanted or planned.<br /><br />&nbsp;I never ate in that mess hall again for two years. I ate at the PX diner. <br /><br />I have never thought of repealing DADT as allowing orgies in the showers. For me it is this, Giving the soldiers, such as me, the guidelines to be all we can be....and no that is not silly to me. I had a great experiance. But, I did not have the guidelines to make it work. Gay people do not go into the Army to have sex. We do it for many reasons. Pride in our country or lack of a job or whatever. <br /><br />I know this is difficult in some ways. But for me it is this......<br /><br />Laying out the rules to allow me to do my job. Maybe I would have met a fellow soldier and we woud have fallen in love with each other. But we would have been able to do our job.....because we knew the rules. I think today about a video on youtube of a gay couple getting married and everyone in the Regiment being there.....crossed swords as they walked down the aisle.....In Great Britain. <br /><br />Yeah, I get that some see it as wierd.<br /><br />But today, as the Senate voted.....<br /><br />I felt like a non human. <br /><br />I served my country....<br /><br />For seven years. <br /><br />With honor.<br /><br />My being gay.......<br /><br />If the Army had have given me the guidelines, it would have been so different.....instead, I felt different. And I don,t think I should have been forced to. <br /><br />I am gay...but I am an American. And I was a soldier in the Army. For seven years. And I am proud of that. I am so effing proud of that. More than you can ever know. <br /><br />

				No, I don&#039;t think that. You assume wrongly that I do. &nbsp;The problem would be men, or women, who are stright, having to share close quarters and showers with people who may take unwanted liking to them. &nbsp; If we put a bunch of straight men and women of age 18-25 in same showers every day, guess what?? &nbsp; &nbsp;That&#039;s why they are kept seperate.<br /><br />Also, like it or not, many peole don&#039;t want gays around them at all--not me, but that&#039;s way it is. &nbsp; Main two types in army are southerners and ghetto types, and many, believe it or not, are going to be very &#039;Gay friendly.&quot; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />We need military. If many refuse to join due to having to serve with gays, military will take a hit. &nbsp; As for flambouyant RuPauls, &nbsp;you said it, not me. &nbsp;I don&#039;t see that going over too well at all. &nbsp;I&#039;d even get pissed off at that. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				The US military is a huge organization and not all service members live on base or in same-sex barracks, sharing sleeping quarters and bathrooms. Even on base, some members of the military have their own rooms. Accommodations can be &#039;accommodated&#039; in many, but not all situations.<br /><br />The Israeli military allows gay people to serve openly, even in combat situations (as do women), yet remains an effective, cohesive fighting force.<br /><br />The problem with DADT is that too many times the Military ignores it so why bother having it in place? Many of the people discharged were done so after being outed by other people.

				I wonder, do the people like JoeyC who oppose it so vociferously -- civilians for whom the repeal of DADT would have no impact on whatsoever -- realize that there are gays and lesbians EVERYWHERE? We&#039;re doctors, lawyers, teachers, clergy, etc. People who you put your trust in to heal you when you&#039;re sick, take care of your legal affairs, teach your children, and look to for spiritual guidance. And odds are a gay person designed your clothing, cooked your meal at a fine restaurant, and wrote and recorded some of your favorite music too.<br /><br />We can do all of those things and do them well, without offending anyone, without our sexuality being an issue. Yet, when we want to proudly serve our country openly and honestly, the homophobia rages on and suddenly we&#039;re sexual predators checking out the guy or girl next to us while we shower. Really? I&#039;m shocked that people don&#039;t realize just how stupid that is.<br /><br />I can only hope that someday, people will realize that being gay and lesbian is about so much more than just sex. Note to heterosexuals: we&#039;re just like you. We&#039;re just as diverse, just as multi-dimensional. We worry about global warming, the state of the economy, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and health care reform too. And shockingly, some of us are fiscally conservative. Some of us are even more socially conservative than you&#039;d expect. But no, according to folks like JoeyC, we&#039;re only interested in sex. And we check people out ALL THE TIME. Because we can&#039;t be professional and do our jobs -- whether we&#039;re doctors, lawyers, teachers or clergy; designers, chefs, or musicians, or in the military-- because apparently, we&#039;re so distracted by all that sex. If that were true, this would be a far more dysfunctional world than it already is. <br /><br />DADT is destructive and discriminatory. It doesn&#039;t prevent gays and lesbians from being in the military, it prevents them from being out and being able to live their lives openly and proudly while serving their country in the most noble of ways. Why anyone would object to that is beyond me.<br />

				I spent 4 years in active in the NAVY and 8 years in the Reserve. I think there could be problems with either gender if say they put openingly &#039;hetero&#039; folks mixed in together. It&#039;s not that every man and woman is attracted to each other in close quarters, but, it would cause problems on a whole host of levels. This is why genders are kept separate in the Military. <br /><br />The subject at hand would present some of the same problems and that is why it&#039;s being debated. Sure, there are always people who hate others based on sex, gender and race, but, when one states that they are hetero-sexual, usually goes without saying, or Homo-sexual, it will create a problem if they are in close quarters.<br /><br />I knew gay folks in the Military and one lady, who happened to be lesbian, we became friends and we even joked around that liking women is&nbsp; something we have in common. :-) I wouldn&#039;t want her or any brave, honorable American to lose their career in the Military solely on the basis of&nbsp; being found out as gay or lesbian.<br /><br />My solution, like President Obama&#039;s tax compromise, won&#039;t make anyone happy, but, may be the only one at this time. Drop DADT, and base it all on behavior for everyone. I would also start an intergration, the final bias, of the genders. There is no reason male and females are separarted and true equality should have no bias.<br /><br />I would be surprised, even if the rule is dropped ,that anyone would come out to many folks, since most folks are not gay or lesbian. But, it would be the height of hypocricy and probably illegal, if the DADT law was dropped and they military or any govt. run agency still separated based on gender. The latter would be hetero-phobia and I&#039;m sure all those in favor of dropping DADT, me included, would be just as in favor of dropping gender bias across the board.
