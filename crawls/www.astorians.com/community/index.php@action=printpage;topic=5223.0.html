				Incompetence and fear of laibility... <br /><br />my mom was stuck on a plane for about 4 hours last night too... the planes couldn&#39;t take off because the runways were a mess and so there were no gates available for the planes that did manage to land...

				I&#39;m surprised it was JetBlue.&nbsp; For all its greatness, it messed up big time.&nbsp; So dumb, they couldn&#39;t let people walk off the plane into the terminal, I&#39;ve done it in other countries for goodness sake.&nbsp; Some airports have no gate passageway.

				Wow. I think if I was stuck on a plane for 11 hours you would probably have to scrape me off the ceiling because I would have exploded from anger. That is so ridiculous. I agree with Daisy- I am surprised to hear that it was Jet Blue, they are ussually such a great airline. What a nightmare.&nbsp; :evil:

				NEW YORK, NY (UPI) -- A little know dramatic story unfolded on Valentine&#39;s Day at one of New York&#39;s airports. Passengers on a Jet Rue airplane were trapped for over ten hours with 75 deadly snakes on a plane. Fortunately, actor Samuel Jackson was present on this plane and put to use skills he developed specifically for a movie which featured deadly snakes on a plane. When asked, Jackson said &quot;I never thought I&#39;d need to use this s*** in real life. It was different as I practiced for high altitude, but I still kicked those mother f***** slimy f****** a****.&quot;<br /><br />Officials with Jet Rue claimed that the snakes were to be taken to Aruba to be released into the wild as part of an animal rescue mission, but were mistakenly released by hungry passengers foraging for food and drink. &quot;We&#39;ll pack more pretzels next time,&quot; said flight attendant Sally Strummond.

				A bag can never be left on a plane if its owner is not with it.&nbsp; So to deplane, all the bags must be removed, which means more overtime, more lost bags and more delays.<br /><br />Then there are the work rules.&nbsp; A pilot is not permitted to work a certain number of hours in a row.&nbsp; So if you have a plane all loaded up, you&#39;ll do what you can to get it out. If you alight the aircraft, which is an hour long, and then immediately board it, thats another hour.&nbsp; If the math works out that the pilot will be in the air for one minute longer then the regs say, then the pilot must withdraw from work, and another pilot be found, which usually means the flight is cancelled.<br /><br />Then there are logistics: aside from servicing the masses of arriving/depart and delayed passengers, the airplanes do not have gates to dock at nor taxi space to manuver.&nbsp; Sometimes flights which arrived at the gates do not have pilots to move the empty planes away due to the above noted work rules.&nbsp; <br /><br />I wouldn&#39;t call it incompetance.&nbsp; I&#39;d call it a string of bad incidents which forced bad decisions.&nbsp; I got most of this from talking to my friend who works at JFK.&nbsp; Interesting to hear its inner workings.&nbsp; A huge byzantine set of rules which at times seem ridiculous all to prevent a lawsuit.

				I received an email from Jetblue today apologizing for the incident.&nbsp; Unfortunately sometimes things have to go terribly wrong in order for things to change...&nbsp; I fly Jetblue often and find that generally they are much more efficient and less expensive than most of the other domestic airlines and I genuinely think that while it was unexcusable and my heart goes out to those passengers, maybe other airlines will also adopt the &quot;Customer Bill of Rights&quot; that Jetblue has created.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Dear JetBlue Customers,<br /><br />We are sorry and embarrassed. But most of all, we are deeply sorry.<br /><br />Last week was the worst operational week in JetBlue&#039;s seven year history. Following the severe winter ice storm in the Northeast, we subjected our customers to unacceptable delays, flight cancellations, lost baggage, and other major inconveniences. The storm disrupted the movement of aircraft, and, more importantly, disrupted the movement of JetBlue&#039;s pilot and inflight crewmembers who were depending on those planes to get them to the airports where they were scheduled to serve you. With the busy President&#039;s Day weekend upon us, rebooking opportunities were scarce and hold times at 1-800-JETBLUE were unacceptably long or not even available, further hindering our recovery efforts. <br /><br />Words cannot express how truly sorry we are for the anxiety, frustration and inconvenience that we caused. This is especially saddening because JetBlue was founded on the promise of bringing humanity back to air travel and making the experience of flying happier and easier for everyone who chooses to fly with us. We know we failed to deliver on this promise last week. <br /><br />We are committed to you, our valued customers, and are taking immediate corrective steps to regain your confidence in us. We have begun putting a comprehensive plan in place to provide better and more timely information to you, more tools and resources for our crewmembers and improved procedures for handling operational difficulties in the future. We are confident, as a result of these actions, that JetBlue will emerge as a more reliable and even more customer responsive airline than ever before.<br /><br />Most importantly, we have published the JetBlue Airways Customer Bill of Rights—our official commitment to you of how we will handle operational interruptions going forward—including details of compensation. I have a video message to share with you about this industry leading action. <br /><br />You deserved better—a lot better—from us last week. Nothing is more important than regaining your trust and all of us here hope you will give us the opportunity to welcome you onboard again soon and provide you the positive JetBlue Experience you have come to expect from us. <br /><br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;Sincerely, <br /><br />&nbsp;<br />David Neeleman<br />Founder and CEO<br />JetBlue Airways <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
