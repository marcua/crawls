				&nbsp;fw-<br />Please join us for a Power for the People (PFP) Volunteer and Planning Meeting&nbsp; on <br /><strong>Saturday, April 28 at 11 am</strong> at All Saints Church hall <br />(43-12 46th St. in Sunnyside, one block north of the #7 train 46th St.-Bliss St. stop).<br />&nbsp;<br />This is the first PFP meeting in a while. It will give us a chance to catch everyone up on some of the group&#039;s work over the past few months. And to begin discussing plans for the future. We hope you will join us for a lively and fruitful discussion of:<br />&nbsp;<br />1. <strong>PSC Investigation of the Queens Power Outage</strong>. In January, the Public Service Commission&#039;s scathing report found Con Ed responsible for poor maintenance of the LIC network and poor handling of the July 2006 Queens Power Outage. PFP activists wrote two sets of comments on the report (read them at www.powerforthepeople.info). This week, the PSC finally decided to essentially put Con Ed on trial through a &quot;prudence proceeding,&quot; which can prevent Con Ed from passing on outage-related captial expenses to us as a rate hike. This is an important victory that everyone contributed to, which we will talk about at the meeting.<br />&nbsp;<br />2. <strong>Con Ed&#039;s request for settlement talks</strong>. Con Ed tried to short-circuit the prudence proceeding by offering settlement talks to resolve some issues (such as retroactive payment for our non-food losses). PFP wrote a letter opposing this strategy (read it at www.powerforthepeople.info). PFP activists will report on the first exploratory held April 16.<br />&nbsp;<br />3. Summer is coming: outage preparation. The PSC investigators say there is no way to know whether we could have another outage this summer because of stress on the network from last year&#039;s outage. A PFP activist with Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) training will talk about how to prepare.<br />&nbsp;<br />4. Future PFP Activities: These include a possible public forum on &quot;getting ready for summer &amp; outage preparation;&quot; a possible picket or other activity to protest Con Ed&#039;s new, 3-year rate hike request (due on May 4!); and a possible Flashlight March through the community on the first anniversary of the outage.<br />We look forward to seeing you at the April 28 meeting.<br /><br />Western Queens Power for the People Campaign <br />512-5442; www.powerforthepeople.info ; powerforthepeople2006 AT hotmail DOTcom<br />
