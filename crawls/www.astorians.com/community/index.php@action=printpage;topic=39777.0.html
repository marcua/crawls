				I saw they put up a sign where Razzies pizza used to be that says Burger Lab.&nbsp; It looks retro like Flattops sign.&nbsp; Let&#039;s see what this place will be like.&nbsp; The space is very small.

				I walked by when they had the door open and saw the inside of this place.&nbsp; They;re still working on it, but it looks nice.&nbsp; There is now exposed brick.&nbsp; I&#039;m still not sure what kind of place this will be with the strange name of Burger Lab.&nbsp; I&#039;m curious to find out.&nbsp; They&#039;ve been working on this place for a while now.

				It&#039;s not going to be the Lab grown meat... unless you want to pay thousands of dollars...<br /><br /><br />However, I believe the chain is originally based in New Zealand or Australia. It is yet ANOTHER attempt to &quot;gourmet&quot; a hamburger by putting it on a some kind of fancy roll and weird stuff on them and then charging $$$. They&#039;re behind the times by at least 2 years since I&#039;m sure this idea is as dated as Avocado Toast.

I&#039;m sure they&#039;ll do a Grand Opening. OR- they&#039;ll realize it&#039;s a waste of&nbsp; time and close up forever. Like a few other places in the area

				Ended up going there last night for dinner. Had the classic cheeseburger, sans grilled onions and mayo mustard. Very tasty, not sure if it is worth the price. It was busy though. Fries were very good, hand cut. <br />They also have something called &#039;nitro shakes&#039; three flavors, vanilla bean, chocolate nutella and berry. Didn&#039;t get that.<br /><br />

				I pass by this place every night on my way home and I see lots of people in there.&nbsp; They got 5 stars on yelp.&nbsp; The burgers look very big.&nbsp; I don&#039;t even think I could finish one of them.&nbsp; The menu looks very good.&nbsp; The only thing I don&#039;t like are the stools they have to sit on.&nbsp; They don&#039;t have any backs on them and look uncomfortable.&nbsp; They should get some regular chairs<br /><br />
