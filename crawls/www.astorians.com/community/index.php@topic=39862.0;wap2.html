			Take Root presents Kaoru Ikeda/MoustacheCat Dance and Xiang Xu Dance Theater <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;November 10 &amp; 11, 2017<br />&nbsp;8pm <br />&nbsp;Advance sale tickets: $15 online at www.GreenSpaceStudio.org<br />&nbsp;Tickets purchased at door: $20 cash, $22 credit card<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Kaoru Ikeda/MoustacheCat Dance’s Freedom isn’t Free addresses the prejudice that resulted in the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. The work continues to explore current biased reactions toward people of various races, religions, and ethnicities in the United States. Freedom isn’t Free is choreographed by Kaoru Ikeda and performed by Mutsuyo Issacs, Maho Takeshita, Sarah Bolander, and Kaoru Ikeda. Music is by Jónsi &amp; Alex (Licensed by BIM). An extended version of “Freedom isn’t Free” will be performed in May 2018 at University Settlement and has been funded in part by a grant from the Asian Women Giving Circle. <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Xiang Xu &amp; Hyung Ji Yu’s Oneness: The principle of the “oneness of life and its environment,” demonstrates that the causes of our joy and sorrow originate within us. It&#039;s difficult to believe in yourself because the idea of self is an artificial construction. You are, in fact, part of the glorious oneness of the universe. Everything around us, including work and family relationships, is the reflection of our inner lives. Everything is perceived through the self and alters according to the individual’s inner state of life.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Take Root is a monthly curated series that supports dance makers by providing an opportunity to show a half evening work paired with another artist.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Photo credits: George Hirose (MoustacheCat Dance) &amp; John Fleming (Xiang Xu/Arts NY Dance)
