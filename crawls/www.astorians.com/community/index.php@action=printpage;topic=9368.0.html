				Title: <strong>Save The Shea Stadium Home Run Apple</strong><br />

				There is currently an online petition and website to Save the Shea Stadium Home Run Apple when the Mets move to Citi Field. The mission of the website is simple:<br /><br /><em>the Apple must stay. When the Mets move into Citi Field in 2009, the Apple must move with them. We don&#039;t want to see a new Apple, an updated Apple, or a modernized Apple. We don&#039;t want to see a replica Apple. We don&#039;t even want to see a cleaned up and repaired Apple. We want to see the same lumpy, grimy, dented, beat up Apple that&#039;s been sitting behind the center field wall in Shea Stadium for 27 years. It may be an ugly 80&#039;s relic, but it&#039;s our ugly 80&#039;s relic, and we want it to stay.</em><br /><br />The petition reads:<br /><br /><em>To:&nbsp; Sterling Mets and Fred Wilpon<br /><br />We, the Undersigned, as fans of the New York Mets and Shea Stadium implore Sterling Mets and Fred Wilpon to Save the Home Run Apple which currently resides in Shea Stadium from being auctioned or sold. We ask that the Home Run Apple be moved to Citi Field after the end of the 2008 Season so that on Opening Day 2009, the same Home Run Apple that has been with the Mets since 1980 remains with the Mets in their new home. We ask that only the normal amount of maintenance be given to the Apple and a fresh coat of paint would also be fine, but the Apple should remain as it has since it&#039;s installation.<br /><br />We have come to countless games at Shea Stadium, we all have different memories, but one things remains the same for all Mets fans, and that is the thrill of seeing the Home Run Apple rise out of its top hat slowly after a Mets home run. A new apple will not be the same. What makes the Apple special is that it reminds Mets fans of their youth, of their past and the Mets&#039; past, of coming out to the ballpark and watching a game of baseball. We don&#039;t need any crazy gimmicks, shiny apples, bright lights, just a large red Apple coming out of a top hat. The same Apple that has come out of the same top hat for generations of Mets fans.<br /><br />We beg of you to Save the Apple and hope that you will take us seriously. </em><br /><br />Here are links to both:<br />http://www.savetheapple.com/index.php<br />http://www.petitiononline.com/nyapple/petition.html<br /><br />

				I&#039;m in, but also, do we know what is going to happen to all of those seats and other pieces of the park?&nbsp; I&#039;ve been loving and hating this team since the heady days of Lee Mazzilli, Craig Swan and Doug Flynn and I&#039;d want to be able to hold onto a little something.

				I heard&nbsp; Jeff Wilpon talk to the media yesterday about the apple and he was saying they don&#039;t know if it will be the same one or a new one, but they will definetely have one.&nbsp; Don&#039;t know if ESPN misheard him or he made the decision overnight.&nbsp; I hope it stays.
