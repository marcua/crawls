				I&#039;d like to start a thread about hate crimes, actions, or related behavior that you&#039;ve observed or heard about in your neighborhood. Anything that makes you feel unsafe.<br /><br /><br />Three people at the Q100 bus stop near PS 122 talking about Trump restoring &quot;core values&quot; after seeing young Latino boys play nearby.<br /><br /><br />A sign in a building calling for certain people to vacate, citing &quot;the time has come for good decent white people to take back our streets&quot; from a &quot;Proud American Voter, Trump 2016.&quot;<br /><br /><br />A van driving down 21st St. near Astoria Park with large Trump/Pence signs and flag (in the way some people parade the Confederate flag).

				We should be careful with this though. Driving down the road with the US flag and a Trump/Pence sign doesn&#039;t constitute hate and even less a crime. I would say that anyone reporting anything should both properly document it and possibly also report it to the authorities.<br /><br />We &#039;all&#039; have smartphones with cameras now, so taking pictures or filming is the way to go about it. Then we can post it.<br /><br />If we just ask for hear-say we risk making the situation far worse. There&#039;s already been one case with a woman unfortunately making up an event which just hurts everyone.

				I agree. Only the building sign in the instances above would be something reportable. However, there is a lot of behavior that falls in between that stems from the same hatred and I think should be acknowledged so other people can look out for it.<br /><br /><br />Regarding the van (it wasn&#039;t a U.S. flag but a Trump/Pence flag), it definitely made me feel unsafe so that&#039;s why I included it.

				Racism is obviously not cool but &quot;hate crimes&quot; are not going to increase because Trump was elected. That&#039;s ridiculous and fear-based. Racism sadly has always existed and the media and liberals who are upset about the election are making it look like any racist act is because of Trump. The truth is that racism has existed long before Trump and there is no uptick in racism because of Trump, despite what the media is telling you.<br /><br />Racism exists all over the city. I&#039;m a cyclist so people yell angry stuff at me all the time. I&#039;ve been called &quot;cracker&quot;, &quot;white trash&quot;, &quot;bitch&quot;, you name it. <br /><br />The media is reporting about racist graffiti yet fails to focus on stories like the white guy that was beaten by a group of black men because he supported Trump while onlookers yelled &quot;Don&#039;t vote trump&quot; or the high school student who was beaten up for supporting Trump. The violence goes both ways and liberals should hold their own accountable just as much as they look out for bias crimes.

That&#039;s terrible. You&#039;re right, racism exists, and it existed before this campaigning. Perhaps instead of being upset that non-whites are fearful of the future and want to shine a light on hate crimes you could see this as an opportunity for all of us to make everyone aware of ALL the hate crimes that are unacceptable, <strong>including what you experienced</strong>....?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=39581.msg256200.html#msg256200">Quote from: KellyO on November 13, 2016, 04:17:12 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The media is reporting about racist graffiti yet fails to focus on stories like the white guy that was beaten by a group of black men because he supported Trump while onlookers yelled &quot;Don&#039;t vote trump&quot; or the high school student who was beaten up for supporting Trump. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No, that&#039;s untrue.

The point is that Clinton didn&#039;t flirt with racist groups during the campaign. She didn&#039;t flirt with anti-white or anti-Christian sentiments to get votes, whereas Trump <em>did</em> do the the &#039;opposite&#039;. That&#039;s the difference.<br /><br />Yes, we&#039;ve had racism and hate crimes for a long, long time, but now we have an upcoming leader who has fueled those flames and that&#039;s something we haven&#039;t seen in quite some time. If you don&#039;t see the difference then I completely get why you don&#039;t understand the concern that some people now have.

We are talking about the US election. Also, if you dig deep at the studies on hate crimes post-Brexit you will see that they are flawed, complex, one-sided, and financed by liberal think tanks. If you look at the police reports that came out a week after Brexit you will see a rise in the number of reported hate crimes but not actual hate crimes. A crime isn&#039;t a crime if it&#039;s just reported. The police report said there was an uptick of reported hate crimes by 57% and they pulled all the data from this one source: http://www.report-it.org.uk/home (http://www.report-it.org.uk/home). </span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: verdana;" class="bbc_font">But, hate crimes have increased in the U.K. over the years since 1998 and there is a reason for it: the definition and scope &quot;hate crimes&quot; in the U.K. are constantly evolving. The government is investing millions into preventing hate crimes in churches and mosques and they recently added another couple million into punishing online &quot;trolling.&quot; In 1998, hate crimes were primarily defined by racial intolerance. In 2003, religious discrimination was added, gradually homophobic and transphobic crimes were added to the definition, and then crimes against the disabled and elderly. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: verdana;" class="bbc_font">So incidents and reports of hate crimes have increased primarily because the scope of the term &quot;hate crime&quot; has evolved. </span><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=39581.msg256203.html#msg256203">Quote from: mm on November 13, 2016, 04:57:11 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><span style="font-family: verdana;" class="bbc_font"><br />How do you know this?

Do you read Rolling Stone? MSNBC? They focus primarily on racist acts by supposed Trump supporters. Some of them are true, of course. Some of them are still being investigated. Some of them are lies. Like the Muslim female student at University of Louisiana who said she was assaulted by pro-Trump supporters. She admitted it was a lie. Or like the gay man who said he was beaten up in Santa Monica by Trump supporters. Completely misleading story that may not even be true. Like the story of the KKK rally by celebrating Trump supporters: total lie. It turns out it was an old picture. A nazi flag going up over someone&#039;s house: done by a liberal trying to make a political point. I swastika with &quot;trump&quot; written next to it on a storefront in Philly: police pictures show a black male doing this. The two students in the South wearing blackface to celebrate Trump&#039;s victory: total lie. They were wearing facial peels that happened to be colored black. <br /><br /><br />The list goes on and on. Yes, there are racists in America. Yes, some of them are Trump supporters. But there is certainly not an epidemic of hate crimes because of the Trump victory. That is irresponsible thinking and only increases paranoia and fear. Don&#039;t take the media at face value. Do your own research please!

				<br />Hard to say whether Hate Crimes have in fact &#039;increased&#039; since election, or whether this is hysteria/exaggeration perpetuated by liberal social media.&nbsp; But let&#039;s say for sake of argument that Hate Crimes have increased.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to think/hope that this is a short-lived thing stemming from an adrenaline rush by certain eggheads who also happened to vote from Trump, and who feel emboldened and who may also be responding to the backlash and protests by Hillary supporters.&nbsp; Let&#039;s face it...it was a very emotional election, and as Trump continues to flesh out his team and we are learning who is being appointed, there continues to be strong emotion, mainly from the Hillary supporters who are very unhappy.&nbsp; <br /><br />I was a Hillary supporter, as are most of my friends, and yet I actually had to sign-off of Facebook this past week, as the comments and behaviors of my friends on FB were truly making me insane.&nbsp; I saw many posts on FB by Clinton supporters, announcing that any of their friends who supported Trump should &#039;Unfriend&#039; them right now.&nbsp; I saw a comment that with Trump supporters feeling so emboldened, that they&#039;d &#039;not be surprised if some of the Trump supporters began &#039;raping and murdering Clinton supporters&#039;, and that &#039;Trump himself basically supports this thinking&#039;.&nbsp; Are you kidding me??!&nbsp; Talk like this is pure insanity.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sadly, I think many HC and many Trump supporters are two sides of the same coin, with neither group allowing for critical thinking, or considering all viewpoints.&nbsp; It seems many people simply ingest and then &#039;regurgitate&#039; that which is fed to them by their own camp.&nbsp; There is no middle ground anymore.&nbsp; No conversations.&nbsp; Just a lot of thinking that &#039;I and my tribe are always right&#039; and &#039;you and your camp are always wrong&#039;.&nbsp; <br /><br />Social media has only added to this problem.&nbsp; Stories and opinions are thrown out there on social media, people latch on to them, reactions are swift and knee-jerk, people add their own Comments, Share/Retweet, and it takes on a life of its own.&nbsp; Things spiral, and &#039;movements&#039; are created within mere minutes.&nbsp; Individuals&#039; lives and careers have been shattered within minutes, not necessarily due to the gravity of what any one person may have done or said, but moreso simply due to the inordinate power that we&#039;ve given social media.&nbsp; It&#039;s insane.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure I got why so many were protesting after Trump won.&nbsp; What was the point...to say that you&#039;re not happy he won?&nbsp; Duh.&nbsp; It happens every election.&nbsp; Someone must win.&nbsp; And someone must lose.&nbsp; I could have understood if folks had protested as soon as Trump became the Republican nominee.&nbsp; Perhaps folks should have protested then, that such a person should not even be allowed to be a candidate.&nbsp; But to protest after the election was all said and done?&nbsp; Pointless.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;d also heard it said that people were actually protesting the fact that Trump didn&#039;t win the popular vote.&nbsp; But again, if that were the true reason, then why haven&#039;t people been protesting prior to this, to get rid of the electoral college entirely?&nbsp; No, I think people were protesting simply because they were upset that Trump won.&nbsp; That, and the power of social media creating an emotional storm that they decided to become a part of.<br /><br />I plan to sit back and see how this unfolds, and then as Trump puts forth legislation, or turns back legislation, only then will I respond in kind and decide whether I am motivated to protest.&nbsp; But I&#039;m not going to protest simply because I don&#039;t like the candidate that won the election.<br /><br /><br />

				<br />Just watched the video.&nbsp; People like this have always existed (even in a place like NYC) and always will.&nbsp; The difference is that such people now feel that they can be a bit more vocal and not have to hide behind a mask...this because they think the bulk of the country (i.e., those that voted for Trump) support this behavior and thinking, or at the very least, will simply allow it to occur and they will just look the other way.&nbsp; But anyone with any sense, and that includes many Trump supporters, can recognize that that the guy behind the wheel is an idiot, pure and simple.&nbsp; <br /><br />That doesn&#039;t make it right, and I&#039;m sure it&#039;s unsettling if you are the recipient of such vitriol.&nbsp; I am very disheartened that...I think this is going to feel like a very looooonnnng four years.&nbsp; ;-(

				This happened near Astoria Kaufman on Saturday night. At least these guys don&#039;t bother hiding their faces or hats in addition to their idiocy?<br /><br /><br /><br />https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1154826607959219&amp;id=100002956718611<br /><br /><br />Also, beware that there is a guy who rants about anti-immigrant stuff in the area around 31st St. and Ditmars. He walks a chihuahua. The other day he was saying negative things about immigrants to the cashier (who seemed to be an immigrant?) at the grocery store next to Key Food.
