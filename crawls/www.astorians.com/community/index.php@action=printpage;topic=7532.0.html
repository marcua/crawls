				[fw]<br />&nbsp;<br />September 11, 2001, was a defining event in this country’s history and the building of a national tribute is a part of that story, signifying our response to the attacks. That is why it is important that every American takes part in building the National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum. We are building a national symbol that, like the Statue of Liberty, will tell us something about who we are as Americans. <br /><br />We are also launching a new website, http://www.national911memorial.org/, to help raise awareness about our national mission. The website will expand on our current site, building a global online community of people who are dedicated to helping build the Memorial &amp; Museum. The website will be a resource to explore the events of September 11, 2001, and February 26, 1993, and will allow the public to draw upon personal memories, sharing stories and photographs of their experiences. In the coming months, we will add a variety of new, interactive features to the website. <br />In order to help reach people across the country, we are bringing a September 11th tribute exhibition to towns and cities this fall to raise awareness and funds for the construction of this national tribute. The exhibition will tell the story of September 11th from the point of view of families, responders, survivors, volunteers and everyday people who came together in the aftermath of the attacks. We are inviting people from across the country to come together again to pay tribute to those who lost their lives on September 11th and asking people to sign a steel beam that will be used in the construction of the Memorial &amp; Museum.<br />We will launch the tour on September 10, 2007, in Columbia, South Carolina when we pick up steel beams from the fabrication plant. From Columbia, the exhibition will travel to the following cities:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Raleigh, NC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charleston, WV&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fort Wayne, IN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madison, WI&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Omaha, NE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Norfolk, VA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cincinnati, OH&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lansing, MI&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sioux Falls, SD&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wichita, KS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Pittsburgh, PA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lexington, KY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aurora, IL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Des Moines, IA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />This is only the beginning. As the tour progresses, we will post location details and announce additional tour stops on our website, www.national911memorial.org/btm_nationaltour<br />We hope you will join us at the exhibition and spread the word about this important effort to your family and friends. <br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Joe Daniels<br />President &amp; CEO<br />National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum at the World Trade Center<br /><br />One Liberty Plaza, 20th Floor, New York, NY 10006 ║p (212) 312-8800 ║f (212) 227-7931<br />http://www.national911memorial.org/<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />

				At the risk of being a negative-nod magnet here, I have to say I&#039;m more than a little weary of the horse-and-pony shows that seem to have dominated post-9/11 developments.<br /><br />One American trait that is sadly not as common as it used to be is frugality. Why we feel it necessary to spend nearly <em>$1 billion</em> on a what is really a national mausoleum is beyond me... I feel it&#039;s just a monument to this our latest grandiose national obsession. Like the faded and rusted memorials to the USS Maine, in 100, 200 years from now, what will it matter, except the pricetag?<br /><br />I&#039;m not callous to the horror and pain of that day. No one is. We&#039;ve all been affected by it, to whatever degree. Nor do I think we should scrap any plan to memorialize what happened. I just think a little more prudence and simplicity would better ensure that our collective memories don&#039;t get buried in a showcase of tragedy worship and gloomy pageantry. That&#039;s all.
