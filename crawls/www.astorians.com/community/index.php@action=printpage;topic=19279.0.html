				I&#039;ve run this thread before in various flavors - Levitz, El Mundo, etc.&nbsp; These were all stores you didn&#039;t mind locking their doors because the service had gotten abysmal.&nbsp; So I notice A&amp;P the current owners of Pathmark picked something like 10 stores to close around the tri-state.&nbsp; So why didn&#039;t they pick LIC Pathmark to close?&nbsp; The people at customer service must think it&#039;s already happened.&nbsp; Tell them the bottle machine bin is full on Labor Day, and the woman comes back saying that machine isn&#039;t open today.&nbsp; Hey, that machine that shouldn&#039;t be open was open when I walked past it.<br /><br />Can&#039;t believe I&#039;m saying it.&nbsp; I hope this Pathmark gets it in the next round of cuts.&nbsp; Because the staff there doesn&#039;t give a ....

				I think they&#039;ve been checked out for a few years, at least from my experience with the store.

				How&#039;s the near-by Stop &amp; Shop?&nbsp; I&#039;m not usually over there and I&#039;m thinking of making a special trip.

				I went to that Pathmark twice, and both times it was awful. Went on a Saturday morning both times, not the ideal time, but whatever...and they would have 1 or 2 lines open, that were about 20 carts deep. There were near riots, it was that bad. The prices were pretty good but the service was beyond abysmal. I actually took my discount card off my keychain the second time, and threw it out, and vowed to never go back, and I haven&#039;t. The Stop &amp; Shop there is pretty solid. I&#039;m a pretty big fan of Bravo International, however, that&#039;s my go to.

				Now this current week from Pathmark comes a two week circular.&nbsp; A) it was totally light on sale items.&nbsp; B) A sad money-saving move.&nbsp; Now I have no motivation to visit them in week #2.

				Story in The Star-Ledger saying Ailing A&amp;P to close 32 stores in six states, including at least 16 in N.J.&nbsp; Seven of those stores closed will be Pathmarks, labeling all these stores as underperforming.

				I&#039;ve been to Pathmark on Northern Blvd twice about 5 years ago and both times were disgusting. They cut my deli meats and cheeses with the plastic still on and I realized when I made a sandwich that I had to throw them both out. The floors are dirty and the people were rude. I never went back.
