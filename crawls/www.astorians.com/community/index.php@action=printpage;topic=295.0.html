				Has this happened to you? Your in a bar, on a train, somewhere, minding your business, and some one walks up to you asking your for your number? You turn around to see who asked and whish you had not, for that person is so unattractive and serial killer looking that you just want to dial 911 instead. Well try this! Next time someone is in the bar harassing you and wont let you go without giving them a number give them this one instead 248-262-6861. This number will work on anyone who you have no interest in having your real number. <br /><br />They will get a recording that goes something like this.....&quot;The person who gave you this number did not want you to have their real number. Maybe the idea of going out with you just seems as appealing as playing leapfrog with unicorns . ... Do your best to forget about the person who gave you this number because, trust us, they've already forgotten about you.&quot; <br /><br />It is real funny to listen to. Try it. Call it. I did. It is actually longer and funnier to use then the above. Now I have a new number to use. You can also visit http://www.rejectionhotline.com and get a more local number.
