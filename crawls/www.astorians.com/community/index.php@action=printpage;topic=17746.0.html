				<br /><br />http://www.gop.com/firepelosi/<br /><br />Looks like they are well past 400k<br /><br />This is in search of a new speaker.

It would be nice to see new leadership on all sides.<br /><br /><br />http://rothenbergpoliticalreport.blogspot.com/2010/03/for-democrats-this-isnt-simply-another.html<br /><br />I dont know how much of a bias there.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />&nbsp;Obama and the Democratic Congressional leadership have dug themselves into a deep and dangerous political hole, and the only question right now seems to be the severity of the drubbing.<br /><br />&nbsp;“All of the elements are in place for a disaster like 1994. But it could be even worse.”<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Currently Dems have over 250 seats.

So I don&#039;t think it&#039;s as big as a threat as it may seem now. I will be interested to see the trends over the next few weeks. <br /><br />The Rothenberg link listed pollsters I am unfamiliar with. Not saying they are wrong. Just saying I am not sure how much to believe.<br /><br />And God yes...anyone but Boehner! Unless it&#039;s Cantor.&nbsp; :-o

				Ha! It&#039;s up to 1.2 million now. Gotta admit, I&#039;m kinda impressed.<br /><br />As a correlation. DailyKos and others has raised 1.2 million for Bill Halter to Primary out Sen Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas. All in all should be an interesting November.

				Well, People love&nbsp; <em>free</em> stuff, so&nbsp; it may be less&nbsp; of a&nbsp; landslide, since&nbsp; Obama-care, now sadly the law of the land, will get benefits&nbsp; out before&nbsp; payment is due. Yes, soon we&#039;ll be as&nbsp; &#039;progressive&#039; as Europe and Greece, complete&nbsp; with riots&nbsp; for hanging out at cafe&#039;s&nbsp; 3/4 of the year.&nbsp; :wink:&nbsp; &nbsp;Still, I am glad many Americans have awakened&nbsp; to what&nbsp; I and others&nbsp; have been yelling about for&nbsp; years.
