			This is something I&#39;ve become more and more interested in. I&#39;ve started thinking about ways I can live more frugaly/simply, reduce the amount of trash I produce, and improve my environmental impact. I thought I&#39;d see if others are interested in dialogue. <br /><br />The Twin Cities Green Guide <br /><br />Green Map &quot;global eco-cultural movement, energized by local knowledge, action and responsibility.&quot;<br /><br />Green Apple Map<br /><br />Ethical Consumer UK magazine that publishes information on various companies and products. <br /><br />http://ethicalconsumerism.tribe.net/<br /><br />How To Compost<br /><br />Simplicity<br /><br />Simple Living

			Along the lines of this topic (and I hope I&#39;m not getting off-topic), does anyone know how/where I can recycle used plastic shopping bags?&nbsp; Can they go out with the rest of the recycling?&nbsp; It&#39;s not like we have that many, but I&#39;d like to recycle what we do have rather than throw them out with the trash.

			I don&#39;t think you can recycle them, though I could be wrong. <br /><br />I reuse mine to line wastebins. <br /><br />Cabanird once crocheted a tote bag out of them. <br /><br />The other thing is to take a backpack when you do your grocery shopping and ask them not to bag anything except meat. <br /><br />
