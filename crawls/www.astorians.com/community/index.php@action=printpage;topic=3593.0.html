				Architecture in Helsinki was in Central Park? Crap! I miss everything!<br /><br />I&#39;ve been battling a cold since Sunday, but I still went to see Flaming Lips on Monday. Of course, it was indoors, but that still didn&#39;t help. My cold got even worse after that. The plus side? Two days off of work without feeling too guilty.

				You know they changed the formula on the nighttime sniffling sneezing stuff, right?&nbsp; It&#039;s not so. . . nighttime as it was.&nbsp; However, someone I work with said just this afternoon that they still do make the original formula, but it&#039;s locked up with all the other &quot;dangerous&quot; drugs behind the counter now, and you have to ask the pharmacist for it and sign away your firstborn to get it.&nbsp; But at least it&#039;s available.<br /><br />Good luck -- and feel better!

				I&nbsp; was always&nbsp; very healthy, up until&nbsp; a few years&nbsp; ago, I successfully battled&nbsp; Cancer.&nbsp; It devastated&nbsp; me physically, financially, but, I fought back and am Cancer free. One thing I will&nbsp; say about the Hippie &#039;freaks&#039; when I used&nbsp; to be&nbsp; Pink Floyd head, I would often run into &#039;chicks&#039;, who had books&nbsp; about natural&nbsp; cures, long before&nbsp; that guy who sells&nbsp; that book on TV. It is true, you can naturally fight almost any disease and the best&nbsp; way is by trying not to get sick and build&nbsp; up your immunity.&nbsp; Stress&nbsp; is&nbsp; the number&nbsp; one contributor, along with lifestyle, smoking, drinking excessively, eating&nbsp; too much fat, salt, sugar, but, also exercise. You can&#039;t substitute exercise with anything. No pill, tonic or gimmick, you MUST&nbsp; exercise, even if you walk a&nbsp; mile&nbsp; a&nbsp; day. I jog 5 miles/5days&nbsp; a week and limit my food intake to two&nbsp; meals&nbsp; a day, the heaviest&nbsp; being&nbsp; afternoon.&nbsp; You will see how magically most &#039;allergic&#039; symptoms&nbsp; evaporate. I know&nbsp; people&nbsp; who eliminated/cured&nbsp; diabetes, cancer and in one&nbsp; case reversed&nbsp; the symptoms&nbsp; that&nbsp; were an onset&nbsp; of HIV&nbsp; leading&nbsp; to full blown AIDS. A very good&nbsp; friend of mine, who sadly passed on last&nbsp; year, fought HIV&nbsp; for years, diagnosed&nbsp; in 1987, but, kept&nbsp; the symptoms&nbsp; at&nbsp; bay for about 20 years.&nbsp; He died&nbsp; from a heart attack. Still, he lived far longer&nbsp; using these&nbsp; natural&nbsp; methods. Being ill is&nbsp; a challenge, but, what doesn&#039;t kill us&nbsp; makes&nbsp; us stronger, is often true, I&#039;m living proof.&nbsp; :-)
