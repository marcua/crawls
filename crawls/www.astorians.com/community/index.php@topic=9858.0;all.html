								<div class="inner" id="msg_118704">So, I was in a&nbsp; store&nbsp; yesterday, and the&nbsp; song by&nbsp; John Mayer.. Waiting For the World&nbsp; To Change.. this years&nbsp; &#039;Anti-War&#039; tune. Besides&nbsp; being a pretentious bore, it did remind me of the history&nbsp; of the Protest and Patriotic&nbsp; song. I guess the furthest back one can go, in the USA at least, would be Woody Guthrie. In my youth I found many of his songs&nbsp; inspiring and great, of course, at one time&nbsp; I watched&nbsp; Bozo and believed&nbsp; Spiderman was swinging through NYC. :lol: But, Woody, did have some great songs,best known for&nbsp; &#039;This Land Is Your&nbsp; Land&quot;, Woody&nbsp; was&nbsp; a great American folk singer. Later, I found out Woody used this as an alternative&nbsp; to Irving Berlins Flag-Waver &#039;God Bless America&#039;. He originally wanted to call the song &#039;God Blessed America.&quot;&nbsp; Now, Woody grew up at&nbsp; a&nbsp; time&nbsp; when Socialism and Communism had a &#039;human&#039; face still, and he did throw in, but, to his credit, was&nbsp; never&nbsp; a member of either. Actors&nbsp; like Will Greer, best known as Grandpa&nbsp; Walton on the Waltons, first introduced&nbsp; Woody to members of&nbsp; the Communist Party. Still, Woody Guthrie&nbsp; was not a&nbsp; &#039;joiner&#039;, more&nbsp; stalwart&nbsp; &#039;protest&#039; singers like&nbsp; Pete&nbsp; Seeger, who was an avowed Stalinist and&nbsp; who took 50 years after Stalins&nbsp; death to admit he was&nbsp; &#039;wrong&#039;, were much more&nbsp; than just fellow travelers. Woody was married&nbsp; three times and fathered&nbsp; 8 kids, Arlo his son, was most famous&nbsp; in the late 60&#039;s&nbsp; with Alices&nbsp; Restaurant, but, no way as talented as Woody. Woody died&nbsp; of&nbsp; Huntingtons&nbsp; disease.He carried&nbsp; with him a guitar, from the Dustball Era of the 30&#039;s, which had&nbsp; a&nbsp; sticker &#039;This Guitar&nbsp; Kills&nbsp; Fascists&#039;, unfortunately, Woody himself did not want to actually&nbsp; kill Fascists, as he avoided&nbsp; being drafted&nbsp; during&nbsp; WW 2, cause he thought he could do more&nbsp; harm against them at home by writing songs?&nbsp; <img src="http://www.astorians.com/community/Smileys/SoLoSMiLeYS1/wink.gif" alt="&#58;wink&#58;" title="wink" class="smiley" />&nbsp; Eventually, he joined the Merchant Marine, but, was bounced&nbsp; into the Army, oddly enough the Army&nbsp; was OK with him being associated&nbsp; with Communists, and the Merchant Marine&nbsp; was not, go figure?&nbsp; :lol: <br /><br />Although, the 50&#039;s&nbsp; are many times&nbsp; associated&nbsp; with &#039;repression&#039;&nbsp; of Folk Singers with &#039;left&#039;&nbsp; leanings, it was only early in the 1950&#039;s, with the Iron Curtain descending in Eastern Europe&nbsp; and&nbsp; the crimes&nbsp; of &#039;Uncle&#039; Joe&nbsp; Stalin came to light, that many proud, &#039;liberal/progressive&#039; Folks&nbsp; began to distance themselves from the Communist Party. Woody was not one of&nbsp; them, he continued&nbsp; on till his death sadly in the late 60&#039;s. I consider Woody, even though&nbsp; I vehemently disagree with his support of Communists, the&nbsp; quintessential&nbsp; &#039;Protest&#039; singer/writer.<br /><br />Fast foward&nbsp; to the&nbsp; late 60&#039;s, Country Joe and&nbsp; the Fish, &quot;I Feel Like I&#039;m Fix&#039;n To Die Rag.&#039;&nbsp; In response&nbsp; to the&nbsp; lingering Vietnam conflict, many&nbsp; songs of protest emerged, but, unlike&nbsp; WW 2, or even the early Cold&nbsp; War, when many actors, singers&nbsp; also&nbsp; supported&nbsp; the conflicts in song and movie, Vietnam spawned&nbsp; louder and more angry protest songs. This song by&nbsp; Country Joe and the Fish, to me, epitimised one of them. Although, the&nbsp; &#039;Whoppee&nbsp; We&#039;re&nbsp; All Gonna Die&quot; ending added&nbsp; a Carnival like&nbsp; atmosphere&nbsp; to a deadly serious&nbsp; War. Still,&nbsp; there&nbsp; were&nbsp; songs&nbsp; and movies&nbsp; supportive, like John Waynes &#039;Green Berets&#039; and the song &quot;Ballads&nbsp; Of The Green Berets.&quot;&nbsp; The song was written by Robin Moore and Staff Sgt. Barry Sadler, while the latter was recuperating from a leg wound suffered as a medic in the Vietnam War. Moore also wrote a non-fiction book, The Green Berets, about the force. Contrary to popular&nbsp; belief, many were&nbsp; supportive of the Vietnam Conflict, at least the first few years. <br /><br />Certainly, John Lennon, after leaving&nbsp; The Beatles, wore&nbsp; some of&nbsp; his politics&nbsp; on his sleeve, but, even he would admit&nbsp; that Instant Karma&nbsp; and Imagine&nbsp; are notable&nbsp; exceptions&nbsp; and one can say it was more his inflated ego&nbsp; on display than any serious&nbsp; song&nbsp; on a better&nbsp; world. Sadly, John should have been more careful, used to see him quite&nbsp; a&nbsp; bit&nbsp; when I was a kid, even shook his hand once. <br /><br />As the Vietnam Conflict faded, so did the Protest song, and Patriotic&nbsp; songs slowly&nbsp; started&nbsp; making a&nbsp; comeback, not seen since&nbsp; the early 60&#039;s. The Hostage&nbsp; crisis&nbsp; ending in Iran ,with release of the hostages, after 444 days, made the song &#039;Tie&nbsp; A&nbsp; Yellow&nbsp; Ribbon&#039; by Tony Orlando And&nbsp; Dawn a hit.&nbsp; The song was&nbsp; really about a convict let free, but was soon used by folks&nbsp; tired&nbsp; of the USA&nbsp; being run down&nbsp; and attacked, and they tied&nbsp; yellow ribbons as&nbsp; a show&nbsp; of solidarity for the hostages. <br /><br />Over the years Country music&nbsp; has always&nbsp; been a mainstay of Patriotic songs, whereas&nbsp; &#039;Rock&#039; was always&nbsp; considered more &#039;protest&#039; music&nbsp; of the &#039;system.&#039; Although, this is far from the case. Many a&nbsp; &#039;Metal&#039; show, particularly&nbsp; bands&nbsp; like&nbsp; MANOWAR, or even the more&nbsp; recent&nbsp; METALLICA and THREE DOORS&nbsp; DOWN, have issued&nbsp; records&nbsp; songs supportive of the armed&nbsp; forces&nbsp; in combat. An exception to Country music was a band like&nbsp; the Dixie Chicks, who seemed&nbsp; to ride&nbsp; a wave of discontent, but, as many of&nbsp; the &#039;protest&#039; songs artists discover, most end&nbsp; in obscurity or&nbsp; a footnote&nbsp; in history. Which brings&nbsp; me to this song.<br /><br />I never&nbsp; heard of John Mayer, and this&nbsp; song is&nbsp; pretty tepid and not much of&nbsp; a &#039;protest&#039;.. waiting for the world&nbsp; to change?&#039; Hmm, let&#039;s&nbsp; wait for&nbsp; the leaves&nbsp; to change?&nbsp; :lol:&nbsp; Pretty bad, what&#039;s&nbsp; most disturbing about this era is&nbsp; not&nbsp; the plethora&nbsp; of protest songs and films, which I mostly detest, and find&nbsp; terribly narrow minded and full of self&nbsp; importance, but, the lack of&nbsp; real movies and music supportive of say the Troops&nbsp; in Afghan and the&nbsp; War on those&nbsp; who attacked us. <br /><br />In spite&nbsp; of the characterisations by some of my posts and thoughts here, I don&#039;t want to eliminate&nbsp; anyone&nbsp; from speaking&nbsp; or&nbsp; singing, writing or running down nude&nbsp; in the middle of Times&nbsp; Square, OK, maybe&nbsp; if the look good on the latter.&nbsp; :lol:&nbsp; No, citizen soldiers&nbsp; should&nbsp; speak up, but, do no harm to what is good. The culture&nbsp; seems&nbsp; so&nbsp; one-sided&nbsp; today&nbsp; as it is stifling. Everywhere&nbsp; I go I am greeted&nbsp; with one version of the days events&nbsp; in one of the largest Cities in the nation. If I dare to criticise, I am attacked, a mob mentality ensues. In days&nbsp; past, alot&nbsp; of things were in the American Mix. Woody Guthrie was around the time&nbsp; of the Andrew Sisters and&nbsp; a&nbsp; Hollywood highly supportive&nbsp; of that conflict. In the 50&#039;s, falsely characterised&nbsp; as&nbsp; this blanket repressive time was&nbsp; when Rock N&#039;Roll&nbsp; took off and films abounded&nbsp; pushing the envelope. The conflicting sides came to head&nbsp; in the late 60&#039;s, but, even as&nbsp; rioting broke out in the streets&nbsp; of Chicago&nbsp; and a&nbsp; whole generation lost their direction in Upstate&nbsp; NY at&nbsp; WoodStock, US&nbsp; Astronauts&nbsp; landed&nbsp; on the Moon and planted&nbsp; the stars&nbsp; and stripes. 70&#039;s&nbsp; Chaos and the reality that&nbsp; the Woodstock generation was also&nbsp; Charlie&nbsp; Mansons soon had&nbsp; further&nbsp; blows when&nbsp; &#039;Free&#039; Love&nbsp; spawned an explosion of unwanted children and eventually&nbsp; the tragedy&nbsp; of AIDS of the&nbsp; mid-80&#039;s. Still, the long gas lines&nbsp; and hostage crisis led me and others who wanted to see the best&nbsp; for&nbsp; the nation turn from&nbsp; the late 70&#039;s&nbsp; down turn to the optimistic&nbsp; &#039;Reagan Era.&#039;&nbsp; The 80&#039;s&nbsp; were mostly a happy time&nbsp; for this&nbsp; nation, although the Cold War conflict provided&nbsp; some drama. The removal of Saddam from Kuwait in 1991 provided&nbsp; a perfect cap, with an almost WW 2 patriotism. The&nbsp; Iron Curtain finally came down at the end of&nbsp; that era&nbsp; and by 1992, we became so comfortable, that&nbsp; we had forgotten that enemies&nbsp; of&nbsp; freedom still lurked&nbsp; out there, the WTC bombing in 1993 for&nbsp; example. Saddam would torment&nbsp; our pilots, his people&nbsp; for another decade, and the attacks from Al Qeada would increase, culminating&nbsp; with 9/11. The enemies of Freedom. Woody Guthries&nbsp; Freedom, to&nbsp; John Waynes Freedom to your Freedom and mine, is not a&nbsp; Freedom to be&nbsp; taken lightly, nor does it mean we all have to agree on everything. But, no matter&nbsp; what side you are on, in the end it was all happening here, the good Ole&#039; USA. <br /><br /></div>

I managed the overnight programming for a radio station when I was in Boston. On Fridays and Saturdays when I DJ&#039;d, I played punk rock, rockabilly, psychobilly and horror rock. It was great. I never liked the Sex Pistols. Ian and his ripping off of the Dead Boys, Iggy and MC5 always got to me. Personally, I&#039;ve always been really into rockabilly and &#039;77Oi! stuff, but lately I&#039;ve been getting into some more psychobilly. It&#039;s great to hear bands like Angry Johnny and the Killbillies who blend punk and country ballads together. A punk band with an actually good guitarist?!? Be still my heart!<br /><br />Angry Johnny actually plays at the Rodeo Bar pretty regularly and being a redneck myself, I love that place. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=9858.msg118874#msg118874">Quote from: FZ on March 19, 2008, 09:27:22 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">A few years later I was in the NAVY, listening to my &#039;dad&#039;s music and appreciating American standards&nbsp; like&nbsp; Glen Miller&nbsp; and Sinatra.

Mostly into the New Orleans funky-bluesy stuff, but I also really like pianists like Chick and Bud Powell.

It&#039;s amazing how your taste changes and yet, how lots of stuff you listen to you&#039;ll always listen to. I grew up with Frank Zappa, the Beatles, Appalachia music and lots of weird jazz (like Anthony Braxton and Sun Ra) and I&#039;ll always love that stuff, but right now I&#039;m also getting into afrobeat music and more bluegrass. It&#039;s great to have a diversity of tastes and be able to appreciate musicianship across diferent genres.</div>

That&#039;s what a lot of rock/punk/hip-hop/whatever else &quot;rebellion&quot; is. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s necessarily thinking old folks are narrow minded, but more that they&#039;re stuck in old ways. <br />I&#039;m sure when you were a kid rocking out to whatever happened to be in your stereo at the time, you were probably resenting many older folks&#039; inability to keep up with modern times. <br /><br />As for the OP, certainly not one of his better songs, but listen to the rest of the Album if you like blues/jazz type stuff, it&#039;s overall a great album. He&#039;s an incredibly talented guitarist and composer, his proper music training is very apparent. <br /><br />As for the protest songs you mentioned, I think they&#039;re just as narrow-minded as ones that support the war, they&#039;re all just opinions. Narrow-minded means of a single view, and if the purpose of a song is specifically to support or denounce the war, of course it will come off as narrow-minded.</div>

He sold out and put out some cheesy sellout super pop-friendly albums at first, gained fans and credibility, and immediately followed by some more musically credible work. <br />Leave aside your experiences of him from prior albums/songs and pick up &quot;Continuum&quot;.

								<div class="inner" id="msg_119363">AlexNYC--yeah, I&#039;m just not impressed by the song. Oh well, to each their own.<br /><br />Also, Bruce has been pretty political since his career started, though my favorite stuff of his was always the more subtle stuff based in narrative that he did with the E Street Band.<br /><br />Songs as protest or as inspiration to revolution are ingrained in the innate consciousness, or so it seems. It&#039;s been part of our social interactions for a long time. I think one of the most compelling stories comes from Africa with Fela Kuti and his group&#039;s ability to inspire people against apartheid.<br /></div>

They understood that&nbsp; this was&nbsp; the start of&nbsp; a Jihad.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think we should&nbsp; be&nbsp; involved&nbsp; in the world, as the rise of&nbsp; totalitarian Govts. whether you trade with them, appease them for financial gain, always turn to tragedy. It&#039;s&nbsp; not a just&nbsp; a&nbsp; matter of&nbsp; disagreement of the same goals, but, a radically&nbsp; different world if the US did&nbsp; not &#039;interfere&#039; in moany cases. </div>
