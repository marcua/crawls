				Of all the major chain grocery stores near where I live, for a long time there was only one that sold chocolate yogurt.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think buyers of that product are a niche market, other than people who are willing to pay a lot for a little container of yogurt, but grocery stores will stock different branches of their stores with different items depending on their perception of the population.&nbsp; The Trade Fair across the street from me typically sells only <em>one </em>Phillips frozen seafood product at a time.&nbsp; Over the years they&#039;ve sold a variety of Phillips products, but only one product at a time.&nbsp; So, they believe there are people around here will pay a lot for a little seafood but they don&#039;t believe there are people around here who will buy more than one variety of it?&nbsp; I found Droste cocoa powder in a Manhattan chain grocery store when I wasn&#039;t even looking for it, and there were plenty of boxes on the shelf, but around here not one major supermarket carries it.&nbsp; And I bought a can of Bar Harbor overpriced Lobster Corn Chowder and a soft-pack container of Campbell&#039;s Thai Tomato Coconut Gourmet Bisque at Waldbaums in Bayside, but are there any chain grocery stores in this neighborhood that carry either?<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m not advocating all the products I&#039;ve mentioned.&nbsp; Some, the Droste cocoa and the Campbell&#039;s Thai soup are very good, but when you want to go a little crazy in the grocery store aisles, isn&#039;t there a regular grocery store around here that sells all these things?

				Key Food has definitely stepped up its game when it comes to &quot;gourmet&quot; and organic foods.&nbsp; Try the branch on 30th Avenue and 33rd Street.&nbsp; C-Town is getting into the act as well.&nbsp; Of course, there&#039;s also Green Bay Marketplace on Broadway between 32nd and 33rd--the Whole Foods of Astoria.
