				Just spotted a new Thai place, not yet open, across from Zorbas on 23rd Ave between 31st &amp; 29th.<br /><br />Called &quot;bangkok thai&quot; or something like that.&nbsp; Big orange awning.&nbsp; I expect it&#39;ll be takeout/delivery.&nbsp; It is in the same spot as a chinese food place used to be (but apparently isn&#39;t anymore -- I never noticed it being gone).<br /><br />If we just had some indian food -- all would be right with the world.&nbsp; (Meghna/Ghandi are great but the delivery takes fooooorever).

				This place is open now -- menu prices are $2 or so cheaper than wave with more seafood options -- and lunch specials.&nbsp; Fewer veggie options (no fake duck/tofu).<br /><br />I haven&#39;t tried it though.<br /><br />I just think thai and then think wave and go with what I know.

				I don&#39;t know -- those hole-in-the-wall takout places give me the willies. I don&#39;t trust &#39;em, but I&#39;d be willing to take on the good authority (and courage) of some brave soul...

				I&#39;m a little nervous so it might not be me.<br /><br />Maybe in a few weeks... give them a chance to cook a bit before I try.

				I ate there yesterday and loved it.&nbsp; The menu had so much to choose from I couldn&#39;t decide what to order and the prices were great.&nbsp; I tried a sauteed dish with chicken that was spicy.&nbsp; I really enjoyed it and felt that I got my money&#39;s worth.&nbsp; They had lots of vegetarian dishes on the menu.&nbsp; I&#39;m defnitely planning on going back there and highly recommend it.

				Yes, I&#39;m still alive.&nbsp; Sometimes these small, unfancy places are better than the places with higher prices and lots of atmosphere.&nbsp; Before this I used to go to Yajai Thai on 30th Avenue.&nbsp; Of all the Thai restaurants on 30th Avenue, that one is the least fancy, but in my opinion, it has the best food.&nbsp; I went to Wave Thai when they opened and wasn&#39;t impressed.&nbsp; I got the lunch special shrimp with curry and got a tiny bowl of curry with 4 shrimp.&nbsp; I was still hungry when I finished eating.&nbsp; This places gives a good size portion and the food was delicious.&nbsp; I can&#39;t wait to go back and try something else.&nbsp; I recommend that you try it and don&#39;t judge it by the way it looks. :-)

				You should consider going back to Wave.&nbsp; They&#39;ve really improved a lot sense they first opened.&nbsp; Last time I went there, I was stuffed.&nbsp; And we didnt&#39; spend that much.

				I did find the vegetarian section of their menu enticing.&nbsp; I&#39;ll have to try the new place given the glowing recommendation!<br /><br />Thanks for trying it out braun.<br /><br />cheers,<br />jayme

				Maybe I&#39;ll give Wave another chance, but this place has a bigger menu and cheaper prices and I felt comfortable going there by myself. 8-)

				I ate at Wave Thai a couple weeks ago, and the portions were big.&nbsp; Pretty good stuff.&nbsp; <br /><br />I tried Bankok Tasty the other day, and it was great as well.&nbsp; My roommate tells me that Ubols(?) on Steinway is pretty good too.&nbsp; Looks like we have alot of great options for Thai food in our neck of the woods these days.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				I never went to Ubols, but heard that it was really good.&nbsp; I&#39;m just so glad that these places opened around Ditmars.&nbsp; Thai food is one of my favorite kinds of food to eat out because it it so different and so tasty.&nbsp; I hardly ever eat Chinese food anymore.

				I&#39;m a convert to Bangkok Tasty.&nbsp; I&#39;m not even a Thai food fan, but I&#39;ve gotten hooked on the pad med ma muang over the past two weeks.&nbsp; Fantastic!!!!!!<br /><br />I was never that impressed with Ubol&#39;s.&nbsp; I have yet to try Wave.

				I have a feeling that Bangkok Tasty is going to expand. I was eating in there the other day and the owner was talking to some other people in his language, but they went outside and were looking at this store that was for rent next store.&nbsp; Only time will tell.&nbsp; Maybe they want to make it into a regular restaurant.
