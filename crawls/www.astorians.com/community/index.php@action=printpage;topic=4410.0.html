				Okay. So I&#039;ve found a few Astorian places that aren&#039;t too out of the way to be good venues to get a decent selection of beer on draft...<br /><br />But where the *&amp;$%@&amp;*+^ do I go to get beer by the 12er or the case that isn&#039;t your garden variety supermarket/c-store beer? I&#039;m talking Belgians, Germans, some strange microbrews I don&#039;t know. Is there anywhere in the neighborhood or if not in Astoria, can anyone recommend somewhere a short subway ride away where I could get my heart&#039;s content?<br /><br />And please don&#039;t say Trader Joes in Union Square. The selection there is sad and the lines too too long.<br /><br />Thank you, in advance, and I would also like to, in advance, invite those who recommend places over for a good beer sometime.

				Best Yet Market has a very good selection including Majic Hat, Blue Moon, LI Blue Point (Toasted Lagers are great) as well as imports.<br />Almost every Key Food has Franzeskaner Hefer Weiss. And of course (Support your local Brewery) Brooklyn Beers all of which are great. BTW I recommend visiting the Brewery . <br /><br />Lucky Beverage on 21 St off 30th Ave has probably the best selection of International&#39;s including Chimay and Duvel and many too numerous to mention - along with micro brews and exotics that seem never ending. <br /><br />The Beer Garden of course has a great selection going out for bars and stuff. SUnswick on 35th Ave near the Studios has something like 64 beers on draft. &nbsp;Hellgate Social has an excellent menu of beers for your indulgence at reasonable prices.<br /><br />I&#39;m something of a conneuesior, feel free to contact me for more info, but this is a good start.<br />

				Trade Fair also has a good selection of beers. They carry a lot of imports. Not so much in 12-packs, but a lot of bottles. There are some serious beer distributors outside of Queens if you look. This site lists some: http://www.ratebeer.com/Places/ShowTour.asp?TourID=14<br />But if you want to stay in the area, Trade Fair is surprisingly pretty interesting for beer selection.

				There is an earlier thread too on beer in Astoria -- perhaps a few -- but Heliopolis Deli is the best.<br /><br />http://astorians.com/index.php?topic=4160.0<br /><br />They don&#39;t though have 12 packs, if I remember right.&nbsp; All bottles are sold in 6 or individually so you can mix and match.&nbsp; A more expensive way to buy beer but good.<br /><br />Key Food also has some good stuff -- the better also only in 6 packs.&nbsp; Dog Fish Head.<br /><br />

				Thanks for all the recs.<br /><br />I haven&#39;t had such a hard time finding bars with good selection. At first, that was hard, but I&#39;ve found a bunch I like. I just like to enjoy beer at home and the supermarket selection here sucks.<br /><br />Trade Fair and Key Foods really don&#39;t have much in the way of anything interesting. They have all the standards, but nothing like what I&#39;m looking for.<br /><br />Where is Heliopolis?<br /><br />I&#39;m looking into the ratebeer site and hoping to check out some of those places.<br /><br />I guess what I miss most is that the last place I lived there were two liquor stores with really great selections of really reasonably prices twelve pack mixes from all different kinds of breweries. Some micro, some large, some international. I used to get a different one every week and now it&#39;s sad to me that a six of Becks or Negro Modela is the most exotic beer I&#39;ve found. Maybe it&#39;s the Grand Ave area, but where is my Smuttynose? Allagash? Shipyard? Chimay? Unibroque? Berkshire?<br /><br />Bueller? Bueller? <br /><br />Ha ha. PS-I am eager to get to the Beer Garden the store and see what I can find there. I think I will try to figure out the best route there tomorrow.<br /><br />And thanks again for all the advice, guys!

				Which Key Food are you referring to?&nbsp; The Key Food on 31st near Ditmars has much more than Becks or Negra Modelo (although they do have both of those).&nbsp; Most of the beer is in 6-packs rather than 12, it&#39;s true, but there&#39;s a pretty decent selection of, as you describe, &quot;some micro, some large, some international.&quot;&nbsp; I&#39;d say on balance they are stronger in microbrews and weaker in international, but do have some.&nbsp; The better ones are not in the cold section, but next to it.

				Okay, so I finally found Heliopolis (actually thanks to the brunch thread, I ended up walking down Broadway) and when I saw the beer there, I rejoiced. It&#39;s not as big or as cheap as I would like, but the selection is great and the guy there working with the beer obviously is down. He was great to talk to and I really love that place.<br /><br />The Trade Fair on 30th ave by the subway has a pretty boring selection of beer. I mean, they have St. Pauli Girl and they have all the Brooklyn beers--but there really isn&#39;t anything there that&#39;s Belgian style beyond Blue Moon (which is a good standby, but not my favorite beer). <br /><br />The Key food on 30th ave seems to be hit or miss. I went in there once and they didn&#39;t have much at all, but yesterday, they did have Fin du Monde, which was nice to see. <br /><br />I am really happy with Heliopolis. They don&#39;t have Shipyard or Berkshire, but they do have a lot of other similar mircobrews and also stuff I haven&#39;t tried. The guy there knew Berkshire, but apparently they don&#39;t send beer out of Massachusettes, so I won&#39;t find it anywhere anyway.<br /><br />Also, just so everyone knows, right near Hellsgate Social, there is a more beer distributor type place on 21st around 28th Ave, south of the 99 cent store. They have a really respectable selection and sell almost everything in twelves or cases for really great prices. All their stuff is really well-priced and probably the most bang for your buck that I&#39;ve found as far as beer in New York. They have lots of imports, but not so much in the microbreweries, though they do have a couple of staples (like Magic Hat mixers, but I&#39;m not that crazy about Magic Hat).<br /><br />Thanks everyone!

				I&#39;ve been following this thread with interest (it&#39;s beer, enough said).&nbsp; I seem to recall a small place on 30th Ave on the side of the street closer to Broadway, in between Steinway and the subway tracks, that had a really eclectic selection of beers sold by the bottle.&nbsp; I think someone may have made a reference to it already.&nbsp; Wish I knew the name but I remember being really impressed and surprised when I walked in and saw what was there.<br /><br />But my main reason for posting:&nbsp; I am from Western Mass and the only time I can get Berkshire Brewing Co. beer is when I go home and stock up.&nbsp; Is there a place anywhere in the city that sells it (on draft, in the bottle) that I&#39;m not aware of?&nbsp; This would be really wonderful to know about.&nbsp; From what my dad said they don&#39;t have much of an interest in exporting it outside the state.<br /><br />I second the recommendation about visiting the Brooklyn Brewing Co. in person.&nbsp; The last time I was there they were pouring some oatmeal stout not for sale on the market that just about made me do cartwheels.<br /><br />&nbsp;:-)

				Ok, I was just in Boston over the weekend and I couldn&#39;t count high enough to keep track of all the anti-yankee shirts I saw there.&nbsp; (i.e. &quot;My two favorite teams are the Red Sox and whoever beats New York&quot;).&nbsp; And they go on and on about this huge rivalry... but does anyone in NY really care about the Yankees playing the Red Sox?&nbsp; Is this just a one-sided rivalry that I didn&#39;t get the memo for?&nbsp; I don&#39;t get it.&nbsp; My whole life growing up in NY, who even knew who the Red Sox were and now this.&nbsp; <br /><br />And yes there are bars for you red sox fans, downtown in the village around W. 4th &amp; 7th I passed it one year during the playoffs.&nbsp; I&#39;ve never seen so much red in my life.&nbsp; And boy were they ugly looking&nbsp; :-D<br /><br /><br />Anyone spot Paulaner Hefeweizen around these parts of town?

				It&#39;s not one sided but we don&#39;t run around with stupid tshirts declaring it.&nbsp; But go to any Yankee Red Sox game, and you&#39;ll witness so many fights.&nbsp; On both sides.&nbsp; Turned me off, how stupid and immature it all was.<br /><br />But I&#39;m a Mets fan anyway.

				I agree that the anti-Yank merch is stupid, just like the anti-Sox merch is stupid. There are several t-shirts that show pictures of all the Yankee trophys and then next to it show the Boston ones. Whatever. <br /><br />I think it&#39;s a good, fun rivalry. Yankee/Red Sox games are always the most fun to watch. Both teams play hard and the fans love it.<br /><br />Just realize that there are two sides to the fans. Some people take it too far and some people make it a good time. An asshole is an asshole is an asshole. The guy who starts a fight because of a baseball game is a jerk, no matter what the team.<br /><br />And I&#39;m anti-jerk. As much as I&#39;ll joke about rooting for any team that beats the Yanks, I&#39;d rather watch a game with a good-natured Yankee fan that can take a joke than the kind of Red Sox fan that would wear the stupid anti-Yank s___ and start a fight. <br /><br />Anyway, points are:<br /><br />1. Red Sox fan does not equal hateful jerk.<br /><br />2. There are a lot of fine Sox fans in Boston, but I can&#39;t defend the ones at that bar. The red, however, does not surprise me.

				The best deal is a 24 pack of yuengling bottles at Costco for $14<br /><br />Its perfect for parties and gathering, because no one sells anything good around here in anything but six packs. The six pack is good for a personal stash, but those of us who can pound 12 on a friday or saturday need a little more on hand!<br /><br />Cheers!<br /><br />P.S. - also check out the wine and liquor section for some really good deals and I&#039;m not sure but they never check the membership cards for the liquor store part!

				Hah! Sorry for the grand, sweeping generalizations there...<br /><br />I guess for me that if I&#039;m looking for social stuff, I don&#039;t just go to a bar, I like to find events and such things. If I&#039;m in a place because it&#039;s a bar, though, they always have to have stuff on tap. Like when I go to the Hell Gate Social, I go there because they&#039;re playing Rocky Horror or there&#039;s a band. I don&#039;t go because of the bar factor, because, to me, no taps=not a place I go to without other enticement.<br /><br />Also, I find that some of the smaller bars I&#039;ve discovered in NYC with great taps also attract a really interesting group of people. I think it takes a little something strange to really go out of your way to find beer on tap, and I tend to really like those people!

The smell will vary depending on the type of beer you are making since the ingredients are different with each style: one variety of hops vs. another; one variety of yeast etc... Also, the length of fermentation (one week or two, for example) will determine how long you will be living with a beer-making odor. I would say that a traditional pale ale using an American hops, such as Cascade, will fill your house with a floral, somewhat malty, bouquet on your cooking day. Then, for about a week during fermentation you&#039;ll get a slightly yeasty odor similar to rising dough, but still with hints of the hops and malt. This scent is stronger for the first few days because that&#039;s when the yeast is going nuts. It calms down after that until the end of your fermentation cycle. Once you bottle the beer it&#039;s a moot point. Mind you, it will not smell like your local pub. That&#039;s rancid beer that&#039;s spilled and gone bad (not to mention the other smells that might be mixed in). Describe it more like cooking or even baking and it might be easier to sell to your wife. I used to brew all the time in a tiny, one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan. It was fine. Cheers!

				Thanks for the Dale&#039;s tip.&nbsp; I meant to mention another fantastic beer mecca, the Mark Bar, on Greenpoint Ave. near Eagle St. in Brooklyn.&nbsp; Just a stone&#039;s throw across the Gowanus Canal, this bar, to me, eclipses Spuyten Duyvil as it is always moderately priced and has a rotating draft selection of about 15 Euro and craft beers, (and not a Bud in sight!) It is super easy to take the G train to Greenpoint Ave. stop and is well worth the trip. They let you sample to your heart&#039;s content and seem to really respect the hops experience.&nbsp; Try it!

				megc-<br /><br />Saison duPont is one of my top ten beers, for sure. It&#039;s a French farmhouse ale and was rated the Best Beer in the World by Men&#039;s Journal sometime in 2005(? maybe &#039;06..). <br /><br />It&#039;s a golden, crisp ale. Heartier than a Chimay (IMHO), with a good color and nice fragrant smell to it that contrasts with the smooth taste. I&#039;m a big fan and it&#039;s definitely in the spirit of the Belgians, but hails from a lineage of ales made in barns for farmhands in Northern France. It&#039;s a pretty good tradition to hail from, methinks. There are some who say that the same qualities that provided good grape yeilds in the area influence the natural ingridients in the beer.<br /><br />Basically: It&#039;s damn good!&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				I love the Amber, too. A good session beer on a steamy, hot NOLA afternoon. A friend of mine worked at the brewery when they were first starting out. They rarely had enough money to pay everyone what they were worth, so the bosses would give each employee two cases of which ever beer they wanted and instructed them to drink it or sell it. I believe the staff still gets a beer allowance, though I&#039;m not sure how generous it is these days...

				Most smaller breweries do similar things.

				OK I know u want to browse through a supermarket but you and any other beer lover should check out a new spot in Astoria. Its a wine and beer bar on 35th Avenue and 30th Street called Rest-au-Rant. They just opened and they have a great selection of drafts and bottles. Things like Delirium Tremens on draft or Konings Hoeven in bottle. I&#039;m a wine drinker and the wine list is also really nice plus the bartender said they will keep adding more on over time.

				I have had success in the past in contacting a beer company directly to see who carries their product locally, so you may want to try that.&nbsp; Best Yet Supermarket @ 37th St bet. 20/19th Avs and Trade Fair @ 37th and Ditmars still carry a wide variety of beer.&nbsp; Best yet has a lot of American microbrews, while Trade Fair has a big European selection.&nbsp; Good luck in your quest!<br />And I would second Sparrow as having a nice selection.&nbsp; Bottled beer doesn&#039;t negate quality or taste.&nbsp; I find Dale&#039;s Pale Ale to be one of the best beers I have ever tasted and it comes in a can, on purpose, says the manufacturer.

				This is so not going to help anyone who doesn&#039;t have a car, but the Trader Joe&#039;s on Metropolitan has a great beer selection...lambics, Chimay, chocolate stouts, plus Guinness and some of the other usual suspects.&nbsp; God, I wish that place was closer.&nbsp; A lot of it is your standard Brooklyn beers, but they do get a nice selection of international beers and I&#039;ve noticed they change their stock seasonally.&nbsp; Plus there&#039;s the added perk of passing the Pio Pio on your way back.&nbsp; Go Yankees and beer!! :mrgreen:

				Was just at the TJ&#039;s and they do have a great selection. They have the Hitachino which I absolutely love. Heliopolis has surely been mentioned, and their selection is just amazing too. Was there yesterday and felt like a kid in a candy store. Having a &quot;banana bread beer&quot; right now, made by Wells, which is pretty tasty. Was skeptical but had to try it.

				My first trip to France/Europe in the early 1990s was like a whole new world of beer had opened up. Never drank the stuff until I discovered the peach/raspberry lambics, the Panaché (half lemonade/half beer found in vending machines), the Belgians (St. Sixtus, Chimay, Duvel, Trappiste, etc.) and even banana beer!&nbsp; :lol: <br /><br />Gradually, began noticing the different internat&#039;l varieties in local (gourmet) delis, so no need to move over there after all! <br /><br />Anyway. Glad that Americans are embracing more than Bud and Coors. Once took a guy- hardcore Bud drinker- to the Crescent Lounge, where he tried Belgian beers for the first time. Problem was, he kept drinking them as if they *were* Bud!! I think he was a little shocked when the bill arrived&nbsp; :-D
