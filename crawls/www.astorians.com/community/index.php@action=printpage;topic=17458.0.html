				There must be a way to find out who these little shits are. The admin and the mods obviously don&#039;t give a crap. Do you think they even neg nod their own posts? BTW, I stopped being a supporter because of this. I would rather deal with the advertisements than the neg nodders. I am not alone. Look around admin and mods . . . how many supporters do you have left? They are all gonna jump ship. There are too many social networking sites around where you don&#039;t have to deal with this BS.

				The neg nods do get out of hand, particularly on some threads where it seems that some &quot;serial nodders&quot; go through and neg nod everything, regardless of content.&nbsp; That said, I&#039;m not against the feature completely, and when I see threads like this, I can&#039;t help but think of this...<br /><br />(http://shadowwar.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/stop-whining.jpeg)

				I&#039;m sorry....but this is not a dead horse. Something changed in the last few weeks. Someone is going through and neg nodding every damn post in a thread. I should know because the thread I posted about looking up NYC in 1929 had a neg nod on every freaking post. And on starwinds post about winter.<br /><br />Look, I&#039;m not mad....I remember talking with Pineapple ages ago about nods and finally came around the her way of thinking and haven&#039;t cared since then. Hell, there&#039;s been times when I&#039;ve deserved to be neg nodded. Like when I call Augustine a whorish prick.<br /><br />As I said....someone is doing something in a malicious way. And I don&#039;t understand why I shouldn&#039;t be upset about someone maligning a thread I was proud to post

				By the way, I&#039;m not looking to get into another argument about this. Internet arguments are annoying as hell, and I tend to get roped into them because I have a lot of opinions about a lot of things, and I like typing stuff and I especially enjoy procrastinating. My last post may appear to be baiting, but it wasn&#039;t saying anything that hasn&#039;t already been said here before. I think it&#039;s fair for people to know that their nods are being tracked, even though they appear anonymous for the average poster.

				I used to take the neg nods personally but then i realized that was a waste of time. &nbsp;especially when i post about something i somewhat personal, or something i truly care about, not just, &quot;this restaurant is good&quot;.<br /><br />if it makes somewhere feel better about themselves to click that little thumbs down button, then by all mean, click away.<br /><br />i actually like the nod system. &nbsp;sometimes i don&#039;t have anything to add, it&#039;s all been said, but i want to express my agreement.

This site could have become something special instead of just another internet message board of people who don&#039;t know each other and who don&#039;t care about each other.<br /><br />As for me, well, I&#039;ve met some really wonderful friends as a result of my past 5 years here. As a life-long resident of Astoria I watched how this site attracted the most diverse members of our community and how friendships were formed from just speaking (albeit with our fingers) with others. Neighbors met neighbors. Patrons met owners. Renters met landlords. For a while it stopped being the old ones versus the young ones; or the natives versus the transient interlopers.&nbsp; Now it&#039;s business as usual and the young and the arrogant have won . . . this round!

But it saddens me most for the nodders, not the person posting.<br />Would it be possible at all to have a section for threads without nods? I dont know if the software allows that.

But that&#039;s what happened as a result of the nods. We (Astorians) used to have frequent get-togethers and outings. We seemed determined to get to know one another. And we were very successful. Many lifetime friendships were formed here on this board. It wasn&#039;t like any other message board. We all live within walking distance of each other. At one time it was proposed that we have a little pin to identify each other on the train, supermarket or just walking down the street. <br /><br />Now people like you, who have been around for less than a year, think of astorians dot com as just another message board. <br /><br />What a shame. This site could have become something special instead of just another internet message board of people who don&#039;t know each other and who don&#039;t care about each other.<br /><br />As for me, well, I&#039;ve met some really wonderful friends as a result of my past 5 years here. As a life-long resident of Astoria I watched how this site attracted the most diverse members of our community and how friendships were formed from just speaking (albeit with our fingers) with others. Neighbors met neighbors. Patrons met owners. Renters met landlords. For a while it stopped being the old ones versus the young ones; or the natives versus the transient interlopers.&nbsp; Now it&#039;s business as usual and the young and the arrogant have won . . . this round!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Mac...obviously this board means more to you than I, and because of that I&#039;m sorry that my post probably came off as smug and lame. &nbsp;I guess what I&#039;m getting at is, if someone you don&#039;t have a good relationship with, whether in real life or virtually, neg nods you, who really cares if they do it. &nbsp;It&#039;s something that someone can do in a matter of seconds, and, in most cases, I&#039;m guessing the neg nodder doesn&#039;t even really think about their choice. &nbsp;Someone may do it to be a jerk, because they don&#039;t &quot;like&quot; the poster, or just to be flat out inflammatory. &nbsp;I honestly read posts based on the title of the thread, and whether I think it&#039;s something that interests me. &nbsp;If a particular post has a ton of negative nods, it doesn&#039;t stop me from reading it. &nbsp;I read it anyway, because I can make the decision myself as to whether I will find the post intelligent, worthwhile, etc. &nbsp;If folks&#039; feelings are getting hurt over their post receiving too many negative nods, well then I suggest they look into some counseling because it&#039;s really not a big deal. &nbsp;That&#039;s all I&#039;m getting at...

				errrrrrrr....I kind of hate to say that this thread reminded me that I needed to renew my supporter status or whatever it&#039;s called, and I did so the other day. Almost all of my friends in the &#039;hood have been met through here. You all are why I love living here :)<br /><br />(I didn&#039;t renew when it was up last yr because I was under/unemployed but now I have a job that people give me money to do on a regular basis! Huzzah! Also I don&#039;t mind the nods, but that&#039;s just me? :) You can neg nod me if you want. It&#039;s ok! NEG YOUR ASS OUT.)<br /><br />I am down for a meetup! It&#039;s been way way way too long.

				We had a get-together last month and it was a smashing success.&nbsp; No one was held back from attending because of this nodding feature.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been a member of this board when we used to get together more regularly and it was a lot of fun.&nbsp; It didn&#039;t die down because of a few nods.&nbsp; &nbsp;Why in the world would it?&nbsp; I mean, people get busy.&nbsp; They move away.&nbsp; They have things to do.&nbsp; Planning takes a lot of time.&nbsp; And if you make reservations at a restaurant and not everyone shows up, which does happen because people in this city do get busy, it takes more planning with the restaurant.&nbsp; It&#039;s a lot sometimes for one to take on regularly.&nbsp; I think things died down just naturally, and no one really jumped in or stepped up to the plate and organized something.&nbsp; It has nothing to do with nods.&nbsp; Weird that it would be attributed to something like that.&nbsp; I think people are just busy.&nbsp; Yet when Meg held the get-togeher last month people jumped at it.&nbsp; The community is here.&nbsp; It wants to come out.&nbsp; It just needs someone to lead the way.&nbsp; And maybe it can rotate who leads it.&nbsp; Would you like to organize something?&nbsp; Why not do it?

Saying that I &quot;wiggle&quot; in nod statistics in many of my posts doesn&#039;t clearly mean anything, so hopefully you understand how I would&#039;ve gotten the impression that you were saying I frequently appear in the nod statistics of my posts, as if I go around positive nodding myself all the time in order to look more awesome than I already am (if that&#039;s even possible). I&#039;m not a conspiracy theorist - it sounded like that&#039;s exactly what you were saying, to which I was like &quot;whoa, dude.&quot; But... okay.
