				i haven&#39;t been getting very many fortunes, more crappy proverbs. i noticed the red ones are fortunes and the blue ones proverbs. i don&#39;t have a good example of crap proverb, but my fave fortune was when my buddy treated me to sushi at sunrise (because i let him up the office and let him take a boatload of ties...back when i could do that in our old building, can&#39;t do that in the new one) and my fortune read &quot;there is a true and lasting friendship between you both&quot;<br />that was really cool.

In a way true. The Chinese food we come to know here State&#39;s side, is quite different from traditional Chinese food.<br /><br />Although mainland Chinese food isn&#39;t as greasy as it is here, food from the south still tends to be quite unhealthy (lots of fat, and not much use of raw veggies).

				Shanghainese cuisine is great.&nbsp; The Shau Lon Paw (Soup Dumplings) are among the greatest treats ever.&nbsp; How I wish we had a place to get them in Astoria.&nbsp; Where do you go in Chinatown and Flushing for Shanghainese food?&nbsp; I like Shanghai Garden on Elizabeth Street myself.
