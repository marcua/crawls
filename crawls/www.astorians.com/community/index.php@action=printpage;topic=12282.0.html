				I know im crazy, but I was just think about how the stock market is so low and all these fiancial loan places are going under. I really think that this is all a big plan to implement a new type of currency, a currency shared by Canada, Mexico and the United States called the Amero. This is just one step closer to a one world gov&#039;t.<br /><br />I am still doing some reseach on this, so i dont know much.<br /><br />(google and youtube seem to have some interviews and info on this matter)<br /><br />Europe has the Euro, now America will have the Amero....<br /><br />Anyone have any concerns or know anything about this ? <br /><br />Discuss...<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I would consider it a possibility.<br /><br />We are experiencing the largest deficit in all of our history, are printing money at a rate never seen before, and with all these bailouts, are literally trillions in the hole. The dollar has been going up recently - however this is probably due to the unwinding and de-leveraging of certain areas, such as hedge funds.<br /><br />Historically, currency debasements / failures have occurred many times.&nbsp; A situation where we see hyperinflation, such as experienced by certain countries in South America in the past couple of decades, and the Wiemar Republic in the early 1900s is certainly a possibility for the Dollar.&nbsp; <br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t rule out a currency collapse due to hyperinflation and there are steps we can take to protect ourselves from it.&nbsp; <br />This would be a perfect time to introduce a new currency - or once again back the currency with a standard, rather then utilizing fractional reserve banking with promises to pay. Which is essentially what the dollar is right now, a Federal Reserve Note - a promise to pay. <br /><br />And btw the Federal Reserve is it&#039;s own private entity - it is not Federal in the sense that most would think - it is not the government.<br /><br />some reading:<br /><br />inflation in Venezuela - this is recent : http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/01/02/business/LA-FIN-Venezuela-Inflation.php<br /><br />hyperinflation - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation<br /><br /><br />

				Let&#039;s also keep in mind that this is not a new experiment when looking at things globally: the Euro replaced 12 national currencies with one currency that is valid in all of those countries, and one European central bank in charge of financial decisions.&nbsp; So the precedent already exists.

				PJ is right &amp; it is not a hoax.<br />Did you know that President Bush has signed the NORTH AMERICAN UNION? <br /><br />PJ pay no mind to the general public, they get their news from FOX 5, and a whole bunch of corporate media stations.<br />they also drink fluoridated water :-)<br /><br />

				another reason why i think that the Gov&#039;t wants to implement this new plan is to stop the high rate of money being sent out....for example...Mexico...hundreds of thousands of Illegal and Legal Mexicans work to supprt their fammily&#039;s in Mexico........so once they get paid - they send the money righ out..so its not being spent in the states and not being circulated like it should..over time all that money adds up and ultimaltly hurts the U.S economy....so this plan will unite Canada, U.S and Mexico elliminating the high rate of money being sent out....this is my opinion and the way i see it

I... first became aware of it, Mandrake, during the physical act of love.<br /><strong>Group Capt. Lionel Mandrake:</strong> Hmm.<br /><strong>General Jack D.

Lionel Mandrake:</strong> Hmm.<br /><strong>General Jack D. Ripper:</strong> I can assure you it has not recurred, Mandrake. Women uh... women sense my power and they seek the life essence. I, uh... I do not avoid women, Mandrake.<br /><strong>Group Capt. Lionel Mandrake:</strong> No.<br /><strong>General Jack D. Ripper:</strong> But I... I do deny them my essence. <br /><br />Thank you for reminding me of this favorite scene.
