				The conventions are more about biographies and showmanship.<br />Though they surely have updated a platform somewhere.<br /><br /><br />I am reminded again of<br />www.ontheissues.org/ <br /><br /><br />Thankfully, the site notes Obama, McCain, as well as<br />Barr, Nader, McKinney, ...<br /><br />If only the &#039;debates&#039; would be as inclusive.<br />http://www.opendebates.org/<br /><br /><br />&quot;A spokeswoman for Mr. Obama&#039;s campaign declined to shut the door on more debates, but his advisers admit that, with Mr. Obama emerging as the front-runner, he&#039;s reluctant to give his opponent more of a nationwide forum.&quot;<br />

				OK, As&nbsp; everyone&nbsp; here knows, my politics&nbsp; veer to&nbsp; the Right. Still, I always enjoy&nbsp; Political&nbsp; Conventions, speeches&nbsp; that make me cringe, infuriating and&nbsp; even emotional. <br /><br />First... the DEMOCRAT&nbsp; NATIONAL CONVENTION 2008<br /><br />The first&nbsp; day had some&nbsp; &#039;religious&#039; woman speaking about&nbsp; how&nbsp; &#039;we&#039;&nbsp; mistreated&nbsp; Indians, had Slaves and are in no position&nbsp; &nbsp;to remove&nbsp; &#039;evil&#039; people.&nbsp; This was&nbsp; a bad start in my view, it reinforces the&nbsp; feeling by many that&nbsp; the party is run by radical&nbsp; leftists. Still, this was early afternoon, by the first evening, we heard the usual&nbsp; fluff, nothing special. <br /><br />Day 2, Hillary Clinton, in an orange pantsuit, with Chelsea&nbsp; in tow, my, unfortunately, Senator :D&nbsp; &nbsp;gave&nbsp; a&nbsp; speech, mostly, about what else.. herself.. oh yeah, and Vote&nbsp; For&nbsp; Obama.&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; Obviously she felt it was hers and it was taken away.<br /><br />Day&nbsp; 3, Bill takes&nbsp; the stage, and rips&nbsp; into Bush, of course, most of his points&nbsp; were&nbsp; exaggeration and outright falsehoods, but, it is&nbsp; a&nbsp; political&nbsp; conventions and he is &#039;Bubba.&#039; ;)&nbsp; This over shadowed the 65 year old&nbsp; Biden, who&nbsp; for some reason represents &#039;change&#039;&nbsp; like Obama, even though Biden has been a Senator&nbsp; longer than McCain and is only 6 years&nbsp; younger. Apparently, &#039;age&#039; only matters&nbsp; for Republicans?&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; Anyway, the mans&nbsp; speech was&nbsp; incoherent and full of&nbsp; stumbles, if Bush had made&nbsp; this speech it would be&nbsp; on the nightly news&nbsp; as&nbsp; a&nbsp; &#039;gaffe&#039;. Of course&nbsp; the Press&nbsp; being on the democrat&nbsp; side, except for FOX News, which at least offers&nbsp; the other&nbsp; side, only featured&nbsp; Clinton.<br /><br />Which brings us to Day 4, and the Obama &#039;Rock Concert.&#039; This has to go&nbsp; down in history as one of the most excessive, megalomaniac&nbsp; event in Convention history. I mean using a separate&nbsp; stadium is not even done by sitting Presidents&nbsp; for reelection, let alone someone who has been barely in politics. It was pure Hollywood, no joke, Spielberg and others&nbsp; have helped set up the effects, I half expected&nbsp; R2D2&nbsp; to show up with&nbsp; C3PO. If the democrats think this&nbsp; makes them palatable to&nbsp; the &#039;common man&#039;, well, I just&nbsp; don&#039;t&nbsp; see it. Obama made a list of what he says&nbsp; is wrong and how to fix it. IMO, It was&nbsp; worthy&nbsp; of a great&nbsp; Greco-Roman Coliseum event, but, in the end it was a&nbsp; &#039;hollywood&#039; extravaganza, with little substance.<br /><br />In all, the Democrat&nbsp; Convention inspired&nbsp; me, once&nbsp; again, to vote Republican.&nbsp; :D&nbsp; &nbsp;Seriously, anyone else, even if you dont agree, let me know. I promise&nbsp; I won&#039;t&nbsp; &#039;bite&#039;, just &#039;growl&#039;&nbsp; a little.&nbsp; :D&nbsp; Now on to the&nbsp; Republican National Convention and&nbsp; Nov.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)<br /><br />REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION 2008<br /><br /><br />I am a Republican, so anything I say here will self-destruct in five seconds... ;D&nbsp; Just kidding. <br /><br />Well, The Republicans had their turn and it started&nbsp; off&nbsp; with a Hurricane&nbsp; and ended&nbsp; with a Warrior. Sounds&nbsp; like&nbsp; my kind of folks.&nbsp; :D<br /><br />Day 1) This was&nbsp; dominated&nbsp; by the &#039;news&#039;&nbsp; of Gustav the relatively mild&nbsp; Hurricane&nbsp; that was finally&nbsp; handled&nbsp; correctly, by those&nbsp; MOST responsible for&nbsp; such things in a state. The&nbsp; newly&nbsp; elected&nbsp; Republican Gov. Jindel who was&nbsp; on McCain&#039;s&nbsp; short list for VP, in Louisiana. Mrs. McCain and Mrs. Bush urged conventioneers&nbsp; to put off&nbsp; the politics&nbsp; and help fellow&nbsp; Americans&nbsp; in the Gulf Region. Sen. McCain went to the region and&nbsp; it showed&nbsp; a great American spirit.&nbsp; The press spent&nbsp; the day&nbsp; in what became&nbsp; a disgraceful&nbsp; tirade&nbsp; against the pregnant 17 year-old daughter&nbsp; of the VP, cause&nbsp; she&nbsp; was unmarried and *gasp* her mother&nbsp; is&nbsp; not in favor of Abortion and Free Condoms&nbsp; for everybody&nbsp; in school. <br /><br />Day 2) It really started&nbsp; to get rolling. Highlight&nbsp; for me&nbsp; was former Senator&nbsp; Fred Thompson. The one time actor, really laid into the empty suit at&nbsp; the top&nbsp; of&nbsp; the democrat&nbsp; ticket and&nbsp; the 30&nbsp; year&nbsp; career &#039;yes&#039;&nbsp; man as&nbsp; VP for&nbsp; the democrats. He also recounted&nbsp; in sobering detail the top of&nbsp; the GOP Ticket McCains, Vietnam experience and how he went to Washington&nbsp; and fought&nbsp; for what&nbsp; he believed, even as it bucked&nbsp; his own party. Fantastic.<br /><br />Day 3) Guiliani, the Mayor&nbsp; of NYC, on 9/11, much maligned&nbsp; by a horrendous&nbsp; one-sided&nbsp; press&nbsp; that controls, sadly, my fair city of NY, proved once&nbsp; again, why he was able to clean&nbsp; up a city, run for decades by the corrupt democrat machine. A city of millions which had&nbsp; 2,500&nbsp; murders&nbsp; a year and&nbsp; turned it into a great town by the time he left.&nbsp; He highlighted&nbsp; how the democrats&nbsp; had lost touch in what had happened on 9/11 and how the top of their&nbsp; ticket had less executive experience than Palin. Still, this was Palins&nbsp; evening. Palin, who went from relative&nbsp; unknown to VP pick and had the sharks&nbsp; of&nbsp; the press&nbsp; trying to pick her apart, proved why she was&nbsp; called&nbsp; &#039;barracuda.&#039;&nbsp; She lay into&nbsp; Obama&#039;s&nbsp; &#039;styro-foam&#039; Greek Temple&nbsp; Spectacle and showed&nbsp; exactly&nbsp; what it was, a Hollywood&nbsp; production with no substance. :D She laid&nbsp; out her personal experience and showed that she is no God, but, certainly&nbsp; God Fearing and a woman who rose&nbsp; from Mayor to Governor, in a&nbsp; state&nbsp; vital to our energy&nbsp; needs and even Northern Defense. She&nbsp; proved&nbsp; to&nbsp; me she is more capable&nbsp; as the VP for&nbsp; the GOP, than Obama&nbsp; could show&nbsp; as&nbsp; President for&nbsp; the democrats. Nice&nbsp; going, Palin.<br /><br />Day 4)&nbsp; This was McCains night. He&nbsp; was preceded&nbsp; by Cindy McCain, a true&nbsp; class act.&nbsp; As McCain began to speak, a couple of&nbsp; the Left-wing Thugs that have been breaking windows and causing mayhem outside tried&nbsp; to disrupt&nbsp; the man from speaking to which McCain responded after&nbsp; one of&nbsp; the nuts, a woman, who had to be dragged out, &#039;Not To Listen To The Static.&#039;&nbsp; This is&nbsp; the face of the so-called&nbsp; &#039;Anti-War&#039;&nbsp; movement? LOL!!&nbsp; Anti-War&nbsp; MY *** . Anyway, Senator&nbsp; McCain laid out his domestic&nbsp; programs&nbsp; &nbsp;of&nbsp; lowering taxes and holding the feet to the fire of the bureaucracy. He listed&nbsp; the striking lack of experience of&nbsp; Obama as opposed&nbsp; to his obvious&nbsp; experience. Finally, he&nbsp; recounted&nbsp; why he HATES&nbsp; war and why any military&nbsp; person knows&nbsp; that to be free is not easy and just&nbsp; be &#039;anti-war&#039; , but, to actually confront evil for REAL&nbsp; peace.&nbsp; He ended&nbsp; with&nbsp; the crowd up&nbsp; on it&#039;s feet cheering. No columns, no&nbsp; fireworks, just some balloons and confetti of&nbsp; the Red White and Blue. A simple warrior who loves his country like his family and above himself. <br /><br />The Convention showed&nbsp; to me TWO&nbsp; genuine&nbsp; people, one&nbsp; a&nbsp; true&nbsp; outsider and one&nbsp; who has&nbsp; bucked even his&nbsp; own party and has fought&nbsp; for&nbsp; his nation, here and abroad. The&nbsp; Choice Is Yours Folks...<br /><br />I Have MADE MINE..<br /><br /><strong>McCAIN/PALIN&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp; :-)

				The problem is, people actually actively look for, and pay attention to, information that fits with or confirms what they already know. And we reject or skim over information that contradicts it. <br /><br />So when we hear or read about something &quot;great&quot; that the candidate from the opposite side we&#039;re on did, we discount it because it doesn&#039;t fit with our idea of how horrible he is, but when we hear something &quot;great&quot; about our candidate, we embrace it. <br /><br />The other problem is, Sarah Palin is getting all the media attention now. Before that, Obama was getting all the media attention. And the polls reflect the name people are hearing the most about... <br /><br />Unrelated to the media attention, and breaking away from the impartial nature of my post thus far, the problem that I see with Republican thinking is that the &quot;trickle down&quot; economic effect - help the rich get richer and the money will trickle down to benefit everyone - no longer works. Sure, maybe 50 years ago it made sense to give big companies tax breaks because then they could employ more people in their factories or whatever... But now the tax break helps to pay for more sweat shop labor overseas. How does this help all the unemployed people in America?
