				mentioned in the article...people store their contacts in tap water? how dumb are people!<br /><br />i&#39;ve been wearing contacts for 11 years, and my last few prescriptions have gotten much stronger and i have been getting eye infections. my eye doctor actually recommended to ease up on the contacts, so i wear my glasses more, especially since i got new ones that i can actually see out of.<br />i&#39;ve contemplated lasik since i&#39;d love to never have to purchase glasses, contacts, solutions etc ever again. if i factor in my glasses/eye exam/contacts and solution purchases thus far this year, i think i could&#39;ve had lasik. but slicing my cornea doesn&#39;t sound fun and i don&#39;t know anyone who has had it done to give me first hand information.<br />other than that episode of the king of queens.

				I wouldn&#39;t recommend it for everyone. If you are over 40 - severely myopic, have health conditions such as diabetes or high blood pressure it might be contraindicated.<br />If I researched it more I might not have done it. I&#39;m OK now, but still need reading glasses on ocassion and it&#39;s not perfect.<br />Had it done about 2 years ago. <br />The procedure is not that long - but then again roller coasters don&#39;t take long either.<br />After being given half a valium and eye drops to desensitize the pain:<br />Eye clamps exactly like those used on Malcolm McDowall in the movie A Clockwork Orange are inserted in your eyelids to keep them open during the procedure. THe pain begins.<br />What seems to be shotglass - but is a vacuum is placed on the operated eye. The other eye is covered. As the vacuum begins the one eye loses sight and fades to black.<br />This is explained before hand but still the temporary blindness is unsettling.<br />As it is removed blurry vision returns and you get to see the scalpel cut your cornea and you see the Doc holding it. You hope neither he or you sneezes as it&#39;s there like a contact lens, except it&#39;s your real cornea. You then are swung under the laser which looks like HAL in 2001 - a circle of white light with a red laser in the middle and you are told to keep staring at the red dot. This is hard. The laser grinds down the lower layer of the cornea at a programmed time according to your degree of visual acuity.<br />Then the surgeon makes flaps at the edge to tuck the upper cornea in place. Not a comfortable experience.<br />THe procedure is then repeated for the other eye.<br />At&nbsp; home for the next few days I could not read - or even watch TV. I cried that I would not see again.<br />The Dr and staff acted like everything was OK. I had my doughts. One eye is undercorrected for closer vision but mine in my estimation was way under corrected.<br />THe other eye could not see well&nbsp; either.<br /><br />After&nbsp; a couple of weeks the Doctor noticed that the one eye didn&#39;t settle in pace right and had a wrinkle on it. I was rushed into an operating suite and had the non laser part of the surgery re-done. Without a valium and the drops tossed in quickly it felt like I was punched in the eye 1000 times. He then placed a temporary contact lens over it to make sure it stayed right.<br /><br />After a few months the other eye was redone but I think he over compensated for the under correction.<br /><br />Sensitivity to light&nbsp; still lasted for many month later and good that this period was winter.<br />By next summer I was OK - not perfect but OK.<br /><br />This wonderful adventure cost over 3,000 bucks - just to let you know I didn&#39;t go to cheapie laser Dr. Nick. The surgeon is Chairman of Opthamology at my Hospital and has impeccable credentials. <br /><br />Later I did find though that many surgeons would not list me as a good candidate and do my surgery for what I mentioned above. I don&#39;t know if I would have listened and might have just searched for one who would. I felt very desperate that even with contacts I was using reading glasses and still having problems.<br /><br />At least I removed that 1 level of the lenses and it&#39;s easier for water sports which I love.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I was under the impression that Lasik was done while you were asleep.&nbsp; This sounds like my experience with oral surgery to&nbsp; take all 4 wisdom teeth out.&nbsp; All they gave me was some gas which did not make me laugh, but made me a little more numb but better loopy to imagine all sorts of horrible things while I saw and heard every rip, tear, crack, and pull they did in my mouth.&nbsp; The pain was muted but it was there, and the fact that you feel the tugging, and hear the cracking, it&#39;s not good.&nbsp; I got nauseaus when the 4 hours were over and I looked at the blood on the bib.&nbsp; I have no idea why they didn&#39;t put me out, but I swore I would never go thru this again.&nbsp; It was horrible, and makes me wonder if I&#39;ll ever even make it through a labor.&nbsp; I&#39;d rather just adopt.<br /><br />So tell me, Josh, did they put you out?

				I have had the same level prescription for the last five years (I&#39;ve been wearing glasses since I was 10) and might consider doing laser surgery. I am just afraid of the cost and am unsure of reputation when it comes to safety of the procedure. After all, a laser is cutting through your eyes. Jtrane, who did you go to for your operation and how much did it cost? Lanseaux, do you know who your friend went to see? Would insurance cover these things or is it considered purely cosmetic? thanks...

				My insurance - and I believe most if not all others do not cover it. They consider it cosmetic. For me that was not the issue - I was ready to get the dog and cane. <br />I know i got a bit graphic - but people seemed interested and I thought I&#39;d give you my perspective. <br />Of course most people having it done experience no problems whatsoever. I just was sharing that it is not for everyone and it might be contraindicated in some cases. People should research it very thoroughly before commiting to any surgery.<br />

				Bryan, I see that you were considered &quot;not a good candidate&quot; for the procedure. Doctors have told me that using a phrase like &quot;good candidate&quot; is a red flag. You are either a viable candidate or not. But there are different types of laser procedure depending on the type of vision or eye problem one has. (I don&#39;t remember which is which, so check with a reputable ophthalmologist, always ask about his/her rate of complications, etc.)<br /><br />I doubt that any health insurance will cover this procedure; they all consider it cosmetic surgery. I paid for it using my flexible benefit plan.

				Glaucoma has nothing to do with the lens of the eye, which is what Lasik deals with, so they probably don&#39;t have much of an interaction. Ah, here&#39;s a web page about it (http://www.asklasikdocs.com/faq/main/GlaucomaandLASIK.htm); looks like you can still have Lasik if you have mild, treated glaucoma. <br /><br />My parents have both had Lasik, and like it, although my mom had complications. She sleeps with her eyes open sometimes, and went into REM sleep and knock a corneal flap out of place and had to have it reseated the next day. Ouch, it makes me woozy just thinking about it! Note that if you&#39;re of a certain age, Lasik will fix your nearsightedness, but you&#39;ll still need reading glasses.<br /><br />I, personally, am happy with my glasses. They&#39;d have to knock me clean out before I&#39;d let anyone get close to my eyes with a razor blade...<br />

				Well, considering I&#39;m the type that can&#39;t even look at a needle going in my arm, much less a scalpel coming straight at my eyeball, I don&#39;t think I&#39;m a good candidate for this.&nbsp; My eyes are horrible and I have many problems, so I have no idea if I could get it done anyway.&nbsp; But my fear is that I&#39;m get so skeeved out about these things, that I would flinch when I saw the scalpel and end up with my whole eye cut out.&nbsp; I have had laser surgery to repair a retinal tear though, and no sharp instruments were used.&nbsp; Until they invent some way to do this without cutting and perhaps put me under hypnosis, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be able to stand it.&nbsp; Oh well.

				Daisy, I complete understand where you&#39;re coming from, and I ain&#39;t getting Lasik either. This said, have you ever been &quot;mildly sedated&quot; as they put it? I&#39;ve had it done for, uh, another unpleasant medical procedure, and it really works. You&#39;re awake, you know what&#39;s going on, if there&#39;s pain you feel it, you just don&#39;t care. Really. Depending what drugs they give you, you might remember it later, or not, but if you do remember, it won&#39;t be very unpleasant memories since there was no feeling of &quot;trauma&quot; to cause those memories of the procedure to be stored strongly.

				So, before I had lasik, I ate at Katz Deli, and had pastrami on rye.&nbsp; It was so f***ing good, I can&#39;t even tell you.&nbsp; Now that I&#39;ve had the surgery, I can see the detail in the meat so much more clearly.&nbsp; It makes the food experience so much more enjoyable.

				Have there been any studies on whether the effects of lasik change over time (as the patient gets older)?<br /><br />I currently wear rigid gas permeable contacts and when I first got them, my optometrist told me that they would prevent my nearsightedness from getting worse because they make it difficult for the cornea to change shape - my prescription has changed very little in the years I&#39;ve had them.

				Apparently your lenses harden as you age (presbyopia), which is why people aged 40 or over start to need reading glasses. Having lasik surgery will not affect this process.

				I&#39;m with Daisy.&nbsp; I want to do Lasik, but am far too scared, especially if I have to be awake while they&#39;re doing it.&nbsp; I can&#39;t stand my eye exams and flinch (the fact that I really dislike my Opthamologist probably doesn&#39;t help).&nbsp; I would worry about doing this thinking that I would lose an eye or two.

				I worked in an opthalmology lab for 3 years studying diseases caused by contact lenses.&nbsp; Our main effort was to find cures other than a cornea transplant.&nbsp; The lab was in Tennessee but was actually funded by George Steibrenner&#39;s wife...good to see (sorry for the pun&nbsp; :lol:)&nbsp; <br /><br />All I can say is DO NOT WEAR CONTACTS.&nbsp; I wear glasses and I will not even consider wearing contacts.&nbsp; There is going to be a major shortage of corneas in the very near future because an overwhelming majority of contact lense wearers will need cornea transplants.&nbsp; The need for a transplant is due to a variety of reasons, some were touched upon in that short article.&nbsp; The packages that the lenses are sold in are not always sterile.&nbsp; Your hands are rarely, if ever sterile.&nbsp; A brand new lense from an unopened package could have the &quot;bugs&quot; already in them.&nbsp; Add all of that to improper usage of the lenses and you have a prescription for disaster.&nbsp; When my friends tell me they fell asleep with their lenses on I can only cringe in disbelief.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I don&#39;t mean to frighten anyone, but please please take proper care when wearing contact lenses. <br /><br />---end of public service message...<br /><br />

Traumatic indeed. No, the stuff they usually use for at least the procedure I had is intravenous. I think I had a choice of several different anaesthetic options. Sometimes IV valium is used, which kills your memory too, but I had something different, I don&#39;t recall the name. I don&#39;t think they&#39;d just rely on laughing gas for Lasik. It&#39;s too important that you be relaxed and compliant, I suspect... Recovery afterwards is a little slower for the IV drugs than for just laughing gas and the local, though...

				To clarify : Before my operation I was told that I was a good candidate for the surgery. I was speaking to a highly regarded eye surgeon who is Department Chair of Opthamology and I trusted his opinion.<br /><br />In my job I talk to doctors all day. One day I chatted with another eye doctor hypothetically and he said and this was over the phone and speaking generally that he didn&#39;t think I would be a good candidate. This was after I had already done it.<br /><br />Knowing myself as well as I do, and the situation I was confronting vision wise, I was really hoping I would be a good candidate and would have probably doctor shopped till I found someone who agreed.<br /><br />In retrospect I say it&#39;s good to get 2nd, 3rd and 4th opinions. <br /><br />BTW I&#39;m not totally knocking LASIK - in the end it worked out pretty well. Now if I can only find the Fountain of Youth Formulae I&#39;m so feverishly working on and the cure for diabetes.....<br /><br />.

				I&#39;m coming into this rather late, but here&#39;s my 2 cents.<br /><br />I had horrible eye sight growing up and started wearing contacts at age 11.&nbsp; I had three horrible eye viruses throughout the years, all due to contact lense wear.&nbsp; By age 18 my prescriptions stabilized and we started seriously talking about lasik.&nbsp; At this point I could barely see how many fingers were put up in front of my face without contacts or glasses.&nbsp; <br /><br />So I had the surgery when I turned 20.&nbsp; My parents and I did a lot of research and got a lot of recommendations before and we spent a little more because we chose a world class eye center in Miami.&nbsp; (Although the insurance did not cover the surgery, my parents took advantage of the tax-free spending account for medical purposes so at least there was some benefit).&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes it was uncomfortable, yes it was scary (and smelled bad as was mentioned earlier), and yes, they popped a blood vessel while doing my second eye so I felt everything.&nbsp; Even with all of that I still say, yes, it was worth it when I woke up the next day and could see perfectly.&nbsp; Four years later, I still have 20/20 vision and haven&#39;t had any issues since.&nbsp;

I&#39;m a -7.75 in one eye, -8 in the other. Like I said earlier, I like wearing glasses, so I probably won&#39;t bother with lasik. That, and the whole &quot;removing your eye from your head and cutting into it&quot; thing. Ugghhhh...<br /><br />I wore contacts pretty much non-stop from ages 11 - 21 or so. I really hope I didn&#39;t do too much damage - I used to wear them from the moment I woke up to the time I went to sleep, so I&#39;m not too optimistic. Now I just wear them when working out or when wearing glasses isn&#39;t the best idea (like, I&#39;m going to 6 flags this weekend so I&#39;ll wear them - don&#39;t want to lose my $400 glasses on a rollercoaster!)
