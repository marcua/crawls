				As we guessed in an earlier thread (http://www.astorians.com/index.php?topic=3606.0), Yahoo Photos is now closing so Yahoo can focus solely on Flickr. At least they gave us a warning before deleting all photos. I hadn&#039;t moved all photos to Flickr yet, so now it gives the Yahoo Photos user 4 options. Here is the letter from Yahoo.<br /><br /><em>Dear Yahoo! Photos user,<br /><br />For some time now, we&#039;ve supported two great photo sharing services: Yahoo! Photos and Flickr. But even good things come to an end, and we&#039;ve decided to close Yahoo! Photos to focus all our efforts on Flickr — the award-winning photo sharing community that TIME Magazine has called &quot;completely addictive.&quot;<br /><br />We will officially close Yahoo! Photos on Thursday, September 20, 2007, at 9 p.m. PDT. Until then, we are offering you the opportunity to move to another photo sharing service (Flickr, KODAK Gallery, Shutterfly, Snapfish, or Photobucket), download your original-resolution photos back to your computer, or buy an archive CD from our featured partner (for users of the New Yahoo! Photos only). All you need to do is tell us what to do with your photos before we close, after which any photos remaining on Yahoo! Photos will be deleted and no longer accessible.<br /><br />Of course, we hope you&#039;ll join us at Flickr (you can even use your Yahoo! ID), but we also realize that Flickr may not be for everyone. In the end, we want you to find the service that&#039;s right for you, and we hope you take some time to learn more about your options before making this important decision.<br /><br />Please give us your decision by Thursday, September 20, 2007, at 9 p.m. PDT. After that time, any photos remaining in Yahoo! Photos will be deleted. Click here to make your decision, or review a list of our frequently asked questions.<br /><br />Thanks for being a part of the Web&#039;s largest photo sharing service — we hope to see you over at Flickr!<br /><br />The Yahoo! Photos team<br /></em>

				I keep checking my very neglected yahoo account for this email and i still haven&#039;t gotten it. And i have a flickr account that i log in with using my yahoo id. you would think that yahoo photos users that are already flickr users would have gotten them by now. one of my coworkers already made the move. and as to be expected there are some kinks.

				Try and migrate your work over to flickr. It really is a great site.&nbsp; I use it constantly.&nbsp;

				believe me i want to. i just think it would make more sense if yahoo/flickr sent the email to people using both already at the beginning of this process rather than those who do not. (like my coworker who had no idea what flickr was until i showed her my stuff on it).<br />I&#039;m entirely too lazy to manually do it myself. if they are going to migrate it for me then that&#039;s the route i&#039;m going. but with my luck they&#039;ll send me that email at the beginning of september....you know, close to when they close yahoo photos.

				I actually got the email to my email account that I used as an alternate when I signed up for Yahoo and not directly to my Yahoo account. I would try logging into Yahoo photos and see if they prompt you to migrate your photos then. I doubt you will have to do it manually. I had over 20 albums of pictures on Yahoo and they all moved to Snapfish without a problem.

				OT: Speaking of Snapfish, I absolutely love them!&nbsp; I digital scrapbook and I design everything large enough for poster prints and they are just the best for that. <br /><br />
