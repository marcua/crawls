				<br />Hello...<br />Well, it&#039;s Thursday, the day when my Dad drives into Astoria to take me out to dinner.<br /><br />We had become addicted to Emilio&#039;s cooking at Hellgate and were really sad to hear that the &quot;kitchen is under renovation&quot;.<br /><br />Some of the locals mentioned that the owner of Hellgate didn&#039;t treat Emilio very fair and let the business fall into disarray.<br /><br />The health department closed the kitchen because of violations, which is truly sad because Emilio really put his heart into every delicious meal he&#039;s prepared for us. <br /><br />Does anyone have any suggestions on how Hellgate&#039;s kitchen can get back up and running?<br />Perhaps there is a better suggestion as to another establishment Emilio can bring his culinary talent and be treated well?<br /><br />Either way, my Dad is really bummed that he&#039;s not having Emilio&#039;s Eggplant Parm tonight for dinner...<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				One look at that kitchen and it&#039;s no surprise at all what happened.&nbsp; But you&#039;re right about his talents and his food.&nbsp; Each dish more delicious than the next.&nbsp; And the nicest guy in the world.&nbsp; I think the kitchen would require an enlargement and a gut renovation.&nbsp; But there is wasted space in the dining room that could absorb that.&nbsp; They should keep the bar open with a path to the patio and restrooms and plastic-wall off the left side and start the work.

				Just to be clear, I agree on hime being super clean.&nbsp; I just thought it was too small to be up to code.&nbsp; I have a better range in my apartment.&nbsp; The refrigerator is out back.&nbsp; Etc.&nbsp; I just thought if they planned to renovate to keep the dinner business going, that it was doable.

				Quality of stove/oven doesn&#039;t have to do with DOH code. Walk-ins in the back yard are allowed if they are grandfathered in.<br /><br /><br />I don&#039;t understand. The DOH website says they have gotten down to only 2 points.

				Oh s___!<br />&nbsp;<br />I have gone twice in recent months and seen that they are under rennovation, but I thought they were ACTUALLY under rennovation and were opening again soon.<br />&nbsp;<br />Are you guys saying that they are closed permanently, and that Emilio is out for good?<br />&nbsp;<br />This is my favorite restaurant in Astoria, and I would be reduced to tears and peeing myself if the kitchen was closed forever. Anyone have concrete word on this?&nbsp; :embarrassed:

				An absolute disgrace if this is true.<br />&nbsp;<br />The people there are very nice, but lets be honest- its a poopie dive bar. What drove me, and all my friends to go there was the top notch Italian food. The buzz had been created, and I feel like they were a big time underground Astorian restaurant. Any time I had visitors I took them to this place to have Emilio&#039;s cooking.<br />&nbsp;<br />What the hell are they thinking getting rid of this? It&#039;s not just a great meal- its a staple of the Ditmars area.<br />&nbsp;<br />Boooooooooo!!!!!!!!

				so, I&#039;ve heard that they&#039;re negotiating to try to bring Emilio back 1x a week or so to cook - something like &#039;EMILIO NIGHT&#039;.&nbsp; Fingers crossed it actually happens and if they do some decent advertising, I&#039;m sure they&#039;d be packed.&nbsp;

				I have actually heard the same! My wife ran into the waitress there, and supposedly they will try to have Thursday night (possibly) be Italian night with Emilio.<br />&nbsp;<br />Fingers crossed indeed- I am still in withdrawal from not having the chicken franchese there.
