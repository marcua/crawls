				Personally I believe 2 1/2 years for outing a CIA agent seems lenient. On the other hand, he was just doing Cheney&#039;s bidding, so the justice is only being partially served.

Libby wasn&#039;t convicted&nbsp; of outing anyone, there was nobody&nbsp; to &#039;out?&#039;&nbsp; Armitage&nbsp; dropped&nbsp; the name , already known to many in the press.&nbsp; Cheney had&nbsp; zero to do with it. But, let&#039;s not let facts get in the way of hating the Republicans, it&#039;s&nbsp; a NYC tradition.

				This really has nothing to do with &#039;hating Republicans&#039;.&nbsp; Wake up man!&nbsp; Your party has been hijacked.&nbsp; You need to get out there and fight for your party.&nbsp; It is NOT the party of Lincoln and Eisenhower any longer.&nbsp; This is no longer the party of fiscal responsibility or &#039;compassionate conservatism&#039;.&nbsp; This is the party that is spending so much in our lifetimes, it will take generations to pay for it, it is the party of HATE - hate of gays.&nbsp; It is the party of hypocrisy, as in the Republicans that I know who cheat on their wives while claiming that gay marriage would threaten the sanctity of marriage.&nbsp; It is the party that wants to take away the rights of a woman&#039;s right to choose.&nbsp; It is the party that no longer respects the separation of Church and State - they bring religion into everything.&nbsp; It is the party that no longer respects privacy.&nbsp; It is the party of scandal, over and over again, and I do not need to mention all the stuff that came out this past year.&nbsp; What I am telling you is that you should get out and fight for your party before it goes so far to the right that you will no longer recognize it!&nbsp; We need all parties in this country, we need more than the two we currently have.&nbsp; I implore all moderate Republicans to get your party back from the extreme right, Christian Neocons who have taken over!!!

Also, why is it that you assume that only Muslims blow themselves up? Look at Timothy McVeigh, or others of his ilk, who by the way are/were Bush supporters. And why do you put gay marriage in quotes? Is it because you don&#039;t consider it to be real love? SHEESH!! Now that&#039;s &quot;yelling&quot;!! Wow I sound like Andy Rooney! :mrgreen: :mrgreen: :mrgreen:
