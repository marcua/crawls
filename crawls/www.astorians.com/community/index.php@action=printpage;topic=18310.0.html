				http://www.holtonfarms.com/how-to-buy/farm-truck/<br /><br />Well, this is an interesting concept - Holton Farms in Vermont will be parking their new Farm Truck at Steinway and 35th Ave from 9-10 AM on Sundays.<br /><br />They have a CSA option, but are also planning to have a retail option for &quot;a la carte&quot; purchases.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m excited about this - I liked the concept of the CSA but it didn&#039;t really fit my lifestyle when I tried.&nbsp; I always had too much leftover produce, even after splitting my share with friends.&nbsp; And outside of the local CSAs, finding super-fresh fruits and veggies in this area of Astoria (near Steinway/35th Ave) is a challenge, given how much trucking is involved in getting it into our grocery stores.&nbsp; There&#039;s the Union Square Greenmarket, but it&#039;s still a trek to lug everything home from there, even as a straight shot on the N/W train.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sunday mornings are early, but... this could be worth it.

				The Holton Farms program will run from May 17 until November 21, bringing seasonal produce to the city each week at various drop-off locations (http://www.holtonfarms.com/map/). Although the season started May 17, you can sign up anytime you want as they do not have a cap on membership and your membership is YOUR money to spend as you see fit. Holton Farms is very excited about the program and think it&#039;ll encourage New Yorkers to cook great meals at home with fresh ingredients. More details, including the pricing plans, can be found on their website: http://www.holtonfarms.com/how-to-buy/csa-select/<br /><br />They have an Astoria drop off on Sunday mornings and daily drop offs throughout Manhattan throughout the week.
