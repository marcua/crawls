				I had been wanting to go back to Kabab Cafe since Ali had returned from Spain.&nbsp; I have never had a bad meal there but Ali did seem to be a little tired prior to his vacation and the food seemed to suffer.&nbsp; <br /><br />Well, I am very glad that he took a break because his food is back to the excellent level.&nbsp; He has new items on the &quot;menu&quot; and his spark seemed to be back.&nbsp; <br /><br />Last weekend we had an exceptional meal at Kabab Cafe.&nbsp; Ali always treats us like old friends and it is nice to be welcomed like that to any restaurant.&nbsp; He seems to have many loyal followers. <br /><br />Anyway, he had a new appetizer that was fantastic.&nbsp; It was a duck ragu over a rice dumpling.&nbsp; The rice dumpling had a date mashed in the middle of it.&nbsp; This dish was very very tasty.&nbsp; Other standouts was an entree of shredded lamb over rice and roasted vegetables but that description doesn&#039;t really do it justice.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have not seen Kabab Cafe mentioned here recently and I wanted to keep Ali top of mind as a true Astoria treasure.&nbsp; He also said that he will be introducing several new duck dishes as he is shooting a new show with Jamie Oliver...

				I always walk by this place wondering what it is. <br /><br />Just watched their episode on YouTube<br /><br />&quot;On the New York City edition of &quot;No Reservations,&quot; Anthony Bourdain and Andrew Zimmern visit Ali El Sayed&#039;s famous Kabab Cafe on Steinway Street in Astoria, Queens, for a meal of sweetbreads, a puff at the hookah, and some chat about food and world politics. Ali upstages both of them demonstrates why he&#039;s known as the &quot;Mayor of Astoria.&quot; &quot;<br /><br />Check it out<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBFDvyi6p64 (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBFDvyi6p64)<br /><br />I&#039;ll have to go there!

				my friends took me for my birthday, and it made me wish I could afford to eat there every day.&nbsp; Every meal I&#039;ve ever had at Kabab Cafe has been mind blowingly good.
