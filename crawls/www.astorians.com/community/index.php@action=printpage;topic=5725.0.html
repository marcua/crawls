				Just wondering if there are any cycling groups in the area.&nbsp; I&#039;m a recreational rider, I try and do the 5 boro tour every spring, and just generally enjoy riding my bike and the view of the city that you get when you&#039;re riding.&nbsp; <br />There are few things as cool as hearing a salsa band practicing when you&#039;re riding over the pulaski bridge at night, with Manhattan all lit up to your left.&nbsp; <br />I need to get out of work today and get on my bike...

				I don not know of any local groups, but if one is formed, I&#039;m in.<br /><br />Though it might not be a five borough tour, I like biking down through the stringy streets of Brooklyn to Neptune Avenue and grabbing me a nathan hot dog

				28G, that sounds like a cool route. I&#039;d also like to try that tour they give up the Old Croton Aqueduct someday.<br /><br />When is the Blessing of the Bikes? I plan on leading a ride from Astoria Park to St. John the Divine that morning. Rained out last year&nbsp; :-P bah.<br /><br />May 19th is the ribbon cutting of the Highbridge Park dirt jumps/pump track/ bike trails.&nbsp; :lol: Cunningham Park trails (officially) open the week after.&nbsp; :mrgreen: Some pictures: http://upload.pbase.com/dirtrock/highbridge_project <br /><br />I missed the last couple of T.A. meetings :| but haven&#039;t given up on the Queens contingent!

				I generally only wear a helmut on my scooter (and usually only when riding one in the U.S., europe is lenient on it)<br /><br />The trails where I grew up on long island are policed for helmuts, I dont know what it is like round here, and although I know you should wear one, I don&#039;t, nor do I like it...<br /><br />Anyone ever get a ticket...<br /><br />And is that finally it for the snow?

				I don&#039;t think it is against the law to not wear your helmet on a bike if you are over a certain age (14 I think).&nbsp; So you can&#039;t get a ticket fo that.&nbsp; You do need front and back lights, stay off the sidewalk if your wheels are bigger than a certain size (kids wheels) and you have to have a bell... which I never understood why you need a bell but not a helmet.&nbsp; Oh well.<br /><br />No more snow?&nbsp; At least until it suddenly snows in June.

				<br />Hi there... I need bike advice. I&#039;m moving to Astoria in a bit and need to figure out whether to bring my road bike.&nbsp; It&#039;s not the kind with super thin tires, but has drop handlebars and the body position is best for air dynamics, not visibility. Is this a good idea for biking in an urban setting (coming from the corn and soybean fields over here...). Or should I leave it behind and get a hybrid once in New York?<br /><br />I thought it&#039;d be neat to do the 5-borough tour as one of my first activities in New York. When I lived in Paris I did the rollerblading rides on Fridays and Sundays, same idea, except they do it weekly.<br /><br />

				Personally I like to sit up so I can see traffic and stuff.&nbsp; I have a harder time doing that when I&#039;m hunched down, although it does make the trip go quicker.&nbsp; Couldn&#039;t you get new handlebars and switch out the old ones if you want to keep you bike?

				It&#039;s an idea. These last days are hectic, I&#039;ll see if I can squeeze my trusty hippy bike mechanic in. Unfortunately, he almost requires that you stay in the shop while he works on the bike. Or i guess I could bring it as is and then take it to one of the bike shops to get the handle bars swapped...

				I like to be able to look up at the traffic as well.&nbsp; Feels alot better on the back after a long go of it and I feel that drivers have a better awareness of me (private rant: the awareness levels of bikers in Europe is so much higher than it is around here.&nbsp; Hate that!)<br /><br />I have hybrid tires and they are perfect for NYC.&nbsp; Even going off roading around here, like around central park or over the pot holed roads of the industrial areas, the hybrid tires are fine, though I suppose mountain bike tires would be good if you plan on doing any of it upstate/

				hi all<br /><br />christine - thanks for those links.<br /><br />in re-reading this thread (i have no interest in working at work today so i&#039;m making myself look busy by staring intently at my computer) it seems like a handful of people are interested in forming a local cycling group.&nbsp; i&#039;m happy to take the lead on organizing it (it&#039;ll keep me looking busy). <br /><br />so those who are interested, PM me or repost - if you want to be really hyperorganized, maybe send good/bad availability, skill level, and route interests (i am really wasting time at work ...).&nbsp; i don&#039;t have too many creative routes in mind, but will do that research while eagerly awaiting responses.&nbsp; <br /><br />here&#039;s my availability: evenings after 6pm; weekend days; i&#039;m middle-skilled (no speed demon, but can hold my own for many, many miles); would love to do trail/nature riding, but mostly am interested in just being on the bike.<br /><br />thanks folks - look forward to meeting up and riding around!<br />

				ATB, if you&#039;re serious about starting a local cycling group, I&#039;d definitely be in.&nbsp; I&#039;m usually available after 7 during the week and pretty much any time during the weekend.&nbsp; During the week, when I get out, I usually just ride into Central Park and do laps there, but I love long weekend rides to Coney Island, Flushing Meadows Park.&nbsp; As for speed, at one point I was averaging about 15 mph, but now I&#039;m back down to around 10-12.&nbsp; If you need any help with riding routes or anything feel free to let me know.&nbsp; Also, if we wanted to get all official, let me know, as I have the ability to design and print shirts.&nbsp;

				i&#039;m definitely serious - i think it could be a lot of fun.&nbsp; i just got back from walking my dog in astoria park and was pondering whether any of the riders i saw were people on this list.&nbsp; a few people have PM&#039;d me with interest - keep it coming, folks!&nbsp; no pressure, just a good time on the bike. <br /><br />maybe we could do a starter-ride next sunday - i&#039;ll keep an eye on&nbsp; the weather and brainstorm some routes this week.&nbsp; any ideas, any input is more than welcome.&nbsp; KidMurdock, i could definitely use route ideas - i have spent most of this good weather riding to work rather than riding for fun.&nbsp; Someone suggested Forest Park for trail riding; there&#039;s also Alley Pond Park, but not sure how easy it is to get there.<br /><br />thanks for all the interest and excellent brainstorming thus far.&nbsp; now i just need to figure out how to put a side-car on my bike and find a dog helmet so i can bring my dog along!

				ATB, I was in the park this morning and wondered the same thing! Only I was sitting in my car&nbsp; :oops: listening to Car Talk and eating breakfast while enjoying the view. That tour group came by and I eavesdropped a little (I didn&#039;t know the Hell Gate Bridge was larger than its fraternal twin in Sydney! How about that.)<br /><br />Anyway, went to the Sports Authority where I test-rode a Diamondback Century bike all over the department. For anybody looking for a decent commuter bike, this was marked down to $350 from $600 or so. Small size (I&#039;m 5&#039; 6&quot; and thought it fit pretty well) with flat bars and road geometry. <br /><br />Verrrrry tempting.......I&#039;m looking for a long-distance touring bike w/o those annoying drop bars. But I think I want something more sturdy; this is a good all-around city commuter, the purchase of which I can&#039;t justify since my old mtb is so similar and already serves that purpose&nbsp; :| I like the shorter cockpit on that one, though.

				I have a question and I figured this would be the group of people to ask.&nbsp; I recently bought a mountain bike after not having owned a bike or even biked for the past 10 years.&nbsp; Last I owned was a crappy little 10 speed.&nbsp; Now could someone explain the 21 gears on a mountain bike.&nbsp; I feel comfortable in a certain gear but then I see people biking next to me whizzing by with what seems to be alot less effort.&nbsp; Maybe I&#039;m still out of shape, but I stick in the same gear for almost the entire ride and was wondering if I could utilize it better even though I&#039;m using it as a road bike through traffic.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks

				alas, the 5-boro ... i forgot about that.&nbsp; <br /><br />maybe those of us not doing the 5-boro can meet up for a ride - astoria park, roosevelt island, maybe central park depending on the time, and a possible beverage at beer garden afterwards?<br /><br />then, the following weekend, when the legs feel better and the sunburns are faded from the 5-boro folks, we can do something larger?<br /><br />i&#039;ve heard from a fair number of people both on this thread and in PMs - we could really get a good group together. <br /><br />so who&#039;s in for next sunday?<br /><br />ps: Sabeers, here&#039;s my 2-cents on gear shifting, tho i&#039;m no lance armstrong: staying in the same gear just gives you a lot more work to do.&nbsp; what i&#039;ve been taught is that irrespective of terrain, you want your legs moving as steadily as possible (knowing that you&#039;ll obviously work harder on uphill and less hard on downhill ... it&#039;s just a general idea) - so, switch the rear gears (right gear shift) in order to keep a fair tension on your legs.&nbsp; just takes practice and often, a lot of unecessary peddling till you get a good rhythm.&nbsp; and there&#039;s something&nbsp; to be said for that cliche about riding a bike ... it&#039;ll all come back to you!

				Let&#039;s see if I can explain.......<br /><br />Here&#039;s how I do it: Left = Front, Right = Rear. <br /><br />Meaning, the brake and shifter controlled by your left hand is for the front brake and the three cogs between the pedals. The right hand controls the rear brake and those 7 gears in the back.<br /><br />By shifting with the left hand, you can choose from those three front cogs:<br /><br />Big ring = flat terrain, going fast (more rotations of the tire per pedal)<br />Middle ring = gradual hill, moderate speed<br />Small ring = steep hill (gotta pedal fast just to stay upright!)<br /><br />Those are easy. The rear ones work in the same way (the bigger ones make you go faster.) Think of the rear ones as fine-tuning the front ones. For example, when you want to go balls-out fastest possible, biggest cog in front and biggest cog in back. <br /><br />Want to go pretty fast but not too crazy? Use your right hand to shift to a smaller cog .<br /><br />See a hill coming up while you&#039;re going fast? Use your left hand to quickly shift to the middle ring as you get to the base of it.<br /><br />Review: Left hand/front three cogs = Fast/medium/slow (instant speed change); Right hand/rear seven cogs = fine tuning the fast/medium/slow speed you&#039;re comfortable with.<br /><br />As for the brakes: <br /><br />Front brake has more power BUT if you grab just the left brake while going fast, you&#039;ll tumble over the bars. So it&#039;s best to &quot;feather&quot; the brakes (squeeze gently then let go over and over in quick succession.) <br /><br />When going downhill and you need to brake or slow down, put more pressure on the rear brake (right hand) than the front (left hand) and get your butt off the back of the seat. Don&#039;t be afraid to stand in your pedals (3 o&#039;clock and 9 o&#039;clock positions) while absorbing shock with your knees as you do this. <br /><br />Hope this helps!

				<em>staying in the same gear just gives you a lot more work to do.&nbsp; what i&#039;ve been taught is that irrespective of terrain, you want your legs moving as steadily as possible </em> <br /><br />I think the rule of thumb is somewhere in the range of 50-70 pedal rotations per minute. Of course people have their own preferences, but this helps if you&#039;re wondering if you&#039;re pedaling too fast or too slow.

				Astoria &gt; Flushing Meadow &gt; Astoria &gt; Crescent &amp; Vine recap:<br /><br />It was a great, relaxng ride and probably the perfect weather for one. Three of us ended up riding, following the Ditmars &gt; 23rd Ave &gt; Ditmars route to the Promenade then cutting through the Shea Stadium parking lot to Flushing Meadow and Corona Park. While there&#039;s no dedicated bike lane and a few MTA busses nearly clipped us it&#039;s definitely doable for just about any level of rider.&nbsp; We finished the ride with an ice-cold reward of Lagunitas Pils at the styling-new Crescent &amp; Vine.

				Roosevelt Island is a breeze, albeit a bit weird entering the island via a parking garage. I do the ride to and around the island, then take the tram to Manhattan (which is bike friendly) and then ride around the park once before taking the Queensboro back to Astoria. It&#039;s a good solid ride with some great views of the city.

				I&#039;ve since figured out the way through the Kissena Corridor (Flushing Meadows park to Cunningham.) Roosevelt Island seems a little dull for a ride, I must admit....

				I&#039;d be up for that, C.<br /><br />I have a friend coming over this weekend and want to show him parts of Astoria/LIC but also get some good open stretches of riding in too. So I was thinking of combining Roosevelt Island with our own shoreline up to ConEd. Any additional and/or better suggestions?

				Oh, well if somebody&#039;s looking for a tour, I&#039;d bypass Roosevelt Island and keep going to LIC instead, maybe stop at the Water Taxi beach and if they allow bikes, do the Taxi tour that way. But I&#039;m not sure they allow bikes though I think that would be way cool.....maybe Labor Day weekend they&#039;re not as busy and might allow it?

				Water taxi beach doesn&#039;t allow bikes in to the beach, but a lot of people do lock their bikes to the chain link fence right outside. The water taxis themselves *do* allow bikes, I think for no extra charge, so that&#039;s a great way to get in some riding and some sightseeing. ...Another option w/ out of town friends is to ride along the waterfront and then head over to greenpoint and williamsburg via the Pulaski bridge.

				I&#039;d give Roosevelt Island a B-. There is too much construction going on now, but I guess in a few years it will be great.<br /><br />So if anyone wants to do a ride in September, feel free to post. This is some of the best weather, let&#039;s take advantage of it.

				Did the water taxi thing yesterday: Rode to LIC, hopped on w/bike, got off at DUMBO and explored some of Brooklyn, which was great; back on and off @ Battery Park, rode up westside greenway to Hudson River Park, hung out on lawn and read, then back on and home around sunset. What a blast, and no extra charge for the bike&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				One of these days we should do a Water Taxi bike tour, hop off at each stop and hit some good stores/bars/restaurants. <br /><br />The concept of a culinary tour also seems popular, maybe start with a historical tour then a stop in Corona for empanadas/ices/pizza etc. Maybe incorporate the Kissena Corridor bike path if anybody&#039;s looking for something more ambitious.<br /><br />Or, a ride to Brooklyn via the Pulaski Bridge, now that I know a little bit about DUMBO (Junior&#039;s cheesecake place/Grimaldi&#039;s/Habana Outpost.) <br /><br />Each culinary bike tour would incorporate 1) entree 2) dessert 3) drinks or coffee :lol:

				I&#039;m down for a ride any weekend from here forth.&nbsp; Been riding to work and back lately.&nbsp; Just got home in fact.&nbsp; 30ave N/W stop to West Village 1 train Houston stop.&nbsp; Nice loooooooong ride.<br /><br />Inspite of the construction in Roosevelt Island, I still really really like riding there.&nbsp; It&#039;s so quiet.&nbsp; The lighthouse is nice and breezy.&nbsp; And the Spiderman I Castle is so surreal.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t done Randall&#039;s Island yet but if there&#039;s a way there&#039;s a will!

				Randall&#039;s Island/Ward&#039;s Island is actually very easy...I do it most mornings (at least 3 a week right now) in my commute to Harlem. At about 28th St on the North side of Astoria Blvd. there is a stair to the pedestrian bridgeway. It has a rail for pushing your bike up the stairs, but I find it easier to just pick up the bike &amp; climb. There are 2 of these easy stairs going up and 1 going down. It takes me about 7 minutes to cross the bridge to Randall&#039;s.<br /><br />I made the Astoria to W. Harlem (next to the Hudson) commute this morning in half an hour...much better than it was for the poor suckers on the M60 who were in one of the worst 125th Street traffic jams I&#039;ve seen.&nbsp; :-D

				Interested cyclists should consider joining TAWQ&#039;s google group at http://groups.google.com/group/TAWQ to keep up on our updates on cycling related news for Queens as well as rides we are putting together or just passing the word on for.&nbsp; We just had a ride from Astoria to the Far Rockaways last Sunday and we&#039;re having the trial TdQ ride Sat 11/17 (check out the info here http://groups.google.com/group/TAWQ/web/tdq)&nbsp; <br /><br />Not sure how many more rides we&#039;ll be having now that the weather is getting cold, but our goal starting next spring is to have at least 1 ride a month and possibly a ride a week in May, which is Bike Month.&nbsp; Best way to keep on top of all that is to join the google group.<br /><br />p.s. this is my 500th post w00t!!
