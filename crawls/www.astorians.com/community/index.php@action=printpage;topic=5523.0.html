				Bear with me here as I try and ask this question.&nbsp; In regards to the global warming debate, I get why the industries and therefore the politicians that represent them are fighting against it for at least the short term reasons of costs and legislation that will hurt them.&nbsp; What I don&#039;t get is what do these same people think the so called &quot;liberal radical left&quot; will get out of it? If they really think the left is making it all up, what is the reason?&nbsp; I am not asking for rhetoric here but some sort of real answer.<br /><br />I do know it is more than likely it is just their way of keeping the fight going but what do they claim the left has to win by creating the so called myth of global warming?&nbsp; What evil does Al Gore and company have planned according to Cheney and co.<br /><br />

				It&#039;s all about money. Profit. Shareholders. Big bucks. No-one really believes it is a myth. No-one sees it as a liberal, radical left-wing conspiracy anymore. It is just that the cost of doing business will go up in order to protect the earth. Money. Profit. Capitalism. Same word, different pronunciations. Disgusting.

				AFAIK, nothing sensible. I also wonder what it is the scientists are plotting in this version of the world. As a scientist, I&#039;m insulted not to have been invited to the conspiracy!<br /><br />This really is the problem, when you start thinking the propaganda through, it falls apart. <br /><br />

				I think NYCMU&#039;s got it. There&#039;s something about a concept that requires you to make major changes and threatens the way you see the world that is very, very hard to take in.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever heard anyone claim that liberals will get anything out of it, though.

				Really good question... I think the right sees the left as being anti-capitalism, anti-industry, and in the end, a bunch of hippies who want to live in the woods and eat nuts and berries. Being concerned about global warming is just an excuse to be against big oil and big multinational corporations. If there&#039;s no oil, thinks the right, there&#039;ll be no economic growth, no progress, and we&#039;ll all be poor, unwashed dope-heads.

				There was a very good program last night on HBO about global warming and they said something that made a lot of sense.<br /><br />The Federal government should be involved, give corporations incentives that if they&#039;re earth concious they will receive funds to help them achieve that goal but since it&#039;s NOT happening it should be up to the people and each individual State to do something and come together on this issue.<br /><br />Try to catch the show, it&#039;s excellent.

Personally I don&#039;t understand why everyone doesn&#039;t automatically want to try to conserve and be more energy efficient, but since they don&#039;t, that&#039;s when the government is supposed to step in and either make them want to or have to.

Who stands to gain from promoting the popular perception that government will save America/the world, not figuratively but literally, from polluting industry? From Islamic terrorists? From _(insert threat proposal)_? Politicians and bureaucrats and the industry of fund-raising lobbyists, special interest groups, and think tanks do. Want to raise money? Invoke a crisis. Want to stay in power? Take the side of dealing with a crisis and paint the opposition as unwilling and ill-equipped to address it.<br /><br />Now I&#039;ll speculate a little.<br /><br />On a simple, Darwinian level, strategists on the Right do not want to concede the (popularly perceived) moral highground on addressing an issue as emotionally charged as global climate crisis to the Left, because it renders election/reelection more difficult. <br /><br />On another level, some on the Right perceive that a significant number of proponents of anthropogenic global warming theory advocate increasing government control over the economy. This is nothing new. The institutional Left has always advocated increased government control of the economy, but now they&#039;re positioning themselves as saviors of the environment to do so. This certainly upsets the religious Right because they&#039;re not accustomed to being on the negative side of a moral contest; the &quot;god&quot; card may still reverberate in some debates, but it isn&#039;t the trump card in a debate over saving the world, which is a topic with the oomph needed to upstage the debates the Right wants people to focus on. <br /><br />Finally, there certainly are folks on the Right who grasp that increased taxes and fees and regulations will have a variety of effects-- increased prices for consumers, job losses, disincentives to start new businesses or to keep them in America-- considered by them far worse than the effects some attribute to global warming. <br /><br />***<br /><br />Speaking for myself, regarding the global warming debate, there is a distinction worth noting between the science of climatology, on the one hand, and, on several other hands, the presentations of the science of climatology (1) by politicians seeking re-election, (2) by bureaucrats seeking increased budget allocations, (3) by leftist and right-wing special interest groups raising money using the issue of global warming, and (4) by scientists seeking new or increased funding for their research from the government. <br /><br />The science is far less conclusive than the presenters of the science listed above, far less certain than most of the people who take sides on this issue on message boards like this one.<br /><br />Scientific propositions are different from political causes; they do not prevail because of a majority. Evolution is true because it accurately describes phenomena in the world. Global climate change is a reality, but I believe that we&#039;re still lacking accurate theories about the proportions of influence exerted by solar radiation, greenhouse gases (which may or may not be produced by humans in sufficient quantities to constitute &quot;the&quot; deciding factor in climate change), and other factors. The science isn&#039;t even conclusive about global warming being a net negative for human beings. <br /><br />Science is being polluted by &quot;intelligent design&quot; advocates on the religious right and by &quot;humans-are-the-primary-drivers-of-catastrophic-global-warming&quot; on the environmentalist left.<br /><br />I adopt a skeptical, &quot;first do no harm&quot; rule about public policy. So, before I would implement any public policy solutions based on athropogenic global warming theory (-ies), I&#039;d conduct a study designed to identify which of models upon which catastrophic predictions are based can reproduce accurate forecasts, not 100 years from now, but 2 years, 5 years, 10 years from now. And I&#039;d have such a study funded anonymously to keep the findings as impartial as possible. I&#039;d say this would be a good start.

Its nonsensical to say &#039;I believe the climate changes&#039;. We can show that. Are you instead trying to say &#039;I believe there is warming?&#039;. The factors of influence you list are a very few of the major complicating influences actually at work in any sophisticated model of change. This isn&#039;t easy to model - it just isn&#039;t, and its not going to be. There are too many feedback cycles, both positive (ie: increase warming) and negative, and a bunch of unknowns. But we have been crunching what data we have through supercomputers for nearly 50 years now. The models are getting better and better. For example, the 1980s model by Hansen et al. accurately predicted a significant amount of change over the past 20 something years - including accounting for major volcanic eruptions (1). <br /><br />I&#039;m not sure what &#039;conclusive&#039; science you would like to show you that warming might be a net negative for human beings. As temperatures rise, sea levels might also rise. Okay, maybe that&#039;s not a big deal - sea level rises are hard to predict accurately, and are very long term. But here&#039;s a taste of some of the rest of it. Water: rainfall patterns are shifting, in some areas quite dramatically (talk to Australia sometime). This means areas that have been the &#039;breadbaskets&#039; of the world are no longer necessarily going to be able to rely on rainfall to grow crops. Drinking water resevoirs are in places that also can predict their rainfall - when that stops, drinking water supplies to major metropolitan areas decline. Weeds and Disease: These are together because they&#039;re much the same - shifting climates mean expansions of species such as poison ivy, ragweed, mosquitos. More serious agricultural pests as well. Mosquitos are already on the move in many places, warming allows them to expand upwards, for instance. If you&#039;ve ever been in a malarial area, you&#039;ll know the cities and towns are often in the hills, away from the mosquitos - no more. West Nile and NYC anyone? And for the rest, well - some understanding of ecology would probably help. Humans are actually still part of the environment, no matter how urban and electronic your life might be. Changes to the flora and fauna outside of our cities will affect us as well. And then there&#039;s the ethical arguments - is it okay for us to drive even more of the world&#039;s species to extinction? <br /><br />Finally, we can show on any scale you like (geological history, recorded history) that CO2 (the major anthropogenic greenouse gas, although methane and water vapour are also important) is linked to changes in temperature. We can even measure about how much CO2 has been around at various times, including post-industrial revolution vs. geological history. And guess what? every time there&#039;s a ton of it around, the earth gets warmer. That&#039;s simple enough for everyone to understand. Fact 2: we&#039;ve put a whole lot of CO2 out there - and yes it is significant. Whaddya think is going to happen? can you add two and two? And what the hell is the problem with cutting down on what we&#039;re putting out there? I really don&#039;t get why this is so hard to do. Change technologies - we do it all the time. Government incentives rather than regulation, if you&#039;re really that concerned about it (and America always seems to be - but the rest of the world gets along just fine without this attitude). We could actually end up growing the economy quite significantly! let&#039;s have some foward thinking and innovation! isnt that what this country is supposed to be great for? let&#039;s go!! <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">So, before I would implement any public policy solutions based on athropogenic global warming theory (-ies), I&#039;d conduct a study designed to identify which of models upon which catastrophic predictions are based can reproduce accurate forecasts, not 100 years from now, but 2 years, 5 years, 10 years from now.

Just because now is the moment that its good enough to take to the politicians and say okay, now ACT doesn&#039;t mean that we haven&#039;t effing thought about this. To turn around and say &#039;oh but its not good enough because you didn&#039;t predict that on Jan 12, 2007 the temperature would be 35 degrees&#039; is the most insane s___ I&#039;ve heard in a while (and I routinely deal with creationists). I also take umbrage at this implied notion that scientists simply give the answers their funding agencies want. Firstly, there are many and varied sources of funding, secondly the ONLY situations in which any of that has been shown to be going on is where agencies such as NASA are gagging their own climate scientists at the behest of this current administration. In fact, they&#039;ve done it again just recently - now no one on their payroll is allowed to mention polar bears ffs. <br /><br />1. Hansen, J., Sato, M., Ruedy, R. Lo, K.

				Melee knocked it out of the park. I would just add one thing. Of course there&#039;s uncertainly about this. But the worst-case scenarios are so bad, in terms of crop changes, disease, refugees, etc., that even a small chance of it happening is unacceptably risky. Better to spend a little money now to be fairly confident that the worst-case scenario doesn&#039;t happen then to risk that worst-case.

Concerning the validity of a claim, consensus is irrelevant.<br /><br />&quot;Intelligent Design loses to evolution&quot; because there is a fact-based reality and those of us who choose to focus on and respect facts must come to this conlcusion. Evolution is a good theory regardless of how many people see it as such.<br /><br />Anthropogenic catastrophic global warming theory, on the other hand, does not enjoy nearly as exalted a status as evolution. Because it hasn&#039;t earned that status. <br /><br />The challenge before advocates of this theory is to demonstrate that in addition to those climate changes which would happen naturally, human activity influences the climate to such an extent (primarily by our carbon emissions and deforestation) that a climate crisis will result that would not otherwise occur. Therefore, humans must change their behavior in ways that can be (have been) calculated to avert otherwise inevitable climate-based disasters.<br /><br />This theory is not evidence-based. It is, in fact, a model-driven forecast. There are certainly correlations between anthropogenic carbon emissions and global warming, but the extent of causality is a subject of significant dispute among respected scientists. Reading the Wikipedia entry on global warming is instructive. There are many competing theories, many variables that merit further study. A reasonable human being can look at this issue and surmise that it is significantly unsettled. The proposition that human beings are producing global warming that will result in a &quot;climate crisis&quot; is an assertion, not a verified scientific theory. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=5523.msg61646.html#msg61646">Quote from: Melee on March 13, 2007, 02:14:04 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> Same deal here.

During that time, most human problems were a direct and indirect result of violent governments. Exceptional loss of life due to statist regimes aside, it was a century that saw per capita improvements on virtually every major category: longevity, health, productivity, and wealth increased measurably all over the world. <br /><br />Even though the Earth warmed by approximately 0.6 degrees Celsius, people at the end of the century were living longer, healthier lives with more leisure time and more real income than their counterparts 100 years prior. <br />&nbsp; <br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=5523.msg61646.html#msg61646">Quote from: Melee on March 13, 2007, 02:14:04 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> <br />As temperatures rise, sea levels might also rise. Okay, maybe that&#039;s not a big deal - sea level rises are hard to predict accurately, and are very long term. But here&#039;s a taste of some of the rest of it. Water: rainfall patterns are shifting, in some areas quite dramatically (talk to Australia sometime). This means areas that have been the &#039;breadbaskets&#039; of the world are no longer necessarily going to be able to rely on rainfall to grow crops. Drinking water resevoirs are in places that also can predict their rainfall - when that stops, drinking water supplies to major metropolitan areas decline. Weeds and Disease: These are together because they&#039;re much the same - shifting climates mean expansions of species such as poison ivy, ragweed, mosquitos. More serious agricultural pests as well. Mosquitos are already on the move in many places, warming allows them to expand upwards, for instance. If you&#039;ve ever been in a malarial area, you&#039;ll know the cities and towns are often in the hills, away from the mosquitos - no more. West Nile and NYC anyone? And for the rest, well - some understanding of ecology would probably help. Humans are actually still part of the environment, no matter how urban and electronic your life might be. Changes to the flora and fauna outside of our cities will affect us as well.&nbsp; &nbsp;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No amount of reducing anthropogenic carbon emissions is going to relieve us from responsibility for adapting to a climate that, as a brute fact of reality, is going to change continually in ways that will require us to adapt. Shall we look to government or entrepreneurs for inspiration?<br /><br />One question worth considering is: should humans attempt to slow global warming by reducing their emissions *without any guarantee that doing so will produce desirable results*? Here&#039;s another question: Do we really believe that humans can set and maintain a temperature range on this planet that will be optimal for human civilization to thrive? Another question we might consider is this: In what ways can and should human beings maximize their adaptability to climate change... to change in general? <br /><br />On a separate note, with all due respect, in light of the problems facing humanity today and our scarce resources, we have to prioritize. People are suffering and dying all over the world because men with guns are forcing them to lead lives without access to food, capital, the rule of law, private property, economic opportunities... and we&#039;re talking about the poison ivy, mosquitoes, rainfall patterns in decades to come.... here&#039;s where I&#039;m coming from. <br /><br />Where people are starving today, they should be able to buy Perrier, prosciutto, and pumpernickel, but they can&#039;t. Why? No protection of individual liberty. No opportunities to create wealth. No electricity or running water. Having seen these situations with my own eyes, I can tell you, global warming is an overweighted priority in the developed world because only there do they have the luxury of contemplating the future inconveniences of changing weather patterns and warmer temperatures.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=5523.msg61646.html#msg61646">Quote from: Melee on March 13, 2007, 02:14:04 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> <br />And then there&#039;s the ethical arguments - is it okay for us to drive even more of the world&#039;s species to extinction? </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The absence of private property is, in fact, a primary enabler of pollution (the commons is abused because there is no proprietor who cares about ensuring that it is protected... just look at Steinway Street, and then look at your apartment).

You may find this analogy to be overly severe, but I would liken that to piling a bunch of people onto a rescue boat until the whole thing sinks, which helps no one. Various other analogies would fit, like something about having to build stronger supports for taller buildings or needing a really sturdy table if you&#039;re going to put some really heavy stuff on it. The argument here is for sustainability.<br /><br />However, certainly there&#039;s enough money being wasted by our government today that a sizable investment in environmental protection wouldn&#039;t have to starve all other causes. We&#039;ve already spent close to a trillion dollars, if not more, in Iraq and we still don&#039;t seem short of money to waste. Though I guess that depends on how you view the national debt.

You may find this analogy to be overly severe, but I would liken that to piling a bunch of people onto a rescue boat until the whole thing sinks, which helps no one. <br />Various other analogies would fit, like something about having to build stronger supports for taller buildings or needing a really sturdy table if you&#039;re going to put some really heavy stuff on it.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />&nbsp;&quot;...developing things to help preserve the environment....&quot; <br /><br />Your premise is that if human beings don&#039;t specifically focus on reducing carbon emissions, the emissions amounts will reach a point at which the Earth will become, essentially, uninhabitable. <br /><br />What if your premise is wrong? In the way, for example, that a resident of NYC in 1900 would be wrong to predict that the city would be impossible to live in 50 years into the future because of the piles of horseshit all over the place. They didn&#039;t anticipate disruptive technology shift called the automobile and the assembly line. In the way, for example, that people are wrong when they make any fine predictions about the future based on a frame of reference that cannot adequately account for the unpredictable, spontaneous nature of human beings. Or in the way that giving the government control over our adaptability to climate change may just completely backfire?<br /><br />Would you have predicted the end of the Soviet Union, how and when it occured? The personal computer, more specifically the GUI of the Mac? Wireless phones making international calls? Health food stores? <br /><br />Sustainability is unpredictable because we are. What we think is impossible today may be common tomorrow. What sustained humanity once upon a time would be insufficient today... you get the idea.<br /><br />I was born in the seventies when many prospective parents, including friends of my parents, were admonished by the scientific establishment about inevitable overpopulation that would result in hundreds of millions, even billions of people dying of starvation, not in some distant future, but in the 1980s and 1990s. The thing is, not only was the overpopulation mantra wrong, it was profoundly wrong. Not only was population growth not linear in wealthy nations, as had been projected, but innovators like Norman Borlaug made it possible for billions of people to avoid malnutrition and thrive. Yet people really believed in overpopulation. <br /><br />This idea that people living in the developing world will end up with all of the benefits of modern life that we currently enjoy, but it will be all for naught because of the impact of anthropogenic carbon emissions is not descriptive, is not scientifically derived, it&#039;s based on models. Models that can&#039;t account for social change, new technologies, etc. <br /><br />Human beings throughout recorded history have had to adapt to changing conditions. It&#039;s what we do. Especially insofar as it has been used to argue, as many have, that the developing world should not be allowed access to economic development opportunities, this is a pernicious idea: one implicit assertion is that the risk of economic prosperity and enhanced longevity is that it will overburden the Earth. I&#039;m not saying that&#039;s yours or anyone on this board&#039;s assertion, but I have heard this set forth as a rationale for slowing economic development and I find it deplorably inhumane.<br /><br />Humanity&#039;s best chance for enhanced longevity and prosperity on this planet comes from our ingenuity. What drives ingenuity is a process of adaptation in the face of challenges and a process of dynamic discovery based on trial and error, profits and losses, experimentation. <br /><br />If there was ever the possibility of a man-made black hole for human life, liberty and wealth, it would be a government program tasked with controlling the Earth&#039;s climate. Would there ever be a big enough budget, enough interventionist power for such an endeavor? <br />&nbsp;<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=5523.msg61769.html#msg61769">Quote from: essen on March 14, 2007, 02:23:41 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The argument here is for sustainability.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Sustainability... who would argue against that? Not me. <br /><br />What happens when a scarce resource is declared a commons? Like Chilean Sea Bass? Like medical professionals? Like forests? They get used up to extinction because nobody has a vested interest in preserving the resource. In fact, the self-interest of a person with access to a resource he/she knows everybody else has access to is to take as much of it as possible, more than he or she needs, because (1) he/she knows everybody else will do the same thing and (2) because waste has no cost. In economics, this is known as the tragedy of the commons. On the other hand, ownership incentivizes stewardship, which is sustainability-plus. People take care of what they own and crap all over what nobody owns.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sustainability has to be profit driven. Has nothing to do with taking a LEFT or RIGHT stand on the issue. Why do lumber companies plant trees? Because they want to ensure future revenue. Why do the fishermen in Iceland not have the fish shortages suffered in Chile? Because each of them privately owns the right to fish between specific coordinates, so they do so in a manner that doesn&#039;t destroy their ability to make profits over time.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;d love to see an end to sweetheart deals between businesses and governments whereby companies relocate to a state that promises eminent domain taking of the company&#039;s preferred destination, extraordinary tax-deferments and pollution without consequences. I see privatization of&nbsp; property as a check on pollution without consequences, at the very least. Private property owners tend to be less tolerant of pollution than are governments. Ideally, I&#039;d like a separation of economy and state whereby it is a criminal act for politicians and/or individuals/businesses to seek advantages and/or wealth (corporate welfare, loopholes, etc.)&nbsp; ... but that&#039;s probably best saved for another thread.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=5523.msg61769.html#msg61769">Quote from: essen on March 14, 2007, 02:23:41 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">However, certainly there&#039;s enough money being wasted by our government today that a sizable investment in environmental protection wouldn&#039;t have to starve all other causes.

And now the pendulum is swinging hard towards a new kind of centrist national socialism, supported jointly by Democrats and Republicans, in which the winners are politicians, bureaucrats, big businesses, big special interest groups, and the losers are individual citizens making less than $100,000, small businesses, and entrepreneurs. The primary effect of &quot;a sizable investment in environmental protection&quot; by our government will enrich and empower the aforementioned winners at the expense of the aforementioned losers.<br /><br />Trusting government to do anything consistently and efficiently and smartly and morally is absofuckinglutely insane.

				Alright - I can&#039;t work out how to quote what&#039;s gone a long time before, so please forgive the format of this - it is a response to adamwc&#039;s response to my last post (with thanks to a colleague who also looked over this thread)! And I promise this is my last post on the subject - arguing on the internet is never my favourite way to spend time! <br /><br />Summary data on feedback cycles, temperature changes, CO2 emission factors etc. is available online via the IPCC, a deliberately conservative group put together by the UN to report back on the subject to the policy makers of the world: http://ipcc-wg1.ucar.edu/ (http://ipcc-wg1.ucar.edu/). I&#039;m not sure why its so hard to find? There&#039;s an entire issue of Nature on this too. Nature is the foremost scientific journal in the world, followed closely by Science and PNAS (in which the Hansen et al. article appeared) - none of these journals are difficult to find. <br /><br />Models are an entirely acceptable scientific method and a perfectly reasonable place from which to draw a scientific conclusion. They are slightly more sophisticated than The Sims. In this case, the models are being created by running them with past data to see if they can predict past history (ie: with the data from 1990, can you predict 1995?). They&#039;re (there are many research groups, working on a variety of models that tend to say essentially the same thing) very very good at this now. To go back to a previous metaphor, evolutionary models include artificial selection, from agricultural breeding to breeds of dogs and fruit-fly mutation experiments every undergraduate biology student has performed at some point - none of these have technically created new species, but they model the process of evolution very effectively. In a computerised setting, genetic design algorithims provide evidence for evolution - or would you not consider this suitably scientific either? <br /><br />The theory of evolution is better supported than global warming at this point - it has had 150 years to accumulate data. At this point, we have 50 or so years on GW - years in which all available evidence has been gathered and nothing yet has contradicted it. Much the same as evolution at its starting point. Its true that the ultimate test of this theory will be in the future, but we are seeing plenty of supporting evidence right now - in much the same way as selection experiments corroborate evolution. This theory explains all the available evidence and is not contradicted by any of it. That&#039;s called a good scientific theory (for theory/fact distinctions and scientific philosophy, may I suggest the talk.origins FAQ?). <br /><br />Scientific funding and success is rated by a number of measures that do a pretty good job of ensuring against fraud. Grant applications are anonymously peer reviewed, as are any manuscripts submitted for publication. This means other experts in your field are asked to review your work to determine its importance and accuracy. Remember that the important thing about science is that your results are replicable. Reviewers and other people working in your field will routinely be checking this. Frauds do get through occasionally - usually they are individuals and caught when someone tries to replicate the work. The idea that entire fields of science (and this theory covers a number of them - I, for instance, am a trained Zoologist and Geologist, but Physicists, Botanists, Astronomers, etc. etc. are involved in this) are combined in fraud is absolute nonsense - on a par with &quot;HIV doesn&#039;t cause AIDS&quot;. <br /><br />Finally to your politcal/policy points - as much as they continually shift, I&#039;ll try to address what was originally said in response to me. I wasn&#039;t aware we were discussing third world aid, but there are ways to combine the two interests. Say for example US foreign aid was used partially to create cleaner-burning fuels or power plants in a country like China, who are the second-biggest producer of greenhouse gases. European and US coal burning power plants operate on 33% efficiency. China&#039;s operate on 18%. By bringing them up to our standard, we would improve quality of life (these plants are also responsible for sulfurous air pollution and acid rain), china&#039;s poor get cheaper power AND we&#039;ve cut greenhouse gases. <br /><br />Other policy concerns of the right can also be addressed here - something that the Bush administration appears to have just cottoned on to. His South America tour is creating a new fuel line for the US via Brazil and other agreeable countries. Alternative energy generation, the ethanol that he&#039;s pushing, takes the bottom out of the economy of &#039;enemies&#039; of the US such as Chavez, not to mention the Arab oil nations who have the disturbing habit of producing so many terrorists and weighing US money down in costly wars. <br /><br />This shouldn&#039;t be a political issue - I&#039;m not really sure why it is, and I don&#039;t think this thread explained anything to me on that, except that people like to take sides, and bipartisan politics in this country is insane. Here: http://www.natcap.org/ (http://www.natcap.org/) is a book on how capitalism can profit, creating the &#039;next industrial revolution&#039; from this opportunity. <br /><br />None of us are saying we can control the climate. What we are saying is that things are getting warmer. A good deal of that is due to human activities - we are warming faster than at any other time in the world&#039;s history. We can slow it down at least, by changing our habits and avert a significant amount of human misery. Why is that such a disgusting idea? <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

				I am less savvy about this topic than just about everyone else that has posted, but what I have gleaned as the bottom line battle, and from what Adam has said, is, in the name of global warming, people (right or left, i don&#039;t care) are advocating funding to prevent something that they really have no evidence if it will work. The hypothesis is that it will work and that we can salvage some of the damage that has been done, and prevent more, but it IS something that only time will tell. It isn&#039;t like we have some evidence to the contrary. <br /><br />I get from what Adam is saying, why spend funds on something you aren&#039;t sure is going to work, when you know those same funds will definitely feed someone, provide medical care, and diminish pain and suffering, something we DO know will happen. I don&#039;t really see how this garners negativity. It is a very logical argument. <br /><br />The counter argument, that &quot;in the long term&quot; it will be worth it, has a couple of issues. We really don&#039;t know. We just don&#039;t. We HAVE to do it, spend the money to find out. The other issue is that we are making a judgement, that sacrificing funds (possibly lives) that could be used to provide aid now, is worth it. This is making a major judgement on the worth of life, and the sacrifice of life. <br /><br />This is what I took from the debate (in my un-educated regarding global warming opinion). I see the argument on both sides.

Again, there is (or at least should be) enough money in this country that we can spend it on various causes. It&#039;s also important to keep in mind that not all the world&#039;s problems can be solved by throwing money at them. We could throw hundreds of billions of dollars into trying to help Africa and see most of it go to waste; we don&#039;t <em>know</em> what would work there. Dealing with health care and education isn&#039;t as simple as building more hospitals and schools. There are a lot of human-based issues that we have about as little idea of how to deal with as we do with the environment. Again why I don&#039;t buy that argument.<br /><br />As for not knowing whether or not any of our efforts to help the environment will pay off, I&#039;m not sure how anyone would disagree with that idea. Even if it turns out humanity has no effect on global climate and we just happen to be living in the middle of a natural climate shift, does anyone really believe that all the chemicals we put into the air (and the water and the ground, for that matter) don&#039;t negatively affect the planet in some ways, and therefore negatively affects us? I guess it&#039;s only the idea of impending, apocalyptic doom that gets most people into action, but I don&#039;t know why people need to imagine entire countries engulfed by higher sea levels to want to do anything about it.

What preconditions?<br /><br />If people&#039;s private property rights are not recognized where they live, then they do not own their bodies, their homes and land, let alone the value of their work. So their bodies, the land they live on, the money they earn, all of that is taken from them, used without their consent, abused. If they have no rule of law in their society-- this is the idea that govt. is instituted and bound to protect its citizens&#039;&nbsp; liberty rights by upholding laws consistent with them-- then once they are deprived of liberty or land or wealth or life, they have no means of attaining justice. Private property rights, without a government to enforce them (the rule of law), remain the moral expectation of all people everywhere.&nbsp; <br /><br />How is this related to our general discussion?

				We live in the natural world. A significant aspect of our life experience is based on climate conditions, surely, not just where we live but all over the Earth.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have expressed my skepticism about the proposition that a catastrophist interpretation of anthropogenic global warming data is justified.&nbsp; However, I won&#039;t dispute the veracity of the greenhouse effect itself and I agree that, for a variety of reasons, a decreased reliance on fossil fuels makes good sense. We care about the climate because we have to adapt to the challenges and opportunities it presents in order to survive and thrive. This is a brute fact of our existence.<br /><br />We also live in a world of our own creation: human civilization. Our quality of life, even whether we live or die, is in large part dictated by an artificial context of rule structures, customs, social values, politicians, bureaucrats, markets.... basically, societies. Societies vary from place to place, obviously, but people, essentially, don&#039;t. We&#039;re all human beings, and though our particular cultures will and have varied over time, we are each of us entitled to respect for our private property rights via the rule of law (see previous post).<br /><br />What societies do human beings prefer? Leaving aside ideology, philosophy, -isms, and just considering flows of people (where people are leaving/where populations are falling/where people are going/where populations are increasing), there is a clearly expressed inclination in human history. People vote with their feet and most people want to live in societies based on private property and the rule of law. The only people with incentives to live in unfree societies are those with enough guns and power to monopolize wealth. Taken as a whole, all of the benefits of living in a place where the law primarily protects people from being coerced and defrauded and otherwise facilitates freely chosen peaceful behavior/activities constitute the reasons why people prefer free societies. They want the longer, healthier, and more prosperous lives that freer societies afford them better than less free societies.&nbsp; <br /><br />So, Jonathan, to address one key aspect of your question...&nbsp; <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=5523.msg62074.html#msg62074">Quote from: Jonathan on March 15, 2007, 03:12:16 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">So what would an educated person suggest? <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />...all of the benefits of living in a free society flow from a phenomenon known to economists as &quot;spontaneous order.&quot; This is a way of describing the &quot;ordered&quot; harmony of interests that arises when people are free to produce and exchange values with one another in a way regulated only by absolute prohibitions against coercion and fraud. Spontaneous order... a theory based on the observation that out of self-interested behavior emerges a variety of coordinated enterprises that simply never could have been planned. <br /><br />Educated people are capable of developing appealing theories about how everything should be, but such theories have always become messy/catastrophic in practice because of something known as &quot;the knowledge problem.&quot; Which is this: you and I have a knowledge of our specific situation, abilities, opportunities, priorities, limits (etc) that make us far more qualified than a central planner to account for uncertainty in our lives and to make use of our resources (time, energy, talent, wealth) in a way that suits us. Central planning must work against yours and my knowledge in such a way as to produce conflicts and inefficiencies that manifest as price distortions, leading to distortions in supply and demand, gross misuses of resources.... leading to inconvenience, wasted time and money, poverty, starvation, misery, death....<br /><br />Decentralized responses to specifics of time, place, individuality, cultural preferences, access to materials and distribution, production capabilities, risk-taking, trial and error experimentation make it possible for you and I to choose among varieties of different products, solutions to problems, aesthetic experiences, opportunities, and the net result of this is not just vibrant markets but also the creation of value. <br /><br />After years of conversations with a variety of environmentalists who have arrived at the &#039;certain&#039; conclusion that addressing their issues must be a function of government intervention, regulation... government subsidies of one sort or another... regardless of their costs, their impact on people&#039;s lives, liberties, on entrepreneurs, on the system upon which we rely for discovery and innovation, I&#039;ve begun to wonder how a group that claims to base its advocacy on the scientific method musters so little interest in empirical questions about the basis for and costs of its proposals.&nbsp; :-o<br /><br />Economics won&#039;t tell us what we &quot;should&quot; value, but it tells us about the costs associated with various approaches to reaching a goal. Economics is an empirical study of human behavior, particularly how people respond to incentives, how different legal structures influence wealth creation and innovation. <br /><br />Empirical examples of dynamic societies where radical government intervention in the economy results in a greater diversity of competing options, leading to refinements and incentivizing new breakthroughs, greater efficiencies, increases in overall wealth, longer, healthier lives do not exist.&nbsp; <br /><br />I do not believe that individual liberty and adapting to changes in our climate are mutually exclusive. I think they are inextricably linked, and it will be precisely the trial and error process of entrepreneurs that will continue to improve the length and quality of our lives even as our climate conditions fluctuate, as they inevitably will, regardless of what we do. <br /><br />To whichever degree a society&#039;s government is permitted to inhibit individual freedom, the impact is felt as the opportunity cost of what people might have created, innovated, invested money or effort in... as art or products or services or ideas... and now never will. The incentive structures of government regulation and subsidies have an adverse effect on us every day, in the form of resources spent by big business to lobby instead of produce, to bargain for loopholes and protections instead of innovate, to acquire success not by making products you and I would value but at our involuntary expense by virtue of political pull.<br /><br />So, my &quot;educated&quot; suggestion is to do everything you can to create market conditions favorable to your desired goals. Tonight alone I saw a Re/Max ad for finding real estate that offers eco-friendly energy alternatives, a GE ad for wind power and rendering ocean water drinkable. Start or join a group that actively promotes awareness of minimizing one&#039;s carbon foot print. Start a business building affordable eco-friendly homes. Pressure major party politicians to pass laws making it illegal for businesses to receive special advantages or loopholes or a la carte tax breaks. Pressure politicians to let us keep more of our tax dollars so that we have more wealth with which to invest in experimental new products and services. Invest in mutual funds that invest only in eco-friendly companies. Publicly shame companies and local politicians who collude to permit pollution without consequences. <br /><br />You want a better world, make a better world. Better worlds don&#039;t come from master plans, they come from dynamic, peaceful human action bounded by laws enforcing the golden rule. Let&#039;s do it!&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />***********<br /><br />I&#039;ve appreciated reading what others have written here. Plenty of food for thought. Unfortunately, I have a massive project to which I absolutely must turn all of my attention, post haste.

It&#039;s breathtakingly great. And it&#039;s reproducible all the world over. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=5523.msg62250.html#msg62250">Quote from: Frappe on March 16, 2007, 11:39:34 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Support abnormally high population growths so that the benefits of absolute economic growth of third world economy are run asunder and kept in a perpetual state of poverty?&nbsp; Over-populate the planet?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Places in the world where there are actually a greater number of people relative to available space are actually thriving. NYC vs. Niger: close to the same number of people; the main difference is that the rules in Niger are set to the advantage of those with comparative advantages in being brutal and corrupt (though this is changing!). <br /><br />Take away those bad rules, replace them with private property based rules and a system that enforces them. Then watch what happens: when populations increase in an area that has scarce resources, prices for those resources go up initially. Certainly there would be a role for some amount of charitable activity...but the higher prices have a positive effect: they attract entrepreneurs, inventors, innovators. They compete with one another to offer those resources, and many of them fail. Markets, after all, are not only places where people make profits. Most business attempts fail, but eventually some succeed, ultimately driving prices down. Success and failure is a trial and error process known to some economists as &quot;creative destruction&quot;, replacing costlier processes and products with simultaneously less costly and more productive approaches. <br /><br />This is the counterintuitive but real way in which it becomes possible for scarce resources to become increasingly available and less expensive over time. <br /><br />Unexamined intuition often rises to the level of uncontestable common sense or belief. Is the theory of evaporation more intuitive than the theory of thirsty spirits to a person who has never known about science or who has been taught to believe science is evil? Intuition has its uses, and clearly it has its limits.<br />&nbsp;<br />Consider the Hybrid Prius and gasoline. The Prius&#039;s gas mileage saves consumers at the pump and has a conservation effect on gasoline in general (less is being used). Hybrid cars are just one more step.

I&#039;ve heard directly from the sources about where the aid goes and I&#039;ve seen firsthand the consequences. What the developing world needs is to set up rules that encourage flows of capital (people, tools, and investments), goods, and services. They need markets where people can shop for goods from all over the world, just like you and I have.&nbsp; <br /><br />You and I and anybody else who wants to help people living under tyranny or oppression to escape, by donating money or time or expertise, that&#039;s up to each of us as individuals. In countries that aren&#039;t totalitarian but where roaming thugs arbitrarily destroy people&#039;s lives, what form does &quot;aid&quot; take? Donating guns? Paying to help people escape?&nbsp; Paying mercenaries to protect people and ensure that they receive food and medicine that can&#039;t (easily) be taken by the thugs?<br /><br />In less extreme situations, you and I have the option of helping groups that export know-how in the form of legal and economic scholars who can help people in other countries to set up positive systems of governance. Start or invest in a business that sells* products that can help people engaged in subsistence farming become more efficient at farming. Double a farmer&#039;s efficiency, he&#039;s more likely to let his children go to school. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=5523.msg62250.html#msg62250">Quote from: Frappe on March 16, 2007, 11:39:34 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Support abnormally high population growths so that the benefits of absolute economic growth of third world economy are run asunder and kept in a perpetual state of poverty?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Tough to figure this one out. You&#039;re saying IF there&#039;s an abnormally high population, THEN benefits of economic growth are over-consumed, which in turn perpetuates poverty.<br /><br />Well, that&#039;s wrong. Perpetual state of poverty because of too many people? Case in point,&nbsp; the population of North Korea is shrinking, the people themselves are shrinking from malnutrition. Same in Myanmar. That&#039;s the consequence of the opposite of economic growth. There&#039;s pretty grotesque environmental degradation in those countries as well. <br /><br />Economic growth is not static. It doesn&#039;t create a pie of a certain fixed size which is then consumed leaving nothing for whoever missed a piece. Resources are constantly being converted into goods and services in a market, and information about the availability of a resource is conveyed via pricing which leads to increases and decreases in demand for it, and also leads to new market opportunities. <br /><br />A brief aside here: We all realize that the high price of a scarce resource like gasoline is actually what makes it possible for alternative energy producers to compete, because now they can get the higher prices they need to get to cover their businesses&#039; costs. Artificially lowering gas prices, via subsidies from the govt. is what leads to squandering a scarce resource and keeps innovative competitors out of the competition.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, the empirical/historical record is that population growth has increased at different rates at different times for different reasons, and that simultaneously, successive generations of humans have enjoyed greater and greater per capita health, wealth, and longevity. Except, of course, in places like North Korea. <br /><br />What is &quot;abnormal&quot; population growth? The Baby Boom was abnormal, but that was a good thing, right? America isn&#039;t actually having enough babies to replace its population. Without a relatively liberal immigration policy, we wouldn&#039;t continue to thrive as we have.

It doesn&#039;t create a pie of a certain fixed size which is then consumed leaving nothing for whoever missed a piece. Resources are constantly being converted into goods and services in a market, and information about the availability of a resource is conveyed via pricing which leads to increases and decreases in demand for it, and also leads to new market opportunities. <br /><br />A brief aside here: We all realize that the high price of a scarce resource like gasoline is actually what makes it possible for alternative energy producers to compete, because now they can get the higher prices they need to get to cover their businesses&#039; costs. <strong>Artificially lowering gas prices, via subsidies from the govt. is what leads to squandering a scarce resource and keeps innovative competitors out of the competition.&nbsp; </strong> <br />Anyway, the empirical/historical record is that population growth has increased at different rates at different times for different reasons, and that simultaneously, successive generations of humans have enjoyed greater and greater per capita health, wealth, and longevity. Except, of course, in places like North Korea. <br /><br />What is &quot;abnormal&quot; population growth? The Baby Boom was abnormal, but that was a good thing, right? America isn&#039;t actually having enough babies to replace its population.<strong> Without a relatively liberal immigration policy, we wouldn&#039;t continue to thrive as we have. I wish it were more liberal.</strong><br />I am not concerned about overpopulating the Earth. I&#039;m concerned about there possibly not being enough people, over time, for human civilization to continue to thrive.<br /><br />Generally speaking, human beings are wonderful.

You&#039;re saying that such aid increases poverty by increasing the local population to an extent that &quot;the area&quot; can&#039;t handle. Granted, you note that societal factors are relevant, but you also mention geography as if we can say of a place itself that it can only support so many people, which was why I talked about NYC and reiterated my emphasis on legal obstacles to wealth generation/prosperity.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=5523.msg62310.html#msg62310">Quote from: Frappe on March 16, 2007, 04:17:46 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">So are you saying that if a million person population has access to resources that can support a half a million people, then there shall not be an expanded level of poverty?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If one put a million people into a cage with enough life-sustaining goods for half of them to live a full year at a subsistence level, more than half of them would be killed/die long before the end of the year from the hoarding and killing behavior that would ensue.

Take away the cage, people would be free to move, to trade, to save and conserve, and all of them would and should survive and thrive.

But it&#039;s also not even remotely an actual problem. Population does not grow geometrically, which was the faulty basis of overpopulation alarmists like Erlich. Moreover, empirically we see a causal link between increased wealth and slow-downs in birth rates. As the global trend towards liberalization continues, several predictable and unpredictable effects (increased life-spans, lower birth rates... impact of cloning? consciousness transferrence to &quot;bodies&quot; that can function forever?) will continue to play out, with population numbers fluctuating in ways only time will tell. No worries.<br /><br />&quot;...limitless number of people <strong>the world</strong> can support....&quot;<br /><br />From the perspective of a future human to whom &quot;the world&quot; clearly encompasses the Earth, the Moon, Mars, some moons of Jupiter and Saturn, not to mention Dyson spheres and man-made planets, your question might seem odd. Between now and then, as global markets ignite new waves of discovery and innovation, we have reasons to believe we&#039;re simply not going to come close to exhausting global resources. <br /><br />Btw, astronomers just figured out that the frozen south pole of Mars contains enough water to cover the entire surface of the planet with water 35 feet deep. This will significantly facilitate expansion to that planet for our descendants. :-)&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=5523.msg62310.html#msg62310">Quote from: Frappe on March 16, 2007, 04:17:46 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">So China is barking up the wrong tree with their population control measures?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes. Horribe govt., wrong tree.<br /><br />China&#039;s population fell victim to the rigors of totalitarian socialism for most of the 20th century. Over 73 million people died in China between 1949 and 1987 as a direct result of Chinese governmental practices, approximately 50% of them in labor camps. 73,000,000. Gut-wrenching. :cry:&nbsp; &lt;Moment of silence.&gt;<br /><br />Regarding the one-child policy, by now you realize I consider it reprehensible. I think I heard that the Chinese govt. is backing away from it right now. Also, reformers there are trying to implement legal protections for private property rights (http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/16/world/asia/16china.html). The current thug government of China wants to manage its people&#039;s inexorable embrace of freedom while still retaining as much power as possible, like the power to take its citizens&#039; wealth without any legal consequences. Talk about a country on the brink.

				The reason being that humans killed them off. They were doing just fine in their natural habitat until people discovered it and realized the birds were amusingly stupid, i.e. didn&#039;t fear people.

When people come across an undiscovered island that contains its own, self-contained ecosystem and then proceed to kill everything there willy-nilly, I don&#039;t think that&#039;s all that great. A lion isn&#039;t going to go chasing a bunch of gazelles unless it is hungry, plus gazelles are aware that lions are the enemy so they have a chance to escape. I also don&#039;t think it&#039;s any better morally if this is a people against people battle where one side is clearly helpless compared to the other, so it&#039;s not all about animals. <br /><br />Also, my view of evolution is that nature didn&#039;t take guns into account when deciding what animals can kill what. Humans seem to have been created to be resourceful but physically weak, well we&#039;ve come up with some great ways to compensate for that. At this point, our only natural enemies are viruses and bacteria, and of course each other. Fair enough, maybe that was nature&#039;s or God&#039;s intention. So basically people have a huge upper hand and can do whatever the hell they want to whatever the hell animal they want to, which isn&#039;t supposed to be how the food chain works. And what happens when you shoot a bunch of wolves (for example) is you get an overpopulation of deer, which leads to an unwanted amount of plants being consumed by the excessive deer population, which might be starving other animals of food or ruining crops, etc. We also have the intelligence to know better; unfortunately, as is with the case with global warming/pollution, we don&#039;t always exercise that intelligence.<br /><br />This is getting way off the topic and I quite possibly sound like a loon to some of you, so that&#039;ll be my last on this subject.

In fact, so many people signed our message in the 24 hours before the hearing, we are still working on printing them. But don&#039;t worry, Congress now knows that you have spoken, and I will personally make sure every last message is delivered.<br /><br />I also wanted to make sure that you had the chance to see the hearing for yourself, so I&#039;ve posted video highlights on AlGore.com:<br />http://blog.algore.com&gt;http://blog.algore.com (http://blog.algore.com&gt;http://blog.algore.com)<br /><br />After witnessing your incredible show of activism and enthusiasm, I wanted to give something back to you. As many of you know, Live Earth will take place on July 7. The 24-hour concert marks the beginning of a multi-year campaign to raise awareness about our climate crisis. It will feature more than 100 acts, including the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Snoop Dogg, Foo Fighters and Faith Hill.<br /><br />Tickets are going to sell out fast, and I wanted to make sure that you have the chance to see the show. That&#039;s why we will set aside a special block of tickets and let AlGore.com members purchase the first ones sold. I will let you know more details before these tickets go on sale.<br /><br />If you would like to learn more about the Live Earth concerts you can visit:<br />http://liveearth.org&gt;http://liveearth.org (http://liveearth.org&gt;http://liveearth.org)<br /><br />In a few short weeks we have grown into a movement of more than 500,000 strong. To ultimately win, we are going to need to grow bigger - but for now we are off to a great start.<br /><br />Thank you again for what you made possible today,<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />Al Gore<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I don&#039;t think the horse is dead....just the OT of the extinct animals. And global warming does have something to do with it, but I appreciate the discussion and the additional information. Information will spur thought, and then thoughful discussion, and individuals, myself, to think twice before a purchase, and to pay attention to what politicians are talking about in regards to &quot;green&quot; because frankly, I try to do my part, but individual decisions on whether to buy organic, or to make your own mulch using worms to grow your own food is all fine and good, but I think will have minimal, if any, effect. Change has to be made at higher levels, that will affect industry and force compliance to greener standards...this is where I am left saying..&quot;what do I do?&quot;

				What movie can I watch to stop global warming?&nbsp; Is it Animal House b/c I love that movie.&nbsp; And it has animal in the title, so its eco-friendly.&nbsp; Please don&#039;t tell me I have to do something harder than that to save our planet.

				I love some of the old threads, and this one contained some of the most intelligent discussions on both sides of the issue. <br />With that being said; I think that the recent disclosure of e-mails, if accurate, from the leading scientists on the climate change answers the original question. (Sorry for the run on sentence).<br /><br />This is a pretty good list with explanations;<br />http://bishophill.squarespace.com/blog/2009/11/20/climate-cuttings-33.html<br /><br />I hope this is a game changer for Copenhagen.
