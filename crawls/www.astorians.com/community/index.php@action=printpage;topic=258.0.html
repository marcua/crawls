				First of all, let me say that I loooove Freezepeach. &nbsp;Everything about it, from conception to execution, is original and thoughtful. &nbsp;A breath of fresh air, a ray of sunshine that is badly needed in times like these.<br /><br />On a random and tangential note... I was at Freezepeach the other night and couldn't help but notice that the barista (the cute one with the hat and stormy blue eyes) has BEAUTIFUL hands! &nbsp;I just couldn't stop staring at them as he placed my tea before me. &nbsp;Masculine, confident, and unafraid, with veins that tell a story. &nbsp; <br /><br />If I were not attached, I'd have tea there every goddamn day. &nbsp;Lord forgive me.

				Still trying to figure out what story your veins are saying. A comedy, a tragedy.....an aaaaaddddventure maybe? Maybe a Musical!<br />Hey &quot;Barista&quot;...are you musically inclined? :lol:

				&quot;I suppose that makes me the ugly &quot;other&quot; one.&quot; <br /><br />Whoa, wait a minute. &nbsp;Let me get this straight. &nbsp;There's more than <br />one barista? &nbsp;I only thought there was one. &nbsp;Had I known there was <br />another one on duty I wouldn't have made that insensitive comment.<br />When I said &quot;the cute one&quot;, I didn't mean to distinguish him from<br />the other.. because I didn't know another worked there too. <br /><br />Bottom line: my profound apologies go out to &quot;mrm&quot;. <br /><br />As far as what story courses through those veins, I've cooked up <br />some themes revolving around a soul with an eye for detail, who <br />has tremendous patience, and is not daunted in the least by sweating <br />a little to create his own personal heaven here on earth.<br /><br />Does that answer your question?

				:)<br /><br />That's a great response. I took no offense, I just saw an opportunity to have a little fun.<br /><br />By the way, regarding the tall handsome barista, I like your description of creating heaven on earth. I get that from him too - whoever he is.

				thanks goes out to all of the wonderful people who came together to make the freeze peach possible. friends, family, vollunteers...<br /><br /><br /><br />thanks femmefantastique, for your thoughtful comments. mrm and 'the barista,' must be proud to be able to serve the public of astoria in a place such as you have described. <br /><br /><br /><br />as far as the 'hands' are concerned. they have, and continue to be characterized most by the amount of 'hand-holding' they require. thanks mrm, and my wife kai, for your patience, vision, and perseverence.<br /><br /><br /><br />ff
