				I&#039;ve been with TD Bank for years.&nbsp; They&#039;re very friendly, helpful, the lines move fast and the online service is easy to use.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been very happy with them, much more so than with JP Morgan Chase.

				I&#039;m contemplating moving here as well as Chase just sent out letters to all their former Wamu customers that all the fees, minimum account balances, etc are going up a considerable amount.&nbsp; Our grandfathered free checking accounts are no more and we have to keep 1500 in there at all times.&nbsp; I see at TD it&#039;s $100 which is much more reasonable.&nbsp; Does anyone know what TD charges if you use your ATM card internationally?&nbsp; Chase is now charging $5 to do that.<br /><br />I also noticed TD charges 6% to use the coin machine unless you&#039;re a member.&nbsp; &nbsp;Another perk to become one.&nbsp;

				We love TD. We were Commerce people and stayed thru the change...not much changed to be honest. I do know that in the past when we have traveled internationally, they have issued us a separate card (at our request) attached to an account in which we set aside a certain amount of money. This way should the card be lost or stolen, it was not attached to any of our other accounts or credit cards. I don&#039;t believe that there was a fee at all. Not sure about international ATM fees though.
