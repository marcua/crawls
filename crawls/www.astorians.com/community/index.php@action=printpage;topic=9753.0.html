				Celebrations in the street throughout arab/muslim world. Also, I was walking down Steinway Street, the block just past&nbsp; Grand Central and saw&nbsp; men, in the middle of day, watching the news and &#039;Hi-Fiv&#039;n&#039; as images of&nbsp; this massacre&nbsp; were being shown in thsi cafe&#039; and they were watching. We exchanged angry looks. A bomb exploded&nbsp; outside the 42nd Street Armed Forces&nbsp; recruiting stations&nbsp; this morning. Where, oh, where are the so-called &#039;Anti-War&#039; people? The silence is deafening. :x <br /><br /><br />Gunman Kills 8 at Jerusalem Seminary<br /><br /><br /><br />JERUSALEM (AP) - A gunman entered the library of a rabbinical seminary and opened fire on a crowded nighttime study session Thursday, killing eight people and wounding nine before he was slain, police and rescue workers said. It was the first major militant attack in Jerusalem in more than four years. <br /><br />Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip praised the operation in a statement, and thousands of Palestinians took to the streets of Gaza to celebrate. <br /><br />The day&#039;s violence, which also included a deadly ambush of an army patrol near Israel&#039;s border with Gaza, was likely to complicate attempts by Egypt to arrange a truce between Israel and Palestinian militants. The U.S. is backing the Egyptian effort. <br /><br />Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev and moderate Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas condemned the shooting. But Regev said the Palestinian government must take steps against the extremists - not just denounce their attacks. <br /><br />``Tonight&#039;s massacre in Jerusalem is a defining moment,&#039;&#039; he told The Associated Press. ``It is clear that those people celebrating this bloodshed have shown themselves to be not only the enemies of Israel but of all of humanity.&#039;&#039; <br /><br />Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who only on Wednesday persuaded Abbas to return to peace talks with Israel, called the attack an ``act of terror and depravity.&#039;&#039; <br /><br />Israeli defense officials said the attacker came from east Jerusalem, the predominantly Palestinian section of the city. Jerusalem&#039;s Palestinians have Israeli ID cards that give them freedom of movement in Israel, unlike Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. <br /><br />Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said the attacker walked through the seminary&#039;s main gate and entered the library, where witnesses said some 80 people were gathered. He carried an assault rifle and pistol, and used both weapons in the attack. Rosenfeld said police were also searching for an explosives belt. <br /><br />Two hours after the shooting, police found the body of the eighth victim. Rescue workers said nine people were wounded, three seriously. <br /><br />David Simchon, head of the seminary, said the students had been preparing a celebration for the new month on the Jewish calendar, which includes the holiday of Purim. ``We were planning to have a Purim party here tonight and instead we had a massacre,&#039;&#039; he told Channel 2 TV. <br /><br />Yehuda Meshi Zahav, head of the Zaka rescue service, entered the library after the attack. ``The whole building looked like a slaughterhouse. The floor was covered in blood. The students were in class at the time of the attack,&#039;&#039; he said. ``The floors are littered with holy books covered in blood.&#039;&#039; <br /><br />

				And how many Palestinians died over the past few months?&nbsp; <br /><br />What is it with all the anit-Arab sentiment?&nbsp; Perhaps this is the sort of thing we should simply keep to ourselves and avoid making these sort of statements.&nbsp; It is what got us all in trouble last time!

				Actually, Palestinians are not all Muslim- there are a fair amount of Christian Palestinians. Does it matter? No.<br />Anyone who celebrates a massacre of people like that is a piece of trash. Whether it&#039;s Palestinians celebrating the killing of Jews, Muslims celebrating 9/11 or Americans who celebrate the deaths of Muslim civilians, murder is an awful things for any righteous or non-righteous reason. Sticking together in times of crisis is important, but making everyone else the enemy is just plain wrong.

I was saying, if we allowed&nbsp; students, licensed to carry, maybe, they could&nbsp; have stopped some of the recent massacres&nbsp; of the irrrrraattional, much better&nbsp; than prozac.

Unfortunately, Hamas, a Muslim terrorist group that has killed&nbsp; Palestinian Christians, Muslims they see as &#039;collaborators&#039; with Israel for simply working in Israel does matter. They happen to be in control.&nbsp; I have yet&nbsp; to run into Americans&nbsp; who spilled into streets&nbsp; celebrating Muslim civilian deaths. I have seen Americans, who wrongly IMO, even protest fighting the armed terror&nbsp; groups cause civillians have been killed.&nbsp; This is far worse&nbsp; than &#039;murder&#039;&nbsp; this is an organised&nbsp; campaign against the Holiest lands in the Judaic/Christian world, and close&nbsp; to Easter and Passover, it would&nbsp; be the equivalent of bombing Mecca during the Haj by Christians or Jews. You think the Muslim world would sit back and just shrug it off?&nbsp; This happens every day, missles are lobbed&nbsp; into Southern and Northern Israel. The people&nbsp; making EVERYONE&nbsp; the enemy are the ones&#039;&nbsp; who don&#039;t allow anyone&nbsp; else from other religions to live amongst&nbsp; them. Now, who is&nbsp; doing this as a matter of Govt. policy?

				Interesting points.&nbsp; I just find it so unfortunate that Hamas won any official power in the Palestinian territories.&nbsp; It seems their only function is to make peace impossible.&nbsp; All of their power is based on divisive hate politics.<br /><br />I just wish you could throw all the militant extremists from both sides into the ocean and let the majority of the people in Israel and the Palestinian territories live in peace.

There is a full spectrum of ideas. There are terrorists, there are extremists, there are those who support extremists, there are those who agree with the extremists goals but not their methods etc etc. To bring the temperature of the discussion down a notch, there are many South Americans who support Marxism. While they are not members of a terrorist group who kidnaps innocent people, they sympathize with the terrorists and provide political cover for them. The same is true for anyone who cheers about the death of innocent students, or those who cast votes to elect a political party that actually publicizes their terrorist acts.

We don&#039;t do that, and allow them to live and pray amongst us, even after&nbsp; 9/11. I could go on. <br /><br />So, you have met &#039;individuals&#039; who&nbsp; think Muslims are savages and should be bombed, and this is equivalent of actually&nbsp; bombing and&nbsp; street demonstrations of millions&nbsp; praising the killing of civilians?&nbsp; Not even a close comparison. There are entire nations&nbsp; and a&nbsp; Global Army committed to spreading Jihad/&#039;Holy War&#039; and destroying anything and anyone&nbsp; standing in their&nbsp; way, this&nbsp; hardly compares&nbsp; to five&nbsp; guys in Idaho&nbsp; on weekend &#039;manuevurs.&#039;&nbsp; &quot;Peace&quot; will come only when Islam abandons it&#039;s supremicist&nbsp; view and allows all religions&nbsp; within their&nbsp; nations and makes peace&nbsp; with the past.

				I personally feel that there is very little hope for these two groups (the Palestinians and the Israelis) to find peace. &nbsp;The Israelis have to accept the fact that they cannot starve off or kill all the Palestinians. &nbsp;The Palestinians have to accept the fact that Israel exists and is not going anywhere. &nbsp;Land settlements or not, I do not see an end in sight. &nbsp;Could it be that both groups are doomed to a life of living on the edge, upheaval and an unsettled future? &nbsp;In my book, they are both at fault and both need to make concessions.

What happens when they move out? The Muslims set up rocket launchers and bomb civilian&nbsp; towns in what&#039;s left of Israel. For them, there is&nbsp; no &#039;Holy Land&#039; for Jews or&nbsp; Christians, not unless they are under the &#039;benevolent&#039; dictatorship&nbsp; of Muslim leaders. It&#039;s amazing, the Muslim world surrounding&nbsp; Israel, is two and half times&nbsp; the USA and most of Russia&nbsp; combined and 700 Million people, yet, there can&#039;t be any &#039;peace&#039;, according to these people, until a nation of 3 million, the size of Rhode Island gives up land, including the holiest&nbsp; site of two worldwide&nbsp; religions&nbsp; Christians and Jews, representing over&nbsp; a&nbsp; Billion and a&nbsp; half human beings. Not one&nbsp; more inch, they can live&nbsp; in the Holy Lands of&nbsp; Jews and Christians as&nbsp; REAL&nbsp; equals. Otherwise, the war can continue for a&nbsp; thousand years, ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

				Sorry - I missed the part where the Israeli&#039;s are trying to starve off or kill all the Palestineans. If anything they have gone out of their way to make peace with them time after time only to be attcked in the most sub human ways by terroristic tactics. I have to agree 100 per cent with FZ&#039;s above post (And that&#039;s a first).<br />I do not buy the moral equivalency aguement when one defends themselves against attcks like these. If you defend yourself after being stabbed by a mugger,&nbsp; one should not have sympathy for the wounds of the perpetrator.<br />The Muslim countries in the middle east have said and shown by their actions time and time again that they want to destroy Israel and kill all the Jews. How does this differ from Hitler and his policies ? God forbid that the US supports the only democracy in the middle east ( the only one where Palistineans can vote freely) cause if we do, we are subjected to terroristic attacks that rise to the level of acts of war.<br /><br />

The Israeli-Palestinian issue is a lot more complex than just &quot;Party A&quot; starting it and therefore we don&#039;t need to feel sorry for &quot;Party B&quot; who is simply defending itself. This is a conflict that spans generations, and many different cultural and historical settings.<br /><br />While your analogy of the victim vs. perpetrator I think makes sense - in my opinion it&#039;s unfair to characterize the Israeli-Palestinian question so simply and matter-of-fact.

The Israelis are just as much victims as any democratic nation surrounded by hostile&nbsp; tyrants. I understand the anger of Muslims, and I don&#039;t agree with it, it is based&nbsp; on anti-democratic and religious persecution.&nbsp; The Israelis should not have &#039;given back&#039; anything, these are Holiest Lands of Christians and Jews. The lands of Israel were far larger and up to the Jordan river, at the very least. The Israelis are surounded&nbsp; enough, the more&nbsp; land they &#039;give&#039; to appease, the more they risk annhilation which is the ultimate goal, not co- existance of the Muslim side. Jerusalem is&nbsp; the land of Abraham, Isaac&nbsp; and Jesus. Muhammad&#039;s and Islam holiest&nbsp; sites in Saudi Arabia, don&#039;t allow any Non-Muslim to even set foot&nbsp; in Mecca. All religions&nbsp; are represented in Israel, the same cannot be said of the rest of that region.<br /><br />They use children and &#039;mentally challenged&#039; people as suicide bombers. I was on a Bus once, with a Palestinian Christian, and I traveled to his house&nbsp; in Gaza, then controlled&nbsp; by Israel. He had members of his family killed by Muslim Palestinians&nbsp; for &#039;working/collaborating&#039;&nbsp; with Jews in Haifa. He told me the, G-d forbid that these people&nbsp; take control, any Non-Muslims life would be in danger. This is what happens, when the Jews leave, the enemy moves in sets up rockets and lobs them in neighborhoods and bombs villages in Israel. This is perpetrated/financed&nbsp; by the surrounding Muslim nations cause they want only Muslims to be in charge of all Holy lands, mine, yours and everyones.

				I find this particular article fascinating.&nbsp; At one time, when my people were fighting the British Occupation of Cyprus, we were viewed as Terrorists.&nbsp; Yes indeed, members of my family threw stones, set fires and were messengers who carried guns at the time.&nbsp; It is fascinating how in a generation, perception has changed and we are no longer viewed as Terrorists but as bonafide members of the EU with a great quality of life and a strong economy!<br /><br />http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/10/newsid_4216000/4216931.stm

				No - we did not walk into schools and kill children but I assure you that people did celebrate when we won and the Occupiers left.&nbsp; I am sure that celebrations went on when the occupying soldiers were killed.&nbsp; Hard to swallow, but I do not think that any one on this board understands occupation.&nbsp; And, before some folks begin to respond about their ancestors, I am talking about us, our generation.&nbsp; We have our lattes, debate the pros and cons of diners etc.&nbsp; None of us really understand what it is like to have an occupying power on your doorstep.&nbsp; None of us really understand this.<br /><br />By the way, in this country, it seems that people do walk into schools and kill students, for different reasons obviously.

				Debbie, the Cyprus comment is an excellent point.<br /><br />Without making a comment on whether they were warrented or not, but the Jews of Palestine during the mandate had a few organizations themselves which were considered terrorist groups, notably Etzel and Lehi.&nbsp; They attacked civiklian targets and civilian government administrators and in a perverse &quot;politics make strange bedfellows&quot;, they considered siding with Nazi Germany to help put the sting on the British.<br /><br />Here is a link to some of the nastyness:&nbsp; Train bombing.&nbsp; 40 civilians killed.<br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo-Haifa_train_bombings_1948#_note-1<br /><br />I always found it strange how quickly this is forgotten.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Debbie my people fought British occupation as well in the 40&#039;s but there were rules to that game. The fighting was always against other soldiers not innocent bystanders.<br />I can understand people wanting freedom and have their own land but in this case the Palestinians have to blame themselves only. They choose arafat to be their leader and what did he do? steal a billion dollars that was suppose to go to build the infrastructure in the territories. When Barak handed him everything he wanted in the peace talks he choose to say no because he didn&#039;t want peace and he didn&#039;t want this killing of innocent Jews to end.

For 5768 years of recorded history, impoverished and homeless, my ancestors were methodically slaughtered simply because they were Jewish. When governments start wars, there are soldiers fighting soldiers. The innocent victims of these wars are regrettable, but territorial conflicts always take a human toll. <br /><br />Anti-Zionism is quite different from anti-Semitism.

The Jewish diaspora has been reduced to 40% of the religion. <br /><br />The Jews don&#039;t run the media.<br /><br />The Jews don&#039;t run the movie industry.<br /><br />The Jews are not all wealthy. Something I can attest to.<br /><br />Lots of people suffered as the result of wars. None as badly as the decimation of the Jewish population.<br /><br />IMHO, this thread was meant to discuss the horrible killing of Jewish children by an Arabic terrorist and the way some people consider the killing of Jews as celebratory.

Though I do not dispute your statement or choice of words about Turkish occupation or resettlement, Cyprus was not all Greek before the Turkish army invaded in the 70s. To imply otherwise appears to me to be as much propaganda as the Israelis who saw Palestine as “a land without a people for a people without a land.”<br /><br />A thought just occurred to me as I wrote this. Not to single you out, but it may be what I’ve found problematic in some comments (not necessarily yours) is that at the same time it is suggested that we should see both sides in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, especially from the Palestinian point of view, the same standard is not applied to the differing sides in the Cypriot situation.<br />

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=9753.msg117263#msg117263">Quote from: 28Grand on March 11, 2008, 07:57:48 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Neo, I agree with you completely and I mean no disrespect, but it seems to me that the “my tragedy/your tragedy” angle crept in when a discussion about Israelis and Palestinians seemingly turned into a discussion about and comparison to the conflict in Cyprus. <br /><br />I too found some of the comments made so far bothersome, though I can’t put my finger on why exactly, even after reading through the thread again. <br /><br />It comes down to, I guess, why is it that often when the Holocaust and now the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is discussed it quickly turns to “…it’s not fair, my people suffer(ed) too.” I can’t quite shake the feeling that this sentiment at least <em>borders</em> on anti-Semitism, especially in the context of this thread, because it can be construed as insensitive and belittling – just like how you feel about some of the comments that have been made about the Cypriot conflict. <br /><br />Also, and again no disrespect, correct me if I’m wrong since readily acknowledge that you know more about this than I do, but your brief summation of the Cypriot conflict is informative but leaves out a very important fact: Cyprus has had a significant Turkish population for much of it’s recorded history, no? Though I do not dispute your statement or choice of words about Turkish occupation or resettlement, Cyprus was not all Greek before the Turkish army invaded in the 70s. To imply otherwise appears to me to be as much propaganda as the Israelis who saw Palestine as “a land without a people for a people without a land.”<br /><br />A thought just occurred to me as I wrote this. Not to single you out, but it may be what I’ve found problematic in some comments (not necessarily yours) is that at the same time it is suggested that we should see both sides in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, especially from the Palestinian point of view, the same standard is not applied to the differing sides in the Cypriot situation.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well you&#039;re right that the Cyprus discussion did pop up as a &quot;comparison&quot; of sorts.&nbsp; It&#039;s probably something that should go into a separate thread, though I don&#039;t think the comparison was as much &quot;my tragedy was worse than your tragedy&quot; as much as...bad things are happening elsewhere too and no one seems to care.<br /><br />I also never implied Cyprus was all Greek before the invasion.&nbsp; Turks had lived on the island for centuries, but they considered themselves &quot;Turkish Cypriots,&quot; just as the Greek population (which was always the majority, to be fair) considered themselves &quot;Greek Cypriots.&quot;&nbsp; This is an important distinction, as while there was a movement to unite Cyprus with Greece, it was defeated, in large part due to the unwillingness of both Greek and Turkish Cypriots to do so.<br /><br />Turkish Cypriots have some cultural differences from mainland Turks.&nbsp; However, the Turkish army that occupies 1/3 of Cyprus consists of mainland Turks.&nbsp; The settlers that are being moved in are from the mainland.&nbsp; It&#039;s an attempt to artificially change the demographics of the island to use as a bargaining chip for future negotiations regarding the future of the island...more Turkish people on the island (whether native or from the mainland) means a stronger bargaining position for them, which then means a weaker bargaining position for Greek Cypriots.<br /><br />Both the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides should be heard.&nbsp; That is different, however, from denying that the island is still under occupation, that the northern part of the island is a breakaway state recognized internationally only by Turkey, and that the invasion was illegal under any measure of international law and led to the death and disappearance of thousands, which for an island as small as Cyprus (population less than 1 million!) is a giant catastrophe.<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry if this discussion is veering off course, perhaps it can continue in a different thread, but again, sine it did come up, I feel that accurate things must be said about it without bickering and arguing amongst the posters here.

				The closed-mindedness never ceases to astound me.&nbsp; Why must someone wholeheartedly agree with everything Israel does in order to avoid being branded an anti-semite?&nbsp; Why does disagreement with even one thing Israel does or even the faintest effort to say something negative about the country automatically brand you into some sort of racist bigot?&nbsp; Why doesn&#039;t anyone seem to be offended at the negative things that are said about other ethnicities, religious and nationalities?<br /><br />If we&#039;re going to have a civilized discussion, it would help to try and be fair and objective and to judge everyone on the same standards.&nbsp; Honestly, it&#039;s really upsetting to me to be &quot;branded&quot; in this way and to see others &quot;branded&quot; in this way as well, to be accused of being a racist and a bigot just because you even slightly disagree with a certain country&#039;s politics.<br /><br />I suppose that by disagreeing with some things that our government does, that makes me an anti-American as well.&nbsp; I guess I might as well move to Iran....I&#039;m sure some people on this board certainly think I (and some other posters) probably should.<br />

A person may not agree with the way a country goes about it, as one might think the US has done in Iraq and Afghanistan but when a nation’s enemies want to wipe it off the face of the map as is the case in Israel, because like it or not, that is the crux of the matter, and given the course of history, i.e., the Holocaust, care must be taken in choice of language when discussing the issue.<br /><br /><br /><br />Debbie -- You say you don’t care what people think of you but I’ve always thought highly of the majority of what you post here. You yourself said, most people reading this have no idea what it’s like to live under threat of violence so I’m a bit surprised at the tone in your comments in that I would think with your personal experiences you could extend your sympathies to people on both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.<br />

But previously you stated that you do not support the State of Israel, without a clarification on whether you meant Israel&#039;s actions or policies or its existence it’s impossible to have a clear discussion on the topic and leaves you open to questions of motive and intent.<br /><br />If you critical of me because I may or may not have presupposed something about your beliefs then who’s responsibility is it to resolve the supposition? I’m sorry but using your words, that’s where you appear to be ‘wishy-washy’. It’s unfair to be seemingly intentionally vague and then cry foul and say your words have been misinterpreted.<br /><br />For example, you state that you do not support the State of Israel, yet you do support Israel’s right to defend itself, so I suppose, which you say I shouldn’t do, that you also support the right of Israel to exist as a nation. I re-read back through your postings and you didn’t come right out and say this.<br /><br />My belief that people who do not support Israel’s right to exist are in my opinion anti-Semitic is neither incorrect, nor unfair, but I agree that it’s debatable, and as with any issue, fluid depending on the circumstances. I also realized that this is an on-going debate, in which groups such Jews Against Zionism are entitled to their opinion.<br /><br />But I have to point out that it’s quite one thing to have a debate within your own community/culture/religion about issues that affect your own community/culture/religion. <br /><br />It’s quite another story when forces and factions outside the community, who may not hold your best interests at heart, join the fray. The equation changes.<br />

				This is really a no-win situation:<br /><br />If you say you disagree with Israel&#039;s policies or even say that they share even 1% of the blame for the conflict in the Middle East, you&#039;re an anti-semite, anti-zionist, or both.<br /><br />If you then clarify that your opinions are about Israel&#039;s government and not the Jewish people, doubt is cast against you as it is assumed you are a closet anti-semite or anti-zionist anyway.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s also assumed that you agree with every other statement that has been made against Israel or Jewish people on this board (e.g. &quot;the Jews control the media&quot; even if you never made those comments yourself or commented on them in a positive light).<br /><br />In the meantime, there seems to be a fantastically strong bias, among certain posters, against Muslims, and against other ethnicities, such as Greeks and Greek Cypriots.&nbsp; This has bubbled to the surface in other threads in the past, and again in this discussion.&nbsp; Apparently though that doesn&#039;t seem to bother many people, nor do the hurtful nature of those remarks for people on this board who may be Greek (like myself) seem to concern a lot of people.<br /><br />In fact, it seems that if I say those remarks are hurtful for me, then I&#039;m branded as insensitive, because the plight of my people is not considered to be as harsh as the plight of some other race/ethnicity/religious group.<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry, but that&#039;s no way to have a discussion, unless you&#039;re on Fox News perhaps.&nbsp; I thought that we were better than that.&nbsp; I guess I was wrong.

I don&#039;t believe you would say that and imagine where you could see that as an anti semetic remark. <br /><br />In this whole thread - I did not see anything even remotely hinting at being anti-Greek or anti Cypriot. Someone brought this up as if to compare the two, and they are clearly 2 totally different sets of circumstances. <br /><br />If I am wrong, and you can Quote the exact passages where people said anything Anti Greek or anti Cypriot please do, cause I am confused as to why you should feel hurt.<br /><br />neo11 - I like you from what I read, but I think you inferring here what no one has implied. I do not want to see you feel hurt, but I&#039;ve seen no hurtful remarks. If I am wrong please show me the exact quotes. I&#039;ve re-read through this thread, and I don&#039;t see how I might have missed it.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />u say you disagree with Israel&#039;s policies or even say that they share even 1% of the blame for the conflict in the Middle East, you&#039;re an anti-semite, anti-zionist, or both.<br /><br /><br /><br />
