				I have been torn up for the last two days over what happened to those three men in the Bronx. What we are hearing about goes beyond anything I have read about in years. They went through HOURS of torture.....not gay bashing.......pure and simple torture. And the reason they were tortured was because they were gay....pure and simple. <br /><br />I can go on and on about gay rights and individual bills being forwarded through the legislatures of this country....but I will repeat what I have said before.<br /><br />There are political and religious leaders who&#039;s very words continue to make it okay to engage in these acts. They stand before their pulpits and their podiums and condemn the LGBTQ community with a hatred that corrupts our society. <br /><br />I just don&#039;t understand why ANYONE continues to support those who spout such hatred. How many more will die or be bashed or be tortured before we, as human beings, understanding this issue in a compassionate nature....and say......ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!!!!!!<br /><br />I do want to spend a moment and thank Bloomberg, Quinn and Kelly for the press conference I just watched on NY1. I watched the 3 main elements of our city&#039;s power structure stand firm against the torture that occured in our city. <br /><br />One last point....on a personal level. <br /><br />I am very glad to be here in NYC. But there are moments when I am very afraid. Not because of the city.....but because there is an element here that would hit me upside the head with a baseball bat. I will give my partner a quick kiss as he heads to the N line and I head to the R line and I can&#039;t help but wonder if I will get bashed for it. I&#039;m not doing it to prove a point. <br /><br />Tortured......<br /><br />For hours.......<br /><br />And I know that there are those that would do the same thing to me.

				The press conference, flying march today were very helpful.&nbsp; There are still two suspects to be caught.&nbsp; The Bronx Community Pride Center and Bronx LGBT leaders are meeting this week to start to prepare a comprehensive response to these attacks.&nbsp; These are truly horrifying attacks and the NYPD is to be commended for their swift action.

				We&#039;re bringing together all the LGBTQ leaders in the Bronx, the Anti-Violence Project and our supportive elected officials and city and state LGBTQ organizations - we&#039;re thinking a townhall, outreach programs to churches and schools and more flyering (still one perp free).

				It is sad that it took people a few days to come forward, but the Bronx is an interesting place, LGBTQ people tend to be very much on the DL (the down low), very discrete in their home areas and only more out when they&#039;re in other neighborhoods.&nbsp; Morris Heights, where the attacks took place, is one of the more gay neighborhoods in the borough.&nbsp;

				My agency, the Bronx Community Pride Center (bronxpride.org) works with Green Chimneys - they do good work. We&#039;re the frontline LGBTQ social service agency for the borough - they do a lot of good work especially with regard to housing for LGBTQ youth.

				All the reports I have seen suggest that the two younger victims were 17, which according to my understanding is the age of consent in NYS.&nbsp; While 13 years is too wide for me in terms of age differences in a relationship, I think that call is not for people outside a relationship to make and has to be made by the individuals, and in any case, it hardly justifies detaining all three of them for more than a day, torturing them with box cutters, burning them with cigarettes and sodomizing them with various objects, as well as beating them with bats.&nbsp; There has been no proof, aside from allegations by the people who are alleged to have perpetrated these terrible crimes that any sexual relationship existed between the 30 year old and either 17 year old - none of us, nor the NYPD, have any confirmation of if such a relationship did, or did not, exist.&nbsp; I am certain that many examples exist of 17 year old girls who have married 30 year old men.<br /><br />Knowing the Bronx and how identity is much more fluid in many of the communities in the borough, I suspect that neither of the 17 year olds identify as gay - more than likely they see it as just some sort of sexual play.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think we&#039;re going to know much about the dynamics between the three torture victims until this comes to trial.

				DADT - By Brian Cyr Art - You can reach him with your comments on Facebook <br /><br />DADT<br />by Brian Cyr Art on Thursday, September 23, 2010 at 9:09pm<br /><br />While I want DADT lifted, everyone needs to realize the buck DOES NOT stop there.&nbsp; Further laws that specifically STATE that gays CANNOT be discriminated against need to be in place and it does not take years to do.&nbsp; An Executive Order needs to be put in place and protect OUR citizens of the USA, put USA money INTO the USA and take care of our OWN for once instead of trying to take care of the rest of the world while our economic system and roads are in decline and we discriminate against our own fellow Americans!!<br /><br />&nbsp;&lt;The following has sections copied from statements of others&gt;<br /><br />UCMJ Sec. 925, Art. 125. deals with Sodomy and it states, “(a) Any person subject to this chapter who engages in unnatural carnal copulation with another person of the same or opposite sex or with an animal is guilty of sodomy. Penetration , however slight, is sufficient to complete the offense.”&nbsp; By the terms of the UCMJ, anybody who engages in any sexual activity other than man/woman penis/vagina intercourse is guilty of Sodomy. I know it sounds funny because the way the UCMJ defines carnal copulation, this would include oral sex as well.&nbsp; If the military wanted to bust someone for such activities, it could and the service member could not do a thing about it because the service member is bound under the terms of the UCMJ. Extend this to homosexuals now. Since homosexuals do not have a means by which they can engage in natural carnal copulation (penis/vagina sex), then if they want to engage in sexual activities, this would limit them to oral and anal sex only – the two sexual acts that are explicitly singled out by this article.<br /><br />That being said, lifting the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy forces openly homosexual members into a Catch-22 situation. While they are free to openly express their homosexuality – without fear of retribution, they must still conform to the Uniform Code of Military Justice and not engage in homosexual acts. Now, does the military enforce it? Generally speaking – No.… but it is written law that is enforceable, thus creating the catch-22 whereby open homosexuals would be forced to not engage in homosexual activities – still an infringement of their personal liberties. BUT without addressing this article, lifting Don’t Ask Don’t Tell still does not lift the veil of the root of the problem — Being homosexual is not the problem — engaging in homosexual activity is according to the UCMJ. If a superior knows their subordinate is a homosexual, and catches that person engaging in a homosexual act (ie, surprise inspection in a dorm room or something), then that superior is obligated through their bound duties to still hold homosexuality over that person’s head.<br /><br />So, to that end,&nbsp; to just lift the policy without making sure ALL ducks are in a row, we would need to make sure ALL barriers and restrictions are removed on the homosexual lifestyle. Since the UCMJ is a Congressional Code of law, then only Congress has the ability to repeal or amend the article – and this needs to be accomplished before it is pursued. And honestly, I am perfectly fine with Congress amending or repealing the applicable article of the UCMJ (925.125), and making sure there are no other Catch-22s so that President Obama may repeal the policy,<br /><br />&nbsp;(b)&nbsp; Policy.— A member of the armed forces shall be separated from the armed forces under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense if one or more of the following findings is made and approved in accordance with procedures set forth in such regulations:<br /><br />&nbsp; (1) That the member has engaged in, attempted to engage in, or solicited another to engage in a homosexual act or acts unless there are&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; further findings, made and approved in accordance with procedures set forth in such regulations, that the member has demonstrated that— <br /><br />(A) such conduct is a departure from the member’s usual and customary behavior; <br /><br />(B) such conduct, under all the circumstances, is unlikely to recur; <br /><br />(C) such conduct was not accomplished by use of force, coercion, or intimidation; <br /><br />(D) under the particular circumstances of the case, the member’s continued presence in the armed forces is consistent with the interests of the armed forces in proper discipline, good order, and morale; and <br /><br />(E) the member does not have a propensity or intent to engage in homosexual acts.<br /><br />&nbsp; (2) That the member has stated that he or she is a homosexual or bisexual, or words to that effect, unless there is a further finding, made and approved in accordance with procedures set forth in the regulations, that the member has demonstrated that he or she is not a person who engages in, attempts to engage in, has a propensity to engage in, or intends to engage in homosexual acts.<br /><br />&nbsp; (3) That the member has married or attempted to marry a person known to be of the same biological sex. <br /><br />&nbsp; (c) Entry Standards and Documents.<br /><br />&nbsp; —(1) The Secretary of Defense shall ensure that the standards for enlistment and appointment of members of the armed forces reflect the policies set forth in subsection (b).<br /><br />&nbsp; (2) The documents used to effectuate the enlistment or appointment of a person as a member of the armed forces shall set forth the provisions of subsection (b). <br /><br />:(1) The term “homosexual” means a person, regardless of sex, who engages in, attempts to engage in, has a propensity to engage in, or intends to engage in homosexual acts, and includes the terms “gay” and “lesbian”.(2) The term “bisexual” means a person who engages in, attempts to engage in, has a propensity to engage in, or intends to engage in homosexual and<br /><br />heterosexual acts.(3) The term “homosexual act” means—&nbsp; (A) any bodily contact, actively undertaken or passively permitted, between members of the same sex for the purpose of satisfying sexual desires; and&nbsp; (B) any bodily contact which a reasonable person would understand to demonstrate a propensity or intent to engage in an act described in subparagraph (A).﻿<br /><br />ON AND ON AND ON.<br /><br />As you can see, the way the codes and laws are written, it is not only confusing, but ultimately, even though DADT is lifted, there is NOTHING that will THEN protect a Military member while they are in service.&nbsp; The military will either try to get them out for another reason or, unfortunately, an openly gay soldier will possibly encounter discrimination and violence while on active duty and may find minimal laws protecting said individual.

				Don&#039;t ask don&#039;t tell was a compromise that should never have been made. Homosexuals in armed froces broke agreement by announcing-often very publicly--that they were homosexuals.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So we should go back to way it was before DADT.&nbsp;
