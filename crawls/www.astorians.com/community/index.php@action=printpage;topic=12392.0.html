				<strong>In Fiscal Crisis, Mayor Considers Raising Property Tax 7 Percent </strong> <br /><br />[url][http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/23/nyregion/23tax.html?_r=1&amp;em&amp;oref=slogin/url]<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, worried about the effects of the global financial crisis on New York City’s economy, said on Monday that his administration is considering imposing a 7 percent property tax increase on homeowners in January. <br /><br />The mayor said the move, which would generate an additional $600 million in revenue next year and require City Council approval, would help the city weather a worsening fiscal situation.<br /><br />New York City is heavily dependent on the financial services industry: An estimated 10 percent of its tax revenues come from Wall Street.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />When Bloomberg raised property taxes 5 years ago 18 percent, he claimed it was a temporary increase, and when the city&#039;s finances get better, they will lower them again. Well, not only haven&#039;t they lowered them, they will now increase them an additional 7%. This is for residents of condos and coop apartments, and owners of 1-3 family homes. why are there no increases again for apartment building owners and business buildings? Why must the middle class, many who are already struggling in this economy&nbsp; keep having to bear the brunt when the city&#039;s economy less than ideal?<br />

				From the Times this morning (http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/24/nyregion/24bloomberg.html?ref=nyregion):<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">So far, the city expects tax revenue to fall by <strong>6 percent </strong>during the 2009 fiscal year, which began in July. That projection was made before a worldwide financial crisis erupted, forcing Lehman Brothers, a major employer in New York City, to file for bankruptcy last week.<br /><br />The 2009 budget remains balanced, but Edward Skyler, the deputy mayor for operations, said that “after the events of recent weeks, it’s the equivalent of putting your head in the sand to hope the projections will hold.”<br /><br />“Taking no action would border on irresponsibility,” he added.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />How would you deal with this, Alex? Decrease services to the poor? If anyone can withstand higher taxes right now, it&#039;s those who made hundreds of thousands of dollars in equity in recent years due to the real estate boom (which has only modestly shrunk in NYC so far).

To turn &quot;hundreds of thousands of dollars in <em>equity</em>&quot; into actual <em>cash</em> with which to pay taxes, people have to sell their houses, or borrow. That&#039;s nice for mortgage banks.<br /><br />I think Alex is right that rental and commercial property owner, who actually earn money from the value of their real-estate holdings, also have a contribution to make. Though I doubt that the city finance office is overlooking them entirely as a source of revenue.<br /><br />--<br />It rankles me a little that Alex would rewrite the headline, &quot;Mayor Considers Raising Property Tax 7 Percent&quot; into &quot;Bloomberg looking to raise property taxes another 7 percent.&quot;<br />

				BStewart, I was stating my view in the title, I wasn&#039;t trying to rewrite the Times headline. I quoted the actual Times headline in the text below, and gave the link to the story.<br /><br />My opinion is that people who own large properties should also bear their share of tax increases. To my knowledge the last 18 1/2 percent increase did <span class="bbc_u">not</span> include business building owners or apartment building owners. I understand the need for generating revenue for the potential loss expected for 2009, I feel that 7 percent is to alot for single home owners, especially since the estimated home values estimates by NYC is over-inflated. I asked a real estate friend recently if my home could sell for that amount, and he laughed and said not to hold my breath.

Bloomberg has disapointed&nbsp; me, he has gone through every party, democrat, republican,independent, and is more&nbsp; concerned with &#039;art&#039; projects&nbsp; like&nbsp; waterfalls&nbsp; than repairing streets. Still, he has kept&nbsp; the City in&nbsp; OK shape, considering the Wall Street shenanigans.

				Good news for you rich property owners! Home prices are down 16.7% from last year (http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/01/business/economy/01econ.html?_r=1&amp;ref=business&amp;oref=slogin), so your property assessment should also be down, meaning that property tax increase shouldn&#039;t actually hurt you much at all!

It takes some time for a change in prevailing prices to change the assessment - I suppose if every building sold in the last year was given away, the assessed value of other homes would fall only by 1/3.&nbsp; There is also a cap on the amount that the assessed value of one property can rise in a year.<br /><br />&nbsp;2) As I get it, the assessment is <em>actually</em> used only to <em>distribute</em> the burden - that is, the city budget determines how much money property taxes should bring in, and sets a tax rate to make the target.&nbsp; If all classes of real-estate happen to change valuation by the same proportion, then there&#039;s no change to the end result. But if one class of property appears to be more valuable, then the owners of those properties pay more, and others less.<br /><br />&nbsp;3) Different methods are used to determine the assessed value of different kinds of property. For example, property that exists primarily to generate income is assessed based on the income, what are typically owner-occupied homes are assessed by recent sales.<br /><br />There <em>is</em> a procedure to request a change to the assessed value; I don&#039;t know what&#039;s required or what the probability of success might be.. the city has lists of what properties got revised notices by month on the Dept of Finance Property Valuation (http://www.nyc.gov/html/dof/html/property/property_val_valuation.shtml) page.<br /><br />Insomniacs might enjoy reading this Independent Budget Office report Twenty-Five Years After S7000A: How Property Tax Burdens Have Shifted in New York City (http://www.ibo.nyc.ny.us/iboreports/propertytax120506.pdf)<br /><br /><sub>After reading that message, there are no insomniacs left</sub><br />
