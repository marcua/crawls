				Astorians,<br />Sunday evening I was coming home from a paranormal investigation of the abandoned buildings at the Rockland County (New York) Psychiatric Hospital and pondered my options of how to get home without an umbrella in the torrential downpours.<br />I decided to jump off of the LIRR at 125th St. and catch the M60 across the bridge. But, somehow I managed to be distracted and ended up at GCT. ACK!!! <br />So, I jumped on a 7 train to Queensboro Plaza and transferred to an N after hiding in the middle of the platform to avoid the rain. When I got to Astoria Stop, I waited for a M60 bus at 31st and Astoria.<br />I made my stop at 44th St. &amp; Astoria Bl., Pushed open the back doors of the bus, and was ready to run the half block to my apartment.<br />As I was about to leave the bus, I heard someone yelled, &quot;Buddy, you forgot something!&quot;<br />&nbsp;I thought what could I have left behind? I have my wallet and keys and my bag of research equipment.<br />The Canadian couple handed me a cheap umbrella and said &quot;you forgot this umbrella that we found in the restaurant tonight. Good Luck!&quot;.<br />I stayed dry and made it home.<br />A New York experience that makes me smile! What&#039;s yours?<br />

				Today it&#039;s being surrounded by brick buildings that&#039;s making me smile.&nbsp; Nice, stay in place, brick buildings that didn&#039;t shake anything loose!&nbsp; But I guess that&#039;s specific to where I live, not New York in general.<br /><br /><br /><br />We forget how lucky we are in terms of going to concerts.&nbsp; We get all aggravated if after a concert we have to wait more than 5 minutes for a train, but I talk to people in other places and they have to travel hundreds of miles and get a hotel room to go to a concert. <br /><br />

				Lovely story.&nbsp; That made me smile too.<br />Though if it&#039;s only once in a while, you might want to consider living somewhere else&nbsp; :laugh:
