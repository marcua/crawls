				It has occurred to me, and to others I believe, that it might be nice to have a subforum (<em>child board?</em>) here dedicated to our astorians dining events.&nbsp; They have been very successful, to say the least, and it seems like we have at least 2 or 3 more events in the planning stages.&nbsp; And flooz&#39;s beautifully-designed fun nametags are just one more step to solidifying the &quot;official-ness&quot; (while avoiding being too uptight) of these events.&nbsp; I know I would find it helpful to have a separate area in which to discuss these group dining ideas and their subsequent logistics.&nbsp; What do you all think?&nbsp; I&#39;d also like to know what jayme and merm think about this, especially in their administrative capacities.<br /><br />And who knows, &quot;Astoria Eats&quot; could become &quot;the next big thing!&quot;

				I&#39;m not against doing this. I&#39;d suggest we put it under the &quot;activity partners&quot; section if there&#39;s no objections.<br /><br />What should I name it?

				That would be great, merm, thanks!<br /><br />However, I&#39;d still like to see it under the Food, Restaurants &amp; Festivals section, rather than &quot;activity partners&quot;.&nbsp; I can see some logic in your suggestion, but to me, it&#39;s so much about the food and restaurants in Astoria that that is the more natural connection.

				I agree with having this subforum connected to Food rather than Activity Partners.&nbsp; For me, also, I feel a stronger connection to the food element.<br /><br />Perhaps it could be called Community Dining, or something like that.<br /><br />Thanks for being open to this, merm!

				In terms of bullet points though -- it seems more like this:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Activity Partners &amp; Community Groups<br />Looking to start a community group, or looking for an activity group? Brainstorm or collaborate about activities, events, or groups here.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Then this:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Food, Restaurants &amp; Festivals<br />Astoria has some of the best food and festivities around. Post here if you have specific comments, ideas, or thoughts relating to food and fun in Astoria.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />But I can see the food relationship.&nbsp; Maybe it calls for a renaming of the Food Bullet -- Food, Restaurants, Astoria EATS, and Festivals -- if you want it here?<br /><br />

				I think the idea is that if people are looking for some kind of group to hang out with they will look under the &quot;Community Group&quot; heading, and I&#39;d like for them to see your group there.<br /><br />I realize that it&#39;s not like that&#39;s the only way they&#39;d find your group. Many people will take time and explore around the board a little more than just visiting one catagory. Still, it seems to undermine the purpose of the &quot;community groups&quot; catagory to have community group specific boards/activities discussed under other headings of the board. (Despite the fact that the purpose fo this particular community group forming is related to &quot;food&quot;)<br /><br />I suppose what I&#39;m getting at is if there was some political, spiritual, or poetry group that wanted to start their own subforum, I wouldn&#39;t feel that the best fit for them would be under the &quot;Political, Spiritual, etc&quot; catagory just because that was their purpose.<br /><br />So I&#39;d say I&#39;m still leaning towards adding the subforum under the &quot;Community Groups&quot; catagory. But if more discucsion needs to happen on this I&#39;m open to it.

				Merm, I understand your point and the fact that it is a community group.&nbsp; You are right actually.<br /><br />As one of the food group members, the issue may be this;<br />We would like to see the food group community listed at the top of the food section so that it acts as a header for the section (listing dining or bar events, reveiws of places visited, etc...) Sort of a zagat and foodie activity group all in one so of course it belongs in the food section.<br /><br />And then we can scan down into the main food section for all the day to day postings.&nbsp; it will probably be intereconnected anyway.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />

				Why not place the posts for the when/where under the community group and people can do the write ups under the food section by either type and/or location?

				Having a separate grouping, no matter where its catagorized, is cool by me... I mean, whether or not its natural to think of our eating group as more &quot;group&quot; than &quot;eating&quot;, I can just learn the discussion group&#39;s new location on the boards and go there. Consolidation is the key. Thanks merm and jayme!
