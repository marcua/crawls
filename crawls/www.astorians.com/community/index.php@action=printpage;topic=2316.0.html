				Hello all,<br /><br />I&#39;ve started a new group on Flickr for Hellgate CSA.&nbsp; Feel free to join and post pictures -- pictures of your share, pictures of the distribution, pictures from the farm trips, pictures of how you&#39;re cooking the food, pictures of the finished meals, and whatever else you think we&#39;d like to see!<br /><br />The group address is http://www.flickr.com/groups/hellgatecsa/ (http://www.flickr.com/groups/hellgatecsa/)<br /><br />Flickr is a photo-sharing/social-networking website.&nbsp; &nbsp;You can host your photos, blog them, get prints and other merchandise, and share your photos.&nbsp; (To get a free account, go to http://www.flickr.com/signup/ (http://www.flickr.com/signup/) )<br /><br />Hope to see you there!

				Ok - I joined the group, uploaded photos - but they&#39;re just in my regular Flikr section.&nbsp; They&#39;re tagged with Hellgate CSA, but how do I get them into the group?<br /><br />They&#39;re here (http://www.flickr.com/photos/49669463@N00/tags/hellgatecsa/), in any event.

				There should be a link from the Hellgate CSA flickr page that says &quot;Join this group&quot; or some such thing.&nbsp; Click on it and it will be evident what to do.&nbsp; I just joined.&nbsp; Will take pix and add them when the time is right!&nbsp; Thanks for doing this, Vidiot!<br /><br />I&#39;m going to make a mention of this flickr group in the next newsletter.

				I did it!&nbsp; But I did it by organising them as a batch in my own account, and then sending them to the group.&nbsp; I guess it doesn&#39;t really matter, though, so long as they&#39;re there.

				Laura, your pictures are wonderful!&nbsp; Loved the one of the GreenThumb truck, and also of the strawberry.&nbsp; I&#39;m really excited about this flickr group!&nbsp; We&#39;re going to have an awesome set of pictures by end of season.

				Nice pics!&nbsp; I work late and won&#39;t be able to make most of the distributions (my girlfriend handles that part), so it&#39;s nice to see what it looked like.<br /><br />You got your pics in there by way of the Organizr, but the other way to get pics into a group is by using the buttons above each picture.&nbsp; There should be one that says &quot;Send to Group&quot; -- click that, select &quot;Hellgate CSA&quot;, and it&#39;ll be added.&nbsp; <br /><br />Let me know if you have other Flickr questions....

				I&#39;m noticing that there are pictures in the group that I don&#39;t see until I log into flikr.&nbsp; For example, I can&#39;t see flooz&#39;s or wasabisam&#39;s photos if I just click on the group link (until I log in).&nbsp; Is this because they aren&#39;t added as public photos?&nbsp; I think it would be kind of neat if they were all public so everyone could see them all.

				I switched mine to public this morning after someone else told me that they trouble, so I am not sure why you&#39;re not seeing mine. Of course, I am not that familiar with Flickr, so I probably am not any help at all. Ah well...

				Hm, I don&#39;t know.&nbsp; I just double checked by logging out and clicking on the link again, and I can only see my photos and Vidiot&#39;s photos.&nbsp; &nbsp;If I click on the &quot;more photos&quot; link, I can see that you contributed a photo and that flooz contributed three, but I can&#39;t actually see the photos.&nbsp; If I click on your name, I get this message:&nbsp; &quot;There aren&#39;t any photos taken by wasabisam visible to you in the Hellgate CSA pool.&quot; <br /><br />I don&#39;t know a lot about Flikr either.&nbsp; Maybe someone else here can help us figure this out.&nbsp; :)

				I actually never log out.&nbsp; I guess some sort of cookie keeps me logged in.&nbsp; I find it works for me.&nbsp; All my pix are public, too.<br /><br />I&#39;ve found flickr to be pretty awesome!

				But I think it would be cool for people who aren&#39;t Flikr members to be able to see all the CSA photos, which isn&#39;t possible the way it&#39;s set up right now.&nbsp; I was just logging out and back in to test it.

				Hmmm.&nbsp; If your photos are set as &quot;public&quot;, they should be visible by anyone, whether they&#39;re a member of the group (or are even a member of Flickr.)&nbsp; And I just went into the group&#39;s admin page and made sure that non-members can see all the pictures, and that should be the case.<br /><br />Flickr was acting up a little a couple of days ago, and I couldn&#39;t see all the pictures myself -- they showed up when I viewed the entire pool, but not when I was navigating from picture to picture.&nbsp; But that cleared up after an hour or so, and it&#39;s back to normal on my end.

				One clarification -- I see all the photos when I&#39;m logged out of Flickr, except for flooznyc&#39;s and wasabisam&#39;s.&nbsp; I&#39;m guessing that they&#39;ve designated the photos as visible to members of the group only.&nbsp; (Beyond that, I&#39;m stumped and we may want to ask for help in the forums.)

				Nope - mine are public, so I don&#39;t get why it would act as private for people who are not logged in. I&#39;ll go in there again and see if there are any additional settings that I am missing, but as far as I know anyone <em>should</em> see my pics. Maybe I should delete and reupload...
