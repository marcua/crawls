				Does anyone know where to buy Christmas trees within walking distance of Ditmars, I&#039;m not walking to 30th Ave. and 33rd every year the family&#039;s getting bigger and the trek across Astoria blvd. is become more dangerous, there has got to be some alternative right?

				For the past couple of years, trees were being sold on Ditmars at 31st Street in front of Eckerds.&nbsp; So maybe they will be on sale again this year.

				Thanks, I remember that. I guess I just don&#039;t want to wait for them to get it together eventually....I suppose I need to make the long cold trek to 30th ave. to make other parties involved happy!

				Top Tomato should have them shortly too. Hopefully this week? I love the smell of walking past the trees every year at this time! :)

				We just bought our Christmas tree yesterday from the florist that is on Ditmars between 29th and 31st. The pricing goes from $30 to $50, and their stands are $10 (smaller) and $13 (for larger trees). We&#039;re pretty happy with what we got.

				Thanks Ditmars flower shop was a good recommendation, a bit pricey....I think we got a Douglas fir last year for $60. They wouldn&#039;t even throw in a small wreath for purchasing a 5ft tree for $50 on the other hand Christmas has arrived at my house!!! :-)

				Just walked past the Eckerd on 31st/Ditmars and they are setting up the tree stand as I type this.&nbsp; My bet is that it will be fully open for business tomorrow.
