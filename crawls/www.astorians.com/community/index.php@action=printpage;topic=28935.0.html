				Hey the Monte bar across the street from Strand Smokehouse on Broadway closed down and now I see a sign says Bonchon in Korean. I hear they specialize in fried chicken. Are they a franchise? I think they have a few in Manhattan if I&#039;m not mistaken.

				Really??&nbsp; That would be awesome if it&#039;s actually affiliated with the BonChon chain--their wings are amazing.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m surprised that Monte&#039;s closed, as I thought it was one of those Balkan &quot;social clubs&quot;.

				I heard Monte was an Albanian social club.&nbsp; Anyways yeah let&#039;s see what Bonchon brings to the table. I&#039;m hoping it&#039;s some good fried chicken! Love Southern style fried chicken though hehe. but I would give this place a chance. With Mokja opening further up It&#039;ll be the second Korean eatery in the area if I&#039;m not mistaken.&nbsp; Yeah I&#039;ll let ya&#039;ll know when it opens.

				Its good, been twice. Definitely on the more expensive side for fried chicken but is really good. Spicy though, the hot sauce is extra spicy. THeir katsu and bibimbap are good as well.

				I think the &quot;secret&quot; to Korean fried chicken is that it&#039;s fried twice, so it&#039;s extra crispy.&nbsp; After that it&#039;s just sauce/spice.&nbsp; I would think it difficult for something that is twice fried to be any healthier than something that is fried once.<br /><br /><br />With that said, if you&#039;re looking for a neighborhood comparison, Mokja on Broadway and 36th Street also serves Korean fried chicken.

				Its definitely crispy, probably not healthy, but we can pretend.<br /><br /><br />The smallest you can get is 10 pieces. its around 12$ Then if you wanted fries its extra. The meals (Katsu and bibimbap) were 13.95 and came with the meal and rice. I guess typing it it sounds reasonable, but adds up quickly, especially if your just looking for quick take out.<br /><br /><br />It is good though, don&#039;t get me wrong.
