				ACK (or Astoria Crafty/Knitty Group) is meets every Thursday at 8pm at the Freeze Peach. &nbsp;While all are welcome (crafty and non-crafty alike), and knitting is NOT a requirement.<br /><br />For those that would like to partake in the stick and string fun, think of this as your back to school shopping list.<br /><br />Knitting is, at a simple level, transferring bits of string (also known as yarn) from one stick (or needle) to another. &nbsp;It's best to start out with a simple practice project, like a scarf or pixel cat blanket or scarf. &nbsp;For this you'll need:<br /><br />1 ball (skein) of yarn<br />1 set of knitting needles<br /><br />The yarn, ideally, should be a &quot;chunky&quot; weight -- something not super thin and not super thick, relatively uniform throughout.<br /><br />It's good to start on larger (but not huge) knitting needles. &nbsp;Look for a 10. &nbsp;Bamboo, plastic, or metal will work (I like bamboo).<br /><br />If you're shopping for the goods in the neighborhood there are 2 yarn carrying stores on Ditmars. &nbsp;I'm most familiar with the one on Ditmars between 31st and 32nd (a mere 2 blocks from the Freeze Peach). &nbsp;There's a second store further down Ditmars in the direction of Steinway and I've heard they have something of a yarn selection as well. &nbsp;You should be able to buy basic yarn and needles for $10 (or so).<br /><br />Buy yarn, bring sticks, and show up on Thursday. &nbsp;I'll provide basic knitting instructions weekly to aspiring knitters. &nbsp;I've also planned to bring spare yarn bits and needles for those who haven't committed to a first project yet. &nbsp;<br /><br />Sign up for the ACK (Astoria Crafty/Knitty) mailing list at:<br />http://lists.astorians.net<br /><br />ACK isn't just knitting. &nbsp;It's sharing of craftiness. &nbsp;Bring your own or learn from the group in Astoria's own &quot;circle of craft&quot;.

				Smileys (http://www.smileysyarns.com) is located right under the JMZ train stop in Woodhaven, so easy to access by train, and if you bring a quarter you should be able to park at a meter nearby. If you're not a yarn snob, this is your nirvana. &nbsp;They also have good online and hotel sales.<br /><br />I'm also fond of Purl in SoHo. 137 Sullivan Street between Houston and Prince.<br /><br />Here are a few more...http://tinyurl.com/436c5
