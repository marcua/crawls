				I&#39;m looking to get a facial, preferably in Astoria, although Manhattan might work to (somewhere near Union Square, perhaps?).&nbsp; I do not want to go somewhere where facials are an afterthought (aka somewhere they&#39;re doing nails and hair, too).&nbsp; I&#39;d like to pay less than $100.&nbsp; Any suggestions?

				SPAce on Ditmars is great for facials. If I remember correctly a 60 minute facial was about $65.<br /><br />Beauty Palace on Broadway is great too. Ask for Kim or Lucy. They are about $50-55 per hour.<br /><br />SPAce is definitely fancier environment wise- but they are both give good facials!

				cleaning pores. they steam your face to relax your skin and widen your pores. then they extract all the dirt and stuff that has accumulated...<br /><br />it&#39;s actually very catharsic, a facial that is. the extraction can be painful but then you have a relaxing mask at the end. a good spa will also give you a nice neck massage or hand massage to relieve tension.

				I recommend Glow Spa in midtown east. Good service, good massage and products well tailored for my super sensitive combo skin. What I also liked was that they freely gave recommendations for skin products on a budget, focusing on the kinds of ingredients you want to include or avoid based on skin type. Definitely got the most bang for my buck!

As for torn up, I used to get these regularly when I had an acne problem and they helped alleviate the problem. If her skin came back all torn up, it could be that they used a harsh peeling compound in addition to the extractions themselves. Did she go to a spa that was recommended to her? The ones I used to get for my acne were recommended to me by my dermatologist.
