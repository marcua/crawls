				Dear Starliters:&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;How is everyone doing? I hope all is well. There are so many things to talk about so here we go: <br />&nbsp;<br />Only 1 week left to qualify for a chance to win $3000.00 / $1000.00 <br />Doyles Corner has been Stellar as it&#39;s been standing room only as we are in the last stretch to see who qualifies for a chance to win all the cash. I can&#39;t believe we are almost there!!! Barry The Singing Bartender told me that 2nd place is now a guaranteed $1000.00 as this contest is shaping up to go down as one of the greatest nights for karaoke. This week&nbsp; the 1st, 2nd and 3rd place winners will all go into the finals for a chance to win the cash. March 11 is the finals and unless you have a ticket you will not get in. All 25 contestants will have 2 tickets each given to them. Barry has all the tickets and you can get them by seeing or calling him at the bar (718) 278-9402. (Call After 6 PM Tues through Saturday) <br />To qualify it&#39;s this simple:<br />Just join us this Saturday, pay the bartender $10.00 (which we are giving all back by using it for second &amp; third place prizes) and be in 1st 2nd or 3rd place that night (Yes, you read that right, we are accepting the top three contestants this week) and you are in the finals for a chance to win one of the cash prizes. The contestants will draw numbers to see which place they will sing and will be judged on four categories with one to ten star&#39;s being gave for each category. The categories are as followed, 1. originality, 2. song choice, 3. your ability to sing and 4. your stage presence or showmanship.This contest is opened to Anyone and Everyone. I feel if you really think about everything we are judging you on this contest can be won by anyone with a great imagination and a deep desire to perform. Who will be next to qualify. I wish everyone the best of luck...<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;We will be filming this show and the top 5 contestants will receive a copy of their performance on a DVD.

You can borrow any of my songs but I will not be responsible for a song that skips or if I don&#39;t have it... So again I repeat you will be responsible to be prepared to sing&nbsp; 4 SONGS THAT NIGHT!&nbsp; You can borrow any of my songs but I will not be responsible for a song that skips or if I don&#39;t have a song you want so PLEASE ALL CONTESTANTS have your own tracks available with you.&nbsp; Also all finalist will be requires to sign in at 8:00 PM SHARP that night.
