				I&#39;m having an extraordinarily difficult time finding a garage in Astoria.&nbsp; I&#39;ve tried Craigslist and a couple of real estate offices, but I&#39;m having no luck.&nbsp; Does anyone know of bulletin boards or newpapers where people post garage rentals?&nbsp; Any other suggestions?

				Drive around. I see signs up pretty regularly. There were signs up on 31st St on the block North of Astoria Blvd pretty recently...

				There was a sign on 36th St. near 31st Ave. just a few weeks ago. Check grocery store bulletin boards (like the associated on 31st ave., if that&#39;s near you). I always just see them randomly tacked up.

				I also wonder if you would find something via the Village Voice? Wouldn&#39;t hurt to look...

				Thanks for all the suggestions!&nbsp; I just went walking around the neighborhood and found a nice garage within minutes.&nbsp; I guess being too dependent on the information age can be just as dangerous as being out of touch with it.

				We also had hard time finding the garage a month ago...as you said no real estate had any to offer and the ones from Craigslist were too far away. But at the end we were sooooo lucky `cause our landlord decided to rent us her garage until her new car arrives ( which will be probably in two months ). That means that we will again have to search for a garage ...I will deffinitelly take your advice and just walk around the neighbourhood instead of relying on real estate or classifieds.<br />
