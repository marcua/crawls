				I see they put up a sign for the new wine bar next to the liquor store on Ditmars.&nbsp; It&#039;s called Kilo.&nbsp; I wonder when it will open.

				Apparently, it&#039;s owned by the folks who own Adega- the liquor store next door.&nbsp; &nbsp;Good luck to them!&nbsp;

				I read a few articles that said it was going to be a wine bar. This is very strange that now it will be a Brazilian restaurant.&nbsp; This is the first I&#039;ve heard about this.

				Indeed and we were there this past Friday night and had a great time.&nbsp; It&#039;s a very comfortable space.&nbsp; Forget the wine - they have an incredible bourbon bar instead!&nbsp; Also a nice beer selection.&nbsp; And if you get hungry, you just go up to the counter in the back and they&#039;ll make up a plate to order of Brazilian BBQ.&nbsp; The staff was super friendly, as was the crowd.&nbsp; Really enjoyed our time there.

				We finally checked out this place last night - it was fantastic!&nbsp; I admit I was skeptical of the concept but the meats were so delicious, the buffet sides all tasty and it was just an overall positive vibe in there.&nbsp; A great (and unique) addition to the neighborhood, that&#039;s for sure.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=39546.msg256791.html#msg256791">Quote from: TJT on April 03, 2017, 02:12:04 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Indeed and we were there this past Friday night and had a great time.&nbsp; It&#039;s a very comfortable space.&nbsp; Forget the wine - they have an incredible bourbon bar instead!&nbsp; Also a nice beer selection.&nbsp; And if you get hungry, you just go up to the counter in the back and they&#039;ll make up a plate to order of Brazilian BBQ.&nbsp; The staff was super friendly, as was the crowd.&nbsp; Really enjoyed our time there.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I walked in there yesterday around 6:30 just to check it out and it was really crowded.&nbsp; The food smelled and looked really good.&nbsp; I&#039;m going to try it out this weekend.&nbsp; I also liked the atmosphere... very comfortable with some nice music playing

				I went here yesterday for lunch and loved everything about it.&nbsp; The food was delicious, the atmosphere was warm, welcoming and comfortable with brightly colored paintings and nice music playing.&nbsp; The service was also great.&nbsp; This will be a regular spot for me to go to.

				I was sitting at the table by the front and the windows were open. I felt like I was sitting outside and just by sitting there with my plate of food I was attracting people to walk in.&nbsp; That&#039;s the way it was for me.&nbsp; I was walking by and saw people sitting there and I wanted to go inside and check it out.&nbsp; This is so different from any restaurant in the area.&nbsp; The food is so unique and delicious.&nbsp; I just have to be careful not to eat too much&nbsp; :rolleyes:
