				Very interesting, Sweeper. I&#039;m afraid that I&#039;m only familiar with &quot;social engineering&quot; as it describes someone who tries to gain access to confidential information by pretending to be someone else.

				<strong>Are we having a financial crisis? </strong><br /><br />I don&#039;t know about the &quot;we&quot; part, but <strong>I</strong> certainly am having a financial crisis. As I am retired and can no longer contribute to my 401K or, for that matter, to any retirement savings. My capital had decreased by almost 27% in the last few weeks. I don&#039;t have the 20+ years to &quot;make it up.&quot; My money isn&#039;t going to live through the adjustment period. But, the worst part is that if I decide to pull my money out of investments, I will still have to worry about the solvency of the banks I transfer it to. As a retiree, I need to augment my Social Security monthly from my savings. If this keeps up, I will need to be dead before I turn 80 because my money will have dried out! Then I will will lose my home, my car and my independence, and probably be thrown into a warehousing situation in some G-d awful nursing home that probably won&#039;t have internet access. <br /><br />How could this be happening in the greatest country on earth?

It just didn&#039;t sound right to me.&nbsp; And yeah, it hasn&#039;t turned out so well, has it?<br /><br />I kinda view this as more of a symptom of our credit based economy, though.&nbsp; People don&#039;t live within their means. And that&#039;s a huge problem. Yes, the world needs credit to do business, but it needs to be done in a far more responsible manner.&nbsp; And individuals don&#039;t have the luxury of getting balled out by the gov&#039;t.

				Also, if you own a home, it&#039;s a lot harder to move when economic opportunity arises elsewhere. That&#039;s true always, but particularly true during a time with falling home prices (like now). There are a lot of people with negative equity on their home who literally can&#039;t sell their home and move. It&#039;s likely to make the downturn even worse than it would otherwise be. Homeownership is over-rated.

Yellen, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, independent mortgage companies made &quot;high-priced loans&quot; at more than twice the rate of the banks and thrifts; most CRA loans were responsibly made, and were not the higher-priced loans that have contributed to the current crisis. http://www.frbsf.org/news/speeches/2008/0331.html (http://www.frbsf.org/news/speeches/2008/0331.html)</li></ul><br />If one is inclined to look at what government actions and inactions have led us down this path, Barry Ritholtz had an excellent article in Barron&#039;s about how Washington contributed to the crisis including a 2000 law which ensured that credit default swaps would remain unregulated, the SEC’s puzzling 2004 decision to allow the largest brokerage firms to borrow upwards of 30 times their capital and that same agency’s failure to oversee those brokerage firms in subsequent years as many gorged on subprime debt. http://online.barrons.com/article/SB122246742997580395.html (http://online.barrons.com/article/SB122246742997580395.html)<br /><br /><br />

Yellen, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, independent mortgage companies made &quot;high-priced loans&quot; at more than twice the rate of the banks and thrifts; most CRA loans were responsibly made, and were not the higher-priced loans that have contributed to the current crisis. http://www.frbsf.org/news/speeches/2008/0331.html (http://www.frbsf.org/news/speeches/2008/0331.html)</li></ul><br />If one is inclined to look at what government actions and inactions have led us down this path, Barry Ritholtz had an excellent article in Barron&#039;s about how Washington contributed to the crisis including a 2000 law which ensured that credit default swaps would remain unregulated, the SEC’s puzzling 2004 decision to allow the largest brokerage firms to borrow upwards of 30 times their capital and that same agency’s failure to oversee those brokerage firms in subsequent years as many gorged on subprime debt. http://online.barrons.com/article/SB122246742997580395.html (http://online.barrons.com/article/SB122246742997580395.html)<br /><br /><br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I wonder&nbsp; how much these lawyers&nbsp; made from the subprime&nbsp; loans, that are making these excuses. Fannie Mae and Freddie were the main, Federal gateways, regardless&nbsp; of&nbsp; who made the actual end loans. Even Clinton admitted&nbsp; those who were&nbsp; against&nbsp; the 1999, he signed, were correct.
