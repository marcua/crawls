				** Amendment I<br />Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances. <br />**<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>Dear Friend, <br />Senator Russ Feingold is introducing a bill to redeploy our troops out of Iraq, and he needs our support. Please visit the link below to sign the petition. Thank you! </strong> <br /><br />http://ga1.org/campaign/iraq0107?rk=DpsJNKs1XmrLW <br /><br /><br />http://www.progressivepatriotsfund.com/<br /><br />***<br />&quot;According to the latest news reports, in the coming days the President will address the nation about his intentions regarding the situation in Iraq. While the President ought to set forth a timetable to redeploy our troops out of Iraq as soon as possible, all signs point to a repackaged version of &quot;stay the course,&quot; possibly with an increased U.S. presence on the ground. That strategy simply doesn’t make sense. Our open-ended presence there only fuels the insurgency, and adding more troops with no end date in sight only adds more fuel to the fire.<br /><br />Thanks to each and every one of you, starting today, Democrats now control Congress – and now is the time for us to lead. There is no higher foreign policy priority than making America safer and getting our nation back on track by redeploying our troops out of Iraq. <br /><br /><strong>Co-Sponsor the Resolution to Redeploy Our Troops Out of Iraq</strong><br /><br />It has been almost two months since Americans went to the polls and rejected the President’s strategy in Iraq. Since then I&#39;ve continued the fight we started in August 2005 when we were alone in demanding a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq. Today, in this new Democratic Congress, I have introduced legislation that would require the redeployment of U.S. troops from Iraq within six months. <br /><br />Co-Sponsor the Resolution to Redeploy Our Troops Out of Iraq<br /><br />The administration has repeatedly ignored recommendations for a timely redeployment of our forces currently fighting in Iraq. But it&#39;s reckless to continue to devote so much of our resources to one nation while ignoring the growing threats we face elsewhere in the world. It is now time for Congress to work toward redeployment. <br /><br />I&#39;m asking for citizen co-sponsors from all 50 states to join my call for redeployment. I know the Progressive Patriots Community has always been by my side and I hope you’ll continue to work with me on this extremely important issue. <br /><br />Co-Sponsor the Resolution to Redeploy Our Troops Out of Iraq<br /><br />I will continue to work for a sensible foreign policy that refocuses our efforts from Iraq in order to continue the global fight against terrorist networks. Please co-sponsor my resolution to help send the message that we can&#39;t afford to wait any longer. It&#39;s time for Congress to take the necessary steps to fix our Iraq policy immediately. <br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Russ Feingold<br />U.S. Senator<br />Honorary Chair, Progressive Patriots Fund&quot;<br />

				Not related, but there is a great interview transcript with DeNiro, Damon, and former CIA at<br /><br />http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16269379/<br /><br />It contains movie spoilers. Though a lot of great talent is involved, I would suggest catching Good Shepherd on DVD if at all. But Damon&#39;s performance was a standout for me.
