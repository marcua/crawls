				It seems that the Great Depression we are in now has also caused hospitals to start closing down...St. John&#039;s Queens Hospital in Elmhurst and Mary Immaculate Hospital in Jamaica:<br /><br />http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2009/03/01/2009-03-01_councilman_eric_gioia_rips_hospital_clos.html

				The decision process in closing them was made before economic turndown.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is shame they are closing, and wrong, but it&#039;s not cause of U.S. economey, it&#039;s ongoing New York economey problems.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Also mismanagement of hospitals, and bad mayor after bad mayor.<br /><br />Meanwhile they just spent millions to rename Triborough bridge.&nbsp; &nbsp;Where are their priorities?

				Both hospitals had originally filed for bankruptcy well before the current downturn -- in July 2006, in fact.&nbsp; So while the fact they weren&#039;t rescued this time, as they were then, is likely due to the current economic situation, the fact that they were in trouble is not.

I&#039;m really not happy with the prospect of having to choose one in the future should the need arise.
