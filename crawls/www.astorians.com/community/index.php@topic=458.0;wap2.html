			on 30th Ave there are two good Thai restaurants. &nbsp;Thai Pavilion, near 30th and Steinway, is more of a sit-down place where you can have wine with your meal. &nbsp;Yum Thai is near 32nd and 30th and is great cheap fast-food Thai. &nbsp;I recommend both.<br /><br />Thai Angel is across the street from Yum Thai but I have not been impressed with them.
