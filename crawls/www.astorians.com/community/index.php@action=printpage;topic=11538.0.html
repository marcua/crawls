				Hello my fellow Astorians. We have been here now for 4 months and we love it. We just took an evening stroll through the park and love the community feel of this neighborhood. We have an 11 year old son and he&#039;ll be attending I.S. 141 come September. He loved the park where his dad and himself played catch while I sat with the two dogs just taking it all in. It&#039;s an amazing view at the foot of Hell&#039;s Gate bridge. There seems to be plenty of activities going on in the neighborhood for adults but I&#039;m hoping to meet other parents with children of this age range. Let me know if there are any fun things going on that our children can interact and meet each other. We&#039;ll be going to the batting cages this weekend, so hopefully he can meet other boys his age there. <br /><br />Hope to hear from anyone.

				Hello and welcome!<br /><br />There are local sports leagues like ICYP and Elmjack for baseball (sure you can google them) which is always a good way to make friends. Don&#039;t know what the team schedules are - if season is in the middle, end, etc. There is a soccer league thing that takes place in 141. Astoria pool is nice also (not 1st class but livable). But don&#039;t worry, I&#039;m sure once school begins he will meet a ton of kids. Where are you guys originally from?<br /><br />BL30

				Thanks for the suggestions. I&#039;ll definitely google all the information. We have gone to the pool. Yes, not 1st class but we still truly enjoyed. People there have been well behaved and it is very clean and not to mention that it&#039;s just across the street from us. Lots of kids, but although our son is very social, it seems to be very overwhelming to him. He is looking forward to the new school and he has read up on it and he likes what he&#039;s seen. I hope the school actually lives up to all that we&#039;ve found. <br /><br />We moved here from the city. We were living in the Financial District for three years and we decided to move somewhere we could see ourselves for a long time. <br /><br />Do you have a child in 141?

				He is in his last year at 122 (the elementary school for your area at ditmars and 21st). After that he may go to 141, not sure yet. <br /><br />Do you live on a block with a lot of kids? Unfortunately, there are not to many areas any more where kids play together outside like when I was a kid. No one feels that is safe to do anymore...<br /><br />If your son is more on the shy side, meeting kids in his class once he starts school will probably be the easiest on him.<br /><br />If you have any questions on the neighborhood, please ask, I&#039;ve live here my entire life. <br /><br /><br />
