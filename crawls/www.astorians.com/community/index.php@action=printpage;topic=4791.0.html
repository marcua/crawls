				Hi, all,<br />Been lurking for awhile but this post prompted me to register.<br /><br />My boyfriend lives near Aces and we&#39;ve been three times; each time it was terrific. Here&#39;s a copy of a post I wrote on another board after our first visit:<br /><br />Stumbled across a brand-new Astoria restaurant called Aces tonight. Loved it. Miguel, the owner, has been working in the restaurant industry for a number of years, and his experience shows. He and his staff are friendly, enthusiastic and competent, the menu reasonably priced and inventive. The place is unassuming from the outside (and, truth be told, I&#39;m not a big fan of the name), comfortable if unremarkable inside: Low light, a bar area at the front and comfortably spaced seating for about 28 at the back. But oh, the food: I had the sautéed Atlantic salmon, braised fennel, caramelized grapefruit, steamed arugula and grapefruit &quot;gastrique&quot; (OK, i had to look that up: it&#39;s a grapefruit reduction). My boyfriend had the slow-cooked short ribs in mole, roasted root vegetables and sautéed spinach. It was all delicious and the portions are just right. We split a sweet and airy tres leches for dessert, and Miguel threw in a glass of Riesling for each of us to go with (can&#39;t, of course, guarantee that this will be everyone&#39;s experience, but it was ours). The bill, including a glass of wine for me and a scotch and soda for my bf, came to $55. Anyone mourning the neighborhood&#39;s loss of Li&#39;l Bistro 33 -- or, really, anyone looking for a great meal -- should go.<br /><br />* * *<br />The third time we went we sat at the bar and had snacks and drinks; the cornmeal-crusted calamari is crispy, not remotely rubbery, and really just done to a turn.<br /><br />Sorry for the long first post, but I can&#39;t say enough good things about this place! Looking forward to hearing everyone else&#39;s impressions....

				Has anyone been here more recently? The only person to review it on citysearch gave it a really horrible review last week, but the couple of reviews here seem to be positive. The boyfriend and I were thinking of checking it out for Valentine&#39;s Day, so any input would be appreciated. And does anyone know if they have a website?<br /><br />Thanks&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				all the food i tried (2 weeks ago?) was pretty tastey. i had the skate which i LOVED, but it looked like the only dish that was really a decent portion. Most of the other plates just looked a bit on the smallish side. I think most of the entrees were $15-20. I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to go there but it was nice.<br /><br />this is the mole beef rib thingie<br />(http://farm1.static.flickr.com/178/375599120_bc9c11ceb4.jpg)<br />there are some more pics on my flickr of the other meals, sadly i ate mine so fast- i forgot to snap it!

				I didn&#39;t think the shortrib dish was too small at all.&nbsp; I also had a salad that I shared, and it was quite large -- plenty for two people.<br /><br />I enjoyed my meal there.&nbsp; It wasn&#39;t perfect -- the shortrib could have been cooked longer (not tough, but not melting), and the sauce wasn&#39;t very mole, but it was tasty, and I&#39;m curious to go back and try a few different things.

				Just tried Aces, and I was very impressed!&nbsp; I had the striped bass with mango and black bean sauce and spinach, it was very good!&nbsp; The portions were just right, and I actually enjoyed leaving not feeling stuffed.&nbsp; It was Sunday so it wasn&#039;t so busy, but they had a pretty good amount of people there.&nbsp; The waiter - maybe it was Miguel? - was friendly and brought out some great chardonnay.&nbsp; This place reminds me of 718 on Ditmars, and would make a good romantic date spot.

				Just had dinner her tonight.&nbsp; It was great.<br /><br />We had the Huitlacoche Risotto, the striped bass with pureed black beans and mango coulis, and the lamb shank.<br /><br />We were really happy with all of it.<br /><br />They just have to change the music - what&#039;s with the bad house music?

				I saw this tread on monday, and had to check the place out (especially since I live just a few blocks away on 36th ave), so we went last night.&nbsp; I was a little surprised when the bill game ($70 w/ tip), and more surprised when we found out it was cash only.&nbsp; Otherwise, very pleased.&nbsp; I had the salmon and my fiance had the burger (the burger was better than the salmon though), and we had the Tres Leches for dessert, which was amazing.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very romantic spot, and a place that needs to be incouraged.&nbsp; Definatly a&nbsp; thumbs up.

				My boyfriend and I just went there for dinner a few weeks ago...had an interesting experience. We both really liked the ambiance and the service was wonderful. It was one of those places you can kinda sink into. We were a little surprised about how small the menu was though! A small menu is just fine, but it was just smaller than we had expected. Not only that- but we seemed to be surrounded by people who had gotten apps/entrees that we couldn&#039;t find on the menu! I think we saw some delicious looking fried calamari (or something fried) at the table next to us, but it was nowhere to be found on the menu...I got the chicken with the spinach and carrots and my boyfriend got the lamb over couscous. The chicken was delicious but a very small portion....the lamb was too gamy. I don&#039;t know, I&#039;ll def. try again, but wasn&#039;t as good as I had expected. However, I think it would be a nice place to hang out for a drink or two....

				I went to aces couple of week ago and i have to disagree with food and service. I don&#039;t know if it was a bad night for the staff but me and my b/f did not have a good time. We waited over 30mins for our appetizers. We also waited another hr for our entrees. It was ok nothing WOW on the entrees. Horrible night! So we decided to go back b/c we wanted to try something else. And let me tell you something, either there are 2 different cooks there or they just don&#039;t know what there doing b/c the food did not come out consistant. We had the scallops again and it was nothing like before. I think they need the chef in there to be better. Only thing good was the Tres Leche Cake. Cocktail were good too.&nbsp;

				The service needs to be improved... thats for sure. But on a weekday night the place was filling up by the time we were done with our dinner. I thought all the dishes were very good, and the cocktails they whip up were unique and delicious. Very friendly staff, and a nice place to spend a night locally.

				I went last night, and was surprised that it was fairly empty at ~7:30 (though it had filled up a little by the time I&#039;d left).&nbsp; The passion fruit caiparinha was excellent, and I enjoyed the panko-crusted skate with the balsamic onions (it could have been a bit crisper though).&nbsp; For some odd reason, they had run out of all of the desserts except for the Tres Leches cake, which didn&#039;t interest me.&nbsp; Would I go back?&nbsp; Maybe--many of the other dishes sounded interesting.

				Went to Aces about two weeks ago and the food was fantastic, as were the drinks.&nbsp; The actual operation of the restaurant was baffling though.&nbsp; It seemed as if a great chef and an imaginative bartender opened a restaurant without realizing people would actually show up and they&#039;d need a front-of-house staff.&nbsp; That being said, it&#039;s a definite place to head in the neighborhood for a well-prepared, creative, and relatively inexpensive meal.

				have been to Aces twice. the food is fantastic. everything we had was very interesting. the prices are reasonable, the service is very informal, but friendly. I think a problem is you can&#039;t see into the place. They have curtains up front that prevents you from seeing into the restaurant. This probably scares off some people.

				Walked by Aces the other night and the sign in its window read &quot;Aces Mexican Restaurant&quot; and advertised a $6.95 lunch special. Is the era of the cigar leaf mojito done? If so, that&#039;s a shame -- I just moved to this part of the neighborhood and I was looking forward to having Aces&#039; bar become my local of sorts...

				I&nbsp; have been wanting to go to this place for a year and finally had the chance on Friday.<br />We started off with a Cipriani. Me a mango and my husband plain. Nice drinks.<br />The place was empty so the service was great.<br />For appetizers we had:<br />Chicken wing bbq style- Great wings<br />Guacamole- Good<br /><br />Slow cooked short ribs with mole sauce - I love ribs and these were great.<br />Pan sheared chicken breast- My husband thought this was excellent. The polenta was yummy. I kept picking at it.<br />They found out it was my birthday and sent over a slice of Chocolate bread pudding- Good<br /><br />They mentioned they are starting brunch. We are definitively going to try that.
