				FROM TRANSPORTATION ALTERNATIVES:<br />______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />Speak Out Against Deadly Streets<br /><br />Demand That Mayor Bloomberg Take Action Before Another New Yorker Dies<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Emergency Rally for Pedestrian Safety<br />Sunday, March 4th <br />3 pm <br />City Hall Steps<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Someone is killed by a vehicle almost every other day in New York City. Already this year, too many have lost their lives. Help sound the alarm before another life is lost. The City must set targets to reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities 40% by 2009. <br /><br />The Problem:<br />In 2006, over 10,000 pedestrians were hit by cars and trucks in New York City. One hundred sixty-six were killed. The City&#039;s pedestrian safety efforts are inadequate. Where is Mayor Bloomberg? He has spoken out about transfats, gun violence and smoking. If killing a pedestrian with a car was considered assault it would be the second leading type of homicide behind only gun violence. Where is his leadership on this issue? <br /><br />The Solution:<br />It is well-established that pedestrians are being hit in the same locations again and again. Just 10% of the City&#039;s intersections account for over 50% of all fatalities and injuries. In some locations, such as Downtown Brooklyn, both the design plans and funding have been secured for pedestrian safety improvements, yet the Department of Transportation has failed to implement them. Two weeks ago, four-year old James Rice was killed by a Hummer at 3rd Avenue and Baltic Street in Brooklyn--an intersection that has been slated for safety improvements since 2004. The City knows where the most dangerous streets are, it knows how to fix them and it must fix them without delay. Two nightclub deaths have prompted City Hall to take immediate action to strengthen nightlife safety. Pedestrian safety must be a higher priority than it currently is. <br /><br />Stand with families of crash victims and hundreds of others to voice our outrage and call on the Mayor to prevent future tragedies. You can also help us by passing this announcement on to friends, neighbors and community listservs. <br /><br />This event will happen rain or shine. Children are welcome. <br />If you bike, bring a lock. Bikes are not allowed inside the City Hall gates.<br /><br />Contact Brooke DuBose at 646-873-6020 or email ped@transalt.org for more information.<br /><br />
