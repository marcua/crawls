				Congratulations!<br /><br />First thing you might want to think about is what type of birth you want to have.&nbsp; More intervention-free&nbsp; - i.e. birthing center, or more &quot;standard&quot; hospital birth.&nbsp; Then, once you&#039;ve decided - find a hospital/birthing center and finally figure out what OBs / Midwives practice there.<br /><br />

				I think most people in Astoria go to hospitals in Manhattan to give birth.&nbsp; St Luke&#039;s Roosevelt for instance has a traditional maternity ward and a &quot;birthing center&quot; if you want to use a midwife.&nbsp; Mt. Sinai in Astoria is not any place you want to go.

				You don&#039;t go to the hospital on 30th ave unless there is absolutely no other choice...<br /><br />St. Lukes Roosevelt, NYU Medical Center, NY Presbyterian and Lenox Hill are the big places to give birth in Manhattan.

				Agreeing with Jennifer - having an OB close to your office is more important than close to your home, given how often you&#039;ll have to go.

				I had both my kids at NY Presby on 68th St. and York Ave. Had complications with both, one had to stay in the NICU, and I am so glad I went to that hospital as opposed to any other. They took care of me and the babies very well. I have a car so I ended up getting a monthly parking pass and going there day and night to be with my baby in the NICU. It was a quick drive even with traffic and bad weather.<br /><br />The only time it got a bit hairy was during the holidays with holiday traffic and lack of parking, but since I was having complications, the subway (stairs) was a no-no for me. <br /><br />I was suprised to hear about the high C-section rates that another poster stated. I had major complications and they were able to avoid a C section. I think that has a lot to do with the doctor as well. Once you find a good hospital, you need to find a doctor that is on the same page with you. Although they are a very busy practice and you might get any one of the 4 OBs to deliver you depending on who is on call, I can recommend Cornell Medical Associates. <br /><br />If you want to avoid the city, I understand that there is also a wonderful labor and delivery unit at Long Island Jewish which is not that far away.<br /><br /><br />Congratulations and&nbsp; Good Luck!
