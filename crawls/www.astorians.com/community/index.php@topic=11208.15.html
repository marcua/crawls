For that to work the buyer should make about $150,000 a year. Can you imagine anyone with that income living in these shacks?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes it’s ridiculous that those shacks are on the market for 640K but you fail to note that amount reflects the value for the land, not the houses themselves. I’m sure those lots are zoned for a minimum of at least one 3-family house meaning that with the cost of purchase and rebuilding a developer can still make a tidy profit.<br /><br /><br />When the stock market crashed in 1986, the real estate market quickly followed mostly due to massive layoffs in the financial sector. Existing residents didn’t have the money to buy and with a shrinking job market, people were deterred from moving to the New York. No jobs, or no new jobs simply meant less demand for housing.<br /><br />Prices fell about 30% on average from their peak with the market bottoming out sometime in late 1991 to early 1992. <br /><br />Real estate prices will fall when people start losing jobs. Regardless of how bad the economy is currently perceived to be, people still have money and will continue to buy. Layoffs seem to be starting now but it’s too soon to tell. I pray for everyone because this credit crisis has the potential to get real ugly. <br /><br />How ugly remains to be seem. Unlike 1986, the market is affected by overseas investors from Europe, Russia and South America. So even if domestic demand drops there’s increased demand from overseas buyers because of the low value of the dollar American properties are seen as attractive. (A million dollar apartment in Manhattan seems a bargain compared to the price of a flat in central London.)<br /><br />In the end, does it really matter for the average Astorian? A 10-20-30, even a 40% drop doesn&#039;t faze me -- I know I still wouldn’t be able to afford to buy a house !<br /></div>

And while there will be some foreign buyers, a local housing market that relies on outside buyers and excludes it&#039;s local populous, always fails. Look at Florida and Las Vegas. They were sure they would remain robust due to &quot;snow birds&quot; and retirees. Didn&#039;t really work out for them.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_138293">If the asking price is 640K I’m sure the selling price will be less and a professional builder, who has the resources available including non-unionized labour, can replace those shacks at minimal cost -- and given the lackluster designs and shoddy construction of other buildings going in the neighborhood it will the most minimal allowed by law. <br /><br />If two, 3-family houses are allowed on those lots then yes, a tidy profit will be had at best, or at worst, a builder will break-even and rent out the apartments in whatever is eventually built to cover costs until the market picks up.<br /><br />I’m not sure what you’re trying to get at but we really aren’t in disagreement on whether housing prices in New York City will fall but it won&#039;t happen until the jobs market crashes. If or when that occurs we’ll see by what percentage prices actually fall because it will be mitigated by demand from overseas buyers. If that demand collapses then yes, it will make a crash in New York more serious.<br /><br />Recently, I learned an interesting fact, which is probably common knowledge, but I never made the connection and that is during the Great Depression a certain group of people never had it so good -- commodities were plentiful and prices were low. That certain group of people are those who had jobs and a steady income. Only those who didn’t have work were devastated.<br /></div>

I think, taking that into consideration, property values won&#039;t fall that much in the next 10 years. There is such limited real estate in NY that even Astoria will retain much of its value.I agree it&#039;s overpriced now, but prices haven&#039;t really plunged anywhere in NY, I think. </div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_138355">I see a few problems with the housing chart by Dr. Shiller, and while I’m no economist (or real estate developer), these seem to be vary basic flaws in the though process that we would return to the 100% bench mark in NYC on the chart.<br /><br />1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population, world population has grown, and NYC has at least kept up.&nbsp; Last time I tried to look up what it was in NYC, it was around 8 million and projected to be 9 million by 2030.&nbsp; Larger population, means that the demand isn’t going to drop back down to this “mean”<br />2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Globalization, NYC’s market supposedly is being propped up partially by foreign investors (who are prob. also buying up Astoria but I really have no data) largely due to the value of the dollar (as someone earlier noted, $1.0 million might seem like a bargain for someone looking to buy in London).<br />3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Single Family Home, according to Wikipedia (ok not the best source I know) Dr. Shiller’s data is based on single family homes, which there are relatively few in Astoria.<br /><br />I think the chart is interesting, but it is also important to note that we haven’t dropped back to the 100% line since the mid 1940’s, and the housing market is drastically different now than it was back then.&nbsp; Home Buying is open to more people, which will drive up the price higher than the inflation-adjusted value of the 1890’s.<br /><br />I think there is a larger correction in the market place coming, and home values will drop over the next year, but ultimately, due to Astoria’s proximity to Manhattan, I think the drop will not be as bad as it is (and has been) in the rest of the country (worst case scenario Detroit).<br /></div>

I do think proximity to Manhattan can not be underestimated, even with a major financial downturn. This isn&#039;t Vegas or Arizona or Texas, where there is just sprawling land and no attention paid when building to commute times. Anyway, I guess we&#039;ll all see. <br /><br />I also don&#039;t really think that you can totally rely on big economists for complete guidance. (whatever happened to Drucker... he was huge in the 80s and now is rarely invoked..)</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_138477">I don&#039;t know if this is really the place to have a big debate on this issue.&nbsp; But I&#039;d like to recommend a blog if people are interested in this kind of thing.&nbsp; It relates mostly to Manhattan real estate but there is a terrific exchange of information and it&#039;s not one of the more vulgar blogs that trash talk renters vs. buyers.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.urbandigs.com/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.urbandigs.com/</a>&nbsp; And this site will show you recent sales in Queens listed by town.&nbsp; It shows quite a bit of sales activity in Astoria.&nbsp; Prices included. <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dof/html/pdf/08pdf/rolling_sales/july2007_june2008_rollingsales_queens.pdf" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nyc.gov/html/dof/html/pdf/08pdf/rolling_sales/july2007_june2008_rollingsales_queens.pdf</a><br /><br />I&#039;d also just add that while I too know many people who can&#039;t afford a home in NYC right now, I also know many who did purchase in the last 10 years.&nbsp; And many of those folks sacrificed many many months of restaurant meals and entertainment before, during, and right after the purchase.&nbsp; Others went back to school to raise their earning potential.&nbsp; Others asked for overtime or even took on a second job in order to meet the costs of purchasing a home.&nbsp; Others delay having children.&nbsp; I&#039;m not knocking anyone here.&nbsp; But it&#039;s not only developers who can afford to buy homes.&nbsp; It&#039;s also regular people who struggle to make it happen for themselves.&nbsp; So sometimes it&#039;s best to look within and find out how we can rise to the occasion.&nbsp; Before we spend time and energy wondering if the national economy will tank so badly that prices drop to meet a present situation.<br /><br /></div>

That was what convinced me that I wanted to buy a place, and it made sense for me at the time. In the end, if you can buy a home and pay pretty much what you are paying in rent, or even a little bit more, it makes sense, and in the end you will win out. But if you are looking at doubling or tripling your monthly housing expenditure, which is what it would take for a lot of us right now, most of the motivation goes right out the window...</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_138515">NYCGoalie makes some very good points. &nbsp;I&#039;m not going get into dollars per se but obviously it takes certain means to buy any home in any decent area in any of the 5 boroughs. &nbsp;Certainly I don&#039;t condone anyone becoming house poor. &nbsp;After all, that&#039;s exactly what brought on this mess. &nbsp;Be it unscrupulous bankers preying on certain folks, or just the people signing up for loans on homes they should have known they couldn&#039;t possibly sustain. &nbsp;Renters also make this mistake and sign leases for dazzling apartments that they later realize are way over their heads. &nbsp;It&#039;s a common mistake. &nbsp;Just much more rampant in the last couple of years for various reasons. &nbsp;Some say it&#039;s Greenspan&#039;s fault for crazy low rates. &nbsp;Whatever. &nbsp;But with solid finances, good planning, discipline, some sacrifice, and maybe a little luck - there are lots of ordinary people who manage to buy homes. &nbsp;And considering that their wealth potential increases over time, then the bills on that home become increasingly manageable. &nbsp;But it is tough. &nbsp;No doubt. &nbsp;You don&#039;t find too many newlyweds in their 20&#039;s buying a house unless parents provide a lot of help. &nbsp;<br /><br />I don&#039;t agree that a lot of Astorian homeowners will be selling short. &nbsp;I think it&#039;s a minority, in fact. &nbsp;Maybe people who bought at top dollar prices from 04 - 07 - with little down. &nbsp;And other people who got excited about their home value during that same time frame and took huge home equity loans. &nbsp;Those people may owe more than they can get. &nbsp;Maybe. &nbsp;Even then, I wonder. &nbsp;I think the majority of home owners in Astoria will make a tidy profit if they sell today.<br /><br />I also think there is a overriding assumption that money is drying up for everyone. &nbsp;Not true. &nbsp;And as someone pointed out, houses in Astoria are an absolute steal to anyone whose currency is the Euro. &nbsp;There is also the possibility that more buyers will flock to Astoria. &nbsp;Consider the &quot;yuppies&quot; as people here like to call them, who would normally buy a place in Manhattan. &nbsp;Now the bonus money is drying up a little bit. &nbsp;So their idea of cutting back is to look to the outer boroughs. &nbsp;We can see from the relatively brisk sales of any new condo that goes up in LIC and Astoria. &nbsp;The buyers are there - and they have the money. &nbsp;<br /><br />I guess I&#039;m not that pessimistic. &nbsp;Things go up and down. &nbsp;I don&#039;t believe that prices will drop by an astounding rate like 40% in Astoria. &nbsp;And I think the current economy will turn around relatively quickly following a new President and a resolution to the Iraq war. &nbsp;And when it does, the prices will level off and head up. &nbsp;So I think it&#039;s a dangerous game to sit waiting for doomsday. &nbsp;Time and time again people miss the boat and then wind up back in a situation where prices are out of sight. &nbsp;So if you planned on buying, now seems like a great time.&nbsp; Or at least a good time to start getting your things in order to reach that goal.<br /><br />Or like anzubird points out - that was a very good article.&nbsp; The mentality that one has to own a home may need to change.&nbsp; Unfortunately the tax code would also have to change, among other things.&nbsp; But it was a nice reminder that renting is a very sensible option for many people and should not be frowned upon.&nbsp; People really just need a home that makes them feel safe and happy.&nbsp; If it winds up being a good investment - then bonus.&nbsp; But that shouldn&#039;t be the drive.</div>

And guess who&#039;s feeding this to the press????&nbsp; The group really responsible but who doesn&#039;t want you to know it....the REALTORS!!!!!<br /><br />Banks lend money...that&#039;s what a bank is <span class="bbc_u">supposed to do</span>!!!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;What really happened was this: Greenspan lowered the fed fund rates, which led banks to lower thier interest rates to consumers.&nbsp; The banks were hoping that people would see the lower rates as an incentive to borrow more money.&nbsp; But after the dot-com bust, no one was biting.&nbsp; Everyone was keeping thier money close.<br /><br />Local realtors around the country saw this as an opportunity.&nbsp; If they convinced the local banks to ease thier lending standards, they could sell homes for more money.&nbsp; In turn, they used the ease of credit as a means to INFLATE THE PRICE OF HOMES!!!!&nbsp; At this point, the couple who could previously only get $200,000 in credit could now get a loan for $400,000.&nbsp; So what did the realtors do?&nbsp; Well, they bought up houses by the bushel for thier own inventory!!&nbsp; So now, that house that used to be on the market for $200,000 was given a few cosmetic updates for $50,000 and then sold for...guess how much....$400,000!!!!!&nbsp; Say hello happy couple to your new home!<br /><br />The sellers were happy to be making a profit.&nbsp; The buyers had &quot;equity&quot; (or so they thought).&nbsp; The realtors were making a ton off the commissions.&nbsp; The banks now had a ton of debt instruments which they could then resell to other larger insitutions (Bear Stearns, Countrywide, etc.), and even the neighborhoods were happy that thier home values doubled in only a few years.&nbsp; Everyone was happy.<br /><br />But please, don&#039;t blame the banks!!!!&nbsp; They don&#039;t asess the values on the houses.&nbsp; They don&#039;t set the initial asking price for the houses (the realtors do that).&nbsp; They didn&#039;t go door to door asking if anyone neeeded a loan!!!&nbsp; No...they only saw the line of people knocking on thier door and asking for a loan which they promised to pay back, because the realtors were all screaming on the radio, TV and the bookstores that <strong>&quot;NOW WAS THE TIME TO BUY!!!!!&quot;</strong> and told them to go to the bank and sign on the dotted line.<br /><br />And because the American Realtors Association is one of the largest lobbying groups in Washington, they have the power and means to then use the same media outlets and blame the banks for not having sufficient due dillegent processes, not explaining enough to the borrowers, not having tougher lending standards.&nbsp; No, it can&#039;t be the guy selling you the over-valued house.&nbsp; No, it&#039;s the guy giving you the money to BUY that over-valued house...IT&#039;S HIS FAULT!!!!&nbsp; <br /><br />BULLSHIT.&nbsp; Plain and simple.&nbsp; Don&#039;t let anyone else fool you.&nbsp; And since the banking companies do not have the same powerhouse lobbying groups on thier side, the Realtors can just walk all over them.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=11208.msg138515#msg138515">Quote from: TJT on July 08, 2008, 06:05:24 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I don&#039;t agree that a lot of Astorian homeowners will be selling short. &nbsp;I think it&#039;s a minority, in fact. &nbsp;Maybe people who bought at top dollar prices from 04 - 07 - with little down. &nbsp;And other people who got excited about their home value during that same time frame and took huge home equity loans. &nbsp;Those people may owe more than they can get. &nbsp;Maybe. &nbsp;Even then, I wonder. &nbsp;I think the majority of home owners in Astoria will make a tidy profit if they sell today.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>&nbsp;

Or at least a good time to start getting your things in order to reach that goal.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>1) There&#039;s is no historical basis to believe that a new Prez or and end to this war will turn this economy around.&nbsp; WWII can&#039;t even be used as a basis for comparison.&nbsp; <br />2) There isn&#039;t even a basis to believe that the Iraq war will end anytime soon...no matter who&#039;s in office.<br />3) It&#039;ll take more than those two things to go back up.&nbsp; There has to be a new &quot;boom&quot;.&nbsp; First there was the stock boom.&nbsp; Then the tech boom.&nbsp; Then the real estate boom.&nbsp; It&#039;ll take some new product to come up and allow for the free flow of money.&nbsp; What that&#039;ll be or when it&#039;ll happen, who knows.<br /><br />Sorry to tell ya chicken little...the sky IS falling...go find a hardhat !!!!</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_138599">I brought up the point that Europeans see New York as a bargain but let’s be real, they aren’t looking to buy in Astoria. They are looking to buy in Manhattan and brownstone Brooklyn – forcing those people who were looking in those areas to consider somewhere elsewhere, namely other areas of Brooklyn, and Queens (and other places). It’s a knock-on effect.<br /><br />NYC Goalie: super-thumbs up to everything you said – you are really spot on – but why give it an easy go on the banks? Are you serious that banks do not have powerful lobby groups? Who then was able to convince Congress to repeal any legislation resembling a rule or regulation on their business, which then allowed banks to lend at will without any consequence? They are just as guilty as the realtors in driving the bubble and twice as guilty in causing the melt-down of the banking system.<br /><br />Banks were more than happy making money by the condo-ful, earning fees on each and every loan they made to people who could afford them and to those people who couldn’t. It didn’t matter. <br /><br />Why? Because they then packaged those mortgages and sold them on as now virtually worthless securities to other financial institutions, who you’d think would know better being the professionals -- earning banks even more fees. The whole thing was a scam.<br /></div>
