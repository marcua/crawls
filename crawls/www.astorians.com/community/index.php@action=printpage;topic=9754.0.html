				Just curious to know if anyone knows about local farmers growing pawpaws? I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever had any, but a seed catalog came this week and keeps enticing me to hunt one down to try.

				Okay - maybe you know it by another name? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pawpaw<br /><br />It can supposedly be grown in colder climates in the US, so I&#039;m just hoping that somebody grows it here...<br /><br />And here are a couple of pictures:<br /><br />(http://www.ars-grin.gov/ars/PacWest/Corvallis/ncgr/minor/pawpaw.fruit.jpg)<br /><br />(http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Asimina_triloba_red_fern_farm.jpg)

				I&#039;ve heard of them but only in a song, I didn&#039;t realize they were a real fruit! They sound very interesting. <br /><br />This Ithaca NY blogger mentions having pawpaws in her blog: http://sustainablefoodblog.com/local_food/&nbsp; - it might be worthwhile to write and ask where she got them? <br /><br />You could visit the Brooklyn Botanic Gardens in September, and make a jump for the tree when no one is looking: http://www.bbg.org/gar2/topics/wildflower/1997fa_pawpaws.html (that page also has a list of nursery sources for pawpaws, they might be able to lead you to farmers who are growing them) <br /><br />You might also consider foraging. I.e., getting out into the wild, identifying them, and coming back when the fruit is ripe, probably September, to harvest. <br /><br />And, there&#039;s always the Ohio pawpaw festival. <br />&nbsp;

				I didn&#039;t realize pawpaws were their own thing. I always thought they were papayas. <br />Will keep my eyes out for them now.

				These sound very cool, wasabisam.&nbsp; If it&#039;s related to the delicious cherimoya, it&#039;s gotta be good!<br /><br />Try emailing Larry Rossi at thepawpawguy@msn.com (see this article (http://www.philly.com/inquirer/columnists/rick_nichols/20070927_On_the_Side___Lost_foods_reclaimed.html)).<br />
