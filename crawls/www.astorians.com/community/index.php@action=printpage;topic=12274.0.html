				Imagine living in homes behined the church and being woken up at 8:30 in the morning by resonating church bells that ring on for sometimes nearly two minutes with a noise so deafening that even with the windows closed you cannot muffle the sound.&nbsp; Imagine that one Sunday you are in a dead sleep and &quot;double&quot; sets of bells startle you out of a peaceful sleep, being rung 175 times at 8:15 am, then fifteen minutes later 152 times, then about 45 minutes later 35 times.<br /><br />And imagine that there is absolutely no rhymn or reason to the ringing of these bells, no dogma.&nbsp; The numbers of rings change from week to week; how long the rings last from week to week and the times they are run changes from week to week.&nbsp; This is what the neighbors who live behind this Monastery have been dealing with.&nbsp; <br /><br />Then there is the issue of this huge light that is posted at the top of the church that shines brightly into the bedrooms of its neighbors, so bright that even blackout curtains do not completely diminish its brightness.<br /><br />Despite numerous complaints and despite there &quot;promises&quot; to ring the bells later on Sunday and decrease the amount of times the bells are rung, they have not done so.<br /><br />Instead, they have forwarded complaints to their legal representative who has in his naivity believed St. Irene&#039;s when they told him they have made changes.&nbsp; They have not.<br /><br />It is a shame that, in the name of Christianity, that St. Irene&#039;s feels they can do whatever they choose.&nbsp; <br /><br />Is that they way your God wants you to treat your neighbors?&nbsp; Shame on you.

				I used to live behind those bells as well. They are the worst. I always thought they sounded like crazy, ominous bells from some awful 70s occult movie, the kind that might ring when someone is having a vision of the devil or having a traumatic flashback or something.&nbsp; I hope your campaign is successful.

				I am so thankful to you for being so honest and up front about this issue.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you really want to help, please help keep this posting alive by asking others who have experienced this issue with St. Irene&#039;s to please write to this posting.<br /><br />I am going to take whatever answers I get to someone I know who has contacts with City Council.<br /><br />They passed this problem onto their attorney, George Razis, who is inclined to believe that they have modified their ways.&nbsp; They have not.&nbsp; In case you would like to contact Mr. Razis, anonymously in support of the resolution of this issue, his phone number is 718.932.7500.&nbsp; His fax number is 718.956.0218.<br /><br />Your help and support is greatly appreciated.

				I founded NoiseOFF.org and while this problem might sound unique, it is not.&nbsp; One member of the group is a California woman who lives near a church that installed electronic bullhorn &quot;bells&quot; blasting the neighborhood several times each day, starting early in the morning.<br /><br />To add insult to injury, when she complained to the pastor about the noise, not only did he refuse to negotiate, she was vilified by the parishioners in the community.&nbsp; The local councilman conveniently sided with the church as well.<br /><br />The local newspaper covered the story and assumed that the church bell is an issue that should be decided by majority opinion; never mind that the family was adversely affected by the noise causing them pain.

				While you&#039;re at it, why don&#039;t you ask Amtrack to use rubber wheels on their trains and ask the FDNY to quietly exit their Firehouse.&nbsp; &nbsp;Both the train tressle and firehouse are within similar distances to you, yet it&#039;s the church bells that you have an issue with.<br /><br />Or better still, complain to the realtor that rented you your apartment.&nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;m assuming you were duped by a realtor because nobody in their right mind would move that close to a church, a train tressle and a firehouse without expecting a little noise.<br /><br />Remeber, every time a bell rings, and angel gets their wings.&nbsp; &nbsp;:mrgreen:<br />

				Your reply is ridiculous at best.&nbsp; Church bells can be a beautiful thing, if done with style and grace and some sort of theme, like the Catholic Church on Ditmars Blvd.<br /><br />This church rings their bells with BONG, BONG, BONG BONG BONG in double time.&nbsp; There is nothing pleasant about that.&nbsp; Read the posting because it seems from your response that you have not gotten the full impact of, not just me, but what my neighbors experience.<br /><br />As for my landlord, they are wonderful.&nbsp; I could not ask for better people.&nbsp; And, no, I do not feel duped.&nbsp; And your sarcacism regarding Amtrak, fire depts and ambulances lacks any basis in this conversation.<br /><br />Find another hobby instead of jumping on the bandwagon with something you know nothing about.

				I can sympathize up to a point but this seems to be a bit ridiculous.&nbsp; Did you actually sit and count the bells ringing 172 times?&nbsp; Additionally, many churches seem to be culprits of creating &quot;excessive&quot; noise at one time or another, like some Roman Catholic churches who actually ring their bells (or have electronic bullhorns) with religious melodies for as much as 5-10 minutes at seemingly random times.<br /><br />And the noise can&#039;t possibly be more annoying than the noise from Amtrak, the noise from the fire trucks, the noise from the airplanes from LaGuardia, the noise from the N/W line (especially if you live right near it...eeesh!), the noise from the motorcycles headed towards Astoria Park in the spring/summer, the noise from the trucks headed towards the industrial area around 19th-20th Avenue if you live near Steinway or along/near 20th or 21st Avenues, etc.

				But that was my point too: that this is the city, and that one has to expect a certain amount of noise in such an urban environment.&nbsp; My point was to compare the church bells with any other number of distractions that create noise, potentially much louder and much more consistent than some church bells every so often.&nbsp;

				The notion of &quot;this is the city, get used to it&quot; is the kind of cynical reaction that are usually dictated by people who themselves do not experience any noise issues.<br /><br />Residents have a right to peace in their apartment and neighbors have a civic responsibility not to cause noise problems for others.&nbsp; That includes houses of worship which are situated in residential neighborhoods.<br /><br />Noise pollution is not just an annoyance, it is a human health issue.

				I did read your posting and thats why i responded . The real estate guy and the landlord obviously rnt gonna tell you , we have loud bells , get your ear plugs on . Its up to you or whoever else lives there to know the area . If the church came in after you moved there then you would have a point. But i know it didnt .&nbsp; Churches hold alot of power&nbsp; and i dont think they will hold off those bells anytime soon. Maybe if they could do them a little later , who knows . Put it this way , most of the churches money is from private funding , meaning it comes from very rich people who hold alot of power in the community . Im sure you rnt the first to complain and def not the last&nbsp; , so if its still going on , it prob still will .<br />Get some good ear plugs , that may be your best bet if you choose to stay there .

				Your points are well taken.&nbsp; However, since their bells are not consistent in time frame or style, there is no reason to believe it is attached to any religious ceremony.&nbsp; They are simply wanted to raise attention to the fact that a service will be taking place, much like the Good Humor truck announces that he is coming around to sell ice cream.<br /><br />They bottom line is they could do it later, if they chose to.&nbsp; And that I could live with.&nbsp; But they will not because in the name of RELIGION, they feel they have license to be rude and inconsiderate.<br /><br /><br /><br />============================<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=12274.msg151012.html#msg151012">Quote from: thanos27 on September 17, 2008, 08:29:13 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I did read your posting and thats why i responded .

				I hear the &quot;It&#039;s the city, it&#039;s loud, get used to it&quot; argument all the time. It&#039;s not much of an argument. Research shows that noise affects people even when they believe they are effectively tuning it out. It increases your stress levels and makes it harder for you to focus, even if you don&#039;t realize it. <br /><br />Maybe you could find some nice loud bells to ring during their service :D

				Unless you know every single greek orthodox religious holiday than you cant say its not attached to ANY religious holiday or ceremony. You simply dont know that for a fact. Maybe they just had or are having a baptism that day ? maybe someone is getting married or its some sort of holiday or other &nbsp;religious day &gt; who knows .<br />Bringing up the good humor truck is making you sound assinign, since it has no basis in whats going on with the church.<br /><br />you know i have a friend who complains abt living under the train on 31st (as if he didnt know the train comes every 5 mins in the morning), so what he did is get a soft pair of earplugs, after a week u dont even know they are in . He also got a sound machine that has static white noise or rainfall, waterfall etc etc , it allows him to sleep really good in the morning since he works a night job

				I&#039;ve lived by airports, churches and under the infamous Amtrack. When I lived on Crescent off of 23rd Ave, there was a church behind my house. The bells sucked, but they stop. <br /><br />I grew up in the country and it took me a while to get used to the noise. It sucks, judy, that you&#039;ve got to deal with it.

				I have quite a few Greek friends and now the holidays very well.&nbsp; And my reference to a Good Humor truck still holds true.<br /><br />For instance, last Sunday they had a Wedding at 11:00 am.&nbsp; Bells started ring on 8:12am and again at 10:00 am, each time no different.&nbsp; Every holiday that the bells rang it was the same.&nbsp; There was a two week period where the rang every night, no change in the bells.<br /><br />I know what I am talking about.&nbsp; You do not.&nbsp; And you are missing the point.<br /><br />===============================================<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=12274.msg151026.html#msg151026">Quote from: thanos27 on September 17, 2008, 09:39:07 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Unless you know every single greek orthodox religious holiday than you cant say its not attached to ANY religious holiday or ceremony.

				Ok, I live on 37th and 23rd avenue and I can honestly say the bells have NEVER bothered me, and I&#039;m very sensitive to noise. <br />Does the chanting at the mosque also pork you off this much? <br />Id prefer church bells and intonations to ninja bikes screeeeeeeaming up my street or livery cabs blaring their horns at all hours of the day. <br />

				I grew up next to a church, their bells were of an automated variety that were pleasant to hear and went off at a set time. It was easy to tune out though.<br /><br />I&#039;d probably complain though if there was random bell ringing with no rhyme or reason. City noise is one thing, randomly annoying idiocy is something else. We had a bit of that on my street recently (a child running wild yelling), a few people went to talk to the parents and someone called ACS. It&#039;s been quiet ever since. <br /><br />amtrak and fdny were mentioned above in this thread... i knew what i&#039;d be hearing when i moved near the bridge. It&#039;s nothing. generally speaking emergency services don&#039;t let their sirens blare out like they used to 15, 20 years ago, late at night. This city is a lot more quiet than it used to be.<br /><br />As for that 24-217 Exemption, it should be revoked. Special treatment for anyone is just plain stupid.

				Everyone knows 10.00 Sunday a.m. is the perfect time to get out that chainsaw/ lawnmower / snowblower and do a little yard work. <br /><br />cause, you know, those bells woke you up (innocent look) and you figured you might as well get up and get some things done.

				I happen to think that chuch bell noise- real OR recorded- is a nuisance. Maybe if they rang out the time every hour, okay not so bad, and useful. But a cacaphony of pointless noise?? <br /><br />It&#039;s the CITY. So everybody put wind chimes up! Everybody blast their stereos and let the car alarms go wild and let your kids scream at will in the supermarket- hey it&#039;s the CITY after all!!&nbsp; :roll:<br /><br />

				Ok so i went to the church today since i had nothing else to do , and i asked the priest what was going on with these so called problems .&nbsp; He tells me&nbsp; sure , they get complaints but if those bells dont ring as they have been rung for thousands of years , he gets alot more complaints.&nbsp; 311 and the police basically say &quot;yea yea , we will do something &quot;, to basically quiet the complainers down and then nothing gets done since the church is &quot;above the law&quot; in bell ringing . <br /><br />And for whoever said , &quot;that church hasnt been there for thousands of years &quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;thats obvious .&nbsp; when&nbsp; someone says church it means the entire orthodox church as in this case . try and at least take an educated guess on something like that instead of just typing for no reason . <br /><br />The priest also told me those bells ring for funerals , births , holidays , name days&nbsp; and many more reasons , so i guess judy didnt know those things either .&nbsp; Also those bells are rung by hand unlike the catholic church on ditmars ,again like it has been done for thousands of years . Some things dont change in those churches and religion .So the old guy maybe lost count at 151 and you didnt . kudos to you.<br /><br />So basically your only choices as mentioned by many as i did is:<br /><br />1 move <br />2 earplugs and noise machine<br />3 deal with it <br />4 go to mass every sunday 8am ( if u cant beat em ,join&nbsp; em )

				In reading this message thread on Astorians, I am surprised by the level of vitriol against Judy and ignorance on the issue of noise pollution.<br /><br />Having founded a noise pollution awareness group, I often receive messages from desperate people who are dealing with noise problems so severe they have to have to sleep in motels at night or self-medicate.&nbsp; Not everyone can afford to move away or &quot;just get used to it.&quot;<br /><br />When people complain about noise, they sometimes become the target of others (especially those who are liable for the time and cost to mitigate or abate the problem) who either attempt to summarily dismiss the issue or invalidate the complainant because it is so much easier than actually addressing the issue.<br /><br />I hope the church will negotiate and an amicable solution can be reached.&nbsp; For the rest of you who disparage Judy, it is cowardly and speaks volumes about your contempt for your own neighbors.

				If Judy came to this site to ask advice or to seek support from people she might have received a more sympathetic reaction if actually asked for some. Instead she came to rant, and to name &amp; shame, in what I perceived to be an aggressive way (at least is seemed so to me) – the use of all caps in the subject line didn’t help.<br /><br />Now there&#039;s nothing wrong with a good rant, especially to let off steam, but in an open forum people will have differing opinions and if you shout at them, they usually have a tendency to shout back. <br /><br />I have complete sympathy for anyone who has to deal with noise issues in their homes. I moved from two apartments due to noisy neighbors, but it is a fact of life in the city, was it fair I had to move, no, but it is the way most people in New York deal with it -- and learning to ask the right questions from the next landlord and real estate broker. <br />

				This afternoon, I decided to visit St. Irene Chrysovalantou Monastery on 24th Avenue and 36th Street.&nbsp; Before I got there, I spoke with a neighbor about a block away and asked her if there was any problems with church bells.&nbsp; She said that church bells sound off in the morning but it was not a noise problem for her or her nearest neighbors.&nbsp; Except for the railroad overpass, the area is very quiet.<br /><br />When I got to the church, I spoke to a woman who was watering the front sidewalk and asked about the bells.&nbsp; She said that the bells sound off on Sunday mornings and once in the evening on certain weekdays for about three minutes.&nbsp; She directed me to the Church secretary, his office is across the street.<br /><br />I introduced myself and we had a nice conversation.&nbsp; He invited me to his office and explained that he met with Judy on the issue and they had reduced the bell ringing.&nbsp; He offered to speak to the bishop about the matter and see if they can work something out.<br /><br />Considering that I am a complete stranger asking about their bells, they were actually quite gracious.<br /><br />I never got a chance to hear the bells, so I am going to reserve judgment.&nbsp; I do hope that St. Irene&#039;s and Judy can negotiate and come to an amicable agreement.<br /><br />I am willing to eat a slice of humble pie if I sounded harsh in my last message.

				My partner and I once visited that church. We saw an statue of the Virgin Mary that was covered in watches. A sweet older lady explained to us that the watches (and other mementos, but watches were in the majority) were left when a pray was answered. These are not bad people. I doubt that their intention is to make someones life hell. <br /><br />When should the bells ring and for how long....I don&#039;t know. Every now and then, as I lay on my bed, I get to hear the bells of St Joseph (if the wind is right) flow over me on a quiet Sunday Morning. <br /><br />It&#039;s an interesting debate that I have seen take place over the years. Once, in a New England town, a couple sued because the Courthouse clock, which was out of commission when they moved in, annoyed them. They won and the clock was silenced. <br /><br />At work, across from the Jefferson Courthouse in Greenwich Village, I get to here the hours called out during my shift (it also tells me that it&#039;s 10 am and time to open the store. I enjoy those moments when that bell intrudes on my busy life. <br /><br />All the moments only say one thing, it is something I enjoy...but others may not. Should they compromise....I don&#039;t know. Should I compromise....I don&#039;t know. <br /><br />I will say this though....&quot;No Respect for Neighbors&quot; I doubt. Maybe they and Judy will reach a compromise.... I hope so.....because in this large mosaic of people we call New York City, It is the variety and the noise and the daily annoyances that give this city life....and I doubt that will change no matter where we live. Or what we silence.

				I agree with grklove that judy or whoever decides to live near a church&nbsp; ( and i mean right next to a church which she said she did ) or a school or railroad , train , factory , mosque , chicken coupe whatever will basically have to understand thats how it is .&nbsp; &nbsp;U cant silence the train or a&nbsp; church , which is also why churches are exempt from noice laws with the ringing of their bells. i mean they cant make the bells out of rubber .&nbsp; i see someone else also visited the church as i mentioned i did ,&nbsp; but my sources might be a little more open as they told me what&nbsp; they did .&nbsp; judy isnt the first or the last to complain on such issues&nbsp; and since its still happening with the bells , it prob still will in the future .&nbsp; i recently moved next to a shipping type of factory actually and it was a huge debate in my family and friends&nbsp; if i should do so . the choice was totally mine&nbsp; and yea sometimes its noisy but u know what ... I chose to live there cuz for me alot of other things made sense&nbsp; , so i took the chance and so far so good . Would be kinda lame if i then complained .

				The church bell noise wouldn&#039;t be so disturbing to learn about, if they were real or served a purpose like back in the day.

				Sorry, guys, but you are way off base on the noise and beating up on Judy.<br /><br />First the issue of church bells (and the like.)

				Judy…I have great sympathy for what you are experiencing, I really do, but take St. Irene’s and religion out of the equation and you are left with a simple dispute with a noisy neighbor, not an uncommon problem for people living in a crowded city.<br /><br />The problem I’m having understanding your situation is that you seem to be dismissive of anything anybody has to say, other then St. Irene’s should be condemned and be made to stop. If you want my honest opinion, for what it’s worth, I don’t think this is going to happen. The church has been there for many years, you have not.<br /><br />In the most sincerest way, I want to ask because I think it would be helpful to everyone to see your side: what outcome do you want achieved? If there is a compromise to be made what should it be?<br /><br />Also, you mentioned that that your landlord has been great. This may be true but don’t you think they should have warned you before moving in? I know this never happens in the real-world but they did have a duty I think. If they are as great as you say, they should at least be willing to let you out of your lease if moving out ends up be the only option.

				Oh pa-lese people, this is NOT a Judy problem, but a noise problem. <br /><br />Having the bells repeatedly clang for minutes on end seems to be less important than the feeling among some of you that the problem here is her - specifically her tone of voice does not seem to be polite, or dare we say, pleading enough? These are all arguements (or ploys) not to address the problem - the core issue is not her voice, but the bells. <br /><br />Get over it people. We can&#039;t all walk around here with a glazed eyes and a drooling grins. This community needs a lot more uppity Judys and a lot less whining and complaining (with people not doing anything about issues). <br /><br />In that sense, Astoria sticks out.

And you keep stating that those who do not agree with you are loosing sight of the issue....I am sorry, but I read your original comment several times....and it has to do with the church bells and how it is basically disrespectful of them to play them and disturb your sleep. Those that agreed with you and said the church should stop were thanked by you for seeing eye to eye and keeping on target. Those that disagreed, were told they do not know what they are talking about, and have no idea what you are going through, while several people on this thread admitted to living very close to you. You ask...why we think you should move....well it is simple.... YOU are the newcomer....not the church.... the church was there... and has been ringing its bells for years, and honestly, I hope it continues to ring its bells. Not to slight you, I feel bad that this has caused you so much grief, but in all honesty, you are a temporary resident here. You do not own the place where you are living, and most likely you will not be living in that apartment for the rest of your life. Basically what you are requesting the church to do, is to change its routine and customs to accommodate YOU. So when people tell you to either move or deal with it, it is basically the same as you telling the church to stop ringing its bells....or delay them until it is more suitable to YOUR needs. If this was as widespread an issue as you claim it to be and the whole community around you is in an uproar, and is startled awake and cant sleep all night because of ringing bells, then this problem would have been resolved long ago. It is sweet that a person involved in the city council decided to meet with you with regards to church bells, but I think it would better serve the community as a whole if you took up another issue that affects the neighborhood on a larger scale...and that would be the nesting pigeons on 23rd Ave under the amtrack tressle. - This last sentence I will admit is off topic.

				I think this discussion has disintegrated into the equivalent of an internet based food fight.&nbsp; Rather immature and assinine.&nbsp; I really doubt that the Church will do anything unless Judy you are able to round up all of your neighbors and go over there as a large group to speak to them.&nbsp; If it is you alone, I guarantee that you will not be able to stop an age old tradition.&nbsp; I suggest you put some fliers around the neighborhood, invite some folks to your house for a meeting, get a group going and make an appointment with the Church.&nbsp; It will require more than this silly back and forth that masks itself as a &#039;discussion&#039;.&nbsp; <br /><br />I lived on 62nd Street between first and second avenues.&nbsp; For years, I had to put up with so much noise coming from so many sources.&nbsp; In spite of the warnings of getting tickets for honking horns, this would happen incessantly.&nbsp; You know what, I simply gave up and moved away.&nbsp; The noise was there before I got there and I could not fight this battle.&nbsp; I am much happier now!<br /><br />Although your noise comes from one source, if you cannot stop it, and it is ruining your life and your health, you will have no choice but to either get used to it or to move away.&nbsp; Ranting may help for a bit, but from what I see, the posts are making you even more upset.&nbsp; Take a breather, take a walk and think about your next step.&nbsp; Good luck!

				&nbsp;:x<br />OK here is my advise <br />#1. try to record the bell ringing in progress , if they ring it even 50 time,s you would have made your case<br />#2. document every contact you made with the church regarding this complaint,what you did , phone calls , visits , with date&#039;s ,times names of who you spoke to,etc,ectand give that to your man in the city counsel.give him the name&#039;s and phone #r&#039;s of those you spoke to. if its on paper its always a plus :mrgreen:<br />#3. be realistic,it is a church , they have a bell and they are going to use it . the best you can hope for is they use it with discretion <br />#4 do research, find out what denomination the church is and goggle it, i hear wonderfull thing about this &quot;wikapedia &quot; thing . see if there are any mention about the rules of bell ringing&nbsp; , and what , if any significance they have <br />#5. try to muffle the sound ,someone suggested ear plugs&nbsp; try the foam kind not the rubber ones i think they would be more comfortable, possibly drapes ,the heavy kind would also help,possibly knit a coosie for the bell&nbsp; .you never know<br />#6 . try to be a more sympathetic figure , as someone who came in on page 2 of this thread ,i was sympathetic to you&#039;re cause .1/2 way down the 1rst page you made a good counterpoint to a poster ,but your very next post was unnecessary. by the end of the first page i know longer sympathized with you.by the end of the second&nbsp; ahhh.....well uhh&nbsp; lets not go there<br />#7 . get a petition going <br /><br />&nbsp;i hope this helps and was what you where asking for , hopefully this will end this thread and we can all live in peace once more<br /><br /><br />

				You are seen as a temporary renter to the church . You basically have little to no say , sorry to break it to you . Im kinda blunt , but like i said , you arent the first or the last to complain abt something like this&nbsp; , in which you shouldve known BEFORE you moved in . So because of your bad mistake&nbsp; and everytime someone doesnt agree with you , you say they rnt thinking like a human or to read your posts over and over again .<br />I think everyone knows how you feel already and know how to read well enough to not be scolded by you to go back and read again and again and again .<br />You can keep fighting it and i hope they come up with some solution , i dont think anyone here wants your to be miserable&nbsp; , since they wouldnt want it done to them . But plenty have pointed out after you said your landlord and real estate person didnt tell you or inform you abt the church (derrrrrr, as if they would ) .You havent taken responsibility in your actions which put you there to begin with . <br /><br />Let me guess im off topic and need to read your posts again and again and again....

				Wow, this was an interesting thread. Archie Bunker is still alive and living in Astoria.<br /><br />This exposes the problem that our community has with unofficial dissent. Everything has to be neat and tidy, or carefully staged and only instigated by the right people for us to sign on and get serious attention, no matter how inane the issue is.<br /><br />As our community evolves, and more Judys move in, these old certainties will erode and ultimately vanish. <br /><br />If anyone else out lurking out there has an issue, post away! A strong community is one where the public is fully engaged. Although that is certainly not the Astoria of today, there is no telling what is around the corner.<br /><br />Its fun to watch the mods, and a handful of locals try to keep the Genie in a bottle.<br /><br />&nbsp;:-D

				This morning, I had a telephone conversation with Judy over the church bells.&nbsp; She is dealing with a severe noise problem and have been unable to come to an amicable resolution with the church.<br /><br />Her residence is within close distance to the church bells which means that the bells can be heard and felt.&nbsp; It is not something that can be ignored or something you can get used to.&nbsp; This is very different than someone who might live away where the bells can be heard but not felt.<br /><br />She initially negotiated an agreement with the church secretary that the bells would not sound earlier than 9am and for a short duration.&nbsp; The church later reneged on that agreement and resumed sounding the bells at 8am and would go on for hours.<br /><br />When she complained again, they directed her to their attorney; he would not return her phone calls.<br /><br />In speaking with Judy, I found her to be reasonable and honest in explaining the problem.<br /><br />I do believe her.

She started off wrongly by naming her thread in all capitals. And after she yelled her rant at us, she became condescending and disrespectful to the thread readers and to individuals who felt she bore some of the responsibility for where she lived in proximity to the church. I have no doubt that the church bells are bothersome to her. I live right across the street from the 2 churches on the corner of 30th Road and Crescent Street. Many years ago a group of respectful adult members of the 30th Road Block Association asked both Pastors to attend one of our meetings to discuss the issue of the ringing of their bells. It was a meeting that produced an understanding of the situation and an agreement that abated the issue while still allowing everyone to walk away from the table feeling that there were no winners and no losers. The bells still ring, but not as often and not as long, and the respect the community showed the churches allowed them to hear our concerns without any threats, or whining, or the use or need for any attorneys. It was all accomplished in ONE meeting. We set no terms. They set no terms. we simply discussed the problem and resolved the issue. Apparently, Judy has made herself a one person committee, and perhaps somewhat of a PITA. That seems to indicate that her surrounding neighbors are not of the same thought as she on the subject, and she simply cannot expect to have changes made for one renegade neighbor. If this was a big a problem as she seems to indicate, she would have been able to rally ALL her neighbors to a meeting and then, purely based on numbers, the church might have responded in a more respectful manner.

				Good show, ddanny999!<br /><br />And as to Judy, this community needs more people with a little &quot;piss and vinegar.&quot;&nbsp; Leadership that wants to have everything nicey nice but without a creative thread in their head are destroying Astoria. This is not the community is was even five years ago. And I believe this attitude plays a significant role as one of the reasons this is so.<br /><br />Things are not nicey nice, a fact ignored by our newspapers, our community board, our elected officals and (dare I say) the mods of this board.<br /><br />You can ignore issues from some of the people all the time, and most of the people most of the time, but not from everyone all the time!

				St. Irene&#039;s may soon get competition if adhan and iqama is voiced via loudspeaker five times a day from the new mosque on the next block and the neighborhood experiences the old Balkan tradition of dueling cacophony.&nbsp; If there are any local noise ordinances, maybe they should be enforced now before we all lose our minds.

				When my husband and I decided to move to Astoria, we came over to the neighborhood at different times of the day and asked many neighbors about the noise on the Triborough Bridge.&nbsp; The neighbors explained all the pros and cons of living in the area.&nbsp; We made a decision to live here.&nbsp; Now, when there is drilling on the bridge all night, we have to put up with it - not much we can do.&nbsp; We did invest in new soundproof windows and some good earplugs!

				With respect to NYCMacUser&#039;s response, you do not realize that the only individuals being affected by this are those living in the house directly behind the church&#039;s bell tower which looms diagnally above the house.&nbsp; The other neighbors in surrounding homes would not be affected the same way.<br /><br />I promised an update on the church bells and here it is.<br /><br />This past Sunday the first set of bells rang at 9:42 and last two minutes and rang out approximately 173 times, the reason being because they ring a double set of bells.<br /><br />The bells rang out again at 10:47 and again lasted about two minutes, this time ringing out approximately 135 times.&nbsp; I left my house shortly thereafter, so I cannot be certain if the bells rang out again.&nbsp; I will find out and let you know.<br /><br />So this time the church bells rang later than they ever had, but just as long.<br /><br />I am going to continue to keep track of the times the bells ring and how often and hopefully I can report back each week that they are consistently ringing the bells at these same times and even perhaps shortening the length of time.<br /><br />Finally, I want to mention that as always, I could hear even with my windows shut, the entire service that was still in progress when I left my house - the bishop chanting, the singing, all of it.&nbsp; I sat for a moment and listened before I left.&nbsp; You get lost in it after awhile.&nbsp; <br /><br />This about the bells, not the service or anything else.<br /><br />DDanny 999 had a great deal to do with the change that took place on Sunday.&nbsp; DDanny and I spoke the Saturday before and after explaining to Danny the proximity of the church tower to where I live, he completely understood why it would affect just a few of us and not many of the surrounding neighbors.<br /><br />For those of you who think that my capitalizing the heading of the posting was my way of screaming out the problem, this is not true.&nbsp; I actually did it fso it would be noticed, but it was not my intention to scream out my anger at the church.&nbsp; I am not angry at the church. I am frustrated, but not angry.<br /><br />I appreciate everyone&#039;s comments and I do agree that, while it was out of pure frustration, I did come on like a bull in a china shop and for this I apologize.&nbsp; But my plight is true and my reasons are sincere.&nbsp; And I would encourage anyone, regardless of what your complaints or compliments might be to be productive and speak out because in the absence of something, you will get nothing.&nbsp; As for renters not having a right to speak out or that we do not matter, remember, homeowners depend on us &quot;renters&quot; for income and in Astoria we pay dearly for rent.&nbsp; And regardless of whether you own or rent, respect should be equally distributed.<br /><br />Thanks again to everyone who is participating in this posting.&nbsp; I appreciate all of you.<br /><br />Judy771<br /><br />

Most of the residents in this community are working class, where they take orders rather than make them. <br /><br />2. The machine: The political machine has a firm grip on the community. Newspapers rarely critique, but simply publish press releases from the politician&#039;s desk masquerading as news. Photographs inevitably show smiling politicians cutting ribbons and doling out money. It is almost impossible to break into this little clique. It is impossible for any ideas to see the light of day unless it is officially sanctioned. This encourages passivity and helplessness. <br /><br />The blogs and internet is turning this upside down, and may ultimately spell the death knell for this, but that is decades away.<br /><br />3. The reform movement: It doesn&#039;t exist. And where it does, is very targeted and community specific, such as in Greenwich Village. What is needed is an effort of outside funding for community catalysts to fan out an empower neighborhoods - very similar to the programs of Transportation Alternatives or the waterfront groups.<br /><br />Democracy, unlike the fear of darkness, is not programmed into our genes. It must be relearned with each generation. And people like Judy, instead of heaping scorn on her head, must be commended for reminding us&nbsp; this. <br /><br />This is a broad brush, and you can easily debate all these points (which I would encourage you to do). <br /><br />These problems are not endemic for Astoria, but, as in political passivity, a growing problem in our country.&nbsp;

				So the bar that you knew was there when you moved in is making noise and NOW you realize that&#039;s a problem and they should be stopped? And you didn&#039;t expect a bar would be noisy when you signed the lease?

So the needs of the few outweigh the needs of the many? <br /><br />You didn&#039;t do your due diligence when you looked at your apartment. I wonder too if your rent doesn&#039;t reflect the fact that you&#039;re situated next to the bells.

Would you be willing to pay extra taxes to staff agencies to go around and enforce the elimination of nuisances for everyone? Would you prefer living in a nanny state?

				To Astoristani - So you are yet another individual who ASSumes that I am a bitter woman.&nbsp; I suppose anyone, in your opinion, who stood up for what was right, would be bitter - especially if it was a woman.<br /><br />And where did you get the idea that I have been discredited by everyone who read this thread?&nbsp; Did you read just the &quot;comics&quot; section and forget about the rest?<br /><br />The &quot;few&quot; who do support me understood and stuck to the direct issues in their threads, as well as pointing out how perhaps I could have handled the beginning of the thread differently.&nbsp; However, nonetheless, the support was there.&nbsp; And clearly in their threads they used examples of individuals just like you who put a lot of words down on paper and have very little to say.<br /><br />Finally, you said, &quot;I can&#039;t help myself for wondering why this thread dominates this forum&quot;.&nbsp; Well, you answered your own question when you decided to jump on board:&nbsp; Because people just like you cannot resist the temptation to be heard, however baseless your remarks might be.<br /><br />Thank you.!<br /><br />

				To Kempstern NYC: Oh, and your response - that was your choice to attack me, right?<br /><br />It was established a long time ago that although it was not deliberate, this posting sounded like a rant because with I capitalized the heading.&nbsp; I realized I was wrong and admitted to that.<br /><br />As far as ignoring those who disagree, why should I?&nbsp; Nobody really wants to be ignored, do they?&nbsp; I treat people politely who are polite to me.&nbsp; If I am &quot;attacked&quot; as you put it, I attack back.&nbsp; Those who disagreed with common sense and class were those I took to heart and listened to.&nbsp; But those who chose to just call names and send insulting pictures that had no basis in this thread were, yes, responded to in kind.&nbsp; As far as your comment &quot;that an internet savvy person knows what that means&quot;, do you feel better now that you have had an chance to throw another insult out there? And thank you for admitting that you have previously made some &quot;snarky&quot; comments.<br /><br />Do you have something of substance to contribute to the conversation? Now that you have gotten this off your chest, is there something worthwhile you would like to contribute to this thread?&nbsp; <br /><br />===================<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=12274.msg152384#msg152384">Quote from: kempsternyc on September 27, 2008, 02:41:42 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I have a feeling that in every aggravating situation in NYC, one will find those who like what is going on and those who hate what is going on....

				I think the mods on this site should make more of an effort to encourage more serious debate and discussion. There are many serious issues facing our community, and almost no opportunity for the pubic to address them.<br /><br />The mods have a bad habit (in my opinion and experience) of letting people poke fun at an obviously upset person and not encouraging a thoughtful response to what (just might be) a legitimate complaint.

				You are absolutely correct.&nbsp; They don&#039;t want serious discussion or activism.&nbsp; I chose to do this because I thought it would helpful and useful to myself and others.&nbsp; But in reading other postings from other subjects, it blows my mind to see the distasteful, juvenile immature stuff they have allowed to appear.<br /><br />You and Gleason get it and some other responders do as well.&nbsp; But as an example, like this last person who said she would ring the bells even longer, the mods are responsible for encouraging that response allowing such responses to continue on and on instead of putting it to an end and keeping this posting intelligent and thoughtful.<br /><br />My mistake was that I even responded to some of these comments and pictures.&nbsp; Which is why I will continue to ignore the rest.<br /><br />Actually, I have requested that this thread be stopped because I see now, with the exception of a handful of individuals who &quot;get it&quot;, the effort was a waste of time.<br /><br />Anyone interested in responding to me with thoughtful, helpful ideas can respond to me directly.<br /><br />Otherwise, I just as soon have this thread removed.<br /><br /><br />=======================================<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=12274.msg152412#msg152412">Quote from: hillary10 on September 27, 2008, 02:59:40 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I don&#039;t think they do want serious discussion or activism.

				Judy, please let this thread stay. Its all been pretty useful. <br /><br />Open discussion is not something that comes easy but needs practice. Just because someone disagrees with you, doesn&#039;t mean they are a bad person, or if they accuse you of misrepresenting the facts does not make them right.<br /><br />This sort of thing rarely happens in Astoria. That will change over time with blogs and the like. I think everyone has benefitted from this thread. I encourage more of this.<br /><br />Oh, yes, in closing, let me relate to you the story that a good friend of mine told me a few months ago. He is Greek (and justifiably very proud of it), and had just moved to Astoria after getting married.&nbsp; <br /><br />The first Sunday in Astoria he woke up with the bells going &quot;KA-LANG, KA-LANG&#039; as he put it - not melodic at all but harsh, clanging. <br /><br />He moved as soon as he could. <br /><br />

				i think maybe if this church was judys religion there wouldnt be a problem.&nbsp; i might be right on that one since she is falling over herself to thank those who agree with her on this issue and ask them to speak out more so all can hear, but talks down and wants to silence those who disagree.&nbsp; maybe its judy who needs respect for the neighbors..

				Astorians.com is a general interest website open to anyone concerned with all things Astoria, from the serious to the sublime to the ridiculous and everything in between.<br /><br />It’s not a political action committee in my opinion and hopefully never will be. The website exists as an open forum with no agenda, it is instead a fun and welcoming place for people to hang out, share, communicate, learn, and meet-up -- people use the site in all sorts of ways and it&#039;s one of the reasons why it is a success.<br /><br />If political activism is your passion, you are more than welcome to state your opinion, promote your cause or publicize your action, as long as you do it within the board guidelines:<br /><br />http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=8222.0 (http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=8222.0)<br /><br />You’re also more than welcome to organize other users of the site to join you in support of your issue offline.<br /><br />But let’s be clear: astorians.com does not take sides, there is no agenda to set and it’s not the job of merm or the moderators to organize people or rally the community.

				Wow, what a long thread about bells.&nbsp; I - and perhaps I am in the minority - love the sound of those bells!&nbsp; I live about a half block from them, and hear them sometimes on mornings from my apartment.&nbsp; I think they are so interesting in their timbre and minimalism.&nbsp; They sound very ancient to me.&nbsp; I always enjoy them when I hear them.&nbsp; Conversely, I find the bells from the Catholic Church on Ditmars and 29th Street to be unremarkable most of the time.&nbsp; They play hymn tunes mostly, though the Bach tunes are nice.<br /><br />I am not posting this to disparage the OP, just making a personal observation.&nbsp; I&#039;m a musician, and have studied early music, and the St. Irene bells appeal (no pun intended!) to me because I enjoy the ancient music.&nbsp; I can understand how loud bells could be jarring to someone living next to them, and I&#039;m sorry the bells cause the OP stress.

				Some traditions just dont change ......&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;During the first three centuries when Christians were not free to worship, there were special messengers who went from door to door to announce the services.Because Christianity began as a forbidden religion [in the Roman Empire], it did not use bells until the fifth century when Bishop Pavlin in the city of Campana in southern Italy was the first to use them in Christian services. Some historians claim that it was Pope Sabinian of Rome who was the first to use bells.<br />In lands conquered by Islam, ringing church bells was forbidden and the church used the wooden board and hammer to call people together. Whenever Orthodox lands were freed of the Moslem yoke, the church bells joyously proclaimed their freedom.<br /><br />So no matter email , internet , phone lines , cells phones , fax and all that ,&nbsp; real traditions dont change .<br /><br />Like other have mentioned , they love the sound of the bells .&nbsp; For those who dont , then maybe that area isnt your best choice to live in .

				Funny, I was never rude or immature nor did I call you names yet you still replied very rudely to my posts twice. <br /><br />I&#039;ll say it again, perhaps you should look for a blog instead of a discussion board because you can&#039;t pick and choose what people reply to your thread. It&#039;s public and it&#039;s not a monologue, it&#039;s a dialogue. That would be akin to stading in a crowded subway car naked and getting angry that everyone is looking except for a select few you&#039;ve said are ok to look. You put this issue out into a public forum and you can&#039;t expect everyone to agree with you.

				Nice poem, but there are both male and female moderators (maybe instead of Mr. Moderator, just say Moderators, though that looses the Gorbachev reference).<br /><br />I do think Judy has a serious issue and is trying to find a solution to it, which has to be incredibly frustrating.&nbsp; Until a person has had to live with a noise problem, you do not realize how aggravating it can be.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think the discussion has been helpful in fleshing out people&#039;s perspectives, but folks are coming from very different places.&nbsp; I&#039;m hopeful that everyone can stay civil and respectful, remaining mindful of the board rules.

				John Donne, 1632<br />Meditation XVII<br />from Devotions Upon Emergent Occasions<br />Nunc lento sonitu dicunt, morieris.<br /><br />Perchance he for whom <strong>this bell tolls may be so ill as that he knows not it tolls for him</strong>; and perchance <strong>I may think myself so much better than I am</strong>, as that they who are about me and see my state may have caused it to toll for me, and I know not that. The church is catholic, universal, so are all her actions; all that she does belongs to all.<br /><br />When she baptizes a child, that action concerns me; for that child is thereby connected to that head which is my head too, and ingrafted into the body whereof I am a member. And when she buries a man, that action concerns me: <strong>all mankind is of one author and is one volume</strong>; when one man dies, one chapter is not torn out of the book, but translated into a better language; and every chapter must be so translated. God employs several translators; <strong>some pieces are translated by age, some by sickness, some by war, some by justice;</strong> but God&#039;s hand is in every translation, and his hand shall bind up all our scattered leaves again for that library where every book shall lie open to one another. <br /><br /><strong>As therefore the bell that rings a sermon calls</strong> not upon the <strong>preacher only, but upon the congregation to c<strong>ome,</strong> so this bell calls us all; but how much more me, who am brought so near the door by this sickness. There was a contention as far as a suit (in which piety and dignity, religion and estimation, were mingled) which of the religious orders should ring to prayers</strong> first in the morning; and it was determined that they should ring first that rose earliest. If we understand aright the dignity of this bell that tolls for our evening prayer, we would be glad to make it ours by rising early, in that <br />application, that it might be ours as well as his whose indeed it is. <br /><br /><strong>The bell doth toll for him that thinks it doth</strong>; and though it intermit again, yet from that minute that that occasion wrought upon him, he is united to God. Who casts not up his eye to the sun when it rises? but who takes off his eye from a comet when that breaks out? Who bends not his ear to any bell which upon any occasion rings? <strong>but who can remove it from that bell which is passing a piece of himself out of this world? No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent</strong>, a part of the main. If a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if promontory were, as<br />well as if a manor of thy friend&#039;s or of thine own were. Any man&#039;s death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind; and therefore never send <strong>to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee. </strong><br /><br /><strong>Neither can we call this a begging of misery or a borrowing of misery, as though we are not miserable enough of ourselves but must fetch in more from the next house, in taking upon us the misery of our neighbors.</strong> Truly it were an excusable covetousness if we did; for affliction is a treasure, and scarce any man hath enough of it. <br /><br />-=:Astoristani:=-

				I hear accounts of Jerusalem. The Jews, Christians, and Muslims all compete with each other. The bells and the calls to prayer etc create a din.&nbsp; <br /><br />Who cares what they did 1000 years ago? <br /><br />Again, bells are fine. And bells playing out a tune in the middle of the day reminds one of a college campus or the like. But ringing bells scores of times early in the morning, or bellowing out a call to prayer five times a day as some mosques will want to do (if that church insists on doing this) might just not have a place anymore in our community, and will less appropriate as the community evolves.<br /><br />We live in a diverse community today. Many people are not into religion. Its best to keep it for the most part a private affair within its tight knit community. Freedom of worship is NOT a right to impose.<br /><br />If she took this to court, should would likely win as others in similar situations.<br /><br />

				U mean U dont care what they did 1000 yrs ago , other maybe do !. Speak for yourself alone , cuz many people love tradition and are proud of having it passed down from generation to generation . Maybe many of your friends arent into religion , but many of mine are . Once again the church was there before and will be there after this traveler is done visiting this street . Dont be so sure the court would agree with you , like i said there have been complaints before and the bells still keep ringing .

				Yea a&nbsp; lot of greeks have moved out after coming here in the late 60&#039;s and early 70&#039;s and making their money , true . Astoria still has tons of greeks , greek events , greek owned businesses and greek owned real estate . After making their money in astoria , many greek families have moved to places like beechhurst, malba estates ,little neck ,great neck and manhasset among other top areas in longisland and queens for better schools and more room for their kids .Lucky for them they have those options&nbsp; . Astoria no matter what still has a huge greek population , much of which holds power and money in the community .&nbsp; Seems like gleason thinks astoria is going down hill ???&nbsp; Well please tell us some reasons its going downhill other than some vacant storefronts while our economy is probably the worst in the last 50 yrs .&nbsp; &nbsp;Is astoria so downhill that people (like some of my friends) who have bought homes in the last 4-5 yrs , havent made tons in equity already ?&nbsp; I know my cousin bought his house for 600k 4 yrs ago on ditmars and now has offers for 900k to sell even at this time of crazyness .&nbsp; Pretty bad for astoria property owners ...that&nbsp; must really make them wish their community wasnt in shambles .&nbsp; &nbsp;Rents in astoria are thru the roof&nbsp; and yet people still keep on moving in and renting for higher and higher rents&nbsp; ....another sure sign that the community is in dire need for a makeover . <br /><br />Ofcourse Astoria isnt perfect and probably will never be , but i would like to know how its in such bad shape ?

				Great posts by the last two posters . Seems gleason is very jealous of greek owned stores and greek owned businesses . So he decided to say the community is in shambles ..... well please tell us how it is in so much worse shape than other areas in this terrible economy ? The house next door to me sold for 950k 2 weeks ago .&nbsp; Is that a sign ? On my sisters block a 2 family sold for 880k ,while yet another is for sale for 850k with offers .&nbsp; Wanna hear what those owners had bought those homes for&nbsp; and how much profit they r gonna be making &gt;&nbsp; I guess those 2 families who bought and&nbsp; planned for years where to buy , made the wrong choices .&nbsp;

				I believe the Greek community&#039;s pride in their group is well founded. Every educated person has set foot on the Acropolis, if at least in their imagination. It is stunning when you compare the difference in the development of humanity before - and after - the Golden Age of Greece.<br /><br />And the impact of the community on Astoria is similarly profound. I have heard many times (non-Greek)people say &quot;the Greeks saved Astoria.&quot;<br /><br />But you should understand that the fate of your community will be no different than those that went before you. Already the community is starting to expand, to intermarry, to diffuse, to evolve, to change far beyond the borders of Astoria. And the experiences of those Greeks should not be less notworthy than the Astorians.<br /><br />I once went to do some research at the library, and needed to look up old newspapers. I saw century old ad after ad aimed at the German community (&#039;must speak German&#039; in everthing from midwifes to employees). And you know what struck me? You see the same things today but aimed at another new group: the Spanish.<br /><br />Although the Greek community remains vibrant and strong, there is little doubt that every year, its fades just a little bit, and like the English and Dutch and Germans and Slavs and Irish and Italians before, it will someday be all but a memory replaced by Brazilian, Bangladeshi, Andean, Middle Eastern, Balkan groups, who in turn, will make way for others.<br /><br />It is inevitable that all those cafes and stores and the like will gradually turn to the up and coming communities in Astoria. Accept it because it will happen whether you want it or not.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Not if house and condo prices keep escalating like they have been in Astoria . Not many will be able to afford it , unless grandfathered in . All ethnic groupe eventually move and the smarts ones , for the better . If u can afford it, y have your family of 5-6 in attached homes when a detached with huge backyard in LittleNeck or Manhasset awaits. Better schools and more room makes sense. I know tons of families that have done this . BayTerrace and Bayside Gables are&nbsp; filled with greeks ,&nbsp; check out and see what the homes go for there . Most of them have come from Astoria at one point .&nbsp; Remember how the south Bronx used to be &gt; ? it&nbsp; was all italian ,but now u wont find any unless its some 95 yr old couple that stuck it out . Astoria is a very strong community&nbsp; and its roots are based on its churches , schools and people who have one of the strongest connections to their history . A very proud history thaty allowed the world to advance for the better .

				St. Irene&#039;s is bad enough. But not as bad as the mosque on 23rd Avenue. Church bells, it can be argued, are legal under NYC law. But fiery sermons in Arabic at all hours of the day and night blasting from amplifiers that any heavy metal band would relish is another thing. I&#039;ll take the noise from the firehouse and Amtrak any day. This is the worst. It&#039;s Christianity vs. Islam, and the people of the neighborhood are the losers.

				out of all the threads of complaining and bitching on this forum, this one takes it for me. 15 pages of nothingness.<br /><br />Why did you move behind a church in the first place? Have you, as a mature adult, NEVER heard the bells of a church? <br /><br />You were stupid nough to move there, so you either pay up and break your lease, or deal with it.

				I don&#039;t understand all the anger displayed towards this woman.&nbsp; <br /><br />This just presents the classic nuisance situation: one party&#039;s use of a space is incompatible with another&#039;s.<br /><br />Arguments of &quot;coming to the nuisance&quot; -- that the complaining party &quot;should have known,&quot; or that the defendant &quot;was using the space first,&quot; are actually inapposite.&nbsp; While those arguments used to have merit, they&#039;ve been largely ignored by courts.&nbsp; Free speech or exercise of religion arguments also don&#039;t have any place here.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m sure this exact situation has been litigated many, many times in New York courts -- there has to be some precedent one way or the other.

				Maybe churchbells are an antiquated idea, anyway. What we hear aren&#039;t actual bells but a recording. It&#039;s not like the movie theater makes noises when it&#039;s time for the matinee.<br /><br />The church on Ditmars has nice &quot;bells&quot; that don&#039;t seem to be terribly loud, and they only play every hour.....when they play at all.

				A few things the renters posting need to know:<br />1) Greeks-Americans control Astoria. We control the real estate, the businesses, the politics, the gambling, everything.<br />2) No one cares about a bunch of renters complaining about noise. Absolutely no one cares. Not a single person of importance.<br />3) No one cares about Channel 7 news or the blogs or the NY Times. We have survived 2000 years of wars and were able to hand deliver western civilization to half the human beings on the planet. We really dont care if a reporter shows up with a camera. <br />4) Most of us actually dont even like that church. The politics behind it is complicated but irrelevant. It now our church. We will defend it like priests and laymen have defended the church for thousands of years. Its impossible for you to understand that. <br />5) In case your confused about our zeal for our church, read Freedom or Death. <br />6) There is nothing ethnocentric about any of this. Just reality. The weak vs the strong. Again, too complicated to explain.<br />7) Have a nice day. Thank you for living in Astoria.<br />

				As for the guy with the idea of Shame on You, no dude, we wont stop ringing the bells because Shame on You shows up. <br /><br />We wouldnt stop ringing the bells if 5000 Turks showed up, slaughtered the entire congregation, burned every house on the block down, cut the Bishops head off and put it on a flagpole. (All things that happened hundreds of time in Greece&#039;s recent history over the last 200 years.) As long as there was one Greek alive the bells would ring.<br /><br />The bells dont stop ringing dude. This isnt Sex in the City or the internet cafe. This isnt hand wringing and sexual identity crisis. These are the people that created the culture that allows you to breathe and live in freedom. Nothing personal, but if you eat our food and live in our neighborhood, you should learn something about our culture and history. <br /><br />Thank you.

				To my fellow Greek Americans - let&#039;s stop the drama. &nbsp;Astoria has changed and we have to accept it. &nbsp;There are still plenty of Greeks here but we certainly cannot claim ownership. &nbsp;I want to share a story with you -<br /><br />When I moved out of Astoria and went into Manhattan, I convinced my husband to move back and purchase a house here because it was becoming more &#039;hip&#039;, more youthful, a bit more cutting edge etc. &nbsp;I liked what I saw, young people from elsewhere moving in. &nbsp;Nine years later, I&#039;m not sure I like it anymore. &nbsp;I think I prefer the Astoria with unsophisticated, rough around the collar, working class immigrants who invested in Astoria years ago. &nbsp;I think I prefer people who did not complain constantly but were grateful to own a little bit of New York, who were happy with a fresh loaf of bread and a strong coffee, who did not criticize endlessly. &nbsp;I never thought I would agree with Gleason, but I miss the old days of families and people who seemed content with what they had.

				For the record, the biggest ethnic population in Astoria is not the Greeks, it&#039;s the Italians. Regardless of who has more people residing in the community, nobody controls everything, that&#039;s easily an overreaching statement. As for the church bells, I&#039;ve been to St. Irene&#039;s and I recall that they do go way overboard with the ringing. The neighbors are only asking for some moderation, I don&#039;t think that&#039;s too much to ask.

				I have been reading this thread from the beginning and have come to the conclusion that I agree with a few of the responses no one is holding you hostage in your apt or Astoria for that matter.<br /><br />I have lived in Astoria all my life and when I was growing up Ditmars was the spot but things have changed now it&#039;s 30th Avenue with all the cafes and restaurants. I live right off of 30th Avenue and let me tell you in the summer it literally takes me 30 minutes to drive home from my job on 47th street by the BQE, and when I invite people to my home they hate to come over because the parking situation is terrible, but these are all the Greeks that either moved to Whitestone, Bayside and LI that spend between 8 to 12 hours a day in Astoria either to work or play, but I really never got to understand is why they would move out of Astoria if you just go home to sleep and are right back here (Astoria) the very next day.<br /><br />So to all the people who complain I tell you this I LOVE ASTORIA and ALL the People if you looking for a neighborhood that is quiet please there is always, Whitestone, Bayside and L.I. but beware GREEKS ARE EVERYWHERE and THEY LOVE TO PARTY so GOOD RIDDINS !!!!<br /><br />Oh and by the way I am not Greek I am Italian and love the Greek Churches and admire that the Greeks hold on to there heritage and that the majority of there children all speak the language we should all learn from them, they are very proud to be Greek.

I doubt the ancient Americans or the Aztecs or the Mayans ever heard a Greek word!&nbsp; You&#039;re confusing a couple of things here.&nbsp; Alexander the Great did spread Greek culture and the Greek language far into Asia, further than anyone before him.&nbsp; And Greece, as an ancient power, had a tremendous influence over its neighboring lands.&nbsp; At the height of Greek civilization, it could be argued that the Greek language had the same worldwide influence that the English language does today, being that it was the tongue of the dominant power at the time.&nbsp; That said, Alexander the Great never conquered those lands, and Greek civilization stayed centered in the Balkans, the Mediterranean basin (North Africa, South Italy, the coast of modern-day Spain, Asia Minor, etc.) and around the Black Sea.&nbsp; So there&#039;s no reason why, say, Syrians could even claim that they are the descendants of ancient Greeks, just because Greeks passed through those lands in ancient times, for the same reason that you can&#039;t turn around and claim that modern-day Greeks have no relation to Ancient Greeks, just because the Greek territory was under the control of non-Greeks for several centuries.<br /><br />It is also wrong to say that Turks and Syrians, as a whole, are the partial descendants of those Greek (no need for quotations here, why did you include yours?&nbsp; Was Greek -or &quot;Greek&quot; as you so condescendingly put it - not spoken in ancient times?) peoples.&nbsp; Surely some are, but the Turkic peoples that formed the Ottoman Empire descended from Inner Asia, and many modern-day Turks (though obviously not all) descend from them.&nbsp; More to the point, Turkic peoples did not exist in the region during the time of Ancient Greece or even the Roman Empire, so any relation some modern-day Turks may have to the Ancient Greeks is by mixing with the people that were already in the region, who *did* descend from the Ancient Greeks.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the Turkish people, despite ruling over Greece for 400 years, did not adopt the Greek language or most aspects of Greek culture any more than the Greeks adopted Turkish as their native tongue.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Because a landmass in modern southern Europe continues to call themselves &quot;Greece&quot;

Of course, looking at your brief post history, your dislike of Astoria becomes quite evident, and one cannot help but wonder if that dislike extends towards a certain ethnic group that has long been associated with Astoria.

				Modern, Medieval and Ancient Greek who cares they (Greeks) have many true family values for example:<br /><br />Everyone that attends church is well dressed. I am catholic and let me tell you I have been to church lately and see women walk in with rollers in there hair how disrespectful is that.<br /><br />They all go for coffee at the cafes, again growing up in Italian household I remember on Steinway Street there was only Italian cafes and only men were allowed to go, Greek cafes are more family orientated.<br /><br />They (Greeks) children go to Greek Concerts and really enjoy the music.<br /><br /><br />If you live in Astoria you see that Easter is so beautiful in the Greek Orthodox religion as the have the procession of Christ on Good Friday&#039;s and how they celebrate Easter in general..<br /><br />Listen I am not prejudice but since I lived in Astoria all my life I only had he opportunity to compare Italians to Greeks, don&#039;t get me wrong I am proud to be Italian but there are differences with all nationalities.<br /><br />But I have to agree again with some of the people on this board that Greeks still own and operate a majority of the businesses in Astoria.<br /><br />So lets just end this thread because it&#039;s been going on for too long and everyone is entiled to their opinion and the right to speak their mind without insulting one another.<br /><br />It is what it is and I personally don&#039;t think that they will stop ringing the church bells at St. Irene and change what they have been doing for years to not piss off the renters, so unfortunately you have to deal with it or move.<br /><br />

				Since the moderators have requested that this thread go back on track, all I&#039;ll say, for the final time, is that there are many falsehoods and exaggerations in your posts and your replies to me.&nbsp; Also, just because you didn&#039;t quote me doesn&#039;t mean that you didn&#039;t put words into my mouth, as you did once again in your reply by assuming that I have never been to Turkey (I have) and that I am unaware of how many Ancient Greek and Ancient Roman sites are in Asia Minor (I am VERY well aware, thank you).&nbsp; As for Modern Greek, my point is that it has derived from Ancient Greek, much as modern English has derived from Old English.&nbsp; I doubt most English-speakers today would understand much of old English, but it is, at its core, the predecessor to the modern language.&nbsp; It is not &quot;completely different.&quot;
