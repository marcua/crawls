				The problem is that the patriot act is unreadable by mortals. &nbsp;Most of it consists of amendments to other pre-existing legislation - that's why one has to read an executive summary to get even the vaguest idea of what the act is talking about.<br /><br />You'd think that the authors would not bother with such cloak and dagger behavior. &nbsp;George W. Bush could drive cross country on a flatbed truck, naked and brandishing a megaphone, belting out &quot;I'm killing poor innocent people in Iraq, because my bosses in the white house say it will make them rich&quot;, and I don't think the country would bat an eye.<br /><br />Sorry, pessimistic cloudnine today ...<br /><br />-m

				You sir! &nbsp;Cake or death? &nbsp;Yeah, all this sucks, no doubt. &nbsp;Of course, what the heck does one do about it? &nbsp;I took a look at the aclu's patriot act primer to refresh my memory on the evil things this bill causes ...<br /><br />http://action.aclu.org/reformthepatriotact/primer.html<br /><br />I figure I can't do much about #1. &nbsp;Suggestions besides &quot;sell your worldly &nbsp;posessions and become an ascetic priest&quot; are welcome.<br /><br />For #2, I offer 2 ideas. &nbsp; a) drop the credit cards if you think you are under government scrutiny. &nbsp;use cash. &nbsp;b) Start a community wide library system. &nbsp;Some people in Richmond were setting up a library is their commune-ish house, and it seemed like a good idea ... you can meet people, AND read Harry Potter 6 for free!<br /><br />Suggestions are welcome for #3 <br /><br />For #4, I can make a few observations and suggestions. &nbsp;Use gpg to encrypt your email, and set up a trust ring with the people you email the most. &nbsp;Honestly, I don't do this myself yet, but i also have not been able to find anyone willing to join me.<br /><br />Use freezepeach to do your browsing of the aclu website. &nbsp;:)<br /><br />Consider using Tor: http://tor.eff.org/ for your home machine(s). &nbsp;Tor is a protocol/system which facilitates anonymity while sending data over the web.<br /><br />This is nutty, but may someday be necessary: create a community level local network ... everyone is connected together via linked wireless networks, and one responsible residence has a huge pipe to the real isp.<br /><br />Even more nutty, entirely possible, but less legal ... big community network, connected wirelessly, with Tor set up internally. &nbsp;Each participant in the network has a cable modem connection to the internet. &nbsp;With some routing fun (which at this point is beyond the scope of my knowledge), everyone in the network would be able to anonymously share each other's cable modem connection to the internet. &nbsp; If you request a web site, your encrypted data may leave the network via several different cable modems ....<br /><br />But all this requires effort. &nbsp;I'm not convinced that everyone (me included) is ready to pull out all the stops, and dissapear from the feds.<br /><br />OK, i'm done.

			<dd class="postbody">
				Forgive me for being hysterical; I was quite drunk when I submitted the last post, drunk and freaked out. Time is however getting short.<br /><br />I appreciate your suggestions for solutions cloudnine, except I don't think the enryption thing is going to work, even if everyone participated, which I'm sure they won't. If &nbsp;one's computer is seized then what is to prevent them from decrypting the information. I could be wrong, since I don't know anyrthing about encryption. But I can guess that if encryption becomes a problem for the various agencies then what is to prevent another &quot;Draconian&quot; law from being passed possibly outlawing the use of encryption technologies. This, of course, is speculative.<br /><br />As far as having a trusted member route or handle data, this is no safeguard at all. All the feds have to do is issue a subpoena and confiscate the whole lot. They've done it before without protest. Even when there is legal protection intimidation can work wonders.<br />http://www.volresource.org.uk/kcnews/news2,497.htm<br /><br />Many have said to me that if things get too bad here, they can always leave the country. I understand this sentiment and won't disagree. But it is also wise to remember that America has become a model of totalitarian behavior for the rest of the world, where before we represented democracy, we now represent the exact opposite and other countries are following suit. Look at England. Canada too. Even the bastion of all things free, the Netherlands. France, a former dissenter of the War has also succumbed.<br /><br /><br />With the recent innovations in identification both technologically and legalistically it will be impractical to say the least to separate oneself from the system. I'm thinking right now of the movie <span class="bbc_u">Code 46</span> and the sort of caste system that they depicted. I will say that cold hard cash is always good, but how many are willing to give up their credit cards?<br />Remember, under these laws all are potential suspects. And as far as libraries go, whose paying for them anyway? Unless a nationwide boycott and/or refusal to pay taxes that will go to libraries ensues... what am I saying?! &nbsp;We can't even refuse to pay taxes for military spending. I am envisioning a militaristic educationless society. Is it possible? How did we get here?<br /><br />I believe the only solution to this wholesale amelioration of our American, no <em>human</em> rights is to not let this law pass. How to do this, I don't know. Alerting the people we vote for is a good start. They do sometimes listen. I am sure they won't if nothing is being said at all. Will this be enough? I seriously doubt it. I have lost all optimism and mirth. Perhaps it is because I am hung over. Perhaps it is because we live in a repressive state where racism and violence are the norm. Perhaps it is seeing any hope for the American Dream crumble to dust, freedoms systematically eliminated right before our eyes without even a word of protest, sometimes not even a thought.<br /><br />I can only hope that what I'm perceiving is an illusion,<br />----zeno.<br /><br />@enigmacat: I have tried without success to find out the progress of the law or even a projected date of when the law is expected to be passed. Right now, I believe there are two versions of it. One from the House and one from the Senate. And I thought I was confused before, now I'm really confused :-). I will try to get some more information today as well as try to post something more useful (such as links to articles) than a rant.

The encryption is very good, and the keys themselves are encrypted, so even if someone did steal your computer it would be difficult for them to crack the code (provided you used a good password.) It's really fun to play with, but also very good to use in real life.

				To keep your computer data safe even if stolen or wrenched from your cold dead hands by jack booted thugs (FBI, CIA, ATF, or choose your favorite acronym) use a strong password (not your birhtday) and encrypt your drive. &nbsp;If you have Apple's OS X, you can encrypt your entire hard drive. &nbsp;You'll be out on parole from a very long prison sentence before anyone would be able to decrypt the data and the statute of limitations would most likely have expired.<br /><br />Is there a revocation of statute of limitations under the P Act?<br /><br />Let's not forget to never break the circle of trust.

				Congress Re-convenes.<br /><br />In the intervening months since this topic was addressed, I've had alot of time to think. Although I am a firm believer in the institution of laws to counteract terrorism and am also a realistic believer in security practices (in general) and a healthy awarness of one's surroundings, I have become even more convinced through re-reading this 132 page + tract that this particular law is inimical to human rights and our Constitution. I believe it to be in fact... illegal.<br /><br />However, (personally speaking) I have also lost the initial fire of emotion that I had first felt when the law was re-proposed. Lawyers from many different backgrounds have assured me that even if the law is passed in all it's all-encompassing Glory that there is yet still hope, and that it is not yet the end of civil liberties as we know them. The Act can always be modified or even overturned... and it is up to each Judge to determine in each case how prosecution is to be applied, if in fact it is to be applied at all. I still fail to see however how the War in Iraq has turned into the War against our own Citizens, but nevermind.<br /><br />What puzzles me the most is that this law has gained approval on the grounds that since it has been instituted we have not yet had another terrorist attack. Well, this is like saying (and let me wax whimsical here) that since a law was passed against earthquakes we haven't had any earthquakes, therefore the Act against Earthquakes has been successful.<br />While the rest of us cower in fear and let our bodies and homes be searched (an open book to the government) we are led to believe that the fact of an earthquake has become prevented by our Decree.<br /><br />Let me direct your attention, my fellow human beings to Beirut in Lebanon, or Palestine and Israel or Northern Ireland &quot;in&quot; England, or Athens in Greece. Or Cyprus. When did any <em>law</em> cause someone who was resourceful enough, determined enough and willing to die for a cause to desist?<br /><strong>Is it</strong> proper Logic to offer the Death Penalty to those who would attempt a Suicide bombing?<br /><br />And isn't the idea of American Freedom the very institution that we are trying to protect? In what world does the giving up of freedom bring freedom? In what universe does the initiation of war bring about peace? In what Dimension does the snuffing out of light mitigate darkness?<br /><br />These are philosophical questions that can best be posed when we are alone at home with our thoughts in front of the fireplace or when we are in prison awaiting torture or crucifixtion. These questions would have no place in a society that was under a Theocracy or (God forbid) a Leftist dictator's Regime :twisted:... too even think such thoughts would be most grievous <em>treason</em> &lt;hysterical emphasis&gt;. For now, I think such thoughts openly.<br />For now.<br /><br />(http://ranchacresbaptist.org/animated%20gif%20files/flag-transparent-large.gif)<br />-Zeno<br /><br />http://patriotwatch.org/

				Time is running out.<br />Kiss your American freedoms goodbye.<br /><br />Contact your legislators, start writing letters, protest.<br />Awaken your friends and family &amp; everyone around you that such a law exists.<br /><br />&quot;If you see something, say something.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;We are going to war to protect the peace.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Sacrifice a little freedom for security.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Be aware.

A law such as this could never affect <em>you</em> or someone <em>you</em> love. Go about your daily business. Think and talk about <em>pleasant</em> things. The U.S.A. P.A.T.R.I.O.T.

				ZENO: I admire your heartfelt post about the Patriot Act. &nbsp;I was very interested in it especially recentoy because in the news I heard that they are trying to extend it. &nbsp;Maybe there will be a fight in the Senate such as the recent discussion prior to their two week holiday sojurn. &nbsp;My understanding is that there were to motions one of which to take six month to pull troops out of Iraq and the other was to immediately remove troops. &nbsp;It sounded like &quot;me and Julio at the schoolyard&quot; meaning resorting to ridiculous tactics like a message from a representative that we should not be cowards and stay the course. &nbsp;<br /><br />stacey

One has to ask one's self whether all this tripping over shoelaces within the Bush administration has opened the door to criticism of his policies (iow Pure Chance) or whether in fact the ideal of freedom runs strong in the hearts of the American people and Congress no matter how &quot;charismatic&quot; the Leader is or how thick the atmosphere of Fear is which hovers over us.<br />I, for one, will be watching this on C-SPAN.<br /><br />I wish you well,<br />----Zeno.
