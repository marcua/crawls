				After a night of incessant blaring from a car alarm, we called 311 at 6:30 in the morning. They connected us with the 911 operator, who called out the police. They arrived in less than 15 minutes...after some investigating, walking around the car and looking inside, they actually broke into the car and disabled the alarm!!!! It was fantastic. A ticket was issued, though I don&#039;t know what for or how much. <br /><br />I&#039;m always intimidated by the notion of calling 911, but it was very nice to see 311 prioritize it as something to call the cops for. For the record, car alarms that don&#039;t shut off in 3 minutes cause &quot;Quality of Life&quot; violations which are under the DEP&#039;s jurisdiction. Cars can actually be towed for this. <br /><br />Thought you all might like to know, as you seem to be &quot;Quality of life&quot; people.

				Wow, I&#039;m glad someone&#039;s had success with this. My husband and I tried the same thing and the police just came and walked around the car a few times, asked the neighbor if they knew who it belonged to, and then drove away. I think someone from our block finally broke into the car and disabled the alarm.&nbsp;

				I too have a 311 success story. I have been calling numerous times concerning the &quot;No Parking&quot; and &quot;No Standing&quot; signs on 23rd Ave between 33rd and 35th Streets that were painted over a few weeks ago with black paint. Today as I was walking to the park with Bentley, I look up and lo and behold, new signs! YIPPEEE! They replaced all 8 signs that were painted over. Now if only they would do something about all the illegal parking there...

				Great work! I was having this problem in Sunnyside, a car that was never there before or again was going off all weekend. They got multiple tickets, and a lots of spit on their door handle, but it would have been great to see it towed or broken into.

				&nbsp; &nbsp; I have a great story too.&nbsp; Earlier this spring, I began to notice a very high pitched beeping coming through my bedroom window.&nbsp; After some investigation from my roof, I realized that a neighbor behind me had plugged in an electronic bird/critter repellant next to a patch of newly planted grass.&nbsp; I guess they were trying to protect their seeds from pests.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t mind this running during the day since I am not in my room very much. However, they ran it all night as well and it was starting to drive me nuts.&nbsp; I called 311 and after some difficult explanations to the operator, she transferred me to the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) since this was an &quot;environment&quot; issue.&nbsp; I re-registered my complaint and they said an investigator would reach out to me within a week.&nbsp; I must admit I wasn&#039;t too optimistic.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well shame on me!&nbsp; I got a call from an investigator the next day.&nbsp; He was understanding but also realistic.&nbsp; He said he would visit the neighbor but admitted that he couldn&#039;t legally do anything unless the sound was above a certain decibel level.&nbsp; However, he said he would ask the person to be a good neighbor and shut it off, which I appreciated.&nbsp; By the next day, I never heard it again!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

				This is so great to hear! I&#039;m on Crescent and 37th.<br />I intend to do some public thanking at the next 114 Precinct Community Affairs meeting. I talked to a traffic cop who writes tons of tickets for double parking, parking on sidewalks and the like,and they do like being thanked. Since I&#039;m a cyclist, I plan on giving a short speech on why street and pedestrian safety is a big deal, tell them that our communities are organizing to fix these problems, and ask for their continued support and due respect. I think they will be stunned. I don&#039;t know who goes to those meetings, but whenever I go to a Community Board, or Civic Association meeting, I&#039;m always surprised and impressed by community members who speak out. Lets Go, Astoria!!!!

				Don&#039;t get too excited thinking the police responded so quickly.&nbsp; I called 311 &amp; 911 at 1:30, 3:30, and finally 5:30 am regarding that obnoxious Mistubishi&#039;s car alarm going off all night for two nights.&nbsp; The police told me they got a lot of calls.&nbsp; Does anyone know how much a typical ticket is for that type of violation?&nbsp; As for the correct number to call, it&#039;s 911 (311 only redirects you to 911).
