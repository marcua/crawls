				I don&#039;t know if anyone cares, or are aware, but the radio station formerly known as Smooth Jazz CD 101 has changed from a &quot;jazz&quot;&quot; (quotation marks because I was told that it was sacrilege to call whatever they were playing there, jazz) station to a rock station.&nbsp; This happened about a month ago.&nbsp; I like this new station, although I sometimes miss the elevator music of the old CD 101.&nbsp; Actually, now that I think about, it&#039;s sort of like what K Rock used to be before Free FM&nbsp; (I have no idea what they are now as I stopped listening to them after Howard left and when they became a talk radio station; although I understand they went back to rock).<br /><br />Anyway, the rock music on 101.9 is vanilla, but I like it when you can hear Cure and STP in the same set.&nbsp; Sorry, that&#039;s just me.

				Hey- they are playing The Clash right now- that ok in my book. <br /><br />Just found this station on Sunday while driving in the car and was really enjoying it. Played a pretty good mix of music. <br /><br />My preference at work is Pandora or my ipod but it nice to have another option.

				None of them come close to what 92.7 LIR was though...that station was amazing!&nbsp; Jack FM came somewhat close with some of the music they played...now they are just on HD radio and online.<br /><br />101.9 RXP is kind of bland for my tastes.<br /><br />K-Rock is god-awful.<br /><br />Q104.3 has some legendary DJ&#039;s but the music mix is very vanilla.<br /><br />If anyone liked the dance music that 92.7 LIR played &quot;after hours,&quot; tune all the way down to 87.7 to hear Pulse 87, a new station that signed on recently that plays lots of new dance/electronic music and remixes.&nbsp; It&#039;s pretty refreshing to hear compared to the disco on KTU and the tried-and-true on most other stations.<br /><br />Reception in Astoria should be especially good, as Pulse 87 broadcasts from the top of the Citicorp Building in LIC.

				LIR and The Screamer of The Week! whoa, showing some age there! Even when it went through the WDRE (?) phase, then came back as a toned down &quot;original&quot; LIR, it was better than the AOR, Adult Oriented Contemporary Alternative, or whatever the format was called that proliferated. <br /><br />Larry the Duck, Malibu Sue, Donna Donna, Steve &quot;The Pistol&quot; Jones, et al....<br /><br />They were the cutting edge- songs I had already become tired of months before would suddenly become &quot;mainstream&quot; on every top 40 station.<br />and at the time, Astoria (at least my Apt.) was *right* on the limit of their transmitting power.

				Yeah, even in its final few years, up until it was sold in 2004, LIR was still far far better than almost anything on the commercial radio dial.&nbsp; Even if it was not what it once was in the 80s (which I missed out on as I was too young, but have heard in audio clips and &quot;flashback&quot; weekends LIR did later on)....it played lots and lots of artists that are not heard on commercial radio in the United States, and still broke out the obscure 80s new wave as well.&nbsp; Plus, the station had personality all day and all night, in an era where more and more stations are eliminating the DJ or voicetracking (pre-recording the DJ&#039;s words, then inserting them between songs in such a way that they sound like they are on the air &quot;live&quot;).<br /><br />Pulse 87.7 is a good station, by today&#039;s standards, though it&#039;s dance-specific.&nbsp; They&#039;ve already put together almost a complete lineup of DJ&#039;s...whereas in the past couple of months, there have been mass firings at K-Rock, CD101.9 (now RXP), Lite FM, Fresh 102.7, PLJ, WABC, WFAN, and other stations).<br /><br />Funny thing about them...87.7 is actually the audio portion of Channel 6 TV.&nbsp; Anywhere you go in the country, if there is a channel 6, you can hear its audio on 87.7 FM.&nbsp; In Pulse 87&#039;s case, Channel 6 is a low-power TV station, and quite frankly, the TV signal is pretty awful....I&#039;m not sure all of Astoria can even receive it, even though they broadcast from Citicorp in LIC.&nbsp; So they are using the audio only as a radio station, and the video currently just has test bars, I think, though there is word that they might put a studio cam or music videos (synced with the music on the station) on the video portion soon.<br /><br />Gotta commend them for thinking out of the box and getting something different on the air.&nbsp; Now if only 92.7 LIR could make a return....&nbsp; :-D

				Ah, a couple of more things...LIR definitely did break out music long before other stations did, right up to the end.&nbsp; I recall, for instance, they were playing Maroon 5&#039;s first hit a year and a half before Z100 broke it as &quot;new&quot; music.&nbsp; <br /><br />LIR&#039;s signal unfortunately wasn&#039;t that great in Astoria.&nbsp; It was actually because it was broadcasting from the Queens-Nassau border (North Shore Towers...those tall buildings you see by the Grand Central Parkway), but with only 2000 watts, compared to the 6000 or so watts the stations from the Empire State Building put out.&nbsp; Plus, Astoria being right next to Manhattan is blanketed really well with the signals from the ESB, the noise of which would drown out &#039;LIR.<br /><br />I remember my home stereo on Ditmars Blvd. would get them with a fairly clear signal but always in mono.<br /><br />Interestingly, as you headed towards Upper Manhattan and places like Fort Lee, NJ, or south towards Staten Island, the signal would come in clearer again, as the Empire State Building signals would begin to weaken as you went further away from it.<br /><br />As for the music on CD101.9...that was NOT jazz.&nbsp; Phil Collins?&nbsp; Booker T?&nbsp; Marvin Gaye?&nbsp; Smooth, perhaps, but not jazz.&nbsp; It&#039;s really just a &quot;brand name&quot; that radio stations across the country use, without having much to do with reality.&nbsp; <br /><br />If anyone is into &quot;real&quot; jazz...there&#039;s non-commercial stations like 88.3 and 89.9 in the NYC area and 90.1 on Long Island which play heavy doses of it...especially Jazz 88.3 out of Newark.<br /><br />Yes, I am a radio geek, I know&nbsp; :lol:

I&#039;m sure it&#039;s easier for radio to travel over water (I sometimes can get CT radio stations when driving to jobs out there), but still. If I went north of I-95 though (which is pretty much always within a mile of the coast in CT), I would lose it. I miss LIR!!&nbsp; :cry: That was my fav station of all time. I STILL miss it. And it reminds me of my first car, because that&#039;s all I listened to in that thing.<br /><br />Back on topic, I was scrolling through stations and came across 101.9 the other day. I didn&#039;t realize it used to be a different format, but I totally made it a preset :)

				i kinda like the new rock station too.&nbsp; in the times i&#039;ve listened, they play a pretty decent mix of stuff, especially the stuff you don&#039;t normally hear.&nbsp; i don&#039;t listen to radio that often these days, but from what i&#039;ve heard, they don&#039;t repeat a lot of stuff.<br /><br />aw, the good &#039;ol days of lir/dre.&nbsp; it was always a treat when that station came in clearly enough to really listen to.<br /><br />i also used to really like wapp (103.5, i think).&nbsp; they played an awesome mix of rock music back in the day.<br /><br />and why did they have to get rid of jack...i thought they were pretty good too.&nbsp; those &quot;bitchy&quot; promos were hysterical!

				I have lived in the city for 7 years and have never found a radio station I could stand listening to for any length of time, that is, until 101.9 Rock came along. I am sooooooooooooo happy. I&#039;ve been spending the majority of my down time lately lying in my room, listening to the station by candle light with a glass of vino in my hand. Ahh. Close to Heaven (please note the cross reference to 2 Cure songs). <br /><br />I am not a hermit, but have been in need of some &quot;me&quot; time and this new ritual has answered my call. <br /><br />I was on LI for a week this summer and found an amazing rock station that faded just as I approached Astoria. I can&#039;t recall what it was, could it be the LIR station that some of you&#039;ve been talking about or is that one of the stations that is now defunct? Sorry, somewhat confused. Perhaps because I haven&#039;t finished my first cup of coffee yet :lol:

				I loved CD101 at the beginning when it was a true contemporary jazz station.&nbsp; Over the years it became more and more a lite-fm wanna be, with smooth vocals (ugh).<br /><br />I miss the old station a ton, the recent one, not so much.
