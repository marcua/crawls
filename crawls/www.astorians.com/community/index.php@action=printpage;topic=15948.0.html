				I&#039;m a little confused about how co-ops work. Is the maintenance fee the loan amount you&#039;d pay back? Or is that on top of what you take out from the bank?<br /><br />Like, is the $871 your monthly payment, or would that be on top of the say, $700 you&#039;d be paying on the loan?

The mortgage interest payment is tax deductible which would commonly comprise 35% to 65% of your total maintenance In the Coop you don&#039;t own the apartment but you own the actual building or complex...well, you are a partner.&nbsp; Unlike a condominium that you get title and deed you will get shares and a proprietorial lease which basically gives you the right to occupy the apartment you live in.&nbsp; Your Mortgage is totally separate than your maintenance and just like in any real estate property you will have the benefit of writting off your finance charges as well.</span>

				Also, the maintenance will include your portion of real estate taxes as well as utilities (in this case).
