				I&#039;ve been meaning to check out Ovelia for months, and made it there today for brunch.&nbsp; We thoroughly enjoyed it - the food, service and environment were all pretty great.&nbsp; We sat in the back section which has extremely comfortable restaurant chairs (relatively uncommon I find), which are different from the ones up front.&nbsp; I was happy with the music which was inoffensive and SOFT.&nbsp; Nice to be able to comfortably have a conversation.&nbsp; Very reasonable prices as well.<br /><br />I took a look at their other menus and will definitely be back for dinner sometime soon.&nbsp; Great variety, and some good options for vegetarians (like me) too.&nbsp; <br /><br />My hubby loved their housemade sausage, by the way.<br /><br />

				Just wanted to reply to this because I was about to post a similar thread. I got brunch at Ovelia with my mom and brother yesterday, and it was great. Interesting Greek/American mix of brunch foods.. very nice menu. Service was laid back but not negligent. I got whole wheat banana pancakes with the Ovelia sausage, and I was very happy.
