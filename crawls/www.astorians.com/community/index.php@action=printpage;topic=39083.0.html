				I walked into this place yesterday and got way more than I expected. The food and drinks are nothing like the usual indian meals I&#039;ve had before.&nbsp; They say it&#039;s a three course menu for $33 but there&#039;s a lot more than just three courses. The mushroom soup I started with wasn&#039;t even on the menu. It&#039;s &quot;just because&quot;. Rice and naan is included and it ends with three indian desserts. I got the goat curry with turnips--never seen it on an Indian menu before and it was delicious. I hope this place is here to stay...Did I mention beer on tap and the bar is open till late?&nbsp; &nbsp;:cheesy: :cool: :cool: :cool: :grin: :grin:

				Also somewhat related - I&#039;m just dubious of people whose <em>only </em>post is a rave review of something.<br /><br /><br />I agree about the name.&nbsp; Curry Culture sounds more intriguing.<br /><br /><br />And the cuteness of pretending to be so local you can say &quot;30th and 36th&quot;.&nbsp; Is that 30th Avenue at 36th Street, or 30th Street at 36th Avenue?

				Back to this restaurant, a third friend of mine tried it last night and was raving about the experience from the cocktails, to the menu, and the food/service.&nbsp; I plan to go in the next few days.&nbsp; It sounds very good to me. The name is cutesy but that could have been an attempt to show that they&#039;re not really a traditional Indian restaurant.&nbsp; Everyone I&#039;ve spoken with says this place is unique and surprising, in a good way.

				braun: Great question. Of course we don&#039;t have a $33 price for everyone who walks in! We have a full service bar with beer on tap, wine, and specialty cocktails.&nbsp; If you sit at the bar, you can order off the bar bites menu AND/OR you can order any of the sides on the pre-fixe menu. People are really appreciating the creamy black lentils, alu gobi, butter chicken, chicken tikka, prawns, and various breads available at the bar. There are more options, I&#039;m just naming a few. So yes, it is completely possible to relax at the bar (open till late) and have a complete meal for less than $33. <br /><br /><br />Hope that helps and we hope to see you soon! If you do go, I&#039;d love to hear what you think!

				Hello baglover30: <br /><br /><br />I&#039;m vegetarian myself and can offer you some recommendations to try off the menu. My personal favorites are the Manchurian Cauliflower (you can read all about this dish in our Yelp reviews) and the Sweet and Sour Eggplant. Other standouts are the Shakarkandi ki Chaat (with a sweet potato base) and definitely the Creamy Black Lentils. Rice and naan are included with your order. This is a sampling of the vegetarian options. You will find more on the menu, which you can find on our Facebook page. Thanks for your question!<br /><br />

				I had it a few weeks ago. Was interesting. In a good way. The Manchurian cauliflower was excellent.
