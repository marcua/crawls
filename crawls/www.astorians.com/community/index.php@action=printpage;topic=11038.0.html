				I just had a bagel with lox and cream cheese at Brooklyn Bagel on Ditmars. Excellent, to say the least.<br /><br />But it was very pricey for me at $7.15 (I&#039;m new to the area).<br /><br />Now I want to make my own stellar lox and cream cheese bagel sandwich. What are my best bets to make this? Where to go for lox, cream cheese and fresh bagels? <br /><br />---<br /><br />I meant cheap or quality lox. :)&nbsp; I don&#039;t know much about lox and would love to find out more.

				Lox is the one of the very few things I&#039;ll actually buy at a super market.&nbsp; They have them all ready and sliced in 4oz. packages.&nbsp; Its not really cheap and you probably shouldnt go bargain hunting when eating fish&nbsp; :lol: but its alot cheaper then buying it out.&nbsp; If you are near ditmars, Best Yet is probably a good option for it.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure if the supermarket under the elevated has it.&nbsp; <br /><br />When I make my lox bagels, I always give the lox a shot of lemon and then top it off with onions, capers and a bit of pepper.&nbsp; The capers are key for me.

				OMG...there is a MUCH BETTER PLACE and much more reasonable AND IT&#039;S A SMALL FAMILY OWNED BUSINESS!!!!! &nbsp;<br /><br />It&#039;s on Ditmars between 29th and 30th street, I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s the west/east/north/south side, all I can say is that it&#039;s on the same side of Starbucks (just a block before). &nbsp;If you get there early they&#039;re still HOT, you can actually see them make it and everything is made fresh.<br /><br />Give them a shot, you won&#039;t regret it!!!!!!!!!!! &nbsp;I go there all the time, their everything bagel is soooo good especially when it&#039;s right out and still hot, better than toasted!!!

				Right on Liz, those folks make a much better bagel than Brooklyn Bagel or the neighboring Bagel House.&nbsp; Its the south side of Ditmars between 29th and 31st.&nbsp;

				Regardless of who you think makes the best bagel, the key part of the question was about lox. And the answer is, regretfully, don&#039;t eat lox. Almost all salmon is either severely endangered (the West-coast salmon fisheries are closed this year because they&#039;re so depleted!), or farmed in unsustainable ways. Regarding farmed salmon, take these quotes from this op-ed from the Times (http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/09/opinion/09grescoe.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin):<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I have come to believe that the farmed product is not a healthy alternative to wild.<br /><br />Three Norwegian-owned companies dominate the salmon-farming industry in North America, and their offshore net-cages dot long stretches of the west coast of the Americas. In Chile, overcrowding in these oceanic feedlots led to this year’s epidemic of infectious salmon anemia, a disease that has killed millions of fish and left the flesh of survivors riddled with lesions.<br /><br />The situation in Canada, which supplies the United States with 40 percent of its farmed salmon, is not much better. In British Columbia, offshore net-cages are breeding grounds for thumbtack-sized parasites called sea lice. In the Broughton Archipelago, a jigsaw of islands off the province’s central coast, wild pink salmon are infested with the crustaceans. Scientists think that the tens of millions of salmon in Broughton’s 27 Norwegian-owned farms are attracting sea lice and passing them on to wild fish, killing them. They say that this infestation could drive Broughton’s pink salmon to extinction by 2011.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Unless you can get lox made from wild Alaskan salmon (which is in good shape), the ethical thing to do is to avoid it entirely. :(<br />

				Some supermarkets will sell lox trimmings, little pieces that were cut off the ends to make nice, neat-looking slices.&nbsp; These pieces taste just as good as the whole slices and they tend to be much cheaper.

				That&#039;s because my parent&#039;s best friends are Jewish so I spent a lot of time there (their kids are my age) and practically grew up there, even observed Passover with them.&nbsp; They would always offer to make me a hamburger, etc. but out of respect (I was at their place) I always said no, so I learned how to eat all the delectable jewish food...they&#039;re from Argentina like my Dad but heritage is Russian so.....Yummmy.&nbsp; As a matter of fact I was at their place last night visiting and ... she cooks soooooooo good.&nbsp; We&#039;re practically family.&nbsp; So...yeah I know a few recipes :-).&nbsp; &nbsp;Noodle pudding...I&#039;m craving that, lol. <br /><br />

				I buy wild-caught salmon slices/packs of 4 and 8 oz. in Trader Joe&#039;s.&nbsp; And nowhere near you, but Bravo also has wild caught salmon from Canda, I believe, in their fresh fish section, also cheaper than Marino&#039;s or the supermarkets if you&#039;re ever on that side of Astoria Blvd. And if you&#039;re not concerned about the slices or whether it&#039;s farmed or wild, I second goldfish&#039;s boy remark about the unpretty ends in those plastic containers-good in a pinch and super cheap.

				Sammiches, here is a great cheap idea.&nbsp; You buy a small amount of smoked salmon from anywhere, you are poor so you won&#039;t be&nbsp; snobby (no offense).&nbsp; You buy some cream cheese and mix it with the lox in the food processor.&nbsp; This way you get a lot out of a small purchase. You will have lox spread for a week.&nbsp; Yummo! (Rachel Ray is hot but what a yutz!)<br /><br />Enjoy.
