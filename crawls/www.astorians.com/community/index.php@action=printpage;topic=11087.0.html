				Ok, so I was doing my usual morning browsing of the headlines when I came across this: http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080626/ap_on_go_pr_wh/us_nkorea (http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080626/ap_on_go_pr_wh/us_nkorea)&nbsp; Can someone tell me if I am missing something? Why the sudden turnaround? One day North Korea is a part of the axis of evil, as Mr. Bush put it, and the next we are having trade with them? Granted I have never agreed with pretty much anything Bush has said or done, and all these sanctions against places like Cuba, or North Korea or Iran don&#039;t have any effect on them since trade will be done with other countries and, as we all know, the USA isn&#039;t looked upon very well due to its forein policies, but who&#039;s the flip flopper now!!?!?!

				RTFA. The N. Koreans agreed to turn over a list of their nuclear activities to China, as part of the longstanding six-nation diplomatic talks. In exchange, the US will lift some sanctions they had in place above and beyond the UN sanctions (which will remain), and drop them from the list of terrorist sponsors (which is appropriate, as there&#039;s not much evidence they&#039;ve done any of that in a number of years). I think that this step is to be commended.<br />

				<br />&#039;Trust&#039;, but Verify.<br />N. Korea may be making huge steps forward this week.<br />And, President Bush gave a fine speech this morning. <br /><br />(Though still mangling language when answering questions. Like I should talk.)<br /><br /><br />The talking heads were asking how is the situation in N.Korea different than with Iran.<br />Other than that, I think Bush has been fairly consistent in this regard.<br /><br /><br />I imagine most were somewhat familiar with the six-nation talks. A good model for future diplomatic initiatives.<br /><br />

I don&#039;t know, who this &#039;we&#039; is, but, I know that I have no&nbsp; compulsion to advance a foreign policy that is approved by&nbsp; N&#039;Korea, Cuba and Iran.<br /><br />Now, Bush, put Iran, N&#039;Korea&nbsp; on the list. They got the message, at least in part, when we followed&nbsp; through on Iraq, Afghan. Even some not on the list, got the message, like Libya.&nbsp; The reactors&nbsp; and the N&#039; Koreans policies&nbsp; did not change, cause&nbsp; Madeline Albright went to have coffee with Kim Ill, nor&nbsp; did&nbsp; it change just with sanctions. Still, I find it odd that&nbsp; sanctions&nbsp; against&nbsp; Soth Africa&nbsp; and Dafur&nbsp; are &#039;approved&#039;&nbsp; as agent of change, while&nbsp; against&nbsp; nations like Cuba, Iran, N&#039;Korea it&#039;s&nbsp; considered&nbsp; ineffective or&nbsp; even &#039;illegal?&#039;
