				Hey Group,<br /><br />I thought this article was interesting.&nbsp; I would like to know, especially among the members who are Catholic and follow the social and political aspects of the faith, what you think about this pope and how he might compare with past popes, in particular the iconic Pope John Paul II.&nbsp; What do American Catholics think about this pope?&nbsp; <br /><br />http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/14/world/americas/14pope.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin<br />

I still consider myself Catholic, even though I find myself disagreeing with many social stances the Church has taken over the years. I&#039;m confident, though, that the next pope will be a step in the right direction.

				Some of the most wonderful progressive Christian movements came from within the Catholic church - just look at the Catholic Worker and Dorothy Day.&nbsp; Not all Popes have been right wingers.

				Vatican 2 was started by a fairly liberal pope... then he suddenly died very early after becoming pope.<br /><br />I can understand the pope being anti-abortion, the catholic church is also anti-war and anti-executions, but to still be against birth control in this day and age is a little behind the times.&nbsp; Its no wonder that the number of catholics in the western world is going down.<br /><br />I think its time the catholic church re-evaluates how it picks its popes, cardnials and bishops.&nbsp; Currently the pop is picked by the school of cardnials, who sit around until god lets them know who should be pope.&nbsp; Oddly enough god picked the most powerful cardinal, Ratzinger, over clergy who would be considered more popular with the rank and file.&nbsp; What are the odds.

And this wasn&#039;t some progressive NYC school, either. This was a suburban high school in the middle of a very Conservative Republican community. Birth control is one of those issues where most Catholics just let out a big sigh and ignore it. But yes, they really must change their stance. It&#039;s shameful.<br /><br />I&#039;d also like to point out that Catholics also believe in evolution and are not biblical literalists, something many people seem to forget. You know, because all us Christians are alike.&nbsp; :roll: (btw, that wasn&#039;t directed at you, heff...just needed to get that off my chest.)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I think its time the catholic church re-evaluates how it picks its popes, cardnials and bishops.&nbsp; Currently the pop is picked by the school of cardnials, who sit around until god lets them know who should be pope.&nbsp; Oddly enough god picked the most powerful cardinal, Ratzinger, over clergy who would be considered more popular with the rank and file.&nbsp; What are the odds.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Agreed. One of the rumors I heard after the election of Ratzinger was that he was chosen because of his very advanced age. If he turns out to be an unpopular pope (which seems to be the case), the Vatican won&#039;t have to deal with him for very long and, in the meantime, can figure out what their next step should be. We shall see.<br />

				They are also pretty behind the times in not letting priests marry.&nbsp; &nbsp;Or letting women be priests.&nbsp; And then they wonder why there&#039;s a decline in priesthood.&nbsp; &nbsp;I was raised Catholic, but consider myself more spiritual than religious.&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty liberal in my views, and this often clashes with many religions.&nbsp; If I could find a more inclusive church, that would be better.

				They are also talking about purging the priesthood of gay men, even though that could end up being a rather large percentage of their ranks.&nbsp; I remain surprised that they won&#039;t let priests marry or allow women priests.&nbsp; I wonder when they&#039;ll ever get to the point where they permit that.

I don&#039;t know if this is across the board, but last summer sometime when I was at my parent&#039;s house in Bridgeport, I picked a bulletin off the kitchen table and read it (I&#039;m not Catholic anymore, but my parents go every week). I was shocked to read a blurb about how evolution, The Big Bang, etc are fallacies and Darwin is a &quot;man of satan&quot;. Ugh.<br /><br />I remember once, when I was like, 7 or 8, I asked a priest in religion class how it was possible how everyone in the world came from Adam and Eve. He explained to me that the Old Testament was stories that people made up back in the day because people didn&#039;t have science to explain things. Made total sense to me, even at that age. Now? He&#039;d probably be shot or something for telling a kid that :(

				Youch - Wisconsin Synod is very scary.&nbsp; <br />The ELCA is open to LGBT members and ordains gay priests, though I think officially they are supposed to be celibate, though I know many of them, and they don&#039;t seem to be following that rule.&nbsp; We haven&#039;t won on gay marriage in our church yet, but I think that&#039;s only a few years down the road.&nbsp; Lutherans Concerned, North America (LCNA) is fighting for equality for LGBT folks in the church and making a lot of progress.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure on abortion, I&#039;ve never heard any discussion of it in the church.&nbsp; I&#039;ll find out.

				Thanks for the info, McDirk,<br /><br />Yeah, the Wisconsin Synod is pretty conservative.&nbsp; I remember my mother being all happy because the woman had to wear skirts or dresses that went below their knees to church and church related functions!&nbsp; <br /><br />The Missouri Synod, in my opinion, which was formed by 18 years of indoctrination, is just plain old mean-spirited!&nbsp; <br /><br />Hey everyone, the Pope is in Brazil!

				I grew up in the Wonder Bread of church: United Methodist. In the Midwest. The blandest, most benign church ever. Chicken and biscuit dinners, rummage sales, and the &quot;Grace Home Companion&quot; which is a take off on the Prairie Home Companion. My parents perform in it every year and used to make me do it with them. The church never preached against anyone, yet when the most recent pastor spoke about accepting gays, my old Sunday school teacher stood up and shouted &quot;That&#039;s blasphemy&quot; and stormed out. Since then there has been a mass exodus from my old church. Sad. <br /><br />I think the Vatican has done some awful s___, like telling people condoms don&#039;t prevent AIDS. Or pushing legislation that lead to the abortion law in El Salvador that sends women to jail if they show up at the hospital with a perforated uterus. That&#039;s unconscionable.
