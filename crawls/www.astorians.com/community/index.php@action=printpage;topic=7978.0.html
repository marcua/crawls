				After some of our previous conversations about policing in the neighborhood, I think you guys will appreciate this one.&nbsp; It has come to my attention that a guy who calls himself &quot;Jimmy Justice&quot; goes around filming NYPD Traffic Enforcement Agents breaking traffic laws.&nbsp; He confronts them directly in his videos, and then posts them on YouTube.&nbsp; Here is a segment about him on &quot;Countdown with Keith Olbermann,&quot; flagship show of third rated cable newsnet MSNBC: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyACkTTn8Ho&amp;NR=1<br /><br />Anyhow, what is your take on this guy, Astorians?&nbsp; Mine is that while it&#039;s infuriating that NYPD employees openly violate the law, Jimmy Justice is a major tool.&nbsp; And those of you who have been reading the thread about The Andrew Meyer know what happens to tools.&nbsp; :evil:<br /><br />For more of his videos, check out his YouTube Page: http://youtube.com/user/JimmyJustice4753
