				I have not posted in a long time but this is making me pretty incensed. I cannot be the only person who notices all the yuppies in Astoria bringing their kids...and often BABIES into restaurants.&nbsp; Everyone always bitches about the stroller moms and their bugaboos in Park Slope and the like- a problem in Manhattan as well, but not as much- (parents who feel guilty about getting a babysitter since they work all the time and take their kids to highly inappropriate places like expensive restaurants). Why is this ugly trend seeping into Astoria? 2 weeks I have gone into 2 different restaurants with my friend here in Astoria.&nbsp; One is a WINE bar- where somoene came in with a 3 year old on a Friday night at like 9 pm.&nbsp; 1) Its a WINE bar- why would you bring a kid there? its not fair to other patrons OR the child&nbsp; 2) Shouldnt the kid be in BED at 9 pm?&nbsp; Just putting it out there.&nbsp; This was Winegasm, by the way.<br />Last night I was in another place in Astoria where a couple came in with a BABY. Yes baby. I don&#039;t even think a year old.&nbsp; They proceeded to put the couple and the baby in the corner and I noticed no one sat near them.&nbsp; That place also has a bar and is an ADULT restaurant.<br />Am I crazy here? Does anyone remember the days where parents were sane and left kids home with the babysitter, friends, relatives, etc. while they went to restaurants?&nbsp; My parents would have never dreamed of taking us to places like that- its no fun for a child, the hours they are going to these places are ridiculous and if the kid gets fussy (understandably) - they piss the other diners off. Why would you do this? I feel like they are trying to prove something- like its possible to have it all? Well, fyi... it is not possible to &quot;have it all&quot; in a wine bar if that includes your two year old sticking his/her fingers in the brie on the fruit and cheese plate.<br />This is why Applebee&#039;s and TGIFridays are around. Two words: kid friendly.

				And I can&#039;t be the only person to note it&#039;s a bit ironic for you to blame &quot;entitled yuppies&quot; for ruining your experiences at a wine bar or expensive restaurant.<br /><br />Why is it okay though for the same thing to happen at Applebee&#039;s? I can&#039;t help but think you&#039;re sounding like an &quot;entitled yuppie&quot; in this situation. &quot;How dare they bring children into my fancy night out!&quot;<br /><br />Like most people I too find screaming babies and the like in a restaurant (somewhat) late at night rather annoying, and questionable in its wisdom, but I think it&#039;s getting to the point where the people constantly griping about &quot;yuppies&quot; or &quot;hipsters&quot; has gotten way more annoying than the targets of their complaints (or blame).

I don&#039;t think it is necessarily has as much to do with them being &quot;yuppies&quot; or &quot;hipsters&quot; or &quot;transplants&quot; or whatever term you like as much as the total lack of consideration for others. IMO, expectations are reduced at restaurants like Applebee&#039;s because they tend to be more casual and family oriented. Similarly, if I am dining earlier in the evening I would expect more children in family-friendly restaurants. I suppose maybe I was raised in a different time (although I am all of 27) because I know that you don&#039;t have to take your children around everywhere like a fashion accessory and there are places that are appropriate for adults (whom need time to themselves) and for families.

				Thanks RedSoxFanNYC. Yes you and I were apparently raised in the era where there was adult time and family time and its ok for mom and dad to go on a date sans junior.<br /><br />TAG: thanks for your response. And I have plenty of family and friends who do agree with me.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t be further from an entitled yuppie. I like a diner as much as the next person and if a kid is screaming there, hey it may be annoying but so be it. Its a DINER. And I do like kids.&nbsp; I do realize the hipster/yuppie bashing has gotten a bit extreme (of course there is a reason for it sometimes) but if these people weren&#039;t yuppies but were greeks or whatever, than whatever.. that isn&#039;t the point. The point is entitlement. When you have kids you make sacrifices, and they don&#039;t want to make any.&nbsp; And you may want to go to winegasm at a late hour but to bring your kid there is selfish and stupid - it disrupts the kid&#039;s schedule and its just...inappropriate. Its not the kids, its the parents. Suck it up and order chinese. You don&#039;t want to move to the &#039;burbs and pollute with the SUV, that&#039;s all good but let your kid be a kid.&nbsp; I think it also plays into that whole NYC-kids-eating-sushi-at-two-playing-the-violin-at-3-applying-to-20-preschools-so-they-can-hopefully-get-into-Harvard-and-will-have-the-PERFECT-life.&nbsp; I feel alot of time its about status, status, status and showing off their kid as an accessory (as RedSoxFanNYC said).<br /><br />The diff with applebees? It has a KIDS menu and at one point I believe had paper placemats for kids to color. I fail to notice that at the establishments I mentioned.<br /><br />And I saw a very well-behaved 8 year old at a v. nice steakhouse in the village a couple of years ago.&nbsp; Difference: the kid was 8 and it was 5 pm on a Saturday.&nbsp; I was v. impressed with the child&#039;s behavior.&nbsp; The diff is these people are bringing toddlers and infants into these places late at night on a weekend night and that&#039;s just insane, especially when the places are primarily bars.

				Well for the record I completely agree that many parents seem totally inconsiderate. I just don&#039;t think it&#039;s specific to any specific class or group of people though. I see all kinds of babies screaming on the subway at 1am (usually not yuppie babies FWIW) or late dinner at whatever time and can&#039;t help but wonder what the hell is going on. Children running amuck and screaming at my local diner is uncalled for, whether or not they have a kids section on the menu (I can&#039;t recall). <br /><br />It seems to me more of a general lack of courtesy and consideration than any specific sort of entitlement, and I see it in all economic and cultural groups here. It&#039;s part of the general &quot;parents/kids these days&quot; discussions that are quite common. And there exist multiple shelves of books on the subject at most bookstores (maybe not in our lone bookstore in astoria). <br /><br />Speaking of winegasm I went there this evening and immediately felt low income. That place is not moderately priced... I think even including cab fare from manhattan it&#039;d be a better deal to go into the city (and I don&#039;t have any young kids to inappropriately bring!). On the other hand, Broadway is quite a dirty and noisy mess these days. Kinda depressing.<br />

				As the mother of a two-year old, I was ready to get on the defense when I read your post, but I have to say I agree with you 100%.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if I qualify as a &quot;yuppie&quot; or not (I&#039;m a stay at home mom, so I guess the &quot;P&quot; is missing).&nbsp; We take our daughter to Igloo for brunch, and occasionally to Sakura around 5, when it&#039;s empty (she likes miso soup).&nbsp; But I would never, ever have her out at a wine bar (or anywhere else for that matter) at 9. She&#039;s fast asleep by then!&nbsp; We do go to the Beer Garden on Sunday afternoons though. 8-)<br />

				TAG I do agree kids today often act quite bratty- lack of discipline. And no, I don&#039;t believe in smacking kids around either.&nbsp; I am sure there are tons of books on this!<br /><br />We can agree to disagree on the yuppie thing&nbsp; :wink:<br /><br />And I agree with Winegasm. My friends and i said the same thing. May go back for a glass of wine, etc. (2 of us actually split a meal that wasn&#039;t outrageous) but we had some $20 appetizer sampler split btwn the 3 of us- crackers and spreads and it was NO food for the price.&nbsp; Most wine bars are really expensive I find but being that I am really into wine I wanted to give it a try.

				sweetlilyg: I wouldn&#039;t characterize you as an entitled yuppie (not that it should matter if I do!).&nbsp; And even if you worked outside the home- I am not ridiculously old-fashioned. I have relatives who could be the picture of yuppiness - both work, do EXTREMELY well financially (wife is a pt doctor) and have 4 kids and live in this huge house in a very wealthy suburb. Sure they eat organic meat, but the kids also eat cheetos off the floor of the family car.&nbsp; To me, yuppiness and entitlement is more an attitude that anything else and you kinda know it if you see it.<br /><br />Miso soup at 5 pm, why not? You are raising your child in the city with probably some of the most diverse restaurants int he world. Nothing like getting her started early.&nbsp; But you seem to get it- wine bar, fancy restaurant, whatever.&nbsp; And what bugged me most is it was baby and toddlers.&nbsp; Having a toddler sitting at a raised table/bar, right next to couples (some of whom were behaving a bit intimately) is kinda funky and weird.<br /><br />The beer garden on the other hand&nbsp; :-P Well, I guess there are always the hamburgers there!

Hmmm<br />My views as a parent may have changed me, but if a host / hostess said &quot;would you prefer the table next to a family with a toddler or a couple becoming intimate?&quot; I&#039;m thinking the table with a toddler. Plus at 9:00 PM, give a toddler a little wine and they are lights out. Try that with the couple sucking face and I don&#039;t know where that would go.

				No one hates pda more than me. But when you go to these places or REAL bars - yes I saw a kid in there as well - Indigo on a Fri nite (who knows how that happened)- you don&#039;t know what you will see and I don&#039; tknow why anyone would bring a small child in there to begin with.

				Even worse than restaurants is people taking babies to movies. As if the baby gets anything out of it. It&#039;s not limited to NYC or yuppies at all; it&#039;s merely arrived here from everywhere else. I agree that it&#039;s annoying. It&#039;s too bad that most people would probably consider it to be unPC for businesses to have &quot;no babies&quot; rules.

				I agree its mostly not orig New Yorkers- alot of transplants, particularly from certain regions of the country.<br />Movies are pretty rough. I saw some movie late last year- forget which- R rated, sex scenes, lots of swearing, and somebody brought a small child into the 9 something showing. I was just like ????&nbsp; I guess the kid was so young maybe he just fell asleep or didnt&#039; get it? An 8 year old or 10 year old probably would have had more questions.<br />PC or not- I think that would be good.&nbsp; And some restaurants do have it- just seemingly not here.&nbsp; Vegas (an area that is continuously being disney-fied to, I guess, appeal to a wider audience and make more money), for example, has a number of restaurants with a &quot;no kids under 5 rule&quot;.&nbsp; Most kids that age can&#039;t sit still anyway and what can they eat? Especially if its a fixed menu, for example.

				I have no problems with folks bringing their kids out.&nbsp; If the kids behave in a way which is in accordance to the venue and the parents accept the fact that there will be drinking, cussing, outside smoking, girls in skirts and guys trying to look up them then why not?&nbsp; I have no compunction about carousing on in front of a wee one because atleast my activities are natural, unlike the 2000+ murders they&#039;ll see on the television before they hit 5 years old.&nbsp; Better to bring the kid out, socialize them and be able to spend a spontaneous evening out without having to fuss over a sitter.&nbsp; &nbsp;Leads to well adjusted kids and longer marriages.&nbsp; Entitlement is bad, but trying to just enjoy the city with due consideration is fine by me.&nbsp;

				I disagree about the transplant thing. I&#039;ve lived all over NY in my life and everywhere I&#039;ve lived I&#039;ve seen babies (little babies in strollers) out at all hours... 2am, 3am, 4am, you name it at a lot of inappropriate venues. When I lived in the shittiest neighborhoods I would see toddlers out on street corners at 1am.<br /><br />It does bother me to see infants and toddlers in the Beer Garden on a weekend. There&#039;s so many people smoking and people get so loaded and it&#039;s so loud there it just doesn&#039;t seem like an environment I would ever take an infant. It&#039;s a little raucous for babies IMO. <br /><br />I agree it does have something to do with the thinking now that life doesn&#039;t end when you have a child. SOME activities do. I agree that people should just get a babysitter or sacrifice and don&#039;t go out. But people will do what people will do. <br /><br />I don&#039;t mind kids in most restaurants, if the kid was being loud I&#039;d just ask to move my table or deal with it. But wine bars and bars is another story.

				In my experience, it doesn&#039;t get too raucous at the beer garden on Sunday afternoon (unless you count all of the kids running around), and we just try to keep a distance from any tables that are smoking. In fact, the beer gardens around the city (there used to be many) we meant to serve as family venues, particularly on Sunday afternoons. But, you are entitled to your opinion, and I respect it. :-)

				I&#039;m not sure about Sunday afternoons as I&#039;ve never been there in the afternoon. It would make sense that in the afternoons it would be more of a family environment. I was referring more to the people who bring babies there on a Saturday night at 9pm when everyone is loaded and cursing and smoking.

				I&#039;m a 45.75 year old hag that has raised three kids and I&#039;ll tell you one thing. &nbsp;It doesn&#039;t matter if you have the BEST behaved kid in the world, at &nbsp;9:00 p.m. or more they become irritable, they&#039;re tired, kids spend way more energy than we do and even if the parents have their kids accustomed to going to bed late, kids will still be irritable.<br /><br />When I was growing up there was family time when the whole family did things together and then there was grown up time when Mom and Dad went out either alone or with friends...and if my parents had a soiree it was on a Friday or Saturday in the evening, we had to stay in the room and be in bed at our normal bedtimes and God forbid we broke that rule, we could only go out to use the bathroom.<br /><br />When I was raising my kids I never took them to a movie...period. &nbsp;I found a baby sitter or sometimes my mother would offer to watch them. &nbsp;Once they got interested in cartoons and could watch a whole show that&#039;s when I took them to the movies to watch KID MOVIES. &nbsp;There was &quot;family time&quot; and there was &quot;grown up time&quot;. &nbsp;We went to restaurants that were for families, never went to any place that was for adults with the kids.<br /><br />Going back to my parents...you could say that back in the day they would be what is today&#039;s &quot;hipsters&quot;, they were ummmmm &quot;groovy&quot;, if you ever watched an Austin Powers movie you&#039;ve seen my parents apartment and their lifestyle, I lived that life!!! &nbsp;Yet they never thought they were &quot;entitled&quot; or had the &quot;right&quot; to do as they pleased. &nbsp;They were coolio but they respected other people and even though they knew they could take us anywhere...like my father used to say &quot;Just because you can doesn&#039;t mean you should :-)<br /><br />

Maybe you just got a bit heated there. There are certain points I agree with (take your kids to your friend&#039;s restaurants, sure! But maybe not later at night on a Friday or Saturday) but others that I think are irresponsible (you can&#039;t really be ticked off at commuters trying to get around your kids and out of the way. I think it would be more responsible to teach them how to deal with people in a rush than to get mad at the people in the rush).

				Wow bushynose, we are feeling a bit possessive.&nbsp; If I wanted to play your immature game, I could be like &quot;well my ancestors came over on the mayflower so unless you are native american, you belong to this area less than I do&quot;.&nbsp; But, I guess, I just don&#039;t feel quite as ENTITLED as you. I don&#039;t feel like I own this country and have a right to be here more than anyone else. Interesting this has gotten back to people feeling entitled.&nbsp; No one is pushing your kids off the sidewalk.&nbsp; Get over it.<br /><br />Paratactical, I totally agree with you. Why censor your conversation at a bar? You should only have to do that if you feel the ADULTS you are hanging out with might be offended.<br /><br />LizLuv you nailed it right on the head. I was raised like you.&nbsp; It was ok that mom and dad went to a nice restaurant bc we got to go to DQ with the babysitter or watch movies at our friends house. And I am 32 and my brother a few years younger so its not just like you were raised differently bc your parents were a bit older. Its bc they had it together.&nbsp; And you learned right from them! I love what your dad said. Our parents were hippie types that became kinda-yuppies. Labelled or not- they knew about class and where and when to bring their kids.&nbsp; When we got a bit older - my bro was about 8 and we went to a nicer restaurant, we knew how to behave- it was ingrained in us at that point and we were old enough to sit still.

				I wanted to respond to the time that children should be in bed. I&#039;m a new mom, but I&#039;m also a professor. My daughter is on my time schedule, not on what others may consider &quot;normal&quot; waking hours. So we eat dinner after nine, we wake up later, and so the baby is on my schedule. and we take her out likewise. If the baby is crying I leave, but if not, and she is sitting in her little carseat not bothering anyone, I don&#039;t see what the big deal is. I think people like to complain.<br /><br />By the same token, I wouldn&#039;t bring her to an establishement like the beer garden and expect people to watch their language. It is my choice to bring her so i&#039;ll deal. (and I have brought her to the beer garden at two months and she loved it). <br /><br />I guess I wonder, what exactly does everyone expect couples with children to do? Never go out? If i&#039;m not bothering you, don&#039;t bother me.

				There are so many different cultures and age groups that live in the area.&nbsp; With such a variance of people there will inevitably be differences in values.&nbsp; &nbsp;Different groups will act in different ways.&nbsp; To think that one way is right and the other is wrong is very self-centered.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think that the whole sense of entitlement thing is a little hypocritical because asking for people to leave their kids home implies that you are entitled to go out and not see these said children.&nbsp; I have no kids and do not really want to see infants or toddlers crying at bars either, but who am I to tell these people how to raise their kids and where to take them?&nbsp;

				IMO, yes, if you have a kid you shouldn&#039;t be barhopping and bringing your kid along but that&#039;s just my opinion and people will do what people will do regardless. If I was ever at a bar and saw a child there, I would leave and complain to the owner. I don&#039;t think children should be allowed in bars. I think there are adult places and places for children, bars being adult places. I remember I used to wait tables in college at an Irish bar/ restaurant. When the restaurant started filling up with bar patrons and getting loud, we would refuse to sit couples with children outside of the glass enclosed &quot;family section&quot;.<br /><br />I guess it&#039;s just how we were all raised and our respective values. My parents never went out when we were children because they were willing to sacrifice their social lives to raise us in the way they thought proper. They hired a babysitter if they went out and took us out early and to family restaurants. My mother never wanted us to disturb anyone else. I think this is just reflective of how parents are raising kids now and the way in which children are treated like adults more than children now. I remember when I was a kid, we were never allowed to sit on the subway because the adults needed to sit more than we did, etc.

				And <em>I&#039;m</em> glad that I live in a time and place where parents <em>don&#039;t</em> have to give up their friends and entire social lives just because they have a baby.&nbsp; Parents make enough sacrifices with their time and money, and they have just as much right to occasionally leave their house or apartment as anyone else - and yes, <em>with</em> the kid - and have a nice meal or a drink.&nbsp; (Nor should they be limited to unappealing chains or &quot;family restaurants&quot; like Applebee&#039;s or the Olive Garden.)&nbsp; I love seeing kids at the Beer Garden or Sparrow on a beautiful weekend afternoon or evening.&nbsp; Sure, there are behavioural and time limits -- I think the parents should take the child outside or leave when a child is clearly tired/disturbed/upset, and I wouldn&#039;t want to see a young child in either place at 1am, when it&#039;s way crowded and most people have had too much to drink, but I don&#039;t think that&#039;s what we&#039;re talking about here.

				Yes, we were all raised a certain way, and that way differed by culture. I was raised the way I am raising my daughter, and my sleep and outing schedule matched my parents so that I could spend time with my father who had late hours. We aren&#039;t talking about barhopping, rather enjoying what AStoria has to offer which is an array of eating establishements, cafes, etc. <br /><br />Astoria is also an area that has many cultures spanning the country and world, which is great. I think it is amusing that an area that has been settled by many liberal minded individuals can be so restrictive when it comes to children in public places. <br /><br />I can&#039;t wait to explore Astoria with my daughter as now and as she grows. While we won&#039;t be showing up at McCanns at 2am, please plan on seeing us in various cafes and restaurants. I might even (gasp) feed her in public. Can&#039;t imagine the uproar that would cause.

				To me this is more about respecting your fellow neighbors and being a responsible parent. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s responsible having children around people playing drinking games, smoking, and loaded as many people are at the Beer Garden very early. I saw someone throw up one table away from a baby in a stroller last weekend. It&#039;s up to you as a parent but I do think it shouldn&#039;t be allowed to bring infants and toddlers there after a certain hour. That&#039;s just my opinion.

For example, when I was a child in the late 60&#039;s- early 70&#039;s, ( child=ages 4-8) my parents would take us out for dinner, usually at a more expensive restaurant, since my parents could afford it, and it would be all 4 children together usually. And I&#039;m talking dinner at 8 pm, not supper like the English do at 4pm. I can&#039;t speak about bars since my parents didn&#039;t go to bars. Personally, I find nothing offensive in going to have a meal at a restaurant at 10 pm and seeing a child/infant there. As long as the noise level is at a minimum, and s/he behaves like I did at that age, then nothing wrong there. And the same goes for bars. If I had kids I wouldn&#039;t do it myself, but since I don&#039;t have kids, who am I to judge? As the great biblical sage Hillel said: &quot; Do not judge your fellow man, until you have walked in his shoes.&quot;

				I was born in Astoria, I grew up in many of the places which people on this bulletin board have claimed as their own.&nbsp; There were ALWAYS kids everywhere, so the issue is not weird for me.<br /><br />For example, the Beer Garden was a very familiar place for us as kids, and we often played pick-up wiffleball and soccer games while our parents enjoyed the Spaaten, Czech Bud, or the soccer games on the televisions all over the place.&nbsp; While my parents had coffee and desserts at Omonia Cafe, I ran around many of the cafes which are still around.&nbsp; We learned to show of our cuteness as kids to score free tiramisu pieces as well as tiny bakalava.&nbsp; Gilbey&#039;s used to be called Gibney&#039;s, and before it was a happening place, it was an old man&#039;s bar.&nbsp; My grandfather used to take me there, and, lo and behold, there were kids there to play with too.<br /><br />There were many things which I learned from these outings - always tip the waiter well, always offer to buy the first round, as well as learning how to play with other children who I first met.&nbsp; I owe my parents and grandparents a great debt as these outings helped me to develop my social skills, and has made me the person who I am.&nbsp; This is the way that I will raise my daughter.<br /><br />If this offends any of you, it would be good for you to leave the establishments which, for decades has welcomed children.&nbsp; Please send a strong message to these establishments, and go somewhere else.&nbsp; There are many other places that have no-children policies - I know that if you search hard enough, you can find these places in Manhattan.&nbsp; Please, do us all a favor, hop on the N (or R) train and go there.

				I&#039;m beyond shocked how many people here find it ok to take children to bars. A sports game is not a bar and no I wouldn&#039;t bring an infant to a baseball game either. How pissed would you be if you couldn&#039;t watch the game because a two month old was crying behind you? And isn&#039;t the law 18 to enter 21 to drink? What happened to that?

				I am a mom of 2 and I would never, ever take the little ones out at 9PM and have them sit in a bar/restaurant type situation. They would be so cranked out they wouldn&#039;t let us enjoy anything at all. Most of our outings are in the AM. We keep it low rent too-bagel shop, diner, pizzeria. I might occasionally take them for a summer evening stroll around the neighborhood, but we don&#039;t stop anywhere. We also try to avoid commercially busy areas after 5PM, because people are in such a rush and I&#039;m just not used to that anymore and hate that feeling of &quot;being in the way&quot;. But, still, believe it or not, there are those nasty Astorians who pretty much wish me, my kids and my stroller would drop off the face of the earth and are apt to tell me so. It tends to be older people... I try hard to stay out of their way and keep my kids under control but its never enough for some people. I mean, we can&#039;t stay cooped up in the house all day. Kids have to get out and interact in society in order to learn how it all works. I think some of these people that take their kids out to bars and inappropriate places in the evening are probably desperate for some socialization, at the expense of their children&#039;s safety and happiness (and everyone else&#039;s as well). In a way, I kind of feel bad for them.

				I thought this was about a baby two Friday&#039;s ago at Vine &amp; Crescent and I was ready to defend him (though, he&#039;s not my child)<br /><br />I have to say, I was one of those <em>can-you-please-take-your-baby-stroller-out-of-my-rush-hour-commute?</em> people, so when I saw this stroller come into a bar I was pretty irritated... why should I put up with somebody else&#039;s baby?!&nbsp; constant screaming was their choice, not mine!&nbsp; can one just get drunk in peace?!<br /><br />Man, that baby showed me!&nbsp; He was SO freaking entertaining!&nbsp; He was playing peekaboo with the people outside and laughing his heart out.&nbsp; It was really funny.&nbsp; By the time his mom decided to go, my husband and I were like &#039;oh it&#039;s only 10PM! He can surely stay out a bit more!&#039;<br /><br />Since then I&#039;ve revised my attitude towards kids in &quot;grownup&quot; places. I now think that as long as they provide free entertainment and don&#039;t scream, they are welcome to stay. <br /><br />Strollers at rush hour still annoy the hell out of me (people, if you don&#039;t have to be in the street/train at that time, why choose to?), but I try not to give the evil eye anymore.

				How did this issue become exclusively Astoria-centric? As the title of the thread suggests, it&#039;s a hot topic that affects most places around the city and probably the country.<br /><br />I can understand the &quot;when I was growing up in the 60s and 70s, my parents did/didn&#039;t blah blah blah&quot; angle. I don&#039;t understand though why location should matter i.e., &quot;when I was growing up in Astoria in the 60s and 70s, my parents did/didn&#039;t blah blah blah.&quot; <br /><br />Because if you ventured over to Sunnyside or Woodside in the 60s and 70s, neighborhoods where the population was distinctly less of southern European descent, you&#039;d find that it was quite common to come across children in bars.

I mean, do parents not worry about what other people in the bar might do? How drunk or loud or vulgar they might get? I&#039;m amazed that you *want* to put your kid in those places late at night.

				I guess, Alexa, that part of the problem is that a lot of Astoria places aren&#039;t just a bar or just a restaurant. Crescent and Vine is a semi-regular hang out of mine. While I&#039;m not going to puke on the table or get really rowdy, I do swear loudly and tell inappropriate jokes.<br /><br />A restaurant is, IMO, a fine place for kids to be. Provided that strollers aren&#039;t blocking aisles for other customers and the kid isn&#039;t crying, I can always ask for a table a bit away from the parents if I&#039;m worried about the kid. The problem is the borderline places like C&amp;V or restuarants that become more of a bar as the night gets later.<br /><br />I also think the time matters more to the adults than the kids.<br /><br />I&#039;ve seen kids in the Irish Rover in the late afternoons and early evenings. I&#039;m okay with that and the kids in the Beer Garden in the afternoons. I just think that as it gets later, I have a tendency to get rowdier and (obviously) drunker and it makes me feel uncomfortable to think that I would say or do something in front of a kid I shouldn&#039;t.<br /><br />This is my problem that I feel this way, but I doubt I&#039;m the only one. I think most parents on this board seem to have an idea of the difference between when is okay and when starts to get ackward. I think that if people pay attention and try to be considerate of the others around them, there isn&#039;t a problem at all. The real bugger is when people get too caught up in thinking about what they want and don&#039;t try to consider others as well.

Do you think they really want anyone else&#039;s kids around? Or how about a date, boy would that be romantic.<br /><br />IMO it is all about the context. I went to to Telly&#039;s (Taverna) last summer on a&nbsp; Sunday maybe 6:00 for an early(ish) dinner. There were tons of families in there and no complaints from me, perfectly reasonable. I do think, however, that if I wander into say Indigo at 10pm on a Friday night and there are kids in there I&#039;d be pretty peeved. I&#039;ll admit that the line between bars/restaurants/lounges etc. becomes more and more fuzzy and Astoria could easily be classified as a family neighborhood but my experience has been that most of the &quot;offenders&quot; aren&#039;t established families that have been living here for ages but newcomers.

Granted a baby doesn&#039;t get what f___&quot; means, but children hearing it might be considered inappropriate. I make a point when i&#039;m out with adult friends and my kid that they do NOT need to change their behavior on my account. If it isk a smoking area, I move her, if she is cranky, I move her, etc. <br /><br />I do hear what people are saying when that isn&#039;t the case. Two weeks ago I was at Flo with my daughter, and a family of 8 came and sat by us. It was a beautiful Sunday afternoon and within ten minutes, these kids had taken over the restaurant and making it very difficult for patrons to enjoy themselves. This is not the kind of behavior I am advocating. This was very irritating and prevented me from enjoying my day as well. <br /><br />I take great pains at restaurants and cafes not to inconvenience anyone around me becuase I have a baby with me. I would hope that others don&#039;t purposefully try to make me enjoying a frappe more difficult soley because i have a baby with me. <br /><br />Responding to the sacrifice...sure you have to make sacrifices, but is going to a restaurant one of them? Why make an unnecessary sacrifice...I sacrifice sleep, money, sleep, money and sleep (did I mention sleep)...let me have my cake and I choose to have it at a nice cafe in astoria that serves wine.

It&#039;s little stuff like where a stroller is placed that make it seem like parents aren&#039;t paying attention to other customers. I think most parents are careful and attentive about these things and, as a consequence, I probably don&#039;t even notice them and their kids!

				Not to beat it up too much, for its good that we seem to be coming to a bit of an understanding on this issue, but I just wanted to add that yesterday I drank a pitcher of beer at the Beer Garden, smoked, peppered my Cuban friend with ethnic slurs all while playing Scopa and Scoppone (Italian card games, trick type games) and stared luridly at the fairer sex (bless the lovely girls of Astoria!&nbsp; :smitten:) all with a baby a few feet away.&nbsp; I did make a concious effort to keep my cigarette smoke away from the baby, but I also made the same effort to the other non-smokers around me.&nbsp;

				Well, I have to say that I wouldn&#039;t be able to do any of those things if a baby were around. I won&#039;t smoke, curse, or drink in front of children so I find it pretty uncomfortable to see children around if I&#039;m doing any of those things. If a baby sat down next to me at the Beer Garden, I would have to get up and move and potentially lose a table depending on how crowded it was. This has actually happened twice. Just sayin&#039;, not everyone has that level of comfort around children. I would feel like a very dirty bird acting as I would normally act when out carousing around a baby or a child. My friends and I can get pretty raunchy.

				I was at the beer garden yesterday with my daughter...it was a beautiful day and there were other kids there as well...and no one threw up all over the baby. There was another guy walking around with his baby in a baby holder too. <br /><br />I guess I&#039;m sorry people don&#039;t feel comfortable around the baby and can&#039;t be themselves. I guess all I can say is move if you aren&#039;t comfortable. If someone is smoking near me (and Im not smoking) I don&#039;t like breathing it in and i&#039;ll move as well. <br /><br />Toward the later evening, the beer garden did get a little smokier and that is when I left.

I also agree with eblack. Parents who aren&#039;t sensitive to both their child&#039;s needs and the environment around them are the problem. Even in the infamous Park Slope, in the equally infamous Union Hall (the one that finally got fed up and banned strollers) it wasn&#039;t sleeping infants I noticed. It was the crying child at 10 PM in the middle of a quiet part of a performance. And the toddler running onto the bocce court. I once went out with friends to an R-rated movie and they brought along their month-old baby. We sat in the back of the theater and if she woke up, my friend just popped her under the poncho to nurse. I admit to being skeptical of the idea at first (a baby watching the Bourne Identity?) but my friend knew what her baby could handle. Their 3-year-old though, went off with Grandma &amp; Grandpa.<br />

Obviously they&#039;re going to hear swears eventually, but I tend to feel uncomfortable swearing around a kid because I don&#039;t know if their parents are trying to keep them away from bad language.

				Paratactical, I think you are one of the only people that is making much sense at this point. <br />Alexa-I think if people who are adults (who are the ones who belong in a bar) are having their rights&#039; affected if they to alter their behavior because they don&#039;t feel comfortable (as several posters have mentioned).&nbsp; <br />I don&#039;t think you can compare all these things to having kids. You choose to have kids and bring them into these places.&nbsp; Alot of people would argue being gay is genetic, NOT a choice, you don&#039;t choose to get older, and you don&#039;t choose to be disabled.<br />Sorry if I believe kids SHOULD have a bedtime. If they wake up crying at 1 am that&#039;s one thing, but to have them up because you assume they will be up anyway is just ridiculous.&nbsp; I was a terrible sleeper as an infant and my mom couldn&#039;t get me to sleep. My grandmother stepped in and put me on a &quot;schedule&quot;.&nbsp; Finally, I slept.&nbsp; You dont&#039; have to be some type-a neurotic freak but a sleeping schedule does the baby and the parents good. Then the parents can have some ALONE time. To go to bars and be adults. It&#039;s ok. You can do both. S-E-P-A-R-A-T-E-L-Y.&nbsp; I have alot of married friends with kids who completely understand what I am talking about and agree with it.&nbsp; And no, they aren&#039;t conservative, uptight a$$holes. They are people who value family time, couple time, and <em>respect other people&#039;s time.</em>&nbsp; Most have careers too and still manage to not do the &quot;I feel guilty for working so have to tote my kid everywhere&quot;.<br />I don&#039;t have a problem with kids at the beer garden with their parents at 3 pm if there are generally families around. As it is a beer garden, it does seem a bit odd but its an outdoor space in the middle of the day.<br />Winegasm 9 pm, not fine. Indigo late night, not fine. <br />I think the difference isn&#039;t that tough to grab?&nbsp;

We actually <em>left</em> yesterday when a couple 30somethings on motorcycles showed up and crowded the tables surrounding us and got all loud while pointing passed my table to their bikes, or to the tv, or to people walking by, or when one of them started up a conversation with a girl at a table next to him .... I guess what I&#039;m pointing out, is that it doesn&#039;t matter <em>much</em> how old the loud/obnoxious patrons of an establishment are - if they are loud and obnoxious they ought to leave. The difference, obviously, is that tiny children haven&#039;t much choice in the matter, whereas grown ups do - ooo but maybe the grown ups <em>were</em> the children with no choice at some point in time!!!<br /><br />I&#039;ll stop now. <br />Except, it&#039;s ok to have kids in pubs and the like during afternoon hours. where else are they going to learn pool, cards, darts, backgammon, etc. ?

				I don&#039;t feel like mine is the only opinion, I just feel those of us who are single (or are married with kids and maybe don&#039;t believe having kids out at all hours), are not being taken seriously, whatsoever or being made to &quot;defend&quot; ourselves.<br /><br />I see kids late on the subway, often with people that don&#039;t look quite so well off. Maybe they can&#039;t afford a babysitter and have to have their parents take care of their kids while they work long hours for crap pay.&nbsp; So no, I don&#039;t see them in Astoria bars and restaurants because quite a few don&#039;t live here and even if they do, they probably don&#039;t have the money to spend at the increasingly expensive and trendy bars in Astoria, and they may not view it as their &quot;scene&quot;.

				The whole thing about kids riding the subway late at night with their kids strikes me as funny.&nbsp; I mean, most families in NYC don&#039;t have cars, so what form of transportation should they be taking?&nbsp; What if a parent had to work late and was bringing their child home from the babysitters?&nbsp; Or what if there was a family or friend&#039;s party they were at and they were returning home from it?&nbsp; Where I&#039;m from, families do go with their children to house parties, and if anything, the kids fall asleep in the spare bedroom.&nbsp; At the end of the night, the parents pick the kid up and go home.&nbsp; There are plenty of reasons why people take trains with their kids late at night.&nbsp; I don&#039;t like a crying baby as much as the next person, but this thread&#039;s been real interesting to read how people judge other&#039;s parenting.&nbsp; I also don&#039;t like obnoxious drunks and often think they can be worse than children.&nbsp; If the kid&#039;s not running around and screaming and crying, then it&#039;s really not a big deal to me.&nbsp; But if I paid $12 to watch a movie, and you can&#039;t take a crying child out of the theatre, well, that&#039;s just damn inconsiderate.&nbsp; &nbsp;That I would get a babysitter for.

				When I first read through this thread many of the sentiments expressed struck a chord because when people make complaints about the behavior children I often thought it was unfair to criticize kids being kids when the problem is usually parents not being parents.<br /><br />But few of the postings so far (if any) seem to concern real instances of out-of-control children causing mayhem in public while a parent sits by unconcerned. Many seem only to be bothered by the mere sight of a child out in the evening or the nerve some parents have to actually take a child out in public after the sun goes down.<br /><br />So is it about parents and parenting -- or that children should be not seen and not heard?

				28grand, to answer your question, myself, I am not &quot;mad&quot; at the kids. They are kids, for Gods sakes. The only time I am annoyed by kids is when they are old enough to know better (i.e. 8 years old and swinging their legs on metro north and kicking you, repeatedly). Of course, daddy should do something since he is right there.<br />I think its more parenting (this is just my opinion) than the kids themselves. Crying kids in the movie theatre do annoy me, heck even in nice restaurants but they didnt&#039; bring themselves into these establishments.<br />Kids crying on the subway or plane don&#039;t bother me (well if they are shrieking it might be annoying but so be it), people have to get around and this is NYC how the hell else are they going to get around. In general most kids seem to be well-behaved on the subway. (Frappe this answers what you said as well).&nbsp; <br />The problem I have is with people taking kids into bars and adult restaurants late at night. And I am not an anomaly (as you will see by other posts).&nbsp; I find obnoxious drunk a$$holes as annoying as the next person but going into a bar you kinda have to realize that may be part of the scene- some places more than others. And I think its also about feeling comfortable about swearing, drinking, whatever in front of small children (some people have expressed discomfort at doing so).<br />There are many nice restaurants that have age restrictions (under 16 etc- which is pretty old honestly)- I can&#039;t see why bars won&#039;t do this- or places adults can feel comfortable later on in a kids-free envir.&nbsp; Like no-one under whatever age after 8 pm or whatever. Compromise to satisfy both parties.

				Opa thanks for your post.<br /><br />I agree with you to a certain extent because I do think there are certain bars/restaurants and/or certain times at these places that are unsuitable for children but I also think you can&#039;t compare how things (i.e., raising children) are done today to how they were done in the past because the circumstances are not exactly comparable.<br /><br />I&#039;m just trying to work out what the issue is about for myself because it interests me and I have a feeling something else, which I can&#039;t put my finger on, is in play here.<br />

				28Grand- NP.&nbsp; Thanks for not attacking me. This is a message board and one should be able to express their opinions freely here I believe without getting condescending one-liners.<br />I do feel times have changed but could also be a suburban/city thing.&nbsp; I have alot of friends/family who live in smaller cities or suburbs all over the U.S. and they wouldn&#039;t take their kids into these places, etc.&nbsp; They wouldn&#039;t even really understand it.&nbsp; <br />I do think where city kids have some advantages, they also have alot of disadvantages (which isn&#039;t to criticize people who raise their kids in a city- and&nbsp; I mean people with money who could afford to do either, not poor people), some of the disadvantages being lack of outdoor space- which I didnt really appreciate as a kid but do now.&nbsp; Little things like- alot of people I know who grew up in NYC don&#039;t know how to drive or swim.&nbsp; I also think city kids &quot;grow up&quot; alot faster, which isn&#039;t a good thing. Then again, they have museums, theatre, learn about diff cultures, etc. so I guess its about making choices.<br /><br />Hmmm...very intriguing, if you can put your finger on it and care to, please do share.&nbsp; <br />

				<br />One of the most unique things about this part of the country is that no one is on the same schedule. Most of my friends and family are in the theatre/tv/film industry and this is rarely a 9-6 situation or even a set schedule for that matter. I can remember the years when my husband was working overnights and I was cooking dinner at 3:30 am. And now I consider myself very lucky to eating dinner at 10pm. <br /><br />While I don&#039;t find myself out a lot in Astoria on weeknights, I do see kids in restaurants all over NYC all the time after 9pm. Most of the time these are non-school age kids and I dont think it is odd for them to be on their parents schedule. I was raised this way. I rather like that these kids are getting to spend time with their parents (which can be a difficult thing to manuever these days). <br /><br />Responsible parents will always address the needs of their children first anyway in any situation....meaning if they are disruptive, they will address it by removing them from situation or by pacifying them. Those parents that just ignore the child running about and wailing in public are the exception, that&#039;s just irresponsible parenting.<br /><br />I wasnt going to share my opinion because I dont have children and am not easily irritated by anything, but the thread kept popping into my head all week so I thought i&#039;d share.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />

				Just some things I wanted to point out-first, this is NOT an Astoria or NYC exclusive thing. This happens all over the place. If you think its bad here, go out to the NYC burbs. I&#039;ve seen some pretty unbelievable stuff. I also hear from my friends in CA and the South that the same thing goes on there. Don&#039;t know how well-received it is though.<br /><br />Secondly, when I go to Greece, it is not uncommon for little kids to be out with their families well into the evening. Nobody seems to bat an eyelash and when I protested to my family about bringing my young children out to dinner at 10 PM last year, it ended up being a very enjoyable and suprising experience. Nobody seemed to care that all the kids gathered up in a group and were running around playing while we ate. The establishment owners and employees and other patrons engaged the children, played with them, talked to them, etc. It was so different. I figured someone was going to go off on me at any minute for letting my kids ruin their night-and they didn&#039;t. I probably wouldn&#039;t do that here, because it just doesn&#039;t seem &quot;right&quot; here in NY. <br /><br />Thirdly, don&#039;t feel inhibited to curse or refrain from certain behaviors in front of my kids. I can&#039;t speak for everyone else, but I would prefer my children to see these things when they are with me, and ask me questions and let ME explain it to them, as opposed to them learning from another source on their own and perhaps getting a different idea about things. We hear people cursing and yelling, smoking, arguing, etc. in the morning on the street, so what&#039;s the difference? If I think its time to take them out of the situation, I will. Sheltering your kids too much never does any good-I&#039;ve seen too many of my friends go down some pretty terrible paths when they broke out from their parents dictatorship style homes.<br /><br />This is a very interesting thread, and while I am not the type of mom that paratactical has complained about, I think I am going to be even more extra-conscious of my surroundings and try not to annoy our fellow Astorians-if I can.&nbsp; :wink: 8-)

				LOL Hillary as much as I wish you much luck in the real estate market (and it only tends to go up here), that would suck for those of us who aren&#039;t investment bankers.<br /><br />Speaking of which, I think the commute to wall street would be a bit of a trek so that has been holding people off. Plus, Astoria just isn&#039;t as &quot;cultured&quot; and &quot;refined&quot; (i.e. rich) and has mish-mashy architecture. A major turn-off to the brownstone people. I think Astoria still has (gasp!) a semi-ethnic vibe (God forbid!). But they will catch on eventually. <br /><br />When you hear the soon-to-close Park Slope Tea Lounge (which has alot of mommies up in arms) has relocated to 30th Ave, you will know its time to sell, sell, sell!<br />http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/31/21/31_21_tea_lounge_to_close_in.html<br />You should call them and tell them to move in next door&nbsp; :-P<br /><br />I like the park slope mom who blamed gentrification. Ummm.... unless she has been there like 20 years she would be one of the gentrifiers.

				I was at the beer garden again today and saw quite a few young ones there...not bothering anyone. It was really nice, and the beer garden staff really went above and beyond to help my girlfriend with ther 16-month-old find some milk (which they went and got, filled the sippy cup and refused money for it). <br /><br />Unfortunately, my friends 16-month old started crying and she didn&#039;t make a move to leave. I suggested that we leave as I started to feel uncomfortable being near the crying baby, even the it does get a bit loud there and doubt anyone heard. <br /><br />Everyone is different in how they handle their children, much like how they handle their cigarette smoke, their language, off-color humor, etc. In any regard, i think the bottom line is consideration for others.

				Hi, iIm fairly new here, but iIve been following up on your discussion for a few days now. I hope you don&#039;t mind what I have to say. Although I do agree with certain points on both sides of the argument, but as adults, have we not been exposed to many new things of which we&#039;ve all had to adapt? Heck, I remember when women weren&#039;t allowed to sunbathe topless in nyc. Now, there are many areas where they can even if children are in the vicinity. I also remember when the word &quot;bitch and ass&quot; weren&#039;t allowed on television, but now they are even if children are in the vicinity and during waking hours. Dirty and naked girlie mags are exposed on practically every corner when passing your neighborhood candy stand. Our children have less places to go and less things to be exposed to with all of the adults stating they have a right to allow everything they feel is fair to them. Yes, I agree that all children should have an early bedtime, but i don&#039;t believe these parents are taking their children everyday of the week to a bar. And yes, I believe that parents should occasionally hire a sitter for quality adult alone keep my sanity time, but that would mean that the couple of drinks for them have turned into almost a hundred dollar tab if you include the sitters payment. And if you truly think about it, not all bars allow children, so adults still have their adults only locations which are many. And last, given that after three drinks some of your fellow bar drinkers can&#039;t hold their liquor and start behaving more and more like children everyday and that doesn&#039;t stop the rest of us from frequenting those locations, then all should be good. After the childish behavior of most intoxicated adults, the actual children just seem to blend into the background anyway. And yes, I do have kids, and no, I don&#039;t take them to bars when I get an urge to get away for a drink. But just because I don&#039;t, it doesn&#039;t mean that society as a whole should not adapt to this new upcoming trends. We do with&nbsp; mostly everything else. <br /><br />Thanks for listening folks. Hey, that actually felt pretty good.

				I think the bottom line is using good judgment...I have a 3 month old and bring her everywhere...doesn&#039;t mean i have her out every night of the week till 2am. last night we were at avenue cafe until 12am, and she was sleeping in her stroller none the wiser...a screaming baby in a bar isn&#039;t respectful of your neighbors, but i don&#039;t think ANY of the parents posting here are asking anyone to tolerate screaming children, as that would be ridiculous...but complaints of an infant in a bjorn, not crying while dad has a beer with friends, or well-behaved children at a childrens movie are also ridiculous. <br /><br />in terms of that much needed whiskey, is it the parents you are upset with or the bar owners...seems like a complaint should be made to the owner, and if they want to keep their valued adult consumers of spirits, they shouldn&#039;t accept hosting a romper room.

				I&#039;ve been following this topic for awhile and finally decided to chime in.<br /><br />Basically it&#039;s the old &quot;time and place for everything&quot; sensibility.<br /><br />My partner is divorced and he has two small kids - ages 6 &amp; 9. They&#039;re great and we often go out<br />to eat in Astoria. But we take them to places like Last Stop or Igloo over at Ditmars. We wouldn&#039;t think<br />of bringing them to our regular places like Mojave, Brick or even Grand Cafe. They&#039;re well-behaved, but<br />they do act up sometimes and a diner is better for them. <br /><br />I&#039;ve always considered a bar or even the Beer Garden &quot;adults only.&quot; If we go out for a drink, I&#039;m sorry,<br />but we want to relax - not listen to kids carrying on. If we go to a &#039;family&#039; place like Uno&#039;s or Applebees,<br />that&#039;s different. <br /><br /><br />

				Aren&#039;t there enough locations here in Astoria that we can all go to drink where the little ones aren&#039;t allowed? Hey, that&#039;s one of the reasons I moved here. Many options, many places to go. You know what&#039;s funny? I have yet to encounter one of these child friendly bars. I hear about it all the time, I hear people complaining about it, but everytime I go out, no kiddies, not one. I must be visiting the &quot;right&quot; places then. And if anything, whether it was kids or dogs, a rude bartender or roudy intoxicated bar goers made me uncomfortable, hey, easy solution. There&#039;s always another bar next door. You see how easy that was? Now, can&#039;t we all get along? <br /><br />

				LIC Bar is kid and dog friendly, actually. Ever seen the dog(s) in their yard? Plus it is up to the owner. I would imagine that the kids party at LIC Bar wasn&#039;t just a bunch of people who showed up, expecting to have their kids party there, but rather I&#039;m sure it was planned well in advance. You said you went in the evening. To me evening means after 4pm but before 8pm. I see nothing wrong with that happening. You could have complained to the owner, like mcgowan said, instead of coming here to kvetch about it, after the fact.

				In cases like this, i&#039;m sure money talks and other than just planning the party at this bar, i&#039;m sure the parent layed down a pretty penney to reserve the time. Sure, they could have gone to Chuckee Cheese, but even kids hate that place. And, what if the so called parent knew the owner at the bar and he offered up his place to have the b-day there despite what the staff felt. They work for the owner. They get paid by him. A few days out of the 365 days a year is not going to break the bank for the owner or the staff and I&#039;m sure it&#039;s not going to create chaos in the lives of the bar goers. Hey, I think everyone needs a drink just about now.

				I generally don&#039;t mind kids in bars as long as they are well behaved same goes with restaurants.<br /><br />However I do not understand the concept of a kid&#039;s party in a bar. How is that fun for a kid sitting in a place where you can&#039;t run around, yell, and be crazy?? It might be fun for the parents- but I can&#039;t imagine its too fun for the kids.<br /><br />Slight OT -Another pet peeve of mine- why do kids always have to have a special party at a themed place like a bar, Mikey D&#039;s, Chuckee Cheese etc. Its like everyone is trying to out do one another with these parties.&nbsp; What ever happened to a party in your backyard, apartment or a park with some friggin cupcakes and goofy hats? Sorry end of rant.

It was a press event, co-sponsored by the Chocolate Bar (that chichi line of chocolate makers).&nbsp; It STARTED at 10PM.&nbsp; But NOOOOOOOOOO, because the word &quot;chocolate&quot; was in there, some moron thought it was a great idea to take their squirmy 2-year-old with them.&nbsp; The kid spent the whole night running under people&#039;s chairs and stools, getting into people&#039;s bags, the press kits, etc.&nbsp; She even ran into a few tables, spilling over drinks.&nbsp; Of course, the parents glared at the angry patrons like they were the ones with the problem for daring to consume alcohol in front of their little angel or something.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />

				A bit late on reading through all this, but I don&#039;t get all the debate here.<br />Bringing a child to a bar is just terrible parenting. Bottom line. <br />It&#039;s part of what you signed up for when you had kids. Was my old man able to take me to bars when I was a child, hell no! He sat at home and drank his scotch and watched the ball game and yelled at the TV in his house because he had a child and a responsibility. Sorry to all those parents that it is so inconvenient to have a child, but leave your child at child-appropriate venues. If that isn&#039;t what you want to do, then why did you have a kid? My parents got a babysitter once every week or other week and had their alone time, and the rest of the time was kid-appropriate places. <br />A bar is not a place for a kid. A nice quiet restaurant is not a place for a kid. An iron working factory is not a place for a kid. A strip club is not a place for a kid. It&#039;s all common sense.

Now, if for some reason the parent(s) demand &quot;child-appropriate&quot; behavior at an adult place, well, that&#039;s absurd. &nbsp;I have never encountered that situation, though.

				I&#039;ve never taken my son to a bar, but I have taken him to my office, where there is much cursing and I never make others supress their behavior just because they are present. As a good parent, I remind my son that it doesn&#039;t matter what others do or how they behave around him, he just needs to learn his own limits under my care. We can&#039;t shield our children. You&#039;re right when stating that we wouldn&#039;t take our children to a strip club, but like i mentioned before, television is bombarded by barely dressed women as well as magazines in candy stores which children do frequent. <br />If some are concerned with having to deal with screaming &quot;rugrats&quot; at a bar while they are trying to relax and have a drink after work, well, then you are in the wrong venue to relax even if children are not present. After a few drinks, most people are disorderly and behave like children themselves. They knock things down just as much as a little 2 year old.<br />Let&#039;s not worry about the establishments that have allowed the occassional parent/child scenaro. Just have a drink. Hey, maybe after three drinks you won&#039;t even notice the kids are there anyway.

				Judge much? You&#039;re the one judging the parents themselves!! And while I don&#039;t have kids and I do love kids ( as long as they&#039;re well adjusted and well behaved, I see nothing wrong with a kid being out with his/her parents.

				Excuse me, but bringing a child to a bar is not necessarily bad parenting. It DEPENDS ON THE ESTABLISHMENT...holy s___...what is the big f-n deal with having&nbsp; a quiet kid in a stroller not bothering anyone...it is how the child is handled at these establishments that speaks to the parenting. so let&#039;s all take it easy. NO one wants screaming kids at a bar or restaurant, or ANYWHERE for that matter. Hell, I don&#039;t like being at Astoria park having a picnic listening to kids screaming and crying...that is just as annoying as having them cry in a restaurant...move with your kid or get your kid under control...just becuase it is a park do3es not mean it is free opportunity to trample on other peoples stuff, tantrum and scream. <br /><br />In astoria, good luck clarifying bar...but all this bitching about parents bringing kids to bars as if they are doing shots on the bar while they are screaming and shitting all over the place is going to far...and everyone getting angry about babies is a bit out of control as well. This is a kid-friendly neighborhood, get over it. And if you aren&#039;t going to site the two times (out of how many hundreds) you walk into a bar and find children there and belabor the point, it is a misrepresentation of data. It makes it sound like there are balloons and parties everywhere. I&#039;ve been going to gibneys for 7 yeasrs and have yet to see anyone under ...well...lets say 16? there. <br /><br />I&#039;m a good parent, and I&#039;m also a respectful adult with friends that I meet out. Lets cut the s___ with the judgement on parenting, what everyone things an agreed upon appropriate &#039;bedtime&#039; is, and what constitutes an adult establishment. Differnt work schedules warrant various lifestyles for different families and how closed-minded of some people to judge that. If someone told me that children weren&#039;t permitted at an establishment, I get it..but that has yet to happen, and it isn&#039;t my fault. <br /><br />I&quot;m not quite sure why the sight of children makes some people so angry...you are aware that children are a necessary part of the propagation of the species right?<br /><br />

				I also want to clarify, I am not trying to tell anyone how to raise their kids. I am merely stating my opinion that I think it is bad parenting to bring a kid into a bar, and I would never do it. There are far worse offenses, and too many terrible parents in this world that actually put their kids in direct harm, so this really does pale in comparison. <br />As a bar patron, if I went to a bar and saw that they were letting kids in, I would stop going there. I guess it really is at the discretion of the bar owner. There is a certain atmosphere I think most bar patrons go to a drinking establishment for, and I think for most people, that includes no children.

				Actually, my main concern is that a bar is not a place for a child. And I think it is irresponsible to have drunk people around kids- home, bar, concert, wherever. Drunk folks are notorious for reckless behavior and bad decision making. And no, you should not kick your kids out if you decide to drink in the house, but if you and your buddies are regularly getting drunk around your kids, I think most people would agree that is not a good thing for your child, and an invitation for problems. <br />It&#039;s all, of course, relative to the circumstances. If you are sitting at a Sunday brunch in Sparrow with your kid, it&#039;s not the same as going to Saturday night beer garden at 1AM. If you are getting a bit tipsy on Super Bowl Sunday it&#039;s not the same as getting wrecked with your buddies on a school night while not paying attention to your kid. <br /><br />Secondary to the child&#039;s safety and well being is my inconvenience. Like I said, I wouldn&#039;t call the cops about it, I just wouldn&#039;t patronize the bar any more. <br />

				Now you&#039;ve made a qualified statement that is much different than your earlier blanket statement of &quot;it is, in my opinion, an act of bad parenting to bring a child into a bar.&quot;&nbsp; The statement that you made in this post, I completely agree with.&nbsp; <br /><br />On a side note, I happened to have lunch with my wife, mother-in-law and son today.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t my choice, but we had lunch in a pub.&nbsp; The waitress and bartender loved him.&nbsp; The pub was also mostly empty, but the patrons who were there didn&#039;t seem to care less if there was a baby in the bar.&nbsp; I was tempted to take a poll.<br /><br />

				I smoke, so yes of course I&#039;d rather have smoking in bars. My opinion on it in brief is: it&#039;s not a health spa, it&#039;s a bar. I would have been more than happy having a few bars left to smoke in and a lot that you couldn&#039;t smoke in to give everybody an option. Hey, if it&#039;s smoky and you don&#039;t like it, go to one of the others you can&#039;t smoke in. Something akin to a licensing system for bars to see if you can smoke or a lottery system. And yes, cigarettes belong in bars more than babies but it&#039;s just my opinion and you know how that goes, everyone&#039;s got one. I miss the days of NYC being a place that wasn&#039;t so damn sensitive and PC.

You used to have to have a thick skin.

				Man, I have been loving this thread. What I especially like is seeing myself pre-kid vs post kid.<br />First, let me say, getting parenting tips from non-parents is about as useful as getting financial advice from the destitute. They may mean well but they haven&#039;t a clue about parenting until they experience it.<br />So how about a little leeway for us parents, who live 24/7 with every decision that we make. <br />I have no problem taking my son to a bar before 8:00PM as long as there is seating away from the bar.

				Alexa, I wouldn&#039;t take the neg nods to heart. It is just people who are expressing their &quot;opinions&quot; in absentia. And why does it surprise you considering that lean that this thread has taken at times? I have no kids, yet I see no problem if a parent either can&#039;t afford to get a baby sitter or just feels that it is his/her right to be able to go to a bar to have a drink and be able to shlep said baby along for the ride.Also, why do you have to defend your actions against people who obviously are anti-baby.

Very creative.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think anyone is anti-baby, and I completely understand not wanting to have crying babies and rambunctious toddlers around you...i don&#039;t want that either., What I DON&#039;T understand is not tolerating children that have no impact on you what-so-ever except tyhat they might be in the same room or breathing the same air...and that there appears to be anger about this displayed under the guise of concern for the children&#039;s own well-being.

				Okay, here&#039;s my deal. I love dogs and I love most kids. I like to see dogs where I like to see kids: before I&#039;m too shiatfaced to do anything wrong.

That&#039;s a little intolerant, don&#039;t you think? Adult only spaces are usually well defined beforehand. <br />&nbsp; Actually when I was a kid (i.e; 8) my parents took me out for my birthday to a pretty expensive restaurant. Now, I didn&#039;t have a tantrum of any sort because they didn&#039;t have the chocolate fudge melt that they had promised and I don&#039;t seem to recall, 34 years later, any of the other patrons at the restaurant saying anything to the manager about it. In fact I wasn&#039;t the only kid there. And I have eaten at expensive restaurants and seen kids with their parents, it is a natural occurrence, but most kids that dine at a restaurant with their parents are expected to behave like adults. At least that&#039;s what my parents told me before we entered that restaurant; &quot;now zisse yingele ( it&#039;s yiddish for sweet child) please behave like an adult or we will have to leave before dessert&quot; ( they loved to bribe me).

				From what I have read, I think that I am with Alexa on this one.<br /><br />&nbsp;My parents are both professional performers/musicians/educators so they had a schedule that changed often. When we were young, they tried to have us with them as much as possible. Both to spend time with us, of course, but also to expose us to as many people and situations as possible. This sometimes included later evenings, music festivals, bars, green rooms of theaters. Esp in the summer when we were not in school. My cousins were raised the same way. It just works best for some families. No one ended up in jail or with substance abuse problems, etc. <br /><br />There may be things that some may think not appropriate for kids to be around but I think it is just a parenting choice. My parents explained everything we saw and asked about to us.&nbsp; I think we are all just influenced by the way we saw it done.<br /><br />I know that in many states it is illegal to bring children in bars. Could it be that maybe some of the posters that are very &quot;anti kids in bars&quot; are used to this precedent? <br /><br />It is funny that this has been in my mind so often... I find myself noting all of the children I see out after 10pm. BTW I have seen it OFTEN in both the East and West village in the past couple of weeks (it is summer). And there were many toddlers-teens at the Phil Lesh show at Jones Beach last night. I always see ages &quot;baby thru 80&quot; at those shows and I think it would be very odd if there weren&#039;t kids there. They weren&#039;t up against speakers where it was too loud...but they were in the back dancing with their parents and everyone else. <br /><br />Just 2 cents from someone that spent a great deal of their childhood outside the house.

That&#039;s whack. <br /><br />I think the idea that &quot;adults&quot; have to act &quot;adult&quot; all the time is annoying and boring. Swearing, carousing and drinking don&#039;t have to be inconsiderate or obnoxious things, but too often people are out looking to get annoyed. I party. I dance. I will loudly sing the wrong words to songs or try to get the bartenders to let me dance on the bar. It&#039;s called fun. It&#039;s not meant to be obnoxious and if the entire bar were of a more demure mode, I wouldn&#039;t do it--that would be inconsiderate and obnoxious--but there&#039;s a whole heckuva lot I do that I don&#039;t like doing in front of kids.<br /><br />I also, though, got my compunction to act a certain way around children from years of being a summer camp counselor in high school. I was by no means behaving myself, but that didn&#039;t mean that I wasn&#039;t still charged with acting and promoting responsibility in the kids I was watching.

The poor baby was either hungry or wet, or just needed some holding and was crying and choking for a full 5 minutes, when I offered to pick her up and hold her so that her parents could finish their meal. I guess they got the hint and thanked me and picked her up and the baby instantly stopped crying. The owner of the restaurant sent my table a round of drinks with a thank you note, and comped our dessert.

				I am in Greece right now. As soon as we went out I thought of this board and this post in particular, and felt compelled to come and post. We have a house in a suburb outside of Athens that is a huge tourist spot, lots of bars, clubs, cafes and restaurants that kind of crossover between those functions depending on the time of day. Well, we&#039;ve been out at 10PM, 11PM, midnight and there are tons of small kids (and babies) being pushed around in strollers, hanging out at the establishments, etc. The people smoke, drink and cuss with the best of them. Even the playgrounds here are alive at midnight with lots of active kids. Nobody cares, in fact it seems to be very normal for this time of year. In fact, we just got back from an evening in the town with the kids at around 2 AM. What makes it OK here and not in our neck of the woods? Just curious as to why the mentalities are so different? Maybe everyone here is more laid back because of the afternoon nap they take...the afternoon heat....don&#039;t know.

				It may very well be cultural...I&#039;m greek, and when in greece, strollers out at all hours is completely a way of life...we have festivals where children are running aroudn playing, and exactly as greeneyed said, the playground is in full swing, kids are everywhere. <br /><br />I wonder if it isn&#039;t so much what the OP considered entitiled yuppies, as much as cultural variation, which is essentially &#039;Astoria&#039;, or at least what i like about astoria.<br /><br />However, the situation that NYCMacuser encountered might be the type of thing that some of the people of this board don&#039;t like&#039; the crying baby. I just got in now with my daughter from being out at Avenue cafe, (yes, and it is after 12) which is mostly (from what I can tell) predominantly frequented by greeks, and no one batted an eye that the baby was with me. But I will say, it is MUCH easier to take a three month old out than it is a toddler or more so...it again, depends on the kid and the parent.

I don&#039;t believe a baby should have to cry more than 30 seconds to get my attention. I believe that if you don&#039;t give a crying baby all the attention they need when they are that young, the grow up with the feeling that their needs are not important to you. I offered to hold the baby just to ease whatever discomfort she was feeling and hoped that that offer would make her parents want to do the same.

If it really bothers people to see babies at restaurants and family minded bar type places then take it up with the establishment, they are the ones who set the rules.&nbsp; They are the ones who allow babies and kids in.<br />3. People need to be a bit more tolerant of their neighbors and their situations. Not everyone is single or with kids or out for a quiet date or out for a drunkfest.

				Hey I am not greek and I live here too... my point is its not the greeks - its spoiled entitled people...and yes alot are transplants (you get alot in NY!)&nbsp; And I have alot of friends who are non-white and live in &quot;rougher&quot; sections of BK that are being gentrified. They are kind of bitter...which one can understand because they don&#039;t want to be priced out. On the other hand, asking $1200 for a 2bdrm apt in East NY just to try to import white people and put money in the pockets of slumlords is just laughable to me- so there are many crappy forces at work.<br /><br />&nbsp;No one wants the city to be crime-ridden but being prohibitively expensive is another thing as well. That only works if you make a fortune or mommy and daddy pay your rent (which also drives up rent for those of us living in the real world since we don&#039;t usually make as much as people&#039;s parents).&nbsp; There is virtually no middle-class here, whatsoever.<br /><br />I realize I am veering off-topic but I am helping a fellow Astorian apt hunt and the prices (and brokers) are frankly, offensive (but thats a post for another day).&nbsp; Time to get back to being labelled anti-child&nbsp; :-P<br />

				Thanks for letting me know. No seriously, at least you aren&#039;t passive aggressive re: the nods&nbsp; &nbsp;:roll:<br /><br />However, I did note i was veering slightly OT (the topic I happened to establish, by the way) so you could be a little less nasty there.<br /><br />My claims aren&#039;t based on &quot;nothing&quot; esp since I know a few people who sadly bring the kids to inappropriate places. One in particular, the kid has no bedtime, no schedule, inconsistent discipline and now is completely acting out in school. Supposedly other kids are just too loud for him. Shocker, there.<br /><br />I agree that Astoria might not be a first choice but sometimes these people are placed out of P.S. and Manhattan.&nbsp; Astoria might not have the coolness/snobiness of Manhattan or Stroller Brigades and beauty of P.S., but at least they can brag to their friends about the ethnic restaurants and not have to move to.... Westchester or Long Island.&nbsp; How LAME would that be?&nbsp; No sushi joint or hip coffee shop right down the street. HORRORS! How would their 4 year old and 7 year old survive with no java or california rolls?<br /><br />Apparently some people disagree with Astoria not attracting yuppies:<br />http://queens.about.com/cs/neighborhoods/a/neighborhoods.htm<br />http://newyork.citysearch.com/feature/37416/eating.html<br />http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/22/realestate/22livi.html?n=Top/Classifieds/Real%20Estate/Locations/New%20York/New%20York%20City/Queens<br /><br />Maybe they are ALL wrong?!<br /><br />The below- I don&#039;t even have to comment.

				I don&#039;t think his mom not letting him play with kids till he was 3 (including his own cousins) helped. She said they were too loud and scared him. That he didnt like other kids. She is a bit...uptight.&nbsp; Poor kid.&nbsp; he had no discipline but at the same time is completely sheltered in some respects. Its kinda hard to explain....<br /><br />But yes another post, another day.....

				It has to do with a general attitude towards pregnant women or families with small children.&#160; Sorry, we&#039;re citizens and people too, and we&#039;re going to participate in society and patronise local business just as much as those without kids.&#160; I&#039;ve never been to an Applebees or an Olive Garden in my life, and I&#039;m not about to start now, either.&#160; This doesn&#039;t mean we&#039;re going to be inconsiderate of those around us, though, and even though none of this was directed at me, I sure resent and reject the assumption and implication that I won&#039;t be considerate of others.&#160; From PP&#039;s post, it was pretty clear that he was asking a question because he <em>was</em> being considerate of others.&#160; To take your response in that direction was uncalled for.<br /><br />Besides, since when is Koliba or Zlata Praha an expensive splurge?&#160; We&#039;re not talking Per Se, Babbo, or even 718 here.

				There&#039;s no reason to drag Christine over the coals for her comment. <br /><br />I can completely understand Christine&#039;s general reaction to hearing about kids in public places. I share it.<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry if people are antagonistic about parents bringing their screaming/crying children to public places, but that&#039;s because a lot of parents _suck_ at doing something about it when their child starts wigging out. PP and Lanseaux sound like they&#039;re responsible and our comments are not aimed at them.<br /><br />Some parents are good and immediately take their crying child outside to calm them down. In those situations I feel bad for the parent (particularly if it&#039;s a movie). And I appreciate that they&#039;re proactive the moment the child starts acting out and potentially (more than likely) ruining the movie or dining experience of the other patrons. Also, I understand that sitters are expensive and/or hard to find. With a sitter a $25 movie for a couple suddendly costs $60+ for two new parents.<br /><br /><br /><br />But most of the time the parents just sit there and let the child scream and cry and the parents ignore it. <br /><br />I have sat through an hour and forty minute movie where a child started crying ten minutes after the movie started. And proceeded to cry for over thirty minutes. And the parents just sat there. Until some of the people in the back starting yelling at the parents and then the PARENTS started throwing a fit about their right to be there and yelling back and making threats to the people in the back until even more people (just about everyone in the movie theater) chimed in and FINALLY the father ended up taking the baby out of the movie theater to calm it down (or more likely change its diaper since they came back 15 minutes later and the baby didn&#039;t cry through the rest of the movie).<br /><br />This is just _ONE_ _RECENT_ example of why I personally cringe whenever I see babies and very small children in public places. Or hear the first ear piercing baby&#039;s cry. <br /><br />Don&#039;t blame US for OUR negative reaction to parents with young children/babies.<br /><br />Blame all the BAD PARENTS who have conditioned US to react this way. <br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />********<br /><br />Also, I really don&#039;t appreciate your offhand derogatory comments about what an expensive splurge is. Maybe it&#039;s just not an expensive splurge to YOU. Does the enjoyment of people with a lower income than yours somehow count less? Apparently you think so.<br /><br />********<br />Personally, I have not seen a large negative general attitude towards pregnant women. <br /><br />Sure, some people will not give up their seat for an obviously pregnant woman. But for every one or even two of those, there&#039;s usually one who will. I myself have given up my seat many times for pregnant women, old people and handicapped people. <br /><br />Also, sometimes it&#039;s just plain hard to tell if a woman is pregnant or is fat. Sometimes it&#039;s obvious, but other times.....................most people don&#039;t want to risk offending. <br /><br />Yes, I&#039;m sure I&#039;ve seen pregnant women who I didn&#039;t know were pregnant not offered a seat. And I&#039;m sure they silently fumed and went home and wrote on their blogs about how they weren&#039;t offered a seat on the subway that morning. <br /><br />I have <strong>never </strong> seen an <strong>obviously </strong> pregnant woman not be offered a seat on the subway <strong>or </strong> a pregnant woman asking a train car if anyone would let them have their seat and be refused by the entire train car.

				<em>Don&#039;t blame US for OUR negative reaction to parents with young children/babies.<br />Blame all the BAD PARENTS who have conditioned US to react this way.</em> <br /><br />THANK YOU. My comment was indeed meant as a general sentiment and NOT directed at fellow Astorians (those on this board) who tend to be more considerate and thoughtful than those who don&#039;t even bother to ask.<br /><br />Whenever I encounter a screaming baby in public, I often wonder what I would do in the parents&#039; situation. Most likely, drop what I&#039;m doing, and take the kid outside for timeout. Easier said than done- I was a nanny and a babysitter for many years so I know that much!<br /><br />I brought it up lest other (less-considerate) parents get the idea that <em>everybody</em> is okay with it. Also, because I had experienced two random acts of complete thoughtlessness within a short amount of time while out shopping the day before, and was in speak-up mode (might post about that separately.)<br /><br />The place we went was not anyplace mentioned recently- I had been waiting for a couple years to try it! Around $80 for one appetizer, two entrees, one dessert. Not even drinks. <br /><br />

Sorry, I have no interest in your child. I don&#039;t want to see the pictures or hear children crying when I&#039;m trying to unwind after a day of demanding work. I know you love your children and that in your eyes, they are wonderful and special, but they aren&#039;t mine and I shouldn&#039;t have to deal with them when I&#039;m having a good evening. That doesn&#039;t mean that I&#039;m going to be completely inconsiderate about it. I&#039;m not going to give you dirty looks just for having the kids around, nor am I going to be upset no matter how they act. I&#039;ll be more than happy to sit next to a well-behave child in a restaurant and I&#039;ll appreciate it. Even though none of this was directed at me, I resent the idea that wanting to dine without your children nearby somehow implies that I have an implicit disgust toward pregnant women or families with small children. To take your response in the direction that this is some kind of terrible societal &quot;anti-pregnant women or families with small children&quot; bias is extreme.<br /><br />Besides, when does the cost of a dinner matter? Shouldn&#039;t everyone be considerate of others and at least make an effort allow everyone to enjoy what they can of their leisure time?

It&#039;s silly to assume that everyone is against you if you have children and it&#039;s silly to assume that parents are being malicious when they bring their kids out. Making these assumptions is what causes the problems in the first place, whereas if everyone just acted like polite human beings, we&#039;d be okay.
