				Are there any XM users? I was wondering what radio frequency you use around Astoria (mainly by Astoria Park). I use 88.9 or 88.1, but I never get clear reception. I have the XM2GO - so maybe that&#39;s why my signal is never as strong in this area?&nbsp; I get great reception in other states when travelling, except for NYC. <br /><br />Any suggestions?

				I have XM, but I don&#39;t understand your question, you only need to use the FM frquencies to broadcast it to your stereo, if you dont have the base, and no, that doesn&#39;t work very well around here because there are too many radio stations using the nearby frequencies. I&#39;ve found that it&#39;s usually a lot batter to use a tape adapter<br /><br />there are spots where the general reception is not so great.

				First of all I have to say, I love XM!! It&#39;s the Shiznit! <br /><br />I use 107.1 with pretty good success. Albiet, the unit is right next to my radio. The reciever has to be pretty close to your xm2go. Anyway, the signal that comes out of it isn&#39;t really strong enough to give good reception unless it&#39;s right near the radio. I think it&#39;s so that you can broadcast to more than just your home unit. I am pretty sure they sell relay stations for the home but I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s worth it..<br />

I am unable to use the tape adapter because my tape deck has not worked since the day I bought my car. I have the magnetic car antenna and have an additional travel base in my car and keep the XM close to my radio, but still get poor reception. I bought my mother the Roady2 XM and she receives crystal clear reception no matter where she is - so I am guessing it&#39;s my particular model which was designed to not need any base because it has a built-in antenna.&nbsp; Like I said, outside of Astoria I get great reception (and by outside of Astoria - I generally mean outside of NYC itself) using the radio frequency of 88.9 or 88.1. My question was just general - I just wanted to know if there were other frequencies in the area that other XM users use.&nbsp; Thanks for your help.<br /><br />

				Oh.. this is in your car! Try the tape deck anyway! The tape deck doesn&#39;t have to move physical tape through the system. It just needs to make contact with the head. I was having that problem where the deck was eating the tape. But I tried it anyway because the reception was shoddy. Anyway, I think the problem is that the xm2go isn&#39;t strong enough to overcome the other radio signals hitting you antenna.&nbsp; So when you are in Northwestern BumbleFunk,&nbsp; the xm doesn&#39;t have anything to compete with. Another option is, Depending on your car,&nbsp; have a plug installed into your radio for the XM. If you look on crutchfield.com they might have the part you need..&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I tried 107.1 (or 107.9? - it was a CT station) and it worked great. I even got reception near Best Yet and Astoria Park. Thanks for the tip!

				If it was a CT station, it was probably 107.9, aka WEBE 108. Its one of those &quot;Hits of the 70&#39;s, 80&#39;s/adult contemporary&quot; crap stations. Its played at pretty much every doctors office and receptionist&#39;s desk in Fairfield County, and YES I used to have it on at my desk at my old job for background noise, until I got an ipod and plugged computer speakers into that :)
