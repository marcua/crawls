				Hello everybody&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; I just moved into the Ditmars area and I am begining to scope out Astoria for a new local Dj gig.&nbsp; Anyone know of any bars or lounges that opened up recently or places that might be looking for a Dj.&nbsp; I play:&nbsp; Brazilian/World, Funk/Soul, House (all types), Old School Hip Hop, Latin (all types), 60s lounge and nu jazz, 80s new wave, disco and classic/psychedelic rock.<br /><br />My Dj partner and I just did a huge fundraiser called the Great Charity Spin in Long Island City; he almost broke the world record for longest dj set and established the record in NYC for 72 hours (no song was repeated and all genres were played).&nbsp; We have experience doing loft parties, art shows/galleries, clubs, lounges and restaurants in NY and Europe.&nbsp; We have our own equip, but if a place has at least something its a plus (carrying turntables and mixers gets harder every year LOL).<br /><br />If you have any suggestions, let me know.&nbsp; I&#039;d really appreciate it.&nbsp; You can check us out on myspace:<br /><br />http://myspace.com/sambarella<br />http://myspace.com/funkytransducer<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />Sambarella

				I was thinking about the beer garden (when am I not???) and how maybe you could rent out one of those rooms inside. My friend had a wedding party there- with a live band, food etc- and it was so much fun...the beer garden provided all the beer :-D <br /><br />If you charged some sort of cover at the door to offset whatever the price is for renting it out- you could even got together a few other local artists for the evening it could be really neat.<br />I wonder if the beer garden would waive the rental fee if you did it on a weeknight- when they&#039;re not as packed- and did your own advertising?<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure how easy it is to rent out a room- but it&#039;s an idea!<br />It would be awesome to have it outside during the summer- I&#039;ve never seen a DJ out there (usually smaller bands) but it would be great!<br /><br />I&#039;ll try to think of other places as well..I&#039;m a painter and a great music lover as well- and always trying to think of alternative venues to show/perform- as are a lot of people around Astoria....<br />let us know what kind of things you come up with :roll:<br />

				I am actually working on having an Astoria Artist mixer later this month, one of the venues we are talking about is the beer garden.&nbsp; Let me know if you are interested :)&nbsp; I posted it under Creativity and Artists.&nbsp; i actually contacted the manager at the beer garden for djing there but no dice.&nbsp; The past summer we did a couple of the PS1 after parties at the Creek and the Cave in LIC.&nbsp; We play (i am part of a 2 dj duo) all kinds of music depending on the venue, crowd and vibe.&nbsp; My partner actually established the NYC record for longest recorded dj set - 72 hours - in march!&nbsp; We can play anything from house, funk, world, electro, old school hip hop, 80s and new wave, all types of latin, jazz, lounge, and even classic rock lol<br /><br />We also have a electronic music troupe, Gruv Gallery, where we collaborate with musicians to infuse live instrumentation with electronic grooves.&nbsp; In the past we have also been doing our thing in the arts circuit, lots of art shows/openings and fashion shows too, fundraiser benefits etc.&nbsp; Would love to get something cooking locally in a spot with a good vibe.&nbsp; We are lovers of arts and like to put together group art shows as well :-)<br />(http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c60/Sambarella1/blacklogo.jpg)
