			<strong>Johnnyl</strong>:
			<br />
			I am trying to get out of my contract at this wonderful gym because I am moving to Brooklyn and am looking for someone to take over.<br /><br />I&#039;ll pay the $75 transfer fee and I&#039;ll also pay one month for you $(60).<br /><br />The gym is right off the Astoria Ditmars stop and has literally anything you could need (classes, rock wall, day care, etc).<br /><br />Perk of transferring: you save on signup fee and have a shorter term (ends in November).<br /><br />Process: we&#039;d meet at the gym and fill out the paperwork. Should take no more than 15 minutes! <br /><br />Email me if you&#039;re interested! <br /><br />Johnwlombard@gmail.com<br />
