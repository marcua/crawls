				i am getting the bestest xmas gift, all the beads, stones, spacers tools and accessories i need to start up making earrings seriously. i&#39;ve figured out the mechanics (but have yet to apply) of simple drop earrings. but i&#39;m stuck on dangly little clusters. right now i am limited to what i am going to order from the oriental trading catalog (they have a decent selection). it&#39;s good enough to get me started. does anyone make earrings? would you be willing to spill secrets? like local affordable bead &amp; supply shops? or even when i have materials meet over coffee to give me a little lesson-coffee my treat in that case. i&#39;m not familiar with working with wire in this sort of thing. any website or book recommendations are welcome as well.<br />also...i plan on starting a little business with this...would there be interest in purchasing hand made jewelry? when i get some pieces together i&#39;ll post on here to guage having a visual reference.<br />thanks!

				For bead supply stores, you should check out 6 Ave. in Manhattan between 36-38 Sts. - several bead stores which have all the supplies you could need, and how-to books as well.&nbsp; Have fun!

				Too bad I got rid of most of my supplies ... though I might be able to scavenge a bit to see if I have anything of worth left over. I know I had the earring cards and everything ... <br /><br />As for shopping online, for price and selection, I recommend (they also ship really fast):<br /><br />http://www.firemountaingems.com<br /><br />and for very pretty, special stuff (also quick shipping):<br /><br />http://www.embellishmentsinc.com/<br /><br />

				I am also just learning... I got hooked after wandering into a bead shop and putting together black freshwater pearl pendant and earrings on a whim.&nbsp; :-) Without someone to help me finish off the pieces I&#39;m discovering it&#39;s actually quite tricky.&nbsp; :lol:

				Is that why it&#39;s so expensive for handmade jewelry?&nbsp; Some friends of mine have jewelry sales sometimes, but I can never afford to buy any :(&nbsp; And then&nbsp; I feel bad about it.

				Well, I was upstate and the components were surprisingly inexpensive:<br /><br />3 black freshwater pearls<br />6 small sterling silver beads<br />3 sterling silver wires to make them into earrings and pendant<br />= less than $15 with tax<br /><br />The owner helped everyone put their creations together. Here in the city, not only is everything is more expensive, but I found the craft places unfriendly -- I wouldn&#39;t want to ask for help putting a piece together. And some places have classes and charge a lot to attend them, so I&#39;m sure they wouldn&#39;t want to give away their help for free.<br /><br />Then again, when you buy handmade jewelry, you are paying for the supplies and the labor. Just as when you go to a restaurant, you are paying for the cost of the food and the cost of preparing, serving, and cleaning up afterwards!

				thanks for the links satyricon! i&#39;ll be sure to check them out.<br />although i have it &quot;figured out&quot; i still have yet to apply it. i really wish i had made it to one of the jewelry things that walz-astoria did. I have emailed them and they don&#39;t plan on having it back anytime soon...maybe if there&#39;s some interest from us?<br />once i have my goodies i would be up for meeting even if we&#39;re all just figuring stuff out. <br />daisy, you&#39;d be surprised how long it could take to make stuff. one of the girls in my office makes beautiful earrings and necklaces...she uses real gold and precious and semi precious stones only, so i&#39;m working my way up to that standard. she&#39;ll show me whatever i am confused about, but like i said she works with much more expensive materials. she charges around $60 + for her pieces. this one absolutely gorgeous necklace she charged i think $150 (or more) for. Yikes, that&#39;s alot. But, it&#39;s all real gold (she used different stones on different pieces) and it took her 5 hours to finish it. So you really are paying for the time it takes since it is so intricate. <br />don&#39;t worry! i don&#39;t plan to charge a lot for mine!&nbsp; :wink:&nbsp; &nbsp; until i get to my coworkers level..hehehe

				I think that the final cost really comes down to the quality of the materials - there&#39;s a big difference between, say, gold-plate and solid gold.&nbsp; Likewise, a big difference between someone who buys beads at their local bead supply store or someone who travels abroad to buy gemstones and has them cut to specifications.&nbsp; And factor in specialized techniques like soldering and setting stones rather than simply stringing beads on a wire...<br /><br />I imagine that the markup in jewelry might be higher than for other products anyway, because for most people, it&#39;s not exactly an everyday purchase.<br /><br />

				Many years ago, when I was raising babies, I used to make myself safety-pin necklaces to go with special outfits. On one occasion, at a fancy affair with my late husband, this very elegant lady admired my necklace to the point that I was embarrassed. I took it off and gave it to her. She wrote down my name and address and a week later I got a letter and a check for $50.00 from her. She was a buyer for Lord &amp; Taylor. She offered to buy 200 pieces for $50.00 each to sell at the store. They sold for $175.00 on the first floor. The money was the beginning of college funds.<br />(http://static.flickr.com/134/320925106_4dac434800_m.jpg) (http://static.flickr.com/139/320925107_292fc6d6d8_m.jpg)<br />It took me months to get them all done, but every one of them was different. I later went on to do other crafts and also sold them at many different locations around the city. It doesn&#39;t need to be a business, there will always be a vast market for hand crafted jewelry. The more you do your craft the better you get at doing it. Good luck.

				firelight79, I am also starting to work w/jewelry and I&#39;m not an expert by any means, but I have done some earrings.

				Ooooh, will you guys let me know when you&#39;re going? I&#39;d love to tag along. I&#39;m not into jewelry making, but its one of those things that I&#39;ve always wanted to get into, especially since I buy most of my jewelry (which, admittedly, isn&#39;t a lot) from people who hand-make it, I&#39;ve always wanted to learn. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d go there alone, but if you&#39;re going anyway.... :)

				Do any of y&#39;all know how to do jewelry repairs or know who does do them on cheap (street finds) earrings. Mainly things like the post has come off or the earring is bent and doesn&#39;t hang right.
