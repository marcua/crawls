				I saw this as well. <br /><br />The cops, as usual, won&#039;t face any charges for it. In the last year I&#039;ve seen police get off for:<br />- Verbally abusing people<br />- Calling 911 for getting stoned on &#039;special&#039; brownies [confiscated from criminals]<br />- Assaulting skaters<br />- Shooting a female peaceful protestor in the face (http://www.jonesreport.com/articles/170806_rubber_bullets.html)<br />- Etc<br /><br />All of it&#039;s on Youtube. Most of the news articles say the cop gets off with paid leave. So, they get a vacation, nothing else happens.<br /><br />I&#039;m pretty much disenfranchised with the whole system. The system is broken. It&#039;s been broken by both the Democrats AND the Rebublicans, so there&#039;s not really any party that you can point at and say, &quot;The blame lies with those guys.&quot; Really, the blame lies with us, because we&#039;re too caught up in our Nascar, WWF, and football games, and Paris Hilton updates to care.

				I think the taser was use of excessive force, but the kid had already run over his allotted time and wouldn&#039;t give up the mic when he was asked to.&nbsp; What strikes me as odd is why there was no one from the university moderating the Q &amp; A, aside from the police.<br /><br />Anyway, this is an AP piece on what happened: http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hfZBulx_H-prruRU2Clj0dIgUOww.<br /><br />And in the Miami Herald: http://www.miamiherald.com/466/story/241219.html<br /><br />

				Isn&#039;t there a sound guy there ?

				I think this guy Meyer was trying for a bit of performance art, which he didn&#039;t expect would spiral out of control.<br /><br />He seemed to already be agitated before the mike was turned off, and that behavior usually triggers police, especially when there&#039;s a public gathering with a high-profile person. For all the police knew, this guy might have become totally unhinged and done something dangerous. Doesn&#039;t seem likely in hindsight, but I&#039;m sure that was the rationale behind their decision to use excessive force.<br /><br />Also, I highly doubt university police represent the more professionally-minded in law enforcement.....<br /><br />If you look at his website, yeah, he&#039;s into performing. www.theandrewmeyer.com<br /><br />And frankly, I think Meyer&#039;s a little kooky with the S&amp;C nonsense. Factor everything in, his behavior, the poor response of the police, lack of a moderator as someone mentioned, a post-Virginia Tech university venue, and a high-profile and controversial Senator, and yeah, that&#039;s what happens.
