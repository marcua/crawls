				Let me preface this by saying, I&#39;ve known the columnist of this op/ed piece since 3rd grade, and am so proud to be his friend.&nbsp; He&#39;s finishing his doctorate in poli-sci at Yale, and soon to be a professor at Northwestern.&nbsp; But he brings up some very legitimate points on how the democrats can grow the party and its electorate.&nbsp; You have to log in to the website, but it&#39;s free to view this page.<br /><br />http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/03/opinion/03galvin.html?_r=1&amp;oref=login

				Howard Dean is doing a very smart thing with his 50 state strategy.&nbsp; I think it will bear fruit in the long-term.&nbsp; I still contend, however, that abolishing the &quot;constituency desks&quot; will end up hurting us.&nbsp; The idea that anyone and everyone should be doing outreach to all Democratic constituents is a good thing, and one that I think everyone would agree with - but the without people who know their communities and are charged with performing set tasks (targeted literature, fundraising, parade contingents, lists, endorsements, press conferences) in each of the big Democratic constituencies, I think things will fall through the crack.<br />Great article though - and a good topic.
