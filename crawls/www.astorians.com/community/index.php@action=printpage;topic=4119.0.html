				My share buddy doesn&#39;t like &#39;em, so I&#39;ve been getting all of them. I still have a few leftover and it looks like I&#39;ll get more tonight. I like &#39;em, but I need some fresh ideas! Ideally savory stuff, but I&#39;ll take sweet recipes too..

				I&#39;ve also just been eating them like a potato. Scrub them, then bake for an hour. Cut open and eat with butter, salt and pepper. I&#39;ve been using French butter, French grey sea salt, and either fresh-ground pepper or homemade garam masala on them, with excellent results. :)<br /><br />I also have a great roasted sweet potato salad recipe (http://harrissmithrecipes.xwiki.com/xwiki/bin/view/Main/RoastedSweetPotatoSalad)....<br /><br />Oh, and unlike potatoes, they only keep a week or so... I roasted one after a week and it was tough and unpleasant inside...

				I came up with this last year, and made it with both sweet potatoes and winter squash:<br /><br />Acorn Squash Mock Souffle<br /><br />8 oz. cooked squash or sweet potato<br />6 oz. andouille sausage, diced (to make it vegetarian, use sliced portabello mushrooms sprinkled with <br />Cajun seasoning)<br />1 onion, diced<br />1 Tbsp olive oil<br />1 oz. shredded cheddar<br />1 large egg<br />3 Tbsp half and half<br />kosher or sea salt<br />pepper<br /><br />Preheat the oven to 325F. While acorn squash is cooking, brown the sausage and onion in a skillet over medium heat in the olive oil. Drain and set aside. <br /><br />When squash is tender, remove flesh from skin and place in mixing bowl. Let cool. Mix thoroughly with cheese, egg and half and half. Add slightly cooled sausage and onion and mix well. Add salt and pepper to taste. Put mixture in 2 cup baking dish, and bake in oven for about 25 minutes.<br /><br />2 servings.<br /><br />Another one:<br /><br />Winter Squash Soup with Roasted Red Pepper Puree<br /><br />This is based on a pair of recipes I found on Epicurious.&nbsp; They are put together in the original, but I modified each one slightly.<br /><br />2 1/2 pounds winter squash, roasted<br />4 garlic cloves, roasted<br />2 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil<br />1 medium onion, chopped<br />2.5 to 3 cups good stock or broth, chicken or vegetable<br />2 Tbsp half and half<br />kosher salt to taste<br />ground white pepper to taste<br />Roasted Red Pepper Puree (below)<br /><br />Cut ends off of garlic cloves but do not peel all outer paper off.&nbsp; Place on a piece of foil, sprinkle with salt and olive oil.&nbsp; Seal foil and bake at 350 for 45 minutes to an hour, or until completely soft.&nbsp; Halve squash and place on a rimmed baking sheet, cut side down.&nbsp; Bake at 350 for an hour, or until completely soft and caramelising.&nbsp; After removing from oven, scrape squash meat into a bowl along with the roasted garlic cloves.<br /><br />Heat oil in 3 qt. soup pot over medium heat.&nbsp; Add onions and a pinch of kosher salt and saut√© until about half have caramelised.&nbsp; The rest will be melty soft.&nbsp; Add squash and garlic; stir.&nbsp; Slowly add stock, about one cup at a time, and start pureeing carefully with an immersion blender.&nbsp; (Alternatively, place onions, squash and garlic in a blender, and start blending in stock one cup at a time.&nbsp; Thin to desired thinness.&nbsp; I was aiming for a thick, silky soup, and I found that about 2.5 cups of stock gave me that.<br /><br />Blend in half and half and adjust seasoning.&nbsp; Serve in large bowl with a dollop of red pepper puree in the middle.&nbsp; Do not completely stir in red pepper puree to eat; instead, enjoy the different strengths of each puree in each bite.<br /><br />Roasted red pepper puree<br /><br />1 large red pepper<br />1-2 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil<br />1 clove garlic<br />pinch salt<br /><br />Roast pepper under broiler or over stove (or you can use jarred roasted peppers).&nbsp; After peeling, chop coarsly and blend with olive oil, garlic and salt in small bowl of food processor.<br /><br />3-4 servings.<br /><br />

				Peel sweet potatoes and cut into your preferred fry size.<br /><br />Toss with olive oil, garlic powder, paprika and salt. <br /><br />Bake at 400-ish, stirring occasionally, until done. <br /><br />Mix mayonnaise with a little adobo sauce, maybe a touch of mustard if you want. <br /><br />Dunk sweet potato fries in adobo mayo. <br /><br />Tell me that don&#39;t taste good.

				Thinly sliced and deep-fried.&nbsp; Mmmmm . . .&nbsp; sweet potato chips.&nbsp; Sweet and salty.&nbsp; Oh yeah. Plus, does not require the use of French mustard or, well, anything French.

				I hated sweet potatoes until I discovered the you could make them savory. Now I actually look forward to them.<br />Yesterday I just cooked mine up with chives and fresh rosemary, and salt and pepper. They were yummy.

				Biscuits are good... but now what am I supposed to do with 30 biscuits?!?&nbsp; <br /><br />Thankfully I re-read the recipe.&nbsp; I thought the yield was &quot;4&quot; when I read it the first time.&nbsp; I was thinking, hmmm those must be Texas sized biscuits.&nbsp; I so need 8.&nbsp; I made Texas sized biscuits and I got 30.&nbsp; Thank goodness I didn&#39;t go for 60.<br /><br />And also, yum.<br /><br />cheers,<br />jayme<br />

				So I went home for Thanksgiving craving these biscuits after digging out the recipe, prepared to peel the sweet potatoes myself if need be so that we could bake them.<br /><br />Lo and behold, my mother already had a freezer stocked with them and we didn&#39;t even have to worry about it.<br /><br />She used a different recipe, though, which doesn&#39;t use shortening (I think it used butter) and also had some spices (cinnamon and ginger, I think).&nbsp; Very yummy!<br /><br />It probably goes without saying that the recipe can be messed with, but just &quot;food for thought&quot;, so to speak.
