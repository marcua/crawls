			Forgive me, it&#39;s monday and i&#39;m stuck on stupid. It&#39;s been about 10 yrs since I have processed my own b+w film, but I have recently decided to start getting back into photography. (Like most ppl, I took b+w in school). I never payed (or is it paid?) close attention to it when I was in school so I was hoping someone here could tell me what the processing differences are. I am familar with b+w, but have no clue about color. <br /><br />I&#39;ve started to gather up darkroom supplies, but was curious to know if you can process color film at home too?<br /><br />Thx,<br />V.<br />

			I&#39;ve been shooting only digital recently - but I think it&#39;s super expensive to process + make prints of color stuff in the darkroom.&nbsp; I could be mistaken though.

			I think it requires lots more chemicals.<br /><br /><br />--- Quote ---Minilabs have taken the fun (if there ever was any) out of color printing. If you only shoot in color, it may make more sense to find a reliable lab and let them do the hard work. But Black-and-white is a different story. Black and white, because of its relative ease of processing, is easier to control; as a result, many darkroom enthusiasts are able to make interpretive prints that say more than any machine print can say.<br />--- End quote ---<br /><br />taken from here: http://www.photogs.com/bwworld/bwdarkrm1.html

			And I think you have to precisely control temperature of the water bath too... <br /><br />Incidentally, for B&amp;W, with a digital camera, you can take a color photo then in Picasa/iPhoto/photoshop you can desaturate the color. At least in Picasa, you can pretend you took the photo with any number of filters, which changes the effect a lot. This is a much better thing to do then to set your camera to B&amp;W mode... Here&#39;s one of mine I did that with:<br /><br />
