				Yes, I saw that last week. Yikes. <br /><br />Just to be clear, it&#039;s not Cecil Adams who waterboarded himself, it&#039;s a regular from his message boards, who is reportedly a bit of a far-right wacko in other contexts.

				Around when the whole waterboarding controversy first broke, I saw a documentary by an investigative reporter who volunteered to undergo the torture. It was even administered by former government interrogators. Pretty frightening.

				There are journalists (James Taranto from the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, for example), who question whether waterboarding is torture in the proper sense because of the willingness of people to undergo it voluntarily.&nbsp; There have been stories of anti-war activists waterboarding each other as political theatre on the streets, for example.&nbsp; I&#039;m not necessarily saying this is my viewpoint, but it&#039;s interesting.

				Bill, do you have a link to the Taranto article?<br /><br />Identifying (or not) the practice as torture when committed against someone who <em>volunteers</em> to be waterboarded is semantical. Still, it doesn&#039;t take into account those who clearly don&#039;t volunteer for such treatment.<br /><br />To me, it comes down to the &quot;bedfellows argument&quot;: do I want the United States military to engage in interrogation tactics used by groups like the Khmer Rouge or the Gestapo?

				Got a few thumbs down on that last one.<br /><br />First of all, I never said I was <em>for</em> waterboarding or torture.&nbsp; I think that Harlan was making a satirical &quot;modest proposal,&quot; so I asked some follow up questions to further discuss his thoughts on the issue.<br /><br />Second of all, I think that the whole thumbs down thing is beyond craven.&nbsp; I&#039;m used to my ideas being unpopular because I lean slightly to the right and we are in a city with diverse views ranging from left to extreme left.&nbsp; But, i would much rather discuss ideas.&nbsp; Instead of popping me a thumbs down from the shadows, why don&#039;t you challenge my ideas?

People&#039;s bodies can only withstand so much, and even less one&#039;s mind under that kind of extreme stress and torture. Even if the &quot;terrorist&quot; means to tell actual valuable information at that point, their memory is not reliable. <br /><br />There is an actual reason why the Supreme Court banned the use of third degree interrogation tactics (those involving physical &quot;persuasion&quot;) - it makes it more likely that innocent people will confess to things they did not do as well as negatively impacting the reliability of actual perpetrators&#039; memory. It just doesn&#039;t make sense to use these kinds of tactics when they reduce the diagnosticity of whether the information we receive is good or bad.

				That is fascinating.&nbsp; Was the intent to learn how the Nazi mind worked, deconstruct their reasoning skills, etc.?&nbsp; Or was the intent to sort of bond with the Nazis so that they would be more prone to helping their American captors out?&nbsp; Do you think that there are cultural barriers that would prevent that tactic from working here?&nbsp; We probably had more in common with Germans in the late 40s and 50s than we do with our detainees now.&nbsp; Or do you just mean, in general, that kindness is a sort of universal language which greases the skids and would get them to share information?

				I can&#039;t see the point of learning how their minds work, as i don&#039;t think there is that much variety in human minds. You are probably right that WW II -era American and German soldiers probably had more in common than American soldiers and Guantanamo Bay detainees. I have no idea whether that might make a difference in the effectiveness (although if it did I&#039;m sure it&#039;s possible to bring in Arab-American soldiers to perform the interogation, which would eliminate that problem). <br /><br />What I do think is that the reported success of this method bears further reporting and analysis. And I think it&#039;s worth trying. <br /><br />I question whether the point of torture is really to acquire information or to facilitate the enjoyment of the torturer - what kind of person goes into that line of business? Someone who loves inflicting pain, or someone who loves getting valuable information? (not being sarcastic) Do we really get more/better info out of people by stripping them naked than we would by injecting them with truth serum? (Seriously, i have no idea.)

				Well, those are definitely some interesting ideas.&nbsp; I had thought that I read somewhere that truth serum wasn&#039;t very effective, but I could be wrong.&nbsp; This is a unique situation; on the one hand, we don&#039;t want to know what goes on in shadowy places like Guantanamo.&nbsp; Whether we believe in the aims of the U.S. government or not, those kinds of places are unsavory by their nature.&nbsp; On the other hand, we are all sort of responsible for knowing what goes on there.

The idea is minimize the seriousness of the crime and to get the suspect to think you are on his/her side, which makes it psychologically easier to confess. Unfortunately, research has also shown that this gets people to provide false confessions too. The problem with interrogation is that the combination of tactics can lead vulnerable people to make false confessions. Then when you add in situational factors like sleep deprivation, food deprivation, etc. you really run the risk of getting false information from people. Though there are some promising leads in psychological research as far as developing better interrogation tactics, it is still really in its infancy in figuring out better ways of doing things rather than showing what&#039;s wrong with the currently utilized tactics. The other problem, as you mentioned, is that this research doesn&#039;t look at cultural differences in developing interrogation techniques, which limits it utility for training terrorist suspects of foreign origins. Then again, the leading trainers of interrogators in this country train people all over the world (including the Middle East), which shows that some techniques work on people of all cultures. <br /><br />Truth serum is very ineffective. It actually makes people more likely to again report false memories or distort true memories to the tune of what is being suggested by the interviewer.

This thread has nothing to do with people with the Islamic faith, and everything to do with torture that our government inflicts on people identified as militants, all of whom are not Muslim, or militants.

				I just heard a review of this movie, Taxi to the Dark Side (http://www.taxitothedarkside.com/). <br /><br /><br />LA Times Review (http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/cl-et-darkside18jan18,0,6041895.story?coll=cl-movies-features)<br />&quot;Yet what is most distressing about &quot;Taxi&quot; is not physical acts but psychological ones. What is really appalling is how readily torture was embraced by officials as an absolute necessity and how easy it was for soldiers to, in the words of one, &quot;lose your moral bearings&quot; and become a party to atrocity.&quot;
