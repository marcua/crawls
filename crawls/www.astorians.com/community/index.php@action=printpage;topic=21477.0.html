				It&#039;s time for an Astoria Spring. <br />Let&#039;s form a committee to finally dislodge the professional political dynasty that is helping to turn a once-charming neighorhood into a trendy slum.<br />Let&#039;s start with Vallone Jr., who reportedly has nearly a million dollars in his campaign war chest to run for Borough President, most of it from real-estate developers and other self-interested miscreants. <br />We can start by putting together a series of narratives,&nbsp; snapshots, photos, videos, etc. of what the quality of&nbsp; life is really like in the district where the chair of the Public Safety Committee of the NYC Council supposedly resides. (The evidence suggests that he lives far away from the borough.) <br />Send me your ideas.

				I second that notion. Please give a detailed list with verifable sources as to what this man has accomplished aside from plastering his name on anything that stands still, allowing the historic structures of Astoria to be razed to the ground for ugly mass structures that pack in too many residents for our infrastructure. Please tell us what he has done to fight the litter issue (please see the fresh berry farm link in the general boards) and plase explain why his &quot;fast and furious noise pollution&quot; passed in 2004 has yet to curb the noise pollution of drag racing in this neighborhood. Please explain the rise in crime specifically last year where we had 5 murders in Astoria. <br />&nbsp;<br />It is time for the Vallone dynasty to be overturned. He serves the seniors and only the seniors...i.e his voting base. Loverly folks those astoria seniors, but they are not the only ones who live here.

				I&#039;ve lived here all my life and I can&#039;t stand Vallone. He goes on the most ridiculous crusades against some things, while letting other things that have a much greater impact on the immediate neighborhood go unaddressed. He can be blamed, in part, for the uptick in crime since the 114 has lost a great number of officers. Why isn&#039;t he pushing to increase staffing? <br /><br />The real turn off for me, though, was when he was all over the news, ranting about some guy who tossed his mail in a public trash can, without knowing anything more about the situation -- maybe the guy was cleaning out his car, maybe he was reading his mail on a nearby bench and decided to toss the junk before heading home, who knows? But IIRC, he resorted to juvenile name calling to describe a constituent -- extremely unprofessional and made him look like a total ass. Astoria has much bigger issues than one old guy tossing his mail in a trash can, but Vallone went after the guy like he was public enemy no. 1. <br />

				The guy is a councilman, so his reach is really not that far. He can&#039;t create laws, but can really only take care of small problems.<br /><br /><br />I am not sure where to find it, but I would like to see his voting record in City Council to see what he has been for and against...because the City Council passes some pretty dumb legislation.<br /><br /><br />Otherwise, a good councilman is measured by what they accomplish for the average person. When I have lived in other towns, when I wrote to or called my councilman, things got done. My problems, no matter how small, were fixed. Lights in a park, curb damage, various unsafe conditions. <br /><br /><br />So does Vallone handle that stuff? I really don&#039;t know. I know that he push community watch programs pretty hard which I like. Otherwise I haven&#039;t interacted with his office much.<br /><br /><br />But if you don&#039;t like what Astoria is &quot;becoming&quot; because hipsters are here, then that isn&#039;t his fault, and you probably have to just get over the fact that this is an important neighborhood that will grow and change whether you like it or not. Crime isn&#039;t his fault...it&#039;s on the rise everywhere. If you complain about crime then I expect you are involved with the Community Watch program and playing your own part as well, right?
