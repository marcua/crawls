				Just got a bid accepted for a place in North Queensview. Very excited about it, but some of the board rules are a little draconian. No TV between 10pm and 8am? 5 days notice for non family to stay overnight?<br /><br />Does anyone on here have any first hand experience in the co-op? Are they heavy handed in their enforcement, or will I be able to watch Conan without having to DVR for the next day?<br /><br />Thanks for the help.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;

				Angus,<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure where you got this information, but this is certainly not the case. That&#039;s hilarious, actually. I just sent you a PM in response to your email as well.

				We are about to close on an apartment there.&nbsp; Board interview was hellish because of one jerk on the board.<br />Rules do look and seem tough but I can understand some of them.<br />We have been told by owners there that yes the rules are tough but not to worry.&nbsp; Go about your life and respect others, which works for us.<br />Property manager is very tough but seems fair.<br /><br />Waiting to close and hope to be moved in by July 15.&nbsp; Best of luck to you and your family.<br />Email if you want more info including names for renovations.

				Hey Pork, <br /><br />Can you describe what stalled you with that guy? What kind of a feeling did you get from the board? Do you have any ideas of their likes/dislikes? And how long did the closing process take for you? Any and all information is greatly appreciated. <br /><br />Thanks!<br />angus

				We just moved in last week.<br /><br />I never heard of that no TV thing.&nbsp; The main objective is to be respectful and not blast music late at night and stuff like that.<br /><br />The rules are strict mainly in regards to renovations, to ensure the integrity of the structures and that nobody is doing anything that could cause harm/damage to the building and neighbors.&nbsp; Other than that, it&#039;s not bad at all.<br /><br />There are a lot of kids and many people in the community are very friendly...so if you have children or are planning on it I would say that it is a good place to be.<br /><br />The grounds are well kept, the building common areas are very clean, security patrols actually patrol, and the co-op is run well.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I re-read the rule I was talking about TV-wise, and it seems I was a bit confused by the legaleese. <br /><br />&quot;No Lessee shall play upon or suffer to be played upon any musical instrument, radio or television in the demised premises between the hours of ten o&#039;clock p.m and the following eight o&#039;clock a.m if the same shall disturb or annoy other occupants of the building.&quot;<br /><br />I took that to mean that you couldn&#039;t watch TV after 10:00, but I guess what it&#039;s actually saying is that a reasonable volume is expected. My concers are assuaged! North Queensview seems to be great.
