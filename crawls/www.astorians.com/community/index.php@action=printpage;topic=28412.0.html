				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="font-family: Times;" class="bbc_font">Free Social Anxiety Support &amp; Treatment Program at Queens College<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;If you live with Social Anxiety Disorder you may be interested to know that the Queens College Psychological Center is currently offering, as part of their community service mission, a free Social Anxiety Support &amp; Treatment Program (SASTP).&nbsp; SASTP is based on extensive research, and provides a safe, comfortable, respectful and accepting environment in which to learn about the impact of social anxiety disorder through the life cycle, learn specific skills targeted to helping develop healthy relationships and connectedness, and break through social anxiety&#039;s interference with achieving goals and potential, as well as to enhance self-esteem, acceptance and well-being.&nbsp; For more information regarding the SASTP please email your contact information (phone number where you may be reached, best time to call you, and if it is okay to leave a message) to: QCPC@qc.cuny.edu (QCPC@qc.cuny.edu)&nbsp; or call 718-570-0500. Visit us at www.qc.cuny.edu/QCPC (http://www.qc.cuny.edu/QCPC)&nbsp; &nbsp;Please share this with anyone who may benefit from this information.&nbsp; Thank you. <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;What is Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD)? SAD is characterized by excessive anxiety and self-consciousness in everyday social situations. People with SAD have a persistent, intense, and chronic fear of being judged by others and of being embarrassed or humiliated by their own actions. While recognizing that their fear of being around people is unreasonable, they cannot control the worry, and often experience low self-esteem and depression. SAD can be limited to only one type of situation (e.g. fear of speaking in formal or informal situations), or may broadly impact making or keeping relationships. Physical symptoms can accompany the intense anxiety&nbsp; (e.g. blushing, profuse sweating, trembling, and other symptoms of anxiety, including difficulty talking and nausea or other stomach discomfort.) <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</span>[size=0pt]<span style="font-family: Times;" class="bbc_font">Queens College Psychological Center is located on the Queens College Campus at 65-30 Kissena Blvd, Flushing, Queens.&nbsp; For more information please call at: 718-570-0500 or email at QCPC@qc.cuny.edu (QCPC@qc.cuny.edu) Visit us at http: www.qc.cuny.edu/QCPC (http://www.qc.cuny.edu/QCPC)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Queens College Psychological Center (QCPC) offers compassionate, high quality, evidence-based, psychological services for children, adolescents, and adults. Treatment is provided by doctoral candidates in the Clinical Psychology at Queens College Doctoral Program who are closely supervised by experienced and licensed faculty. All services are confidential and available to the community regardless of ability to pay.
