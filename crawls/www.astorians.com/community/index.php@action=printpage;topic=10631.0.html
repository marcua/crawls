				http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1809168,00.html<br /><br />This is a really great article about the Campaign in Puerto Rico.&nbsp; The possibility of statehood has been put to the test many times in PR&#039;s history, and each time it is voted down by its citizens, who seem equally divided on the issue.&nbsp; Much of PR is very poor, and tourism supports a lot of the island.&nbsp; I&#039;m going to visit relatives this summer, and I&#039;m curious to see how much has changed, and whether or not anyone has a computer and email yet.&nbsp; It is a very happy place, and the days go slowly.

				As far as the U.S. Government is concerned, dual citizenship is not a problem in most cases:<br /><br />From: http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1753.html<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The concept of dual nationality means that a person is a citizen of two countries at the same time. Each country has its own citizenship laws based on its own policy.Persons may have dual nationality by automatic operation of different laws rather than by choice. For example, a child born in a foreign country to U.S. citizen parents may be both a U.S. citizen and a citizen of the country of birth.<br /><br />A U.S. citizen may acquire foreign citizenship by marriage, or a person naturalized as a U.S. citizen may not lose the citizenship of the country of birth.&nbsp; <strong>U.S. law does not mention dual nationality or require a person to choose one citizenship or another. Also, a person who is automatically granted another citizenship does not risk losing U.S. citizenship.</strong> However, a person who acquires a foreign citizenship by applying for it may lose U.S. citizenship. <strong>In order to lose U.S. citizenship, the law requires that the person must apply for the foreign citizenship voluntarily, by free choice, and with the intention to give up U.S. citizenship.</strong><br /><br />Intent can be shown by the person&#039;s statements or conduct.The U.S. Government recognizes that dual nationality exists but does not encourage it as a matter of policy because of the problems it may cause. Claims of other countries on dual national U.S. citizens may conflict with U.S. law, and dual nationality may limit U.S. Government efforts to assist citizens abroad. The country where a dual national is located generally has a stronger claim to that person&#039;s allegiance.<br /><br />However, dual nationals owe allegiance to both the United States and the foreign country. They are required to obey the laws of both countries. Either country has the right to enforce its laws, particularly if the person later travels there.Most U.S. citizens, including dual nationals, must use a U.S. passport to enter and leave the United States. Dual nationals may also be required by the foreign country to use its passport to enter and leave that country. <strong>Use of the foreign passport does not endanger U.S. citizenship.</strong>&nbsp; Most countries permit a person to renounce or otherwise lose citizenship.<br /><br />Information on losing foreign citizenship can be obtained from the foreign country&#039;s embassy and consulates in the United States. Americans can renounce U.S. citizenship in the proper form at U.S. embassies and consulates abroad.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />and, from: http://travel.state.gov/law/citizenship/citizenship_778.html<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">POTENTIALLY EXPATRIATING ACTS<br /><br />Section 349 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1481), as amended, states that U.S. citizens are subject to loss of citizenship i<strong>f they perform certain specified acts voluntarily <span class="bbc_u">and with the intention to relinquish U.S. citizenship.</span></strong> Briefly stated, these acts include:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;1. obtaining naturalization in a foreign state (Sec. 349 (a) (1) INA);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;2. taking an oath, affirmation or other formal declaration to a foreign state or its political subdivisions (Sec. 349 (a) (2) INA);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;3. entering or serving in the armed forces of a foreign state engaged in hostilities against the U.S. or serving as a commissioned or non-commissioned officer in the armed forces of a foreign state (Sec. 349 (a) (3) INA);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;4. accepting employment with a foreign government if (a) one has the nationality of that foreign state or (b) an oath or declaration of allegiance is required in accepting the position (Sec. 349 (a) (4) INA);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;5. formally renouncing U.S. citizenship before a U.S. diplomatic or consular officer outside the United States (sec. 349 (a) (5) INA);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;6. formally renouncing U.S. citizenship within the U.S. (but only under strict, narrow statutory conditions) (Sec. 349 (a) (6) INA);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;7. conviction for an act of treason (Sec. 349 (a) (7) INA).</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				<br />http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/06/01/schneider-how-did-clinton-win-big/<br /><br />Seems anyone who breathed voted for a possible VP.<br />Then apparently there were protest rallies against the primary, supported also by some Clinton supporters.<br /><br /><br /><br />&#039;According to CNN&#039;s exit polls, 60 percent of Puerto Ricans who participated in the primary favor statehood, and Clinton won 82 percent of those voters. Neither Clinton or Barack Obama have directly said they favor statehood for the island, but Clinton said earlier this week she thinks Puerto Ricans should be able to vote in the general election.&#039;

				They should have the final say. We&#039;ve had them with us a long time, let them vote on it, and let that be it. Or declare them independent.&nbsp; &nbsp;It &#039;s unfair to keep them a halfway state.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				It should be up to the people of PR to decide for themselves. Granted-the vote is usually split but more are in favor of keeping the status quo.<br />I can tell you that due to the potential tax increase should PR become a state, my family would most likely have to sell every last inch of property as we couldn&#039;t afford it. We can barely afford it now. And it is a substantial working farm (most money we generate from the farm itself is from avocados, bananas, corn, lemons and other various fruits, veggies and herbs....I have to go back for a visit soon...sigh). It&#039;s also where my mother and 10 siblings were born and raised. And where she plans to retire in 4 years and one month (not that she&#039;s counting down to 65 or anything).
