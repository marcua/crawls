				Really?&nbsp; I didn&#039;t like it at all.&nbsp; It&#039;s got a fun routine with the way the whole set up works.&nbsp; But it&#039;s by no means a healthy yogurt option.&nbsp; But for a fun dessert event, it&#039;s alright.&nbsp; Probably more so late night, and not entirely sober.&nbsp; But they can&#039;t even come close to touching Red Mango if you want some serious all natural frozen yogurt.

				I think the appeal to Mamas are the different flavors, and the low fat options. Where else can you get low fat cake batter, or no sugar added cheesecake, with all your funky toppings too?<br /><br />I for one happened to like the different flavors. Now is their chocolate the best I&#039;ve had ... I dunno, but I haven&#039;t seen another place serving peanut butter flavored fro yo in Astoria.&nbsp;

				I really liked the flavors. Its true they dont have a very strong Yogurty flavor - but thats not what i was looking for as that takes away from my peanut butter flavor :-)<br /><br />

				If you love rich, full flavors like that and don&#039;t care so much if it&#039;s yogurt, you really need to try Malu on Jackson Avenue in LIC.&nbsp; It&#039;s about the most amazing ice cream I&#039;ve ever tasted.&nbsp; I&#039;m not kidding.&nbsp; http://amomandpopshop.com/ (http://amomandpopshop.com/)

				I almost came here a few weeks ago, but the guy working said they had no non-fat yogurts.. so I passed.&nbsp; Then, the other day on my want Red Mango, I stopped in and surprise, they have a plethora of low-fat and non-fat yogurts.&nbsp; Pumpkin, banana, and some other yummies.&nbsp; Yeah, you can make fro-yo fatty easy, but with the right pieces you can make it a non-guilty treat.<br /><br /><br />But... it&#039;s no Twirlz or Red Mango, imho :)

				While I do like the idea of self serve yogurt, MAMA&#039;s was not good.&nbsp; My girlfriend and I went.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t care for mine but finished it, my girlfriend only ate half before tossing it.&nbsp; I forget which flavors we got, but they all seemed to taste good at first but after a while not so much.&nbsp; We both much prefer Red Mango.
