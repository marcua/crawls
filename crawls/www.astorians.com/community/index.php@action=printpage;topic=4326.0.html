				What are everyone&#39;s experience with JH?&nbsp; I&#39;ve never lived there but am curious after hearing some good things the past few years.&nbsp; It&#39;s funny, when I was a kid (grew up south B&#39;klyn), Jackson Heights was generally regarded as an immense shithole.&nbsp; Of course, so was much of manhattan north of 86th street so things change.<br /><br />I&#39;m looking to buy.&nbsp; Not now, maybe not next year, but in the near future and am trying to consider neighborhoods I haven&#39;t before.&nbsp; I&#39;ve visited JH some and tried to get a feel for the area but it doesn&#39;t substitute for others&#39; real experience.&nbsp; <br /><br />What do you think of the neighborhood, especially as compared to Astoria?<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I went looking for to buy there a year ago.&nbsp; The apartments are really big and for the most part very nice.&nbsp; Views can be lacking if you don&#39;t face the street.&nbsp; I probably would have bought if they weren&#39;t all coops with high mtn fees.&nbsp; But I liked the areas especially 74th St area and 81st Elmhurst.&nbsp; &nbsp;81st reminded me of Steinway St with the shopping, and there are tree lined streets away from the main drags in both areas, and the developments have nice courtyards.&nbsp; Honestly, it reminded me of Astoria and Woodside alot.&nbsp; Lots of people are moving there and the commute can be pretty good.&nbsp; Good restaurants too.&nbsp; Time Out had some articles on it recently, maybe you should do some research online, and go looking at apartments - there&#39;s a lot to see, ads abound.&nbsp; I beleive the area will pick up and already is.&nbsp; Good luck.

				I&#39;ve always liked Jackson Heights.&nbsp; I like the energy of the neighborhood and the garden apartment complexes.&nbsp; I prefer Astoria, but if I lived anywhere else in Queens, it would be Jackson Heights.&nbsp; It&#39;s close to many train lines, has wonderful restaurants and the apartments tend to be a bit bigger, on average, than the ones we have have in Astoria.

				i never liked living there. there was something about it that always made me want to leave. i never found anything other than the history of the neighborhood interesting. it&#39;s very dull, with little to do. restaurants are either indian or mexican/colombian etc. there are no green spaces, the park is all concrete. i never felt like there was a real community spirit. there&#39;s no social scene..no coffee shops or decent bars...no places where i would want to eat out. i also think the neighborhood is dirty, and has gotten worse; i don&#39;t particular feel safe despite growing up on a &quot;nice&quot; street. i have no real reason to go to JH, especially now that my mom moved in with her sister in douglaston and my brother has the apartment. maybe the stray piece of mail. i just never liked the neighborhood very much, you couldn&#39;t pay me enough to go back.

It was fine, but that&#39;s it. Other Indian restaurants I&#39;ve enjoyed a lot more are Spicy Mina, in Woodside, Mughlai on the UWS, and Saravanaas in Curry Hill... There are some good Dosa places in Jackson Heights too, but I don&#39;t remember the names... What&#39;s your fave, NYCaTX?

Easy to find, look for all the yellow cabs. They have a counter to eat at but no place to sit. We usually get a plate and then sit on the stoop next door - where someone has written on the steps &quot;If you don&#39;t live here, don&#39;t sit here&quot; - because, you know, I&#39;m such a rebel........

				I agree with McDirk - I really like Jackson Heights, and it was the other area in Queens I was considering when I first moved here (6 years ago). I like all the different ethnic restaurants, the diversity, the garden apartments, the train lines, etc. <br /><br />However, now that I&#39;ve been here longer, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d want to live there and could definitely see what firelight is talking about. I think it might not have as much of a community feel as Astoria does (but that could just be b/c I&#39;m here in Astoria and have a better feel for it), and I think it can be dirtier and noisier. Plus, the lack of green space is a definite downside. I really love having Astoria Park and the waterfront closeby (though of course that will depend where in Astoria you are).

It&#39;s around 81st street and above teh subway line. I think above the avenue where most of the restaurants are. He likes it a lot (he owns) and lives in a nice section of the neighborhood.<br /><br />For me it&#39;s too congested, especially around the train station. Even more than say Woodside. But I guess it&#39;s worth exploring if you&#39;re thinking about getting a place there.
