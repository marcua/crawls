				What I actually did:<br /><br />It turned out that I was just hallucinating the lentils. so I cooked up some white beans with garlic, onion and bay leaves.<br /><br />I cooked up with beet greens and swiss chard with onions, carrots and garlic and lots of olive oil. Put it in the same bowl with some of the beans and some sharp italian cheese. Don&#39;t ask me the name, I can&#39;t pronounce it. Or remember it. I just picked it up on arthur ave. <br /><br />Anyway, it made a quite respectable supper. <br /><br />I also roasted the beets with the rest of the carrots and some onion. Not sure what will happen with that yet.

				I&#39;ve never been to Indian for dissertation research, but I do think that there should be an Academic Astorians outing at some point. Tweed jackets and fake British accents would of course be mandatory. Perhaps after the academic year starts, but when Anzubird is not on a dig...?<br /><br />ObIronChef: This is exceedingly silly. But I could be convinced to help, preferably behind the camera. I suspect sound and lighting would be the biggest problems to making a decent video!

				1. The secret ingredient should have something to do with astoria - a traditional greek ingredient or something. Or something from the CSA. <br /><br />Anyway, it can&#39;t be revealed yet! The judges will have to decide on it, keep it quiet, and buy tons of it for us to cook with.<br /><br />Hmm. The secret ingredient should also be CHEAP (unless we find a really rich judge). <br /><br />The teams can have a couple of pre-show meetings to talk strategy and be prepared for whatever comes that way.

				Your dissertation topic sounds really interesting, anzubird.&nbsp; Hope we can meet and chat sometime!<br /><br />I spent three months in India, so I was able to see quite a bit.&nbsp; The sites I went to were: Ajanta, Ellora, Kanheri, Bhaja, Karla, and Elephanta (OK, not Buddhist) in Maharashtra; Sanchi in Madhya Pradesh; Sarnath in Uttar Pradesh; and a couple of sites around Cuttack in Orissa.&nbsp; Basically, I made a big counter-clockwise circle.&nbsp; I also went to the museums in New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bhubaneswar, and Kolkata.&nbsp; It was a pretty amazing trip.&nbsp; I hope to go back sometime.&nbsp; I&#39;m actually working on Silk Road Buddhist cave sites in northwestern China, but some of the iconography I&#39;m looking at has Indo-Tibetan origins, so I decided to go to India and see as much as I could.&nbsp; Oh, I also went to the beach in Goa.&nbsp; &nbsp;:wink: <br /><br />Have you worked on archaeological sites in India?&nbsp; I&#39;d love to hear about it sometime.&nbsp; Which musems are you going to on this trip?<br /><br />It would be great to have an Academic Astorians get-together.&nbsp; If you guys are going to the EATs outing, maybe I&#39;ll meet you there?

				Yes, we should definitely have spectators, who watch silently as the cooking happens.&nbsp; <br /><br />And I volunteer to be a judge.&nbsp; In the presence of the likes of Jonathan and Harlan, my cooking would simply not hold water (unless I poached it.&nbsp; &nbsp;:lol: Sorry, I tried).&nbsp; <br /><br />Presentation/originality/artistic appeal should totally be a huge factor, as I have seen it decide the outcome of an Iron Chef competition even when the contestants were tied in the other categories.&nbsp; <br /><br />And JustRachel, there is definitely a call for overdramatic music.&nbsp; &quot;If memory serves&quot; they used music from Backdraft on the original Iron Chef.&nbsp;

				I&#39;m wondering how we do this. Do we find some random way to divide ourselves up into two teams? Do we somehow pick two teams? Do we divide ourselves by who lives above/below Astoria blvd or 30th ave? <br /><br />My initial thought was just to somehow elect &quot;head chefs&quot; and let them pick their own teams, but I think this should be more about letting everyone participate than culinary excellence a la 3rd grade gym. We could have a meetup, pull numbers out of a hat and separate into teams accordingly. If we notice that all the people who are know for their cooking abilities are on one team and all of us other poor schlubs are on the other, we could trade a few people. That&#39;s one thought. any other ideas?<br /><br />(Other things to think about - what is an acceptable level of prep? Does everything have to be done from scratch?)<br /><br /><br /><br />

What is too technical? Guidelines for cooking or deciding how we will pick teams? We have to decide all of this stuff eventually ... and maybe not everyone wants to be involved in the discussion, but deciding it now means no last minute &quot;THEY pre-chopped all their veggies!!! They cheated! We are SO not neighbors anymore! TEAM A IS BOYCOTTING ASTORIA!!!&quot; Which can really spoil the fun. <br /><br />Talking about things now and thinking them through means less stress and more fun later. Anyway, I think planning is fun :) I can move it to another thread if it is making it harder to have a focused conversation.<br /><br />Are we serious about submitting this to foodnetwork? If so, I think we need to give it a little more time and wait for more pieces of the puzzle to come together before we pick a date. We already have a window between Jonathan&#39;s remodeling and Anzubird&#39;s trip to India to give us some focus.

				I think the amount of talking we&#39;re doing now is fine.&nbsp; I think Jonathan mentioned towards the end of September for the date if we&#39;re going to use his kitchen, so what else can we do until then?&nbsp; If we are going to do it, we do need to plan and figure out how we&#39;re going to approach it.&nbsp; I think the ultimate goal for all of us is just to have fun - but we do have to figure out things like who will be on what cooking team (I like the idea of picking names out of a hat), what can be pre-prepped, etc.&nbsp; If one side wastes 15 minutes on a brunoise for the pretty confetti while the other team did it ahead of time, what&#39;s fair or fun about that?&nbsp; &nbsp;:-P<br /><br />As for the other goal, well, my understanding is that we want to have a video we can submit to the food network as part of their How Do You Iron Chef (http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/show_ia/text/0,1976,FOOD_16696_32926,00.html) mini contest.&nbsp; But ultimately even if that doesn&#39;t work out, I still think it would be a lot of fun to have our own Iron Chef.

				So are we going more with the style of the Japanese version, or Iron Chef America?&nbsp; If we&#39;re going with Iron Chef America, somebody has to be Alton.&nbsp; And also, if it&#39;s Iron Chef America, Telly has to do a whole tumbling pass with flips and summersaults, and all that stuff.

				Right, nevermind then.&nbsp; I&#39;m out.&nbsp; The teams and brunoise planning is too much like school - which I hate.&nbsp; You folks enjoy!&nbsp; I look forward to seeing the tape.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-D

				Well, now, I&#39;m not saying there has to be or should be brunoise - I purposefully picked an extreme example.&nbsp; And I don&#39;t think anything I&#39;ve said is set in stone.&nbsp; What would you like to see, JD?&nbsp; I&#39;m asking seriously, not flippantly.

				lanseaux, I know you were using brunoise as an example; so was I.&nbsp; My point was that what I was hoping would be a light, informal cooking gathering began to sound more like a real Food Network-type production.&nbsp; I just had in mind playing around with surprise ingredients and seeing what folks can put together in an hour, and then eating it.&nbsp; I really didn&#39;t mean to put a weird vibe on this whole thing, it&#39;s just no longer my cup of tea.&nbsp; There is no way for everyone to agree on everything, so I&#39;ve just made the decision not to participate.&nbsp; Perhaps I will simply spectate.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-D
