				Hi all,<br />I just moved to Astoria from Greenpoint and Im looking for some bar reccomendations. I live off 30th ave and most of the bars here are either the greek cafe&#39;s or a few hole-in-the wall irish bars. I know about the beer garden, but other than that I havent really found a cool place where I can meet young cool people.<br />Thanks!<br />

				You might like Rapture on 28th ave. (around...33rd?&nbsp; 34th? st)<br /><br />Or if you&#39;re not totally against Irish bars, the Irish Rover is nice.&nbsp; 28th ave. at 38th st.

				I would agree with GFBoy...&nbsp; the rover is a good place.&nbsp; Be fore-warned tho, when they get to know you a little, the buy-back ratio is 2:1.&nbsp; &nbsp;Very dangerous if you hate leaving with coasters still on the bar.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;McCanns on Ditmars and 36th-ish is good, tho I&#39;ve heard it described on here as having a frat atmosphere.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#39;t agree.&nbsp; &nbsp;The food there is really good and the staff is top notch.&nbsp; &nbsp;And you can take your buy-backs home with you to spend there another night.&nbsp; (not the 2:1 the Rover has, but still a nice option)<br /><br />Sunswick on 35th and 35th has a nice selection too.&nbsp; &nbsp;24 taps.<br /><br />I still think the Pit Stop on McGuinness still has the best juke box in Queens tho and the Turkey&#39;s Nest has the most lopsided floor in Queens.&nbsp; It&#39;s rivaled only by the Subway Inn in Manh.<br /><br />Happy Drinking.<br /><br />(nothing wrong with meeting us cool old farts either)<br /><br />P.S.&nbsp; Welcome to the Board

				&nbsp;30th ave is pretty much irish bars and greek cafes, but....<br /><br />the quays on 30th ave and 45th st. fun bar, good service, they have alot of good bands on the jukebox(lucero!), 3rd round buyback always. its shane macgowan&#39;s choice afterparty spot, so its got that drunk&#39;s stamp of approval.

				Something tells me that you were looking for options other than Irish bars....if that&#39;s the case than I reccommend Sparrow on 24th avenue across from the BeerGarden...it&#39;s more of an artistic crowd. You may like Rapture, I wasn&#39;t really into it but it has a different vibe as well.&nbsp; I also hear Hell Gate Social is pretty fun. Any opinions about that???<br /><br />Hope I helped.<br /><br />N

				Hell&#39;s Gate Social is a cool space- but it is a hike unless you live over there. <br /><br />Dive bars, especially Irish ones are my thing- so Irish Rover and the Quays- (though the Quays isn&#39;t really a dive bar) get my vote for cool bars. <br /><br />&nbsp;I am personally not a big fan of the Sparrow myself- but thats just my opinion. I have many friends who live here and love it. I would definitely say that it would be a more of a Green Point/Williamsburg type of bar than any of the others in Astoria.

				Hellgate Social is wonderful, I agree that it would be better if it were closer to the train (especially with the weather getting chilly).&nbsp; Is there a bus that goes over there?

				Hellgate Social is on Astoria Boulevard just West of 21st Street.&nbsp; It&#39;s a great space and the owners are very accomodating.&nbsp; I just wish it was closer to the subway line.

				What about for singles? Ive been living in Astoria for nearly 2 years but only recently became single, and having a hard time finding a good place. McCahn&#39;s as well as most of the broadway bars have pretty bad ratios (if your a dude) Never been the the HellGate Social, but that sounds like the kind of place I&#39;d be looking for. Any other suggestions?
