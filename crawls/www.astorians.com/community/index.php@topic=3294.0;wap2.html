			Someone here must know how to patch together a HDR picture in PSCS. I know CS2 has a automated function for it, but alas I only have cs1. <br /><br />I know the part where I have 3 pictures of different exposures.. Then I put them in to the same workspace as 3 layers. But how do I get each layer to work independently?<br /><br />Thanks.<br />

			Sorry - what is HDR? I know Photoshop pretty well, so I could probably help you if I understood your question a bit more.

			It&#39;s &quot;High Dynamic Range.&quot;&nbsp; I haven&#39;t tried it yet, but from what I can tell, all of the sites online only refer to CS2 as being able to easily handle it - sorry.

			Wasabism..HDR stands for high dynamic range. When you take a picture at sunset you can see the sky clearly, the person infront of you clearly, and the building in the distance clearly. When you take a picture of said sunset you see the Sky clearly but the ground and buildings are just blacked out. When you take a picture it has a low dynamic range, It&#39;s either going show higlights or shadows but not both. <br /><br />HDR overcomes this problem by taking 3 or more exposures, and combining the best parts of each one.. Check this picture out.. It&#39;s not mine but it will give you an idea of what I am talking about..http://www.flickr.com/photos/3rdfoundation/163571010/<br /><br />CS2 has a HDR Macro. You open 3 pics and it does the combining part for you.

			Ah okay. I am not really a photographer - just manipulate what other people photograph.<br /><br />If you don&#39;t have CS2, then yeah, it seems to me at first glance that you would need to create three layers and then manually change the brightness/contrast and perhaps even hue and saturation. I&#39;d probably also play around with the blend mode and opacity. I am at work, so I can&#39;t really take too much time to think about it, but it doesn&#39;t seem like it would be that difficult to do - it would just take extra time rather than having an automatic function... This also seems reminiscent of creating a panorama image out of three or more separate images, so I would think that you could use similar steps to create a HDR image.<br /><br />Maybe Zip has some good suggestions. He seems quite handy with Photoshop (Zip - love your website btw :)).
