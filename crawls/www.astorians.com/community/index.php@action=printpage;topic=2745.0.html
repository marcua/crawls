				You know when you&#39;re having a really crappy day, or you&#39;re trying to pump yourself up to do something that sucks, do you ever turn on a particular song to get your head in the right place?&nbsp; <br /><br />What are your &quot;feel-good&quot; songs?<br /><br />Mine include &quot;Copacabana,&quot; &quot;Something Like That,&quot; &quot;Summer of &#39;69,&quot; &quot;Slide,&quot; a few others, some too embarrassing to mention.&nbsp; &nbsp;:oops:<br /><br />Anyone?<br /><br />Oh yeah, &quot;Penny Lane.&quot;&nbsp; Probably my favorite song EVER!!!

				lanseaux-- i was a dj on college radio, and i had the opportunity to interview Ani Cordero on my show in 2002....the had come out with &quot;Cordero perdido en la cuidad&quot;.&nbsp; i moved to nyc for grad school in fall 2003 and finally got to meet them for their second album &quot;Somos Cordero&quot; ...didnt get to catch &quot;Bee and Flower&quot;. <br /><br />she&#39;s now doing some brief work as drummer in Pistolera and stuff. <br /><br />it&#39;s too bad they keep switching around band members. well... they lost their keyboardist to interpol.... which is not a bad thing, but it changed their muisical style a lot... and it&#39;s a good thing that crazy drummer is still there. <br /><br />but Ani is just the sweetest person. <br /><br />they put on REALLY fun shows. the last show in March 2006, i danced with one of her racoon people, they pulled me up on stage for &quot;Vamos Nenas&quot; ....!!! what an honor! and i won a monkey. it was a blast. (yes, i said raccoon people, and i DID win a monkey)<br /><br />Cordero is soooooooooooooo much fun.&nbsp; you will not be disappointed. <br /><br />www.corderomusic.com<br /><br />edited to add.... duh! the band in my sig line! <br /><br />the exit!!! awesome rockin NYC band. the guitarist, ben, was raised in Queens (i dont think Astoria) they practiced and had a studio in DUMBO for a couple years. then i guess ben decided to move to Astoria this past year............<br /><br />well, some bastard stole their equipment from their van here in Astoria! arrrrrrrgh!!! now they have no s___ and cannot tour. super sad about that.&nbsp; <br /><br />but the song that is fun to sing along to is: &quot;143&quot;<br /><br />b/c the chorus goes <br /><br />&quot;the sun will rise in Queens and i will shine.....&quot; it&#39;s really fun to sing along to that in the morning when sometimes you dont feel like walking up the subway stairs. or it&#39;s really nice to listen to the song coming back from work when the sun is setting.....<br /><br />ahhh, back home again....<br /><br />&quot;the sun will rise in Queens and i will shine...shine on, YEAH!&quot;&nbsp; the exit ( www.theexitrock.com (http://www.theexitrock.com) )

				Oh man, I have TOO many songs that I love. Some are actually good, and some, even I recognize that they&#39;re just...well...embarassing. Its bad enough that I don&#39;t share my iTunes Library with my roommate because I will most definitely lose any cred that I might still have. That said, here&#39;s a few songs that I LOVE and will NEVER get sick of, and I don&#39;t care if anyone hates me for it:<br /><br />Carl Carlton - She&#39;s a Bad Mamma Jamma (or is it Mama Jama? Whatever.)<br />The Ceasars - Jerk It Out (hehe)<br />The Coasters - If You Wanna Be Happy (have you ever listened to the lyrics of this song? Boys - marry an ugly chick!)<br />Def Leppard - Rock of Ages (but really, pretty much anything by them)<br />Foo Fighters - Times Like These (original or acoustic)<br />George Michael - Freedom &#39;90<br />INXS - New Sensation<br />Kelly Clarkson - Gone (<strong>not</strong> Since You Been Gone)<br />No Doubt - Just a Girl<br />Pink - U &amp; Ur Hand (its on her new CD, which is actually really good if you&#39;re into poppy stuff - plus she&#39;s a total smartass which I love)<br />Tom Petty - American Girl<br />TLC - Hat 2 Da Back (LOVE THIS)<br /><br />That, my friends, was just a teeny-tiny selection of things that I&#39;ve marked as 5 Stars in iTunes. I won&#39;t even look at the 4 star stuff right now. Ha!

				I recently rediscovered Aztec Camera. Great 80&#39;s pop. That ususally makes me feel good. <br /><br />I&#39;ve also got a friend in a band in England called The Tiny Dancers (bad name, I know, but the record company stuck them with it.) but they play the most happy songs ever. Myspace.com/tinydancers if you want to hear them.<br /><br />I also like hippie music from the 60&#39;s. &quot;Goin&#39; up the country&quot; and stuff like that. Cream, Buffalo Springfield, Animals.

				Okay, well, what I consider a &quot;feel good&quot; tune might not be universally recognized as such ... but here are some that may work for people other than myself ...<br /><br />&quot;I Could Be Happy&quot; - Altered Images<br />&quot;Magician Man&quot; - The Pipettes<br />&quot;You are the Generation that Bought More Shoes and You Get What You Deserve&quot; - Johnny Boy (<em>yes, she actually fits that in the chorus ... heh</em>)<br />&quot;Hey Now Now&quot; - The Cloud Room<br />&quot;Just Passing Through&quot; - Augie March<br />&quot;Mr E&#39;s Beautiful Blues&quot; - Eels<br />&quot;Happy Kid&quot; - Nada Surf<br />&quot;A Praise Chorus&quot; - Jimmy Eat World<br />&quot;Monkey Gone to Heaven&quot; - Pixies<br />&quot;Flagpole Sitta&quot; - Harvey Danger<br />&quot;Angel Baby&quot; - Rosie and the Originals<br />&quot;Here Comes my Baby&quot; - Cat Stevens (<em>don&#39;t laugh ...</em>)<br />&quot;Dance This Mess Around&quot; or &quot;52 Girls&quot; - B-52s<br />&quot;Family Entertainment&quot; - The Undertones<br />&quot;I&#39;ll Melt With You&quot; - Modern English (<em>how can you <strong>not</strong> feel good after hearing this song??</em>)<br /><br />(as for Aztec Camera, &quot;Oblivious&quot; is a cute little tune.)

				DC - Oblivious is still my favorite Aztec Camera song.<br />Anything by the Pixies is great, though I still think &quot;Dig for fire&quot; is the best.<br />How about &quot;Save it for later&quot; by the English Beat, or &quot;Love Plus One&quot; by Haircut One Hundred?<br />Harvey Danger is great.&nbsp; They didn&#39;t seem to do much after Flagpole Sitta though.&nbsp; Nada Surf is back and still great, though they seemed destined to be a one-hit-wonder after &quot;Popular&quot;.&nbsp; Cat Stevens was good - but he&#39;s been so crazy lately.&nbsp; I loved &quot;Peace Train&quot; and the 10,000 maniacs cover of it.&nbsp; <br />Did you hear B-52&#39;s are supposed to be touring this Summer?&nbsp; I think they&#39;re coming to NYC in August (Jones Beach?) - &quot;Love Shack&quot; and &quot;My Own Private Idaho&quot;, as well as just about anything they&#39;ve done is amazing.<br /><br />

				Oh, yeah, gotta love the B-52s, you&#39;re right, they&#39;re @ Asser Levy Park, August 10th, bad night for me, unfortunately, but I&#39;d love to see them. (Musn&#39;t forget &quot;Rock Lobster&quot; either ... heh.)<br /><br />I had &quot;Dig for Fire&quot; down first, but thought that might be too morose ... I knew I liked you mcd :) And was disappointed overall by Harvey Danger, though I like their cover of &quot;Save It for Later,&quot; otherwise though, Sitta is about it for them -- I know when that comes up on my playlist it&#39;s going to be a good day.<br /><br />It&#39;s typical of me (I&#39;m not purposely contrary, really, I&#39;m not ...), but &quot;Popular&quot; is my least favorite Nada Surf song, more a fan of the one I listed below, &quot;Blonde on Blonde,&quot; &quot;Inside of Love,&quot; and &quot;Always Love,&quot; and songs of that ilk from them. Find them to be pretty good overall, prettyish-pop tunes are always a fave. <br /><br />&quot;Mr. November&quot; by The National is also good, though, really, it&#39;s rather subversive (but that doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t feel good though, right?) ;)

				Some things that have been popping into my head (and onto my iPod) lately, when in the mood for something feel-good:<br /><br />Tripping Daisy&#39;s &quot;I Got a Girl&quot; (my great summer song from &#39;95)<br />&quot;Let&#39;s Groove,&quot; by Earth Wind &amp; Fire <br />&quot;Head Over Heels&quot; by the Go-Gos<br />and Cassandra Wilson&#39;s version of &quot;The Weight&quot;<br /><br />oh--and because I was an 80s kid, I have to say that the Thompson Twins&#39; &quot;Hold Me Now&quot; always makes me smile, despite it&#39;s becoming a lite-FM staple.<br />

				I love Hold Me Now - I was singing along at the Duane Reade up on Ditmars when I was getting a Diet Coke, without realizing it, and got a strange look from a 20 something.&nbsp; It&#39;s just one of those songs that even as background music in a store makes you want to sing along.<br /><br />Istanbul was good, but on that album, Birdhouse in your soul was better!

				Actually, this is kind of related - I&#39;ve been here about a year and usually do my grocery shopping at Best Yet on 37th just above 20th ave - its never crowded, prices are good, etc. But this week when I was in there, I noticed something else - I am ALWAYS singing along to whatever music is playing in there. They play great music ALL the time! I think it&#39;s a combination of sattelite radio and employees putting CDs in, because sometimes it seems to be themed (all 80s music, 60s doo-wop), but a couple times ago it was all Bee-Gees, and once it was all U2.<br /><br />Aw, that makes me miss the days when I worked in the bookstore with the tape deck in the back - it hooked up to the PA system, and we&#39;d make mix tapes to listen to while working.

				Shriekback&#39;s lyrics are a bit dark for a feel-good song, but it&#39;s always been one of my all-time favorites.&nbsp; They have a lot of very moody and dark material, and some bouncier stuff as well (they do some KC and the Sunshine band covers on Go Bang - I loved them, though a lot of their hardcore fan base did not).<br />Duluoz Cats - I love Moby and Public Enemy and haven&#39;t heard that one - I will check it out!&nbsp; Most anything by Moby is good, at least to me.&nbsp; &quot;First Cool Hive&quot; and &quot;Feeling So Real&quot; both belong on this list of feel-good songs.

				Midnight Oil was incredible in the 80s and 90s, so much wonderful music, then they seem to have lost their edge a bit in the late 90s - more of a country rock sound.&nbsp; I loved Diesel and Dust, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 and Blue Sky Mining, Head Injuries and even Earth, Sun and Moon, but their last one didn&#39;t do much for me.&nbsp;

				me and julio-- definitely a classic feel good song. that was the first &quot;pop&quot; song i ever strummed out after years as a &#39;serious&#39; classical guitarist<br /><br />in the summertime, i really like Erykah Badu&#39;s &quot;LOVE OF MY LIFE (an ode to hip hop)&quot; featuring common on the stereo with the windows open... like all good things, it starts out mellow until cresting into an excellent and feel-good chorus<br /><br />&quot;oooh you know you rock my world (love of my life)<br />you be boy and i&#39;ll be girl (love of my life) and<br />we don&#39;t stop until the break of dawn.&quot;<br /><br />(http://ameblo.jp/user_images/ea/9b/10001081279_s.jpg)

				The Spree are very bouncy and upbeat.&nbsp; Have you caught them live yet?&nbsp; It&#39;s an intense and moving experience (though most of their songs sound fairly similiar).&nbsp; Death Cab is also a lot of fun - they have some happy songs too - &quot;Soul Meets Body&quot; or maybe even &quot;Sound of Settling&quot;?<br />What about Rilo Kiley (or Jenny Lewis on her own with Watson Twins?) - &quot;More Adventurous&quot; or &quot;Melt Your Heart&quot;<br />Electric Six - &quot;Dance Commander&quot;<br />Stars - &quot;Elevator Love Letter&quot; and &quot;Set Yourself on Fire&quot;<br />Almost anything by St. Etienne (who can frown when Sarah Cracknell is singing?)

				Quirky they are, but Jenny&#39;s voice makes me happy, even if the song is slow.&nbsp; &nbsp;I still think some of their songs would classify as &quot;feel good&quot; - maybe &quot;The Good That Won&#39;t Come Out&quot; or even &quot;The Execution of All Things&quot; (despite the title?)&nbsp; Maybe their songs are too quirky or too slow paced ...&nbsp; but they do make me happy and make me feel good&nbsp; :-)

				Excuse me, but I love Rod&#39;s standards.&nbsp; His duet with Bette Midler on <em>Manhattan</em> is most enjoyable.&nbsp; They&#39;re fun, they&#39;re selling well, and the man puts on one hell of a concert. When I saw him last August at the Greek Theater in LA, the best part of his show was the second half when he busted out a tux and went to town on those standards.&nbsp; The whole audience was singing along. I have to wonder how many of those people, myself included, would know those songs without him. I certainly wouldn&#39;t.&nbsp; He made them new again, and accessible to a wider audience.&nbsp; Regardless of being an avid fan, I can&#39;t fault him for enjoying success from those old songs. Anyway, he must be doing something right if he&#39;s still a hit after 30-some years. Plus, he&#39;s British.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-D

When I saw him last August at the Greek Theater in LA, the best part of his show was the second half when he busted out a tux and went to town on those standards.&nbsp; The whole audience was singing along. I have to wonder how many of those people, myself included, would know those songs without him. I certainly wouldn&#39;t.&nbsp; He made them new again, and accessible to a wider audience.&nbsp; Regardless of being an avid fan, I can&#39;t fault him for enjoying success from those old songs. Anyway, he must be doing something right if he&#39;s still a hit after 30-some years. Plus, he&#39;s British.&nbsp;&nbsp; :-D <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />OK.&nbsp; I&#39;ll agree that it&#39;s good he&#39;s reintroducing many of these songs.&nbsp; But I also question how many people who listen to Rod will seek out the original recordings of those songs.&nbsp; I&#39;m somewhat skeptical.&nbsp; And I&#39;ll also disagree with Bet.&nbsp; ew.&nbsp; Again, just one man&#39;s opinion.<br /><br />But if you want some feel good standards, you GOTSTA check out some Louis Prima.&nbsp; Or even better, Louis Armstrong.&nbsp; Either Louis will cure what ails ya.

				Of course, after dissing lyrics, I leave the house and what should pop up on my fauxPod but Eleanor Rigby, thus convincingly disproving my argument. Oh well. This said, I still maintain that simpler emotions like &quot;feel-good&quot; can be communicated very well without lyrics, and that many of my favorite song use lyrics as an instrument rather than poetry...

				I do love you flooz!!&nbsp; You are amazing!<br />Cloudcookooland was great, some of their other albums are amazing as well - Sense and Dizzy Heights especially.&nbsp; I don&#39;t think they made a bad album.<br />I still haven&#39;t caught Morrisey live yet - have you checked out his new album?&nbsp; I think he may tour with it - he did with his last one (which was wonderful!)

				I guess I should read the whole thread and maybe I&#39;ll be enlightened, but I&#39;m mystified why a thread called &quot;Feel-Good songs&quot; would reference the Smiths and Leonard Cohen.<br /><br />I find fairly reliable doses of feel-good from The New Pornographers (power-pop), The Heavy Blinkers (harmony-rich orchestrated pop) and ELO (who recently had some of their best albums remastered).&nbsp; The self-titled 1982 album from Todd Rundgren&#39;s band Utopia has lots of feel-good on it, too.&nbsp; And certain XTC songs.

				Oops!&nbsp;&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; Actually, though, sometimes when I&#39;m depressed The Smiths really do cheer me up.&nbsp; Not sure why - some of the later music (thinking specifically Strangeways) is actually quite cheerful to me (A rush and a push, Stop me if you think you&#39;ve heard this one, Unhappy birthday) even though the lyrics are anything but.&nbsp; Some of Morrissey&#39;s stuff also does that for me.&nbsp; Also Depeche Mode&#39;s Black Celebration and Violator (go figure).<br /><br />XTC and The Housemartins are both happy bands for me, but I can&#39;t even put them on when I&#39;m depressed - they&#39;re <em>too</em> feel-good.

				Cocteau Twins is another great band when you are feeling down. Though not all of there stuff is depressing. I love &quot;The Blue Bell Knoll&quot; and &quot;Heaven and Las Vegas&quot;. <br />If I had to pick a favorite band it would be a toss up between them and The Cure. There is lots of new stuff that I like, but for some reason I always seem to go back to listening to Cocteau Twins and the Cure.<br /><br />XTC - &quot;Dear God&quot; thats a brilliant song!

It always makes me relax.)<br />3. &quot;Razzle Dazzle Rose&quot; by Camera Obscura (A really perfect song)<br />4. &quot;Passenger Seat&quot; by Death Cab For Cutie (This one makes me miss my car)<br />5.

				Afternoon Delight is one of those songs that I never liked, but due to the show Arrested Development every time I hear it I laugh.&nbsp; It&#039;s like the Final Countdown, which also makes me laugh / smile every time I hear it now.
