				Anyone else watch this show?&nbsp; &nbsp;I think it&#039;s only show worth watching besides South Park.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Breaking Bad is not as consistantly good.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Next week is season finale.&nbsp; &nbsp;Hope they cut commercials down for it.

				I&#039;ve finally found a show worthy of viewing regularly besides sportsnews&amp;weather. I love Mad Men. Last week&#039;s episode was amazing, but I only started watching the series recently. After the season ends I&#039;ll have to rent the earlier seasons on DVD. <br /><br />JoeyC if you like Madmen and the pre-psychedelic 60&#039;s era you might enjoy the movie (although a musical comedy) &quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot;.<br /><br />On a side note -the few times I saw Jersey Shore I liked it and hated it at the same time. I heard a similar show is in the works where the setting will be Brighton Beach. Now THAT should be funny. Kinda like the Direct TV commercial. Can&#039;t wait!

				Yeah, he was so cute in that movie with his gap-toothed smile. And he was such a crooner-ha! <br /><br />Jon Hamm isn&#039;t so bad looking either!<br />

				Jon Hamm is great, and makes the show as good as it is. Whole cast is good,not a stiff in the bunch.&nbsp; I like that is it different, you don&#039;t see things coming.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Also seeing all new faces in a show is something good.&nbsp; I bet many who are getting first big break on Mad Men go on to big carreers.&nbsp;

You&#039;re right that you don&#039;t see things coming, definitely keeps one guessing. I&#039;m wondering what the future holds for some characters from 1964 on, such as buttoned-up Peggy with her new love who&#039;s a budding radical. What about control freak Betty Francis and her sweet, sad little daughter? Perhaps the younger males will all get drafted and go off to Vietnam (whoopee!) and the older ones will die before our very eyes of lung cancer/cirrhosis.<br /><br />I like the way the first half of last week&#039;s episode-the encounter with the heroin addict-tied into Draper&#039;s decision to drop cigarette advertising. Did you know this was based on a factual event in the advertising world?<br /><br />http://articles.latimes.com/1992-07-09/news/mn-2252_1_emerson-foote<br /><br />http://blogs.sj-r.com/offtheclock/index.php/archives/3162

				To me, Hamm has a bit of a 1960&#039;s Sean Connary look about him (I know, how dare i say that!)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He&#039;s doing movies that don&#039;t suit him so far.&nbsp; <br /><br />Couple of weeks ago he was on Jimmy Fallon. I think he gave his agent a heart attack.&nbsp; Fallon says &quot;I hear you are being considered for Superman role?&quot;&nbsp; and Hamm says he did not hear of it, but that he is probably &#039;Too Old&quot; :-o&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No actor should ever say that!<br /><br />I am not superman fan, but Hamm would be good as him, if done in dark way, not frivolous way.<br />The ex-wife actress is also great, as is the kid (daughter)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I like them, but still prefer when storyline sticks to stuff regarding&nbsp; the firm, although the scene with ex-girlrind junkie was great.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				I watched series fianl episode for season.&nbsp; &nbsp;Apparently, Don is&nbsp; creep, and a nutcase.&nbsp; &nbsp; Show was very good, loved the office stuff the most.&nbsp; &nbsp;I could do without the ex-wife, kids, and other outside stuff.&nbsp; Maybe next season opens with Don in straight jacket?&nbsp; &nbsp;
