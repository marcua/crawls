				How do you get to the Home Depot on Northern Blvd. via public transit?<br /><br />I think there is a subway near it?<br /><br />How about a bus?<br /><br />Due to the exotic nature of my home improvement needs, the Manhattan store just won't cut it.<br /><br /><br />thanks in advance,<br />jayme

				I think you take the 7 out to Sunnyside, then catch a bus ... it's quite a walk.<br /><br />but why not call the store, just to be sure?

				One way is to walk down to Steinway St. and Ditmars (or somewhere where there is a bus) and take the bus all the way on the Steinway St bus... Went to David's Bridal out there that way a year or two ago, and it seems like we wound up closeby to Home Depot.

				Take the r train to Northern Blvd and get off there. You have to walk a few blocks but it isn't that far away. We do this when we need to go to Best Yet, target, or anything else near there.<br /><br />The home depot there looks like a big warehouse so it is kind of intimidating, but you just gotta go for it. :)

				Thanks for the directions. &nbsp;I'm going to try out the Northern Blvd route -- which, I might add, sounds like it's in close proximity to the new Michaels.<br /><br />Crafts aaaaaaand home improvements in one big trip.<br /><br />Will report back.<br /><br />cheers,<br />jayme

				I know this is quite awhile since the original question, but the Q66 bus stops right on Northern Blvd, right in front of Home Depot. It runs along 35th avenue from 21st street to just past Steinway Street, so you can connect to it from the N (36th ave stop) R (steinway) or several buses which run along 21st street, 31st street or steinway street.
