				http://www.ifccenter.com/index<br /><br />for your possible interest<br />Crossed the river and saw a fairly unusual film project. While a Satire, it rarely seemed funny due to the subject. It is not very deep, but it does well enough with the bizarre concept of a history of what might have happened after the South won the civil war.<br />(Though I think the US does not recognize where we have moved forward; ours is more to be a melting pot than almost any country you could name.)<br />&nbsp;:?<br /><br />(it starts with a nice quote of<br />If you want to tell people the truth, make them laugh; otherwise they&#39;ll kill you)<br /><br />It might make you think of how history is told and written by the victors, how the govt and media lead your understanding, what freedoms and advances we take for granted.<br />I would not make a point to have others see this, but if it ends up on cable or DVD you might to catch at least the last 30 minutes and the first 15 minutes.<br /><br />Nice twist how Senator Kennedy is the Yankee abolitionist loving candidate running as a Republican. (Not to mention that he is a Catholic. The states expand their persecution and oppression. And while President Washington is held in regard, President Jefferson Davis has a mixed legacy.)<br /><br />Hear how the kids finish pledging to the flag of the C.S.A<br />(I was raised that there was nothing truly patriotic in reciting a govt fed pledge)<br /><br />Artists flee for free countries. Wondering how the oppresive states are supposed to have maintained advances in science (but look at China and other countries today).<br /><br />&quot;He did not have sex with that woman.&quot;<br />I would say the film is disturbing but hilarious is a stretch.<br />(I was going to say can you imagine 1984 as a comedy but then there was Brazil to have been titled &quot;1984 1/2&quot;)<br /><br />If you stay for the end, it finishes with some pieces of sad actual American cultural history.<br />And we can still root for the Redskins in football. (OK all you DC fans.) (One of the restaurants named, I remember from when I was a kid.)<br /><br /><br />&quot;CSA: The Confederate States of America <br />&nbsp; <br />Reviewed by Owen Gleiberman<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&#39;AMERICA&#39; THE BEAUTIFUL A sly, scary look at a world without a land of the free<br />&nbsp;<br />If you want to know whether you can still laugh while your mouth is dropping open in shock, then you won&#39;t want to miss the disturbingly hilarious mock documentary C.S.A.: The Confederate States of America. It&#39;s a fearless and brilliant racial-historical satire, done in a meticulous re-creation of the Ken Burns mode, that chronicles the last 150 years of America as if the South had won the Civil War. That&#39;s right: Jefferson Davis gets elected president, Lincoln escapes in blackface with the aid of Harriet Tubman (&#39;&#39;We both n-----s now, Mr. President!&#39;&#39;), and slavery is established throughout the land. The writer-director, Kevin Willmott, works with a scandalous daring matched by his dexterous manipulation of archival reality. He mixes photographs and films, historical figures actual and fake, plus talking heads and sick-joke racist commercials until fact and fiction eerily merge.<br /><br />A snippet from a D.W. Griffith film depicting Lincoln&#39;s capture is tastelessly funny, but later, an &#39;&#39;actual&#39;&#39; 1905 clip of the forgotten former president has a haunting plausibility. C.S.A., like Philip Roth&#39;s The Plot Against America, is a dense counterhistory that ingeniously undermines your disbelief. As the Confederate States turns into a domesticated haven of white supremacy, even signing a truce with Hitler during World War II, the movie gets you to think, Could this actually have happened? The audacious upshot of C.S.A. is that in a place with the still-thriving racial demons of America, it sort of did.<br />&nbsp;<br />-Entertainment Weekly
