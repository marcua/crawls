				I hope you’ve already voted! <br />&nbsp;<br />Since you strike me as someone who is civically engaged, why not continue with a phone call to Senators Gillibrand and Schumer about amendments to the FAA Reauthorization Bill (H.R. 636) that would reduce helicopter noise over Astoria? <br />&nbsp;<br />Does helicopter noise in Astoria affect your quality of life?<br />Do helicopters affect your enjoyment of time outside, perhaps at Astoria Park?<br />Do they keep you up late at night and then wake you early in the morning?<br />Most importantly, do you want to do something about it?<br />&nbsp;<br />Now is your chance! And all it takes is a quick phone call or email today. <br />&nbsp;<br />U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) has authored two amendments to the FAA reauthorization bill before the Senate - and the implementation of both would invite community input regarding helicopter routes and help to reduce helicopter noise over Astoria.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />Please call Senator Gillibrand’s and Senator Schumer’s offices today and express support for Senator Gillibrand’s Amendments #3605 and #3554 <br />See the details below! <br />&nbsp;<br />Both calls would take less than 10 minutes combined!<br />Gillibrand’s Office phone number: (202)224-4451<br />Schumer’s Office phone number: (202) 224-6542<br />&nbsp;<br />If you feel more comfortable writing a note:<br />https://www.schumer.senate.gov/contact/email-chuck (https://www.schumer.senate.gov/contact/email-chuck)<br />http://www.gillibrand.senate.gov/contact/ (http://www.gillibrand.senate.gov/contact/)<br />&nbsp;<br />Information:<br />Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) Amendment #3605<br />This amendment calls for a final FAA rule in three years that creates a requirement that all existing aircraft must be retrofitted to comply with stage 3 noise levels (an international standard); any helicopters not in compliance with stage 3 noise levels by December 2024 must be retired. Government and medical helicopters are exempt.<br />This amendment would help to reduce the noise impacts of a large number of helicopters that fly the THROGS helicopter route over Queens, including Astoria. <br /><br /><br />Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) Amendment #3554<br />This amendment calls for establishment of a process within one year to determine whether minimum altitude requirements for helicopter routes over populated areas can be safely set to reduce noise effects on communities and whether existing routes should be modified, restricted, or eliminated due to excessive noise. The FAA would establish a process to consult with politicians and communities and to evaluate specific helicopter routes to reduce noise.<br />Under this amendment, communities will get input into existing routes and have a stronger voice in rulemaking. This could lead to a reduction in helicopter noise, which negatively affects the health of those on the ground.<br />Right now helicopters overfly Astoria at 1,500-2,000 feet with no speed restrictions. Helicopter operators say they are “Flying Neighborly”, but they operate their rotorcraft at speeds higher than manufacturers recommend for Fly Neighborly operations. Fast flights at low altitudes result in excessive noise.<br />Emergency operations and situations would not be impacted - medical evacuation and police helicopter operations would be understandably excluded.<br />Let me know if you have any questions!<br />&nbsp;

				I for one have never been bothered or even noticed abnormal amounts of helicopter traffic around Astoria. Maybe Gillibrand should lug around a helicopter as a form of protest for the rest of the semester.

				I guess it depends on where in Astoria you live, because when I lived on Ditmars and 35th Street, the helicopter noise was crazy.&nbsp; It would wake me up in the morning a few times a week.&nbsp; It was so annoying.&nbsp; Now we are on 28th Street and 24th Avenue and I rarely hear a helicopter.&nbsp; What a relief.

				I can&#039;t recall choppers having been a problem. I used to live around Ditmars/Steinway, and never had a problem. Don&#039;t have a problem now either.<br /><br />If there is one thing that is a problem though it&#039;s drivers leaning on their horns. Even the slightest temporary congestion and it&#039;s a zoo outside. For those of use who work at home part of the time this is a real nuisance I think. Far worse than the occasional chopper, to me at least.

				I think the experience of helicopter noise is dependent on where you are, but if you happen to be under them, it&#039;s definitely a nuisance. I suspect that part of the problem is that helicopters fly such specific routes that it&#039;s always the same streets/houses affected. We live right beneath the flight path and during the summer the helicopter traffic is incessant, especially on Fridays and Sundays, to such a degree that it can be hard to have a conversation in our backyard. I can tolerate train noise, airplane noise, power plant noise, and sewage treatment plant smells, since all of those are broadly beneficial public goods. It&#039;s a heck of a lot harder to tolerate a noisome chopper that&#039;s whisking a handful of oligarchs off to their Hamptons getaway........ <br /><br /><br />All of these regulations seem perfectly sensible and I&#039;ve contacted both of the senators in support!

				Nsutaria,<br /><br />Thank you for the posting and all the work you are doing with the helicopter noise. <br /><br />Like dawnlovesthierry, I live on 35th Street and the helicopter noise is terrible. It is one right after the other. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been contacting 311, the Assemblywoman, Chuck Shumer and K. Gillibrand&nbsp; to try and have these helicopters rerouted. <br /><br />One of my neighbors spoke to Paul Vallone and he said the pilots are suppose fly over the water on their way back from the Hamptons but cut over Astoria as a short cut.<br /><br />I implore everybody on this board (even if you don&#039;t hear them) to help out your fellow Astoria residents and have these helicopters take the route they&#039;re suppose to take.<br /><br />Thank you for your time!

				Due to the relatively low altitude that these helicopters fly, their noise radiation patterns are narrow but intense. Enough to rattle windows of houses directly below them and loud enough to interfere with normal conversation.

				I&#039;ve been doing some research and there are people trying to curb the noise.&nbsp; If you have time check out this report some Astoria residents put out:<br /><br />https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3fzqVoq00xGdUdwRW1FMFptODg/view?pref=2&amp;pli=1<br /><br />For some reason, these helicopters can&#039;t take another route, preferably over the East River.<br /><br />For our neighbors with Twitter, can you please send a tweet to the following mentioning the Astoria Helicopter Noise:<br /><br />@SenGillibrand<br /><br />@SenSchumer<br /><br />Thank you for your help<br />

				<br />Hello All,<br /><br /><br />It depends on where you live in Astoria. Some are not affected by the flight path.<br />We are talking here of commercial/ charter helicopters and seaplanes mostly flying to the Hamptons.<br />Since 2013 or so there has been a huge uptick in the number of commercial/ charter helicopter and seaplane flights over Astoria.<br />For those under the flight path, 80% of what you are hearing are these.<br />Here&#039;s why:<br />In 2012, after many complaints from constituents on Long Island, Senator Chuck Schumer put pressure on the FAA to mandate that all commercial helicopter and seaplane flights to the Hamptons use the North Shore Route, that is, get there via the North Shore of Long Island. Previously heli/ seaplane air traffic was more dispersed getting there, with most going down the center of LI, but they had more options.<br />Now, with the new mandate, to get to the North Shore Route they fly over LIC, Astoria, LGA, Whitestone, etc. and then out to open water.<br />As a result ALL the traffic going out to the Hamptons is concentrated over us.<br />There is a coalition of residents from the affected areas banning together to put pressure on our elected officials and the FAA to address this issue.<br />I live directly under the flight path. On some mornings in the summer months there can 20+ an hour of low flying, loud helicopters and seaplanes starting at 7AM - they wake us up every morning. <br />One of our members built a website with a LIVE map and an easy to use complaint form to collect data about the problem to provide to elected officials and civic groups. <br />https://www.airnoisereport.com/complaints/new (https://www.airnoisereport.com/complaints/new)<br /><br /><br />The only other complaint website one could use is owned by the industry and the data is not available to the public.<br />311 only accepts complaints about Tour Helicopters. <br /><br /><br />Attached is an annotated map of the flight path over us (more or less) marked in red. <br />If any of you would like to join our group please PM me (I hope that&#039;s an option on this website)<br /><br /><br />Best,<br />Scott.

				Thank you for sharing these resources! Sure enough, our house lies right under one of the flight paths marked on your map, and we have the same experience you do as far as disruptive noise (especially on Fridays and Sundays during the summer).<br /><br /><br />And that is an amazing map tool - I can&#039;t wait to use it. I will absolutely make a habit of reporting nuisance aircraft, and I&#039;ll share this information with neighbors.<br /><br /><br />I would love to join your group and help out if I can - I will send you a message.

				I&#039;m glad this is finally picking up steam.&nbsp; These helicopters are really loud and chronic.<br /><br />I hope the other readers of this board will help with contacting Schumer. We&#039;re not asking the helicopters to go over your homes. We&#039;re asking that they fly over the river and then out to the Hamptons which is where they are suppose to fly. Think about it, if there is a malfunction, they will crash into houses.&nbsp; These pilots don&#039;t care.<br /><br />Please help your fellow Astorians!!! Every tweet or email will help.<br /><br />Thank you!!!

				Agreed!<br /><br /><br />If you get a chance check out the LIVE map of helicopter and seaplane traffic flying over our area right now and you can submit a complaint of any that bother you.<br />https://www.airnoisereport.com/complaints/new<br />We are trying to build a record of traffic and complaint patterns to present to elected officials and the FAA.<br /><br /><br />Regards.

				SM,<br /><br />That site is GREAT!!! I&#039;m using it now because the Hamptons crowd is getting a head start to the weekend.&nbsp; It&#039;s one right after the other right now.<br /><br />The only pol that has been receptive is Aravella Simotas. I shot her an email with the helicopter report. I&#039;ll shoot her another one and see if you can get Chuck to do something. Maybe your crew can send her an email as well.
