				That&#039;s really sad.&nbsp; :|<br /><br />I remember a couple of years back I was driving south on 34th street towards 31st avenue and I was about 50 feet from the intersection with the green light on my side when all of a sudden an SUV just barrels through the red light.&nbsp; I remember thinking how just two seconds later and I probably would&#039;ve died.<br /><br />It&#039;s scary.

				Terrible news, and tragic.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen cars barreling down 34th Street as well as the Avenues lately - how can folks drive like a lunatic on small narrow residential roads (where lots of kids and elderly live?)&nbsp;

				They just had a story on Channel 4 about this tragedy.&nbsp; I can&#039;t find it on their website, but I did find the NY 1 video<br /><br />http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/89035/queens-driver-accused-of-dwi--killing-two/Default.aspx<br /><br />If it couldn&#039;t get any worse: According to the report on News 4, the livery car driver was a single mother of 2 teenage daughters, who worked 2 jobs to support them.&nbsp; The passenger/fare was a 24-year-old resident from Astoria (they mentioned her name and even showed the front door of her apartment), who was coming back from Brooklyn.&nbsp; Her family had no comment.<br /><br />The driver of the other vehicle is from Long Island, I believe, and faces numerous charges, including vehicular manslaughter.&nbsp;

				Back in 2006 this mindless zombie thug, one Daryush Omar, was among the mob of 7 men who while attempting to steal a wallet outside a Chelsea club in May 2006 took the life of Thomas Whitney Jr. with a steel pipe beatdown.&#160; This weekend Mr. Omar, here in the US illegally, was driving his Range Rover with an ankle bracelet on!

				Sadly, I&#039;m not surprised. Although, drunk driving is the cause here, even &#039;straight&#039; drivers&nbsp; are plenty dangerous&nbsp; in the side streets&nbsp; of Astoria. I&nbsp; drive in Astoria, only when I am making my way to&nbsp; a bridge to get&nbsp; out of town. However, even as a&nbsp; driver, I have other &#039;loony tunes&#039; drivers&nbsp; who try to literally run you off&nbsp; the road even on a one way side street, trying to get in front of you.&nbsp; :-( I was recently waiting for a poor old lady who must have been in her 80&#039;s, stuck in the middle, and slowly making her way across, the jack@$$ behind me did not stop honking for a second, and when she passed I was turning, he bolted&nbsp; next to me, gave me a &#039;one finger&#039; salute and&nbsp; tossed&nbsp; a&nbsp; cup with ice at my car. :? No one should be going above 30 on any local Astoria&nbsp; street, there are aged, disabled, kids and just too many people&nbsp; to be driving like you&#039;re &#039;speed racer.&#039;&nbsp; You want to drive fast, get on the damn GCP.&nbsp; :x&nbsp; Condonlences&nbsp; to the family&nbsp; of those&nbsp; senselessly killed. :-(

				There is something I noticed in the news video report for this story.&nbsp; Normally, when a suspect is arrested by the 114th Precinct, they are led through the parking lot entrance to a waiting police cruiser on precinct property before being taken to central booking.&nbsp; I know because I see it all the time.<br /><br />It seems that because the local television news showed up, the NYPD went out of its way by taking the suspect from the front entrance (the long route from the holding cell in the back of the station) to a waiting police cruiser on Astoria Boulevard.&nbsp; The suspect was especially paraded for a highly visible perp walk for the benefit of the news media and the police.<br /><br />I do not in any way defend what the suspect is accused of, and my sympathies are for the victim&#039;s family.&nbsp; It seemed distasteful seeing that the police would go out of its way to make a show out of this.

				We saw the car last night, and stopped to look it over. Truly awful, the whole thing was basically flattened sideways, no doors. Not &#039;til we got home and read this thread, that we realized what we saw.<br /><br />So deeply sorry for the loved ones of the victims.

Walking with my kids I have to be really careful on the corners not to get run over because someone is always flying down the street to catch a green light, taking the turn too fast and losing some control over their vehicle. Also, if I am crossing the street and they are coming down to make a turn at a high rate of speed the drivers don&#039;t have time to see us. It is increasingly&nbsp; more and more of a threat to me-even at 10 in the morning. <br /><br />And forget about driving. Because I drive at a normal rate of speed and don&#039;t cut everybody off to get one car length in front and waste a lot of gas, some people get road rage and try to cut me off while swerving into my lane and nearly clipping me. People are really sick in the head and think they are somehow magically protected when they get in a vehicle because of that glass and metal barrier when in reality its the most dangerous place they could be.<br /><br />Now put drunk driving on top of that, and probably questionable character of this accused murderer and you&#039;ve got a tragedy. I feel very badly for those families. Two valuable, responsible members of society were taken because of the selfish actions of a degenerate. The best I can hope is that this guy one day realizes the gravity of what he has done and changes and that the families of the victims heal and move on with time.

				I love to drive, but also love to bike, so I can relate to the pedestrian traffic. Also, living on a busy corner makes me realize how incredibly annoying horns are, so I only tap it once in a while, and lean on it only when necessary (that&#039;s rare.)<br /><br />It&#039;s truly amazing how inconsiderate many people are.....in the case of this tragedy, I cannot understand how they can live with themselves AND repeat the same cruelty.

				This is what I don&#039;t get about this whole situation...the guy has money for a Land Rover, yet has a prior record that&#039;s pretty lengthy according to newsreports.&nbsp; So he&#039;s drunk (or under the influence, whatever), driving down the streets like a madman, smashes another car to smithereens, kills the two people in the car who are completely innocent, damages his own car extensively, <strong>but he walks away from the accident physically unharmed!!!</strong><br /><br />Life just isn&#039;t fair sometimes.<br />

				This story is just tragic.&nbsp; I absolutely hate it when I find out that people drink and drive.&nbsp; Even if it&#039;s one or two drinks, it really gets to me.&nbsp; I think we all know someone who&#039;s done this and shouldn&#039;t have.&nbsp; I know this story is different because the driver is someone who&#039;s so easy to demonize because of his prior record.&nbsp; He should never have been on the&nbsp; streets and I wonder if it&#039;s even his car.&nbsp; His court date was next month, for suspicion of murder?&nbsp; Why is he just on house arrest?&nbsp; And even that is unconfirmed.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I feel awful for the family.&nbsp; &nbsp;Life really isn&#039;t fair at all.<br /><br />

I see people doing crazy stuff all the time here, from illegal turns to blowing lights and stop signs and of course speeding. <br /><br /><br />

				This low life is going to get killed in prison,hopefully the sooner the better. He didn&#039;t look so tough while being led out of the precinct in handcuffs. The worst drivers are the ones with the biggest vehicles....Range Rovers,Hummers,Escalades,etc.

				yeah but why be confrontational in the first place...no one is asking you to break the law and don&#039;t take it personally.&nbsp; if someone&#039;s riding your bumper or driving aggressively, pull over and let them pass. <br /><br />you never know what the other driver&#039;s state of mind is. it&#039;s silly to police people just because you think you have an upper hand... we&#039;re getting off topic though so if anyone wants to pick this up under random gabble, we&#039;d be bound to follow

				I agree , id rather let a lunatic behind me pass ,cuz anyone who drives so close&nbsp; to your bumper on the highway isnt all there to begin with . Who know if they are carry a semi-automatic on their lap too . This world is crazy enough that even their weirdest things become reality sometimes &gt;So making someone like that&nbsp; angrier might lead to something very bad one day .&nbsp; &nbsp;I say this cuz i used to be like that too , and push people to the edge if they tailgated me , but eventually i figuered it wasnt worth it .&nbsp; <br /><br />One time was driving a bmw in the left lane going abt 65mph and some guy with a navigator&nbsp; was (no joke) inches behind me. He was so close i couldnt even see his plate from my mirror . we kept this distance for almost 10 mins . Neither of us would budge . If i even tapped my brake the slightest , he wouldve smashed into me . Obviously he didnt care , was sick or maybe he was the one looking to push someone to the edge due to the fact he didnt care to die and take someone with him . <br /><br />Finally , dont know if u people remember this but this is going back abt&nbsp; a good 10-12 yrs ago , someone i knew was getting on the gcp with their wife and small child when they were cut off by another car . Both cars came to a stop&nbsp; right before the enterance to the highway&nbsp; and words were exchanged . Finally the light turns green and a single shot was fired from the car who cut off the driver i knew . That bullet was meant for my friend and it missed him and his daughter by inches , yet it caught his wife in the head&nbsp; and she died on the spot&nbsp; 30 yrs young .&nbsp; I swear after that wake , never again did i ever push anyone tailgating me again .

				i was very sad to hear this news. The young woman, Panagiota had been friends with a lot of my friends and her wake was last night. I heard it was decorated very nicely with photographs of her and flowers. But, still... such terrible news.. and may she rest in peace.

				In a weird, twisted sort of way, perhaps Spitzers crazy idea of giving illegal aliens drivers licenses forcing them to get insurance may have somehow helped in this case.&nbsp; The community is now collecting money to send the lady home for burial.&nbsp; They will get no compensation at all, not that it would have made any difference since losing a child has to be the worse thing to ever happen to anyone.<br /><br />I was not an advocate of this idea, and I think that people would still drive without a license or insurance.

				Immigrant Gets Prison for Killing 2 in NYC Crash (http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2009/09/09/us/AP-US-Immigrant-Fatal-Crash.html)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">NEW YORK (AP) -- A drunken driver who slammed into a New York City livery cab and killed two people has been sentenced to 3 1/2 to 10 1/2 years in prison. The wreck came after he was ordered deported and charged in a deadly beating.<br /><br />Defense lawyer Russell Rothberg says Daryush (dahr-YOOSH&#039;) Omar apologized during sentencing Wednesday in Queens. The 25-year-old Omar pleaded guilty last month to vehicular manslaughter.<br /><br />The Nov. 16 crash killed cab driver Bessy Velasquez and Panayiota Demetriou (pah-nay-OH&#039;-tuh dehm-EE&#039;-tree&#039;-yoo), a graduate psychology student from Cyprus.<br /><br />A 2006 Manhattan murder case against Omar has stalled but remains open.

				He should not have been out and driving since he was&nbsp; supposed to be deported 4 years ago.&nbsp; &nbsp; They would still be alive if he had been sent back to wherever he was from, or kept in jail till it was found out where to send him. Those two would still be alive.&nbsp; &nbsp;3 and 1/2 years for killing two innocent people, doesn&#039;t sound fair, IMO.
