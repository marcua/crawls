				Applebee&#039;s is some sort of cosmic joke. That it gets any business defies all laws of God and Nature.<br /><br />I&#039;ve always liked Uno&#039;s. But I&#039;ve not been to one in years and years; since I left DC. Don&#039;t really plan on going to one sometime soon.

				Most people I know go to chain restaurants because they&#039;re consistent.

				Couple of comments here.&nbsp; <br /><br />Wife and I ate at an Applebees last month (we were upstate on a Sunday night and it was open).&nbsp; We went for 2 different chicken over salad dishes thinking it would be fairly heavy.&nbsp; Both had two types of cheese and the dish was smothered in sweet fattening dressing. And oh yes, mine had sour cream and guacamole on the side.&nbsp; The place is a vehicle for fat and carbs to suit the American palate.&nbsp; On the other hand the place is clean, prompt and does the trick when the mood strikes.<br /><br />Grubstreet.com posted an article on Chain restaurants and their good points which I wholeheartedly understand and can agree with.&nbsp; It&#039;s more about the ability through good management to maintain high standards in staffing, cleanliness, etc...<br /><br />But please know that I hate most chains and always prefer a cook doing his/her best to serve up something heartfelt. <br /><br />Here is the article:<br />http://nymag.com/daily/food/2007/10/chain_restaurants_are_where_it.html#gs-digest?om_u=BWZqog&amp;om_i=_BHIlRPBfphQ0Dj&amp;aid=388690249&amp;mid=1604719668&amp;time=1193432143&amp;issue=_BHIlRPBfphQ0Dj (http://nymag.com/daily/food/2007/10/chain_restaurants_are_where_it.html#gs-digest?om_u=BWZqog&amp;om_i=_BHIlRPBfphQ0Dj&amp;aid=388690249&amp;mid=1604719668&amp;time=1193432143&amp;issue=_BHIlRPBfphQ0Dj)

				Please help me then! Give me a list of some restaurants you recommend and I&#039;m open to trying them out. I was talking to my neighbor about this and she&#039;s also dissatisfied with the food in Astoria (besides the Greek food, of course), so I&#039;m not the only one who feels this way.<br /><br />I thought Stamatis was just ok. I didn&#039;t like Mundo as much as most people seem to. There&#039;s a Mexican place I tried on 30th ave near the new 7-11--I was expecting it to be decent because there were other Mexicans there but it was really disappointing. Jerusalem Pita House is ok; I would go there more because I think the owner is nice, but I&#039;ve had better falafel elsewhere. Omonia is extremely overpriced for what it is. I thought Sac&#039;s was extremely overpriced for what you get. <br /><br />I&#039;m not complaining; if I want to eat well or have specific cravings, I go to Manhattan or elsewhere. But if a good chain like Chipotle, Chili&#039;s or Jamba Juice (I would love to have a Jamba Juice in Astoria!) decides that Astoria would be a good market for their business, I would welcome it.

				What kind of restaurants are you looking for?&nbsp; I don&#039;t know the Greek restaurants, but I can recommend for Mexican: Luna on Broadway between 43 and 44 Streets.&nbsp; Also there&#039;s Los Portales on Broadway near Crescent.<br /><br />There are a bunch of great restaurants on 31 Ave. - J.J.&#039;s (sushi, Asian fusion) and Il Bambino (Italian, paninis).&nbsp; I&#039;m going to try Djerdan for burek this weekend, also on 31 Ave.<br /><br />Another good restaurant is Valverde (Italian), at the corner of Steinway and 36 Ave.<br /><br />If you like juice, there&#039;s a place called Latin Cabana on Steinway near 35 Ave. that does fruit juices.&nbsp; I believe that Sai&#039;s Organics on 30 Ave. also has freshly-squeezed juices.

				In the fantasy world that is my brain... <br /><br />those people who are patronizing Applebees and Pizzaria Uno are the same who come to the neighborhood to go to the movies (and take their children to R rated shows and talk on their cell phones during said shows).&nbsp; There&#039;s also those who come in for PC Richards who get hungry looking at all those appliances.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Please please please Astorians tell me that YOU don&#039;t go (won&#039;t go) to either of these spots.&nbsp; At least not more than once every 4 years.&nbsp; <br /><br />Disclosure: I once had a drink at Uno&#039;s while waiting to go see a movie.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				I&#039;ve tried Applebee&#039;s once, and didn&#039;t care much for the food, in the same way I don&#039;t care for The Olive Garden. Uno&#039;s is different though, I found they have better quality food in general. Mind you I&#039;ve only been to Uno&#039;s about 10 times in my life. I also prefer the independently owned restaurants, they&#039;re almost always better.

				Panera may have started local and I have heard good things about the original. But when they expanded and went national, they sacrificed quality for distribution. The same thing happened to Starbucks. Panera&#039;s isn&#039;t the really good bread that it once was and Starbucks is hardly even real espresso. (Don&#039;t even get me started on how not a cappuccino their cappuccinos are).<br /><br />And, dalty, food is not &quot;good or bad. Period.&quot; [sic] You&#039;re over simplifying a complex issue to see the view you want. You like Panera? Fine! Go there! But don&#039;t presume someone is an elitist just because they think the food there is blah.<br /><br />As for BBQ--no, the Southern style cookout is nothing here like it is NOLA or other places.<br /><br />Also, I would like to see some proof that places where there are chains are where people do more homecooking.<br /><br />Proof. <br /><br />Not your opinion, or what you saw, or what you think. Give me number or don&#039;t make those claims.

I don&#039;t disagree with anything other than asserting geo as an elitist (I don&#039;t think it&#039;s fair to make that conclusion from a message board, let alone from just one post). Restuarants will vary and there will be chains that are better and chains that are worse.<br /><br />The problem with the restaurant chain may be the reason why those Chinese restaurants are so bad. Since chain eateries have opened around the country, companies like SYSCO and other food providers have cornered the market on frozen, premade meals. I know that Igloo gets some of their food from them. I&#039;ve seen the delievery trucks and I recognize certain menu items from the same small restaurants back home. This happened because of the spread of chain restaurants and it&#039;s gotten to the point where it&#039;s incredibly difficult for smaller operations to avoid the tempting low price tags. This is, in my opinion, what marks the difference between the good, smaller, local restaurants and the bad. I try to focus my efforts on going to local restaurants that buy local. This can be hard and time-consuming, but I think it&#039;s also where you find the best food. <br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=8408.msg99062.html#msg99062">Quote from: rnrollgirl on October 29, 2007, 09:21:06 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">also, if a mom and pop restaurant does a consistently great and satisfying meal, they will eventually get a following and thrive.&nbsp; it&#039;s the mom and pop places that are doing average (or bad) food that will disappear, and then good riddance.&nbsp; make room for someone who can possibly do it better.&nbsp; and don&#039;t you think that chain restaurants fail in certain locations too.&nbsp; if they&#039;re not living up to the local standard (or someone else does it better) then they&#039;re not going to make it either.<br /><br />what about those local places that start off great, then expand, and for whatever reason aren&#039;t as good anymore (ie: service and/or food quality suffers).&nbsp; isn&#039;t that a shame too?&nbsp; <br /><br />i find that at least in the chains you get a certain amount of consistency.&nbsp; you know what you&#039;re going to get, wherever you go.&nbsp; if you&#039;re traveling and you&#039;re too tired to think of where you want to go for your one solid meal of the day, you want to know that the meal you&#039;re going to get is going to be ok.&nbsp; i&#039;ve traveled to a lot of places all over the world, and i try to frequent the local establishments as much as i can, but sometimes it&#039;s more of a hassle than a pleasure.&nbsp; in those instances, i have no problem hitting up a chain restaurant (hard rock cafe comes to mind) and i know that i&#039;ll get EXACTLY what i want for the price that i want.&nbsp; nothing wrong with that.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This last part is what frightens me, but it&#039;s purely a personal thing. I am frightened that all Americans want is consistency. We are loosing interest in quality, in the vital, exceptional things life has to offer. We look for a restaurant we recognize rather than a new one that could provide *gasp*! something unexpected! When did not knowing what was coming next in life become such a big, scary thing to the point where all our books, movies and restaurants just give us EXACTLY what we expect for the price we expect to pay.

				at it&#039;s core, i agree with you para, really i do.<br /><br />but if you are living or traveling with a budget in mind, you want to have the things that will make you happy at that time because that one purchase is what you can afford (or want to spend).&nbsp; if it happens to be something that is &quot;homogenized&quot; then so be it.&nbsp; and, if it happens to be something you want to purchase with an open mind and to try something different, then so be it too.<br /><br />i am all for trying new things, but there is a time and a place for it.&nbsp; and, as a creature of habit (as most people/animals are), there is also a time and a place.<br /><br />to each their own, for sure.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)

I grew up on a farm and small business in rural PA and I&#039;ve never been one for brands, for the most part. There are a couple of things I have soft spots for, but I don&#039;t buy clothes that aren&#039;t thrift store finds or made in America--this leaves most brands out, though their are some. I must admit to having a favorite brand of ice cream, but my favorite ice cream is the one that I can only get at the little local dairy in my hometown, so when I see smaller ice cream places pop up, I go there. I&#039;m not saying this is a better way to do things or that I don&#039;t fall into branding at times as well, but what I mean to say is that I really don&#039;t <strong>understand</strong> the way that other people buy things and go out and such because it&#039;s very, very foreign to me.<br /><br />I moved to NYC for the options. It just seems silly not to try every local coffee joint/restaurant/obscure cinema/bakery. Why pay the high COL, why live in a place that ain&#039;t the cleanest, why deal with the negative aspects of the city if you aren&#039;t going to really go all out in all the variety it presents? <br /><br />I don&#039;t mean to be critical of others, so I hope it isn&#039;t coming across that way, it&#039;s just my crazy little way of going about it!

				Well just because someone goes to a chain restaurant one day doesn&#039;t mean they don&#039;t frequent local establishments as well. &nbsp;For me, it&#039;s whatever I&#039;m in the mood for, and sometimes whatever&#039;s darn conveniently around. &nbsp;I go to chains I like, I go to local places I like. &nbsp;And honestly, most aren&#039;t particularily healthy for me, chain or not. &nbsp; Going to a chain one day doesn&#039;t mean I won&#039;t be supporting the Mom and Pop the next day. &nbsp;Or the very same day. &nbsp;And at the store, I usually buy what&#039;s on sale which hardly secures brand loyalty but I also know I don&#039;t want rough toilet paper or greasy shampoo. &nbsp;So I&#039;ll avoid certain brands and go for the ones I know and like. &nbsp;I do take risks and buy different ones though sometimes. &nbsp;I think everyone does things differently, and yeah, money plays a good part in it. &nbsp;It&#039;s hard to classify everyone into a certain type.

				I understand the money thing - I really do.&nbsp; And that&#039;s why the chains are so evil!&nbsp; They offer such cheap meals because (a) they use subpar ingredients (actually, there are no ingredients, just pre-made factory manufactured pseudo-food), (b) they receive tax breaks - HUGE corporations are able to get all sorts of financial incentives because they have a legal team that specializes in this, like subsidies for &quot;employee training&quot;, and (c) of the nature of their size they have more buying power and can get everything more cheaply.<br /><br />Mom and pops CANNOT compete in that environment.&nbsp; Our dollars mean something - and I understand that the majority of this country doesn&#039;t have enough of those dollars to make these kinds of decisions.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know what the answer is in a broader sense, but I do know that Astoria has many inexpensive food options (for now) that really make spending those dollars on big corporations unnecessary.<br /><br />Does this mean that I NEVER shop at chains?&nbsp; No - when I&#039;m in the suburbs or any area I don&#039;t know I first go to local places IF I CAN FIND THEM.&nbsp; I have been in many places where there are ONLY chain restaurants and then I have no choice and I make the best of it.&nbsp; To be fair I will say I have had a very good meal at PF Changs - and I would recommend them in that genre.&nbsp; But when I know I will be on the Thruway, for example, which has only chains at their reststops, I try to pick up a few maki at Go Wasabi or whatever and bring my food on the road.&nbsp; <br /><br />I guess, like Para, I just don&#039;t get the resistance to try new things - I have no idea what brand of TP I have in the house - I really don&#039;t care.&nbsp; I don&#039;t like Scotts so I don&#039;t buy that - but I&#039;ll try whatever else is on sale.&nbsp; I try new things all the time, I may find a brand I like but this doesn&#039;t preclude me from trying something else.&nbsp; Life is short and there&#039;s so much out there to explore!&nbsp; If I stick to the same ol&#039; same ol&#039; I might miss something.

				I guess for me the other scary thing is not only that chains encroach on local culture flavor etc. &nbsp;I think what mystified me most about all the panera&#039;s, Trader Joe&#039;s, Applebees posts is the EXCITEMENT people have about these places! &nbsp;There seems to be nothing exciting about them, or that can&#039;t be gotten nearby in better quality. &nbsp;I agree with geo and para that the encroachment of chains IS something to be concerned with, but it does appear to be a cultural issue. &nbsp;Americans value convience over cutlural identity- thus we see whole towns built of exactly the same 6 or 7 mega chains. &nbsp;And tourists seem to come visit new york, drink coffee at Starbucks, buy souveners at the Gap and eat at olive garden- did you know there is an hours long wait EVERY NIGHT at this place in Times square? &nbsp;But alas, I am in the minority- a new Best Buy opened on Broadway last week in the 60&#039;s and there was a LINE to get in the door....<br />

I just thought that the elitist comment was directed in another way. As long as we agree that food is more than just good or bad--it&#039;s a combination of tastes, budgets and it&#039;s a big influence in the lives of many people not only in terms of health and lifestyle for the consumer, but also for the families and communities that produce the goods!<br /><br />I like to think that when we say &quot;You are what you eat!&quot; we&#039;re talking about more than just the ingridients. <br /><br />As far as not having as good of a life experience... well, my personal opinion is that experience comes from doing different things and learning from them. So, if someone doesn&#039;t have access to X, Y, and Z, maybe they don&#039;t have as *many* different kinds of life experiences, but it&#039;s up to you to decide how many experiences and what kinds you want to have. I absolutely had to try rock climbing in the rockies! Is that necessary for a full life? Well, maybe not for you, but it was for me. Are their other experiences I will never have because I left home? Certainly! Maybe those are the experiences for other people, but they aren&#039;t the ones I chose. The trick is that whole &quot;know thyself&quot; thing. If I know that I want X, Y and Z, it&#039;s up to me to go out and find them.

				Geowrld, how I would love to sit down with you and talk this out.&nbsp; Some of your comments are just a bit too much and unnecessarily elitist.<br />1. I doubt that you had a stale bread at Panara. A place based upon fresh made (???) breads and in their first few weeks.&nbsp; The fact that they are using a company like sysco shows that they must be on a rotation schedule and most likely not serving rotten fish.<br />2. Not everything from national distribution companies are premade precooked and prepackaged food items.&nbsp; They are a source of low grade prison crap to high end supplies like fresh frozen fish from Hawaii to Foi gras from Canada and France. Thomas Kelly even uses them for supplies at certain points of the year because of distribution ability and reputation for clean handling.<br />3. Chains are big box crap I agree and they all strive for bank atm machine automation in some way or another. But It does suit some people. It even suits me once in a blue moon. Been to Paneras twice now for coffee and a sandwich. It worked for me and fit the bill at the time.&nbsp; <br />4. I dare you to find local fresh food product in NYC during February.&nbsp; It is all trucked it from one company or another.&nbsp; <br />5. Most restaurants fail in the first year due to poor planning, lack of funds and poor business management.&nbsp; Which goes back to one of my earlier comments about what chains ARE in fact good at.&nbsp; Funds, management, advertising, training.&nbsp; Chains treat it like a vending machine and Restaurant owners treat it like a labor of love. <br /><br />Pleas do not think I am a huge fan of chains, I just acknowledge some of their better points and shun them whenever possible.&nbsp; You are so right that this town needs not one of them with all we have at our fingertips in terms of fresh cooked worldly foods.&nbsp; Just asking that you take it down a notch.&nbsp; People will do what they like and maybe one day they will get a bit more educated and therefore healthier.&nbsp; I wonder when they will do a study comparing the calories, chemicals and food stuffs that they feed cattle and what they feed us on a national average.&nbsp; And sorry if I singled you out.&nbsp; You were speaking the loudest and it caught my eye.

				I won&#039;t disagree that American farms are endangered, but I don&#039;t know that it really boils down to chain restaurants. Not that I am a giant fan of chains. <br /><br /><br />My whole point is that you can&#039;t judge someone&#039;s relationship with food according to what restaurants they live near.

				as for the quality of food, i think they are more or less all the same.&nbsp; the only difference is who you <em>choose</em> to give your money to.&nbsp; the same goes for the stuff you buy in the supermarket and cook/prepare at home.<br /><br />of course each place might have their own vendor/distributor/supplier (or regionally, they might be the same), which may or may not have foods of a different quality (ie: fatty or lean, more or less salt or byproduct, etc), but that is up to the store&#039;s buyer to choose the product that will best represent their store/restaurant/deli/supermarket (and/or turn them a profit).&nbsp; and then it&#039;s up to you as the consumer to choose where/how you want to spend your money.<br /><br />as a full-on city girl, i know that unless you are growing/raising <span class="bbc_u">and</span> killing/processing your own food, it is still being processed and made by someone else; and ultimately, you have no idea what they are doing with it or where the corners are being cut.&nbsp; the vast majority of us don&#039;t live in an environment where we are particularly &quot;close&quot; to our food, and as someone who prefers to eat/take out (than cook), i stick by the places that serve me the best...some happen to be chain restaurants and others happen to be independent places.<br /><br />i think that is the bottom line with this ENTIRE discussion.&nbsp; first it&#039;s all about your personal taste/choice, and then secondly, buyer beware (as we&#039;ve all experienced with all of these recent food and product recalls).

				Handyman, even though you won&#039;t read this again, I will give you two answers:<br /><br />Yes, Starbucks does have sandwiches.

I know this because it&#039;s a chain and I ate there a few times when I was in college, and it was one of the few places in town to go.

And I think it&#039;s because of this that mom &amp; pop places in other areas have a harder time surviving, and the chains tend to prevail.

				Essen, I agree with you. New Yorkers tend to be a little more loose with their money.&nbsp; Where I&#039;m from, people are VERY tight, and I&#039;m not saying that this is great, but it DOES affect people&#039;s willingness to venture out.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think chains have caused this at all.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s just part of a more conservative culture.&nbsp; And, it makes sense, becuase money is harder to come by in these areas.&nbsp; So, when they do go out and eat, people want to go someplace where they know beforehand what they are getting for their money.&nbsp; The really sad thing is that this tightness with money spills over into every aspect of life....schools, roads, etc.&nbsp; Getting a tax bill passed to increase funding for local schools was like pulling teeth.&nbsp; I agree that if mom and pop places thrived in these areas, everyone would be better off.&nbsp; <br /><br />Aside from all of this, where I&#039;m from, the home-cooked meals are excellent, and every bit as tastey as anything around here.&nbsp; There is no bakery here that can touch my grandpa&#039;s fresh blackberry pie(with freshly picked, wild blackberries from his backyard, nonetheless....where are those around here?), and no BBQ joint that can touch my mother&#039;s BBQ.&nbsp; You CANNOT get fried catfish in NY that tastes as good as catching it in the river and having a fish fry that night.&nbsp; These people KNOW what good food tastes like.&nbsp; They are not deprived of good food AT ALL.&nbsp; They just have different good food than what we have here!&nbsp; The best steaks I&#039;ve ever had were back home, and I&#039;ve eaten at most of the &quot;best&quot; steakhouses in NYC.&nbsp; I honestly see no difference in Olive Garden telling you what Fetuccini is supposed to taste like, vs. some other restaurant.&nbsp; It&#039;s still a product of SOMEONE ELSE deciding what your fetuccini is going to be.&nbsp; Peter Luger claims to know what good steak tastes like..........HAH..........right.&nbsp; Their steak is good, but it&#039;s not GREAT.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had better...................OH..............but not in New York!&nbsp; In the middle of the country....in the midst of all of those chains.........I have had BETTER.<br /><br />

				Essen:&nbsp; Yes - I have been to Applebees - no, it&#039;s not as cheap as McDonalds, but compared to most privately owned restaurants, chain restaurants are cheaper.<br /><br />Dalty52: When I talk about good food - I&#039;m talking about restaurants.&nbsp; If I travel, I won&#039;t be knocking on someone&#039;s door looking for a home cooked meal - I will be looking for a restaurant.&nbsp; I think making a comparison between the quality of baked goods found at a bakery vs. what one can do at home (particularly when a parent or grandparent is doing the baking) is moot:&nbsp; home cooked is ALWAYS better.&nbsp; It&#039;s just not a valid point.&nbsp; <br /><br />And seriously?&nbsp; You&#039;re comparing the taste of fresh fish cooked just hours after it was caught to anything you might find in an urban restaurant?&nbsp; It&#039;s NOT comparable.&nbsp; It&#039;s a different animal (excuse the pun).&nbsp; OF COURSE the fresh fish is going to win out.&nbsp; <br /><br />The example of the fettucine is this:&nbsp; Fettucine will taste exactly the same every time you go to Olive garden because they don&#039;t have chefs preparing it from scratch in the back.&nbsp; It was formulated in a lab, manufactured in a room far, far away from where I will be eating it.&nbsp; If I order it at a &quot;real&quot; restaurant, it will be made that day and it will probably be slightly different each time.&nbsp; It will all generally be fettucine, but it will vary from place to place and day to day.&nbsp; It&#039;s like Sangria or Paella - you have your favorite places but it&#039;s still fun to find out how other places do it, or if the other bartender/chef is in today.<br /><br />I think (this is my opinion here) that doing the same thing over and over again inhibits innovation and that that stagnates growth.&nbsp; That&#039;s all.

				Here&#039;s a shocker... some people really do like chain restaurants. They&#039;re kid friendly, consistent, and reasonably priced. Many of the restaurants in our neighborhood are not kid friendly, tend to be on the pricier side, and are less consistent with food quality and service. <br /><br />One of the other pros to the chain restaurant is selection. Go to many restaurants around here, you get one chicken choice, one pasta choice, one meat choice, one or two types of salad and a couple of dressing options. Limited vegetarian options. You get stale bread, some frou-frou dessert selection, and a snobby waiter.<br /><br />Sometimes you just want a gooey cheesy pizza, a greasy burger, buffalo wings, and a chocolatey, decadent dessert that doesn&#039;t involve poached pears and some sort of french-sounding glaze. Sometimes you want to go someplace with a kid where they&#039;re going to get crayons, a drink that comes in a plastic cup, and a kid friendly portion of something that a kid would actually eat, where their squirming and fidgeting won&#039;t get you a nasty look from the diners around you. <br /><br />Chain restaurants aren&#039;t all that bad. Applebees is not one of my favorites, I&#039;ll admit, and frankly, I think the addition of another chain restaurant to that area, where parking is limited already, is going to be a traffic nightmare, but I&#039;m all for chains opening around here in general. They bring jobs to the area and are more likely to stay in business in the long run -- too often around here we see smaller places come and go, it&#039;d be nice to have someplace that actually sticks around. It seems hypocritical for people to want so desperately for a Barnes and Noble to open, but yet eschew the opening of a chain restaurant -- they&#039;re essentially the same thing, just peddling different wares.

				I have several dozen locally/independently-owned restaurants to choose from within walking distance of my apartment.&nbsp; I have 0 (zero) bookstores within walking distance of my apartment, whether chain or local.&nbsp; I live by Ditmars so I wouldn&#039;t count Seaburn, and I&#039;m not counting used bookstores, as wonderful as they are.<br /><br />If I had no restaurants to choose from within walking distance, I&#039;d probably feel differently about a chain restaurant opening (although I don&#039;t really know because I have not eaten at most of them) - I&#039;d be glad for <em>something</em>, although I&#039;d still prefer a locally-owned restaurant.&nbsp; Likewise, if a B&amp;N opened up near Ditmars, I&#039;d be thrilled, although I&#039;d really rather see a locally-owned bookstore.<br /><br />Barnes &amp; Noble is a New York original, btw.&nbsp; Its current CEO, who purchased the name rights in the 1970s and expanded it from one store on Fifth Ave. to what we know today (love it or hate it) graduated from Brooklyn Tech.

I&#039;d take McDonald&#039;s over All Star Burger (if given a choice, which Ditmars residents basically were) but I prefer to fill my prescriptions at Astor Pharmacy over Rite Aid or CVS. The latter two are of course good for other things that Astor Pharmacy is not, since they have a large selection of other items. I don&#039;t think it helps to make such broad arguments to cover two things that can vary so widely.

				I don&#039;t hate Starbucks for most of its business practices regarding itse employees, but there were good, local coffee shops in my hometown and other areas before Starbucks came around. While they may have populized the cappucino, it had been around long before them. And, in my opinion, I&#039;d rather go to local joints and taste the subtle differences of brewing techniques rather than get the same cup of coffee in every city I go to.<br /><br />Whereas Applebee&#039;s can&#039;t chase out every local restaurant, Starbucks has chased out local coffee shops in a number of smaller places where the market can&#039;t support multiple stores. I understand that the people living there made that choice with their purchases, but I can&#039;t help but feel like it&#039;s a shame.

				Repent! Repent! It’s the end of the world all ye sinners, I mean chain store customers – the end of the world!<br /><br />Applebee’s on the verge of coming to Astoria and Iran on the verge of acquiring a nuclear weapon? A coincidence or another manifestation of evil courtesy of the military-industrial complex?<br /><br />I don’t know about you but as soon as Applebee’s doors its door I’m heading down to my bunker, where it’s safe.<br />

				Applebees despite it being the chain from Satan&#039;s hellground does appeal to family&#039;s who want to go out. Believe me, you&#039;ll find peeps crowding there.

				I honestly think I&#039;m the only one who is actually happy for Applebee&#039;s to open.&nbsp; Pizzeria Uno&#039;s food makes me so sick and they&#039;re not the cleanest place either.&nbsp; A friend of mine who worked there said they had a bad cockroach and mice problem (not saying that it won&#039;t happen to Applebees in the future).&nbsp; For now, we should just be happy it&#039;s not going to be another bank.

				It&#039;s supposed to open today.&nbsp; There are too many other great restaurants for me to be eating at than Applebees, but I&#039;m sure they&#039;ll have business from others.&nbsp; Whatever floats people&#039;s boats.

				you know im really glad to hear im not the only one who doesn&#039;t like chain food. about 5 of my friends do &#039;man night&#039; every 2 weeks or so, and this involves steaks and beer at applebees or fridays, and they each drop like $30. I&#039;ve tried explaining that they could get way better food for that price at a local joint but they don&#039;t seem to wanna hear it. I only eat the deserts or fries from those places when I do let myself get dragged there. even the BURGERS are gross.

				I go to Starbuck&#039;s pretty much every morning and always thought their capp was great, but then I went on a scout in a town called Glenns Fall in upstate NY and stopped in at a local coffee house.&nbsp; I had a cappuccino (served in a heavy oversized ceramic mug) and a scone.&nbsp; Oh my God . . . what a difference . . .good bitter coffee, thick head of foam, buttery scone.&nbsp; I now (sadly) realize that Starbuck&#039;s may be everywhere but they are not good . . . they are not hand crafting one coffee at a time and it tastes it.<br /><br />Applebees . . . what does one really need to say about that.&nbsp; Stores like Applebees, banks, nail salons always crop up in poor neighborhoods because it makes poor people feel like they can afford something . . . even though they are really getting ripped off.&nbsp; What Astoria really needs is a bookstore, a community theatre, a place to hear live music . . . places people can go to enrich their minds, get better educated, get better jobs and make real money . . . and not throw away what little cash they have on bad-for-you food and long red nails with stars on the end!!!
