				One of my friends is really into feng shui and has rearranged her whole apartment to create more harmony. I was thinking about getting her some sort of gift that would be feng shui related? I&#039;ve been looking online and keep running into these cheesy little trinkets or water fountains. Some of the fountains are actually kind of cool, very simple designs, but I know nothing about this stuff and don&#039;t want to buy her something that she will throw away or hate. Can anyone advise me on this stuff? Thanks for any help!!!

				Apple has always been associated with peace and harmony by the Chinese. And since it is also the symbol of NYC, a beautiful glass apple might be a nice gift. AND, if your friend is also a MAC user, you will definitely score big points! There are some lovely ones at the bottom of <span class="bbc_u">this</span> (http://buy-fengshui.com/fengshui_products_category/flowers_plants.php) page.
