				Doubt that Giuliani would get the nomination. Interesting thing is that if he did get the nod, it would steer the Republicans back towards the center and away from the religious right.&nbsp; There is just no way he would get their full support nor would he suck up to it like Mcain.

				I cast a vote for Giuliani under the assumption I had to pick between the two. I don&#39;t think I would vote for him (still rooting for some others to join in) but given the option, I don&#39;t think that the U.S is ready for either a female nor a minority (Barack) president. I don&#39;t think the country is there yet. So the question would be does Giuliani have enough baggage to push Hillary in? I just don&#39;t see it happening..not because I don&#39;t want to see it mind you.

				I know this all like trying to read tea leaves before the stove is even on to bring a kettle to boil.<br /><br />And if I am not misreading, Senator Clintion has a lead in NH among independents already despite the buzz for Senator Obama.<br />***<br /><br /><br /><br />http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/02/07/schneider.nh.polls/<br /><br /><br />WASHINGTON (CNN) -- We have the latest New Hampshire primary polls. It&#39;s getting real interesting -- The race on the Republican side is now neck-and-neck!<br />The CNN/WMUR presidential primary poll, conducted by the University of New Hampshire, found Sen. John McCain of Arizona the choice of 28 percent of voters who plan to vote in the state&#39;s Republican presidential primary next January, compared with 27 percent for Giuliani. <br />The results were a statistical dead heat, given the poll&#39;s sampling error of plus or minus 5.5 percentage points. (Complete poll results -- PDF)<br />The poll involved interviews with 311 New Hampshire residents who say they will vote in the 2008 Republican primary conducted by telephone by the University of New Hampshire Survey Research Center on February 1-5, 2007.<br />The poll is not good news for McCain. McCain won the New Hampshire primary in 2000 and he&#39;s been leading polls of New Hampshire Republicans for the past two years -- until now.<br />Giuliani seems to have gotten a boost from his visit to New Hampshire last month. <br />Is Giuliani crowding McCain for the support of moderate Republicans? Actually, no. McCain leads Giuliani by nearly two to one among moderate Republicans -- 41 percent to 22 percent.<br />McCain has been currying favor with conservatives. But despite his views on abortion rights, gay rights and gun control, Giuliani seems to be rallying conservative voters in New Hampshire.<br />&quot;We have to reassert the basic core principles of the Republican Party,&quot; Giuliani told New Hampshire party activists in January. &quot;We&#39;ve got to be about being Republican strong, not Democrat light.&quot;<br />Giuliani leads among conservatives in New Hampshire, where McCain&#39;s support drops by half. The CNN/WMUR poll found 31 percent of conservatives had Giuliani as their top pick, while only 20 percent of conservatives tapped McCain.<br />New Hampshire Republicans seem to remember McCain as the anti-Bush candidate in 2000. McCain leads Giuliani among New Hampshire Republicans who are critical of Bush. But that&#39;s only about a third of Republicans. Most Republicans like Bush -- and Giuliani.<br />In 2000, McCain was helped by Independents who voted in the Republican primary. But this year, two thirds of New Hampshire Independents say they plan to vote in the Democratic primary.<br /><br />Independents strongly anti-war<br />Independents are strongly anti-Bush and antiwar, and that&#39;s drawing them into the Democratic contest where they make up more than half the primary voters.<br />Hillary Clinton is still in first place among New Hampshire Democratic primary voters with 35 percent naming her as their top choice. But Barack Obama has vaulted into the number two spot with 21 percent, and former Sen. John Edwards is at number three at 16 percent.<br />The margin of error for the poll is plus-or-minus 5 percent. The poll of Democrats involved interviews with 353 New Hampshire residents who say they will vote in the 2008 Democratic primary conducted by telephon by the University of New Hampshire Survey Research Center on February 1-5, 2007.<br />Clinton commands the loyalty of registered Democrats -- 39 percent of registered Democrats preferred her, compared to 18 percent who planned to vote for Obama.<br />But Clinton&#39;s lead is considerably smaller among Independents who intend to vote in the Democratic primary. Only 30 percent of registered Independents preferred Sen. Clinton compared to 24 percent who planned to back Obama. <br />Independents like Obama&#39;s stand on the war.<br />For voters, the toughest choice is usually between candidates with similar views -- McCain and Giuliani; Clinton and Obama.<br />That&#39;s why the New Hampshire primary could get very close in both parties. And very exciting.<br />

				An earlier Presidential Primary would be a good thing.&nbsp; As things are currently set up the race is over by the time we get to vote (so you don&#39;t even get to vote for your first choice most of the time).&nbsp; I do think, however, that with candidates in both parties running as home-state candidates, they are likely to swamp their opposition.&nbsp; I suspect Clinton and Giuliani both win NY, if they are both in the race when the primaries start.

				I like a lot of the Democratic candidates. What I don&#039;t like is how the media focuses on just a few candidates, in this case Hillary and Obama, instead of highlighting the details of all the candidates on the campaign trail.&nbsp; It makes as if we have limited choices, and puts the other candidates at a disadvantage.&nbsp; This happens with the Republicans too.&nbsp; The primaries are supposed to be about choice, yet the only candidates that get any attention&nbsp; from the media are the ones with names and money.&nbsp; It&#039;s sad really.&nbsp;

Others candidates were just starting to warm up.<br />Senator Hillary Clinton, Senator John McCain, Governor Bill Richardson, and former Governor Mitt Romney all raised or spent in excess of $10 million in 2005-2006. These were several politicians who, because of federal or state elections races, or federal PAC activity, or their position in national organizations in 2005-2006, had a full fundraising and finance system operating and a team of staff, specialists and consultants on board.<br /><br />Senator Joe Biden, Senator Barack Obama, and former Governor George Pataki raised or spent between $5 million and $10 million in 2005-2006.<br /><br />Cash on hand at the end of 2006 was less of an indicator since it was a fleeting snapshot of the cash balance on one day. And January 2007 activity has already changed the numbers. The public will not see an update on the financial scoreboard until the first quarter financial reports are filed in mid-April. Until then candidates doing well in fundraising at events or with certain methods will be leaking unverifiable totals to the media.<br /><br />With some candidates utilizing federal campaign committees, federal political action committees, Section 527 accounts, state level political action committees, and state campaign committees, there will be less potential for serious auditing and compliance oversight of financial activity. These various accounts fall under the jurisdiction of the Federal Election Commission, the Internal Revenue Service, and various state ethics and election agencies and officials.<br /><br />With some candidates already announcing that they will not take federal funds for the primary and possibly the General Election, they will be less likely to be audited by the Federal Election Commission. If federal funds go to a campaign, they are subject to a mandatory audit by the FEC. &nbsp;<br /><br />From CQ Weekly: Candidates Link Into the Social Networking Scene for 2008<br />...<br /><br />***<br /><br />[The parent company of Dr Pepper has Billions in revenues.

Please vote for your favorite candidate, and whoever receives the most votes by midnight Tuesday, February 27, will receive a $5,000 contribution to their campaign from the Progressive Patriots Fund.<br />Vote Now!<br /><br />To take back the House, Democrats had to unseat incumbents in historically Republican districts – seats the Republicans once considered safe. Thanks to your help, and the help of progressives across the country, the 2008 election will feature incumbent Democrats like Representatives Dave Loebsack, Carol Shea Porter and many others.<br /><br />In just over a year and a half these newly elected House Democrats are up for re-election and we need to make sure they keep their hard-won seats and maintain our Democratic majority. That is why, for the first &quot;Pick a Progressive Patriot&quot; of 2007 we are featuring ten House incumbents who are expected to be in some of the most competitive races of 2008.<br /><br />Together we can ensure that these new House members get off on the right foot for their 2008 campaigns. All of these Representatives need our support and it&#039;s important that you vote for your favorite candidate to help us determine to whom we should contribute.<br />Vote Now!<br /><br />We want to build on the momentum we created in 2006 in order to grow our majority in Congress. The first step is to ensure we keep the seats we fought so hard to win. Let&#039;s make the progressive force we established in Congress a lasting one.<br /><br />Thank you for all of your support, and be sure to take a few moments to vote!<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Russ Feingold<br />United States Senator<br />Honorary Chair, Progressive Patriots Fund&quot;<br /><br />

				I kind of like NYCMacuser&#039;s take on this. Wanting a president to have military experience may be more dependent on a voter&#039;s orientation. I am not for war, and my actually have more respect for a president that opposed military involvement, as he/she would represent more my own views. However, we do need a military, a defense, and I would be more comfortable is someone, at least in the cabinet had years and experience of knowledge in that arena.

				<br />Growing A Third Party<br /><br />By David S. Broder<br />Sunday, February 25, 2007; <br /><br />Somewhere in America, there are 35,000 people looking at the preliminaries to the 2008 presidential race from a different perspective than that of millions of their fellow citizens.<br /><br />They are the people who have signed up so far to participate in Unity08, the effort to launch a bipartisan third-party campaign with the first Internet nominating convention in history. I wrote about this unusual venture when it was launched last year by Hamilton Jordan and Jerry Rafshoon, both formerly of Jimmy Carter&#039;s White House; Angus King, the former independent governor of Maine; and Douglas Bailey, a veteran Republican consultant and political adviser.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />I contacted Bailey recently to ask what had happened to this bold gamble, and he was the source of that 35,000 figure for the number of people who have lent support to the scheme. They obviously have a long way to go before they can claim to be a viable political force, but they are making slow, steady progress.<br /><br />When I called Bailey, it had been just a week since the group announced that anyone who was interested could sign up at http://www.unity08.com as a voting delegate to a national convention planned for June 2008. Most of the sign-ups came before that formal start, Bailey said, in response to last year&#039;s publicity about the formation of Unity08.<br /><br />&quot;The need [for a third party] is as great as it&#039;s ever been,&quot; Bailey said. &quot;The partisan bickering in Washington continues nonstop, and the contest for the nominations in both parties is likely to make it worse.&quot;<br /><br />He pointed to two problems that many of us have decried. &quot;The leading candidates in both parties have suggested they will decline federal matching funds and plan to spend unlimited sums,&quot; he said. &quot;They expect the bundlers -- the people collecting for them -- to raise a million dollars each, and what do they [the bundlers] expect in return?&quot;<br /><br /><strong>Second, Bailey said, &quot;the likelihood is that the nominees of both parties will be determined by the first three or four primaries, which means that 99 percent of the people who will vote in November will have absolutely no say in the names that are on the ballot. It&#039;s not surprising that they may be looking for an alternative.&quot;<br /><br />None of that is implausible. But where does the alternative come from? Bailey and his partners have an answer, but the process they have in mind still strikes me -- as it did when it was first outlined -- as extremely cumbersome.</strong><br /><br />In a few weeks, they will outline provisional rules for their own nomination process, determining how candidates will qualify and how the voting will be conducted. The goal is to pick either a political independent for president or to form a ticket with both a Democrat and a Republican. Feedback will be welcomed before the rules are made final, he said.<br /><br /><strong>Then comes the hard part. Thirty-nine states allow a new party to petition its way onto the presidential ballot, without having a named candidate, but the deadlines and numbers of signers required vary widely. The first test will be whether Unity08 attracts enough volunteers and money to carry out that effort.</strong><br /><br />And then comes the challenge of recruiting a candidate or candidates for Unity08 to back. If its organizers had a compelling person already lined up, their task would be much easier, but they do not.<br /><br />I suggested to Bailey that the underlying premise of this campaign -- the need to cure the partisanship of Washington -- might be undercut if the Republicans and Democrats nominated people who are not closely associated with those partisan battles -- mentioning Rudy Giuliani, Mitt Romney and Mike Huckabee on the GOP side and Barack Obama and Bill Richardson among the Democrats.<br /><br />&quot;To the degree that the nominees of the two parties recognize that bipartisan leadership is essential, then it shows the political process has made a self-adjustment, and that is good,&quot; he said. &quot;But the usual game is to target the base of your party, rile it up with wedge issues and ignore the middle.<br /><br />&quot;If they do that again, we will be ready. It is possible the parties can right the ship themselves, but I don&#039;t have a lot of confidence in that happening.&quot;<br /><br />davidbroder&nbsp; AT washpost.com<br />

				<br />** Is this kind of reporting for free; fun **<br /><br /><br />&quot;He said, you know, it&#039;d be great one day if I could run for president. And I made a comment like, yeah, yeah that would be great — come on over here and meet my Aunt Gracie,&quot; Robinson said.<br /><br />The actual decision to run was much tougher. Robinson said his sister, concerned about guaranteeing a normal childhood for the couple&#039;s two daughters, had to be won over — as did her mother. But the groundswell of public support that Obama — who gained national attention with his speech at the 2004 Democratic convention — received last fall made the candidacy seem especially feasible, Robinson said.<br /><br />&quot;This is one of those things that&#039;s more important than the individuals involved,&quot; Robinson said. &quot;This is the ultimate team assignment. So everybody has to give up something to make this work.&quot;<br /><br />Michelle Obama acknowledged a degree of uncertainty, but said it had more to do with her own personal feelings about whether entering politics was the best way to effect change.<br /><br />&quot;I&#039;m one of the skeptics that Barack often talks about,&quot; she said. &quot;Like most people, my view about politics — and it&#039;s evolved, but it had been — that politics is for dirty, nasty people who aren&#039;t really trying to do much in the world.&quot;<br /><br />Robinson said he asked himself not whether Obama should run, but rather why he shouldn&#039;t. <br /><br />&quot;You could wait around until another opportunity, but you might not get another opportunity,&quot; Robinson said. <br /><br />He has tried to impart that same confidence to his players. Hired last summer after six years as an assistant at Northwestern, Robinson said he wasn&#039;t sure the Brown team, which has struggled to crack the upper echelon of the Ivy League, could even win six games this season. <br /><br />But heading into their final games of the season against Penn and Princeton this weekend, Robinson&#039;s Bears have equaled their win total — 10 — from last year. Players describe him as a demanding and motivational coach who instituted 5:45 a.m. practices last fall and is not afraid to shake up the lineup. He preaches perfection, said sophomore Scott Friske. <br /><br />&quot;During the games, he&#039;s cheering you on as much as the crowd is,&quot; Friske said. <br /><br />But they say he&#039;s also deeply interested in their lives away from the game. <br /><br />&quot;Once you step off the basketball court, he&#039;s as down to earth as anybody,&quot; said Mark McAndrew, now Brown&#039;s leading scorer who averaged barely 10 minutes a game last season. &quot;He has a very open-door policy.&quot; <br /><br />Robinson aspires to win the Ivy League title, something Brown hasn&#039;t done since 1986. But he said his ambition pales in significance to Obama&#039;s. <br /><br />&quot;What we&#039;re doing is just a game,&quot; he said. &quot;What he&#039;s doing, it affects so many different people.&quot;<br /><br />** And remember also these two words; Dog Balls! **<br />

				<br /><br />&quot;Mayor Giuliani has the utmost respect for Governor Romney. The mayor&#039;s position on gay marriage has been both clear and consistent — he does not support gay marriage and believes marriage should be between a man a woman.&quot;<br />** and His mistresses ** <br /><br />GOP hopefuls court conservatives <br />By LIZ SIDOTI, Associated Press Writer<br /><br /><br />Republican Mike Huckabee cast himself Friday as a lifelong conservative the GOP can count on as he fought for the support of restless right-wing activists still searching for a presidential candidate.<br /><br />&quot;We can&#039;t afford to elect people who simply reflect a culture and reflect a common view, but don&#039;t necessarily believe it,&quot; the former Arkansas governor said, indirectly referring to the three leading GOP candidates — Sen. John McCain (news, bio, voting record) of Arizona, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and ex-Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts.<br /><br />They are considered the most serious contenders for the Republican nomination. But conservatives are questioning their credentials and aren&#039;t sold on any of them. Thus, several other lesser-known candidates like Huckabee are hoping to emerge as strong challengers by capturing the backing of that critical part of the GOP base.<br /><br />Huckabee was one of several White House hopefuls in the crowded field to address thousands of activists attending the annual Conservative Political Action Conference.<br /><br />&quot;Maybe this weekend it might be renamed the conservative presidential anxiety conference,&quot; Huckabee said, reflecting the mood of the annual convention, to ripples of chuckles. &quot;The theme might be &#039;Dude, where&#039;s my candidate?&#039; &quot;<br /><br />&quot;I&#039;d like to think that maybe he&#039;s standing in front of you,&quot; Huckabee said.<br /><br />In a well-received speech, Huckabee emphasized his conservative positions on abortion, gay marriage and guns, while seeking to reassure the activists that he&#039;s a fiscal conservative despite raising taxes as governor.<br /><br />Giuliani and Romney — two of the three top candidates — were speaking later Friday, as was Sen. Sam Brownback (news, bio, voting record) of Kansas, a darling of the religious right. Reps. Tom Tancredo of Colorado and Duncan Hunter (news, bio, voting record) also were appearing, as was former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore.<br /><br />Only McCain, an Arizona senator and failed 2000 GOP candidate, skipped the event to campaign and fundraise elsewhere instead.<br /><br />The slight was sure to further irritate conservatives who already are skeptical that they can trust him because of his reputation of bucking the party. Even though he has a conservative social and fiscal voting record, McCain has angered conservatives with his work on campaign finance reform, immigration and other legislation they hate.<br /><br />Aside from McCain, conservatives also question Romney&#039;s sincerity in opposing abortion and gay marriage. He has a record of equivocation on some major issues and outright switching on others. And, Giuliani is on the wrong side of many of the same social issues that conservatives hold dear, including abortion, gun control and gay rights.<br /><br />The series of speeches in Washington came a day after Romney assailed McCain and Giuliani — an indication of the GOP contest was taking on a sharper tone a full ten months before the first primary votes are cast.<br /><br />Romney told New Hampshire voters on Thursday that McCain was devising an immigration policy that was the &quot;wrong course&quot; for the nation. And Giuliani&#039;s positions on abortion, gay marriage and gun control were a losing combination in the GOP primary, he told a television program aimed at Christian conservatives viewers.<br /><br />In Utah for a fundraiser, McCain responded to Romney&#039;s criticisms by saying he believes that a comprehensive approach to immigration is needed. &quot;So does the president of the United States. None of us support amnesty, and we need to secure our borders,&quot; the senator said.<br /><br />Giuliani spokeswoman Katie Levinson replied: &quot;Mayor Giuliani has the utmost respect for Governor Romney. The mayor&#039;s position on gay marriage has been both clear and consistent — he does not support gay marriage and believes marriage should be between a man a woman.&quot;<br /><br />

				(from the blogosphere on cpac )<br /><br />The Straw Poll<br /><br />One of the hottest things going this weekend is the CPAC Straw Poll. The questions run as follows:<br /><br />From the following list, who would be your FIRST choice to be the Republican Nominee for President in 2008?<br /><br />1. Sam Brownback<br />2. Jim Gilmore<br />3. Newt Gingrich<br />4. Rudy Giuliani<br />5. Chuck Hagel<br />6. Mike Huckabee<br />7. Duncan Hunter<br />8. John McCain<br />9. George Pataki<br />10. Ron Paul<br />11. Mitt Romney<br />12. Tom Tancredo<br />13. Tommy Thompson<br />14. Other<br />15. Undecided<br /><br />Romney&#039;s perceived relative liberalism will be more than offset by the vast number of volunteers he has present. I&#039;m guessing that the number of Romney volunteers is actually more than the rest of the Presidential hopefuls&#039; combined. Brownback has the second best presence, followed by former Virginia Governor Gilmore. I just overhead some guy at the bar say that this is the first event Gilmore has pressed at. His end total will be disproportionately large due to the home state factor.<br /><br />The only other names on the list with volunteers on the ground are Hunter and Tancredo. I&#039;ve seen both Newt and Huckabee in the flesh, but there have been no Rudy sightings on my end as of yet.<br /><br />Predicting the Winner<br /><br />Here is how I expect the vote totals to come:<br />1. Mitt Romney - the man just has an army here. The votes of the volunteers themselves will skew the vote.<br />2. Mike Huckabee - the man lit it up this morning with his &quot;I am Republican -- hear me roar!&quot; speech.<br />3. Sam Brownback - Strong presence on the ground coupled with his big time righty social agenda will place him disproportionately well here.<br />4. Jim Gilmore - only because he is a homer<br />5. Rudy Giuliani - despite his lack of a ground presence and his left leaning nature, it is hard to put the national frontrunner below 4th.<br />6-13. Newt, McCain, Tancredo, Pataki, Paul, Douglas, Thompson, Hagel.<br /><br />The following question asks who would be your SECOND choice to be the Republican Nominee for President in 2008? I&#039;m not going to bother ranking this one.<br /><br />Another gem of a question is as follows: all things being equal, would you be MOST likely to support a Republican Nominee for President who called themselves a...<br />1. Ronald Reagan Republican<br />2. George W. Bush Republican<br />3. Neither<br />4. Either<br /><br />...<br /><br />

				** I think these are the kind of articles RG wants to see. I wonder if his national support will hold up when more GOP get to know his social stances and personal bio. And it will be interesting to see how his views morph as he spends more time away from liberal North East.<br /><br />Is Giuliani more popular outside of NYS than inside?<br /><br />I think we may see very interesting races on both sides. Hopefully. **<br /><br />http://www.cqpolitics.com/2007/03/giuliani_gains_traction_from_c.html<br /><br /><br />Giuliani Gains Traction from Campaign’s Popularity Contest Phase<br />By Jessica Benton Cooney&nbsp; &nbsp; Mar. 02, 2007<br /><br /><br />To figure out why former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has widened his lead over other Republican presidential contenders in preference polls of GOP voters, take a look just below the surface of those horserace numbers. <br /><br />A Washington Post-ABC News survey conducted Feb. 22-25 showed 64 percent of all respondents, including Democrats and unaffiliated voters as well as Republicans, said they had a favorable impression of Giuliani, a stronger showing than any other presidential contenders mentioned in the survey. <br /><br />Most political analysts believe, though, that the admiration for Giuliani stems from the one predominant aspect of his persona — the steadfast image he projected in leading his city through the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the twin towers of the World Trade Center — with any serious examination of his overall record as mayor, his views on issues and his personal background still to come.<br /><br />In fact, another survey, the Fox News/Opinion Dynamics Poll conducted February 27-28, reported that 65 percent of those polled believed that “America’s Mayor,” a label bestowed on him in the wake of 9/11, was a good description of Giuliani. <br /><br />“A lot of popularity is based on name recognition, and who is in the media and press at the moment,” said Andrew Smith, director of The Survey Center at the University of New Hampshire, whose home state next January will host its traditional first-in-the-nation presidential primary. <br /><br />But the high regard in which Giuliani is currently held is a good place to start. Lawrence Shiman, vice president of the Opinion Dynamics firm that produced the latter poll in concert with Fox News, said, “The continued surge of Giuliani makes it more difficult for any other [Republican] candidate to make a serious challenge.”<br /><br />The second most-admired Republican presidential candidate in the Washington Post-ABC News poll — Arizona Sen. John McCain, viewed positively by 52 percent of respondents — was wedged between the two front-runners in the field for the Democratic presidential nomination.<br /><br />Charismatic Illinois Sen. Barack Obama had a favorable rating of 53 percent among respondents of all partisan persuasions. New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, the former first lady and still the leader in most Democratic voter preference polls, was had the second-highest favorability rating among Democratic candidates and was fourth among all mentioned candidates at 49 percent. <br /><br />Clinton still holds the lead in “horse race” polls on the Democratic nomination, but her margin has been slipping. The Washington Post-ABC News poll showed Clinton leading Obama by 36 percent to 24 percent, her margin halved from her 41 percent to 17 percent lead over Obama in a poll taken Jan. 16-19.<br /><br />The Fox News poll seconded this trend, with Clinton leading Obama by 34 percent to 23 percent, down from 43 percent to 15 percent in late January. <br /><br />“I’m expecting the Democratic race to be a fight to the end,” said Shiman. “The Democratic race is a lot more open, but it will be very difficult for a candidate to make up ground that is not already a superstar.”<br /><br />...

				<br />GOP Sen. Chuck Hagel to announce political plans<br />Story Highlights<br /><br />• Sen. Hagel will make an announcement about his plans Monday<br />• Hagel is considered a potential candidate for the GOP presidential nomination<br />• The two-term senator is an outspoken critic of the war in Iraq<br />• Polls show Hagel trailing the pack of other potential contenders<br /><br />From Dana Bash<br />CNN<br /><br />WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel is expected to announce his decision on a presidential race Monday in his home state of Nebraska.<br /><br />Hagel&#039;s advisers <strong>would not</strong> confirm that the two-term senator planned to announce his bid for the Republican presidential nomination, but Hagel said in January he would make a decision about a presidential run soon.<br /><br />Hagel, 60, also is scheduled to appear next week at a forum for presidential hopefuls put on by the International Association of Firefighters.<br /><br />Hagel, a decorated infantry sergeant in Vietnam, <strong>supported the 2002 congressional resolution that authorized the invasion of Iraq the following year</strong>, but he has since become an outspoken critic of the war.<br /><br />He called President Bush&#039;s plan to increase U.S. troops in Iraq &quot;the most dangerous foreign policy blunder in this country since Vietnam.&quot;<br /><br />Hagel joined six other Republicans last month to back a non-binding resolution opposing the troop increase, a measure that failed on a procedural vote.<br /><br />In a newly published interview in Esquire magazine, Hagel said Bush appears to believe he&#039;s no longer accountable, <strong>&quot;which isn&#039;t totally true. You can impeach him, and before this is over, you might see calls for his impeachment. I don&#039;t know. It depends how this goes.&quot;</strong><br /><br />Other than his break with the party on Iraq, Hagel has an an orthodox GOP voting record. He supported the Bush tax cuts in 2001, has a perfect score on abortion issues from the National Right to Life Committee and backed efforts to open part of Alaska&#039;s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration.<br /><br />Polls suggest he will face an uphill battle in the GOP primaries, which have already drawn a crowded field. (Gallery: Possible contenders)<br /><br />A CNN/WMUR poll conducted in February found him trailing the pack among potential GOP voters in the first primary state of New Hampshire, drawing 1 percent support.<br /><br />A national poll, conducted for CNN by Opinion Research Corp. in January, also put him at 1 percent among registered Republicans. By comparison, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani led that survey at 32 percent, while Arizona Sen. John McCain, Hagel&#039;s friend and frequent ally, came in at 26 percent.<br /><br />McCain, also a Vietnam veteran, is a leading supporter of Bush&#039;s decision to bolster the U.S. contingent there. McCain said having an anti-war candidate in the race &quot;will certainly add another element&quot; to the GOP contests, &quot;because everybody else... at least to some degree or another, says they support [the war].&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I&#039;m sure he&#039;ll be a good campaigner,&quot; McCain said. &quot;He&#039;s a very articulate, attractive, handsome man with an impressive record. <strong>Not better looking than me</strong>.&quot;<br /><br />Hagel&#039;s second term in the Senate is up in 2008.<br /><br />&nbsp; <br />Find this article at: <br />http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/03/07/hagel.bid&nbsp; <br />

				<br />The Zogby International survey also tested several combinations of possible 2008 presidential general election match–ups, pairing the top three candidates from each party:<br /><br />Giuliani 47%, Clinton 40%<br />&nbsp;<strong>Giuliani 40%, Obama 46%</strong><br />&nbsp;Giuliani 46%, Edwards 40%<br />&nbsp;<br />McCain 47%, Clinton 39%<br />&nbsp;<strong>McCain 40%, Obama 44%</strong><br />&nbsp;McCain 47%, Edwards 38%<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Romney 35%, Clinton 45%<br />&nbsp;Romney 29%, Obama 51%<br />&nbsp;Romney 32%, Edwards 47%</strong><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />While 32% gave Bush positive marks for his overall job performance, 68% gave him negative ratings. Older Americans were more likely to give him slightly better ratings than younger counterparts, the survey shows. While 61% of Republicans gave him positive marks, just 9% of Democrats and 26% of self–described independents awarded the President a positive job approval rating.<br /><br />**&nbsp; :-o&nbsp; Last polling from Zogby, surprised to see Obama doing that well in matchups, but perhaps he is either not that defined, or his support has spread quickly. Lots of undecideds and fluidity. Now watch next month show very different results. While a surprising small number are already paying attention, many probably will not give it much consideration until closer to October 2008. Much other fun to be had in 2007.<br />The Prez still at least has majority support in his own Party **<br />

				** while this might be good for the people of Nebraska, I am starting to wonder if this is an audition for the role of Hamlet **<br /><br /><br />Hagel puts off decision on 2008 bid By MARGERY BECK, Associated Press Writer<br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />Sen. Chuck Hagel (news, bio, voting record), one of the more forceful Republican voices in opposition to the Iraq war, on Monday put off a decision about a possible presidential bid, saying he wanted to focus on the conflict and other pressing national issues.<br /><br />In an odd twist, the Nebraska senator called a news conference to say he would decide about his political future later this year, saying a late entry into the 2008 race is still possible.<br /><br />&quot;I want to keep my focus on helping find a responsible way out of this tragedy,&quot; Hagel said of the Iraq war.<br /><br />The Republican presidential field is crowded with 10 candidates, a number that could grow as Newt Gingrich and Fred Thompson weigh possible bids. Hagel&#039;s planned announcement touched off speculation that he would join the 2008 White House race or announce plans to seek re-election to a third Senate term.<br /><br />Instead, he told reporters at a nationally televised news conference: &quot;I am here today to announce that my family and I will make a decision on my political future later this year.&quot;<br /><br />Hagel, 60, is probably best known to voters as a high-profile critic of the Bush administration dating to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. That criticism evolved into heated discordance in January when the Nebraska Republican called President Bush&#039;s plan to send an addition 21,500 U.S. troops to Iraq &quot;the most dangerous foreign policy blunder carried out since Vietnam.&quot;<br /><br />Citing the war, Social Security, trade and climate change among other issues, Hagel said, &quot;I believe it is in the interest of my Nebraska constituents and this country that I continue to work full time on these challenges.&quot;<br /><br />Hagel spoke at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, his alma mater.<br /><br />The senator is a decorated Vietnam War veteran who made millions in cellular phone business. A conservative, he has sometimes broken with the GOP leadership on foreign policy.<br /><br />Several prominent Republicans have already declared their intention to run for president and have taken the necessary steps such as hiring staff and raising millions for a White House bid. Among them former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, Sen. John McCain (news, bio, voting record), R-Ariz., and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney.<br />

				&quot; <br />Riches from Realtors. <br />One of the more active PACs is that of the National Association of Realtors, which donates ample money to members of Congress’ campaign committees via its Realtors PAC.<br />Realtors PAC last month gave $30,900 to federal candidates and committees — and the group was bipartisan in its giving. Democratic Rep. Jan Schakowsky, a liberal from Illinois, received a political contribution, as did Republican Rep. Barbara Cubin, a conservative from Wyoming.<br />New York Democratic Rep. Gregory W. Meeks, a senior member of the Financial Services Committee, received a $1,000 contribution for his campaign committee and $2,000 for his leadership organization, Build America PAC.<br />The Realtors PAC usually splits its political contributions nearly evenly between the two major parties. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the Realtors PAC gave $3.7 million to federal candidates in the 2006 election cycle — of which 51 percent went to Republicans and 49 percent to Democrats. In the 2004 cycle, the PAC gave 52 percent to Republicans and 47 percent to Democrats.<br /><br />Bankers’ Bankroll. <br />BankPac, the PAC of the American Bankers Association, kept busy in February, reporting donations of $127,500 to federal candidates and committees during the month.<br />A big chunk of this sum was given to national party committees. BankPac gave $15,000 apiece to the three major Republican committees — the Republican National Committee, the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee. It also gave $15,000 apiece to the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.<br />As one might expect, several recipients of BankPac campaign contributions sit on the Financial Services Committee. The leadership PACs of Republican Reps. Paul E. Gillmor and Deborah Pryce of Ohio and Bachus of Alabama each received $5,000 last month from BankPac.<br />&quot;<br />

				<br />March 20<br />Giuliani Top Choice Among Both Moderate, Conservative Republicans<br /><br />Gingrich, Romney do better among conservatives than moderates<br /><br />by Jeffrey M. Jones&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />GALLUP NEWS SERVICE<br /><br />PRINCETON, NJ -- With the 2008 Republican presidential field beginning to come into shape, there are still questions and apparent opportunities for a favorite &quot;conservative&quot; candidate to emerge. The three leading announced contenders -- Rudy Giuliani, John McCain, and Mitt Romney -- have taken stances in the past that are out of step, if not unpopular, with conservative voters, although all have taken recent steps to try to reassure conservatives. The key question is whether conservatives will be able to look past any differences they may have with these candidates and support one of them for the nomination -- or hope that a more solidly conservative candidate emerges from the back of the pack or enters the race. <br /><br />An analysis of Republicans&#039; primary nomination preferences in recent Gallup Polls show that while conservative Republicans are less likely to support Rudy Giuliani than liberal or moderate Republicans, the former New York City mayor is the clear leader among both groups. John McCain, who is in second among both groups, also fares slightly better among moderates than conservatives. Though well behind the two leaders, Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney are much more likely to be supported by conservatives than moderates and liberals. At the same time, conservative and moderate Republicans&#039; basic favorable ratings of Giuliani are highly positive and similar between the two groups, as are their ratings of McCain. Romney&#039;s favorable ratings are better among conservatives than moderate and liberal Republicans.<br /><br />Nomination Preference by Ideology<br />Gallup combined data from its last two Republican nomination trial heats, conducted Feb. 9-11, 2007, and Mar. 2-4, 2007, to get a better sense of how the candidates fare among ideological groups. Both polls showed Giuliani leading among all Republicans over McCain by a healthy margin, with Gingrich third. <br />Since relatively few Republicans identify as liberals, the responses of liberals and moderates are combined into one group. Republicans are about twice as likely to identify as conservative when asked about their ideological leanings than as either moderate or liberal. <br /><br />The analysis shows that Giuliani is the top choice among both conservative Republicans and liberal and moderate Republicans, though he has greater support among the latter group. McCain finishes second among both groups, and also polling slightly better among moderates and liberal Republicans.<br />&nbsp;<br />Preference for 2008 Republican Presidential Nomination, <br />Results by Ideology<br />Aggregated Data From Feb. 9-11, 2007, and March 2-4, 2007, Surveys&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Moderate/<br />Liberal Republicans&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conservative<br />Republicans&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Rudy Giuliani&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;48&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rudy Giuliani&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />John McCain&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John McCain&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Mitt Romney&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newt Gingrich&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />George Pataki&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mitt Romney&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Sam Brownback&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tommy Thompson&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Newt Gingrich&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Tommy Thompson&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />All others&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All others&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />No preference&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No preference&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />Giuliani and McCain are the only candidates with any significant support among moderate and liberal Republicans, with everyone else at 3% or less. On the other hand, Gingrich (14%) and Romney (8%) get higher support among conservative Republicans than liberal or moderate Republicans, but both trail the leading candidates by substantial margins among conservatives. <br /><br />Gingrich has yet to make his presidential intentions known, saying he will decide whether to formally enter the race later this year. His showing among conservative Republicans indicates he could be a factor in the race, particularly since Republican primary and caucus voters are mostly conservative in their ideological orientation.<br />If Gingrich does not enter the race, Romney and Giuliani may benefit more than the other Republican candidates among conservatives. When the data are re-calculated by substituting Gingrich supporters&#039; second choice for the nomination in place of their Gingrich vote, Giuliani&#039;s support among conservative Republicans increases to 43% (from 38%) and Romney pushes into the double digits at 11%. McCain&#039;s support is generally unchanged (21% compared to 20%) with Gingrich in the race. No other candidate gains more than a point in support among conservatives. <br />&nbsp;<br />Preference for 2008 Republican Presidential Nomination, <br />Results by Ideology (Without Gingrich)<br />Aggregated Data From Feb. 9-11, 2007, and March 2-4, 2007, Surveys&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Moderate/<br />Liberal Republicans&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conservative<br />Republicans&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Rudy Giuliani&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;49%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rudy Giuliani&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;43%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />John McCain&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;27%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John McCain&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Mitt Romney&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mitt Romney&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />George Pataki&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sam Brownback&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Sam Brownback&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duncan Hunter&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Tommy Thompson&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tommy Thompson&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tom Tancredo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />All others&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All others&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />No preference&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No preference&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />Favorable Ratings of Candidates<br />In addition to measuring the candidates&#039; current support for the nomination, Gallup has also asked Republicans for their overall opinions (favorable or unfavorable) of the leading contenders in the last two months. In general, Giuliani (80%) is viewed more favorably than McCain (68%) by Republicans regardless of their ideology. Eighty percent of both conservative and moderate Republicans have a favorable opinion of Giuliani. McCain&#039;s favorable ratings are 66% among moderate and liberal Republicans and 69% among conservative Republicans. <br /><br />While Republicans&#039; opinions of both Giuliani and McCain are similar by ideology, there is more variation in views of Romney, though the difference is largely due to conservatives being more familiar with him than moderates and liberals. Among conservative Republicans, 38% view Romney favorably, 13% unfavorably, and 49% do not know him well enough to give a rating. Among moderate and liberal Republicans, 23% have a favorable view, 11% an unfavorable one, and 66% cannot rate him.<br />&nbsp;<br />Favorable Ratings for 2008 Republican Presidential Nomination, <br />Results by Ideology<br />Aggregated Data From Feb. 9-11, 2007, and March 2-4, 2007, Surveys&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Favorable&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Un-favorable&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No opinion&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Rudy Giuliani&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />All Republicans&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Moderate/Liberal&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Conservative&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />John McCain&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />All Republicans&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;68&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Moderate/Liberal&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;66&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Conservative&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;69&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Mitt Romney&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />All Republicans&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;56&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Moderate/Liberal&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;66&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Conservative&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;49&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />Gingrich&#039;s favorable ratings were asked in just one poll, the March 2-4, 2007, poll. Fifty-four percent of Republicans viewed him favorably and 30% unfavorably in that poll, with 16% not having an opinion. Thus, Republicans give Gingrich the highest negative rating among the leading candidates. The data suggest that he is viewed much more favorably by conservative Republicans than by moderate and liberal Republicans so he may not be quite as vulnerable in the primaries as the overall data suggest. Gingrich would have a much harder time in the general election, though, as he is the only leading contender of either party who has a net negative favorable rating (29% favorable and 49% unfavorable) among all Americans. <br /><br />The favorable ratings show that conservative Republicans are apparently quite comfortable with both Giuliani and McCain -- both are given positive reviews by more than two-thirds of conservative Republicans. That would indicate that there may not be a substantial push to draft a conservative candidate among the Republican rank and file. However, that is not to say that if one emerges in the next several months that the candidate could not be competitive with the current group of frontrunners. <br /><br />Survey Methods<br />These results are based on telephone interviews with a randomly selected national sample of 849 Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, aged 18 and older, conducted Feb. 9-11, 2007, and Mar. 2-4, 2007.

				<br />New York Senate endorses Feb. 5 primary <br />By MARC HUMBERT, Associated Press Writer<br />Wed Mar 21<br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />The New York legislature overwhelmingly approved a measure Wednesday to move the state&#039;s presidential primary up to Feb. 5, a move designed to help its favorite political son and daughter — Rudy Giuliani and Hillary Rodham Clinton — in the 2008 race.<br /><br />Democratic Gov. Eliot Spitzer is expected to sign the measure that would put New York with California and a host of other states opting for the new Super Tuesday showdown.<br /><br />The New York primary had been set for March 4, but the earlier date was sought by Giuliani, the former New York City mayor, and also supported by Sen. Clinton. The two New Yorkers lead national polls in the race for the Republican and Democratic presidential nominations.<br /><br />&quot;Changing New York&#039;s primary date to February will provide voters with an early voice in the selection of presidential candidates and restore New York&#039;s input into choosing the most important office of our democracy,&quot; said state Senate Republican Majority Leader Joseph Bruno.<br /><br />Last week, Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed legislation shifting <strong>California&#039;s presidential primary date to Feb. 5, a move also being considered by New Jersey and Florida, among others.</strong><br /><br />In the Republican-led New York Senate, the measure was approved 59-1 with only Ruth Hassell-Thompson, a Bronx Democrat, voting against the measure.<br /><br />Hassell-Thompson said that while she understood that without the change the presidential candidates &quot;may decide that there&#039;s no need to even bother with the state of New York,&quot; she also felt &quot;the winter months are just more difficult&quot; for getting voters to the polls.<br /><br />The measure was approved 123-4 in the Democratic-controlled Assembly.<br /><br />** do you think this will improve voter turnout at all ? **<br /><br />http://www.lwvny.org/<br /><br /><br />http://www.politics1.com/calendar.htm<br /><br /><br />

				What I don&#039;t understand adout all this primary stuff is if a lot of the states move their primaries up to Feb 5th, which many seem to be doing, then the candidates will essentially be selected 8 months ahead of the actual election, does that mean 8 months of campaigning and 8 months worth of campaign contributions to make it to November?&nbsp; Or am I missing something?

				I guess the question in my mind is how many months should it take in 2008 for voters to make up their minds and for the candidates to be able to make their cases. 8 months seems like plenty. At some point we should get around to issues, but there is a lot of baseball between now and then.<br /><br />? is the gulf of tonkin anywhere near Iran ??&nbsp; &nbsp; :?<br /><br />** I often think of the SNL &#039;bat&#039; campaigns **<br /><br />anyways ...&quot;&quot;<br /><br />Asked whether they were entertained by the video, a narrow plurality of 44% of likely Democratic primary voters agreed, while 40% said it was not entertaining.<br /><br />While 34% of likely voting Democrats said it was a “mean–spirited attack on the Clintons,” another 19% said it was an “insightful commentary on an effort by the Clintons to dominate the Democratic Party presidential nomination process.” Other respondents said the ad was confusing or not very creative. Some complained that such attacks should be saved for the 2008 general election campaign against Republicans.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-D<br /><strong>A small percentage of Obama supporters (11%) said they were offended by the “Hillary 1984” video and were, as a result, more likely to support Clinton instead.</strong><br /><br /><br />There was a substantial difference in how respondents reacted, depending on their age. By a three-to-two margin, younger Democratic respondents (age 18-29) were more likely to say they thought the video was more of a <strong>mean-spirited </strong> attack on the Clintons than an insightful commentary. As respondents got older, the less pleased they were about the video. Among those age 65 and older, they were six times more likely to say the video was a mean-spirited attack.<br /><br /><br />Asked if the Obama campaign should repudiate the video and call for it to be taken down, 43% of Democrats agreed, while 38% disagreed, and 19% said they were unsure. The survey shows an Obama repudiation of the video would help him – 38% said such an act by Obama would make them more likely to support him, while 15% said a repudiation would make them less likely to support Obama.<br /><br /><br />Late Wednesday it was reported that a worker for an Internet development company that is under contract with the Obama campaign was responsible for the video. Until then, the identity of the video creator was unknown. Obama campaign officials had said they had no connection to the video and were in the dark as to who produced it. The producer of the video has been fired from his job. Zogby respondents did not know of the video producer’s identity when they answered questions in this survey, which was out of the field hours before the creator’s identity was made known.<br /><br /><br />The Zogby video survey demonstrates the power of online video in the world of politics today, as more than a third of likely Democratic voters – 37% – said they had seen the “Hillary 1984” parody video before taking the Zogby poll. The video only hit wide distribution on the Internet late Sunday night. One in three (33%) said they had also talked about the video with friends and colleagues before taking the Zogby survey.<br /><br />Interestingly, respondents, including Republicans, Democrats, and independents, were evenly split over whether such videos were a negative force on the political discourse of the U.S. While 45% said it was bad for the political discourse, 45% said it was not harmful. The other 10% were unsure.<br /><br />(3/22/2007) <br /><br />** been pondering what hosting of SNL would&nbsp; be like for Clinton and others ; skit suggestions are welcomed **<br /><br />

It divides the U.S. into six regions for purposes of determing the dates of presidential primaries and caucuses. It also sets up six dates (from March through June of presidential election years). It provides for a lottery to determine which region would vote on which of the six permitted dates.<br />The bill does not define “political party”, so it is unclear whether it would include parties other than the Democratic and Republican Parties. Also, the bill does not seem to consider that parties probably have a Freedom of Association to set their own caucus dates (for those states that use caucuses, not primaries). Party caucuses are not paid for by state governments, and consequently it is difficult to imagine that a court would let congress tell any party when to hold caucuses. Thanks to Tony Roza for this news.&quot;

Attempts by this page to link to that story in the Post have failed, but the May 1 2007 printed copy of Ballot Access News will report on this in detail.&#039;<br />

That allows them to take another $2,300 from each donor, but the money has to be returned if they don&#039;t win the nomination.<br /><br />Clinton&#039;s campaign often solicited the $4,600 donations, while Obama&#039;s campaign focused on recruiting small dollar donors. In the coming months, he can return to those donors and ask those who haven&#039;t maxed out to give more.<br /><br />Unlike Clinton, Obama says he doesn&#039;t take money from the <br /><strong>lobbyists or political action committees</strong> that are frequent contributors on other campaigns.<br /><br />Clinton campaign manager Patti Solis Doyle said, &quot;We are thrilled with our historic fundraising success and congratulate Senator Obama and the entire Democratic field on their fundraising, which demonstrates the overwhelming desire for change in our country.&quot;<br /><br />Obama was visiting Iowa Wednesday, holding an evening rally at a community college in Mason City.<br /><br />Among the other Democratic candidates, aides to former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards said his $14 million in new contributions included $1 million for the general election.<br /><br />New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson said he had raised $6 million and had more than $5 million cash on hand.<br /><br />Aides to Connecticut Sen. Chris Dodd said he raised more than $4 million and transferred nearly $5 million from his Senate campaign, for a total of $9 million in receipts and $7.5 million cash on hand. Delaware Sen. Joe Biden lagged behind, with his staff reporting that he had total receipts of nearly $4 million, nearly half of which was transferred from his Senate campaign account.<br /><br />Edwards, speaking to Davenport, Iowa, television station KWQC, complained that the pressure to raise huge sums was distorting the political process.<br /><br />&quot;We should actually be publicly financing these campaigns,&quot; Edwards said. &quot;We shouldn&#039;t be doing these money contests. They&#039;re not healthy, they&#039;re not good for democracy. Public financing is the answer. <br />&nbsp;:x<br /><br />&quot;While we still have this system, you have to compete the best way you can. What&#039;s clear is I think we&#039;re going to have at least three candidates on the Democratic side who have plenty of money to run a very serious campaign.&quot; <br /><br />Among the Republican candidates, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney was the top money-raiser with $23 million, another eye-catching sum that place him in the same league with Clinton and Obama and left his GOP rivals in the dust. <br /><br />Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani raised $15 million for the quarter, while Arizona Sen. John McCain (news, bio, voting record) posted $12.5 million. Giuliani leads the GOP field in national popularity polls, followed by McCain. <br /><br />** I would love to see the primaries shake things up, but maybe likely best bets would be<br /><br />Obama/Clinton; Edwards/Clinton; Giuliani/Thompson; McCain/Thompson;<br /><br />Do you have any favorite Veep choices?<br />Richardson could make a very interesting one.<br />Romney - just say No<br />**<br />

				Title: <strong>long-term fiscal policy reform Re: NY NY 2008</strong><br />

				<br />http://concordcoalition.org/press/2007/0423release-trusteesreport.htm<br />&nbsp;:mrgreen:<br /><br />CONCORD COALITION SAYS THAT SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE TRUSTEES REPORT DESERVES ATTENTION ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL<br /><br />WASHINGTON -- With today&#039;s release of the annual Social Security and Medicare Trustees&#039; Reports confirming the unsustainable outlook for the federal government’s two largest programs, The Concord Coalition urged presidential candidates to make long-term fiscal policy reform one of their top priorities.<br /><br />&quot;This report should be required reading on the campaign trail. Anyone who is serious about becoming our next President must be prepared to confront the long-term fiscal challenge and be willing to lead a national dialogue on how to deal with it,&quot; said Robert L. Bixby, Executive Director of The Concord Coalition.&nbsp; <br /><br />&quot;It is understandable that Democrats and Republicans will have different perspectives on the specifics of any reform plan. This report demonstrates, however, that the first step is to <strong>reject the ‘Do Nothing Plan.’ </strong> The debate should be about realistic options, not about who can promise the most without asking anyone to give anything up. In effect, those who pledge not to consider any benefit reductions or new funding are pledging to stand by and watch as Social Security and Medicare go over a fiscal cliff.&quot; Bixby said.<br /><br />According to the Trustees report, the cost of Social Security and Medicare will roughly double from 7 percent of the economy today to 14 percent by 2040. To put that number in context, if the federal government spent 14 percent of GDP on these two programs today they would consume <strong>about 80 percent of all revenues.</strong> <br /><br /><strong>Despite the attention focused on when the Social Security and Medicare Part A trust funds become &quot;insolvent,&quot; The Concord Coalition again warned that trust fund solvency is a poor indicator of the fiscal outlook for these programs. </strong> <br /><br />&quot;The magnitude of our long-term fiscal challenge should not be minimized by trust-fund accounting. This indicator not only misleads the public about the timing and magnitude of the looming fiscal burden, it says nothing about these programs&#039; impact on national savings and generational equity. Trust fund solvency also says nothing about how society will meet the growing fiscal burden reflected in these projections. Because the trust funds are primarily an accounting device for keeping track of the programs&#039; claims on general revenues, their existence does not ease the burden of paying future benefits,&quot; said Bixby. <br /><br />&quot;These programs must not be viewed in isolation, either from each other or from the overall federal budget. What matters fiscally and economically is their combined total cost. Reform efforts will need to either reduce costs or raise revenues to pay for them. Those are the choices that must be confronted,&quot; Bixby said.<br /><br />###<br />

				**<br />a promotion of a centrist - unified ticket to challenge the partisan ones.<br />Some rather interesting choices of independents. And some interesting suggested pairings -<br />Gore: Welch<br />Webb: Powell<br />**<br /><br />If you could also put together the best of both parties, who would you choose? Well, now&#039;s your chance. <br />Go to http://www.unity08.com/dream_ticket <br />to create your own bipartisan presidential team. Just pick two names from the lists provided, or feel free to suggest potential candidates people who aren&#039;t on the lists. You can even make your own bumper sticker or campaign button for your favorite candidates.<br />&nbsp;<br />In the bickering, name-calling, blame game of politics today, the concept of bipartisanship has been lost - and everything we love about America is in peril. Washington politicians simply can&#039;t solve any tough problems because they can&#039;t even talk to one another. They&#039;re so polarized that they&#039;re paralyzed!<br />&nbsp;<br />The concept of a Unity Ticket - one Republican, one Democrat, or Independent in whatever order - may sound very different. But, in fact the only way Washington has ever solved major problems is when the two parties work together. It&#039;s called bipartisanship and it&#039;s as old as America.<br />&nbsp;<br />That&#039;s why Unity08 has set out to place a third ticket on the ballot in November 2008. A ticket nominated directly by the people, and elected to the White House by the people.<br />&nbsp;<br />Is that really such a revolutionary thought? Two people of different parties deciding they can work together for the future of our country.<br />&nbsp;<br />I hope you will name your own Dream Ticket too. It&#039;s our opportunity to get involved and help shake up the system. <br />Do it by visiting http://www.unity08.com/dream_ticket <br />and give the media and the politicians something revolutionary to think about.<br />&nbsp;<br />Each day Unity08 will post a selection of Dream Tickets on the Unity08 website, along with the reasons behind the choices.<br />&nbsp;<br />Be creative! Our country needs it. Be bold! Our country needs it. Be bipartisan. Our country needs it.<br />&nbsp;<br />Thank you!<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />P.S. Remember, pick one Democrat and one Republican, or one Independent in any order you wish. But please make your choice today.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>P.P.S. Should you be a Delegate?&nbsp; Unity08 Delegates will participate in the first ever online nominating process for a bipartisan presidential ticket in 2008.</strong><br /><br />&nbsp;http://www.unity08.com/delegate_quiz<br /><br />
