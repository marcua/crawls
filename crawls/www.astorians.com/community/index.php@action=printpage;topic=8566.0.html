				This is a real coup for RWG&#039;s campaign, though.&nbsp; It should bolster his standing with the conservative base, who has hesitated to embrace him due to some of his more socially liberal stances on the issues.

				I wish someone would ask Rudy how he feels about Pat Robertson&#039;s insight to 9/11.<br /><br />Pat Robertson&#039;s quote:<br />&quot;We have allowed rampant secularism and occult, et cetera, to be broadcast on television. We have permitted somewhere in the neighborhood of 35 to 40 million unborn babies to be slaughtered in our society. We have a Court that has essentially stuck its finger in God&#039;s eye and said, &#039;We&#039;re going to legislate you out of the schools, we&#039;re going to take your Commandments from off the courthouse steps in various states, we&#039;re not going to let little children read the Commandments of God, we&#039;re not going to let the Bible be read -- no prayer in our schools.&#039; We have insulted God at the highest levels of our government. And, then we say &#039;why does this happen?&#039; Well, why its happening is that God Almighty is lifting His protection from us.&quot; (in response to the 9/11 attacks)

				I can only hope that having Robertson the homo-phobe can only make Rudi a less appealing candidate than he already is<br /><br />If he rides &quot;I was mayor during 9/11&quot; to the White House, this country deserves what it gets.

				Yes, Robertson is repugnant.&nbsp; But this is still a sound strategy.&nbsp; You guys are unlikely to vote for Rudy in the Republican primary (or, dare-I-say, to vote for any Republican in the general election).&nbsp; So to alienate you is not a problem.&nbsp; But Rudy has been met with general skepticism from religious conservatives, a crucial part of the Republican base.&nbsp; This endorsement should warm them up to his campaign.&nbsp; And if he were to win the primary, he&#039;d shift to the center for the general election to pick off the swing voters.

				Robertson is wacko even by evangelical standards.&nbsp; But with a lot of evangelicals having second thoughts about rt-wing politics, the remaining base of true Bushie believers (looking for someone to fill Bush&#039;s shoes) is more wacko than ever.<br /><br />Still, curiouser and curiouser.&nbsp; I suppose Robertson wants the meanest of the bunch.

				The evangelicals are not going to the left in great numbers, but a lot of them are either dropping out of politics or moving toward the center.&nbsp; There&#039;s a lot of feeling that social-justice and environmental issues are at least as important as &quot;pelvic&quot; issues (Mike Huckabee seems to fit this mood).<br /><br />Then there are the hard-liners who would like a hard-line third-party candidate--maybe one will emerge.<br /><br />Evangelicals were never a monolith and they&#039;re even less of a monolith now.<br /><br />But what Robertson seems to want is someone to lead a Christian crusade against the Muslim infidel.&nbsp; The two real bellicose front-runners are Giuliani and Romney.&nbsp; And Giuliani is the only one of the two who is even nominally a Christian.

They&#039;re <strong>all</strong> opportunists. It&#039;s why they run. At least the ones who are real contenders.<br /><br />Rudy&#039;s making an interesting tactical move to shore up support from the conservative base. I question Robertson&#039;s relevance and/or influence anyway; he seems to have become more marginalized in the past several years.<br /><br />It signals to me that Rudy&#039;s been quietly making a case for his electability. IN other words, it&#039;s like he&#039;s sitting down with party big shots and saying, &quot;you know I&#039;m the only one who can beat Hilary in November 2008.&quot; Nevermind that he see eye to eye with the more conservative wing, like Robertson. That&#039;s the art of politics.<br /><br />It&#039;s definitely been an interesting to see the jockeying in the run up to the primaries -- for both parties.
