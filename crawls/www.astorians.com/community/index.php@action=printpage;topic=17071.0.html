				Don&#039;t know what area of Astoria you&#039;re interested in, but I belong to the Rock on 31st Street, just off Ditmars Blvd. - right<br />near the Ditmars train station.<br /><br />They&#039;re running some specials now for the new year. It&#039;s much pricier than PF, but it&#039;s a better gym. Lots of cardio and weight<br />machines along with free weights, a rock climbing wall, boxing ring and two studios. Classes range from belly dancing to zumba.<br />Trainers are all certified and it&#039;s very clean and well maintained. <br /><br />You mentioned PF is crowded. Every gym is crowded now with the new year&#039;s resolution crowd. That&#039;ll thin out in a few weeks.<br />And no offense to anyone who just joined or wants to join a gym now -&nbsp; I was one of those January beginners too!<br /><br />If you go to the Rock, they&#039;ll usually give you a three-day pass to try it out. I think most gyms will. k

				I go to NYSC mainly because of the multiple locations and group classes, but it is pricey. <br /><br />I would say if the locations are not an issue for you, take advantage of the initial free trial memberships and see what you like. Most gyms do a week or two trial to check the place out. I have a friend who does Planet Fitness, and it is much cheaper to join than NYSC or the rock from what I understand.

				I go to NYSC and while I&#039;m happy with the equipment and the ppl there, I agree that it&#039;s pricey. I&#039;ve done a few classes there and they&#039;ve been pretty good as well.<br /><br />I&#039;m looking to switch to another gym since I no longer live near NYSC, and the &quot;commute&quot; is annoying. Anyone have any experience with Matrix on Ditmars and 43rd? Is it cheaper than NYSC? I&#039;m just looking for a place with a decent weight room and machines... not really big into classes, although they&#039;re nice to do once in a while.

				&nbsp;:-)<br />I&#039;m a Matrix member for the past 3 years. The staff is pretty cool (they always say hi and give me a towel when I walk in) and it&#039;s a very large space and never too crowded.They put in ALOT of new cardio machines last year&nbsp; and I never have to wait for a treadmill which is a big plus for me.What made me join in the first place was they let me try the club for 2 weeks to see if I liked it before I had to fork over any money. I pay $55 per month and I was told as long as I stay a member my rate will never be increased and so far they stuck to their word.

				I&#039;ve been a member of synergy on Broadway.&nbsp; It&#039;s clean and the machines always work.&nbsp; Depends on what&#039;s most convenient to your location.&nbsp; Joining a gym that is too far is just an excuse not to go.<br /><br />Regarding enrollment costs, my insurance (Oxford) covers $400 towards gym membership every 6 months as long as you go 50 times or something like that. Everyone should check to see if their health insurance covers the cost of your gym membership. It&#039;s a little hidden benefit that not everyone realizes is there.

				I&#039;ve been a member of Matrix for the LONGEST..(my member # is only 4 digits long and I think their up to 4 or 5 digit #&#039;s now)..... and although it may be a bit pricey..... its well worth it!!! The people that work there are great &amp; the trainers are there for you if you need them. I&#039;m in the process of looking for an apt., (which is VERY difficult.... but thats another story all together) &amp; the fact that I&#039;m a member of this gym (aside from some other reasons) is keeping me in the Ditmars neighborhood.<br />Anyone looking for a gym to attend, should go take a look at Matrix....... try it out (since they let you) then make your choice.<br /><br />good luck!!

				I used to be a member of the NYSC and was very happy with it, but it got too expensive for me.&nbsp; For the last year I&#039;ve been a member of Astoria Sports Complex (ASC) which is $99 per year (that&#039;s right just $99 per year).&nbsp; ASC has decent machines and is clean.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t have&nbsp; personal entertainment systems (i.e., TVs on machines), and the locker room is beyond bare bones and you have to give a dollar deposit to get a towel (which you get back when you return the towel).&nbsp; It is a decent and cheap gym. I go most week mornings from 7AM-8AM and unlike NYSC, it isn&#039;t crowded (yay!).&nbsp; All in all, you get more than what you pay for at ASC.

				I agree&nbsp; Astoria sports complex for the money , $99 dollars a year is well worth it .&nbsp; They dont dazzle you with all this high tech stuff and u rnt gonna get huge flat screen tvs or built in ipods on machines to plug in your headphones . But if u wanna work out and do your thing , this is the cheapest priced gym that has everything .

				Having been a member of both &quot;budget&quot; gyms in Astoria, ASC for 3 or 4 years and Planet Fitness for over a year now, I will say that I&#039;m seriously considering going back to ASC, even though it&#039;s not nearly as convenient, location-wise.&nbsp; Even though I&#039;m only paying $10 a month for PF, I like to hit the gym on the way home, so I can take my time and exercise (those of you who have met me, stop snickering, I DO exercise) and get in the workout I want.&nbsp; Unfortunately, PF has gotten to the point where I can&#039;t stand setting foot in there after work, because I watch people sit on machines reading a book or magazine and not actually, you know, exercising.&nbsp; Hell, I watched a couple sit on two of the stationary bikes, holding hands, barely pedaling and leaining over to make out.&nbsp; So now I go in the morning, but I don&#039;t have a full hour and a half in the morning to get in a real decent workout.&nbsp; <br />ASC is bare bones, but their layout and equipment (at least in the weight room) is better than PF.&nbsp; Plus, if I&#039;m feeling up to it, I can hit the batting cages at ASC after a workout.&nbsp; I&#039;m giving PF another couple months in hopes that they either expant or open another location nearby, otherwise, I think I&#039;m heading back to ASC.

				I like the Rock quite a lot.&nbsp; I used to be a member through WellQuest, a third party company that offered discounts through your health insurance.&nbsp; I was able to join the Rock for $57/month.&nbsp; Sometime recently, WellQuest went bankrupt and didn&#039;t inform any customers.&nbsp; The Rock called me up months later and informed me.&nbsp; The best part was they&#039;ve kept the rate the same and it&#039;s month to month.&nbsp; It&#039;s a great club, very clean and big.&nbsp; The classes are good and a lot of fun, with great instructors.&nbsp; I&#039;d definitely recommend the place.&nbsp; And if you&#039;re into boxing, they have a whole ring.&nbsp; They also have a rock climbing wall.&nbsp; And free babysitting for the kiddies.

				True once they put in all those meters by ASC its been impossible to park . Fri nights and weekends its very tough too with alot of people going out to eat and to the movies .&nbsp; But for the price and if you can get there , cant beat this gym . I looked into planet fitness but getting bagel pizza and tootsie rolls after a work out for free is kinda lame for a gym to be handing out .

				I&#039;m not a member of Evolution, but I would recommend it. I checked it out about 2 years ago, just<br />before they opened. Nice layout, plenty of room, good variety of equipment. If I remember correctly,<br />one of the owners used to be affiliated with The Rock, which I belong to. Or it may be that the layout<br />was designed by the same team that designed the Rock. <br /><br />But I also liked the fact that when I told them I was just curious and was a Rock member, they didn&#039;t <br />mind showing me around and didn&#039;t give a hard sell. Just asked that I&#039;d give them a thumbs up if<br />I knew anyone looking for a club in that part of Astoria. <br /><br />If I lived closer to there, I would probably be a member. And their fee was reasonable - maybe $500 or $600<br />for the year. <br /><br />Anyway, just another option - luckily now we have many in Astoria. It wasn&#039;t always that way!<br />

				My fiance and I left Dolphin Gym a year ago and joined Club Fitness on Broadway. I think that it is probably the best gym/health club in all of Astoria!<br /><br />~There are a lot of pros to joining:<br /><br />The gym is a LOT bigger then it looks from the outside so don&#039;t let that fool you! It has 3 floors and each one has various workout rooms and equipment. There is one HUGE floor dedicated to weights, 3 separate cardio areas/rooms, a personal training room, and a cafe area. You NEVER have to wait to use weights, machines, or other equipment, and almost all of the cardio machines are equipped with TV monitors. They also have a room dedicated to their spin class as well as a separate room where they hold various other classes. I have to say that Club Fitness has some GREAT classes, you never run out of things to do that&#039;s for sure. <br />If that wasn&#039;t enough, they also have a cafe area with tables and a flat screen, they have their own Spa where you can get facials, massages, pedicures, etc., and 2 separate rooms with tanning beds. I also heard that they offer daycare, but have never used it personally.<br />I also need to mention that their locker rooms are simply amazing! they are by far the cleanest I have EVER been in and have a personal attendant that is there all the time to clean up after the slobs lol.. The locker rooms also have private showers, a separate area with the toilet stalls and sinks, a steam room, jacuzzi, and a sauna! Right outside from both the men&#039;s and women&#039;s locker rooms there is a lounge area with couches where you can relax, watch TV, read a magazine, or talk on your cell phone.<br /><br />~The biggest cons about joining Club Fitness:<br /><br />The monthly membership price is REALLY expensive! It&#039;s around $90 a month for a membership, that&#039;s the highest i have seen for Astoria gyms! If you prepay a year you can get a really good deal though, that&#039;s what we did.&nbsp; They even threw in 2 free months since we had 2 months left on our Dolphin contract, I thought that was pretty cool. <br />The other con is gym hours, they are not open 24 hours which is kind of a bummer sometimes. <br /><br />In my opinion, the pros outweigh the cons if you can afford the membership fee. I workout 5 days a week so for me it&#039;s worth it paying the extra money for the perks they offer!

				Just FYI - The Rock is having a special for this month. $63 to register, $63 per month - no commitment.<br /><br />That&#039;s a lot cheaper than the $85 to $90 it was costing per month and I know the initiation fee was high.<br /><br />I&#039;m a member, but am not pushing it or anything.

				Need to rant a bit. Dolphin has totally changed in recent weeks. They&#039;ve taken away 1/3 of the space for weights and added boxing rings for mixed martial arts, which I&#039;ve yet to see anyone use. The one small room for stretching and classes is now the free weight room - so there is no place to stretch anymore. Even though the price is right, I need to switch. Club Fitness is closest to me and sounds good.

				any opinions on Ultimate Fitness (was BQE Fitness). planning on joining there after the holidays for a 3-month crash course for my wedding. it&#039;s the closest gym to me and rates are reasonable ($30/month no contract). next closest would be NYSC or PF on Steinway.<br /><br />seems pretty no-frills, but at least some of the gear has been updated since new ownership.

BQE is mentioned a few times and seems to be recommended. <br /><br />I go to NYSC and am happy with it.&nbsp; $76month for passport membership, but I believe it&#039;s much cheaper if you limit yourself to one location.<br /><br />PF is cheap, but I know someone with a membership who doesn&#039;t go because it&#039;s too crowded.. and that problem will only get worse in January.<br />
