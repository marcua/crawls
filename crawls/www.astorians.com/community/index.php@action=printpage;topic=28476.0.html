				I saw a Liquidation/Closing sign at Fresh Start Market on 23rd Avenue.&nbsp; Is the natural food store indeed going out of business? :sad:

				Not exactly--they&#039;re renovating/changing the format a bit.&nbsp; I don&#039;t remember exactly to what.&nbsp; It&#039;ll stay open on Tuesdays for the Hellgate CSA pickups.

				Somebody told me they are renovating it to be a cafe.&nbsp; I never liked this place too much either. The prices were kind of high.&nbsp; I hardly ever bought anything in there.&nbsp; I hope the cafe is better than the store and not too expensive. I also love buying my fruits and vegetables at California Farmer&#039;s Market.&nbsp; They have some very good prices and the fruit is very good
