				Hey guys, <br /><br />So here is the deal. My roommates are cool, but one has a serious video game addiction problem. So I am taking measures now of my 50&quot; tv which I was kind enough to put in the living room (it wont fit in my bedroom) and all he does is play Xbox 360 and i am just tired of it since talking did not help and all i want is to watch the news at least once a day right? So to teach him a lesson and also cause i could use the cash, i am selling my beautiful fine working Vizio tv. Let him get his own damn tv right? <br /><br />So any event here is the tv. There is only one flight of stairs you must walk down, a rather short flight consisting of 12 steps. If you have a car and can help me, i can help you down the stairs with it. The tv is about 120-130 lbs and 50&quot; in screen size (diagonal). It is about 2 yrs old and has not been used much at all because i used to have it in my bedroom in my old house and would work late most times and never get to watch it cause i was so tired. <br /><br />Looking to get rid ASAP and for cheap....paid close to $2,000.<br /><br />Looking for $700 cash only. <br /><br />Thanks. <br /><br />(http://i56.photobucket.com/albums/g170/Quoth2006/IMG_3134.jpg)<br /><br />(http://i56.photobucket.com/albums/g170/Quoth2006/IMG_3140.jpg)<br /><br />(http://i56.photobucket.com/albums/g170/Quoth2006/IMG_3141.jpg)<br /><br />(http://i56.photobucket.com/albums/g170/Quoth2006/B45E7E5A211A47F7.jpg)&nbsp; the flight of stairs <br />
