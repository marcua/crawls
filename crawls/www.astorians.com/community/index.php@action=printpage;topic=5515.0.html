				Is there an accepted set of rules for walking on the sidewalk? I&#039;ve always felt that sidewalks should be treated like roads. For example, if you live in the United States, you should walk on the right side of the sidewalk (like you drive on the right side of the road), pass on the left, &amp; if you have to stop, move over so you aren&#039;t blocking the progress of others.<br /><br />Obviously, in the UK &amp; other left-side-driving countries, everyone should also walk on the left side of the sidewalk.<br /><br />Do these simple rules exist only in my own head, or do other people know them too?<br /><br />----------<br /><br />My good friend Hans once wrote up the following Ten Commandments for the Sidewalk:<br /><br />And Yahweh spake unto Moses, and said &quot;Heed my laws, for they shall guide you in the great cities unto the end of days.&quot; And He wrote His commandments on two slabs of pavement. But lo, they were too heavy for Moses, so Yahweh abbreviated His Word somewhat.<br /><br />1. Upon the sidewalk, thou shalt behave as though it were the road, and lanes shall be established, that the hasty may have dominion over the slow, that those who travel in opposite directions may not come into contact with one another, and that those who power-walk might safely bypass those who gawk.<br /><br />2. Thou shalt not come to a cessation of motion in the sidewalk, for it angers Yahweh God, and He shalt smite thee. And if He does not, He shalt permit others on the sidewalk to act as His hands, and they shalt smite thee in His name.<br /><br />3. Thou shalt attend to thine surroundings and be not distracted by godless pursuits. Those who useth their cell phones with great vigor while remaining unaware of those around them arouse the displeasure of Yahweh God, and He shalt smite them, and inflict greater roaming charges upon them, because they are bastards. Those who draggeth wheeled carrying containers must also pay heed, that they not entangle the legs of those around them, and cause grief. They shall inherit a beating.<br /><br />4. Do not be fooled by the moving walkway, the escalator, and yea, even the stairwell of old, for the law of Yahweh applies to them as well. Let the slothful stand aside that the hasty may take advantage of technology&#039;s boon.<br /><br />5. Behold the stairwell, for it may contain a banister dividing it in two equal parts. Proceed on the right side, much as thou wouldst drive thine car on the highway, unless thou drivest in the British fashion, which is an abomination unto the eyes of the Lord.<br /><br />6. Control thine progeny, for they must learn of the law of Yahweh. Should they lose direction and wander into the path of the opposing traveller, they may be trampled, and justice will be done, yea, even amidst the wailing of the infants. Yahweh invented the leash for a reason, and His reasons are just.<br /><br />7. Control thine elderly, for they move with lethargy and unseeing eyes, and will confound the feet of the traveller with walkers and canes. Yahweh will recall them unto His hand, should they cause one to miss the 9:05 train.<br /><br />8. Blessed are the jaywalkers, but accursed be those who jaywalk unprofessionally, disregarding the flow of vehicular traffic around them. They shalt be impacted upon by the bumper of the taxi, which shall act as the hand of Yahweh God, even if it is driven by a Pakistani.<br /><br />9. Tourists, respect the cities that thou visiteth. Respect too those who dwell in those cities, for they know the laws of the sidewalk that Yahweh has set down in concrete. Respect, as thou respecteth the laws of thine own dwelling, or thou shalt be smitten with yon two-by-four.<br /><br />10. Thou that dwelleth in country, in greener pastures, in the valley of the shadow of rurality, that know not the sidewalk and its ways, Yahweh says unto thee, Get With The Program, bitches.<br /><br />Amen.

				Glad you liked it.&nbsp; Sometimes I&#039;m tempted to print the Commandments on flyers &amp; then hand them out to tourists coming up the escalator at the Times Square subway station.

				I&#039;m a huge fan of natural consequences for those that are not aware of their environment following sidewalk rules, and I make few allowances...so if you stop on 34st street, because you are in awe of the empire state building, and you happen to do this in front of me, guess what...it might hurt.

				When we had the ice a few weeks back, I was struggling to get around on crutches as well.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t fun.<br /><br />Even less fun?&nbsp; When I had tourists in front of me in Times Square (where I work) who were <em>in my way</em>.<br /><br />Yo.&nbsp; Dudes.&nbsp; If the girl <em>on the crutches</em> is going faster than you are?&nbsp; You got problems.&nbsp; That&#039;s all.<br /><br />(And don&#039;t get me started on the person who decided to choose the only non-iced spot on the sidewalk as their smoking location right as I was trying to get into the building, who then looked at me blankly like &quot;What?&nbsp; You can&#039;t go on the big sheet of sidewalk ice with crutches?&quot;)

If you&#039;re not going to actively move up the steps, you stay to the right. People who break this rule are seriously asking for it. I think in DC - where the entire Metro system depends on very long escalators - it&#039;s a law. If you stand on the left, someone will hurt you.<br /><br />As George Costanza would say, &quot;WE&#039;RE LIVING IN A SOCIETY!&quot;

				*laugh*<br /><br />That&#039;s awesome. And as someone who moved from a left-driving country to this one, I would concur that those rules definitely exist. I did spend a few confused months standing on the wrong side of an escalator by accident, or walking into people before I figured out what was going on (not driving meant I hadn&#039;t really adjusted to the right side thing at all!)! <br /><br />

				That was pretty funny. <br /><br />As an ex-rural resident, these rules are pretty obvious at first site. All it takes is a little observation and, more importantly, consideration for other people. Those that flagrantly disobey these &quot;rules&quot; are just simply inconsiderate (making it obvious in their disregard of those around them, be it through sidewalk etiquette, dog-poop on the sidewalk, trash in the streets, etc, etc, ad nauseum).
