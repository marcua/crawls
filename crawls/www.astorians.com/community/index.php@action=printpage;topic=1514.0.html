				I don&#39;t think that your friend should have any problems. Outside of two or three bars in L.I.C., all the rest are straight. In fact, that&#39;s how I would go about it. I would look up all the gay/lesbian bars in the area and then by process of elimination know that all the rest are hetero-friendly... well...very much like the rest of society.<br /><br />Welcome to the forums!<br /><br />Your straight-friendly friend,<br />-zeno

				Astoria is not exactly overrun with homosexuals, if that&#39;s what you mean.&nbsp; I wouldn&#39;t worry about finding &quot;straight friendly&quot; places to go here.&nbsp; We do, in fact, live in a straight friendly world.&nbsp; Tell your friend that as long as he doesn&#39;t wear tight t-shirts with leather pants and a bandanna in his back pocket, he shouldn&#39;t have to worry about any abominations bothering him. If he&#39;s still worried, he can go to Colorado , Texas, or Utah.<br /><br />&nbsp;:roll:<br /><br />

Within a three block radius of me there are about 11 &quot;straight&quot; bars, therefore I cannot believe that he would have such a hard time finding a &quot;straight&quot; bar to suite his needs. I do hope that he finds a good spot and has a great time meeting new &quot;straight&quot; friends. A joke for everyone, &quot;straight&quot; and &quot;gay&quot;, what is the difference between a &quot;straight&quot; guy and a &quot;gay&quot; guy?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />A SIX PACK!!

				Thanks for the advice, guys!&nbsp; Process of elimination seems like the best way of going about this.&nbsp; If it doesn&#39;t exist, maybe someone should make a website listing all the straight bars in Astoria?&nbsp; Seems like a good idea to save everyone else of the same hassle.&nbsp; Thanks again!

				What does one mean by Straight Friendly?&nbsp; Well it doesn&#39;t matter.&nbsp; Maybe we can categorize a few bars for your friend:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; The Quays - a great Irish pub on 45th Street and 30th Avenue.&nbsp; Specializing in third drink kickbacks, crazy irish folk getting piss drunk and singing along with the REAL JUKEBOX.&nbsp; Occasional live music and the best escargot in town.&nbsp; Average price for a real drink: $3.50<br /><br />2.&nbsp; Caprice: Astoria Boulevard Train Station.&nbsp; High brow, allowing age groups from 23 to 35.&nbsp; Always a big huge bouncer at the door and plenty of barely clad (although untouchable by any mere male mortal) ladies inside.&nbsp; Seems to have hip-hop overtones, while generally being a middle to upper Astoria white crowd.&nbsp; Average price for a real drink $13<br /><br />3.&nbsp; The Beer Garden.&nbsp; The place to go when your feeling college dorm living nestalgia.&nbsp; Definitely hit this place as early as you can to avoid the line and maybe even get some serious croation cooking in the basement restaurant (get the beef goulash!).&nbsp; Restaurant closes early on Fridays and Saturday nights, but they have grilled food all night long.&nbsp; Don&#39;t bother in the winter and fall though - the party is outside beyond the bar where 100 picnic tables great you.&nbsp; Plenty of room to mingle and meet you match, or just a hookup (relive those college days!)&nbsp; Average price for a real drink: Who knows?&nbsp; Go for a pitcher of beer $12/pitcher.<br /><br />&nbsp;
