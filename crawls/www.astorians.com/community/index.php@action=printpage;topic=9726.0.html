				Hello there - I know that once upon a time, there was a Manos Papaya on Steinway and 30th, and it was truly heartbreaking when it closed.&nbsp; However, when walking home from the 30th Avenue station yesterday I noticed that a new one will be opening on 30th Ave between 30th and 31st Streets (same block as 7-11 and new Sai Organics, aka &quot;the place that sucks because it took over the amazing Keystone Diner&quot;)...<br /><br />Anyway. There is an awning and everything for those of you who walk by there and want to take a look.&nbsp; I think it took the place of an old, decrepit, scary lawyer&#039;s office that was long past its prime even when <em>I </em> moved in around the corner --&nbsp; 3 1/2 years ago!&nbsp; Very exciting!

				I noticed this comming home from Opa the other day. I remember reading in a thread somewhere on here AGES ago that they were going to open again there, but I went walking around looking for it and I saw no sign of construction or anything, so I figured it was false info. But the board does not lie after all!!!! yay:) I miss the coconut drinks

				This is terrific news, although my doctor might not agree. I also read looong ago about it supposedly happening but had assumed it fell through or was wrong. Hot dog!

				I haven&#039;t been by there in a few weeks.&nbsp; But has there been any news or sign of activity?&nbsp; I found an older thread which said that they first put their coming soon sign up in April of 2007, well before even the 7-11 came to be.&nbsp; I used to love the Gray&#039;s on 72nd and Broadway when I was in school, and Manos was comparable.&nbsp; I miss it.

				I live right near it and my mom - who&#039;s home during the day - told me she never<br />sees any activity there at all. No one coming/going, no work seems to be taking place.<br /><br />So I wouldn&#039;t hold my breath........

I passed by it with friends more than once to see if it was open yet - but there really hasn&#039;t been a sign of life in there in months.
