				Ok, right off the bat, no my building does not have bedbugs (or bugs of any kind, actually.) I&#039;ve been here 3 years and I&#039;ve never had a problem. I promise! (There are people here on Astorians who can vouch for my honesty :) )<br /><br />I am getting rid of my bed because a friend got a new (bigger) bed from her friend (who moved overseas), and my friend passed her bed on to me. The mattress/box spring I&#039;m giving away is on the softer side, and I have a bad back, which is why I&#039;m taking my friend&#039;s second-hand (but firmer) mattress/box spring. I also have one of those metal frames that come when you buy a bed that you can have as well.<br /><br />I bought the bed at Sleepy&#039;s in August 2005, and it&#039;s always been covered with a mattress pad, and for a while, both the mattress and box spring were zipped up in some hypo-allergenic bag type thing in addition to the mattress pad. This is also a pet-free building, and personally, I&#039;m a pretty clean person, and you don&#039;t have to worry about any ickiness.<br /><br />I&#039;m at Steinway Street and 21st Ave., and you&#039;d have to come pick it up. I can help you get it downstairs though. If no one comes to get it by tomorrow night, it&#039;ll have to go out on the curb since it&#039;s in the empty bedroom right now and my new roommate is moving in on Monday. I&#039;d hate to toss it since it seems like such a waste, so if you need a bed and can get it to your place, email me ASAP! (My email is in my profile, or click the envelope under my picture.)
