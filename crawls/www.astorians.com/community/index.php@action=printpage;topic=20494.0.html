				Cool. And after it&#039;s built, can we spend $4mil re-naming it??<br /><br />Isn&#039;t there already bike and pedestrian access to Randall&#039;s Island on the Tribo...&nbsp; Oopps, sorry.&nbsp; I meant the RFK *makes obscene hand gesture* Bridge??

				There&#039;s a pedestrian crossing over the Triboro, but it&#039;s technically illegal to ride a bike over it.&nbsp; It also has stairways at regular intervals.<br /><br />As a biker, I think this is excellent news.

				This would all be really cool if the city had the money to do it and wasn&#039;t closing 12 high schools in poor neighborhoods to save money and raising the MTA fares to get more money and all the other austerity measures they&#039;re implementing. I just don&#039;t see where the money for this is coming from when our schools and our public transportation system&#039;s infrastructure is crumbling. Seems like the priorities in the city budget are really messed up. Yes, it&#039;s cool but I think there are things that this city NEEDS as opposed to things it WANTS that should be taken care of first. I guess it falls in line with the whole charge it now and pay for it later mindset that got us into this country-wide economic slump.

				I don&#039;t think this actually affects Astoria at all. The Bikeway will be built under the Hell Gate on the Randall&#039;s Island side, eventually connecting to the South Bronx. This seems like a good thing for people living in the Bronx.

				&quot; It also has stairways at regular intervals.&quot;<br /><br />Speaking of stairways and bicycles...how would you get up to this Bikeway? <br /><br />I think the noise and vibration of a freight train passing overhead would be unnerving the first time you experienced it.

				The stairways on the triboro ped/bike way have metal chute-thingies laid over them at the side (maybe 6&quot; wide) to allow bicyclists to walk their bikes up &amp; down the stairs. I believe (could be wrong!) that cycling is legal on the foot bridge, but you&#039;re supposed to walk your bike on the part between the stairways (which is fairly narrow and has tight spots where you go around the stanchions). However I have never seen anyone do this (walk their bike through that part), everyone rides.<br /><br />Regarding the Hell Gate path - from the pretty limited amount of info in the news article, it sounds to me like the planned pathway is only on the Randall&#039;s Island side of the bridge. I think&nbsp; (again, I&#039;m not really an expert on this, so could be wrong) that the city got a bunch of $$ from a consortium of private schools in exchange for the schools having the use of playing fields on the island, and that&#039;s where the renovations over there in recent years have come from. There&#039;s a newish bike/ped path that goes over around by the stadium &amp; connects with the 103rd street bridge to Manhattan - maybe this one will link with that somehow?
