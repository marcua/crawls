				My past experience of Greek restaurants in NYC was that the menu is not very interesting and that the food is rather greasy and not very fresh-tasting. However, I found that this new restaurant, Loukoumi, serves very different style of Greek food. We overjoyed when finding our favourite Tarama (Greek fish roe dip) on the menu, and it was so delicious; light and lemony. Fish roe may not sound very appetizing but, if you have never tried it before, I highly recommend to try it there. Also, they give you an option to have Calamari either fried or grilled. We ordered the grilled ones along with grilled octapus and sepia in a plate called thalassomeze if am not mistaken, and they were divine! They were tender and sweet, which is a good sign of freshness of squids used. The main courses (we ordered ) red snapper for my husband served with rice, potatoes or vegetable of the day, and the greek lamb stew topped with some kind of Greek cheese and berries ,were perfectly cooked and delicious, we were impressed with their lemon potatoes. It is completely different from what I had before in other restaurants. It was so nice to taste Greek food which is fresh-tasting, flavourful, and not heavy in your stomach.<br />We saw quite a few Greek wine that we have never seen or heard of. So, we are looking for going back to try them.<br /><br />We also found the service very good our server Leonidas and the owner, who is Greek, were both very friendly and generous.<br /><br />I highly recommend this new Greek restaurant and hope that many of you will try it.

				&nbsp;5 STARS LOUKOUMI TAVERNA I went here after a particularly stressful day so my memory of it is a bit shorter than it tends to be at other times. The Loukoumi Taverna Restaurant offered us a nice outdoor table and some really great lunch special options. I chose the Red Snapper which I thought were not only delicious but so plentiful I could not finish it.That pained me since those tasty meaty fish died for me and it was too hot to bring them home for later, which I guess in the case of fish is a good thing. Our sides of beets, horta and lemon potatoes proved to be quite the challenge for us and again we left too much to waste. :(((<br /><br />I have every intention of going back to experience the atmosphere that I was oblivious to and have those fried calamari again. But this time I will make sure not to eat for a week before going as the portions are that plentiful and very good value for the price.<br />I highly recommend Loukoumi Taverna Restaurant&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br />I can&#039;t wait to go back<br />tavernagreek.com<br />restaurantsgreek.com<br />toloukoumi.com

				By far Loukoumi is the best Greek seafood restaurant,<br />I usually go there for lunch with my parents when they&#039;re in Astoria, but it&#039;s also suitable for a romantic dinner. <br />One of my favorite Greek restaurants in Astoria NY,<br />&nbsp;Awesome atmosphere, service and of course food. <br />I had Greek salad and grilled salmon with lemon potatoes. You can tell that their food is super fresh and their seasoning is so perfect. Obviously I finished my meal with Greek yogurt. I am sure all the food on the menu is exceptional.<br />&nbsp;<br />

				I am sure this restaurant is wonderful.&nbsp; In fact, I&#039;ve always been curious about it, and it&#039;s always packed on the weekends.&nbsp; But I would be more apt to try it if the actual restaurant would come clean and ask us straight out to try the restaurant, instead of hiding behind fake customer names to do so.&nbsp; Not only is opening up multiple fake user accounts against board policy, but it is blatantly obvious to our long-time readers here and fools no one.&nbsp; We welcome direct interaction between restaurants and our readership and many that do that here receive a much better reception&nbsp; &nbsp;:mrgreen:

				I went there once in the summer during the heatwave and my table was the last still eating&nbsp; i guess during the time they probably close . So all of a sudden we start looking at each other and we couldnt believe that they shut the A/C off on us .&nbsp; We were having&nbsp; our last bites with sweat dripping . We complained but they said&nbsp; it was on all day and had to close it now since it was&nbsp; closing time soon .&nbsp; &nbsp; We never went there again .

				Well, let&#039;s break this down - The original poster&#039;s name is Loukoumi and his only post on this entire website is about Loukoumi restaurant.&nbsp; Highly suspect.&nbsp; Then you&#039;ve got Melinda05, also with only one post, and whose IP address is the same as Loukoumi.&nbsp; Also highly suspect.&nbsp; Her account has now been disabled.&nbsp; And then you have Galanos, also with one post and a glowing review.&nbsp; Galanos, if you really want to become a believable part of the Astorian community, then you need to actively and legitimately participate in other threads on Astorians.&nbsp; If your only post is about this restaurant and then you proceed to belittle and accuse any criticism as exemplary of a competitor - which I assure you I am not - then it leads your post to be highly suspect as well.&nbsp; Your reaction doesn&#039;t do the restaurant any favors and in fact, probably turns off the majority of our regular users.

				GRADE PENDING does not mean they weren&#039;t graded yet, it means that the restaurant got a low grade and are appealing it with the dept of health. From the minute they file the appeal, they are allowed to hang a sign saying GRADE PENDING instead of the grade they actually got. Only a restaurant that got a bad grade would have a GRADE PENDING...
