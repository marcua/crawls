				http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/21/nyregion/21podc.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin (http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/21/nyregion/21podc.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin)<br /><br />Astoria<br />Their So-Called Life, by Way of Queens <br />&nbsp;<br />By JEFF VANDAM<br />Published: May 21, 2006<br />Every week in a cramped living room in Astoria, Queens, five people sitting around a folding table covered with wires and microphones are making a bid for stardom. Using two computers, homegrown humor and a cheap bicycle horn, they record their banter and call it &quot;This Show Again,&quot; a half-hour audio program that claims to be the No. 1 podcast in Astoria. <br /><br />Not that there&#39;s much competition. <br /><br />The show, which has been recorded for nearly a year and can be downloaded at thisshowagain.com and on the Apple iTunes software, is the brainchild of Thomas J. Kelly, 29, an aspiring stand-up comedian who is the jokemaster-in-chief. His day job is researching humorous ideas for Top 40 radio hosts. <br /><br />&quot;This Show Again&quot; is attracting attention, with 400 to 800 downloads a week and a growing number of mentions, ranging from enthusiastic to downright mean, on rival podcasts.<br /><br />The crew assembles every Wednesday night in the apartment of Mike McGarrigle, also 29, a mechanical engineer. He is the best friend of Mr. Kelly, who drives in for the taping from his home in Massapequa, N.Y., where both men grew up. Other participants trickle in, and with some of them in bare feet or eating pizza, the taping begins. <br /><br />Popular topics include music, movies, odd news events, the participants&#39; lives, and everyday life in Astoria. &quot;We like to think Astoria is a character on the show,&quot; said Mr. Kelly, a chatterbox who records the show in his socks. <br /><br />The attention is not always positive. One recent category of discussion was &quot;Reason Why I Hate Astoria of the Week.&quot; The participants ranted about traffic on the Grand Central Parkway, what they considered the over-the-hill social scene at the famed Bohemian Hall and Beer Garden and the over-the-hill groceries at a local supermarket, where the sell-by dates had expired on four of five items Mr. McGarrigle had bought.<br /><br />Reaction to the supermarket story among his colleagues was swift.<br /><br />&quot;Maybe it&#39;s &#39;Worst Grocery-Store Shopper of the Week!&#39; &quot; Mr. Kelly suggested. <br /><br />Though the makeup of the show&#39;s panel sometimes changes, Mr. Kelly gives each participant ample time. And while jokes occasionally misfire — an event noted by Mr. McGarrigle with a honk of his bike horn — the people making them are usually funny, and listening to the show is often like sitting down with a bunch of friends at a neighborhood bar.<br /><br />The creators of the increasingly popular program harbor greater ambitions. &quot;We want to make it so big that we can get out of Astoria,&quot; Mr. Kelly said. <br /><br />Another regular, John McCann, ventured a plaintive reply. &quot;Where would we go, though?&quot; he asked. <br /><br />
