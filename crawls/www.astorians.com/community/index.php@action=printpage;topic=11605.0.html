				I realize nobody asked my opinion, but I think a sign of a happy, firm, steady, and stable relationship is not standing upon ceremony in terms of minor technical difficulties, e.g. flatulence. I yearn to be in a relationship where either of us could crack one off and neither of us cares. Not terribly romantic, and quite possibly rather odiferous, but so comfortable!!&nbsp; &nbsp;:smitten: Because sometimes, you just can&#039;t wait to get to the bathroom.

				The Ancient Greeks had a special room that people would go to fart in.&nbsp; Also, I have heard (although I cannot really vouch for this) that in parts of Germany it is okay to fart in public as long as you excuse yourself.<br /><br />I think that if someone has serious gas related issues it may be best to discuss this with a Doctor and perhaps alter your diet.<br /><br />We all do it but some folks seem to have a problem controlling this.&nbsp; Try Culturelle - it sets things straight in your intestinal tract and may lead to less flatulation.
