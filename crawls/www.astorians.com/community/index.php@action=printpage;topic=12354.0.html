				OK, so I have finally decided to buy a digital camera. I realized this when I was showing my friends my cell phone photos of my summer travels and walking tours of the City.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to spend a lot of money.&nbsp; However, I don&#039;t want the Flinstones version of the digital camera, either. <br /><br />I see myself taking a lot of cityscape and nature photos, at various times of the day, if that makes a difference.&nbsp; As you can probably tell, I&#039;m not a technical person. <br /><br />I&#039;ve done some initial research on the web and in stores, like Best Buy, J&amp;R, etc., but I was wondering if the very helpful members of Astorians can help me in my search.&nbsp; Last night, a fellow Astorian showed me a really nice Nikon 8.1 MP digital camera that I liked.&nbsp; It had a nice large screen to view the photos and I was told that it was affordable.&nbsp; I think I&#039;m going to check that model out, but I thought I would ask the board for recommendations, first.<br /><br />Thanks in advance.<br />

				A few questions...<br /><br />You say you don&#039;t want to spend a lot of money. What does that mean? $100? $300? $500?<br /><br />Is there anything specific you want in the camera? Small and light, or best picture quality? For large prints or mostly web? Do you expect to do much post-processing, or are you mostly just going to crop them and be done with it? <br /><br />In general, you can&#039;t beat dpreview.com (http://www.dpreview.com/) for thorough information and reviews.<br />

				I wholeheartedly endorse this camera: <br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Casio-EX-Z1080-Digital-Anti-Shake-Optical/dp/B000VHBQJ6/ref=pd_bbs_5?ie=UTF8&amp;s=electronics&amp;qid=1221980395&amp;sr=8-5<br /><br />I&#039;ve had mine for about a year and I&#039;ve never had any problems with it. The battery that comes with it is GREAT and holds its charge for a surprisingly long time. (I&#039;ve had problems with batteries in previous digital cameras) It has several very easy to use settings and takes FANTASTIC pictures. I use it mostly when I travel and take vacations (lots of landscape pics) but it takes great portraits as well.<br /><br />Good luck in your camera search! Let me know if you have any questions about the casio.&nbsp; :-)

				Based on recommendations here, I bought a Canon Powershot SD1100 IS yesterday at B&amp;H.&nbsp; It also has excellent reviews on CNET.com. This is my first digital camera (I don&#039;t even have a camera phone), and I&#039;m figuring out how to use it.&nbsp; I&#039;ve taken a couple of pictures and a bit of video.&nbsp; And I&#039;m liking it.&nbsp; I love the way it looks and feels in my hand.&nbsp;

				I don&#039;t have a specific camera recommendation as mine is probably three years old at least (but I like it, a Panasonic Lumix), but what I will recommend is that you look for a camera with a greater optical zoom. Most digital cameras have a 3x optical zoom, and then a digital zoom. You want to try to avoid using the digital zoom if you can -- it lowers the picture quality. My Lumix has a 6x optical zoom and I bought it specifically for that reason. Also, the trend seems to be to offer more and more megapixels, which is fine, but most people don&#039;t really need that many megapixels unless you&#039;re planning to print posters. And the more megapixels, the more space the pictures take up on your hard drive and memory card (assuming you use the highest resolution in the camera). So, this is basically a long-winded way of saying that I would focus more on the optical zoom and less on the MP of the camera, especially as you specifically mentioned nature shots which often require zooming significantly.

				Are you considering digital SLR?<br /><br />I would buy from Amazon or Newegg.<br />B&amp;H is a great store, but you can save lots of cash from Amazon. <br /><br />I would go to B&amp;H to browse and marvel at all the gear, but if you do your research and decide on a model go with an online vendor like Amazon.<br /><br />Don&#039;t worry about buying from there - I bought my Canon 1D with 3 lenses from there - i do pro photography as a hobby.

				Congrats on purchasing a Canon point and shoot -- Canon has consistently made some of the best point and shoot cameras pretty much since digital photography began. But for anyone who might check out this thread looking for suggestions I&#039;m going to second the recommendation for the Panasonic Lumix line of point and shoot cameras since they are pretty much the cream of the crop these days when it comes to digital point and shoot cameras. I&#039;m also going to add a mild warning that while I own and love my Nikon DSLR, Nikon doesn&#039;t make the best point and shoot cameras available and in fact many people might even rank their current offerings pretty poorly. However as I just said if you&#039;re looking to step up to a DSLR Nikon is the current king of the crop.<br /><br />Hope this info helps someone.&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />If you want more check out dpreview.com or imagingresource.com -- they&#039;re both great online sources for reliable reviews and digital photography news.

				You might consider the new micro-four-thirds format of electronic-viewfinder interchangable-lens cameras. The Panasonic Lumix DMC-G1 (http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/panasonicdmcg1/) is getting pretty good reviews, and it has a really nice combination of features. It&#039;s basically an SLR camera, but without the &quot;R&quot; part, so no heavy mirrors and lenses. But you get a larger CCD than with a standard point-and-shoot, you get interchangable lenses, you get an external flash mount, and it&#039;s a bit cheaper than an entry-level SLR. This is the camera I want to get to replace my Lumix FZ-20 (http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/panasonicfz20/)...

				Camera lens are what makes a camera, not the body.&nbsp; Always try to get the best lens you can afford.&nbsp; Good lenses have special glass that that improve color and sharpness.&nbsp; Having a nice camera body with all the bells and whistles is an expense you really don&#039;t need.&nbsp; You will probably never use half the features anyway.&nbsp; I would buy a cheaper camera body and save up for a better quality lens.&nbsp; I use Canon.&nbsp; Since I bought better lens (the L lens) my photography has improved 100%.&nbsp; My pictures are much more sharp with accurate color.&nbsp; <br />Here are some of my photos on Flickr<br /><br />http://www.flickr.com/photos/winputig2/sets/72157608449843114/
