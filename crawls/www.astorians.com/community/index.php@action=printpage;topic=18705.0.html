				&nbsp;:?

				A key fee is actually very illegal (look it up) but a lot of landlords do practice it.&nbsp; When I was living in a Pistilli property, he took a key fee of $100, meaning you get the fee back when you return the key.&nbsp; I made them specify that the deposit would be returned to me in my receipt and the lease, and when I moved out, I made sure it was.&nbsp; I also had to hassle them to get my interest on my rent, and after many phonecalls, this was also returned to me.<br /><br />If you do give this fee, make sure you have a receipt and a written guarantee it will be returned to you when you move out.&nbsp; And I doubt it would be $1150, that&#039;s just crazy.&nbsp; I would assume it&#039;s $100 or lower.<br /><br />Oh edit that last statement - that key fee of that high amount is awful!&nbsp; Just reread the ad.&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-o&nbsp;

				Yup, it&#039;s illegal and high and sketchy, but basically equivalent to what you&#039;d pay a broker. The supers in these buildings wield all the gatekeeping power, and there&#039;s no getting the apt. without the fee (they don&#039;t list vacancies on CL or with any agents).<br /><br />For the several people that I know who&#039;ve moved into these buildings, the fee was very reasonable since they would otherwise be paying a broker the same amount. And frankly, to get a spacious rent-stabilized one-bedroom in an elevator building for under $1200... if you plan to stay in that place for any length of time, it&#039;s a reasonable investment.<br /><br />Other than the fee, it seems like the management (in these particular buildings) is good. I&#039;ve never heard any complaints from the four people I know who live there.<br /><br />And unlike the Pistilli arrangement, it&#039;s not the management company that gets the money here, but the super. At least you&#039;re paying someone that you&#039;re actually going to have an ongoing relationship with. Maybe that&#039;s more palatable than paying a broker?

				What is it about real estate in this city that turns people into vultures? The super is not even remotely entitled to profit from renting apartments, but I guess that is the only way to get the apartment, but I guess people pay what they have to...

				I always thought ‘key’ fee meant you had to pay someone off to get the keys to the apartment (or even to view a place), not a deposit on the keys.<br /><br />It&#039;s bad enough that the tenant has to pay the brokers fee, but at least it&#039;s a legitimate business transaction in that you receive a receipt and a lease is signed.<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry anyone who pays key money is a CHUMP. Is the super going to give a receipt? Is he reporting it as income? <br /><br />You make it sound so simple but this is how people end up getting ripped off. Great management company that let&#039;s their employees rip people off.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				That&#039;s what they are saying daisy. It&#039;s essentially a bribe to the super or whoever and it&#039;s really easy to scam people. I&#039;m sorry for the chumps comment MagicPie but the practice is more than shady. It&#039;s how many people are scammed and it&#039;s worse than the whole broker system to rent an apartment.

				Oh noes!&nbsp; Negative nods!&nbsp; Why did I try to defend chumps?&nbsp; <br /><br />I appreciate what you guys are saying, I really do.&nbsp; And maybe I should stop trying to explain but here goes: It seemed a lot less shady than most of the brokers who work in Astoria, I&#039;ll be honest.&nbsp; At our previous apartment, we paid a month&#039;s rent, in cash, to a &quot;broker&quot; who met us on the street, didn&#039;t have an office or a business card and didn&#039;t know anything about the apartment.&nbsp; All he had was the key.&nbsp; Was his ten minutes of work worth a month&#039;s rent?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; But we needed an apartment badly and it was the perfect place.&nbsp; He just got the finder&#039;s fee.&nbsp; The whole system is broken and when you need a place to live, you choose your battles.&nbsp; &nbsp;And now I hate really brokers and will do whatever it takes to avoid them.&nbsp; <br /><br />I can compare it to health insurance.&nbsp; It&#039;s a totally broken scam of a system.&nbsp; But if you want proper medical care, you have to play along.&nbsp; <br /><br />I didn&#039;t want to start a whole debate (and I realize mentioning healthcare is a great way to avoid a debate), I&#039;m just saying that the &quot;fees&quot; for certain apartments are always going to be there.&nbsp; You&#039;re getting screwed either way -- you&#039;re just choosing who gets to screw you, the broker or the super or the landlord.&nbsp; While I&#039;m busy reporting things to the authorities that will do nothing to stop the practice, someone else will move in and I&#039;ll be homeless.&nbsp;

				MagicPie, I understand what you are saying, but the fact is you would not have been homeless- just wouldn&#039;t have the apartment you wanted.<br />I am kind of on the fence about this whole thing. I&#039;ve been apartment hunting for a few months now, and it seems like every other schmuck out there is trying to profit off you without actually having a justifiable reason to get paid. IMO, these supers are just as bad as the shady Astoria brokers that you (And I) hate. <br />One side of me knows it&#039;s ridiculous, unjust and technically against the rules. The other side of me is debating on whether this is the kind of ball you have to play in order to get a place you actually want in this city. I&#039;ve been searching for a while now trying not to pay any of these ridiculous &quot;broker&quot; or &quot;key&quot; fees, and believe me it is very frustrating and leaves me a bit disillusioned with the whole city.

				Perhaps they should just call the key fee a super&#039;s payoff fee, in this case.&nbsp; No way do keys cost that much.&nbsp; And to not even have it refunded to you.&nbsp; I understand people will put up with anything to get a decent apartment in this city, as I&#039;ve been in the same position, but at least it wasn&#039;t nearly that much money and it was refunded to me.&nbsp; But I have paid broker&#039;s fees too and we just have a really bad system in this city.&nbsp; There are good brokers out there, but they are few and far inbetween.<br /><br />

				i would just like to point out that there is a major difference between this &quot;fee&quot; and a broker&#039;s fee.&nbsp; I am <strong>never ever</strong> one to defend a broker but they have every right to claim their fee as they are LICENSED to do so.&nbsp; This super on the other hand has absolutely no right to claim a fee.&nbsp; that is the difference here and it is quite a large difference.&nbsp; <br /><br />Astoria a relatively small community in these parts, especially renters.&nbsp; If people stop paying these illegal fees and spread the word in places like this forum not to pay these ILLEGAL fees than the super will no longer be able to charge them.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would also be very skeptical about living in a place with a dishonest and unethical super.&nbsp; Will he/she hold you hostage &quot;for a fee&quot; when the heat goes out too?&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Anytime you are looking for a rent stabilized apartment you need to know that the super is your best friend. The &#039;key fee&#039; has been around since the 1940s. Supers, and not brokers or management office personnel, have always had the power to rent to appropriate tenants. They stock the building with people who are friendly and cooperative. You just need to cough up around one month&#039;s rent. They will be readily available for all your needs. <br /><br />I live in a building with 140 apartments. Ten years ago my super gave me his home telephone number. Anytime&nbsp;I need him, I can call, and he is here within an hour or less. If it is an emergency . . . like when a pipe burst in my kitchen, he was here in 60 seconds. <br /><br />He can be your best friend . . . or your worst enemy. Tip well.

				Yeah, my emotional reaction is pretty much on par with Zytos&#039;s. I regret that we now accept paying truckfuls of money as a necessary part of any real estate transaction, but it&#039;s hard for me to get much more exercised about key fees than about standard broker fees. In both cases we&#039;ve got people exploiting their control over the supply of real estate in order to gouge customers.<br /><br />Here&#039;s another scenario: how come it&#039;s perfectly legal (I think?) for the managing company/owners to operate their own real estate brokerage (listing &amp; showing only their own apartments, of course), and thereby collect both the rent and a broker&#039;s fee for every apartment that they rent? Not to disparage or single out a single company, but isn&#039;t this what Partridge Realty does? A friend of mine moved across the hall in one of their buildings when one of his neighbors moved out, and STILL had to pay a broker&#039;s fee straight to his landlords, on top of the fee he&#039;d paid to move into his first apartment a few years ago. Isn&#039;t there something a little sick about that?

				Zytos and Litza- I can&#039;t agree with you guys there. The harm is that it keeps perpetuating itself. I would not like to pay increased rent, but I would like to pay just the rent. The super does nothing to justify getting paid basically. <br /><br />NY Apartments basically rent themselves. The demand is so high that brokers are really not needed. If they didn&#039;t exist, landlords would end up making more money because they would not have to pay out the broker, and tenants would pay less as well. It would be a win-win. Basically these people ultimately increase costs from both ends and profit off it. It&#039;s the biggest scam ever: none of their clients benefit or save money. <br /><br />To answer your question, Litza, about why one is legal and not the other- Key Money is just a preference bribe basically, and Licensed Real Estate brokers are (Allegedly) charging for the service of showing the apartment, running credit checks, etc and (are supposed to)hold some level of accountability. Unfortunately, in my opinion, they seem to blend together as basically the same thing.

				I don&#039;t condone the idea of a key fee but it sounds like you get more value for that fee than you do your broker fee.&nbsp; A key fee gets you a rent stabilized apartment and possibly some preferential (or at least decent) treatment from a super.&nbsp; <br /><br />Some people don&#039;t want to save the baby jesus whales and right every wrong.&nbsp; Some people just want a nice apartment and a reactive super.&nbsp; For some, its money well spent considering, in this neighborhood, most people get stuck with broker fees anyway. <br /><br />If I found the right apt in the right building I would pay this fee in lieu of a broker fee.&nbsp; 6 in one hand, 1/2 dozen in the other.<br /><br />I also buy stuff that falls off the back of trucks.&nbsp;

That&#039;s my problem with this whole system-&nbsp; It&#039;s basically extortion. <br /><br />While this may be part of the current (under the table) system, it does not have to be. The more people don&#039;t buy into it, the quicker it will go away, and we can all stop paying people out who just jump in out of nowhere and extort money from you.

I am attempting to quantify the value of a key fee vs. a broker fee to an individual regardless of the law.&nbsp; I’m putting the legal aspects aside.&nbsp; I’m playing devils advocate.<br /><br />I’m putting myself in the position of someone who needs an apt, found one that is reasonably priced, rent stabilized and I did it without a broker.&nbsp; My family and I love the apartment, I work long hours and have kids that I would rather focus on than continuing to hunt for a new apartment.&nbsp; Lastly, the broker and key fee are the same and the odds of getting caught doing this illegal activity are almost 0.<br /><br />Looking at it from that very practical perspective, the ROI (or even potential ROI) for a key fee seems higher than the actual ROI on a broker fee.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Definitely – no guarantee the super would be better.&nbsp; Just the potential to get better or at least standard service.<br /><br />Emergencies are difficult to forecast so better safe than sorry.&nbsp; That is why many people get additional insurance when they rent a car, have life insurance, tip their super during the holidays... etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;Right or wrong, odds are if 2 tenants have the same problem at the same time the super is going to work for the person they like more first.&nbsp; Creating that bond could be from taking the time to make small talk when you see each other, tipping at Christmas, baking cookies… a hundred different things but greasing the wheels (in any way – not necessarily just $’s) never hurts.<br /><br />At the least, you are in a rent stabilized apartment.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don’t think you get any long term value from a broker despite the fact that it’s an acceptable legal process.&nbsp; <br />

				I think the bottom line is pretty clear- someone is charging you extra money for them to be doing something they&#039;re already supposed to be doing.<br /><br />1) A super&#039;s job is to fix problems in the apartment. That&#039;s what his boss pays him for. <br />I&#039;m not sure what most of you guys do for a living, but if I turned around to my boss or clients and said, &quot;Yes, I know you&#039;re already paying for my services, but pay me a fee so that I&#039;ll do my job&quot;, I&#039;d be fired before I could even finish the sentence.&nbsp; You know what I do to get my super to fix stuff? I pay Rent!<br /><br />2) When an apartment becomes available, it should just be available to rent. <br />Imagine if I went to the local grocery store, and just decided to jump in front of the dairy section and told you I&#039;d give you access to the milk for a small fee. That&#039;s ridiculous, right? I mean, it&#039;s already there and available- who the hell is this guy to jump in the middle and say, &quot;you can&#039;t get it unless you pay me&quot;?<br />

				This is the sort of corruption that is baked in to any sort of market that is heavily regulated, especially when price controls, i.e. &quot;rent stabilization&quot; are part of that regulatory regime.
