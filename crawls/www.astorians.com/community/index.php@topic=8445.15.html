								<div class="inner" id="msg_99561">That chart is AWESOME.&nbsp; Hahaha.&nbsp; Very scientific.<br /><br />Debbie, I agree that our impact has been substantial and that we&#039;ve done damage to this planet.&nbsp; Sure, humans don&#039;t make meteors and such, but it doesn&#039;t mean&nbsp; However, you (and not just rebutting you, but the general thought as well) are not taking into account a few key facts.&nbsp; <br /><br />First, we didn&#039;t really have adequate temperature measurements before the Industrial Revolution.&nbsp; So, there is no way to know if such serious temperature swings occurred before then, because we couldn&#039;t measure them.&nbsp; Secondly, we have not had a SERIOUS volcanic eruption <a href="http://www.volcanolive.com/large.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.volcanolive.com/large.html</a> or <a href="http://www.volcano.si.edu/world/largeeruptions.cfm" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.volcano.si.edu/world/largeeruptions.cfm</a> since the Industrial Revolution.&nbsp; While these pump out MASSIVE amounts of greenhouse gases, they also can cool the planet for years at a time.&nbsp; When large eruptions occurred previously, they caused ice ages.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thirdly, climate change takes hundreds, thousands, or millions of years.&nbsp; The previous 150 or so years is just a speck of time in that total span.&nbsp; We could have already been in the middle of a climate change and, as humans with a very short time on this planet and an even shorter recorded history, could have no idea.&nbsp; This cycle could have started in the 1600s and just beginning to come to fruition; we&#039;d have no idea.<br /><br />Lastly, (well, for my rebuttal, anyway) I saw a show on NatGeo last night that talked about the major extinctions that have happened on this planet.&nbsp; The scientist presenting the program stated that we have a massive extinction on this planet about every +/- 62 million years.&nbsp; This is due to the fact that our solar system moves up and down in the Milky Way, which puts it in and out of the main protection of the Milky Way&#039;s magnetic field; which protects us from radiation.&nbsp; They use the example of a diver observing different levels of light by being closer or further from the surface.&nbsp; Anyway, we&#039;re about +/- 10 million years away from another extinction.&nbsp; So, who is to say we aren&#039;t beginning to see another one approaching?&nbsp; Here&#039;s the article if you&#039;d like to read it: <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/04/070420-extinctions.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/04/070420-extinctions.html</a><br /><br />I&#039;m not trying to argue with you.&nbsp; I believe we have sped up the process and in no way think that we shouldn&#039;t do everything in our power to curb our greenhouse/toxic gas emissions, live as green as possible, and save the bees.&nbsp; We aren&#039;t helping a thing at this point.&nbsp; But, I think that, honestly, a lot of it is out of our hands.&nbsp; We can adapt, or we can die, as we have since we stood up on two legs and were able to give the thumbs-up. <br /><br />(Sorry for all the evolution and the more-than-6,000-year-existence of the earth talk, devoutly religious folk.&nbsp; I should have said &quot;ear-muffs&quot;)&nbsp; </div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_100615">Hysterics is a strong word, but I think that it applies to some (not all) of the people who are concerned about global warming.&nbsp; Just as people can become hysterical about any issue in which blind passion supercedes the facts.&nbsp; I&#039;m not saying that Astorians poster Debbie is in hysterics or anything like that.&nbsp; What I am saying is that we need to calm down and consider the facts.&nbsp; This problem was here before it came into the public spotlight, and in our rush to fix things we don&#039;t want to do more harm than good. <br /><br />Obviously, we should all be concerned about climate change.&nbsp; We all have to live on this earth, and we haven&#039;t been the best stewards.&nbsp; But unsound and unfair practices like carbon offsets aren&#039;t necessarily the answer.&nbsp; If we are going to do our bit to reduce our carbon footprint, we need to be smart about it.&nbsp; One example I love to talk about is newspaper recycling.&nbsp; Paper recycling is actually worse for the environment than just creating new paper, but the perception is that this is not the case.&nbsp; So even though we mean well, we continue a practice which harms, rather than helps, our environment.<br /><br />Using the word &quot;hysterics&quot; is perhaps condescending.&nbsp; But what is really condescending to me is when a big Hollywood star who flies private jets, when they could fly coach with the rest of us, and has a huge mansion with a giant power bill tells the rest of us about simple steps we can all take to reduce our emissions.&nbsp; I am thinking particularly of three egregious examples: an actress and songstress who has an air conditioned barn for her clothes, a famous actor who is an avid pilot and has an airstrip on his property, and a Nobel Prize winning author and film producer who has a mansion with a carbon footprint that dwarfs everything else in his area.<br /><br />What particularly galls me is when such people atone for their energy use through carbon offsets.&nbsp; The carbon usage is often offset by offering incentives for people in the developing world to continue doing manual labor by hand rather than mechanizing.&nbsp; That is unconscionable in my book.<br /><br />Again, Debbie, this is not a personal dig at you.&nbsp; I certainly hope to avoid one of our famous circular arguments.&nbsp; :-)</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_100656">Just a couple quick corrections, for the record.<br /><br />A significant source of methane, a greenhouse gas (NOT related to the Ozone layer, which is an entirely different entity in a different part of the atmosphere with a different role completely) IS &#039;cow farts&#039; mostly due to the huge numbers of cattle kept in industrial feedlots and fed on corn (grain fed cattle), which is not the diet to which their digestive system is adapted, being grazers. Ergo, lots of methane (and antibiotics, etc. etc.). <br /><br />A very large number of very good scientists for very many years have been working on ice core data, which does give us a climate record that extends far, far back before the Industrial Revolution - 100s of thousands of years. Furthermore, geologists and geochemists have been able to use similar sources of data (isotopic ratios) in the rock record to push it back into the millions. Temperature data. We have it. Its long term. <br /><br />Mass extinctions are particularly tricky things. Whether or not the apparent periodicity of mass extinctions is a &#039;real&#039; phenomenon has been debated amongst us paleontologists for years now, ever since Raup and Sepkoski showed some nice comet stuff that fit with the ever-popular Alvarez hypothesis for the demise of everyone&#039;s favourite fossils, the dinosaurs. However, the evidence is very far from clear on this stuff, National Geographic specials aside. We are in the midst of the sixth mass extinction, the rate far exceeds the &#039;background rate&#039; of extinction and appears to be higher than any previous mass extinction, including the Permian/Triassic event which was the largest in Earth&#039;s history (~90% of species lost). <br /><br />I have absolutely no idea what the volcano example is supposed to show, but the sophisticated models being built by the nobel-prize winning scientists who work on this have *gasp* actually taken this into account. Surprise! we took geology 101! See Hansen et al. latest publication in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA for an example of this modelling and an assessment of its accuracy. <br /><br />The ice record etc. shows pretty uncontrovertibly that climate is changing. Extinction rates are very high. Correlative to the temperature change is an increase in greenhouse gases caused by human activity. The greenhouse effect is responsible for Earth not being cold like Mars but also not being run-away hot like Venus (where all C is in the atmosphere, rather than locked up in rocks/fossil fuels/organisms as it is here on Earth). Sometimes, 2 + 2 = 4!<br /><br />Now, you may not agree with some of the way activists on this issue have behaved. But for please get your science right and stop listening to the spinners. </div>

Slathering on baby oil was not healthy for you in your youth, you just cared less.&nbsp; People screamed about a hole in the ozone layer which morphed into a global warming crisis and somehow it all became an emergency.&nbsp; But the hole in the ozone is gone and now there is too much CO2 where the hole used to be. <br />The CO2 craze will go the way of the ozone layer.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Oh my god. <br />Firstly, as an antipodean, I can tell you the Ozone hole is still very much around. Australia has the highest rate of skin cancer in the world, and that&#039;s because we&#039;re right under that damn hole. <br /><br />Secondly, the destruction of the ozone was a relatively easy thing to solve - we figured out it was going on, there was basically one source of ozone destruction, CFCs, and they were made by pretty much just one company. Everyone got together to put together the Montreal Protocol which banned the use of CFCs, they were phased out, and here we are. The hole seems to be slowly diminishing, although it will take time (and there&#039;s some seasonal effect there too) but basically everything we can do about it, we&#039;ve done. <br /><br />Carbon Dioxide is clearly a much more difficult gas to control (not to mention Methane, water vapour and other more minor greenhouse gases) and with countries like Australia and the US not getting on board the Kyoto Protocol attempt to control them in a similar way (which obviously is pretty problematic), things haven&#039;t worked out quite the same way. <br /><br />Again, try learning about something before being so vehement about it. </div>

Yes, worst case scenario is that we go and take a lot of species with us - life will most likely persist and the planet isn&#039;t going anywhere. <br /><br />I think a better approach is to worry about (in order of importance)<br />a) improving the situation of those in developing nations who will feel the brunt of this change <br />b) thinking about how we can live more sustainably and developing new technologies that help us do so (CFLs! LEDs! Who needs the incandescent light bulb anymore?)<br />c) moving towards getting rid of fossil fuel use except in absolutely essential situations (Jet Fuel is currently the only example I can think of, but its a good one)<br />d) being much more sensible about how we use water<br />e) working on carbon sequestration techniques?<br /><br />There&#039;s lots to do and to be done! Pessimism doesn&#039;t get us anywhere, but enthusiasm and dedication does. I&#039;m sorry this has gone so far that there&#039;s this real backlash about it politcally, but I&#039;m glad America IS finally with the rest of the world on talking about these issues, even if we&#039;re still about 20 years behind. If there&#039;s something America does really really well, its innovate and diversify into new technologies/areas. So let&#039;s get on board America and start working on this! The billionaires of the next century, the Hearst empires, can be built now by people thinking forward on this.</div>

Ergo, lots of methane (and antibiotics, etc. etc.). <br /><br /><strong>I don&#039;t know where this rebuttal came in, but isn&#039;t another significant source of increased methane the &quot;melting&quot; of the frozen methane hydrates on the sea floor?&nbsp; Also, if you read down at the bottom, it states that releasing of this methane might HELP by releasing these greenhouse gases and keeping the planet WARMER in the instance of global cooling.</strong><br /><br />A very large number of very good scientists for very many years have been working on ice core data, which does give us a climate record that extends far, far back before the Industrial Revolution - 100s of thousands of years. Furthermore, geologists and geochemists have been able to use similar sources of data (isotopic ratios) in the rock record to push it back into the millions. Temperature data. We have it. Its long term. <br /><br /><strong>You&#039;re right.&nbsp; I never said that we haven&#039;t done damage, but are we the end all?&nbsp; Are we &quot;destroying&quot; the planet?&nbsp; Look at this: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Younger_Dryas" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Younger_Dryas</a>&nbsp; Doesn&#039;t that seem to show MASSIVE climate changes that would have had NOTHING to do with humans?&nbsp; Large climate changes are a WAY OF LIFE on this planet.&nbsp; Northing is to say this one hasn&#039;t started already. In fact, here&#039;s another article: <a href="http://www.whoi.edu/page.do?pid=12455&amp;tid=282&amp;cid=9986" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.whoi.edu/page.do?pid=12455&amp;tid=282&amp;cid=9986</a>.&nbsp; Also, &quot;millions&quot; of years on this planet is still equivalent to a fart in the wind when you&#039;re talking roughly 4.5 billion years of existence.&nbsp; IIRC, the first few billion years of earth were kinda hot with all that molten rock slinging around.&nbsp; Wonder what ice core samples register those temp readings at?</strong><br /><br />Mass extinctions are particularly tricky things. Whether or not the apparent periodicity of mass extinctions is a &#039;real&#039; phenomenon has been debated amongst us paleontologists for years now, ever since Raup and Sepkoski showed some nice comet stuff that fit with the ever-popular Alvarez hypothesis for the demise of everyone&#039;s favourite fossils, the dinosaurs. However, the evidence is very far from clear on this stuff, National Geographic specials aside. We are in the midst of the sixth mass extinction, the rate far exceeds the &#039;background rate&#039; of extinction and appears to be higher than any previous mass extinction, including the Permian/Triassic event which was the largest in Earth&#039;s history (~90% of species lost). <br /><br /><strong>If we&#039;re in the midst of it, when did it start?&nbsp; 150 years ago when we started pumping out greenhouse/toxic gasses?</strong><br /><br />I have absolutely no idea what the volcano example is supposed to show, but the sophisticated models being built by the nobel-prize winning scientists who work on this have *gasp* actually taken this into account. Surprise! we took geology 101! See Hansen et al. latest publication in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA for an example of this modelling and an assessment of its accuracy.<br /><br /><strong>The volcanic data was to show that we&#039;ve not had a serious eruption in recent times.&nbsp; A serious volcanic eruption can change the climate so drastically, especially when it comes to cooling.&nbsp; Since we haven&#039;t had one in awhile that has had the serious global cooling repercussions, maybe that&#039;s why we&#039;re warming?&nbsp; Ever read about Global Dimming?&nbsp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_dimming" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_dimming</a>&nbsp; If you go along with it, we&#039;re doing it now with polluting the environment.&nbsp; However, a large volcano eruption or meteorite impact would do the same thing.</strong> <br /><br />The ice record etc. shows pretty uncontrovertibly that climate is changing. Extinction rates are very high. Correlative to the temperature change is an increase in greenhouse gases caused by human activity. The greenhouse effect is responsible for Earth not being cold like Mars but also not being run-away hot like Venus (where all C is in the atmosphere, rather than locked up in rocks/fossil fuels/organisms as it is here on Earth). Sometimes, 2 + 2 = 4!<br /><br /><strong>No one is DENYING climate change, OR that humans are contributing to it.&nbsp; We ARE questioning whether we are the SOLE CAUSE of it.&nbsp; We could trap every cow fart tomorrow and still end up with an ice age or extreme warming.&nbsp; The planet has had these rapid changes throughout it&#039;s existence (the Younger Dryas event is one example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Younger_Dryas" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Younger_Dryas</a>.&nbsp; Thanks for the math lesson, though.</strong><br /><br />Now, you may not agree with some of the way activists on this issue have behaved. But for please get your science right and stop listening to the spinners. <br /><br /><strong>Well, thanks for the science lesson and for setting us straight on listening to the boogieman on climate change.&nbsp; Again, most people aren&#039;t saying that we DON&#039;T believe in climate change OR that we humans aren&#039;t contributing to it.&nbsp; However, we ARE saying that we aren&#039;t the only cause, nor the driving factor behind it.&nbsp; If climate change is a boat, rowing down stream through a set of rapids (climate change can get tumultuous), our contribution is like rowing that boat.&nbsp; It might speed us up a hair, but we were headed that way, relatively uncontrollably, anyway.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now, this is just my opinion, which I am entitled to just like you are yours.&nbsp; We all have the possibility of being wrong.</strong><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></div>

Disappearing bees is definitely a problem.&nbsp; They pollinate so much of the food we eat, we&#039;d be in serious trouble if they disappeared.</div>
