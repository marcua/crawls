				You don&#039;t have to start one yourself.&nbsp; The Astoria Performing Arts Center (http://www.apacny.org/index.html) has youth programs for 4th - 8th graders, as well as another program for middle school students.&nbsp; From their website:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">APAC is a not-for-profit arts organization that couples professional theatre programming with community outreach efforts.&nbsp; Each year, APAC brings extended networks of artists, technicians and interns together to produce major musicals, classical, and modern plays.&nbsp; Committed to bringing new voices to visibility in New York theatre, APAC has held 3 playwriting contests, and produced two staged readings.&nbsp; Examples from its youth and senior programming portfolio include an annual free summer intensive musical theatre training program for Astoria&#039;s 4th â€“8th graders (SUMMER STARS), an after school playwriting program for middle schoolers (the ASTORIA PLAYMAKING PROGRAM), bringing live entertainment to various senior centers in Astoria (with VOCAL EASE), and the extremely successful musical theatre training and performance program for Queens residents over 60 years of age:&nbsp; SENIOR STARS!</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Thanks for the info. We could travel to Manhattan if we knew of a good place for kids theatre workshops. We&#039;re homeschoolers so I think we&#039;ll start something up soon at the library. Thanks.
