				I need some suggestions for getting away this weekend to a non-city destination (done Boston, Philly, and D.C.) and preferably under 2 hours in any direction. Thinking apple picking and/or day hiking in an interesting town to browse/shop in. Maybe even an antique shopping slant. Would love to hear about some specific places and possible hotel/BB options. Thanks!

				New Paltz is about an hour and a half away.&nbsp; Has a great little walkable town.&nbsp; Right near by is Mohonk and Minawaska (the setting for Dirty Dancing! :lol:)

				Greenport, L.I. is really nice - fresh seafood, cute boutiques and antique shops.&nbsp; If you have a car, you can also tour the vineyards, or take a pre-arranged tour from the hotel.&nbsp; There&#039;s another thread on here about Greenport - that&#039;s where I got all my recs from.

Haven&#039;t been in years but it&#039;s so different from the city and it&#039;s got that small-town feel you&#039;re probably looking for.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;d also suggest going out to LI - somewhere out in Suffolk.&nbsp; If you find the right town there will definitely be a great B&amp;B and some great little restaurants too.&nbsp; Good luck!! Wish I could do this.

				The lady friend and I went to the town of Hudson a couple of weekends ago. It was about 2.5 hours drive.<br />Beautiful small town, great restaurants and it&#039;s close to beautiful natural sites and hiking trails. The Hudson School of Art was born in this area. <br /><br />If you need a place to stay, we stayed at this great B&amp;B Mount Merino Manor http://www.mountmerinomanor.com/ (http://www.mountmerinomanor.com/)<br />The breakfast was amazing; Rita and Patrick were gracious hosts.

				I really love Greenport; we&#039;ve been going there for years -- I think it and the whole North Fork is a great weekend destination.&nbsp; Aside from that, early last fall we went to Beacon on the spur of the moment and had a really lovely time.&nbsp; I posted about it on the board somewhere.&nbsp; It&#039;s about 60 miles from Astoria, so definitely under two hours.&nbsp; Cold Spring is nearby, and also very nice, but it&#039;s more self-conscious (and more expensive) than Beacon is.&nbsp; Much of the main street in Beacon has been really spruced up, and the west end is now full of art galleries, and the east end has a number of funkier shops.&nbsp; There&#039;s also Dia:Beacon (http://www.diacenter.org/bindex.html), which is a museum for the Dia Art Foundation&#039;s art collection.<br /><br />In general, Beacon has developed quite an arts scene (Beaconarts.org (http://www.beaconarts.org/) has a lot of information.)&nbsp; Many of the galleries and other businesses participate in something called Second Saturday (http://beaconarts.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=9&amp;Itemid=41), where shops and galleries stay open late on the second Saturday of the month, and many restaurants offer something extra - a free glass of wine, for instance.&nbsp; We had no idea it was going on, and really lucked into it.&nbsp; A lot of the galleries offer free wine and cheese, and you can meander from gallery to gallery, checking out the offerings.&nbsp; There are several very good restaurants, too.<br /><br />When we went, we stayed at Botsford Briar Bed &amp; Breakfast&nbsp; (They don&#039;t have a website but I found a few photos of the house here (http://www.ajsarch.com/project_page_botsford.htm)) - it&#039;s a beautiful Victorian house that has been almost completely renovated.&nbsp; We found their number on a little pamphlet with local business listing in a funky coffee shop, and it turned out to be a great place to stay.&nbsp; They are on top of a hill close to the river and train station.&nbsp; Their phone number is 845.831.6099

				I can&#039;t remember the specific B&amp;B, but my wife and I went up to (about 2 hours, maybe a little less) Saugerties a few years ago for the weekend and it was fantastic.&nbsp; It&#039;s right next to Woodstock, with is a nice little walkaround kind of town.&nbsp; There are plenty of other activities up that way and you can hit little towns on the Hudson all the way back.&nbsp; If you&#039;re interested, I can try to dig up the name of the B&amp;B.&nbsp; There was a little river with a waterfall right behind it that was beautiful.
