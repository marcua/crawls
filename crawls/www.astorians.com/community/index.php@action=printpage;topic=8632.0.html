				The post regarding Thanksgiving in local chat got me to thinking about past Thanksgivings.&nbsp; Anyone have a particular memory about Thanksgiving that they would like to share?<br /><br />Personally, my all time favorite Thanksgiving was the last one I spent in Minnesota, in 2002.&nbsp; My grandfather had passed away earlier in the year so I wanted to surprise my grandmother, who I was very close to, by flying in and spending it with her and the family.&nbsp; They had been married for over 60 years and I wanted to make sure that she would be able to have a special Thanksgiving.<br /><br />I contacted my cousin who was a manager of Bakers Square in Minneapolis and asked her if we could have Thanksgiving dinner there since the restaurant was closing at 12 noon and nobody wanted to cook for so many people.&nbsp; I then called other relatives and we all gathered for what would be the best and the last Thanksgiving I would spend with my grandmother.&nbsp; It turned out that my cousin, her husband and a couple of employees from the restaurant cooked a traditional Thanksgiving meal.&nbsp; <br /><br />Outside it was a typical frigid November day in Minnesota, but inside we had a great time, telling stories and catching up with loved ones.&nbsp; It was truly my favorite Thanksgiving, by far.

				I live with 5 other random people that we ended up meeting through Craigslist rooms.&nbsp; Last Thanksgiving, we each invited our immediate families down from their respective homes (Colorado, Ohio, Upstate, California) and had a great dinner.&nbsp; It was really nice.&nbsp; It was actually the first time my parents really saw New York City as well.&nbsp; Beautiful time!

				The roomies and I cooked while our families enjoyed the feast.&nbsp; It was a lot of fun because it was our first time cooking Thanksgiving dinner.

				My favorite Thanksgiving was 2001 - I walked in the Macy&#039;s Thanksgiving Day Parade! I had (and still) watch it every year, so when my friend (who worked for Macy&#039;s) mentioned that summer that she was in charge of a float, I was all, &quot;OMG, I&#039;M SO THERE IF YOU WANT ME OR NOT. I AM THERE!!!!&quot;<br /><br />I was still living in Bridgeport at the time, and I woke up at 3am, drove to Stamford with her for 3:30, and got on the CT Macy&#039;s Charter Bus to the city. We went to some....room is the best way that I can describe it and got dressed. The room was CRAZY! Just people in costumes. And then we took a bus to the parade start. And it was insane with the costumes because it was like rush hour on the N, only dressed like christmas trees and fishes and stars and crazy stuff. Unfortunately I don&#039;t have any pictures, which is ridiculous. I think I was on parade overload.<br /><br />Anyway, I was a &quot;Simple Simon pie man&quot; (sponsored by Redi-Whip, haha) and I danced down broadway with the Billy Gilman float. (He was some 12-year old country one-hit wonder.) I have the NBC broadcast of it on tape somewhere, but apparently there was better Alison-spotting on CBS (my friend in Louisiana happened to catch me dancing my geeky butt off, full screen!), but I never got to see it :( If anyone has a copy of the 2001 parade from CBS, I will buy you dinner. I danced in Herald Square, and people clapped at me, and I high-fived little kids on the parade route. I&#039;m a huge dork, and I was in my glory.<br /><br />My family came to the parade, but since midtown and Grand Central was a madhouse, I just called them and told them I&#039;d meet them back in Bridgeport and jumped on a train. GCT was packed with people who had gone to see the parade (more packed than rush hour, and I did Metro North rush hour for 2 years), and I was the superstar of my car since I was in the parade! Haha! Then, I met up with my parents and sister at the train station, went to my aunt&#039;s for dinner (we were there by 2ish), and I promptly fell asleep on her couch around 3pm. I was BEAT!<br /><br />My Macy&#039;s friend ended up on a different float (the Rock Lobster float), and I&#039;m kind of jealous of that (ROCK! LOBSTER!) but whatever, I walked in my favorite parade of all time, so that pretty much ruled. Also, it was 50 degrees, which was also awesome.

				Also, here is a horribly unflattering picture of me in that crazy room:<br /><br />http://b4.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/00586/40/93/586043904_l.jpg (http://b4.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/00586/40/93/586043904_l.jpg)<br /><br />I loved my purple pants.<br /><br />(if that link doesn&#039;t work, sorry!)
