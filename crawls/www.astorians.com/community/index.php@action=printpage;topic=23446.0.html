				&nbsp;An effective fire and safety training &nbsp;(http://www.nifeindia.com/fire-safety-course.aspx/)&nbsp; &nbsp;course is very essential for occupational safety; whether it is a large office building with a few employees, or a factory with thousands of workers. This is because; emergency incidents like fire are not preplanned and can occur at any time anywhere. With adequate fire safety training and proper planning, we can be prepared to effectively respond to such incidents and thereby minimize losses. Fire and safety training courses, conducted by accredited fire and safety institutes, will help us identify the potential risks that we may face at workplace, so that we can avoid fatal and non-fatal accidents.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />Technically speaking, fire protection engineering or fire and safety engineering involves the right application of science and engineering principles to save people and environment from destructive effects of fire.&nbsp; Fire and safety engineering courses educate people about the safer plans which can be adopted to safeguard themselves from fire, and to control, prevent, and mitigate the destructive effects of fire, by evaluating the life safety of buildings, and applying necessary measures to control mishaps.&nbsp; These courses also include various measures that should be adopted during unexpected fire accidents.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />Fire safety engineering courses’ syllabuses will include both engineering and scientific sections, to help people acquire competence in fire and safety management. Fire Safety Engineering courses thus help in learning the various methods to successfully apply the techniques of fire science into the practical context, and thereby escape fire mishaps. <br />4
