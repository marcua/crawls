				http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/20/opinion/20dowd.html?8hpib<br /><br />Please share your thoughts.<br /><br />a teaser:<br /><br />Men are always telling me not to generalize about them.<br /><br />But a startling new study shows that science is backing me up here.<br /><br />Research published last week in the journal Nature reveals that women are genetically more complex than scientists ever imagined, while men remain the simple creatures they appear.<br /><br />&quot;Alas,&quot; said one of the authors of the study, the Duke University genome expert Huntington Willard, &quot;genetically speaking, if you've met one man, you've met them all. We are, I hate to say it, predictable. You can't say that about women. Men and women are farther apart than we ever knew. It's not Mars or Venus. It's Mars or Venus, Pluto, Jupiter and who knows what other planets.&quot;<br /><br />Women are not only more different from men than we knew. Women are more different from each other than we knew - creatures of &quot;infinite variety,&quot; as Shakespeare wrote.<br /><br />&quot;We poor men only have 45 chromosomes to do our work with because our 46th is the pathetic Y that has only a few genes which operate below the waist and above the knees,&quot; Dr. Willard observed. &quot;In contrast, we now know that women have the full 46 chromosomes that they're getting work from and the 46th is a second X that is working at levels greater than we knew.&quot;

				ok ok I will take this bait!<br /><br />:)<br /><br />For me, all generalizations regarding the sexes are toxic. &nbsp;<br /><br />Articles such as these degrade the intrinsic beauty within both sexes. &nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />A (male) friend of mine once wrote that women are the flowers of the earth. &nbsp;<br />To which I responded, &quot;If women are the flowers, then men are the trees&quot;.<br /><br />The more we approach each other in this way the more we love.

				Wow - that's a cool way to think of things Annwyn. I really resonate with what I understand of the concept behind your response.<br /><br />I get discouraged sometimes when I read all these studies that people do to try and quantify how men &amp; women, black &amp; white etc are so different. I wish we could find a way to not put humanity on some kind of &quot;Excel Spreadsheet&quot; in which the one with the biggest number, or the most scientifically complex structure &quot;wins.&quot; In my opinion it was this exact paradigm that did years of harm and oppression to every race, and gender on many issues, and at various times throughout history.<br /><br />I object to telling a woman that she can't be a top level scientist, or that she'd best make a stay-at-home-mom, or a white person that they are a are supposed to be a businessman/woman just because of the color of their skin, or a man that he can't cry or wear pretty colors if he wants, or a black person that they are &quot;poor&quot; and &quot;abused.&quot; Especially when such a statement is based on statistical &quot;data.&quot;<br /><br />I don't think there's anything wrong with being aware of genetic differences, and I'm not saying that it's wrong to study such things. I think there is beauty in diversity and in &quot;differences&quot;, and that true diversity and individuality is the only thing that's long-term sustainable so far as life is concerned. BUT - I think that a lot of the time too much value is placed on statistical data that seems to easily lead us to, or give us a right to ultimately force people into stereotypes and tell them what/who they should be, how they should feel or see themselves, or that they are more or maybe less important, beautiful, complex, intelligent, capable, strong, spiritual, etc than someone else.

				wow, I didn't take it that way at all. &nbsp;Maureen Dowd is a highly respected columnist, and I was glad that she took the time to write a tongue-in-cheek article that might catch the attention of people for whom news of this sort might pass outside the scope of normal reading material (like me) and prompt us (me) to get excited about something besides books and music and go digging for more information.<br /><br />I think it was fascinating that there is such variety coded into us. &nbsp;As I dig deeper into the topic - not only does the women's second X chromosome function at a much higher level than was previously thought, but the Y chromosome codes itself in a palendrome, so that while men don't have the same kind of &quot;back-up&quot; copy to repair mutated genes, they still have the copy written into the code. &nbsp;<br /><br />I've discovered that most people who read dowd's article, though, take what I think of as joking self-deprecating metaphors by some of the male scientists as a more literal commentary. &nbsp;My assumption (little as I know about science) is that it will probably take several more years of research to determine what, if any, impact this study shines on how we view gender behavioral differences. &nbsp;The only thing it seems to explain so far, as best as I can tell, is why men have a higher rate of some genetic diseases than women do.
