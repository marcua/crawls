				Good luck to them, I guess.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been in NYC nearly eight years and not only have I not adjusted to it, I feel less and less adjusted as time goes on.&nbsp; I can&#039;t wait to leave.&nbsp; But I guess no one place is right for everyone.

				Thanks, enigmacat - great article.&nbsp; I saw it earlier this week but didn&#039;t get a chance to read it until now.&nbsp; I most related to this part of the article:<br /><br />“I just realized that I didn’t need to find ‘it,’ that my place in the city would fall into place,” she said. “Now I don’t make an effort; I roll with things. It’s not just the city, it’s yourself that you have to deal with as well.”<br /><br />This is one of the things I struggle with the most.&nbsp; I ended up changing professions as a result and am very happy with that decision. A number of things came to a head just in the last month, even - I think that managing life in NYC is like handling a moving target sometimes.<br /><br />I&#039;d write more, but I have to run!&nbsp; :D

				I guess I think it&#039;s kinda weird. There&#039;s an adjustment period to every place you go and each place is different in terms of what it brings out in you. The question isn&#039;t if you&#039;ll find a way to deal with the place or fit in, but if you like what it is that the place brings out in you.

				&quot;No matter where you go.....there you are.&quot; <br /><br />People can fall into a trap of never being satisfied with where they live, when in fact it&#039;s a state of mind. I get really sick and tired of NY on a daily basis- cost of living, noise, litter, crowds, traffic- but when I&#039;m away, of course there&#039;s all kinds of stuff I miss. Usually, it&#039;s the stuff I take for granted.<br /><br />Living anyplace else might make me a little nuts for lack of food variety, service, convenience, energy, and the simple entertainment that comes from being packed in with so many other types of people. Also, plenty of freedom to be yourself.<br /><br />But boy do I crave a quiet night&#039;s sleep, ample living space, and a little cleanliness from neighbors who take pride in their neighborhood. Not to mention money in the bank.

				It took me a couple of years to really feel at home here - this included building a network and also just getting used to the new &quot;normal&quot;. What sounds are alarming, what situations are to be avoided, etc. When I first came here it was very unfamiliar and completely scary, all of it. <br /><br />Now I really love the city but I hate the ever-increasing rent and I also miss being close to my family. I know at some point I&#039;ll have to make a choice, and I&#039;m not looking forward to it.

				My experience here has been a little weird. I loved it here for my first year, but after that I just wanted out, and still do for various reasons. I&#039;m certainly glad I gave NY a shot, though, because I think I&#039;d regret later in life never taking the chance. Turns out I can&#039;t survive here, both financially and mentally, which makes me a bit sad because I thought after that first year I&#039;d be in for the long haul. There are hundreds of things I love about living here and will dearly miss, but for me the stuff that sucks far outweighs the wonderfulness. The feeling of not belonging here is difficult to live through. I often feel like a misfit anyway, but to feel so out of place day-to-day is taking its toll. I believe everyone should give New York a shot at some point in their lives, though. All that I&#039;ve learned through living here about myself, my personal happiness, money, relationships, how much I love home and family, and a million other things are invaluable and will follow me wherever I go. New York is a challenge, and if you can last more than six months here, you can survive anything!<br /><br />I think London will be my next big-city experience, after I&#039;ve sufficiently enjoyed my beloved California again and start feeling restless. I always feel at home among the British. God save the Queen!
