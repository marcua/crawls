				I work in the GrayBar Building, across the street from the Chrysler building and upstairs from Grand Central. The air on the 16th floor is so damn dry! My poor nose is a tiny microcosm of the Sahara. I hate it!!!! Is it like this in the other skyscrapers? Or is it just my crappy, windowless suite? <br /><br />AND SOMEONE KEEPS SHITTING ON THE FLOOR IN THE BATHROOM!!!!! Ten to one its one of my boss&#039;s clients. ARG!!!!! :ticked:<br /><br />Thank you for listening.

				Yes.&nbsp; It is quite dry in my office building.&nbsp; It&#039;s destroying my skin.&nbsp; <br /><br />What do you mean someone is shitting on the bathroom floor?&nbsp; Like the entire s___ is on the floor of the bathroom?&nbsp; As in, like, someone intentionally missed the toilet altogether?&nbsp; Like if someone locked a dog in the bathroom for ten hours after feeding it a bowl of granola cereal?&nbsp; That would be outstanding.

				Not only is the air in my office dry, but it&#039;s is a different temperature every day.<br /><br />So far this week it&#039;s been cold on Mon and Wed (say 60 degrees) and really hot Tuesday and Today. I&#039;d imagine it&#039;s about 80 or so, I have the fan on and the window open!

				I&#039;m not in a skyscraper, but we have pretty dry air too, probably because the AC is on at full blast all the time.&nbsp; I go through a lot of hand lotion.

				Same dry air where I work. I think this is pretty much a facet of working in an air-conditioned workplace - the AC must be on full blast at all times, even when it&#039;s freezing outside and also when it&#039;s really hot outside and everyone&#039;s wearing t-shirts. So I have to keep an extra sweater at work all the time. And my skin is always dry.
