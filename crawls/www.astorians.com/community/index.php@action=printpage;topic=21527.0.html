				I read about the coming of Butcher Bar here (http://www.bradleyhawks.com/2011/08/preview-of-15-new-restaurants-in.html) and walking by today the door was open and I could see the cool wood walls and what looks like a huge open kitchen.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t want to interrupt the workers to ask questions.<br /><br /><br />Other than the brief mention in Amuse Bouche I know nothing else.&nbsp; Anyone know anything?<br /><br /><br />I have to say that good bbq is missing in this neighborhood and would be an awesome addition.

				I know that the owner of the Pita Pan across the street is behind this place.&nbsp; He pointed out that he was opening something in the old Fresco Tortillas spot about three months ago.&nbsp; I was doing something at Pita Pan for my job, that&#039;s when he told me about it.<br /><br /><br />Definitely curious because I love some good BBQ!

				First Rule of Butcher Bar is there is no talk of Butcher Bar<br /><br />When I was at Pita Pan about a month ago we saw the mgt? coordinating and rcvg deliveries and manifests for the place across the street. So we asked one of the young ladies who worked there what was that place going to be and she said &quot; I am not eligible to speak about that at this time&quot;.

				This place is basically a plagiarization of several other restaurants.<br />3 Brothers Butchers - butcher shop bbq joint on bell blvd.<br />Torrissi - the decor and turkey sandwiches<br />This little piggy had roast beef -roast beef sandwiches<br />Fette Sau - the menu and equipment set up.<br />It&#039;s unfortunate that they could&#039;nt take some of the talent that is at all these places.<br />Obviously someone is jumping on the Fleischman&#039;s/Food Inc.

				I haven&#039;t been to this place yet (I very much want to) but all the points that BBQ Bob seems to miss that Fette Sau is an awful knock off of 80 year old BBQ joints in Lockhart, TX and that turkey and roast beef sandwiches aren&#039;t exactly proprietary menu items.

				Kid Murdoch your missing the point. The title of the thread asked &quot;Any Butcher Bar facts or rumors?&quot;<br />I just stated obvious facts. There is nothing original AT ALL about this place. Have I eaten there... YES. I was equally dissapointed with the quality of the food.The brisket was dry and burnt on the bottom, as was the pulled pork. If you are going to pass yourself off as a BBQ joint the food should have some sort of Smokey flavor and a pink Smoke ring. They had neither. I&#039;ve actually attempted to eat there 2 other times and was told they were out of BBQ. This was at 12:00 pm. 1 hour after they opened.<br />They are total AMATEURS, having grown up in Texas and raised on BBQ and forced to choke down what you New Yorkers call BBQ. In my opinion the only way you will get good BBQ at butcher bar is to get take out from John Browns and eat it at Butcher Bar. You also stated &quot;Fette Sau is an awful knock off of 80 year old BBQ joints in Lockhart, TX&quot; actually they are not. They had a concept and used their own imagination on how it would look. as opposed to Butcher Bar where it is PAINFULLY obvious that they walked around and cherry picked OTHER peoples ideas for there establishment.

				We brought this home last night for dinner as a take out order.&nbsp; They could not have been more accommodating.&nbsp; Everything was very good.&nbsp; We placed a large order to try a number of things - and have left overs for the work week.&nbsp; I loved the burnt ends.&nbsp; A slight sweetness that I liked.&nbsp; A bit fatty, but that&#039;s to be expected.&nbsp; But just right in terms of burnt and tender.&nbsp; The brisket was delicious.&nbsp; Just the right amount of smoke in my opinion.&nbsp; Even the cole slaw and pickles were excellent.&nbsp; The baked beans were a little too sweet, but I loved the flavor overall and would get them again.&nbsp; The mac and cheese was very good but I have no business eating it!&nbsp; Anyway, to sum up, I&#039;m not from Texas and will not pretend to be an authority on BBQ.&nbsp; But all I know is these people are working very hard to succeed and please their customers.&nbsp; The meat was delicious.&nbsp; I think the prices are fair for the product.&nbsp; No, it&#039;s not a bargain.&nbsp; But it&#039;s not overpriced either, if you ask me.&nbsp; I think they&#039;ll do very well in this location.&nbsp; It was packed last night with happy customers.&nbsp; I can definitely see us being regulars at this place, without a doubt.&nbsp; I want to try their burger as well.&nbsp; Apparently they caught the attention of the Silvercup studio crowd and can barely keep up with the orders.&nbsp; It really is that tasty.&nbsp; I can&#039;t compare it to John Browns, but frankly, this address on 30th is just better for us.&nbsp; But I agree, I think they both can succeed in Astoria without any problems.

				I had high hopes for John Browns and left VERY disappointed.&nbsp; &nbsp;I thought that the burnt ends at JBs (which everyone raves about) were over-seasoned and lacked the smoky goodness that it should have had.&nbsp; The pulled pork was completely tasteless and not &quot;cleaned up&quot; at all.&nbsp; It was just taken off of the bone in large chunks.&nbsp; I have had better pulled pork that was cooked inside in a slowcooker. <br />&nbsp;<br />I look forward to trying Butcher Bar...<br />&nbsp;

				I look forward to hearing what you think of the burnt ends.&nbsp; The best part was the that they were pretty seriously burnt, but tender enough that you didn&#039;t think you&#039;d crack a tooth.&nbsp; The flavor was subtle but delicious.&nbsp; Mildly smoky and a bit sweet, like molasses.&nbsp; But not overwhelming.&nbsp; I should add they they give you homemade sauces on the side.&nbsp; Nothing is drenched in sauce (which I don&#039;t like).&nbsp; And I chose not to even use the sauce.&nbsp; I thought the taste of the meat was just right on it&#039;s own.&nbsp; Which also speaks to the high quality meat they&#039;re using.&nbsp; I think this place is a winner.

				I wonder who BBQ Bob is?&nbsp; I just returned from Butcher Bar and everything was amazing, seriously.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been to Missouri, North and South Carolina, Texas and even to Korea, lol and have tasted all types and flavors of BBQ!&nbsp; Let me just say, I&#039;ve lived in Astoria for over 10 years and love the flavors of this beautiful neighborhood.&nbsp; It&#039;s a hodge podge of flavor.&nbsp; And Butcher Bar brings a new element that was missing.&nbsp; This being said, while walking one day a few months ago, I encountered the future Butcher Bar location and storefront, and was intrigued.&nbsp; As soon as I saw there SMOKE sign I was in love!&nbsp; I knew what was coming!&nbsp; When they opened I tried to get there but having family in town wasn&#039;t able to go.&nbsp; I finally made it tonight and damn!&nbsp; I am in Love.&nbsp; Not to hate on John Brown Smoke house, but there is no comparison.&nbsp; From the design, feel, comfort, staff, food quality and tastiness they realy blow away the abolitionist smoker!&nbsp; On that point, try the Burnt Ends at Butcher Bar! Wow!&nbsp; I also love the fact that they are a butcher shop and I can purchase fine locally sourced grass fed beef, heritage breed pork and organic chickens!&nbsp; I would like to tip my hat off to Kathy, for exceptional service and all the freebies they gave me and my partner.&nbsp; Corn cakes with organic honey butter, organic hearty chicken vegetable soup and their grandma&#039;s recipe apple pie that was all organic as well!&nbsp; My stomach is in heaven!&nbsp; I am in love!

				I just ordered from Butcher Bar tonight.&nbsp; I admit I was quite mad when I attempted to order from them for lunch and saw that they were closed for catering?&nbsp; Who does this?&nbsp; I tried 3 times before tonight.&nbsp; I guess curiosity got me and I do love bbq, so I decided to order to see how the food would travel.&nbsp; So I ordered at 6:30 and the food arrived at 7: 07, not bad considering my location and the man came on a bike.&nbsp; The packaging was not unique and might be used at other restaurants in the neighborhood.&nbsp; When I opened up the containers, the food was still quite hot and as I tasted the items, I was not disappointed!&nbsp; I had the pulled pork sandwich, a butcher&#039;s salad and today they had chili.&nbsp; Everything was great.&nbsp; I even got a call back from the owner to check on my delivery!&nbsp; Now that&#039;s quality service.&nbsp; I&#039;m going back tomorrow to try them in house.&nbsp; That&#039;s how good the food was.

				I went last night.&nbsp; The place is really hip, music and all.&nbsp; I&#039;m looking forward to trying pretty much everything on the menu.&nbsp; I had the burnt ends - most of which were good - there were alot of pieces that were really just fat.&nbsp; The salad was good as was the mac N cheese.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t care for the sweet potatoes or the regular potatoes - but that&#039;s just personal taste (odd flavorings), not them.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />They&#039;re going to have some pretty cool beers on tap within a few weeks.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />I&#039;ll definitely be back.

				I went there today and I thought it was really good! I didn&#039;t see fries on the menu, though, so they might not have fries. They have sweet potato wedges, potato salad, and a few other sides.<br /><br />I had the Bob&#039;s Burger, which is a 1/2 pound burger that includes ground brisket and <em>smoked bacon</em>. That&#039;s right, smoked bacon <em>in the burger</em>. I got it with sharp cheddar cheese on it. Honestly, I thought it would be kind of disgusting even though it sounded fascinating, but it was not disgusting at all. I ordered it medium rare, and it was medium rare. And it had just enough smoked bacon taste. It wasn&#039;t even greasy, although it was juicy. It was really good, and I didn&#039;t feel gross and fat even though I ate the whole thing. <br /><br />Please note that even though the description on the menu says it has BBQ sauced drizzled on it, it doesn&#039;t. I didn&#039;t want BBQ sauce drizzled on it, and when I asked the waitress that it not have BBQ sauce on it she said it doesn&#039;t. So yeah. The only thing is, I would&#039;ve liked an onion slice to put on the burger, and it only came with lettuce and tomato. That&#039;s my only complaint. And I think if I&#039;d asked for an onion slice, they probably would&#039;ve provided one. The coleslaw that came with it was good too.<br /><br />The place is nice and clean inside and the bathroom is nice.<br /><br />I would not describe the apple pie as orgasmic, but it was better than Entenmanns. The crust was a little soft but the flavor and texture of the apples was good.

				I didn&#039;t think the prices were unreasonable. The place isn&#039;t cheap, but the prices are fair for the quality of the food, and I left full and happy. It didn&#039;t strike me as one of those randomly overpriced restaurants we get around here sometimes. My brisket/bacon burger was $11, and it was 1/2 lb of good quality meat that was cooked perfectly. I felt like I paid a fair price. The hamburger bun isn&#039;t small - it&#039;s a standard sized bun - and I saw a pulled pork sandwich also. It has the same bun as the 1/2 pound burgers.

				I stopped by tonight with a friend and we were delighted to taste some truly delicious food, were treated well by the staff, and had an extended conversation with Matthew, the owner, as well as George, one of the other guys in charge, about the restaurant and general food philosophy. I love what they are doing and am so happy that a place of this quality has opened in Astoria. Eating healthy, humanely-raised, local, pastured meats is really important to me - being able to walk over to Butcher Bar instead of taking the train to The Meat Hook, is a super bonus for me. <br /><br /><br />I&#039;m also excited to see what else is coming from these guys - lunch, brunch, classes, opportunities to enjoy the outdoor space in the back, and more. Congratulations to the staff of Butcher Bar for bringing such a great establishment to our neighborhood!

And I cant wait till they finish the back area- it looks really cool (will be great when the weather warms up again), and they said they will have special roasts out in the back from time to time.

				Tried Butcher Bar a few weeks ago.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m sorry, but $8 for 6 pieces of &quot;burnt ends&quot; that were 75% fat and uneatable is NOT worth it.<br /><br />John Brown&#039;s Smokehouse.....ALL. THE. WAY.

				My husband and I were really surprised by how fatty the meats were.&nbsp; The burnt ends were seriously all fat. We also tried the pork belly (fatty but ok)&nbsp; and my husband said the pulled pork was fine.&nbsp; The mac and cheese was nothing to write home about and the potato salad was ALL mayo.<br /><br />No plans to eat here again.

				I finally actually had a meal at Butcher Bar. And WE LOVE IT!!!! I felt the prices are very reasonable.&nbsp; I had a half rack of ribs - the pricing is about average for average ingredients. But these ingredients are much more expensive than what most restaurants are sourcing. For the quality I feel the prices are low. <br />Our food wasn&#039;t fatty at all - and well - i&#039;m not really alarmed by fat. If you want lean - pork belly is not the way to go - pork belly IS mostly fat - you should consider trying a cut of beef as grass fed beef is very lean. Pastured pork is generally fattier than it&#039;s commercial counterpart because the farmers who raise it generally raise fattier heritage breeds. <br />We also had the &quot;Bob&#039;s burger&quot; which is 80/20 beef/bacon - and the&nbsp; bacon just melted into the&nbsp; burger. This burger doesn&#039;t need any adornment. Just great meat flavor.&nbsp; <br />We also had a couple of sides and all were quite tasty - the cole slaw was a little heavy on the mayo for me but that is personal. The mac and cheese was surprisingly good - i am always dispointed with this category. We also tried the yams and green beans. Full disclosure the owner sent those two items to our table for us to try and i would absolutely order them next time.<br />I can&#039;t wait to be back and expect to be a regular.<br />&nbsp;

				I think it&#039;s pretty common for burnt ends to be fatty, which is why I never order them. Not a fan of eating chunks of fat. The ones I saw at John Browns when I went there once looked very fatty as well. Some people actually do consider the fat edible, which is probably why they are served that way.

				I heard Butcher Bar is not real BBQ -- i.e. there&#039;s no real smoker or pit -- but John Brown&#039;s does have authentic BBQ.&nbsp; Can anybody respond to this and let me know if it&#039;s true or not?

				They are not a BBQ joint. They do smoke the bacon - but don&#039;t belive they have what you would consider the be &quot;real&quot; bbq equipment. They consider themselves a meat restaurant and are not trying to do authentic BBQ.

				After speaking to the owners several times, Butcher Bar is authentic barbeque.&nbsp; They use the same smoker JB uses.&nbsp; Only difference is that they use high quality meats.&nbsp; Grass fed, natural and localy sourced.&nbsp; They have so many more options than JB, furthermore after dining at both, my preferance is towards Butcher Bar based on the ambiance and most importantly sanitary and cleanlisness of their establishment.&nbsp; Great staff and service, high quality food, that you can taste the difference from the other guy.&nbsp; The guys at Butcher Bar had a connection to the pitmaster at JB, but chose chef Orlando&nbsp; based on his higher culinary pedigree and overall food iq.&nbsp; Fact is the pitmaster at JB was ready to jump ship on his own store and join Butcher Bar becomes he himself loved the facilities.&nbsp; His place cannot compare at all to Butcher Bar.&nbsp; Go taste for yourself, and let me know.&nbsp; I can&#039;t wait for what Butcher Bar has in store for Astoria in the future as well.&nbsp; They allready have a cult following and secured lucrative catering deals.&nbsp; Their future is bright.&nbsp; :smiley:

				Oh by the way HoneyBee, I guess you haven&#039;t ventured in, because the 2 (TWO) smokers are on display in their open kitchen, whereas poor JB&#039;s (1) one smoker is hidden inside.&nbsp; Rumor has it JB, doesnt cook in his smoker, because it&#039;s constantly breaking down, and cooks in his oven.&nbsp; Read the yelp reviews, for further insight this rumor.&nbsp;

				@ alipasa - not to devolve into corrections - but i didn&#039;t say they don&#039;t have smokers - I said they might not have what some people may consider &quot;real&quot; equipment - there is a huge divergence in bbq - and they told me they weren&#039;t trying to do a specific style - so their interpretation may not satisfy some. I am not a purist in the matter and just thrilled that they are doing such a good job!<br />&nbsp;

				Butcher Bar is also really cozy inside these days - when I was there it felt really good to be warm and toasty (it was a 30 something degree day that day). Everything was delicious - friends of mine who have gone have raved about it. I can&#039;t wait to eat there again!

				Tried them three times now, two burgers and a brisket.&nbsp; The burgers were well done but still juicy, which is rare (NPI)<br />Oddly when I ordered the brisket, the only bread they had was the roll the hamburger was on a seeded roll.&nbsp; Ever since diverticulitis I have been chary of seeds, but it&#039;s also odd, that with such a selection of meats there are no selections of breads.<br /><br />The layout is a little bit odd, with the wait staff having no direct line of sight to the customers, but it did not pose any problems the times I was there.&nbsp; The meat is good, but does someone with more a sense of the going rates know if they are high or average for their type of meat?<br /><br /><br />

				Finally tried Butcher Bar today. We went to John Brown&#039;s first, but they were sold out of burnt ends, rib tips, and pork belly by the time we got there, so left and decided to try BB. Overall consensus, eh. We got a sampler of 5 meats from the carvery along with a side of mac and cheese. Burnt ends weren&#039;t really burnt - just really ends. The few pieces that did have that nice crisp char on the outside were really good, but the rest was just solidly good. Best meat of our sampler though. Next was the pork belly, which was also good, but not great. Unfortunately the rest of the meats were dry, dry, dry. We got the hot sausage, which was&nbsp; (dry) and primarily heat with not a lot of flavor to balance it. The brisket was dry and had barely any smoked flavor. &quot;Smoked&quot; turkey was worst of all. No smoke flavor whatsoever and dry as dust. It was terrible. The cranberry sauce that went with it was way too sweet to be eaten, though the original bbq sauce did help redeem the brisket and turkey - or at least make them edible. Needing to put sauce on these meats was a shame - it&#039;s definitely a step down from Fette Sau in Brooklyn, where all of the meats are so good they stand on their own without any sauces whatsoever. Considering the price point to quality ratio we received at Butcher Bar, we won&#039;t be back. Here&#039;s hoping JB&#039;s will be better once we finally get over there when they have food to sell. Oh, and mac and cheese tasted like the Stouffer&#039;s mac and cheese that you get in the frozen food aisle, which, I can&#039;t lie, I do like, but wouldn&#039;t pay that much for at a restaurant.
