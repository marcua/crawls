				this is a great idea! the only knitting group i knew of in the lic area was too far away for me to get to on a regular basis. If you would like, it might be a smart idea to list it on the http://www.stitchnbitch.org/, or on Debbie Stoller's list- it's run through a yahoo group and has a listing of all the knitting groups in NYC. I know there's a few people from Astoria that might be interested in having a group locally!

				I am so glad that I decided to come and crochet with everyone. &nbsp; :D &nbsp;I am really enjoying it and its getting me out of my house. &nbsp;:P I wanted to share a few links with you, I was wondering if maybe we could make one of these as group project to work on like once a month or something. <br /><br />Warm Up, America!, sponsored by the Craft Yarn Council of America, is a wonderful – and wonderfully simple – way to get involved, even for those who are just beginning to knit or crochet. All that's necessary is a 7” x 9” knit or crochet rectangle. For more information, visit: www.warmupamerica.com . It's a great way for me to use up my leftover yarn that is too small for other projects.<br /><br /><br />Other things similar to this....<br /><br />National Organizations A perfect way to kick off this year’s list is with Care Wear, the group founded by this year’s Knitter of the Year, Bonnie Hagerman, who was profiled on last month’s “What’s New?” page. Contact them at: www.hood.edu/carewear/index.shtml &nbsp;<br /><br />Caps for Kids, another program sponsored by the Craft Yarn Council, provides warm hats for needy children. For a crocheted preemie hat and knitted child’s ski cap pattern and for more information, go to: www.CraftYarnCouncil.com/caps &nbsp;<br /><br />Warming Families is a group with many local chapters that donate blankets and other warm items to agencies serving the needs of homeless and displaced persons. For more information or to see where the nearest chapter is, check out their Website at www.WarmingFamilies.org<br /><br />A Project Linus blanket is like a big hug when you need one” reads the banner across the home page of this special organization. A group dedicated to making and donating blankets and quilts to needy children of all ages, Project Linus was named one of the “10 Children’s Charities That Deserve Your Support” by Parents’ magazine. To learn more, go to: www.ProjectLinus.org<br /><br />Millions of children have been orphaned by the AIDS epidemic in Africa, with South Africa among the hardest hit. Sunbeam Kids Foundation, a group in the Eastern Free State of that country, is working to aid these children, many of whom have are literally heads of their households. Babies’ and children’s sweaters and other garments are most welcome, as is donation of yarn, which is knitted locally into afghans and other items. The organization’s Website is: www.SunbeamKids.org.za<br /><br />Colleen

				the group is meeting!<br /><br />not many of us are there, but i am there with a crochet hook.<br /><br />last nite, august 4, myself and allison were there with our crochet hooks.<br /><br />for those who would like to join in the crafty goodness, be at the freeze peach sometime on thursday evenings. &nbsp;the original time for the group was 8pm. but i since have been getting there later from about 830pm-9pm. <br /><br />for those who already enjoy a craft, bring it along and we can all sit together. it's really informal. but it's great to sit with other crafters. it's almost like a support group.... can ask other members-- what color would look good with this? is this too much? should i take something away? how many more stiches should i do? things like that. <br /><br />for those who do not enjoy a craft yet and would like to learn... i'm a very bad teacher at crocheting---i'm left handed so it throws right handers off. i do not knit very well. i can teach you the basic knit and purl stitches. but that's all i know. increasing, decreasing, and other fancy things i cannot do. &nbsp;our ACK knitter hasnt been to this group for a little bit. :( <br /><br />if you are on a budget-- the bargain stop at 30th ave sometimes has yarns at a very good discount price (limited selection and colors). there's a few fabric/craft stores on ditmars blvd that have yarns too. dont forget to hit Micheal's at the northern boulevard stop on the R train. :) <br /><br />for those who enjoy other crafts such as jewlry making and paper crafts, bring that along. i'm sure we are all curious to see your work and admire it. <br /><br />that's another cool thing about the crafty group-- we can show off our things. it's very cathartic. :) <br /><br />contact me if you have anymore questions!<br /><br />Rosemary

				hello Annwynn...<br /><br />please join us on Thursday at 8:30pm at Freeze Peach cafe for another night of crafting!<br /><br />(to those who are on the email list, i think there is something wrong with the email program thingy, i've been sending messages out but i do not think that people are recieving them... argh!)<br /><br />i crochet, and i can help you out.<br />i know only basic knitting (casting on, knit stitch, purl stitch, but nothing else other than that)<br /><br />and you buying anyone tea for crafting lessons is<br />UNACCEPTABLE!!<br /><br />this is a lovely community group where we can share our talents with eachother. at no cost.<br /><br />crafting is priceless. :) <br /><br />Please join us for craft nite! <br />If you are a knitting, please come out to help as you would probably be a better teacher than I! <br />see you all on thursday!<br /><br />Rosemary<br />ack@astorians.net

				rock on!<br /><br />please join us tomorrow.<br /><br />if you plan on crocheting or knitting start off by buying a skein (ball of yarn) that is not all bumpy and funky looking, use worsted weight yarn. it looks like a normal ball of yarn. :) red heart super savers are great for beginners. and be sure to get yourself a color that is not too dark. it will be easier to see you stitches in a lighter color. (grays, pastels) <br /><br />if you are crocheting, be sure to purchase a J (6.5mm) hook.<br /><br />if you are knitting, get size 10 needles. <br /><br />get yerself a great cup of tea, and join us! :)<br /><br />Rosemary

				ok, so i suck?<br />i went really kinda early (7ish) and hung out and read the porn issue of time out ny and had a tea. knitted a bit and realized that this thing starts kickin way late for me! i was hoping someone would mozy on in early or something but no gots. oh well. Does it usually start alot later then 8? i left at around 8:15 figuring that next time i'll just go home and make dinner first then head on out around 8:30? sorry all, i was looking forward to some new knitting knowledge, but hey, theres always next week! and by then-mine will be the bestest little simplest scarf ever!<br /><br />haha<br />flooz

				I will be there to craft with you but I will also be listening to Adam Talk, he is giving a little thing tonight about what free software means. I can do both at the same time though. I always bring my crochet to technological brunch and watch TV while I crochet.<br /><br />Also Valentines is coming up, I was wondering if we are going to do valentines again like last year, Maybe on the 9th?

				i was wandering all over Astoria today and decided to stop into the &quot;Bargain Stop&quot; at 30th ave... it&#39;s a discount/variety store.<br /><br />well... i was disappointed that during the holidays that had no yarn.<br /><br />but when i walked in today..........YARN! <br />i almost pissed myself b/c they have a GREAT color selection of my favorite yarn <br />Kool Wool from Lion Brand (it&#39;s yummy 50% merino wool, and 50% acrylic) and they have it there for $1.99 which is a GREAT price (i think they sell for about 3.99).<br /><br />they also had the Jamie Baby yarn on sale for 99 cents.<br /><br />Lion Brand Homespun (limited colors) for $1.99 (i believe).<br /><br />so if you are beginning and wanted some inexpensive yarn to start out, that&#39;s the place to go!<br /><br />Rosemary

				Hey group,<br /><br />I just found this and was wondering if anyone can come or if you needed to sign up.. <br />I am a self taught knitter and I can pretty much only do straight lines :) I am working on hats and booties, but sweaters and other things are in my very distant future.&nbsp; I am looking forward to meeting my neighbors and picking up some hints.<br />Let me know when everyone meets and where.<br /><br />Thanks!<br />Destinee

				Hello Crafters!<br /><br />I&#39;ve noticed that there has been low attendance for the past few months at ACK Nites on Thursday evenings.<br /><br />I&#39;d welcome any feedback, suggestions, constructive criticism, changes that you would like to see in our group. I&#39;d love to see more of you come around. And I&#39;d love for your ideas to be put out there and be used for the benefit of our Crafty Group.<br /><br />Another idea that I have been throwing around with Colleen is that a few members have commented that the time of the group is late. How does meeting at 6pm or so sound? Colleen has offered to come earlier to welcome crafters, and we can just continue crafting throughout the evening.&nbsp; <br /><br />So please comment on what you would like to see going on at ACK that would have you attending more often. :) This is your group. <br /><br />Let&#39;s make it better!<br /><br />Please join us tomorrow at Freeze Peach Cafe at 8:30pm (tomorrow Thursday May 25, 2006) for another lovely evening of crafting at Freeze Peach Cafe. <br /><br />Rosemary

				Hello Crafters!!<br /><br />Well, after several people emailed me back, and other<br />verbal feedback... <br /><br />Colleen and I have decided to change meeting time for<br />our group. <br /><br />So please join us for another lovely evening of crafting at Freeze Peach Cafe today, <br /><div><strong>June 1, 2006 at the new time of 6pm !!!!!!!</strong></div><br />Colleen, our avid crocheter, will be at Freeze Peach to greet you.&nbsp; Colleen has been kind enough to greet crafters at this hour. Due to my crazy work schedule, I will almost NEVER be at Freeze Peach at that hour (i will come in later, dont worry!), but I just wanted to give other crafters in the community the opportunity to meet and craft, and be able to get home at a reasonable hour. <br /><br />Remember, this is a very informal group-- you do not have to be on time, or stay for a certain amount of hours... just show up between the hours of 6pm (when Colleen is there) and before 12am midnite (because Meesh closes up the place at that hour) and you will<br />be all good. :)<br /><br />Please pm/email me if you have any questions!<br /><br />Rosemary

				oops! <br /><br />I also wanted to direct all of you to this thread in case you missed it...<br /><br />I emailed the person and she gave me some information for those who wanted to sell their crafts... I think it would be a great thing to do, and the table fee is inexpensive! <br /><br />http://astorians.com/index.php?topic=2120.0

				Hi All, I received this message from some family members and thought it would be nice to pass around:<br /><br />Save the Children US has had a great response to their reserach that small, inexpensive solutions can save thousands of babies lives in their first days of life, like a little knitted cap to keep them warm. Lots of people are volunteering now and sending along caps they knitted -- for more info, see the link below: <br />&nbsp;<br />http://www.savethechildren.org/capstothecapital/index.asp?stationpub=i_hpb4_camp002&amp;ArticleID=&amp;NewsID= (http://www.savethechildren.org/capstothecapital/index.asp?stationpub=i_hpb4_camp002&amp;ArticleID=&amp;NewsID=)
