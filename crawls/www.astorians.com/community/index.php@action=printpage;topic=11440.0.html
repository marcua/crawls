				Ok, I have finished reading all my books and I am at a lost of books to read.&nbsp; Anyone have any suggestions on a good book to read.&nbsp; Nothing comes to my mind right now and I don&#039;t want to reread a book that is sitting on my shelf.&nbsp; No book is to big and I am willing to go out and buy it if necessary.

				what kind of books do you like?<br /><br />Here&#039;s a few I like<br /><br />Forever by Pete Hamill (historical fiction)<br />Of Human Bondage by Maugham (coming of age-type fiction)<br />His Dark Materials by Philip Pullman (3 book serious The Golden Compass, The Amber Spyglass and The Subtle Knife, these are fantasy youth novels, but they are amazing)<br />Smoke by John Ed Bradley (lighthearted humorous fiction)<br />The Day After Tomorrow not sure who it&#039;s by, but it&#039;s got nothing to do with that awful movie starring Donnie Darko. (murder mystery)<br /><br />Am I missing any categories?

				This is why god made libraries. So you can go poke around and pick up 3 or 4 books and take them all home. <br /><br />I have no idea what you like, but you might look at these:<br /><br />Good Omens, by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman<br />The Gun Seller, by Hugh Laurie<br />The Witches of Chiswick, by Robert Rankin<br />Glass Castle (nonfiction)<br /><br /><br />

				Although it came out in &#039;06, I just finished, &quot;Under the Banner of Heaven,&quot; by Jon Krakauer, detailing the rise of the Mormon Church.&nbsp; The subtitle is, &quot;A story of violent faith.&quot;&nbsp; It was a fascinating read.&nbsp; I also just read Christopher Ciccone&#039;s book about his sister, Madonna.&nbsp; That&#039;s a good beach book and conversation starter.&nbsp; Woody Guthrie&#039;s autobiographical, &quot;Bound For Glory&quot; was another recent read, and it too, was great.

				I&#039;m a little tardy since I was wrapped up in school for years on end, but I&#039;m plugging through Stephen King&#039;s The Dark Tower series. <strong>Love. It.</strong> I&#039;m only on book two and I&#039;m hooked. I&#039;ve been into comics recently, probably because of King&#039;s involvement with The Stand and The Dark Tower books. Graphic novels are where it&#039;s at for me. A few I would suggest: Watchmen (the movie is coming out soon!), A League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (better than the movie), American Splendor (better than the movie, but I liked the movie on its own) and Battle Royale (again, better than the movie if that&#039;s possible).<br /><br />Real books I&#039;m into: <br />Michael Chabon&#039;s The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay<br />E.L. Doctorow&#039;s World&#039;s Fair (very relevant and very cool)<br />Weiss&#039; Lucky Wander Boy<br />Anything by Tim Dorsey - Florida Roadkill is his first and he kinda writes them in series<br />If you&#039;re up for it, Ayn Rand&#039;s stuff usually evokes the objectiveness in me<br /><br />What a fun thread.

I especially love <em>American Gods</em>. <br /><br />Let&#039;s see, a few of my other favorites:<br /><br />- Middlesex by Jeffrey Eugenides<br /><br />- Partly Cloudy Patriot and Assassination Vacation both by Sarah Vowell<br /><br />- Arcadia by Stoppard (play)<br /><br />- Pride and Prejudice <br /><br />- The Thursday Next series by Jasper Fforde<br /><br />- Stephen Sondheim: A Life by Meryle Secrest (one of my more recent reads and really mostly appeals to Sondeim/musical theatre fans, but I still thought I&#039;d throw it out there)<br />- Brideshead Revisited by Waugh (a new film adaptation is coming out soon)<br /><br /><br />Like kerrigankrewe, I&#039;m also into graphic novels/comics.&nbsp; In that catagory I&#039;d recommend:<br /><br />- second kerrigankrewe&#039;s rec. for Watchmen.&nbsp; It&#039;s a must for anyone who&#039;s interested the superhero genre of comics. As even the movie trailer boasts, it&#039;s the &quot;most celebrated [superhero] graphic novel ever.&quot;<br /><br />- Y:The Last Man and Ex Machina, both by Brian K. Vaughn.&nbsp; &#039;Y&#039; is now a completed story at ten volumes worth of trades, but Ex Machina is still ongoing.&nbsp; I believe it is at vol. 6 as far as trades go.<br /><br />- Alias by Brian Bendis. <br /><br />-&nbsp; Runaways created and written by Brian K. Vaughn (first two volumes) and Joss Whedon is currently writing it. <br /><br />- Skyscrapers of the Midwest by Josh W.

				<strong>Non-Fiction</strong><br /><br />&quot;A Splendid Exchange: How Trade Shaped The World&quot; - William Bernstein<br />I think history and economics go hand in hand - you can&#039;t truly understand one without the other. This book is great. I&#039;m almost finished with it, so if you put it on your request list a the library you can be next in line.<br /><br />&quot;Discover Your Inner Economist&quot; - Tyler Cowen<br />Less historical and more psychology, but it&#039;s still good. The guys blog is a good read - marginalrevolution.com<br /><br />&quot;Undercover Economist&quot; - Tim Hartford<br />Great overview for the uninitiated.<br /><br />&quot;John Adams&quot; - Douglas McCoullough<br />Awesome book, one of my favorites by McCoullough.

				i second the recommendations for Persepolis and the Thursday Next series. <br /><br /><br />Another great work from the graphic novel section is &quot;Fun Home,&quot; by Alison Bechdel (who also writes the comic strip &quot;Dykes to Watch Out For.&quot;)<br /><br />&quot;Fun Home&quot; is simply brilliant. Thoughful, honest, intelligent. <br /><br />I also recommend anything at all by Herman Hesse.

				<strong>Fiction</strong><br /><br />Love Jasper Fforde (Thursday Next series, Nursery Crime series).<br /><br />Philippa Gregory (she does more historical novels focusing mostly on the female characters) - Wideacre Trilogy, etc.<br /><br />A Spot of Bother by Mark Haddon (He wrote A Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, which I totally loved)<br /><br />The Pale Blue Eye by Louis Bayard (a detective story with Edgar Allen Poe as one of the main characters)<br /><br />The Lovely Bones (one of my favorite books, but can&#039;t remember the author name right off hand)<br /><br />I&#039;ll also echo His Dark Materials, although at this point I&#039;ve only read The Golden Compass (which I loved).<br /><br /><strong>Non-fiction</strong><br /><br />A Strange Piece of Paradise by Terri Jentz who was nearly murdered on a bike trip. <br /><br />I am currently reading The Monsters by Dorothy and Thomas Hoobler. It&#039;s not the most riveting book, but it is interesting. It is a biography of several people, including Mary Shelley (Frankenstein), who were writers and who were intertwined in each others&#039; lives. If you think you have problems...<br /><br />Sala&#039;s Gift by Ann Kirschner - About Ann&#039;s mother, Sala, and her family during the Holocaust.<br /><br />Conservatize Me by John Moe - Very funny read, esp. if you&#039;re a liberal.<br /><br />If I am Missing or Dead by Janine Latus - Written by a murdered woman&#039;s sister. Fairly depressing.

				WOW!!!!&nbsp; Thanks everyone for the suggestions.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t expect such a big response.&nbsp; Please keep them coming..I am always looking for a good read.<br /><br />As far as genre, I read just about everything so I am not picky.&nbsp; Lately I have been reading a lot of things about WWII, but I am starting to get burned out on it a little.&nbsp; I just finished The Winds of War and War and Rememberence.&nbsp; Great books that I would definetly recommend but now I want to watch the miniseries.<br /><br />If it helps, I love history, espically wars (no I don&#039;t want war, just like reading and learning about them).&nbsp; I used to read a lot of Sci Fi and it has been awhile since I read some.<br /><br />Again...thanks everyone and keep the suggestions coming.

				A few that I have loved lately are:<br /><br />Field Notes on a Catastrophe by Elizabeth Kolbert (an ex Times journalist who wrote a series for the New Yorker which became the foundation for this book on climate change)<br /><br />Remainder by Tom McCarthy<br /><br />Plague of Doves by Louise Edrich<br /><br />The Gathering by Anne Enright (first Irish woman to ever win the Booker)<br /><br />The Beautiful Things That Heaven Bears by Dinaw Mengestu <br /><br />The Book of Disquiet by Fernando Pessoa (he is a great but until recently overlooked Portuguese poet who out of nowhere had a Times piece written about him not too long ago)<br /><br />Lincoln&#039;s Melancholy by Joshua Wolf Shenk (a great more psychological look at Lincoln)<br /><br />Hope that helps, and if a book club ever does materialize I would certainly be interested!

				just in case anyone was wondering...I started reading &quot;The Art of Racing in the Rain&quot;.&nbsp; Yes, before you ask, that is the book that Starbucks is selling.&nbsp; It is an easy read and I will be done with it very quickly.&nbsp; So far it is very well written but very very sad.&nbsp; If you are a dog lover, I would suggest it.&nbsp; It will make you look differently at your dog.

				Some of my favorites:<br /><br />Memories of my Melancholy Whores by Gabriel Garcia Marquez<br /><br />Timoleon Vieta Come Home by Dan Rhodes<br /><br />Snow Flower and the Secret Fan by Lisa See<br /><br />The Secret Life of Bees by Sue Monk Kidd<br /><br />The Known World by Edward P. Jones<br /><br />Blackbird by Jennifer Lauck<br /><br />Children of the Flames by Lucette Matalon Lagnado<br /><br />The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison<br /><br />Night by Elie Wiesel<br /><br />I am a Pencil by Sam Swope<br /><br />One True Thing by Anna Quindlen<br /><br />Sybil by Flora Rheta Schreiber<br /><br />Memory Keepers Daughter by Kim Edwards<br /><br />These are only a few but I definitely recommend. Children of the Flames and Night are books that chronicle the experience of those during the Holocaust. Timoleon Vieta didn&#039;t have good reviews online which is what drew me to it initially and I loved it. It created lots of emotion from within. The Known World is a fictional historical look at slavery. Snow Flower and the Secret Fan is an emotional journey into the lives of Chinese girls within their traditional cultural expectations. As a mother, after reading I am Pencil I felt compelled to do all that this teacher did for his 5th graders. I wish I had a teacher like him when I was in school at that age. Reading Sybil was difficult but only because it made me sad and angry for the main character. Memory Keepers Daughter which reminded me that no one can disturb the connection a mother has with those that she brings into this world. There is nothing stronger than the unknown that connects us to our children. One child can&#039;t ever replace another. Last, One True Thing hit home since my mom was ill as well as I read this book. I could relate to all that is involved with taking care of the mother that goes from supermom to frail mom. <br /><br />I hope this helps and truly enjoy all that you read.<br /><br /><br /><br />
