				I&#39;m from Bridgeport, CT (it&#39;s on the water, about 1/2 way between Stamford and New Haven). Not NYC, or even NY State, but I still consider it part of the NYC area (its 45-60 minutes in the car). And, I would get New York and Hartford/New Haven tv channels - so CBS is 2 and 3, NBC is 4 and 6, ABC is 7 and 8, FOX is 5 and 25...I think we might have even had 3 UPNs. And yes, I&#39;ve had conversations with my dad about which ABC is &quot;better&quot;, even though they&#39;re exactly the shows (news was different though, obviously). I preferred 8 for regular programmingbecause the colors were a bit more saturated. Bizarre.<br /><br />I commuted to school here on Metro-North for a couple years (I was working full time in Bpt as well, so I&#39;m sure that had something to do with my stress levels), and after that soul-sucking expierence, I decided to move. I&#39;m glad I did! <br /><br />Oh, and merm will usually move misplaced threads. We love that big shiny tomato head of his&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				From Long Island and moved here four years ago. Transition was rough at first and the lack of property was frustrating. Now I wouldn&#39;t move back east of Astoria&#39;s borders. In fact, my parents house on long island creeps me out with the lack of people and quiet streets....eerie..

				Born in Michigan (lived there six weeks), moved to San Jose, moved to Connecticut, then Pennsylvania, then back to the San Jose area. Went to college in Santa Cruz and then lived in San Francisco before going to graduate school in Ithaca. lived in Yokohama for one year, lived in Bloomington, IN for just over three, then Kyoto for three and half before ending up in Astoria.&nbsp; Every move after the one to Ithaca has been largely unanticipated, and the move to Astoria and New York the most surprising of all.

				Austin has become the new So Cal (except for the weather as of late, it&#39;s only 32 there today and icy) because you can still buy a house and afford to live for less than eleventy-billion dollars and the weather&#39;s great.<br /><br />They&#39;re planning on another million people coming into the metro area in the next 20 years.&nbsp; So, if ya got some extra money and like investing in real estate, I&#39;d recommend it.<br /><br />I really loved the place.&nbsp; It was an amazing city with a great life to it, great people, great weather, and a ton of things to do.&nbsp; However, it&#39;s no New York City and, while AFD is a great department, FDNY is the top.&nbsp; I couldn&#39;t pass up the chance to experience NYC and the opportunity to work for FDNY.&nbsp; However, should it not work out or, if I decide that warmer weather (usually) is more important, then I&#39;ll definitely be going back there.

				I grew up in Colchester(next to Burlington), Vermont, and have lived in Boston for the last twelve years, and am moving to Astoria on Feb.5th. I was at the Waltz last Tuesday, what a great place. After looking at a few places in other neighborhoods, I got an immediate good feeling about Astoria.

				Just now catching up on this topic!<br /><br />I was born in Florida (gasp!) but moved to Texas when I was quite young, so thankfully I don&#39;t remember much of it. Lived in Fort Worth until college, went to school in College Station, TX (seriously that&#39;s the name of the town), about 1.5 hrs north of Houston. Then to Austin for a year, then to Astoria for 3 months, to BK for 2 years (windsor terrace), then back to Astoria, where I&#39;ve been for 1.5 yrs.<br /><br />I&#39;ve got another home base in northern Louisiana as well, where my dad has lived since I was 7 or 8, so I&#39;ve spent a lot of time there too.<br /><br />Someday I&#39;ll be back in Austin, but as far as the greater NYC area, Astoria is it for me, so I&#39;m staying right here.

				Native Astorian here!&nbsp; Also posted my first hello in the &quot;hello&quot; thread...anyhow...I was born in 1984 in Boulevard Hospital, which I believe turned into a private medical clinic soon afterwards. A lot of folks here seem to have bounced around the state, country or world even, but I&#039;ve mostly bounced around within Astoria, going from the Steinway and 34th Ave area over to 46th Street and Broadway, then north to Steinway and 21st Avenue before migrating back south to 28th south of Broadway, and finally my final stop in Astoria, Ditmars and Crescent, right on the corner.&nbsp; My first detour was to live out on Long Island while going to school at Stony Brook, and the second detour was my family moving to Flushing, where I now am as well for the time being, as I&#039;m just about done with my Masters at Stony and no loner need to live out there fulltime!&nbsp; Neither LI nor Flushing comes close to Astoria and fortunately, it&#039;s close enough that I&#039;m back often!

				Let&#039;s see, I was born and raised in Syracuse (go Orange).&nbsp; Moved to NYC in 1998 for school (go Rams), and had 4 different, but equally impressive university apartments like 2 blocks from Columbus Circle.<br />After that I moved to Brooklyn for a year, and came to Astoria in 2002/2003 and have been here since.&nbsp; I&#039;m now on 44th street, somewhere between broadway and astoria blvd with my girlfriend.&nbsp; <br />I like adventures (especially food adventures), my bike, and my new, stylish spectacles.&nbsp;

				No way, where did all these lovely Minnesotans come from (ah all the interesting yet nice midwesterners move to Astoria)?

				From: Seattle, Washington.&nbsp; <br />Been in Astoria (Ditmars area) for all of 2 1/2 weeks now. <br /><br />Brief chronological summation of my stay in NY thus far: 1. Graduated from school in summer of &#039;06 (Washington State Univ.).&nbsp; 2. Moved to Hoboken w/ college girlfriend roughly 10 months ago.&nbsp; 3. Landed a good job in the city.&nbsp; 4. Broke up with gf.&nbsp; 5. Decided to stay in NY area nonetheless.&nbsp; 6. Found a reasonably priced studio on craigslist in Astoria, NY.<br /><br />In my short stint in Astoria I&#039;d have to say there are more positives than negatives.&nbsp; Much is undiscovered as of yet.<br /><br />Also, my ancestors are Greek, so my last name apparently affords me some instant street-cred around the &#039;hood.&nbsp; I know nothing of Greek culture, however, but that&#039;s hardly common knowledge.<br /><br />See ya around the forum, all.

				Raised in the Bronx, lived most of my childhood in Woodside, Queens then moved out to Astoria and lived there for 6 years before moving to &gt;blech&lt; Teaneck, NJ which I regret to this day. I really miss Astoria.&nbsp; :cry:&nbsp; I really missed out in all the changes that have been going in Astoria. I would walk around with my wife and say &quot;You&#039;ll see in five years, this area is going to change in ways you&#039;ve never imagined&quot; and I was right.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I didn&#039;t follow my gut instincts and purchase a co-op at the time when the market was good and bought a house in Jersey instead. Boy what a dumb mistake that was.&nbsp; :oops:<br /><br />So I wander here to check what&#039;s going on and offer some wisdom on Astoria and of Queens whenever I can.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)
