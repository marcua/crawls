				I currently live in the basement of a one-family home in Astoria, Queens, NY. Just a couple weeks ago, my landlord decided that he wants the basement back for himself and the family. Perfect timing! I am not in the financial situation to be moving right now. And things are getting expensive in Astoria, I just love this neighborhood, Ditmars area of Astoria. So that&#39;s why I&#39;m considering a room mate right now. It will save me money, and maybe I won&#39;t have such a crappy space if I share a place with someone. (just went apartment hunting today. obviously, my budget allows me to see only tiny places.) My budget right now is: $850. Total. I can go a little bit over on splitting utils, etc, but not much. <br /><br />I am a 26 year old female who works as a foster care and adoption Social Worker. As you can probably imagine, it&#39;s a very stressful job, especially in the past few mos. I usually leave the apt at 8:30am..... supposed to be back by 6pm, but my job many times has me back in Astoria at about 7:30-8pm. <br /><br />Ideal would be to have a private bathroom. But, alas, thos are rare. I would prefer to share a bathroom with only ONE other person. Someone who can be neat and share responsibilities of cleaning the common areas would be fabulous. <br /><br />I&#39;m not a noisy person. I have my own television and DVD player and would do that stuff in my room. I enjoy listening to my music at a reasonable level. I enjoy crafting--- I&#39;m an avid crocheter. So I have tons of yarn and supplies. If you are cool, I&#39;ll make you something. :) I also do henna/mehendi body art. In my own place, I was able to host small henna parties for my female friends. (about 6 total people over) and would like to continue doing this in the future, and you can get henna too. :) Henna party means lots of tea drinking, middle eastern desserts, and middle eastern music. This would happen maybe 4 times per year. <br /><br />I do not enjoy drinking alcohol very much. If I do drink alcohol, it is when my friends invite me out to socialize, and I do it elsewhere. I do not tolerate the use of any use of illegal drugs, or illegal use of prescription drugs--- I do not like it when people smoke Pot. I would prefer a room mate who feels the same way I do on this topic. Well then. Other than that, I&#39;m a pretty cool, intelligent, professional with a Master&#39;s Degree. I am very interested in social justice issues, have very strong feelings about the current political administration (I very much dislike them). I enjoy living in NY very much and being able to enjoy the diversity that is Astoria, Queens-- between food, culture, people, art, nightlife. It&#39;s a wonderful place. Get in touch if you think you are the room mate for me!! :) <br />

				hi what&#39;s doin? i don&#39;t have a place, but if you find a place i might make a good roomie. trying to stay under $700. below is what i send out to folks on craigslist:<br /><br />hi. i&#39;m interested in you and your place. i am 34, nice, <br />intelligent, fun, honest, artistic, straight, cleaner than<br />most, and easy to get along with. i can<br />be very social and funny, but i like my own space sometimes too.<br />i work in a financial firm in midtown, but that does not define me. <br />i am primarily an opera/classical singer making a go of it in nyc, so i do auditions <br />periodically and gig on the side. i even won the metropolitan opera&#39;s <br />competition and hold a post-graduate degree.<br /><br />i am hoping to find my own room somewhere close to<br />midtown. this room would--in the best-of-all-possible <br />apartment sharing worlds--come with a door, be big<br />enough for a double bed and a desk, have internet, and<br />be nearby a tv with cable. furnished or unfurnished is<br />fine. <br /><br />i need to avoid cats, dogs, inside smoking, and drugs.<br /><br />I like living with women or men, and get along with<br />most people easily. i might have occasional visitors,<br />but not often. (overnight needs to be a possibility,<br />if very infrequent.) I am gay/lesbian-friendly too, if that applies.<br /><br />basically you wouldn&#39;t have any problems with me<br />because i&#39;m responsible and you might even make a good<br />friend. the opera is the only weird thing, and i don&#39;t fit that stereotype anyway. <br />&nbsp;<br />;-)<br />&nbsp;<br />hoping to hear from you.<br /><br />philip<br />917 684 4222

				Are you still in the market for a roomate? My price range and living habits/criteria are similar to yours. <br />Write back if you&#39;d like to discuss further.<br /><br />Thanks! :)
