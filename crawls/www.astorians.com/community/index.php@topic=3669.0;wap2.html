			Ok folks, <br /><br />So whats it gonna take to have a green market in, say Athens Square Park, in 2007? Do we need to get the ball rolling now? Any ideas?<br /><br />-JoeMo :)

			All my calls and emails to the Council on the Environment have been ignored.&nbsp; I will stop by in person next time I&#39;m downtown and see if I can get their attention that way.

			That&#39;s disappointing that calls weren&#39;t returned. They have an email link on their website; I doubt they&#39;d be more receptive to email than phone calls but I can email and try.<br /><br />I&#39;d LOVE to have a greenmarket at Athens Square Park; I&#39;d get on board with trying to make this happen (if we can get an answer or figure out how).

			To get a greenmarket into a neighborhood - you need to get the support and approval of the local businesses.&nbsp; &nbsp;I haven&#39;t asked any of them - but I just don&#39;t think that the string of veggie stands and the supermarket are going to jump on the greenmarket bandwagon.&nbsp; &nbsp;:cry:

			I wonder if they&#39;d also think it&#39;s too close to the other tiny Greenmarket in Astoria - 31st Ave and 14th St, I think? I think it&#39;s only there for part of the year. <br /><br />Oh well, I&#39;m going to still email and see....
