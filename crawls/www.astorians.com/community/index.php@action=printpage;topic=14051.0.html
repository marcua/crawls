				Recently there has been a lot of activity at 45th and Ditmars. The new deli La Familia finally opened up and this morning, I noticed that the old Euros restaurant on the corner has a new awning. It seems there is a new restaurant and bakery opening in its space? Anyone have any info?

				Updating the little info I have....<br /><br />In the old Euros space is now Botero Restaurant and Bakery....Looks like possibly Colombian food but is not open for business quite yet.<br />I did walk into the new La Familia Deli which is next door. Small, but I imagine will carry more as they get going.

				Botero&#039;s opens today. They were handing out free samples yesterday, and the cookie I got was tasty. The deli is decent- friendly service, not a huge selection, but it seems nice enough.

				We&#039;ve been getting a few things from Botero&#039;s in the past two days, and I have to say it looks promising. It seems to be a combo of items from several South American countries. They offer empanadas and have arepas on the menu (which due to a printing error was only available in Spanish over the weekend, so I could only glean little bits from it), neither of which I&#039;ve tried, but am excited about trying. All of the bread items we&#039;ve bought have been amazingly light and fluffy and excellent when dipped in a cup of coffee.
