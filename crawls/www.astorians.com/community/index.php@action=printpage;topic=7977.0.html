				My pool team -6 of us- is losing our beginner player and we need someone to replace her!&nbsp; We&#039;re looking for a beginner, we can&#039;t have anyone above that level.&nbsp; If you&#039;re interested in playing in a weekly evening match and can show up reliably and want to learn how to play pool please PM me.&nbsp; It&#039;s about $15/night, in Astoria, the matches go from about 7 to midnight (no you won&#039;t actually be playing that long, the players on the teams rotate matches, not shots).&nbsp; No experience necessary (and preferred), you just have to want to play, have a personality, and enjoy the company of the awesomeness that is our team.&nbsp; Again, there&#039;s no performance expectation, I&#039;m thinking about implementing a &#039;loser wins a beer policy&#039;, because it&#039;s just a game.&nbsp; We play 8-ball and 9-ball, if you don&#039;t know what that is, GOOD!&nbsp; PM me and I&#039;ll share the rest of the details and you can come meet the team.&nbsp; <br />

				I had been on a pool team for 6 years and it was a lot of fun.&#160; I mention this here as pool teams are a great way meet and interact with other people. Anyone who has wanted to learn pool should jump at this chance.<br /><br />And take it from me, Josh is a real cool guy and anyone would be lucky to be on his team.&nbsp; Besides, he&#039;s got a great dispostion and trust me, I just don&#039;t give compliments out.&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;And&quot; we both grew up in the same town out on Long Island. <br />

				The spot remains open!&nbsp; Our teammates range between mid-20&#039;s and mid 30&#039;s, but the league is 18+ with a sprinkling of retirees.
