				You know, I really wanted to like Juno, but when I was talking to a friend the other day about it, I realized what bugged me about the movie. Diablo Cody was far, far, FAR too concerned with convincing us how clever and cool she is. She went to an 11 on the clever meter, when an 8 or 9 would have been perfect. I really did love the performances, but I just think she went a bit overboard.<br /><br />Anyway, I unfortunately have nothing to recommend - I&#039;m a Netflix girl, (I rarely make it to the theaters), so everything I&#039;m watching is old news.

				I agree with you ^ about Juno.&nbsp; Tried way too hard.<br /><br />No Country was great.<br /><br />There Will Be Blood started off fantastic then went downhill.&nbsp; Definitely worth seeing though.<br /><br />Sweeny Todd was good.<br /><br />La Vie En Rose is the best movie I saw all year.

				I appreciate the comments on Juno.<br />The film seemed to me to succeed even though the charming character is so quirky.<br />[And if you like the direction, maybe see also Thank You for Smoking]<br /><br /><br />Glad for the caution about There Will Be Blood. Still will likely see it.<br /><br /><br />I wanted to like La Vie en Rose more. A great central performance. A bit of a strange &#039;MTV&#039; movie about an older chanteuse. But overall, the screenplay did not work at all for me.<br /><br /><br />If you like the Coen brothers see No Country, but dont be surprised if it does not live up to the hype. Much of it is wonderfully intense.<br /><br />

				<strong><em>Sweeney Todd</em></strong> was excellent despite the cuts to the songs and the lack of a chorus.&nbsp; <strong><em>Atonement</em></strong> was awesome.<br /><br />I have a serious weakness for costume movies.

The Irish romance &quot;Once,&quot; which won for best limited release film and best musical, scored 98 percent.<br /><br /><br /><br />&quot;Atonement&quot; scored the Golden Tomato for romance. &quot;The Bourne Ultimatum&quot; won in the action/adventure category, &quot;Juno&quot; was the best comedy and &quot;No Country for Old Men&quot; the best thriller.<br /><br /><br /><br />&quot;Away From Her&quot; was named best drama, &quot;Sicko&quot; won best documentary and &quot;Grindhouse&quot; was the top horror flick. &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot; took a Tomato for science-fiction/fantasy and &quot;Enchanted&quot; won best family film. &quot;The Lives of Others&quot; was the top foreign film.<br /><br /><br /><br />The Moldy Tomato — awarded to the worst-reviewed film of the year — was thrown at &quot;Because I Said So.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;:-P<br />

				I just saw Juno and must say I thought it was an excellent movie.&nbsp; &nbsp;(I am, in general, a dour fellow when it comes to most movies.&nbsp; The guilty pleasure I listed on the forum a bit ago is to read bad movie reviews).&nbsp; I think it could have been great, but I do agree in part with Allison&#039;s comments.&nbsp; <br /><br />Immature note:&nbsp; I liked in it spite of Jason Bateman, who is a good actor but I just harbored an immature grudge against him since Arrested Development (how Michael Bluth could walk around, let alone run a company, with such a big cross on his back is beyond me).&nbsp; But he was excellent in Juno.

				<br />http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405094/<br /><br />Just recently caught the Lives of Others.<br />&nbsp;:?<br /><br />A very well made film about life behind the Iron Curtain.<br />It is a very cool film about a time and place that seems very distant yet recent history.<br />Strong story. Very good lead performance.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Remember, &#039;if you see something, say something.&#039;

				spoiler speculation<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;the Academy Awards are on this weekend<br />amateur predictions indicate some very likely winners<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />No Country<br />Coen brothers<br /><br />Daniel Day Lewis<br />Julie Christie<br /><br />Javier Bardem<br />Cate Blanchett<br /><br /><br />A lot is deserved.

				Glad for the &#039;upsets&#039;.<br /><br /><br />Clayton is very well made. Excellent but strange characters.<br /><br />Hooray for the strangers. A world of acting talent.

				I loved Marion and her performance was terrific.<br /><br /><br />But....if you haven&#039;t seen Julie Christie&#039;s work in Away From Her, you might<br />understand why I was rooting for her last nite. Her performance was so subtle<br />and just brilliant. Plus it was an amazing achievement for a young, first-time<br />director who adapted the screenplay from a short story.<br /><br />Rent it and see what you think.....

				<br />MATTHEW : <br />One day I said: &quot;I got a joke for you. ... You&#039;re dead.&quot; <br />He said, &quot;It&#039;s not funny.&quot; <br />I said: &quot;Let me tell the joke. Steven Spielberg&#039;s dead, too.&quot; He said, &quot;Steven&#039;s dead, oh, that&#039;s funny.&quot; <br /><br /><br />And I said: &quot;You&#039;re dead and you&#039;re up in heaven and Steven Spielberg has just died and he&#039;s being greeted at the gate by Gabriel and Gabriel says: &#039;God&#039;s really dug a lot of your movies and he wants to make sure that you&#039;re comfortable. If there&#039;s anything you need, you come to me, I&#039;m your man.&#039; And Steven says, &#039;Well, you know, I always wanted to meet Stanley Kubrick, do you think you could arrange that?&#039; And Gabriel looks at him and says: &#039;You know, Steven, of all the things that you could ask for, why would you ask for that? You know that Stanley doesn&#039;t take meetings.&#039; He says, &#039;Well, you said that if there was anything I wanted.&#039; Gabriel says: &#039;I&#039;m really sorry. I can&#039;t do that.&#039; <br /><br />So now he&#039;s showing him around heaven and Steven sees this guy wearing an army jacket with a beard riding a bicycle. And Steven says to Gabriel: &#039;Oh, my God, look, over there, that&#039;s Stanley Kubrick. Couldn&#039;t we just stop him and say hello?&#039; And Gabriel pulls Steven to the side and says, &#039;That&#039;s not Stanley Kubrick; that&#039;s God -- he just thinks he&#039;s Stanley Kubrick.&#039; &quot;<br /><br />Stanley liked that joke.<br /><br />http://www.nytimes.com/library/magazine/home/19990704mag-kubrick-profile.html<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;:-D<br />
