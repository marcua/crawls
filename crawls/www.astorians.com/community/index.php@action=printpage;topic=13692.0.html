				<br />http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/01/15/us/politics/20090115_HOPE.html<br /><br />by way of SwissMiss, this link shares a number of Hopes from a variety of Americans.<br />If you click on the popular tab, the hopes get arranged. If you agree with some of the wishes, you can add your hope to the hope count. And you can see some comments from various states for each category.<br /><br />I like the presentation.<br />At the moment, I wonder if World Peace or National Security will crack the top 10 and top 20.<br />Here&#039;s hoping. And at least Limited Govt cracks the top 30.

Not having W as a president. <br />2. Having a president who appears to be intelligent, cautious, and interested in creating policy based on real information. <br />3. Having a president who is more friendly to women&#039;s rights and to gay rights than his predecessor.<br />4. Having a black president. I seriously did not believe that was at all possible. This tells me something completely new about the world I live in. <br /><br />etc etc etc<br /><br />Admittedly there&#039;s a lot of emotion around the Obama presidency that will likely subside as reality sets in and he disappoints us for the first time, the second time, ... the hundredth. I&#039;m really happy that he won and that he&#039;s our president, but I know he&#039;s going to f*** up in some big ways and I&#039;m dreading that but also kind of curious to see how. <br /><br />Suggesting that people don&#039;t understand where their feelings are coming from seems a little condescending to me. Maybe you didn&#039;t mean it that way? I think it&#039;s more likely that other people&#039;s attempts to explain to you why they are excited, assuming they have done so, assuming that you&#039;ve walked up to a democrat and said &quot;can you help me understand why you are so psyched&quot; and they&#039;ve really tried to explain while you&#039;ve really tried to understand, have fallen flat for you - and it makes sense that they would. If you were excited about the same things as Dems, you would be a Dem :)

Really, how many liberals could figure out how Bush managed to get voted into office not even just once, but twice? I truly did not understand how people could support Bush, and how even 22% managed to feel positively about him in the end. But some people clearly did, and you know, they probably understood why they did also. <br /><br />I personally am excited to have a president who is genuinely concerned about women&#039;s rights and the environment. After enduring eight years of Bush&#039;s feelings about those things, honestly it seemed impossible to me that we&#039;d ever have a president again who&#039;d feel that those issues had any sort of importance. While I was always skeptical of Obama&#039;s words during the campaign simply because it was a campaign, his actions since taking office have already made clear that he meant what he said on those subjects. I don&#039;t expect him to be perfect, but I do think he&#039;s given solid reason for people to be hopeful and excited. The reason it seems so extreme at this point is because millions of people have felt utterly hopeless about our country while Bush was president. If you generally supported Bush or just didn&#039;t think he was all that bad, no, you would not understand where this is coming from.

				I can agree with you that Obama has incredible charisma and that after 8 years of discouragement he&#039;s a sight for sore eyes. <br /><br />The founders would be aghast at the voting population. There be wimmins in it! <br /><br />I understand your concerns about what I consider civic responsibility - taking issues seriously, making an effort to understand the issues, etc - but I&#039;m not convinced that these are new issues or that it&#039;s never been this bad before. I do think that for democracy to function well we need education on civic responsibility, and critical thinking. <br /><br />However, the argument of how the founding fathers might see things is not a powerful one for me. It may be valuable to consider it, but it&#039;s not a deciding factor. Our society is, or tries to be, far more inclusive than theirs, and we have to find new ways to make it work.

But some people clearly did, and you know, they probably understood why they did also. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I think that there is a world of difference between the 2000 and 2004 elections. This will probably always be the case between a race with no incumbents and one where someone is running for reelection. In 2000 GWB ran on a platform against &quot;nation building&quot; which was a shot at the Clinton efforts in Somalia and the former Yugoslavia. I liked what I heard since I have always been against the idea of policing the World. He ran as a &quot;uniter&quot; who did, in fact, get both parties to play nicely in Texas. I am against all thing that are considered bipartisan, so this didn&#039;t appeal to me but others may like it. He spoke of &quot;compassionate conservatism&quot; as if conservatism is inherently not compassionate.&nbsp; But he also ran as a small government budget hawk, and that appeals to me also. And he ran against Al Gore, who came across as hugely unlikable in my view. <br />Then 9/11 Happened<br />Then we were asked wether or not to change courses in the War on Terrorism. I was not willing to do that with John Kerry. So I voted for Bush again. I held my nose and ignored the huge increases in the federal deficit and justified it by thinking that Kerry would do the same. I ignored the incredible usurpation of responsibility in the area of education because that was a &quot;bipartisan&quot; issue. I figured that the largest government expansion of government entitlements since Roosevelt is the way the nation wants to go anyway. So the prescription plan wasn&#039;t enough to throw me overboard. <br />I am not normally a one issue voter. And I will change my mind when presented with a better argument. But for better or worse we were in the middle of a war that was badly managed, but needed to be won. <br />I still feel with all the problems we have today we are better off by not electing John Kerry.<br />I wish our new President the best, but the fundamental difference between beings conservative / libertarian vs being liberal is too great. Not only in philosophy but also in tactics. For me process is as (or more) important than results. For many (not all) liberals, the ends justify the means. That should really scare freedom loving people. And it raises real alarms as we anoint a new President rather than appoint one. <br />A quick example of what I am talking about is the &quot;stimulus&quot; package. It is loaded down with crap that has nothing to do with actually stimulating the economy, but some people will feel justified in loading it up with partisan crap because they believe those projects are right. So they scream &quot;it&#039;s an emergency&quot; and then increase school spending which has nothing to do with any economic issues. It&#039;s not a good path to walk down.

The guy won and a lot of people are excited about it. They have every reason to be if they hated Bush that much. Many people don&#039;t agree that we&#039;re better off now than we would&#039;ve been if Kerry had won, and I know that a lot of people thought Obama didn&#039;t have a chance because of how the 2004 election turned out - hence the crazy excitement and people screaming in the streets when he won. Now that Obama actually is a few days into his presidency, reality will start to set in and people will be able to have fact-based responses to the way he leads.

Not all means are justified by the ends, of course. I think work should done ethically.

				I hear where you&#039;re coming from, Billz, but I think it would require some very profound changes in our culture. I don&#039;t believe that if Obama stood up today and said &quot;Hey, you guys, no more taxes. If you think a cause is really important, it&#039;s up to you to fund it&quot; everyone would sit down and write a check to their local public school. I think a whole new way of thinking about responsibility would have to take place. <br /><br />Public schools would become private schools, and only kids whose parents could afford to send them there would be able to go. I think it is likely that the private sector would do better at schools than govt, but what about the poor kids? Would there be a government program to provide assistance -- paid for by tax dollars? Would they go without education? <br /><br />My parents weren&#039;t at all rich. They probably would have still tried to send me to school if they&#039;d had to pay for it, but if I was getting the education they could afford, it would probably have been worse than the public school education I did get. I would be flipping burgers or waiting tables. My life is a million times better than that because thanks to government funding I did get to go to public school and then to a relatively cheap state university where I got Pell Grants - more government funding - and scholarships. <br /><br />I have a relative who has some mental issues. She is never going to be able to take full responsibility for herself. What should happen there? Should our family go broke paying for her living? Should she die alone in squalor? <br /><br />I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve thought about this - you&#039;re a bright guy - so how do you reconcile the ideal of total individual responsibility with these issues?

				Ah...&nbsp; &nbsp;:oops: &lt;--- it looks so sad. But I guess it&#039;s the best emoticon for the job. <br /><br />It&#039;s really interesting to hear a breakdown of conservative subgroups. I&#039;ve heard of social conservaties and libertarians, of course, but paleoconservative is a new term for me. Most of my personal experience is with my family of social conservatives who have a splash of libertarian distaste for taxes. <br /><br />I read an interesting book several years ago about the Christian right&#039;s move to gain power through the Republican party, I think it was by Bruce Bawers. Can&#039;t remember the name. Good book though. <br /><br />It&#039;s the social issues that make me a liberal. If it stopped being about gay rights, women&#039;s rights, etc., I&#039;d have to think hard about whether I was still a Democrat.

I am not being rude, but I am just too overloaded to provide the necessary links to bolster my statements. I will take a crack at the current questions though.<br />First - The federal government does not run schools. The Federal Department of Education could be (and should be) closed tomorrow and the country would be a better place. Yet another rule of conservatism is that the the government entity closest to the issue should handle it. Every dollar removed from the states and funneled through Washington to fund this bureaucracy is money wasted. I agree that education is a government function, just not a federal one.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">where I got Pell Grants - more government funding - and scholarships. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> First, every dollar that I pay in taxes to fund college education for someone else&#039;s child, that&#039;s 1 dollar that I can&#039;t pay to fund my own child&#039;s college. That is patently and completely not fair. Second, if the federal government stopped subsiding post secondary education at such a perverse rate, college tuition would drop, making college more affordable.<br /><br />And lastly, it would be cowardly of me not to address the big issue here:<br />First off, I am for same sex marriage if approved by the bodies that approve such initiatives. I oppose any judicial branch (or executive) coming down from on high with their edict. <br />But as a libertarian I am against government recognition, or benefits for any marriage. But I live in a society and I understand that the majority of people disagree with me. I suspect it is because they have the utilitarian belief that marriage and family is a net good for society. Certainly the numbers bare this out that two parents raising children in a stable environment is best for society. So I accept this, but now my conservative side kicks in and says that as long as it does the least to produce the greatest good, and is set up in a way that is the same for everyone I am OK. So the rules get written: must be of a certain age, not so close in family, one man one woman etc etc. And so it was for hundreds of years in this country. But societies will change, as all of them do, and age old ways of doing things get questioned. So when people are given a chance to say &quot;how about we change it two people instead of one man one woman&quot; most of them say &quot;nah&quot; let&#039;s keep it this way. But many also say &quot;yeah sure great idea&quot;. Now there are ways to handle these disputes. And I will predict that at some time in the not so distant future, the population will tilt to the side of &quot;yeah sure great idea&quot;. But it is a debate worth having, since it is definitely a societal change and society should have a chance to be heard. I know the argument &quot;civil rights are not something can be legislated&quot;. But then shouldn&#039;t we have the argument about wether the right to marry someone of the same gender is a civil right.<br /><br />Me personally, I would vote for same sex marriage, but it is more important to me that the process be followed. Hey maybe I did answer the old question

But to get bill over the 60 vote threshold in the senate, a kicker is added by the LA delegation that only ethnic French can make the new machines. Since no one could understand his Cajun accent, the bill actually stated that all ethnic French &quot;have to&quot; build soda machines.<br /><br />Well the rest of the story writes itself.&nbsp; But I see your point, the government must act quickly to undo all the damage that the government has done by acting quickly. <br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Having seen what people can do with the bible, I am rather leery of putting the constitution on a pedestal.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Having seen what the Bible (and Torah, and Koran) can do to people, I am rather leery of putting people on a pedestal. <br />

				Back to the &#039;Obama&#039; cult like following that Billz was referring to:<br /><br />The first black President <br />The first female President<br />The first openly gay President<br /><br />Any of the above would be so different to the previous 43 that naturally there would be all sort of memorabilia out there.&nbsp; I have nothing against all the coins, plates, mugs etc. because this is free enterprise after all, and can stimulate some sales, which is what capitalism is about, isn&#039;t it?<br /><br />I think that the euphoria is very understandable.&nbsp; We have a young, energetic, intelligent, question asking, thinking, curious, multi-racial, well traveled, gracious, willing to hear the other side black man for President after eight years of George Bush.&nbsp; For African Americans, this is a dream come true that they never thought would in their lifetimes.&nbsp; For those of us who were not fans of Bush, it feels like we are coming out of a dark tunnel and seeing some light.&nbsp; Will he dissapoint?&nbsp; Naturally.&nbsp; Will we always feel this euphoria?&nbsp; I doubt it.&nbsp; But truly, I will never, ever forget the night he won, or Inauguration Day.&nbsp; The election of Barack Obama was truly a once-in-a-lifetime event for me.&nbsp; In other words, in spite of what he does going forward, the election itself was a very unique experience for me.&nbsp; Who would have thought eight years ago that this man would be President today?&nbsp; Does anyone else feel this way?

				A lot of people feel the way you do Debbie. While after 8 years of Bush anybody would be a welcome change, the difference of the caliber of the 2 men are strikingly disproportionate. Obama has given so many people some hope that there is a voice of reason in the White House again, even with the seemingly unsurmontable problems he is facing. Hope isn&#039;t just a campaign slogan, it&#039;s making the changes that can make a difference for a better tomorrow.
