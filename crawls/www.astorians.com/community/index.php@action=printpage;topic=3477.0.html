				I&#39;ve lost count here... With the help of a dining companion yesterday, I made two Chinese dishes. One was only fair, with tofu, CSA bell peppers, and black bean sauce. The other was fantastic, and uses up CSA summer squash in an admirable way! Here&#39;s the recipe...<br /><br />Squash Pancakes (from From the Earth (http://www.ecookbooks.com/products.html?ref=286386562&amp;sid=84494720060906224721&amp;action=det_26819))<br /><br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>2 T roasted unsalted peanuts</li><li>1 1/2 c zucchini and summer squash, peeled, sliced into 1/2&quot; rounds, then julienned into 1/4&quot; sticks</li><li>1/2 scallion, trimmed, cut into 1/4&quot; rounds</li><li>1 egg, beaten</li><li>1/2 t sugar</li><li>1 T soy sauce</li><li>1/2 T Shao-Hsing wine or sherry</li><li>pinch of white pepper</li><li>a bit more than 1/4 c flour</li><li>3 T peanut oil</li></ul><br />1. Crush the peanuts coarsely between sheets of waxed paper.<br />2. Put the peanuts and all other ingredients aside from oil in a mixing bowl, and mix until batter is smooth and evenly distributed.<br />3. Heat a non-stick 10&quot; skillet over medium-high heat. Add oil and coat the pan. When quite hot, pour in the batter and spread into a layer, with the egg mixture evenly distributed. Cook for 2-3 minutes, until bottom is lightly browned, shaking the pan occasionally to prevent sticking.<br />4. Slide the pancake onto a large plate. Cover with another plate the same size. Flip the pancake over and slide back into the pan. Reduce the heat to medium and cook until squash is tender when pierced with a fork. <br /><br />Serves 4-6.<br />

				Harlan, this sounds great. My aunt used to make something like this. She also whipped up a &quot;dipping sauce&quot; to go with them, it was a sweet hoisin-like sauce that complimented the peanuts very well. Yay home-cooked Chinese: the best Chinese you&#39;ll get in Astoria...

				Whew. I had a free evening this evening, so I made a dent in my veggies. I chopped, blanched, and froze about 3/4 pound of carrots, made two quarts (!) of pickled beets and onions (http://www.moscowfood.coop/archive/pickling.html), and used up my eggplant by making baba ganouj. I still have left some basil, some lettuce, a ton of summer squash, and that fennel from a few weeks ago. And a giant stack of dishes...<br /><br />My grandma would be proud...&nbsp; :crazy:<br /><br />

				Admittedly, I do not cook as much of the food of my ancestors as I should... most of it comes down to recipes. I like to make things the way my grandma used to make them (who doesn&#39;t?) but a lot of those recipes just weren&#39;t transcribed. She passed away earlier this summer and I&#39;ve been thinking of having a Chinese food party to memorialize her enormous contribution to my personal culinary repetoire... but of course I&#39;ll have to practice some of those dishes first.<br /><br />Some of my favorites are dishes that can&#39;t be found on any restaurant menu (unless you&#39;re in a Shanghai place and bother the waiter in Mandarin, I find). I don&#39;t even know what the english monikers of many of these dishes would be:<br /><br />meatballs steamed and covered in sticky (pearl) rice<br />noodles with ground pork and tofu in a black bean/tomato sauce<br />long beans with pork belly<br />the Chinese charcuterie (including whole eggs boiled in beef broth, sliced)<br />pickled mustard greens (with wheat gluten blobs)<br />fried dough stick with shredded pork tucked into a sesame bing<br /><br />Lots to figure out and practice!

				Thanks for the volunteering!<br />I&#39;ve still got a lot of experimentation to do to see if I can get my grandma&#39;s dishes down.<br />There is a full moon autumn harvest festival coming up that&#39;s big with the Chinese. I was playing with the idea of having a food party around then-- featuring the red bean sweet &quot;moon cakes&quot; too!

				I took Chinese cooking classes for about 3 years a while back when I lived in NJ.&nbsp; Sharon Quan was a wonderful little woman who also owned a med-sized Chinese grocery store in Wyckoff (Bergen County).&nbsp; I actually have a great recipe for those meatballs covered in rice if you&#39;d like.&nbsp; They&#39;re so delish.&nbsp; I haven&#39;t made them in ages, but the recipe is right on the money.

That would be great! I&#39;m in the dark here, the only guiding force is my gustatory memory of how my grandma&#39;s used to taste... and that&#39;s a tough way to start on a dish. A recipe would help!<br />Thanks!

				Hi! I took Sharon Quan&#039;s class at Ramsey high school many years ago. Her store in Waldwick is closed now. I had a book of recipes from her class and it get lost in the move. I used to do Travelling Wok but now I&#039;m beside myself. The class I took had beef, chicken and shrimp, cocktail size eggroll, fried rice and a few other recipes. Is there any way I can get copies from you so I can start Wok-ing again?<br /><br /><br />Good to know someone else who knew Sharon.<br /><br /><br />William
