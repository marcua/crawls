				<br />Today as I sat in Sixty Beans looking out the window, I seemed to notice three adjoining buildings (that formerly housed Shade Bar, some nail salon, and I think a pawn shop) as all appearing to be completely empty.<br /><br />That seems too much of a coincidence.&nbsp; I wonder if the same person owns all three buildings and somehow got all the tenants out...maybe jacked up the rent to impossibly high amounts?<br /><br />I wonder what&#039;s up?<br /><br />It&#039;s really sad that some people see nothing but dollar signs and that there is no broad oversight or consideration for what we want the neighborhood to look and feel like.&nbsp; Everyone is just out to capitalize on the new $$ population moving in and make money.

				Shade Bar has been closed for a couple of months, but it seemed like they literally shut down overnight when they did. It was sudden.

				<br />Re: Shade Bar, I went there once for a cut and...I really did not like the owner at all.&nbsp; Something about him really rubbed me the wrong way.&nbsp; The stylist however (who moved on to Space at the other half of Ditmars well before Shade shut down) is awesome and I still continue to see him at Space.&nbsp; ;-)
