				Anyone following the Lieberman/Lamont race up in Connecticut?&nbsp; The primary is today and the polls show a tight race.&nbsp; Lamont has taken Lieberman to task on his support for the war and his close relationship with President Bush.&nbsp; Lieberman has tried to paint Lamont as a one-issue candidate and an out-of-touch millionaire.

				Lamont may or may not be an out-of-touch millionaire but he is a one-issue candidate.&nbsp; I admire Lieberman for preceisely the reason that Lamont voters detest him: he&#39;s independent and doesn&#39;t always adhere to the hyper-partisan party line.<br /><br />I hope Lieberman loses the primary, I hope he runs as an independent and I hope (as the polls are predicting) he wins the general election in a landslide.&nbsp; I would love to see centrist politicians break from both parties and start a new, centrist party.&nbsp; I think it would be like the Republican party in 1856.

				Via Daily Kos - I found this blog which I thought was very interesting.&nbsp; I&#39;ve never been a big Lieberman fan.&nbsp; My mom, a rapid Republican who lives in Georgia adores Joe Lieberman, though she thinks he may be too liberal on most issues.&nbsp; Ever since he went after Clinton on Monica Lewinsky, I&#39;ve not been a fan (plus he took out Lowell Weicker, who I still think is one of the greatest public servants in recent history).&nbsp; I&#39;m not sure that a Lamont win will either help or hurt Democrats, nor will a Lieberman win destroy the anti-war faction within the Democratic party, but I do agree that Lieberman attacks Democrats a lot more than he ever attacks Republicans.<br /><br />I found this blog very interesting:<br /><br />http://glenngreenwald.blogspot.com/2006/08/why-do-neoconservative-extremists-love.html<br /><br />and this video on youtube as well:<br /><br />http://youtube.com/watch?v=1I2Qqxuls4U<br /><br />Ann Coulter backing his re-election aggressively and his intervention in the Terri Schiavo case have only soured me more on Senator Lieberman.<br />

				As much as I want to be excited for the Jewish community and political achievements because Joe Lieberman was the VP candidate alongside Kerry, <br />it&#39;s precisely because Joe Lieberman puts his interpretation of the Jewish faith into his politics that he drives me crazy. From his support for the Iraq War (because that&#39;s supporting Israel) to his position on the Terry Schiavo case (it opposes orthodox principles of sanctity of life), he is as guilty as Bush for letting his religious principles drive his politics.<br />that&#39;s my take and i&#39;d be curious to hear how other people interpret it.

				Lieberman just conceded to Lamont, but intends to run as an independent in the general election, possibly costing the Democrats the three contested House seats in CT.&nbsp; It should be interesting to see if he gets any traction.&nbsp; Maybe he heard the message that being so close to Bush, and so critical of other Democrats, was not what people wanted, but I doubt it.

				Politically, I detest Joe Lieberman. He is a statist with a particular passion for social conservatism.&nbsp; He also continues to insist everything is going just fine in Iraq. Lieberman seems to take a bipartisan approch to public policy: Whichever of the two parties is advocating the absolute worst position, that&#39;s the position he&#39;ll take. <br /><br />Plus, if he runs as an independent, he basically guarentees the Republicans will win the seat. He has to know he doesn&#39;t have much of a chance and there&#39;s a move to get him out of office. At some point you just need to shut up and accept that The People don&#39;t like you.

				Well, some people like him.&nbsp; He got 48% of the vote, and that&#39;s pretty high.&nbsp; Almost just as high as Kerry against Bush.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />For the record, I don&#39;t like him either.&nbsp; Nor Hillary at this point.

				I would be highly surprised if Lamont won the general election in November. I can see Lieberman splitting the Democratic vote, or I can see him winning. If everyone who voted for him in the primary votes the same way in the general election, he&#39;d only need to pick up some independent and/or Republican voters to win, and he has some support there.

				Lamont came from far down in the polls as an unknown, riding Democratic (and some independent) voter anger at Lieberman.&nbsp; I think now that he&#39;s the Democratic nominee, he well may be able to beat Lieberman in a three way race (especially given the Republican candidate being very disorganized and being attacked from within his own party over gambling issues).&nbsp; Lieberman might well cost Democrats picking up the three contested House seats (his campaign manager refused to say if he would be supporting the Democratic challengers or the Republican incumbents), but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a foregone conclusion that he&#39;s going to coast to re-election.&nbsp; Keep in mind what happened in NY in 1986 when incumbent Republican US Senator Javitz lost his primary to Alfonse D&#39;Amato.&nbsp; He kept running on the Liberal line and got creamed.&nbsp; I think it will take a few days to see what the new dynamic will be in Connecticut, but I think this race, coupled with the defeats of a number of other incumbents shows that voters are angry and taking it out on people currently in office.

				mcdirk that&#39;s pretty much exactly what i think, but the only thing i might add is that when the national republican party smells blood, they get a lot more aggressive.&nbsp; since this election might be the only opportunity for them to pick up a senate seat in conn., they might pour a lot of national funds and resources into this election.

				The National Republicans definitely could get more involved, especially if things tighten in Tennessee, Virginia or Arizona (Democrats are looking strong in five seats now, and look likely to hold all of their current seats - though Maryland and Washington could still be problematic).&nbsp; I think it&#39;s more likely the Republicans try to co-opt Lieberman than really advance their current nominee.&nbsp; He&#39;s been polling about 18% and I understand he has quite a few problems (he&#39;s also to Lieberman&#39;s left on most issues).

				Republican US Senate candidates in tight races against Democrats in Washington State and Minnesota have endorsed Lieberman and rumors are that Karl Rove called him to offer support (though Lieberman denies this - though his staff, who were fired, confirmed it).&nbsp; It&#39;s going to be an interesting race this Fall.&nbsp; The new Rasmussen poll has Lieberman up by three, within the margin of error, but Lamont is strong as well.&nbsp; Schlessinger looks like he&#39;s going nowhere.
