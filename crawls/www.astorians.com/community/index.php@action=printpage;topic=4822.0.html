				I had a roommate who did it. &nbsp;She seemed to like it, but it is very hard. &nbsp;More than likely, you end up in a bad school in the Bronx or Brooklyn, with kids that need alot of help. &nbsp;It&#39;s pretty stressful but if you can handle the drama of an inner-city school, it can be very rewarding. &nbsp;She told me though, that the city&#39;s no longer paying for your master&#39;s, it&#39;s more of a loan now. &nbsp;So it&#39;s not as great a program as it used to be, plus on top of your studies for your masters, you have all the demands of a full-day class.

				What I mean is that when they&#39;re recruiting for the program they give the applicants a really rosy account of what it&#39;s going to be like, but the teaching fellow wind up with the classes that are the toughest that none of the experienced teachers want, and absolutely zero support to deal with it.&nbsp; I believe somewhere between a third and a half end up quitting--evidence of a poorly-designed program, imo.

				OT? I wanted to respond to the teaching fellows questions and since there is no new topic yet....<br /><br />Basically, the Teaching Fellows program provides an opportunity to become a teacher with no formal training. You are assigned to a classroom (yes usually in a less than optimal area) and as you begin teaching, you begin your master&#39;s coursework. You do not need to have an education background in order to join this program,<br /><br />Why the bait and switch criticism? Once you enroll int he program, you are told that you have additional education classes to take. While you thought you didn&#39;t need to have an education background, afterwards you have several pre-requisite classes you need to take in order to complete the program. This frustrates a lot of peole. <br /><br />I have heard positive and negative things, most vearing toward the negative, but I think that isn&#39;t so much because it is a negative program, but rather the expectations are not clearly laid out. It is made out to be easier than it is, probably to recruit. I don&#39;t think it should be easy, but I think that the program should be more honest in how it presents itself.<br /><br />BTW I&#39;m a teacher and professor

				Back to the original question....<br /><br />I wonder... are there really no other public school teachers here? <br />or are they just too darn busy to post.&nbsp; <br /><br />I was able to breathe today around 4:30pm... just in time to finish writing my midterm (to be given tomorrow&nbsp; - funny thing though - I&#39;m on the schedule to proctor the Math B regents exam during the same time i&#39;m supposed to be giving my own midterm) and then&nbsp; I found out there were no working copy machines in the building.&nbsp; I printed out a class set off a printer in the business office (my own printer has been out of commission for 2 months now) - which I&#39;ll give out to students who must swear on their lives that they will not write on them, because they will have to be used by all my other classes.&nbsp; <br /><br />Finished writing part one of the midterm - able to get out of the building by 5:30 = only left that early b/c I had a 6pm doctors appt. Gotta love a doc who is willing to schedule a 6pm.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />my guess is that there are teachers out there... just a little busy. <br /><br /><br />funny - i know that there are 20 people out there going... sarcasticallly&nbsp; &#39;poor thing had to work til 5:30!!&#39;&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />which is of course - why teachers would want to seek one another out - b/c until you have put in a full day in front of a classroom full of teens .... you have no idea about the energy level that it requires....&nbsp; <br /><br />i think i&#39;m having a conversation with myself here....<br /><br />oh and about the Fellows program:&nbsp; I really don&#39;t know that much about it&nbsp; - but... having worked in 3 different school districts and having had experience being the newbie 3 times I have to say - I have never been so impressed by the caliber of new teachers as I was going through orientation here in NYC with a group of Fellows.&nbsp; I don&#39;t know if any lasted or where they were placed... but dang!!! The city managed to recruit some awesomely fantastic people for the job.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				Oh Jennifer, I totally agree with you about working until 5:30/6:00 and being completely exhausted.<br /><br />Is there something wrong with copiers all over the place?&nbsp; We have two copiers in our building, one for the Middle School, and one for the Elementary school, and they were both down.&nbsp; I ended up changing my lesson plan on the spot because I couldn&#39;t copy some papers for the kids.&nbsp; It is so frustrating when you have to break the routine the kids are used to.<br /><br />I stayed late today to grade many papers, work on student portfolios, and also other miscellaneous paperwork for Promotion-in-Doubt letters.&nbsp; On top of this, the No Child Left Behind test in math is coming up, only 27 more school days to prep the kids for them.&nbsp; I am working with a small group of students every day till about 4:45 just to help them feel more comfortable with the test, and to hopefully improve their scores.<br /><br />So I wonder if it may be the same thing about teachers being completely busy and not having time to post.<br /><br />Okay, off I go... to create a couple worksheets for tomorrow&#39;s classes.&nbsp; Hmm... it never ends!

				Speaking of teachers being completely busy.&nbsp; I definitely think there is a correlation with CLASS SIZE as well.&nbsp; I currently have a class with 32 students.&nbsp; There are others in my school with 33 and 34.&nbsp; And to think, some high schools have 35 per class.&nbsp; I really think it is rough with this many students.&nbsp; It just doesn&#39;t work.<br /><br />Check this article out:&nbsp; http://www.uft.org/news/teacher/top/bestshot_lower_classsize/

				I can&#39;t believe the union max is 34...I taught on long island and the max there was somewhere around 22, but that may have changed.

				when i did my student teaching in Seattle - one of my classes had 40 kids in it. The union limit was 32 or 35 - I don&#39;t remember which.&nbsp; But the 40 was okay with the teacher, so it was done.&nbsp; The kids were so packed in the room that once they were in their seats no one was allowed to move.&nbsp; The teacher never left the front of the room.&nbsp; It was a pretty high level gifted/talented (I mean 1/2 the kids actually WERE gifted) 8th grade math class.&nbsp; <br /><br />This year I have a sweet schedule with three very small 9th grade math classes.&nbsp; Enrollment numbers are from 13 - 24.&nbsp; It&#39;s a fluke in the schedule b/c we stopped teaching an accelerated course and so this year I only teach 2/3 of the 9th graders (I taught the other 1/3 last year when they were accelerated).&nbsp; To make up for the LOW numbers in my classes- the administration came up with the brilliant proposal that I also teach a math workshop class - 6 sections of 12 - 14 students.&nbsp; Add to the math classes my advisory and the grand total of the students I see in week is about 150.&nbsp; <br />

				Changing the topic slightly...I&#39;d love to know whether the middle school teachers ever get requests like an email I just received in which a student asked that I place my *entire* PowerPoint presentations (I&#39;m teaching an introductory art history lecture course) on the course website *before* the lectures so that she can print them out and take notes.&nbsp; Huh?<br /><br />Of course, there is also the student who complained that there was too much reading (less than 50 pages a week, folks) and that since he might forget it all before the exams, wouldn&#39;t the lectures be enough info?<br /><br />*sigh*

				I am a teacher!&nbsp; Well, now a principal in a charter school, but still choose to teach one class a day because it is my passion.&nbsp; I came into teaching through Teach For America in 1998 and have taught for seven years in the South Bronx and Harlem- 4th grade, 5th grade, and a bit of 8th grade ELA.&nbsp; Now I&#39;m teaching Social Studies to my 6th graders.<br /><br />I also worked for the New York City Teaching Fellows since it started.&nbsp; If anyone is interested in applying, I&#39;d be happy to discuss the pros/cons.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#39;s a great program only if you are completely aware of what you are getting into. I can also debate the pros/cons of Teach For America as well. <br /><br />I would love to get to together with other teachers or educators.<br /><br />I would love to meet up with other teachers to talk.&nbsp;

				Welcome to the board and the conversation Katlu.&nbsp; Where are you a principal? How is it going?&nbsp; Is it an any more &quot;doable&quot; job than being principal in a regular public school?&nbsp; <br /><br />The bureaucracy of our system is mind numbing

				Thanks, aqua and Alexa.&nbsp; FYI, this is a college level lecture course.&nbsp; I completely agree with giving students the resources that they need - I&#39;ve already told the students, on the syllabus and in class, that selected images will be placed on the course website for them to study well in advance of the exams - not all of the images (which will be almost 1000), but the most important ones that they&#39;ll definitely be responsible for identifying and dating on the exams (this is standard practice for art history classes).&nbsp; I also give them handouts in every lecture with important dates, names, terms.&nbsp; What surprises me is that unlike (I assume) middle school students, college students have the freedom to choose which classes to enroll in.&nbsp; So even if they are taking my class to fulfill, say a humanities requirement, if they saw the syllabus and didn&#39;t agree with the requirements and policies, they could elect to take a different class rather than ask me to change my expectations or policies.&nbsp;

				I give students my lectures...some request the lectures for the entire semester, but I&#39;m just not that ahead of my game, and I also find that while most ask for them, they don&#39;t do much with them if provided early on. <br /><br />Some students are demanding and expect a lot. Usually I hand out my lectures in class. I have found it makes for better discussion when they have a reference point and are not spending a lot of time copying notes. It also focuses them on what topics are more important. Very few professors I work with do this, as they feel it is the students responsibility to get the notes, but I feel this view is archaic..<br /><br />Good luck with the course McW...Personally, i really dig teaching at the graduate level..

				I teach too!&nbsp; I&#39;m a professor, and I enjoy eavesdropping on my HS teacher friends for time-saving tips and classroom management strategies.&nbsp; First, they are busier than I am.&nbsp; Second, they more likely&nbsp; have a pedagogical background, unlike me.&nbsp; So thanks, everyone, for this interesting dicussion...we are in the best line of work, ever.<br /><br />Re. the Requested Class Notes controversy:&nbsp; My take is that they pay to come to lectures, and it is up to them to be there, or not.&nbsp; I have a lot of frosh students, and I see my job to train them in attending lecture, IF they want good grades.&nbsp; In lecture I will do almost anything to entertain, re-phrase, get input, and explain things 6 different ways, with drama, wit, whatever.&nbsp; But lecture only happens once, they are making sacrifices to be in college, and it is up to them to start deciding how to respond to opportunities.&nbsp; I won&#39;t email class notes, and I won&#39;t boil down a 90-minute lecture into a 30 second answer to &quot;Hey, professor, did I miss anything in class on Tuesday?&quot;&nbsp; I tell students to get notes from another student, and then bring them to me o go over with them in person.&nbsp; Nobody ever takes me up on this offer.&nbsp; In fact, I think they rarely bother to get the notes from other students.&nbsp; I also believe that text-versions of a 90-minute lecture will not do them any good, and might actually mislead them on certain point.&nbsp; I think my take on this is harsh, but reasonable (given 4 classes with an average of 160+ students a semester).&nbsp; <br /><br />So...is it <em>too </em> harsh?&nbsp; Any input.....?

				I think the harshness depends on how your students respond...if I find they are being incredibly demanding, I get turned off. I keep requirements on number of lectures you can miss but I also teach graduate students who are all currently teaching, and don&#39;t want to treat them like children. They are busy adults that are working very hard, so I try to fit the class to meet their needs...I also don&#39;t blindly email my lectures. I pdf them, and then I send them to those that request it, that WERE in class. Those who weren&#39;t need to get the notes from a peer. <br /><br />I might have a different take on this if I taught undergrads.

				Ah......so they only get the notes if they WERE in class.&nbsp; Gotcha.&nbsp; Yeah, the treating like children/like adults is a hard decision when their operative age seems to range about 10 years from day to day.&nbsp; Even the same group!&nbsp; The only notes I have that are in any shape to distribute are just the scant outlines put into PowerPoint.&nbsp; I use it because my university likes it.&nbsp; And it gives me something big to point at, with dramatic emphasis.&nbsp; The outlines are barely helpful; there is no content, no detail written in there, and it scares me how grateful students are to get them as handouts.&nbsp; They are good for organizing, but not a substitute for hearing the lecture.&nbsp; This is something my undergrads rarely understand.&nbsp; Security blanket kind of thing, maybe?

				I use the powerpoints as well, and leave blanks...so really, they aren&#39;t going to help them in the class unless they are their to hear the &quot;meat&quot; of the lecture...i&#39;m not into handing out materials to prevent attendance, rather to enhance participation. So far so good, but I am fairly new to this (second year). I&#39;m always looking for better ways to increase participation and interest in the material. <br /><br />But I do think that undergrads and grads are different. I see graduate students as my peers and try to treat them as such, the same way I would like to be treated if I were in the course.

				I have found that powerpoints are actually helpful for students to take better notes. As much as high school students are pushed to take notes, they don&#39;t get to college and graduate school knowing the ropes and very few people teach note-taking. Handing out the lecture word for word is inappropriate, but handing out the notes is only fair. If I am going to show a powerpoint on a projector, I would rather encourage meaningful discussion than have my class furiously note-taking...It might decrease some note-taking, but the proof is in the pudding when they do well on tests and assignments.

				I may be overestimating y&#39;all&#39;s students, but if it were me, it might be helpful to take notes on the actual printout of the powerpoint/slide.&nbsp; I have a very visual memory, so if, when I was studying, I was looking at the same thing I&#39;d been looking at when the professor was talking, it would make it easier for me to remember whatever was being talked about, *especially* if, as in mcw&#39;s case what I needed to remember was about an image.<br />That may be what they have in mind when they ask for powerpoints.

				Mcw, I totally agree, and would be extremely careful with more demanding students. The age doesn&#39;t seem to matter. I usually have to begin my courses each semester with a mild reminder that all of the work in the course is &quot;their&quot; responsibility and quickly you can pick out the ones that will try to milk kindness, especially that of perhaps a younger professor (myself) for all they can. <br /><br />Ideally, I think whatever works for the professor and the class to lead a fluid class is fine and should be individually determined. There are pros and cons to each side. But it is nice to hear feedback from other instructors...sorry to teachers if we hi-jacked this site a bit.

				&quot;Educator&#39;s happy hour&quot;.....may I suggest that fine day in June, some kind of Tuesday, probably, when you just realize that you are *truly* done with the semester, and have recovered enough from the trauma of finals to start to remember your self, and then it hits you! that everyone else in the world has to get up and shower and put on a decent mood and go in to The Place where autonomy is expressed solely through expressive coffee cups, and have a full 8-hour work day, whereas you: You don&#39;t even have to SHOWER if you don&#39;t want.&nbsp; Because the school year is OVER.<br /><br />(Happy hour?&nbsp; Get it?&nbsp; HAPPY hour?)<br /><br />At least it beats that *other* kind of summer day, usually about a week later, when you hit the local bookstores/coffee shops/home depots/stapleses to fill out applications because you can&#39;t live in a teaching salary.&nbsp; That&#39;s less Happy.&nbsp; Particularly when you realize you&#39;ll be spending the summer working in a hyper-air-conditioned place instead of writing The Book that you know would get you tenure and/or a better teaching job, but then you know you can&#39;t work on that The Book right now because you can&#39;t.&nbsp; Afford.&nbsp; Paper.<br /><br />But then, maybe that&#39;s just more me.&nbsp; Hm.

				mathforum.org<br />nctm.org<br /><br />are two of the best for materials on line. <br /><br />I highly recommend Connected Math Project for middle school - especially if you can afford to give 90+ minutes a day to math. It&#39;s an awesome program -&nbsp; but probably needs to be supplemented with skills crap b/c of our ridiculous focus on testing testing testing.... though... it&#39;s supposed to do great things for kids with regard to testing - after they&#39;ve been using it for a few years.&nbsp; It&#39;s really a follow up to the older elementary Terk curriculum.&nbsp; <br /><br />Katlu - what grades are at your school.&nbsp; And what are you currently doing about math??<br /><br />

				Thanks Jennifer-<br /><br />I&#39;m at a charter school and we create our own curriculum for just about everything. we don&#39;t use any textbooks, just lots of resources to pull from.

				How&#039;s this for a good story - I&#039;m giving the midterm for my class tomorrow, and I received an email from a student saying that a fire had broken out today in her room at school, and that the fire department came and said no one could move back in until tomorrow and could she schedule a make-up exam.&nbsp; I was really suspicious, because she had asked once before whether I could move the midterm to another day.&nbsp; I spent a good amount of time sleuthing, talked to the fire department, and verified that they had not been sent out to her sorority house all year.&nbsp; Bah!&nbsp; &nbsp;:x&nbsp;

				MCW--nice one!&nbsp; I love a good, well-researched bust.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am considering sending condolence cards to every student who claims a death in a family to get a deadline or test moved.&nbsp; There are just too many such claims.&nbsp; They are not all true claims.&nbsp; Statistically, they cannot possibly be all true.&nbsp; If they were all true, there would not be a single living grandparent in all of Queens or Long Island.&nbsp; &nbsp;:x&nbsp; Students who play THAT card really get me mad.&nbsp; Who would dare to feign a dead grandparent just to get out of taking a test when scheduled???&nbsp; What kind of audacious, insensitive game is that to play?&nbsp; (I actually lost a grandmother when I was an undergraduate, so perhaps a bit of mis-placed anger operates here.)&nbsp; The average number of &quot;deaths in the family&quot; experienced by a class of, say, 50, for every given test has been in my experience as high as 6.&nbsp; For one test.&nbsp; Am I nuts?&nbsp; Does that not seem high?<br /><br />How are they going to feel when there actually IS a death in the family??&nbsp; After they&#039;ve already sort of invoked one, for such a petty purpose???&nbsp; Grrrrrrrrr.<br /><br />Anyway.&nbsp; I also love the students who need a test delayed due to the unfortunate fact that their plane tickets to the beach conflict with the test.&nbsp; Also, this year, I had one let me know that s/he was taking spring break the week after the rest of the university.&nbsp; (This one also let me know that missing a week of classes wasn&#039;t a big deal, because &quot;I took this subject in high school, and I already know it all already.&quot;)<br /><br />Which brings us to a neat safety tip: If you want to do well in a class, don&#039;t tell the professor that you &quot;already know&quot; the whole subject already.&nbsp; Ohhhhhh, my.

				I totally agree, Tumnus - one of my relatives was injured in a house fire, so I know how scary and destructive an event like that really is&nbsp; Anyway, the student showed up, but then another student bailed - it was so weird, he came to class, and left before I passed out the exams.&nbsp; I thought he was just leaving to use the restroom, but he never came back.&nbsp; And then another student asked me when they would get the midterms back, saying that she didn&#039;t think she had done well (she&#039;s actually a B/B+ student), and needed to know before the last day to withdraw from the class.&nbsp; *sigh*&nbsp; But my spring break has just begun.&nbsp; Woo hoo!

				Seeing as it is my vacation week, I am of course obsessing about work.&nbsp; Cannot.&nbsp; Pry.&nbsp; &nbsp;Brain.&nbsp; Away.<br /><br />I have a question: When it comes to teaching at high school and at college levels, there is this hot issue of Retention, i.e., &quot;How To Make Them Graduate, Even When Dropping Out Is So Much Easier.&quot;&nbsp; I believe that there are different levels of expectation for where our responsibility, as teachers, is in preventing dropping out.&nbsp; It seems that high school teachers have to take students more in hand and maybe almost shove them through the work, even monitoring in some cases that students are doing their basic responsibilities to learn enough to pass, or to learn that study skills DOES make a different.&nbsp; In college, I think a teacher&#039;s job is less to MAKE students pass, and more to hold out as an offer what they need to do, with suggestions as to how they do it, in order to learn what is needed for any given course.&nbsp; I think this, but I probably have a professor&#039;s bias.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to hear more between these 2 groups about this question, and I have noticed that there are representatives from both kinds of teachers in this thread.&nbsp; This could get contentious, but that is not always a bad thing.&nbsp; I wanna hear differing opinions.<br /><br />So...where is the line between doing too much to Retain a student, and doing not enough?&nbsp; I have been struggling with the question of how aggressive I ought to be in pushing students to get enough done to pass a course, rather than dropping it or failing.&nbsp; I can identify students in trouble easily, but how much do I push/remind/email these students to do what they need?&nbsp; If a student never takes any notes in lecture, then struggles to get through tests, do I point out to him that he might try <em>writing down </em> what I say in lecture?&nbsp; If a student&#039;s priorities are clearly ranked such that schoolwork falls so low that she is unlikely to get by, do I tell her that?&nbsp; Do I try to scare a student with failing if he does not reorganize priorities?&nbsp; Or do I merely let her know, without the scare-tactics, that she is not going to make it if she skips another lecture, or fails another quiz, and then let the proof of that big fat F shock her into deciding to re-organize priorities?&nbsp; Maybe this is an issue best settled by an individual teacher&#039;s personality and pedagogical outlook, but....well, I&#039;m looking for more viewpoints.<br /><br />So, thoughts?&nbsp; Or stories to illustrate successes/failures in this regard?

				going to be a TA this fall for the first time for a course in a study abroad program at a uni in japan...nervous as hell, especially since its not a TA in the sense of traditional TA like grade papers...and the course is totally new too. <br /><br />this may be a bit off topic...but i noticed on the thread that there are quite a few people who do the teacher (k-12)/professor (uni/college) thing...i myself am applying to grad school this fall for fall 2008 - particularly for a phd in history (japanese) - and was also interested in teaching k-12 (or rather 7-12 world history) as an option other than trying to nail a professor job.<br /><br />so, i may sound naive and all but i was curious as to how you guys (as phd&#039;s) also were able to get a job in the k-12 system (either public or private). my mom is a para in the public system (grade 4) so she has told me about the state licensing tests, which i will take more later than sooner (still in japan) - i may be jumping the gun, but i have been thinking about this for awhile and figured i could store any information/advice/anecdotes into my brain until the time comes for me to use it. <br /><br />thanks in advance!

				Things are going well for me this year as well.&nbsp; I have already taken my advisory class to Central Park for a picnic.&nbsp; This group seems to respect me (so far) more than their teachers last year.&nbsp; It could be partly due to our new &quot;high school&quot; block schedule.&nbsp; My seventh graders are very intimidated by that.<br /><br />For me:&nbsp; New Schedule.&nbsp; New Room.&nbsp; New Course (Computer Tech 7).&nbsp; NO SCIENCE, MATH ONLY!

				I teach in Astoria and work with the alternate assessment population, most of whom have paras.&nbsp; Many of the paras I have work with are excellent and love to be involved in the classroom.&nbsp; If they are willing or able, include them in your lessons by assigning them tasks like handing out worksheets or working with a particular group.&nbsp; You can also encourage them to ask questions in class, as many students are often to afraid to.&nbsp; While the majority of paras are wonderful, don&#039;t hesitate to remind those who are not fulfilling their obligations what is expected of them.&nbsp; I had paras that read the newspaper in class (and of course<em> I</em> got in trouble in the observation) and I&#039;ve heard of many other problems like those who leave their kids in the classroom when they are supposed to be with them at all times, and those who are inappropriate and make loud, rude and vulgar comments about students in front of other students (such as, &quot;she smells like peepee&quot;).&nbsp; &nbsp;Incidents like this should always be reported to your A.P. (C.Y.A., you know?) So, observe how they act in the classroom and if they seem like they would be open to becoming involved in the lessons approach them about what they might like to do.&nbsp;

				Of all the teachers that are here - does anyone specifically teach at an Astoria public school? and although I know this si irritating but does anyone have tips as to how I should approach the school system - teachers, students and para professionals so as to interview them?<br /><br />I just had a fairly basic interview with one para professional how by the end said she just didnt want her interview to be used anymore.<br /><br />Questions that I am seeing to be answered are basically<br /><br />1. How many para professionals are there in the Queens school district - system?<br />2. How do they help out? students? teachers?<br />3. Do they actually help out, students? teachers?<br />4. Is a teaching degree/ experience necessary for them to be effective, because the ones that I am interviewing are recent immigrants with no experience whatsoever in special education or education at all, and just find this to be an easy enough job<br /><br />Could anyone let me know if these questions are offensive or rude, as a another major handicap on my end is that I have not grown up in the US and therefore am unfamiliar with how public education institutions operate.<br /><br />At my wits end, any help would be much appreciated! sorry for going on this tangent from previous discussions of lesson plans and coordinating social events.

				My wife and I are teachers.&nbsp; We both taught in the public school system in Harlem for a total of 10 years.&nbsp; My wife now teaches at a very successful charter school, and I left the system to stay home and take care of my son.<br /><br />I was the union rep for my building last year, and all I have to say to <span class="bbc_u">any<span class="bbc_u"> teacher is-BE CAREFUL in regards to the new &#039;restructuring&#039; of your school.<br /><br />Anyhow, let me tell you how happy I am to have &#039;retired&#039;.&nbsp; Teaching your own child after you have been teaching everyone else&#039;s is such a relief.&nbsp; <br /><br />Plus, I have to say, getting away from so many people who feel that you are not there as a teacher to their child, but a free day-care is the best thing about not being in the NYCDOE any longer.<br /><br />Let me know what you think..</span></span>

				Hi everyone... <br /><br />I am a teacher in Woodside (that is the street address...although the garbage cans say astoria!) and also live in Astoria. I teach a 6:1:1 class with a 1:1 para as well as I have lots of experience working with paras... most of them positive. I am also a teaching fellow and have had a lot of positive experiences with that as well (there were some pretty interesting remarks about the program in earlier pages). I understand the frustration that other people have with the program but for myself I have been very lucky in both school selection and overall teaching experiences. <br /><br />

				I am a special ed teacher... there are ratios to describe the type of class you are teaching. The first number is the number of students, the second number the number of teachers, and when applicable the third number is the number of paraprofessionals. There are 12:1, 12:1:4, 8:1:1, and 6:1:1. I teach 6 students with autism in a classroom with one teacher and one paraprofessional but I also have a one-to-one para in my room which means that we have two paras and one teacher for 6 students.&nbsp; The other ratios generally describe different types of disabilities: for example 12:1:4 is usually multiple disabilities, 8:1:1 i think is ED (emotional disability/disturbed), 12:1 or 12:1:1 LD (learning disabled) or a mixed bunch and 6:1:1 as far as I know is almost always children with autism. <br /><br />hope that helps clear it up :)
