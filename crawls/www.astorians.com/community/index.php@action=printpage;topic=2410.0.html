				Hi all! If this topic hasn&#39;t been addressed yet on the Board then I think that now<br />may be a good time to explore it in detail, being such a fundamental yet highly<br />undervalued &amp; misunderstood right.<br /><br />I found this in Wikipedia, and it seems as good a definition as any:<br />I quote: &quot;Privacy is the ability of an individual or group to keep their lives and personal affairs out of public view, or to control the flow of information about themselves. Privacy is sometimes related to anonymity although it is often most highly valued by people who are publicly known. Privacy can be seen as an aspect of securityâ€”one in which trade-offs between the interests of one group and another can become particularly clear.&quot; (&quot;Privacy&quot;)<br /><br />I look foward to heated debate by both proponents <em>and</em> opponents of personal privacy, why exactly it is important or perhaps a threat in the days post 9/11. As a suggestion, maybe we can even analyze the Wikipedia article point by point, as it summarizes the debate quite nicely although any other sources or input (especially personal stories and real life daily examples) are appreciated.<br /><br />Any thoughts? :)<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />&quot;Privacy.&quot; Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia. 20 Jun 2006, 22:17 UTC.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. 21 Jun 2006<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Privacy&amp;oldid=59702372&gt;.<br />

				Thanks Zeno for the topic. You probably deserve more thoughtful responses than what I might write now. (Might want to revisit responses after the 4th of July.)<br />And glad for Jcy&#39;s point of question.<br /><br /><br />I would be interested in the question of privacy and security. (Does the govt. surrender your privacy in the claim of offering security? ... )<br />My preference would be that individuals could control the flow of personal information.<br />But there are a lot of tradeoffs with increased technology and business, not to mention govt. intrusion.<br /><br />I think my younger hopes for privacy were quaint and find I accept more and more an openness to general disclosure. Still I often try to maintain more privacy where possible (less and less is possible or desirable to me).<br /><br />As to our privacy rights, you are right in that I may misunderstand it very much.<br />I believe much of legal rights to privacy would be considered under:<br /><br /><br />Amendment IX<br />The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. <br /><br /><br />

				anyway, the point i was trying to get at is that phone records aren&#39;t necessarily your property or subject to any special protection.&nbsp; can you imagine calling up verizon and asking them to delete all your call records and logs, as per your rights as a property owner.<br /><br />now actually listening in on phone conversations is something completely different.&nbsp; the phone company nor the government cannot lay claim to any sort of ownership or special privilege to your correspondence or the content of your communications w/o a warrant from a court.&nbsp; that is explicitly covered by the 4th constitutional amendment which is the &quot;right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures&quot;

				Privacy is extremely important.&nbsp; I think if the telephone had been around at the time of the creation of the constitution a reference to it and other electronic communication would have been included.<br /><br />No one is guaranteed absolute privacy, but the Constitution as I interpret it, is meant to give us a level of privacy as long as we don&#39;t do anything that would merit our loss of it.&nbsp; The whole foundation of this goverment was that a group of people who lived far away from the power center of their government felt restrictions and limitations were being placed on them by said government and they had no self-determination.<br /><br />When crafting the government, restrictions were put in place because they saw the effects of power consolidated too much with an individual.&nbsp; (This is ironic since the British monarchy was one of the most severely weaked monarchies after the drafting of the Magna Carta).<br /><br />I feel we should all strive for as much privacy as we want and should support others in their quest for privacy especially in this digital age where it is so easy to search for and find information about people.&nbsp; We may say or do something today that we are virulently opposed to years from now, but find statements and actions of our past selves coming back to haunt us years in the future.&nbsp; We don&#39;t know that what we do or say today might be considered taboo in years to come.&nbsp; Imagine a sort of new McCarthyism 30 years from now in which holding liberal democratic views or conservative republican views are deemed illegal or suspect.&nbsp; It&#39;s easy to scoff at the idea that something like that can happen, but these things have a seductive aspect to them under the right conditions.&nbsp; The McCarthy era isn&#39;t all that long ago historically.&nbsp; Internment camps for those with Japanese ancestry weren&#39;t so long before that.&nbsp; Institutional slavery wasn&#39;t too far before that and manifest destiny and indentured servitude weren&#39;t too far before that.&nbsp; We shouldn&#39;t be so secure as to feel that repressive measures can&#39;t or won&#39;t ever be put into place.&nbsp;

				**<br />Privacy advocates slam AT&amp;T on customer records<br /><br />By Ritsuko Ando<br /><br />NEW YORK (Reuters) - Privacy advocates slammed AT&amp;T Inc. on Thursday for declaring that it owned its Internet and video customers&#39; account information and could hand the data over to law enforcement if needed.<br /><br />AT&amp;T on Wednesday updated its privacy policy, which came as the company and other phone operators faced lawsuits claiming they aided a U.S. government domestic spying program by inappropriately handing over millions of call records.<br /><br />&quot;My understanding is that they will be monitoring television viewing habits, and that it&#39;s a condition of service that customers can&#39;t opt out of,&quot; said Paul Stephens, policy analyst at Privacy Rights Clearinghouse.<br /><br />&quot;It&#39;s frightening,&quot; he said.<br /><br />In the policy update, which applied to AT&amp;T&#39;s more than 7 million Internet and video customers, the company said it could collect usage information from subscribers, including the Web pages they view, the programs they record, and the games they play.<br /><br />Customers must agree to the terms, which take effect on Friday, before using AT&amp;T&#39;s services. AT&amp;T&#39;s previous policy guidelines did not explicitly say the company owned customer data.<br /><br />In its broader privacy guidelines, which apply to all retail customers including phone clients, AT&amp;T said it had an obligation to help law enforcement and would act &quot;strictly within the law and under the most stringent conditions.&quot;<br /><br />AT&amp;T SHARES HOLD STEADY<br /><br />Although the news riled privacy advocates, it did not have a big impact on the company&#39;s shares. AT&amp;T was down 0.4 percent at $27.23 in afternoon trade, similar to a 0.3 percent fall in Verizon Communications Inc. .<br /><br />AT&amp;T, Verizon, BellSouth Corp. and Comcast Corp. have been named by media reports as having shared customer information with the National Security Agency.<br /><br />Some of the companies are also facing class action lawsuits and are under scrutiny by privacy advocates.<br /><br />AT&amp;T said it began to review its privacy policy six months ago, and the update was aimed at clarifying its practice and did not change how it treats customer information.<br /><br />But the American Civil Liberties Union said AT&amp;T was trying to give itself license to do what it wants with client data.<br /><br />&quot;By secretly providing customer data to the government outside of any legal channel, AT&amp;T has violated the privacy expectations of Americans - not just the terms of some legalistic privacy policy, but their basic expectations for how private communications will be treated in America,&quot; said Barry Steinhardt, director of the ACLU&#39;s Technology and Liberty Project, in a statement.<br /><br />Sherwin Siy, staff counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said AT&amp;T had likely clarified its policy to protect itself against further accusations.<br /><br />&quot;It&#39;s not protection for consumers but more a waiver of their rights,&quot; he said.<br /><br />AT&amp;T was the first major phone company to explicitly state that it owned customer records since the privacy issue was first raised in a report by the USA Today in May.<br /><br />Verizon said it updated its privacy policy in November 2005 and had no imminent plans for change. The company said it must disclose information to comply with court orders or subpoenas, and to protect its rights or property.<br /><br />Comcast said it reviews its policy on an annual basis.<br /><br />&quot;We do not sell customer information to third parties, and we do not provide customer information in response to legal and law enforcement requests without valid legal process, such as a subpoena or court order,&quot; said Comcast spokeswoman Vibha Agrawal.<br />

				Thanks all for the excellent responses... and it seems that our discussion is in full swing now and can surely only gather momentum until we reach a final synthesis or conclusion. Let&#39;s not drop the topic until each and every one of us feels satisfied that our needs* regarding privacy have been adequately addressed in a satisfactory manner. And if action is still wanting, then let us become proactive in forming a solution.<br /><br />I must confess that the reason for starting this topic is not only because of my long standing fascination with the issue, but I find that more and more (on a personal level) I feel that any rights to privacy that I may (or may not) be privy to are consistently and thoroughly being eroded. Whether it is by a government who claims the right to illegally tap my phone without a warrant, or a company that disregards my constitutional rights against unlawful search and seizure (MTA) and announces such intentions at every available opportunity (perhaps to lull us into a sense that it <em>is</em> ok...), or even an individual (whose authority may only be imagined) that feels the need to display my name (and therefore my identity) on a list that is in full view of the general public expressly against my wishes...i.e. against my will. That such violation is acceptable gives me even more reason to feel uneasy. But more on this later. :)<br /><br />In answer to JCY&#39;s question I can give an opinion. I believe that there should indeed be a different standard by which to measure corporations and governments regard towards privacy. For one...government supposedly represents our will, whereas corporations are only accountable for their own survival and profit. It would be nice if they were legally accountable to all stakeholders, but this vision may only exist in a dream. To continue, no one &quot;elected&quot; corporate bodies to decide policy...so any authority that they wield is not implicit. While theoretically this is the case, I do not dispute that corporations (via lobbyists and positioning) do indeed wield great power in affecting policy decisions and then there always remains the fact that government itself sometimes appoints corporate bodies to act on its (our) behalf.<br /><br />As far as the technical difficulties of removing logs from a database Verizon may keep... still says nothing of whether a disregard for a customers request is ethical or even lawful. If I violate someone&#39;s privacy 4 million times by loosing their data (or by not adequately taking measures to secure against such a loss).... I still must be held liable. If the law mandates that phone logs and records are indeed a customer&#39;s property and a customer requests that such items be removed from Verizon&#39;s keeping then I suppose it is in their best interest to comply (no matter how difficult!)...or pay the penalty of breaking the law (which may in fact be cheaper!)<br /><br />I am also curious about the specific statutes that forbid At&amp;T from handing over their records to the government without a court order but don&#39;t even know where to begin to look. Are there any lawyers out there (not afraid of a little public debate) that may be willing to shed some light on this subject?<br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />*According to Abraham Maslow, human beings have an innate <em>need</em> to feel safe and secure.

				slightly off topic, but related.&nbsp; I just got this from Congressmember Maloney&#39;s office.<br /><br />FYI: As noted in today&#39;s Daily News editorial, Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney, a senior Member of the House Financial Services Committee, demanded immediate hearings on the Bush administration&#39;s secret program -- implemented without congressional approval, and operating without court-approved warrants or subpoenas -- to monitor hundreds of thousands of Americans&#39; banking transactions.&nbsp; Representative Maloney is the Ranking Democratic Member of the House Domestic and International Monetary Policy, Trade and Technology Subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over the administrationâ€™s bank record surveillance program.&nbsp; Following are links to Congresswoman Maloney&#39;s release announcing her call for hearings on the controversial program, in which she said, &quot;I am deeply concerned that this administration is perhaps acting without regard for basic legal protections and expectations in forcing the international banking community to provide confidential data&quot;; to today&#39;s Daily News editorial; and to yesterday&#39;s New York Times article revealing the program&#39;s existence, which described it as <br />&quot;stir(ring) concerns inside the administration about legal and privacy issues.&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />http://www.maloney.house.gov/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1138&amp;Itemid=61<br />&nbsp;<br />http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ideas_opinions/story/429413p-362061c.html<br />&nbsp;<br />http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/23/washington/23intel.html<br />&nbsp;<br />

				I am shocked that the Bush Administration was able to monitor the wire transfer banking transactions of Swift, because it is an international banking association database. If they were able to do that without congressional approval, that must mean they are also monitoring the domestic wire transfers which are made through Fedwire, Chips and Automated Clearing House. Banks are already required to have all this info on file for at least five years in case they receive a warrant or subpoena on a custoemr or a payment. <br /><br />If the Feds are already data-mining the wire transfer systems, then there is no privacy or civil liberties left.&nbsp; By law warrants require just cause and a judge&#39;s approval. They are circumventing all of that.

				Being that the Swift wire transfers go through a myriad of domestic US corresponding banks, there is no feasible way to datamine only foreign banks from the mix, unless they exclude US dollar payments. I&#39;ve been in the biz for 20 years, and I know all wire transfer systems and methods inside and out. Foreign transfers can and do go from US bank to US bank. There is no such thing as strictly domestic in Swift. If they exclude USD wires, then they would be missing the very point of their mission. What they say they are doing and what they are actually doing are not necessarly the same thing. <br /><br />Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.

While it&#39;s mostly likely that a payment from Citibank NY to Bank of America in SF will go by Fedwire, if the banks maintain correspondent accounts with each other (many do), they will you Swift, since it&#39;s much cheaper and even easier.<br /><br />Transfer payments can be complicated, since they can have several intermediate parties between the sender and receiver. You can send a transfer from a US bank to a US bank, but the beneficiary bank can be a foreign bank maintaining an account with that US bank. There no way to exclude those payments, and anyone with transfer experience worth their weight in salt knows that.

				Yes they are the same, although you can probably add the electronic checks to that list, known as ACH payments (or Automated Clearing House payments). Those would be the automated deposits or payments that you&#39;ve arranged to go in or out of your bank account such as direct deposits, and scheduled bill payments.

				Personal Story #1:<br /><br />Another aspect of privacy is how we chose to define or not define ourselves. Legally, I can refer to myself as anything I want, whether it be Dr.Zeno, Mickey Mouse or Jesus Christ. As long as I do not commit a crime using these names or attempt to defraud or practice unlicensed appendectomies then my right to self-definition is on par with my right to the pursuit of happiness...an eminently traditional American way of thinking about things.<br /><br />It is only where there is a conflict of interest between my privacy and some other principle (such as credibility) that we run into problems. Before I expose the incidents that have led me to start posting on the subject of privacy, I will skirt around the issue for just a small amount of time more in order to give the offending party time to save face and rectify the mistake that he or she has made in regard to my privacy. The main issue indeed revolves around the use of my name in a public space expressly against my wishes. A note to the person in question: By exhibiting such behavior I will take it to mean that I also have license to use your given name in a public forum in the name of &quot;professionalism&quot; as well, the Law must apply equally to all after all, right?<br /><br />Incident #1: I was approached by a reporter for Newsday at the weekly CSA meeting and was asked to be interviewed. Much like last year I said sure, but would I have to give my name. I already knew the answer. For reasons of credibility reporters need to be able to verify their sources, so they won&#39;t be accused of just &quot;making up&quot; their journalistic pieces.<br />What bothered me was the response I got. The reporter in question asked me sarcastically,<br />&quot;What, are you a spy?&quot; She then went on to say that she would just find someone else, clearly she didn&#39;t want my input. <br /><br />Since when does the unwillingness to give up my name or my privacy equate me with being a spy? I understand the question was put to me unseriously, but in light of this mentality which we were allowed to glimpse through the keyhole of a jest let us again turn our eyes to our brothers and sisters living in countries where the culture of privacy is non-existent and look again at the fruits of what such cultures bring to their citizens in the way of self-determination, equality and freedom. Question: Is privacy to be valued even cherished? Or are we better off without it?

				@ enigmacat: It also doesn&#39;t hurt if you happen to be friendly with the neighbor with the dispute in question. You know, I am tired of having people with no authority whatsoever trying&nbsp; to assume leadership roles and thereby ruining the quality of life for everybody, because where they are trying to lead goes against all principles of respect, democracy and courtesy. This is a community board and I have a public grievance that affects the community, and I will air that grievance. Many like yourself will choose to ignore incoming data (or at least say they will), but&nbsp; I believe that many will read and learn what I have to say and either agree or reject it based upon reflection and the light of reason.<br /><br />The issue that I talk about... Privacy is an important issue. And ideas such as privacy are more than just some abstract concepts that exist in a vacuum. They are either respected or violated in our daily lives by people that we know. Pray, tell me...what is the function of such a board?

				Now that I am shaken from my stupor by obvious and and transparent stupidity, let me relate incident number two...and please Fellow Astorians.... feel free to relate your own brushes with privacy, whether it be the affirmation or violation thereof:<br /><br />Incident #2: This is actually a pleasant incident. I needed a tape recorder to play some rapidly going out of style books on tape. Throughout my life I have run through many such devices. They last a certain amount of time and then kaput, I need to buy another. This time I would do things differently. I decided to pay an extra $5.00 for a 1-year warranty. I decided to take the plunge.<br /><br />The clerk then asked me for my name to register my warranty and I said, &quot;I don&#39;t feel like giving you my name. Can I give you a made up one?&quot; He replied that I could, so I furnished him with the name &quot;Zeno&quot;. He then told me...something that I heard before.... that he was using a database that had two fields that <em>had</em> (for technical reasons) to be filled in: namely a First Name Field, and a Last Name field. I said, &quot;Not a problem, just enter &#39;Zeno&#39; in both the fields. The result was &#39;Zeno Zeno&#39;. We both laughed at that. When it came to an address something similar transpired...I said, &quot;Can we use this address?&quot; And the address of the outlet of the famous franchise electronics store was duly entered, thus protecting both my privacy and my new found respect for the company because of it&#39;s utilization of the current CRM (Customer Relationship Management) model, now being adopted by necessity by &quot;professional&quot; businesses everywhere. The model states that rather than devoting resources to finding new customers, care, time and resources should be devoted to retaining old ones not only by satisfying them but by exceeding their expectations.<br /><br />Of course, we may question the motives of the employee in protecting my privacy. It could argued convincingly that the motive was one of making a sale perhaps even in direct contradiction to corporate policy. The end result is the same however: as a customer I was pleased and as a business they can count not only on my future patronage but my glowing word of mouth endorsements as well (for whatever that may be worth).

				i guess i&#39;ll have to social engineer the clueless radiohax clerk to tell me (like you did).&nbsp; and i won&#39;t mind invading your privacy to do so!<br /><br />what&#39;s funny btw is how you mistook that clerk&#39;s willingness to put in dummy data as respect for your privacy.&nbsp; more than likely he just wanted the commission on the warranty money.&nbsp; so in reality, it was all capitalist instinct baby.

				I strongly value my privacy, but I never mind giving companies my name and mailing address - I&#39;d balk at social security numbers and I always refuse to give my phone number (I&#39;m learning email addresses get lots of spam if you put them on these forms as well).&nbsp; I&#39;ve always thought the purpose of warranties was to make sure they could contact you if there was an upgrade, a recall or if you wanted to get it fixed, and that you&#39;d have to show proof of purchase or at least that you had a valid warranty.&nbsp; Can you really get things repaired without them having your name?&nbsp; Did you pay cash or did they get your name off your credit card?

				Woa, Jcy!<br /><br />Obviously you haven&#39;t read my post carefully enough. I never mistook the motivation of the clerk in reaching for his commission...yet the end result was the same. In case you don&#39;t want to read it again which I highly suspect, I&#39;ll quote myself:&nbsp; <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It could argued convincingly that the motive was one of making a sale perhaps even in direct contradiction to corporate policy.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>And as far as social engineering the clerk into giving you the name of the model and so repair any defective tape recorder you may have (even without a receipt) well, that is certainly worth more than $5.00 to witness. Let me know how you make out. :)<br /><br />This brings me to wonder however, just what the store&#39;s policy is concerning supplying made up data when it comes to warranties and whether or not they are bound to honor them.<br /><br />@mcdirk: I may be considered paranoid, but giving one&#39;s name may be just as significant as giving one&#39;s address, telephone number, social security # and medical history as all of these things can easily be deduced from it. A name is one&#39;s identity and if I&#39;m not mistaken one&#39;s &quot;property&quot; as well. Of course I may be wrong here in this regard, but having my name bought, sold or traded between companies without my permission gives me a dirty kind of feeling, like I&#39;ve been violated somehow. But this is just me. I don&#39;t mind giving my name to people that I like or trust. But if some stranger came up to you on the street and wanted your information, what would you say?<br /><br />On the warranty I paid cash. I got a receipt. I am also curious if they will honor it. I doubt that there will be an upgrade to the tape recorder :) but I am confident that if it breaks (through normal use) that they will honor it (the warranty).<br /><br />But surely someone else has stories of their own to relate: Jcy? Mcdirk? Enigmacat? Surely at one time or another during your lives you have had your privacy violated. What were the events? How did it make you feel? Was there a way to prevent such violation? And if so, should such measures be practiced in the future even if such procedures are not practiced or accepted by the population at large? I have had experiences in the past involving a stalker who used my name in order to establish where I lived and so pester me. There is a distinct reason (besides being a fundamental right) why I choose to treat my name with the respect that any other form of identity deserves. <br /><br />Also, I don&#39;t think anyone has tackled the dichotomy between the right to privacy and the right to free speech. Many times these two rights come into conflict with one another, such as in cases of National Security versus journalistic exposÃ©s. Should private individuals have the same or similar rights to government agencies or corporations in regards to privacy?<br /><br />Thanks all for the input :) !

				Zeno,<br /><br />Thanks for posting an interesting discussion starter about privacy.&nbsp; I would be very much interested in seeing the article you mentioned.&nbsp; I also noticed a discussion underway about privacy in a general sense.&nbsp; Perhaps we can talk about specific privacy issues.&nbsp; Such as the recent media attention towards President Bush&#39;s decision to wire tap telephones.&nbsp; Is that an invasion to our right to privacy?<br /><br />What about free speech in relation to privacy.&nbsp; A friend of mine said that if one said Osama bin Laden several times on the telephone it could initiate a wiretap.&nbsp; Is this true, as outlandish as it sounds.&nbsp;

				Solange - I hope it hasn&#39;t come to that, but with this administration in power, it honestly wouldn&#39;t surprise me.&nbsp; They even have the LGBT association at the NYU Law School listed as a possible terrorist group, due to someone heckling Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and their name, &quot;Outlaw&quot; (means out in law school, not outlaws, like the Bush administration alleges).
