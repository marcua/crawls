I need to spend some more time exploring it before I make any more shots of it. It&#039;s photographed so much that it&#039;s hard not to capture a cliche image. Just stand in the Main Concourse for a few minutes and count hot many people walk up the stairs at the east or west ends and stop directly in the middle and take a picture. Or how many times people stand in the middle of the busy commuter traffic and snap a pic while dragging their shutter, so the crowd becomes a blur of commotion. I&#039;ve got a couple ideas. I just hope they turn out the way I want.<br /><br />My setup is pretty simple actually. I have a Nikon D90 and just three non-pro grade lenses -- Sigma 10-20mm, Nikon 16-85mm, and Nikon 70-300mm. My most unusual piece of gear is a Singh-Ray variable neutral density filter. It was a little pricey and was a treat to myself, but it&#039;s also one of those items that I need to take capture some of the images I make. There&#039;s a lot of equipment I would like, but I try really hard not to become a gear head. I prefer to work with what I have and work the limitations and boundaries into the images that I produce. I&#039;m pretty sure if I could afford the $5k+ cameras and a dozen $2k+ lenses I wouldn&#039;t spend as much time thinking about how I&#039;m going to capture some of the images that I take because I would probably be too absorbed in acquiring gear. Now having said that, if anyone wants to give me big fancy lenses, camera bodies, and other equipment I won&#039;t in a million years turn them down. ;-)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=15516.msg177492.html#msg177492">Quote from: Starwind51 on July 10, 2009, 12:34:34 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Can you edit out the watermellon and the cantaloupe?&nbsp; I&#039;m sort of allergic.&nbsp; ( lol ) Is the one of the snail in Astoria?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I don&#039;t know what I would do if I was allergic to any kind of fruit. I love &#039;em all so much. But just for you next time I will try a substitution for the watermelon and cantaloupe -- any suggestions?<br /><br />Yep, the pic of the snail is in Astoria down by the river. Good eye! :-)

				I forgot to say, pictures of Jolly Rancher watermellon candy are fine, as are pictures of flat watermellon flavored coconut candy.&nbsp; For some reason I can tollerate the smell and taste of them.&nbsp; But this is getting off topic.

				<strong>Manhattanhenge // 2009</strong><br /><br />(http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3517/3715216925_a8a37a5649_m.jpg)<br />View Full Image @ Flickr (http://www.flickr.com/photos/manicmaurice/3715216925/)<br /><br />I couldn&#039;t resist the urge to shoot Manhattanhenge. I started out at the Tudor City Bridge (42nd St &amp; 2nd Ave), but there must have been at least a hundred photographers there, so I moved to a secret location that I scouted out the day before. ;-)

				Was this the first or second?&nbsp; I just checked the dates and found I managed to miss it twice in one year.&nbsp; I looked at the Wikipedia - the give the dates for the sunrises as well.<br /><br />For the sunsets, try the view from Roosevelt Island.&nbsp; Looking at the Microsoft Bing map of R.I., north of &quot;Ecological Park&quot; is an old house, and just north of there, I believe, was the old cooking grill/private picnic area, and that&#039;s where I was when I first noticed the sunset phenomenon.

The first day (Saturday July 11th) was all overcast with storm clouds and so the sunset wasn&#039;t visible. Check out the links I posted with my photo. They gives the dates of the event for 2009 and they are full of background info.<br /><br />Thanks for the tip on the Roosevelt Island spot. The event is partially visible for several days prior and several days after, so over the next few days I&#039;m going to be trying to catch as many cool Manhattan sunset pics as I can. I spent a good deal of my day yesterday with a good friend exploring and taking pictures on Roosevelt Island. We decided it kind of feels like the Dharma Project from LOST over there. ;-)

				That bridge in Tudor City is insane during Manhattanhenge...&nbsp; I tried to go there during the May 31 event earlier this year and there were already 50 people there 90 mins before sunset and tripods already setup in key locations.&nbsp; I wandered to Bryant Park instead and got these:<br /><br />&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/jasonslogic/3617123717/&quot; title=&quot;Sunset Down 41st St by Jason Arends, on Flickr&quot;&gt;(http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3305/3617123717_babebf784c_m.jpg)[/url] &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/jasonslogic/3617122965/&quot; title=&quot;Sunset Down 42nd St by Jason Arends, on Flickr&quot;&gt;(http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3323/3617122965_b39d856949_m.jpg)[/url]<br /><br />Gantry Plaza is also a decent place to get pics of the sunset when it lines up - I took this one on July 4, so it was a few days off, but I think any later and the sun would be too low to see from there.&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t lined up with 42nd street exactly, but you could see the beam of sunlight lining up:<br /><br />&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/jasonslogic/3688401473/&quot; title=&quot;Sunset down 42nd St by Jason Arends, on Flickr&quot;&gt;(http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2570/3688401473_dc32e01b1d_m.jpg)[/url]

				Well, My day started out planning to enjoy the closure of Park Ave for Summer Streets...alas, I realized that the streets were closed from 7am to 1pm....at 1:15pm......never the less, I took the journey I planned and here are a few pics that I enjoyed.<br /><br /><br />Distortion on the Lever Building<br />(http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3540/3825663830_01baaa6467.jpg)<br /><br />At first I thought the sky was too bright...but I like this rendition<br />(http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2578/3824863725_e6993a2ddb_m.jpg)<br /><br />Close up of the main portal at St Barts. <br />(http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2425/3824865647_d953a02db3.jpg)<br /><br />\And last of all....a detail of the corner of the Chrysler Building<br />(http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2426/3825667034_9bb3f63fe7.jpg)
