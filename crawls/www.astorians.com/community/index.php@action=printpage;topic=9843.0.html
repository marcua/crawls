				Over the weekend I was trying to get a cab back to Astoria from the UES.&nbsp; This is around 3PM on a Saturday.&nbsp; I get a cab to pull over (the light said it was available and not off-duty). The driver lets me in, and after I tell him where I&#039;m going he says &quot;I&#039;m off-duty and going home, didn&#039;t you see my light?&quot;.&nbsp; Now, I&#039;m not a tourist...I know how to hail a cab correctly.&nbsp; So the guy was clearly lying because he didn&#039;t want to go to Queens.&nbsp; Unfortunately I neglected to get his medallion number to report to 311.<br /><br />Are yellow cabs allowed to refuse service like that?&nbsp; I was under the impression that you were entitled to go anywhere within the 5 boroughs.&nbsp; Plus, I&#039;m like a 5 minute drive from the Queensboro so we&#039;re not talking about the other end of Queens.&nbsp; This is the second time in about 6 months that this has happened.&nbsp; That time, the driver just flat-out refused to go to Queens.&nbsp; WTF?

				No, they&#039;re not supposed to refuse service to any of the five boroughs. <br /><br />A few years ago I reported a driver who did that to me - wouldn&#039;t go from <br />Times Square to Astoria late on a Saturday night. I reported him with his<br />medallion number to the Taxi &amp; Limo commission. They gave me a hearing<br />about 2 months later with an arbitrator. The person listed to each of us and<br />found in my favor. The driver was given a warning since it was supposedly a <br />first offense. <br /><br />But I was pleased with the process because it was good to know that this<br />is taken seriously. Plus I found the people at the TLC very helpful&nbsp; - a guard even<br />walked me out and to the train station because she didn&#039;t want the driver to try to<br />speak to me afterward.<br /><br />Next time - hopefully there won&#039;t be one - get their number and report them.<br />If enough people do that, hopefully it won&#039;t keep happening.

				No, they&#039;re not allowed to refuse to take you to Queens. (See #2 on the Riders Bill of Rights (http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/passenger/taxicab_rights.shtml)). <br /><br />I find that if I say &quot;Astoria Queens&quot;, I usually get a better response than just saying Queens.

				Check out page 36 in therules for cab drivers. (http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/downloads/pdf/drivrules.pdf)<br /><br />The only way that the exceptions apply is if his off-duty light was on before you got in. If he&#039;d turned the light on after the last passengers left and then you got into the cab, he&#039;s allowed to refuse.

				In my case, the driver had NOT turned on the off-duty lights, specifically pulled over to me when I hailed from the curb (i.e. I didn&#039;t walk up to a cab letting passengers out), unlocked the passenger door, let me sit down in the cab, and THEN refused after I told him where I was going.&nbsp; Someone who was legitimately off-duty probably would have said something before I was able to even get in the cab.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had that experience before.&nbsp; So to me, that was shady.<br /><br />ladydi - I am very glad to hear that at least there is some recourse for passengers when this does happen.<br />

				the only reason I can think of that would make him refuse the ride would be the traffic situation on the east side at the time. this was about an hour after the crane collapse, right? It doesn&#039;t make it right, since he could have asked you if you wanted to go over the TriB instead and pay the toll. <br /><br />The area around the QB would have been a parking lot with all the street closings.

				I&#039;ve never had this problem, and I&#039;ve been taking cabs home from west midtown fairly often for the last three years. I just say &quot;Astoria, please&quot; and the intersection. Then I tell him to take the upper level because it&#039;s much more pleasant a ride than the lower level through the Queens Plaza area. I recommend just saying Astoria as opposed to saying Queens. But yes, if he does refuse you you should get his medallion number and report him.

				I <strong>never</strong> announce where I&#039;m going until I&#039;m in the cab.&nbsp; I&#039;ve gotten into shouting matches with cab drivers (the most memorable of which was at La Guardia), but I&#039;ve never backed down, and I have in the end always managed to get driven to Astoria (or Brooklyn in the old days).&nbsp; I read their medallion number to them out loud, write it down, tell them I am calling in a complaint immediately, and nowadays take out my cell phone and start dialling 311, or the 212 number in the back of the cab if it&#039;s during business hours.

				I had a refusal a bit over a year ago, just told me flat out he would not take me to Queens and to get out of the cab.&nbsp; I told him I was going to call and report him and he didn&#039;t care, at least not until we were in our arbitration hearing two months later.&nbsp; He apologized and got a few points against his hack license.&nbsp; It&#039;s not a difficult process and it&#039;s important to hold the cab drivers accountable when they do refuse, else they&#039;ll do it more often.&nbsp; I have to go back again next month for a situation that happened in December - my friend had invited me to his concert on the UES and after the performance his grandmother&#039;s car service did not show up.&nbsp; We hailed a yellow cab and after she got in, he refused to take her to the Bronx.&nbsp; Can you imagine throwing an 85 year old woman out of a cab at 11 p.m. at night?&nbsp; I&#039;m actually looking forward to the hearing.&nbsp; At least he threw her out in front of us instead of a few blocks away, but it&#039;s the principle that just incenses me.

Sometimes being a bit aggressive pays off. Who cares if the driver is huffing &amp; puffing the whole way home? Get in the car, say &quot;Astoria, Steinway &amp; Broadway&quot; (or whatever your intersection is), and then if they give you crap, say, &quot;hang on, I&#039;ve gotta write down your medallion number now so I can report this - do you have the time? What&#039;s today&#039;s date? You know, by the time I&#039;m done calling this in, I could have been home.&quot; (Don&#039;t get out of the car to call!)<br /><br />I understand the cab driver&#039;s stance in most cases (gas is expensive, it&#039;s harder to get a fare in the outer buroughs, but it&#039;s the law! And it&#039;s not like Astoria is hours and hours away - we&#039;re just across the bridge! (either QB or Triboro, or take the BQE up! NO BIGGIE.) And if they go down Crescent or Steinway to get back to Manhattan, they have a chance of picking up a local fare again before they get back to the city.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know about the rest of you guys, but I live in New York City, I expect to be able to get to where I need to go to fairly easily without having to drive myself, no matter what time it is.

				Of course the hearing is during the week. That&#039;s when government offices/departments are in<br />session. If it was on Saturday morning, you&#039;d complain that it was wrecking your weekend.<br /><br />When I put my complaint in, they did schedule it on a weekday during lunchtime - I think<br />it was at 12:30 or 1:00. I told my bosses what I was doing and the whole thing took slightly over an<br />hour. The TLC office was downtown and didn&#039;t take long to get to and I wasn&#039;t out very long.<br />Plus everyone in my office thought it was great that I was pushing this to get some kind of result.<br /><br />This is why though things like this don&#039;t get better. People cry and moan but when they have to take<br />real action and make some effort, it&#039;s not worth their time. That&#039;s why they shouldn&#039;t complain.......

				1) Once you are physically in the cab, he cannot force you out.&nbsp; So before even saying a word, get in the cab.&nbsp; There has been only one occassion where a cabbie has refused to move for me.&nbsp; But in that instance, I stayed put.&nbsp; I said, &quot;either you go or we can be double-parked here and wait for a cop&quot;.&nbsp; Begrudgingly, he left.<br /><br />2) When you get into a cab, do not disclose the location.&nbsp; Give a direction.&nbsp; So, for example, instead of saying &quot;Queens&quot; or &quot;Astoria&quot;, say &quot;go down 23rd, toward 3rd avenue&quot;.&nbsp; The driver then thinks you&#039;re destination is still in Manhattan.&nbsp; Then when you approach 3rd, then say &quot;make a left and toward the 59th Street bridge and take the upper/lower level&quot;.&nbsp; At that point, he&#039;s done.&nbsp; He can&#039;t force you out of the car since you&#039;re already in the care and he has a fair.&nbsp; <br /><br />3) There&#039;s a rule somewhere I heard about that Yellow cabs can&#039;t (or are limited in) pick up fairs in the outer boroughs.&nbsp; I was heard this when I asked why you don&#039;t see nearly as many Yellow cabs as you do Livery one&#039;s (and why there are so few Livery cabs in Manhattan as opposed to Yellow ones).&nbsp; And Livery cab drivers, at least in my experience, tend to charge more in Manhattan than Yellow cab...probably because there&#039;s no meter that you can dispute with them.&nbsp; I try and avoid Livery cabs in Manhattan.<br /><br />4) It is a good idea to point the Yellow cabs to local places where they can pick-up fares.&nbsp; The beer garden is a good place.&nbsp; I normally steer them toward 31st street along the train tracks, where they can get someone who may need to get to Manhattan faster.&nbsp; And since 31st street eventually leads to the lower level of the 59th street bridge, it&#039;s an easy way to lead them home and not get lost.<br /><br />5) A decent tip never hurts either.

				Well yeah, I thought it was assumed you get in the car before telling/asking the driver where you&#039;re going. Since it&#039;s the law that he must take you anywhere in the 5 boroughs, you don&#039;t need to ask first. <br /><br />And I&#039;m pretty sure there isn&#039;t any rule about yellow cabs not being able to pick up fares in the outer boroughs. It&#039;s just more difficult for them because there are generally more cab takers at random points in Manhattan than around Queens, especially at night.

				Hmmm, over the years I found that if you head home around midnight you are less likely to be refused. Since a large number of Cab Co&#039;s are based in Astoria or LIC, the driver is heading back anyway- he can make that last fare on the way.<br /><br />And as a sidenote- when getting a taxi at LaGuardia to Astoria, make SURE to tell the dispatcher you are going LOCAL. He will sometimes give the driver a pass to get back to the front of the line instead of having to wait in that big lot. It makes it easier on the driver and he won&#039;t get all PO&#039;d that he waited an hour for a $6 fare.

				Years&nbsp; ago, 70&#039;s, 80&#039;s cabs would never leave&nbsp; Manhattan to go Queens, especially on weekends, cause they were routinely&nbsp; mugged&nbsp; and shot dead. But, things&nbsp; have&nbsp; vastly improved since those&nbsp; days. One of the&nbsp; reasons&nbsp; they don&#039;t go now, is they won&#039;t find&nbsp; anyone to go back&nbsp; with, so they see it as wasting gas. But, even that&nbsp; is not true, since Queens&nbsp; is&nbsp; much more livlier&nbsp; now, than years&nbsp; ago. Personally, rarely do Igo to Manhattan anymore&nbsp; on weekends and when&nbsp; I do, Bus, Train or even the non-yellow&nbsp; cabs&nbsp; are enough, the latter&nbsp; guys&nbsp; would take&nbsp; you&nbsp; to&nbsp; Hunts&nbsp; Point at midnight if you pauid them enough.&nbsp; Good Luck. :lol:

				Also back in the 70&#039;s and 80&#039;s, there was a Taxi Stand right at the corner of 59th Street and 2nd Avenue where the hacks who were going off-duty or otherwise headed into Queens would line up and be more than happy to take a fare over the bridge into Queens.&nbsp; But that, like many other things that made sense back in the old days, seemed to vanish.<br /><br />Many times I would just walk down from the upper east side and hop into a cab there over the bridge.&nbsp; Oddly enough, some people would try to get one of the cabs that were there for a ride downtown or elsewhere in Manhattan and were rudely refused!&nbsp; And I believe at the time it was OK for the drivers to do that because they were at a Taxi Stand and outside of their cabs.

				Never give the cabbie too much information - they are strictly NEED TO KNOW, in my opinion.&nbsp; They are not doing you a favor; you are paying them, so they need to go where ever you ask. <br /><br />I used to live a couple of block north of Ditmars, in an area that a lot of drivers didn&#039;t seem familiar with.&nbsp; So I would just tell them, &quot;going to Astoria, take the upper level&quot;.

				One thing that I have noticed is that the cabs driving down Crescent St. towards Manhattan will often have their off-duty lights on so as not to pick up a fare that would keep them in Astoria.&nbsp; However, they will pull over when hailed and ask where you are going.&nbsp; They get very happy when they have a fare going into Manhattan.<br /><br />I&#039;m not a big fan of taking gypsy cabs -- you never know who you&#039;re getting in with.&nbsp; I got really lucky recently when I stepped out of Cavo one night and found an empty yellow cab in front!

				Maybe he&#039;s just a jerk like a lot of the cab drivers.&nbsp; :? I remember this one time when &quot;me &#039;n the gang&quot; were going to go pick up a friend in Jackson Heights, and we flagged down a cab and got in. We told him where we were going and he started up the car. This was in the summer, and it was a particularly hot day, so I turned on the little AC that all cabs have in the bottom. We all heard a scraping noise near the front, and the cab died. The guy started yelling at us like crazy that we don&#039;t turn on the AC and stuff like that. He said it as if he told us about it the moment we got in. I screamed right back that the SOB should TAKE CARE OF HIS CAB, so that it won&#039;t break down when someone did something as innocent as turning on the frikken&#039; AC!! Thank GOD for 311!!

				I&#039;ve lived in Western Queens (first Sunnyside, now Astoria) for the last 12 years and EVERYTIME I get into a cab in Manhattan I hold my breath after I tell them where I want to go.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t gotten a refusal lately but I always expect one.&nbsp; One of the things I do now is after I get into the cab, I smile and greet them with, &quot;Good Morning&quot; (or evening or whatever).&nbsp; I do this because I suspect that they experience very little civility and I imagine that that wears the soul down.&nbsp; I think of it as a little bit of &quot;pay it forward&quot; decency.&nbsp; I then say, &quot;I&#039;m going to Astoria, please, thank you so much&quot; - in a really nice way.&nbsp; At this point, the only conflict I run into is the chosen route.&nbsp; If I&#039;m downtown many cabbies want to take the Williamsburg and I&#039;ve done the math and invariably it adds on at least $4 to my ride, so unless I know for a fact that the 59th is a parking lot I ALWAYS insist on it and 99 times out of a 100 it&#039;s fine.&nbsp; Plus - when was the last time the BQE WASN&#039;T a nightmare?&nbsp; I got into such a bad fight with a cabbie a few weeks ago about the route I called the police because I felt endangered - I had jumped out of the cab at this point and he came after me - he was clearly crazy.<br /><br />If I&#039;m every refused again I will report it.&nbsp; However, late at night I don&#039;t like the idea of pissing off a taxi driver if I&#039;m riding alone.&nbsp; Regardless, I usually have them drop me off a few houses away from where I live and I wait until they&#039;re out of sight before I go to mine.&nbsp; There are many many creepy drivers out there.

				Wow daisy, that sucks.&nbsp; Sounds very similar to my original post that started this thread in the first place.&nbsp; It&#039;s good that you reported it - these jerks should not be allowed to get away with refusing service.<br /><br />FYI - I had another refusal last month myself.&nbsp; I was with my sis-in-law who&#039;s on the UES and we asked the cabbie to make a stop to drop her off first and then a stop in Queens for me (she&#039;s close to the 59th St bridge).&nbsp; We do this all the time without an issue.&nbsp; On this night though, the driver gave some s___ about how he wasn&#039;t gonna go uptown and then back down into Queens or something ridiculous like that.&nbsp; So we calmly told him we were going to report him to TLC and got out of the cab and luckily got another one without a problem.&nbsp; My SIL did send in a complaint since we had the medallion # this time and got a response back about a hearing as well.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know what&#039;s up with these cabbies - I guess they don&#039;t need the money?

				Well, I just wasted my entire morning trying to get some justice in this case.&nbsp; I was scheduled for a hearing this morning regarding the cab refusal to take me to Queens.&nbsp; I waited about 45 minutes for the hearing to start, and more actually because I was early, only to have the hearing postponed because the cabbie pulled a fast one by asking for a postponement so he could get an attorney.&nbsp; &nbsp;Apparently, his was too busy to bother representing him that day, although the only reason he mentioned the supposed attorney was because the judge asked him if he understood he had a right to one.&nbsp; So I had to waste 4 hours of my day only to have it postponed, because even though he was so last minute with it, he was still entitled to have it postponed.&nbsp; <br /><br />This day is off to a bad start.&nbsp; &nbsp;:x<br /><br />

				I am a very nice person who respects employees of various service industries. I almost never send food back at restaurants, etc. But I have run out of patience with cabbies who illegally refuse to go to Astoria. It&#039;s a flat out joke, especially considering it is shorter in mileage often than going way uptown or way downtown in manhattan!<br /><br />I get into arguments all the time now with cab drivers because they tell me they can&#039;t take me home roughly 33% of the time. It is illegal, and I threaten to call 311 immediately. Do not put up with this crap, guys. It is their job to take us home, so make sure they do it correctly.<br /><br />GO METS!

				It&#039;s worth calling 311 when this happens. It doesn&#039;t take long to set up an appointment with the T&amp;LC. If you don&#039;t show up, the cabbie doesn&#039;t get fined, but they do have to take the time to go downtown and wait. If they have to do that every time they refuse service to an OB, they&#039;ll pretty soon stop refusing service.<br /><br />Also, get in the cab before you tell them where you&#039;re going. They&#039;re not nearly as likely to kick you out of their cab once you&#039;re inside.

				Some cabbies just don&#039;t like to go over the bridge, ,they prefer to stay in Manhattan, because they get more customers that way. I was never refused to be taken to Astoria, but several times the drivers appeared to be annoyed. They hear Queens, and assume it&#039;s one of the bad areas like Jamaica, even though Astoria is safe and only about half the travel time.

				I didn&#039;t read through all the responses, but these are the rules if no one has mentioned them.<br /><br />Cabs must take you where ever you want in the tristate area. <br /><br />It is against the law to have a cab driver pick and choose who they drive and where.&nbsp; So this means driving around with the off duty light and then asking people where they are going is not allowed. <strong>IF THEY ASK TELL THEM TO GET LOST(I TELL THEM THIS IN MY OWN WAY)</strong><br /><br />If they get reported then they get fined $1000.<br /><br />If you have trouble getting cabs then you are doing it all wrong!&nbsp; I NEVER have problems getting a cab ride back to Astoria...unless its NYE.<br /><br />What you must do is never ever ever answer someone who asks where you are going.&nbsp; Always get in the cab and then tell them where you are going.&nbsp; If anyone ever gives you a problem for whatever reason take a pic of the medallion with your camara phone and then tell them that you will report them if they don&#039;t take you.&nbsp; If they still refuse then get out and the next day report them.&nbsp; I&#039;ve only threaten someone&nbsp; once and I was very convincing, they drove me to Astoria.<br /><br /><strong>Everytime you get to Astoria by cab get out and at the very least tip the guy 2-3 bucks.&nbsp; Don&#039;t be a scummer, its a pain in the ass to drive to Astoria.&nbsp; If that&#039;s too expensive then you have no business taking a cab</strong><br /><br />The above only applies to yellow cabs.&nbsp; Gypsy cabs have no real rules and livery cabs aren&#039;t supposed to pick you up off the street.&nbsp; They get fined $1000 if they get caught picking people up like yellow cabs do. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I had a cab driver indirectly refuse my ride to Queens recently.&nbsp; I work late and frequently take cabs to Astoria from the Upper West Side.&nbsp; This was the first time in quite some time this had happened. Basically, the driver said because of bad weather the bridges were really jammed and I was better off just taking the train.&nbsp; When I said, &quot;Ok, then take the tunnel&quot; he said, &quot;Oh that&#039;s really backed-up too.&quot;&nbsp; I told him if he didn&#039;t want to take me to Queens he should just come out and say it but obviously, since this is against taxi regulations, he was like &quot;No, no, I&#039;m just trying to do you a favor.&quot;<br /><br />There are plenty of yellow cabs out there and unless you are a in a really tough spot trying to find one I find the best policy in these situations is not to force the issue but to simply find a driver who is amenable to taking you.&nbsp; I do not feel safe being in a moving vehicle by myself with someone who does not want to take me where I need to do.&nbsp; Moreover, why give this guy my money?&nbsp; I got out and hailed a cab right across the street from where I was and the driver was more than happy to take me to Astoria.

				Hi all- I did a forum search for this, but I was wondering if anyone has successfully went to a hearing regarding a cab driver who refused service. I am specifically referring to hailing a cab in Manhattan, closing the door, telling the cab driver my destination, and being thrown out on the street. <br /><br />I was wondering if the cab driver is told of my address/name if I file a complaint. I got his medallion number and name and submitted a request on 311. I am probably just paranoid but if I file the complaint and go to the hearing, will the cab driver know my address and be able to get back at me? <br /><br />Thanks for all advice. Thanks.

				Yep, I did!!&nbsp; I&#039;m going to merge this thread with the other one, and you can read about everyone&#039;s experience there.&nbsp; &nbsp;The cabbie will not know your address.&nbsp; In fact, he is asked to leave the room when the judge has you write down your address so you can informed of the result.&nbsp; You show up to the hearing, which is in a small office and testify about what happened, and then they mail you the ruling.<br /><br />Best advice I was given:&nbsp; The cabbie will most likely have a lawyer who will try to intimidate you.&nbsp; Do not look at either one, and speak directly to the judge.&nbsp; Remember all the facts of the case off the top of your head, and state your experience to the judge directly and calmly.&nbsp; They hear cases like this all the time and from what I experienced, they are not on the cabbie&#039;s side.&nbsp; If anything, they are impartial but I&#039;m sure they hear the same bullshit stories from the cabbies everyday.

I am specifically referring to hailing a cab in Manhattan, closing the door, telling the cab driver my destination, and being thrown out on the street. <br /><br />I was wondering if the cab driver is told of my address/name if I file a complaint. I got his medallion number and name and submitted a request on 311. I am probably just paranoid but if I file the complaint and go to the hearing, will the cab driver know my address and be able to get back at me? <br /><br />Thanks for all advice. Thanks. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />They don&#039;t get your address and I think it&#039;s important to file these complaints and send a strong message that they have to follow the rules and take people to boroughs outside Manhattan.&nbsp; I have had a number of TLC hearings and they don&#039;t take too long and the Administrative Law Judges are very fair.

				Update on Taxi Hearing... <br /><br />So my service refusal happened way back in June 2010. My hearing was today, and although I don&#039;t know what the verdict is yet, I can say that it went smoothly. <br /><br />[I had hailed a cab back in June in midtown west; got in, closed the door, and asked to be taken to astoria- give him my address. He refused, said he&#039;d take me to 59th and Lex but not to my address. I said that wasn&#039;t fair and he then started cursing at me...I got his medallion and got out and left.]<br /><br />Anyways, the advocate for TLC was really nice and we showed using the GPS records and his fare records that the cabbie was indeed heading uptown, and had plenty of time to drop his last fare off, refuse me service, and then continue. The cabbie denied it all, said he never picked me up, doesn&#039;t know what I&#039;m talking about, etc. <br /><br />What I don&#039;t understand, forgive me for being naive, but how can someone who is <strong>sworn in</strong>&nbsp; just freaking <strong>lie </strong> like that in front of a judge... I can&#039;t fathom how that is possible. He event embellished and went on and on about how he never would ever refuse service, etc. Blah blah blah. I really hope they find in my favor because it is so obvious from the GPS records, the trip records, etc. that the guy did it. Anyways... I will repost with my verdict. I am glad I stood up for the people of outer boroughs. We can&#039;t be discriminated against! :)

				Congrats!&nbsp; I just had one a few weeks ago.&nbsp; The cab driver didn&#039;t show up to the hearing, so only my story went on the record.&nbsp; The driver got a $550 fine. I hope his story travels to other cab drivers who think they can get away with it.<br /><br />The kicker?&nbsp; When he refused to pick us up I told him we&#039;d report it.&nbsp; He said go ahead and told me his (correct) medallion number.&nbsp; I figured hey, now I am on the hook to follow through!&nbsp; Well played sir!

				I had an incident about two years back where a cabbie picked up my out-of-town parents at La Guardia and promptly turned off the meter when they gave him the Astoria destination (my apartment). My parents, not knowing any better, didn&#039;t speak up at this. He then proceeded to go in the opposite direction they requested, toward Flushing, pretending not to understand my mother asking him to go the opposite direction several times. (When she called me on her cell phone, she said she could see a giant metal globe. Um, yikes!)<br /><br />I listened to the conversation in the car as the cabbie continued to repeatedly ignore their directions to turn around. He took them down into Brooklyn and proceeded to go in circles for a bit before they finally managed to get him back up to Astoria. Mom was reading street signs to me as I followed nervously on Google maps from my apartment.&nbsp; She read off the medallion number to me in code, as I was starting to become very concerned by this point and wanted to make sure I had it if things got worse.<br /><br />Upon finally reaching my apartment, the driver asked for $45, since remember, no meter. They refused and gave him $20 (which was even then a little high for what the ride should have cost, but they wanted to get rid of him.) He argued that it wouldn&#039;t cover his gas, but at least they stood their ground on that one - it more than covered the gas for the trip they&#039;d requested in the first place.<br /><br />Since I&#039;d written down the medallion number, I talked them into reporting it. The TLC allowed my mother to testify over the phone from her out-of-state home. And her story was similar to the one above - the driver claimed it hadn&#039;t happened, but his log and GPS suggested otherwise and matched her story.<br /><br />The driver was fined and issued points. <br /><br />What it all boils down to is - points don&#039;t matter much in moderation, and the fines are small. It&#039;s when these guys get reported and get multiple points that they&#039;ll stop doing these kinds of things. They wouldn&#039;t do it if they didn&#039;t get away with it most of the time. So report them! Thanks to everyone who has. <br />

				<strong>UPDATE:</strong><br /><br />Just got my hearing verdict in the mail. They found him guilty of refusal of service and being discourteous. They fined him $150 and $200, respectively. That&#039;s a lot of money for anyone in this economy and I hope they will think twice before refusing to go a few measly paces across the QB to take a passenger home. What a stupid waste of everyone&#039;s time when a five minute cab ride could have prevented this. <br /><br />As an aside, for anyone who ever gets refused service, I would advise to use your camera phone if possible, or punch in the medallion number. All you need is the # but it also helps seemingly to have the guy&#039;s name if at all possible. Make sure you get IN the cab before stating your destination. <br /><br />

				Probably good news to almost everyone on this thread:<br /><br />http://gothamist.com/2011/02/24/higher_fines_coming_for_hacks_who_r.php<br /><br /><strong>Higher Fines Coming For Hacks Who Refuse Fares</strong><br /><br /><em>Right now a driver convicted of a refusal gets a fine of $200-$350 for their first offense, $350-500 for the second (with a possible 30-day suspension) and if they get three offenses within 36 months they flat out lose their license.<br /><br />Under a plan the TLC is proposing, which will need to be approved by the City Council, a first offense will soon cost $500 and a second will cost $750 with a 30-day suspension if it is the second offense in 24 months. The penalty for a third offense would remain the same. We think this is a great idea.</em>

				It&#039;s also a stretch that that article correlates a higher number of complaints to more fares being refused.&nbsp; <br /><br />All it really means is that more people are complaining which is not necessarily related to the # of fares being refused.

Why doesn&#039;t that surprise me? JH drivers are like ten times worse than Astorians. Once we honked at this dude for making an illegal u-turn on a double yellow lined street, holding up traffic on both sides because he had to do an eighteen point turn in his SUV. He got out of his car and spat at my car and punched the window.

				I was refused service from 58th and 2nd on Saturday night.&nbsp; The guy asked me where I was going.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t say anything and just opened the cab door to get in and then the driver moved up so I wouldn&#039;t get in.&nbsp; Luckily he wasn&#039;t able to go far because the traffic light stopped him.&nbsp; I took a pic of his license and medallion.&nbsp; He kept asking me where I was going, I said to him that he would get fined.&nbsp; I repeated it many many times.&nbsp; 1st time I&#039;ve been rejected for cab service in the 5 years I&#039;ve been living in Astoria.&nbsp; <br /><br />I got home and called 311.&nbsp; They told me that I could report it online on the TLC website I think.&nbsp; I&#039;m 100% going to the hearing when I hear back.&nbsp; The pics I took also has the date and time.&nbsp; <br /><br />By the way, I never told him where I was going and just tried to get in.&nbsp; It&#039;s illegal to even ask. (my father told me to do this) I&#039;ve never have been refused service. Usually I&#039;m in my suit so I guess that helps.&nbsp; My father drove a cab/livery for over&nbsp; 25+ years.&nbsp; I hope this guys kids have the same problem.
