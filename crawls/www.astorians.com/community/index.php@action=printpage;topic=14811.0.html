				Hello Astorians!<br /><br />This Monday I&#039;m hosting the Judith Shakespeare CO&#039;s Live music Benefit SHAKE YOUR JUDI!! judishakes.blogspot.com.<br />Monday May 4th@ Bar Nine- 9th Ave btw 53/54th st. 10-20 suggested donation..<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;JSC is a super innovative and loved staple of the off-off Broadway community and needs your help. I reach out to Astorians in particular because a lot of our donated items, that will be going to the Auction pertain to this community.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Rock (amazing gym) has kindly donated a 3 month Membership which will probably be auctioned off at 1/3 of the value. They&#039;re open 24 hours, clean, great Saunas and have tons of classes. We also have top notch donated Head shots, classical monologue work with JSC board member Jane titus, Musical theatre coaching, Aerial acrobatics, personal training, Pilates, and so on... You can also bid on the gym membership and headshots without coming to the benefit...<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We&#039;ll also have some pretty great bands playing. This Benefit is Pay what you can! I wanted to have this party accessible to ALL people, so if you can only afford 2 dollars, that&#039;s fine! I want to get the word out, because the auction items are pretty amazing, and all the proceeds are going to a great cause. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				The Rock has very generously donated a 3 month membership to a Benefit I&#039;m organizing for the Judith Shakespeare Co.<br />I love the Rock. I&#039;m pretty much a gym monkey, and have tried most gyms in the city and they&#039;re seriously my favorite. The classes are awesome and challenging, always clean, dry sauna&#039;s, tons of machines, rock climbing wall, boxing studio...but....they&#039;re not the absolute cheapest; which is why I want to put this membership out there!<br /><br />We&#039;ll be auctioning off the Membership, but since only Astorians would be interested in this particular item I wanted to reach out to the community. It&#039;s worth almost $300 but will definitely go for less----you don&#039;t have to come to the party to send your highest bid-- it may go for less than 75.00, it&#039;s tax deductible, and all proceeds go to The Judith Shakespeare co. <br /><br />All the info for the Benefit is here: judishakes.blogspot.com <br />Monday May 4th@Bar Nine 7-11:30, pay what you can!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks!!!
