				<br /><br />http://www.astorians.com/index.php?topic=5056.msg56460#msg56460<br /><br />http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0841119/<br /><br />http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0430484/<br /><br />Very glad AMMI and Tony Kaye showed the film <span class="bbc_u">Lake of Fire</span>.<br />It covers a great deal on the subject of abortion and related subjects.<br />And he seems to indicate that this showing is just the tip of the iceberg, just 1% of what he has been filming around this.<br /><br />If you are curious and interested, I would recommend seeing it. However it is long, and there are some quite graphic moments. <br />If it will not be too long before a dvd becomes available, I would prefer to see that.<br /><br />It is quite an independent film as a one man financed production, filmed and directed.<br />Carefully shot, with great intent, in black and white.

				There is some matter that I think more should see. And there are difficult scenes that would confront many viewers. I imagine pro-choice viewers might gain more from the film. It also shows why some would advocate pro-life stands. But I think it scratches issues of shades of gray and openness to consider opposing absolute values.<br /><br />(I am struck after seeing this and a different documentary, because ideology and intolerance are noted in both.)<br />If you have questions feel free to PM me.<br /><br />The director appreciates religion and belief in god, though that does not seem clear to me in the documentary. Having been raised outside of America, he may find some aspects of our society very striking and bizarre. But many Americans could agree with his sights.<br /><br />The film benefits from a bit of time perspective.<br />He started looking at this subject almost 2 decades ago, with out plans for a documentary. A lot of controversial events are covered during the 90s.<br />He said he started in this being confused. Almost 20 years later, he says he is still confused.<br /><br />The documenatry Power of Nightmares showed 3 chrnological episodes.<br /><br />Lake of Fire covers as well activists and events with radical right christians. It does not find or show much voice with more moderate christians. This aspect could have been a film in itself.<br />Some might also find that much of the discussion in the film is by men, on an issue that impacts women&#039;s bodies.<br /><br />My favorite scenes and discussions in Lake of Fire involve discussions of ethics/bioethics -<br />Nat Hentoff, Alan Dershowitz, Noam Chomsky, ...<br /><br />It also shows one person dealing with the process of choosing an abortion.<br />It shows some results after abortions.<br />And, it includes discussion with the lady involved in Roe V Wade, with her later religious conversion and pro-life work.<br />I wonder if the director has more footage covering what would be the consequences and dangers of outlawed abortions.<br /><br />The film is planned to be released late 2007; it could possibly earn nominations.<br />While such an ambitious film is unlikely to succeed in all its hopes (and I am sure the director would offer many apologies), it compares with the best of films out this year and most any year.<br />Editing down or completeness is a daunting challenge. Something this rare should not be withheld for wish of perfection.

				** I am curious how the Supreme Court decides a change of position, or whether it is just based on an evolution of political views in time. **<br /><br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Kennedy<br /><br />Abortion<br />In 1992, Kennedy joined O&#039;Connor and David Souter to form the troika who delivered the plurality opinion in the case of Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992), which re-affirmed in principle (though not in many details) the Roe v. Wade decision recognizing the right to abortion under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (Kennedy voted to uphold the restrictions on abortion at issue and considered going as far as to overturn Roe but switched that aspect of his vote during the consideration of Casey).[2] The plurality opinion, signed jointly by three justices appointed by the anti-Roe presidential administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, ignited a firestorm of criticism from conservatives. Kennedy, however, dissented in the 2000 decision of Stenberg v. Carhart, which struck down laws criminalizing partial-birth abortion.<br /><br />Gay rights<br />Kennedy has often taken a libertarian perspective in cases involving gay rights. He wrote the Court&#039;s opinion in the controversial 1996 case, Romer v. Evans, invalidating a provision in the Colorado Constitution denying homosexuals the right to bring local discrimination claims. In 2003, he authored the Court&#039;s opinion Lawrence v. Texas which invalidated criminal prohibitions against homosexual sodomy under the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution, overturning the Court&#039;s previous contrary ruling in 1986&#039;s Bowers v. Hardwick. In doing so, however, he was very careful to limit the extent of the opinion, declaring that the case did not involve whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter. In both cases, he sided with the more liberal members of the Court. Lawrence also controversially referenced international law in justifying its result. On the other hand, he voted to uphold the Boy Scouts of America&#039;s ban on gay scoutmasters in Boy Scouts of America v. Dale in 2000.<br /><br />Capital punishment<br />Kennedy has generally voted to restrict the use of the death penalty. With the Court&#039;s majority in Atkins v. Virginia and Roper v. Simmons he held unconstitutional the execution of the mentally ill and those under 18 at the time of the crime. However in Kansas v. Marsh, he declined to join the dissent, which questioned the overall &quot;soundness&quot; of the existing capital punishment system. His opinion for the Court in Roper, as in Lawrence, made extensive reference to international law, drawing the ire of then-House Majority Leader Tom DeLay who called Kennedy&#039;s opinion &quot;incredibly outrageous&quot; but stopped short of calling for his impeachment.<br />

				http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/06pdf/05-380.pdf<br /><br />The details seem a little confusing to me so far.<br />And I am very curious to look at Ginsburg&#039;s writing of the dissenting opinion.<br /><br />At quick glance, while the Court affirmed the legal restrictions, it appears that for the most part Roe V Wade and Choice stands with even more support than I would have expected.<br /><br />&nbsp;:?

				No, the ruling was a blow against the legality of abortions. The times has an editorial on it today. Really upsetting. http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/19/opinion/19thu1.html?em&amp;ex=1177214400&amp;en=44ae1e2461a995b5&amp;ei=5087%0A<br /><br />I find it upsetting, and as a mother, terrifying that the right to choose may be denied someday to my daughter. Without abortion, I would have given birth to a child I didn&#039;t want, with a man I didn&#039;t love, and never met my husband or had the children I do want very much. <br /><br />Anyway, if you wish to contribute to the legal battle against this ruling, planned parenthood is always a great choice.

				I&#039;ve done a lot of work for Planned Parenthood Federation (PPFA) and still have friends who work there. I can tell you that they are freaking over this recent ruling. But, then, they&#039;ve been freaking ever since Harriet Meirs was nominated and Roberts was subsequently confirmed. It is NOT a &quot;special circumstances&quot; ruling, as conservatives would like everyone to believe. It is part of a &quot;chipping away&quot; strategy that has been in place since before Roberts was confirmed. Conservatives conceded that they can never overturn Roe v. Wade without provoking riots, so instead they adopted a strategy that will attempt to create a set of laws and restrictions that will effectively render Roe v. Wade moot--basically making it virtually impossible to obtain an abortion while leaving Roe intcact. This ruling is one more step in that direction. And introducing marketing terminology like &quot;partial-birth&quot; is part of their strategy as well. The word &quot;birth&quot; insinuates life. Partial-life abortion. It&#039;s not hard for the populous to oppose that. Though it&#039;s (not) funny how they NEVER consider the life of the woman. Indeed the Supreme Court considers women as mere vessels...

				&quot;Anyway, if you wish to contribute to the legal battle against this ruling, planned parenthood is always a great choice. Link below: &quot;<br />http://www.plannedparenthood.org/<br /><br /><br /><br />&quot;Instead, they ratified the politically based and dangerously dubious&quot; <strong>Congressional </strong> &quot;claim that criminalizing the intact dilation and extraction method of abortion in the second trimester of pregnancy — the so-called partial-birth method — would&quot; <strong>never </strong> &quot;pose a significant health risk to a woman. In fact, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has found the procedure to be medically necessary in certain cases.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;It comes at a real cost to the court’s credibility, its integrity and the rule of law.&quot;<br /><br />http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/abortion/2003s3.html<br />(b) SENSE OF THE SENATE. --It is the sense of theSenate that --<br /><strong>(1) the decision of the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade (410 U.S. 113 (1973)) was appropriate and secures an important constitutional right; and <br />(2) such decision should not be overturned.</strong><br />Passed the Senate March 13, 2003.<br /><br /><br />***<br />Is it correct that this ban does not affect 99.9% of abortion cases, that it uphelds the decision of Roe v Wade?<br /><br />That it passed with support of some key Democratic Senate leaders?<br /><br />I consider it true that this opens a very slippery slope. It takes medical decisions out of the hands of patients, women, doctors and puts it up to politicians. What if every 2 years Congress made a different decision regarding this practice?<br /><br /><br /><br />(NY Times? does not speak for most voters, but they do seem to be improving.)

				I think of it in terms of the <em>precedent</em> it sets. There&#039;s always a new case (partial-birth) that comes before the court that digs up old precedents and tries to make a case for being an exception to the rule. Roe is considered to be a precedent and is frequently referred back to in new cases, but even precedents have been overturned when their position on a new case is unclear. Those exceptions can then become law. And so on. This can get so confusing.&nbsp; :|
