				hello all....<br /><br />first of all--- i&#39;m pretty ignorant when it comes to tax stuff and money in general.<br /><br />i just got my first W2&#39;s from my employer and this means all the other stuff should come dropping in soon.<br /><br />i&#39;ve been getting my taxes done at Jackson Hewitt for the past 2 years, but.... i want to go elsewhere. <br /><br />how much does tax preparation for a single person cost? <br />do any of you out there recommend tax preparers in the area? <br /><br />any feedback, comments, etc, are welcomed.<br /><br />thanks in advance!<br /><br />

				when i price around it always seems ridiculous. last year i had huge drama b/c my company underwithheld me(had me down as married&nbsp; :x)so my mom had her guy do it, and i still owe her $125! HRBlock i think was around $80, which in my opinion is too high for the EZ form. I have to do the long form soley for my student loan interest, med bills(insurance doesn&#39;t cover my one rx, which is $122)and i think for my credit card settlement. I am a retard when it comes to math(2 out of 3 NY state math regents were passed by 2-5 points)but when i did my taxes myself the few years prior to the last one that was all screwed up, i got myself a nice little refund. but if you have all sorts of deductions then yeah you need a pro so you get your green :lol:<br /><br />Good Luck, and if you find someone who doesn&#39;t charge too much for a simple tax return, by all means tell us mathmatically challenged souls!<br />Jenn

				I use Turbo Tax (http://www.turbotax.com) ($19.95 Federal).Â  No math involved, you just plug in the info and it does the work.<br /><br />People filing 1040EZ can file free (http://www.irs.ustreas.gov/efile/article/0,,id=118986,00.html).

				For the past twelve years, I have been getting my taxes done by James Demetriou. His office is located at 34-03 Broadway in Astoria. I am totally satisfied with the job he&#39;s done for me. I used to do my own taxes until I bought my house in Long Island City, and figured I should have some expert advice. That&#39;s when I started going to him. He&#39;s never failed to get me every tax benefit that was coming to me.<br />When I first started seeing him. the fee was $50. Through the years, it&#39;s gone up like it has everywhere else. But even so, last year I was charged less than $100 ($90, if I remember correctly). Let&#39;s see what I&#39;m charged *this* year.&nbsp; :-)<br />In short, if you&#39;re looking for an excellent tax preparer in the neighborhood, I certainly recommend him because of the good experiences I&#39;ve had. Plus, he&#39;s a very pleasant, well informed guy to talk to if you have any concerns about your taxes.
