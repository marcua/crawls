				Glad to see the man retire, but Gianaris as a replacement? I thought the whole point of &quot;throw the bums out of Albany&quot; was to throw the bums out, not to promote them to higher offices.

				I am incredibly delighted to see Assemblymember Mike Gianaris step up for the State Senate seat.&nbsp; He is an amazing leader and will make us proud.&nbsp; He voted for marriage equality three times and has been a leader on the environment and combating noise pollution.&nbsp; He will be a very strong voice for us.<br /><br />The field for the soon-to-be-vacated Assembly seat is unclear as yet.

				I heard that Costa Constantinides, an Astoria Activist, is considering running for the open Assembly Seat. I don&#039;t know if he has made his decision yet, but he definetely would make a great assemblyman. Costa is a Democratic District Leader. He also was the chair of the Coalition for a Better Astoria, the group that fought to stop Fed Ex from moving their facilities to our neighborhood. Costa is also Vice President of the Long Island City Alliance, a civic group that is fighting for responsible development and to put an end to overdevelopment. Costa has done much more, but I would have to type for days if I wrote it all on this thread. Astoria needs new leadership in Albany, and Costa could be the fresh face we need.

				My guess - and I am not endorsing this, it is just a guess- is Paul Vallone, Peter Vallone Jr&#039;s brother.&nbsp; He recently lost in the Democratic primary for Tony Avella&#039;s city council seat in Bayside/Flushing/College Point.&nbsp; His residence is in Flushing but he also claims a residence - or at least has claimed a residence - in Astoria http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2009/07/16/2009-07-16_city_council_candidate_peter_vallone_voted_in_two_districts_but_had_single_aim__.html (http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2009/07/16/2009-07-16_city_council_candidate_peter_vallone_voted_in_two_districts_but_had_single_aim__.html)<br /><br />I am sure he could raise money quickly, thanks to his father and brother and has name recognition.&nbsp;
