				Astorians are always looking for recommendations for a great cleaning person so I thought I would share.&nbsp; I have had the pleasure of having Mercedes clean my apartment for several years now.&nbsp; I have tried many people over the years and Mercedes has out-shined all of them.&nbsp; She is reliable, trustworthy and simply excellent at cleaning and organizing your place.&nbsp; She has an excellent attention to detail and I would recommend her to anyone without hesitation.&nbsp; Anyone I have ever referred her to has been very happy with her work.<br /><br /><br />Mercedes can be reached at 516-270-5903.
