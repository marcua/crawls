				I would recommend making the trek to Trader Joe&#039;s.&nbsp; They have the best prices - substantially lower than anything I&#039;ve seen in Astoria.&nbsp; That being said, if you come across a ~16oz jar of the stuff locally, please share the info!&nbsp; :)

				I didn&#039;t mention a specific location because I&#039;ve seen it in more than one Key Food.&nbsp; I think they all carry it, in the organic section.<br /><br />At the Key Food near Ditmars on 31st St., it is in the organic section that is across from the milk/yogurt in the first aisle.

				Hmm, I never had a problem finding almond butter (love that stuff); the problem is finding it for less than $10/jar. Generally found in the organic section.<br /><br />Fairway has it for around $6, but that&#039;s only handy if you&#039;re up on the west side. There&#039;s also an organic store on Broadway near the subway station that should carry it.

				I love almond butter!&nbsp; I have never made it, but I have read in recipes that specify almond flour, that they warn not to grind up the almonds too far because they will turn into almond butter!&nbsp; I&#039;d recommend just trying it with a small amount and seeing what happens!&nbsp; If anything, you&#039;ll have almond flour which is wonderful stuff.&nbsp; <br /><br />Here&#039;s a random recipe for almond butter (http://www.rwood.com/Recipes/Homemade_Almond_Butter.htm).&nbsp; You might do a search and see if you find one that is more to your liking.&nbsp; Sounds like it could be a really fun project, too!

				Try making it yourself!&nbsp; You can grind them in a food processor, mini chopper or even a spice grinder/coffee grinder.&nbsp; Grind them raw, or dry-roasted, or toast them yourself in the oven before grinding, with or without salt.

				Whether you add oil depends on the consistency you&#039;re looking for.&nbsp; I don&#039;t add oil.&nbsp; I also make cashew butter, sunflower butter....&nbsp; I just purchase the nuts or seeds raw/blanched/unsalted and grind them, adding salt to taste.&nbsp; I like making it myself because I can make a very small amount at a time.&nbsp; Experiment!

				Oh I loooooove making my own almond butter.&nbsp; The trick is, you have to grind it long enough for it to become almond butter without killing your food processor.&nbsp; Ha.&nbsp; I have a handheld, so I usually have to do about 3 different times, and let it cool off in between.&nbsp; Then I add ground flax seed, cinnamon, and ginger.&nbsp; Yum, heaven.&nbsp; <br />PS - I find that Whole Foods has the best prices for pre-made almond butter, though it&#039;s not close to Astoria, unfortunately.

				I go to Trader Joe&#039;s for mine.. I teach music every Tuesday in Brooklyn Hts and just walk down there to pick up a bag or two of groceries (I find that spot during the week so much better to go to than the zoo in Union Sq).
