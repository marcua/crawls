				McCain does not want a war.&nbsp; Do you think it&#039;s easy to get out of Iraq?&nbsp; &nbsp;Obama won&#039;t be able to do it any faster than McCain, unless he allows a slaughter to take place.&nbsp; We should have not stayed as soon as we saw no weopons, but that was Bush effing up.&nbsp; &nbsp; We have guys there now, and a commitment has been made.&nbsp; If troops start getting pulled,&nbsp; &nbsp; last guys waiting to get out will be dead ducks, as will anyone there among citizens who were anti-Hussain.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				McCain was for going into Iraq right after 9/11, before there was any evidence on whether or not there were WMDs in Iraq. Too many military leaders have aligned themselves with the military industrial complex and are unable to stand back and look at things objectively, which is why the president is the commander in chief makes the decisions. Obama is a much more objective person who is able to weigh all options before making a decision regarding troops in Iraq, Afghanistan, and if a new crisis arises, whether it makes sense to take the country into another military action. McCain shoots from the hip, and thinks later. He&#039;s just as much a warmonger as Bush, perhaps even more so. <br /><br /><em>Generals and Majors ah ah<br />they&#039;re never too far<br />from battlefields so glorious<br />out in a world of their own<br />They&#039;ll never come down<br />till once again victorious<br />Generals and Majors always<br />seem so unhappy &#039;less they got a war<br /><br />Generals and Majors ah ah<br />like never before are tired of being actionless.<br /><br />Calling<br />Generals and Majors everywhere<br />Calling<br />your World War III is drawing near<br /><br />Generals and Majors ah ah<br />They&#039;re never too far <br />away from men who made the grade<br />out in a world of their own<br />They&#039;ll never come down<br />until the battle&#039;s lost or made<br /><br />Generals and Majors ah ah<br />like never before, are tired of being in the shade. </em> <br /><br />by - Colin Moulding of XTC

				No one has said how Obama will get troops out. They are there, like it or not.&nbsp; &nbsp;Getting them out now is extremely tough, maybe impossible. Obama Say&#039;s he&#039;s bringing&nbsp; them home right away.&nbsp; &nbsp;There will be a slaughter if they are pulled out too fast.&nbsp; &nbsp; Seems only answer people have is to atack McCain.&nbsp; I don&#039;t like McCain, but Obama is just as bad, maybe worse.&nbsp; What way is he bringing&nbsp; troops home?&nbsp; &nbsp;All in one day?&nbsp; If govt. there is not stable, and armed people are looing to kill us, when troop level gets to close to 50% a slaughter will start.&nbsp; Will he send guys back in?&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />If he has stated a plan, I&#039;d like to hear it.&nbsp;

				If Obama laid out a specific plan this far in advance, McCain would tear it apart and then criticize him for letting the terrorists know his plan. But this is the Iraq section on his website, if that offers any insight: http://www.barackobama.com/issues/iraq/
