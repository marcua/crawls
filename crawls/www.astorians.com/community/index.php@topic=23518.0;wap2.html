			Hey folks,<br /><br />It&#039;s been a while since I strolled these streets but with the election in full BS throttle, I&#039;ve been finding myself more and more disappointed with the whole process.<br /><br />Early this morning on a run through Astoria Park I saw a &quot;Jill Stein for President&quot; sticker on a pole. Not sure the party would approve but it seems there may be a renegade Green somewhere out there.<br /><br />Got me wondering if there are any Greens (as in, Green Party members/supporters) in Astoria willing to get together regularly to talk, debate, and generally work on actually making the world a better place.<br /><br />If so, let me know. I&#039;d like to get a regular group together.<br /><br />I&#039;ve emailed and Facebooked the West Queens Greens but have heard nothing back so I figured I&#039;d start from scratch.<br /><br />-c-<br />
