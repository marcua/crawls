				I am starting up this blog (http://missolibrary.blogspot.com) to help make my elementary school library in Astoria an exciting and fun reading place! <br /><br />I am currently having a reading challenge with donorschoose.com. Donorschoose allows teachers to create a blog challenge to get individuals to donate $10 to help fund a project for elementary school kids.&nbsp; Think about each child getting a copy of Charlotte&#39;s Web or building and flying a kite in Astoria Park.<br /><br />If every astorian donates a few dollars I can reach my $3000 goal before the start of this school year($10 minimum). It will be ongoing all year.&nbsp; This money will allow me to get new books and invite storytellers and musicians to my library. <br /><br />Check it out!&nbsp; (Five donations to date&nbsp; :-D)!<br /><br />http://missolibrary.blogspot.com/ <br /><br />Just Click to make a donation!<br />Thank you in advance! <br /><div align="center">(http://astorians.com/Themes/default/images/warnwarn.gif)<br />&nbsp;Multiple messages, soliciting, wrong categories.</div>
