				I've <strong>had</strong> it! [See Me: going off sulking into the void ..Boo_Hoo! &lt;cry&gt;]<br /><br />[Later...] Jesus, what was I thinking? Although the video still disturbs me (and that greatly) that's still no excuse to lash out like that (a common habit or so I am told). If I'm not speaking to the wind (which is highly probable now) then I guess I should promptly admit when I'm wrong... which I am, fwiw. It will still take a few years (if ever) to get that footage out of my head however. In contradistinction to what I stated earlier, I don't recommend that anyone watch it, unless you enjoy being traumatized of course.<br /><br />Cheers.

				I watched it. I think &quot;genocide&quot; is a bit of an overstatement. Unless you consider all random acts of violence genocide.<br /><br />Very disturbing none the less. But I think we need to be cautious, rational, and deliberate when we make claims or accept information coming from the media. <br /><br />It's difficult to see exactly what is going on here at all other than that shots are being fired at what appear to be totally innocent people. Not that this isn't significant, but this happens on the streets of L.A. every day and we seldom &quot;spam&quot; boards in an attempt to elicit a reactive response.<br /><br />Apology accepted :)

				Please also read the attendant article. These people that are getting shot are quite real and there is an investigation being conducted by the Foreign Office.

You can see them veering off the road or crashing. You can see the windshield taking bullet impact. More disturbing (yet speculative) is the way that the video is suddenly shut off or edited once some of the people get out of the car. What happened then? IMO, all of this is s.o.p. which makes it even more disturbing. Do you think this is a fake? I admit the possibility...nay I <em>hope</em> to God it is staged.<br /><br />Holocausts &quot;just happen&quot;. They need to be prevented. I am sure that when &quot;only&quot; tens of thousands of Jews were being killed that people crying genocide were similarly dismissed.

				no doubt that these are war crimes and that the people in the video who took advantage of the lawlessness of post-Hussein iraq should be tried as war criminals. &nbsp;but the only thing this video produces is a good argument to not use any security contractors when there is a full scale war.<br /><br />there hasn't been a single war in the history of mankind dating back to the king of Qin in china, to genghis khan, to the romans conquering the greeks where war crimes have not happened. &nbsp;does this video really meaningfully connect to and invalidate the legitimacy of the iraq invasion?

				Title: <strong>On the legitimacy of invading Iraq</strong><br />
				Post by: <strong>zeno</strong> on <strong>December 02, 2005, 12:37:07 AM</strong>
			</dt>
			<dd class="postbody">
				@Jcy: I believe that you are right in questioning the meaningful relation of this footage and these crimes to the legitimacy of the invasion of Iraq... but first let me address the private contracting issue (which we already happen to agree upon).<br /><br />Our reliance on private contractors IMO is just another indicator of how ill-planned and expensive this extended occupation and invasion is, regardless if the war is ethical or not. It may also indicate a lack of popular support, and without the popular support of American citizens and volunteer soldiers whose hearts may not be into this war, we can hardly be labeled a Democracy... which is besides the point.<br /><br />These contractors are unaccountable to anyone (except perhaps their employer) and I am not sure if UCMJ or the Geneva convention applies to them. The report by Rayment stated that Aegis was conducting an investigation in conjunction with the Foreign Office. It may be rhetorical but, what kind of investigation is carried out by the accused themselves?<br /><br />When questioning the legitimacy of the Iraq War then we must question the motives behind the invasion. I think that there is a consensus that Sadam is no longer a threat and the reports of illusory WMDs was a bit contrived if not an outright lie. If the war is about geopolitical positioning or even about money to be made from oil, then I wish that the Administration had been a little more honest about the real plan behind invasion... which was planned long in advance.<br /><br />The argument now is that by occupying Iraq we are preventing it from falling into further anarchy... the same argument the British gave before pulling out of colonial India, by the way.<br /><br />How this relates to the video/snuff flick? Well, the video clearly shows that our presence in Iraq is doing anything but promoting stability. Be it reminded that this incident is not an isolated one. My contention is that it (the occupation) is promoting quite the opposite, exacerbating the situation in fact. We mustn't forget that Iraq under Sadam was relatively stable. We are not the cure of the problem in Iraq. We are the <em>cause</em> of the problem.<br /><br />If the war is about global domination or even Middle Eastern domination then yes... the war is legitimate. If the war is about spreading democracy, helping the Iraqi people or preventing a possible Kurdish genocide then I say no, these are all lame excuses for a hypocritical and unjust war, which is centered around the enormous profits and gains in power for a few individuals. &nbsp;(In the United States power should belong to the people... I don't mean to sound <em>quaint</em> I really believe that in this case We are the Oppressor. There are other ways besides extended occupation in order to prevent a possible Kurdish genocide. Remember the words of George Bush when he said that &quot;We are going to war to protect the peace&quot;? How far is this removed from the argument that we are committing genocide in order to prevent genocide. Many, many people that I have talked to about this (by no means a minority have confided in me that &quot;pressing the button&quot; iow nuclear holocaust was probably the best solution... perhaps<br />the Final Solution.<br /><br />And my question is...my fear is... that we are not that far away <em>from</em> such a genocide.<br /><br />Thank you for responding Merm and Jcy... it is nice to know that there are individuals out there who actually care about people and don't automatically turn a blind eye to crimes of this magnitude just because the truth is unpleasant. While before I was freaking out, now I don't feel so alone... and that's what communities are about, aren't they?

				I wouldn't say that I think these videos are a fake. But I remember seeing a few years ago a video of something similar going on here in the U.S. A group of kids went out on a drive-by-shooting rampage with a video camera. The reality is that this happens all the time in the world, and it indeed is sad and disturbing in the extreme.<br /><br />However, where I'm more cautious is making the link between these incidents, and politics. The truth is that these things happen all the time, all around us, in the United States and in other countires as well. Just because it was caught on film in Iraq may or may not mean that things have gotten worse, or that they are getting better, or what something needs to be done any more than something needs to be done about this happening in general in the world. We need to be careful about how we apply this to politics, let us not forget that it's the very reaction to videos like this that make us go to war in the first place. (at least this kind of thing was the very reason we are supposedly in Iraq. To save the Iraquis from barbaric violence at the hands of extremists.) The reality is to use this video to argue that we shouldn't be there, is the same as to use the video to say that we should be there. In either case our politics are informed by an emotional reaction - and in either case parties are supposedly acting in the &quot;interest&quot; of the Iraqi people. Just like they are acting in our interest by responding to 9/11 by putting more police in the subways. People legitimately believe this is the best reaction.<br /><br />I myself am in support of slow reaction, and careful evaluation, and restrained politics. The reality is that we live in a world where people are killed every day, despite their title or nationality. This is the reality of a world of over 6 billion people. We can't change that over night, it's going to take a long slow sustained, rational, effort by those of us that believe that society can do better.<br /><br />This doesn't make killing ok by any means. I'm just giving one rationale for why after watching that video I'm not suddenly motivated to elevated emotion; to be that way would be to blind myself to the injustices that happen in the world (and my own neighborhood) on a daily basis.<br /><br />This might not make any sense but I'm trying :)

				first, this video neither proves or disproves that our presence in iraq is just or unjust. &nbsp;to interpret and to then extend the recklessness and lawlessness of the contractors to defame the rest of the armed forces is absolutely wrong. &nbsp;a conquered nation is not stable. &nbsp;this is inevitable, and by itself not reason enough to invalidate our presence there.<br /><br />then:<br /><br />&quot;we can hardly be labeled a Democracy&quot;<br /><br />this is right. &nbsp;we're a republic, big difference.<br /><br />also one could take issue with this:<br /><br />&quot;We mustn't forget that Iraq under Sadam was relatively stable.&quot;<br /><br />it would be tedious to recount all the horrors and torture perpetrated by hussein upon his own people and the kurds. &nbsp;nor that hussein desperately wanted to conquer iran and kuwait.<br /><br />also, the repetition of the word &quot;genocide&quot; is completely misapplied and hysterical. &nbsp;no one is rounding up the iraqi women and children and putting them to death in an orderly fashion.<br /><br />there are reasons one might object to the iraqi war. &nbsp;this video isn't relevant to any of them, unless it's a side debate regarding the use of contractors and/or tenable oversight by the armed forces of the contractors.

				@jcy: I stand corrected on all points.<br /><br />I also understand that my use of the word 'genocide' is misapplied and hysterical. In this case I am only in fear of &quot;possibilities&quot; which may or may not come to pass, which I suppose is neither here nor there. In fact when I posed the possibilty of genocide in Iraq to an actual eye-witness to the events there, he assured me that my fears were groundless.<br /><br />Also, in my defence, my use of the word &quot;Democracy&quot; was more rhetorical in nature, pointing to an ideal rather; and am well aware that technically we are living in a Federalistic Republic. My bad for my fallacious &nbsp;<em>appeal to emotion</em>.<br /><br />Let's just say that I was (appropriately or not) very disturbed by the video... and saw it (unprovably so) as an indicator of standard operating procedure (on the part of the contractors), which (from the same friend) assured me that this was so.<br /><br />Again, I stand corrected on all points.<br /><br />----

				My point was more theoretical in nature.<br /><br />I.E. Planes slam into buildings and we are all moved to great emotion and highly disturbed. Then this emotion is channeled into an interpretation of those events that is entirely not true. In this process (of jumping to a hasty conclusion about what happened) we soon invade two countries, and change laws in our own country to combat the tyranny.<br /><br />I would have preferred a slower and more rational approach on the part of all Americans (including myself - but I am learning my lesson.)<br /><br />So, using 9/11 as my backdrop, I'm suggesting that seeing something on TV (or the internet) through the lens of a video camera is limiting. And takes special care as to how to respond or react. If we are to help propell mankind into an enlightened era, we must stop acting like our enemy. We must stop being reactive, emotional, fearful, etc. All these things falsely legitimize behavior that only continues the cycle of violence, although it may &quot;appear&quot; that it works in the short term.<br /><br />These times call for patience, careful scrutiny, and a centered soul that is at peace with itself.

			<dd class="postbody">
				Point well taken Merm and I also started a topic called &quot;Emotions&quot; which (I hope) will seek to invite logic instead of passion while at the same time recognizing the &quot;intelligence&quot; of emotions, which may (or may not) have been the &quot;birth of conscience&quot;.<br /><br />I reacted to the video on an instinctual level. I demanded immediate action. I may or may not have used the same tools of the &quot;enemy&quot;. Can the English alphabet also be considered a tool? If all speech is political then is it best to maintain silence?<br /><br />But in my defense, my call to action was different from that of the opposition... and different fundamentally.<br />My idea of action was in fact inaction...iow... stop the killing, withdraw from Iraq, recognize that war entails war crimes (maybe on a massive scale...maybe not). In other words my call, my message was &quot;End the Cycle of Violence&quot;. Never once did I call for punishment, for war.<br /><br />I never said: (<em>statement</em>) &quot;Go to war to protect the peace.&quot; Fallacy<br />I said: (<em>statement</em>) &quot;Stop the war to end the killing.&quot; Truism<br /><br />When I refer to killing I mean killing on our behalf, I mean funding the occupation, funding the contract killers, I mean pulling Britain into the mix. We must ask the Iraqi people and the international community to help &quot;restore&quot; order. I believe our presence is exacerbating the situation. We are not preventing civil war...Civil War is raging... and We are the <em>direct</em> cause, unintentionally or not. From helping Sadam consolidate power via funding and weapons (although perhaps well intentioned) till now, full scale invasion and occupation... perhaps colonization.<br />Please tell me it's about freedom and not the oil.<br />Please tell me it's about democracy and not geoplitical positioning,<br />or money to be made from rebuilding after first demolishing.<br />Tell me that our presence is sincere and just...<br />I just may believe you.<br /><br />Evidence? One video? No... there is information out there... alot of it in fact that shows the true state of Iraq... what our efforts may or may not have &nbsp;brought. There is footage, there are photos and there is &quot;spin&quot; on both sides. There are soldiers who periodically come home. Ask them... get to the truth. I am willing to accept the fact that we belong there if enough eye-wintesses convince me that it is so. When I say &quot;I&quot;, I mean all those who are for immediate withdrawal. I am not yet convinced. Everyone that I've talked to so far has told me that over there is F----d. I am seeking out veterans to tell me otherwise. Perhaps I have not talked to enough.<br /><br />And concerning the solitary video? Why don't we ask the shooters why they were doing what they did? &nbsp;Unless, of course the video was spurious. Perhaps they had good reason, just like the Marine who shot an unarmed Iraqi in a mosque in Fallujah not so long ago... what was his name?<br /><br />My idea of Action is <em>appealing</em>, <em>pleading</em> to the international community under the direction of the people of Iraq (including the minorities) to help rebuild this devastated nation.<br /><br />How am I similar to my &quot;enemy&quot;?<br />Maybe my naivete is one thing that makes us different.<br /><br />I also believe in patience. Perhaps in another ten years or so when the body count rises to something like 100,000 we will be ready to make up our minds.<br /><br />@merm: I value our frienship dearly, but on this question: immediate withdrawal or not, we may never see eye-to-eye. My conviction remains firm... based on irrational emotion as it may be. In my eyes you're still one of the greatest human beings I have ever known &nbsp;:-) !<br /><br />Let's keep this discussion going. And thanks again jcy for pointing out my fallacious reasoning.<br /><br />http://www.iraqbodycount.org/
