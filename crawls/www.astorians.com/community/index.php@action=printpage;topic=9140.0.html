				Both Debbie and I were there, there may have been others.<br />They had great turnout from the agencies, and Assemblymember Gianaris, Councilmember Peter Vallone, Jr. and Senator George Onorato were on stage prompting agencies to give more information and taking the microphone at times.&nbsp; Nothing huge seemed to be discussed, but many concerns were raised by individuals.&nbsp; It was, as always, helpful.

				They do the forums pretty regularly, once or twice a year I think.&nbsp; Rosemary Povoromo, who is the head of the United Community Civic Association, which co-convenes the forums with Assemblymember Mike Gianaris, gets all the agencies there - I mean, I&#039;m incredibly impressed.&nbsp; I worked in city government for seven years in Manhattan and never saw anything like it - we never got so many agencies to send a representative for three solid hours, and she gets solid responses and has them give out their cards.&nbsp; She runs a tight meeting, though a few people asking questions went off on bizarre tangents.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure the next forum will get posted and we&#039;ll try to bump it up a bit the day before so more folks come out.

				I tried to get them to respond to some quality of life questions / issues but as usual, the lip service took over.<br />Not enough cops blah blah blah - the cops have time to lie in wait for people parking in certain areas to forget to look at the signs&nbsp; but they will never give out a ticket for littering.
