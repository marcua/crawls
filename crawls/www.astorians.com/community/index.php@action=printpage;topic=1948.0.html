				The gal and I are looking to move, the lease is up in June and we&#39;ve decided to start looking early.<br /><br />Right now we live at 35th ave and 29th street, in a large basement apartment.&nbsp; It gets rather cold in the winter (we pay our own heat), and the rent is a mite expensive.<br /><br />We saw a place today that was at 38th ave and 23rd street in Ditmars.&nbsp; Nice space, cheap-fixer-upper...but...<br /><br />It feels a bit isolated.<br /><br />Give it to me straight, Astorians....would any of you come to visit us?&nbsp; It&#39;s a 7 block walk from the station.<br /><br />Does anyone live around there?&nbsp; Any encouraging (or discouraging) words to impart?<br /><br />It&#39;s a tough decision...<br /><br />Thanks, all!<br /><br />-T<br /><br />

				I&#39;m confused...<br />Where is the new place located?&nbsp; 38th Ave is WAY south of Ditmars.&nbsp; Do you mean 38th Street at 23rd Ave?&nbsp; If so, it&#39;s nice over there.&nbsp; Lots of good food and other things.

				Yikes!&nbsp; It was on 38th street, between 23rd and 24th ave.<br /><br />Closer to 23rd.<br /><br />Sorry &#39;bout that, I can get a bit numbers dyslexic!<br /><br />The big problem we&#39;ve seen is that there doesn&#39;t seem to be a laundry nearby.<br /><br />But it is a fairly quick walk to Ditmars Blvd.<br /><br />

				I lived on 38th st and Ditmars for 3 yrs, never had any problems.&nbsp; And it&#39;s only a 6 minute walk to the subway, especially if you go up 23rd and cut thru the Key Food parking lot (on 33rd?).&nbsp; The alley leads you right into the subway stairs.&nbsp; There&#39;s great food on Ditmars and 30th Ave, both of which you will be close to.&nbsp; Don&#39;t know about laundry but I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find something.&nbsp; All the grocery stores deliver too.&nbsp; The fruit stand on Ditmars and 38th is great.&nbsp; &nbsp; And you&#39;re within 15 mins walking distance from the NYSC.&nbsp; &nbsp;The walk up 37th St. to nysc is beautiful between astoria blvd and 28th ave.&nbsp; Good luck!

				I live on 37th Street between 24th and 23rd Avenues and I love where I live!&nbsp; It&#39;s a 5-6 minute walk to either Astoira Blvd or Ditmars subway stop.&nbsp; And this location puts you between both the Greek/Ditmars nabe and the arab section of Steinway Street; I&#39;m a 5 minute walk to Kabab Cafe, which is totally awesome.&nbsp; You&#39;ll be near the Greek Monastery which has bells that I am in love with.&nbsp; I wish I was closer so that I could hear them more often.&nbsp; You&#39;re an easy walk to Ditmars, and a mile from Astoria Park.&nbsp; There&#39;s a laundromat at 37th Street and 24th Ave, an easy walk with your laundry in a granny cart.&nbsp; I know there are places nearby that you can drop off, too.&nbsp; And you&#39;re a couple blocks from that Christos Taverna which has The Steaks. <br /><br />All in all, a great part of Astoria to live in.

				Also, if you drive, it&#39;s a good location.&nbsp; Easy access to the Grand Central, the BQE, and getting over the Triboro.&nbsp; There&#39;s also a bodega on 37th St. and 24th Ave., the &quot;Exective Deli.&quot;&nbsp; No, I did not spell that incorrectly.&nbsp; It&#39;s a sad awning with that misspelling.<br /><br />OOOh, I forgot you are close to San Antonio Bakery #2, too!&nbsp; Mmmmm...chilean hot dogs....pan cake....lomito....PEBRE!!!!!!!

The sketchy alley! Flooz and I were just talking about this recently, and Jtrane too. It&#39;s not behind the Key foods, though -- it&#39;s a little further down by the big train bridge where the really friendly homeless guy lives. Ah.. I miss that area.

				Used to live on Steinway between Ditmars and 23rd Ave. I think that 38th would have been better, though, considering that Steinway is a major street and a lot of trucks drive past. 38th is definitely more quiet.<br /><br />As for laundry - I would suggest House of Suds on around 41st (?) on Ditmars. The people are nice, and the machines work well.<br /><br />I also give a huge thumbs up to the veggie store that&#39;s next to Trade Fair. They have wonderful deals on vegetables - esp. in the summer. You can get awesome artichokes there for really cheap in the summer. Trade Fair is a little less desireable of a grocery store because of their size. They do have some interesting products though. I used to buy babaganoush in a can there all the time and loved it (of course, adding my own lemon, salt, and fresh garlic!).<br /><br />The walk is not fantastic, especially in the winter, but it really isn&#39;t all that bad. You&#39;ll get used to it. The days that it sucks the most is when it is either really really cold, really really hot, or when you&#39;re carrying a crapload of stuff all the way from the subway. There is a bus that does run up Ditmars, though, so some days that can be helpful.<br /><br />Good luck!

				I live off of 23rd ave and 38th street, good nieghborhood.&nbsp; Especially this time of year, you won&#39;t even notice the walk (just be careful under the bird s___ bridge!).&nbsp; Kumos sushi is just around the corner, or grab Bankok Tasty Thai food&nbsp; by the subway on your way home.&nbsp; I could go on and on, I love living in this area.&nbsp;

				I grew up on Steinway st and 25th Ave right next to electrolux and the Kabab place. I moved from there in 1996 because the noise on Steinway st was just too much, but there are alot of things to do on Steinway and Ditmars is also a very nice area to go to with alot of stores.

				Thanks to ALL of you who posted!&nbsp; You really livened the potential &#39;hood up for us, but sadly we decided not to take the place.<br /><br />It was a bit too dingy, and needed a bit too much work to get it up to &quot;dream apartment&quot; status.<br /><br />We&#39;re still looking (trying to grab a place more toward 30th ave), and we&#39;re definitely staying in Astoria.<br /><br />Thanks, all!<br /><br />-Tim
