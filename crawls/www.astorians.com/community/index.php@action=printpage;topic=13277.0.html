				Maybe someone out there can help a guy from the 80s who is more at home with records, tapes and CDs!<br /><br />We made the leap to an iPod about 2 years ago.&nbsp; I successfully downloaded all the music we wanted to keep forever from our CDs.&nbsp; Then gave away the CDs.&nbsp; (I know - but I do things like this all the way, or not at all).&nbsp; So my iTunes library contained all the music as does the iPod.&nbsp; Since then we purchased new music via iTunes as well.&nbsp; In addition, a friend of mine downloaded the music files to a DVD that I keep in the apartment.<br /><br />Since then, the hard drive on my laptop burned up.&nbsp; The laptop is nonfunctional.&nbsp; The same friend thinks he might be able to salvage data from it.&nbsp; But no guarantees.&nbsp; And maybe he can move files we downloaded to the disc into a new iTunes library.&nbsp; But again, they may or may not be accepted.<br /><br />I bought a new laptop and downloaded iTunes.&nbsp; I plug in my iPod which contains all my music.&nbsp; I carefully select NOT to sync the iPod.&nbsp; So it shows my iPod&#039;s music library when it&#039;s plugged in.&nbsp; But I cannot migrate the music from the iPod into the new, empty iTunes library.<br /><br />What does a person do when everything is gone except the iPod containing all your music?&nbsp; I&#039;ve done some research and see that some people say you&#039;re doomed.&nbsp; Others say there is a 50 step method in iTunes.&nbsp; But if you press one wrong key, you wipe the iPod clean.<br /><br />I still have the original Apple CD that came with the iPod.&nbsp; Does it help any if I install that CD on the new laptop, rather than downloading iTunes from the Apple site, as I did?&nbsp; I doubt it, since again, the music resides on the iPod and not in my iTunes.<br /><br />If anyone has any advice, let me know.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t gone to the Apple store to inquire.&nbsp; Honestly, it&#039;s not a huge issue but I think I should resolve it before giving up on all that music.&nbsp; That iPod won&#039;t last forever.&nbsp; There must be other people who have a laptop get damaged or stolen and they have nothing left but the iPod.&nbsp; These things never happened when you had hundreds of 45s.&nbsp; Only if maybe your house burned down.<br /><br />

				Would also recommend buying a very large external drive -- over 500 gigs -- to use for storage, along with your laptop and iPod.&nbsp; I basically have my library stored in all three places, so if anything happens to one, there&#039;ll be two back-ups.&nbsp; Have also pondered the concept of online storage for any worst-case scenarios, like a house fire or such, with all three disappearing.&nbsp; With just over 14,000 tracks on this thing (and continually growing), I wouldn&#039;t want to mess around with any nightmare scenarios.

				senuti is also a free download that will transfer music from ipod back to computer.<br /><br />it works pretty well.&nbsp; you can just search for it online and it will come up.<br /><br />ps...senuti is itunes spelled backward.

				This advice is wonderful as my external drive just crashed with all the music files.&nbsp; We were able to at least salvage the files from the iPods!
