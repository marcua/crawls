				I&#039;m looking for a 1 bdrm in the Ditmars area for around $1200 or so, close to subway...any advice? I&#039;ve met with some realtors/brokers that people here recommended but I&#039;m trying to get as much input as possible, no luck so far.&nbsp; Looking to move by May 15th, thanks!

				I used the broker next to Trattoria L&#039;Incotra (SIC) on 31st ST, just off the Northwest corner of Ditmars. Anyway, they gave me a discount on the fee, and got me a 1br for 1200, grant it, that was last year, and the rental mkt is even crazier Now.

				If you want to be in the ditmars area, go to all the real estate agents there and call them to find out what they have as it comes in.&nbsp; THat is your best for sure but you have to be persistent as good deals come and go fast.

				Are they getting 1200 for a 1 BR up here already? I thought you could get one for around a grand still. Anyway just try craigslist as well. Unfortunately some brokers do take advantage of people, but I don&#039;t know which ones. You shouldn&#039;t pay more than a months fee.

				I&#039;ve been seeing 1 Bdrms for b/t 1100-1300, on craigslist and thru brokers.&nbsp; I did have a broker try to tell me &quot;you can&#039;t a 1bdrm here for less than 1300 anymore&quot; which I know isn&#039;t true.&nbsp; The brokers that I&#039;ve been talking to were recommended by people on this board and so far they&#039;ve been good (depending how things turn out I will put in a good word for them, for any future apt-seekers)

				Rent-Direct sucks, I dont know but I dont buy into those sites where you have to pay to see listings.&nbsp; I got a 2 bedroom in ditmars for 1100.&nbsp; It CAN happen, but what works best is working with the agents, calling them, hounding them even to find you a spot and being persistent about it.&nbsp; Checking craigslist of course, but you will find that it is the brokers posting on there anyways, RARELY would there be a by owner posting.&nbsp; Also be mindful of the pictures you see them post too because sometimes they use pictures from different apartments on listings to get you to call.<br /><br />Ditmars try:<br /><br />Metropolis - Nick, he is always all over the place but will work with you and find you sometimes 1000 1br deals<br />Century 21 - George, he is very patient and a straight shooter, will find you places but u gotta call him<br />Metroline - Tanya, she is aiite but does have some good listings<br />Buy Sell RE - Eva, very cool agent and follows up with u

				According to at least one of my friends, he&#039;s pretty infamous, but Steffan at Partridge Realty (http://www.partridgerealty.net/index.htm) helped us find our apartment in the Ditmars area and he was the only broker who actually seemed to pay attention to us and our needs. I would highly recommend them.

				So I found a great 1 bdrm for $1300 near Broadway in the 30&#039;s, moved in over the weekend.&nbsp; I got the apt. from Alex at Metropolis Realty...I would definitely recommend him.&nbsp; Thanks for all the info!

				Hi maNY07<br />Did it take long for you to find your apt. at Broadway and 30th. Can you elaborate on how it was to work with<br />Alex from Metropolis. I am moving to NYC from Toronto and am looking to find an apt. in Astoria in that same price range and area.<br />Thanks :-)

				I found my apt. after my second visit with Alex, so pretty quickly.&nbsp; I just gave him my criteria and he was able to show me 3 places each time I saw him based on that (all nice places too, no dumps).&nbsp; When I picked one he set up a meeting with the landlord at his office and I was all set.&nbsp; It&#039;s all about timing; brokers are getting new apartments all the time, so when you go to see one there&#039;s a good chance you will be the first person to see it since it&#039;s been &quot;on the market.&quot;

				Sounds like the process of finding an apartment wasn&#039;t too difficult for you, that&#039;s great. Hope to find a place with the same ease. Will be coming to NYC at the end of this week to do a look see and get sense of the neighbourhood.<br />&nbsp;:-)
