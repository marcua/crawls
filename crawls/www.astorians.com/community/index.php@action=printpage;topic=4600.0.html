				Since I&#39;ve been getting positive reviews about my truffles, I&#39;ve definitely decided to make more candy to sell for Valentine&#39;s Day.&nbsp; I realize Valentine&#39;s Day is quite possibly the world&#39;s most ludicrous holiday, however as a budding pastry cook I feel it would be foolish not to capitalize.&nbsp; &nbsp;:wink: Again, many thanks to my December truffle customers for their orders!<br /><br />I&#39;m offering 6 flavors this time (11 got too crazy).&nbsp; These are the best of the lot, based on your feedback and my own personal opinion.&nbsp; (As the saying goes, the chef is always right):<br /><br />Hazelnut ganache, rolled in dark chocolate and garnished with feuilletine <br />Caramel ganache, rolled in dark chocolate and garnished with chopped pecans<br />Raspberry-Chambord ganache, rolled in dark chocolate and garnished with almond dust <br />Chili-infused ganache, rolled in dark chocolate and garnished with spicy cocoa<br />NEW:<br />Orange ganache, rolled in dark chocolate and garnished with white chocolate drizzles<br />Espresso-infused ganache, with a hint of Kahlua, rolled in dark chocolate and garnished with chocolate-covered espresso bean<br /><br />Choose any combination of 6 truffles.&nbsp; Packaging will be the same as before, but the prices have changed as follows:<br />Clear bag with ribbon, 6 truffles&nbsp; $10<br />White candy box with ribbon, 6 truffles&nbsp; $12<br /><br />Also, thanks to kind words from a very sweet friend of mine, I will be selling scones in the following flavors for $2 each:<br />Mini chocolate chip<br />Orange-cranberry (available vegan)<br />Herb<br />Parmesan - Black Pepper<br />Lemon-currant (available vegan)<br />I&#39;m also trying to develop a low-fat, whole wheat variety with mixed fruit, which would also be vegan.&nbsp; I&#39;ll post again if that one works out.&nbsp; <br /><br />They will be individually wrapped.&nbsp; 3 is the minimum order; mix and match. Perfect for breakfast, or for a snack with tea.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)<br /><br />Feel free to order now; product will not be available until Saturday, January 13th.&nbsp; Last orders will be taken Sunday, February 11. I&#39;m offering delivery again in Astoria.&nbsp; If you&#39;re interested in ordering, or have questions, PM or email me at michelle31980@gmail.com.<br /><br />Thanks in advance!!

				OK, JD&#39;s truffles are really delicious, but let me tell you - her scones are simply amazing!&nbsp; I have never eaten a better scone than JD&#39;s, and I come from good English Canadian and Scottish stock and I know my scones.&nbsp; I absolutely positively encourage you to order some scones.&nbsp; I ordered a bunch and they are all gone now, my household having eaten them up already.&nbsp; I love the sweet ones, especially the orange cranberry.&nbsp; But the lemon currant and chocolate chip are exquisite as well.&nbsp; If you order them you WILL NOT be disappointed.&nbsp; I can&#39;t emphasize enough how incredibly delicious these scones are, not to mention they are beautiful and beautifully packaged.<br /><br />JD, I need to put another order in!&nbsp; Once I hear from my housemate, I&#39;ll let you know.<br /><br />Treat yourself to these scones.&nbsp; You know you are worth it!!&nbsp;

				Ok. So the last time I ordered your truffles I was supposed to give them as gifts. Piggy me ate them all by myself. I can&#39;t use the excuse that I am giving them to my husband for valentine&#39;s day as he can&#39;t eat chocolate. So perhaps I can try the scones! Though don&#39;t be surprised if you get a emergency I need truffles e-mail!&nbsp; :-D<br /><br />Your truffles rock. Good luck JD!<br /><br />( I will pm you a scone order shortly!)

				Hiya folks!<br /><br />Just want to let you all know that I am no longer selling the chocolate chip or orange cranberry scones through Astorians.&nbsp; If you&#39;d like those, please head on down to Freeze Peach and buy loads.&nbsp; (if you&#39;ve already put in an order, you&#39;ll still get them, I&#39;m just not taking any new orders for those two things.)<br /><br />But there are still truffles, herb scones, parmesan black pepper scones, and lemon currant scones available!!!

				I&#39;m trying not to be a major glutton here and am trying to only eat 2 truffles a day.&nbsp; But it&#39;s so hard not to eat them all!&nbsp; They&#39;re so good!&nbsp; This is what good chocolate is all about.&nbsp; I&#39;ve never been a huge chocolate lover, but these things are unreal.&nbsp; I just had a hazelnut and chile truffle.&nbsp; Each was outstanding.&nbsp; But the chile one was great because it&#39;s such a unique mix of sweet and spicy.&nbsp; I still have a little spice floating around my mouth, and it&#39;s quite refreshing.<br /><br />I&#39;ll report back after I sample the others.&nbsp; But all you really need to know is yum.

				Wow, the chocolate must be good.&nbsp; I had a dream about them.&nbsp; Either that or I was reading astorians half asleep in the middle of the night and it carried over to my dream (again).&nbsp; *sigh*<br /><br />

				<br />some of you may know that I have a crush on JD&#039;s scones.<br /><br />http://www.freezepeach.org/menu.html<br />Usually I hit up FP for the Chocochip scones.<br /><br />I thought I would give the JD menu some other tries.<br />It seems the ChocoCherry is superchocolate. You might need only half a scone to get your fix.<br /><br />My wonderful surprise is the Cinnamon raisin.<br />Opened a scone and the wonderful scent got me excited.&nbsp; :-P&nbsp; &nbsp;:lol:<br />Delicious sweet glaze made a pretty pattern on top.<br />Then I got to taste the glorious dessert pool of cinnamon.<br />Sweet dreams are mine tonight.<br /><br />THaNKs&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />http://www.last.fm/music/Eurythmics/_/Sweet+Dreams<br /><br /><br />

				The chocolate cherry ones are amazing!&nbsp; <br /><br />I like the cinnamon raisin ones, sans raisins, too.&nbsp; They are like cinnamon sugar scones!<br /><br />This is not saying that I wouldn&#039;t eat them if they contained raisins, though...&nbsp; :)
