				(a place to rant about traffic incidents in Astoria)<br /><br />Yes, you bad female driver in the SUV, speeding down 24th Avenue looking like a deer caught in headlights. You may think I gave you the finger because I was trying to cross the street and had to stop in the middle while you barreled through the intersection. That intersection happened to have a 4-way stop sign, which you might have seen if you weren&#039;t driving so fast. You are lucky there weren&#039;t any cars around, or there could have been a real accident. I hope you get a ticket ( or 2 or 3) and wise up before you actually hurt someone.

				Was that silver SUV? A few weeks back I was jogging and was at intersection of 24th ave and 21st, and this female driver in silver suv almost run me over. and No kidding she was on the cell. I gave her the finger and I swear she gave me the look like whoever in the biggest suv has right of way. I love running 24th ave because it&#039;s so wide sidewalk, but because of lack of traffic lights I&#039;m sure someone will get hurt VERY SOON.
