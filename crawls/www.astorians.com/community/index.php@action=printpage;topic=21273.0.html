				A local catastrophe!!&nbsp; The chinese restaurant near our house closed overnight.&nbsp; Does anyone know what happened to Golden Chopsticks on 37th and Ditmars?&nbsp; They were always very busy, and got an &#039;A&#039; on the recent inspection.&nbsp; What will we do for dinner??

				Not only closed, but gutted as well.&nbsp; Odd indeed.&nbsp; The next nearest takeout Chinese place is Wah Fung, on Steinway between Ditmars and 21st Ave. Their food is pretty good, and their deliveries are generally speedy as well: 718-545-3666 if you want to try them.

				at any rate, it is too far away.&nbsp; I was hoping it was a new, nearby restaurant that could be a local, grab something fast replacement for Golden Chopsticks.&nbsp;

				NO!<br /><br /><br />That place was such a hidden treasure!&nbsp; Consistently solid NYC Chinese, nothing &quot;special&quot; but 10 times better than most of the joints that look just like it.<br /><br /><br /><br />So bummed out right now!

				Trade Fair is taking over the space.&nbsp; The owners of Golden Chopsticks have decamped (moved?&nbsp; taken over? not sure) to Dragon Phoenix, on 31st St. near the train (near Soho and Subway).&nbsp; I don&#039;t know the exact arrangements or if it&#039;s effective immediately.&nbsp; However, there is a sign wired to the awning of a realty near McCanns that says &quot;New Golden Chopsticks 718-204-8671&quot; (which is their old number).<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Consistently solid NYC Chinese, nothing &quot;special&quot; but 10 times better than most of the joints that look just like it.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Exactly.&nbsp; I was so bummed when I saw the place being gutted last week.&nbsp; I&#039;m relieved to find out they might actually still be around.&nbsp;

				Get delivery from Golden Kitchen on Astoria Blvd.&nbsp; It&#039;s the best Chinese food I&#039;ve found in the neighborhood.&nbsp; Won&#039;t help you on take out, but delivery is usually really quick from there.&nbsp; Plus, it still has &quot;Golden&quot; in the name!

				Just found this out the hard way :-( Haven&#039;t ordered in a while so we didn&#039;t know. Called the old number as usual and got some guy who was different than the normal woman or man who usually works the phone, but didn&#039;t think much of it. Placed our order, delivery arrived and an unfamiliar delivery man showed up to the door, chalked everything up to it being the weekend. Open up the bag and the packaging was all different, see the flyer has changed to some other restaurant and call the old number to see what was going on to find out it was the same owner, but seems that&#039;s about all that remained the same.<br /><br />Feels like we were baited and switched almost, wish I saw this post earlier. Food from the phoenix place isn&#039;t horrid like some local places, but doesn&#039;t hold a candle to Golden Chopsticks. Makes me wonder what happened to their staff, but I doubt there&#039;s any chance we&#039;ll get the old flavor back since the place the phone number redirects to seems to be established already and has their own ways of doing things (way too much food coloring for my liking, mushy smaller wontons in the wonton soup and not nearly as many veggies).<br /><br />I&#039;m quite sad. RIP Golden Chopsticks
