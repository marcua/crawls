				Sadly an elderly man was hit by a car this evening while crossing 21st Ave, pushed across the intersection and reportedly killed as a result. According to witnesses the driver of the Mercedes was a man in his early sixties who failed a Breathalyzer at the scene. He might have gunned his accelerator to beat a yellow light. None of this is confirmed but that was the word outside as to why the intersection was completely closed down with blood on the street this evening. Very sad. <br /><br />My comment: people drive far too aggresively through these densely populated neighborhoods. You can see it in action at almost any time of day on main streets and side streets. Less meter maids and more speed traps.

				very sad.<br /><br />though i am always amazed at the bravery of older astorians, crossing against lights, middle of the street, backs to oncoming traffic. some of the worst drivers in new york live/ride through here.

				Astoria seems to have the worst drivers <em>and</em> pedestrians. <br />We are inundated with people who have zero conception of idea of public space.&nbsp; People walk and drive as if they are in their own private world.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;

				having lived all over nyc for the past two decades, it&#039;s definitely astoria. it&#039;s worse than downtown brooklyn, which was harrowing in its own right. but i&#039;ve never had so many near misses in the few scant years i&#039;ve been here. the texters are very special (twice rolling through a stop sign while texting, once through a red light by hoyt ave south), but i&#039;m somewhat pleased that it seems to extend beyond the boundaries of race, class and gender.<br /><br />black, white, young, old, native born or recent arrival...no one can drive worth a damn. 21st street is particularly bad, lots of red light running up by hoyt.<br /><br />maybe astoria was built on a native american burial ground where they stuck the dudes who couldn&#039;t ride horses?

				Tons of people blow through the light at 31st Street/21st Ave as it&#039;s changing then gun it to make the light at 35th Street.&nbsp; On a daily basis I see this happen since I live right there and there have been several times I would have been hit had I not been paying attention.

				I agree about those lights.&nbsp; Some are in fact, not street legal.&nbsp; Mostly the very blue tinted ones that you normally see on muscle cars.&nbsp; I just want to be clear that my point was that I believe that pedestrians have an obligation to predict precarious situatiuons and try to avoid them.&nbsp; Like me in my black coat at night, I cannot expect to march into a crosswalk and be safe when a car is making a turn at over 20 MPH and likely will not see me.&nbsp; We live in a congested area.&nbsp; It would be a lot safer if drivers, bikers, and pedestrians all did their thing defensively, and not as though they own their space and can pretend no one else exists.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also seen people in Astoria avoid a sidewalk if there is 2&quot; of snow on it and instead, walk in the road like it&#039;s a country lane.&nbsp; Beyond stupid.
