				a great piece of legislature that is being considered, and supported by the aspca. if you have a pet (or are an animal lover), check it out, write a letter to your representative (link is in the article), and pass on the word!<br /><br />http://dogs.about.com/b/2009/09/26/your-dog-could-be-a-tax-write-off.htm#gB3

				I was hoping that the discussion would be more about the proper role of government and not the &quot;my pets equals others children&quot;. But since it is there, let&#039;s look at this logically. You say that you will not benefit from others children. That is not true. We live in a society that believes, for better or worse, in intergenerational transfer of wealth. Today&#039;s workers fund retirement for today&#039;s retirees with the expectaction that future generations fund theirs. I don&#039;t make the rules I just live by them. Children will grow and become adults. Hopefully, productive adults. No matter how wonderful and loving someones pet is, I don&#039;t expect them to pick up any part of my future needs.<br />As for the funding of education; there are many arguments about the cost of an educated vs an uneducated one. The one I&#039;ll make is this; somebody paid for your education.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">i think this would entice people to have pets </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Is it really a good idea for people to make a decision to adopt a pet based on a tax subsidy?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">that&#039;s why one of the biggest (earliest) signs of a sociopath is the abuse of animals (this last bit is also a fact).</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Abuse of animals is actually one of the last signs of a sociopath. Are you advocating putting animals in homes to prevent people from becoming a sociopath? That seems somewhat cruel.<br /><br />I really do love animals and agree with the benefits of pet ownership. Amazingly, this has gone on extremely well without government intervention. But if more people adopt or buy pets based on subsidies more pets, not less, will end up in shelters or worse.

				first off, let&#039;s agree to disagree on the issue of this mandate.&nbsp; secondly, it&#039;s quite possible i&#039;m not explaining myself properly, so here&#039;s a little clarification using your points as reference...<br /><br /><em>&quot;Is it really a good idea for people to make a decision to adopt a pet based on a tax subsidy?&quot;</em><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;--i don&#039;t think anyone who doesn&#039;t want a pet (or likes animals) is merely going to get them for a $3500 annual subsidy/tax credit.&nbsp; as foolish as people can be, i don&#039;t think many are THAT foolish.&nbsp; i do think however that RESPONSIBLE people who want a pet (or an additional pet) may be &quot;enticed&quot; to do so with a little relief.&nbsp; <strong>MUCH more importantly (as mentioned previously), the people who have had to give up their pets due to financial reasons, may now be able to afford to keep them with such a break and keep them from being euthanized or out of shelters (it&#039;s been reported that this is happening more and more often during the recession).</strong><br /><br /><em>&quot;Abuse of animals is actually one of the last signs of a sociopath. Are you advocating putting animals in homes to prevent people from becoming a sociopath? That seems somewhat cruel.&quot;</em><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;--are you kidding me?&nbsp; is this really how you read my comments?&nbsp; don&#039;t be daft!&nbsp; of course i don&#039;t advocate putting animals in the hands of sociopaths.&nbsp; i believe (from my own experience) that people who grow up around animals are more likely to have a tremendous respect/love for them, and may think twice about what they do to them through the course of their lives (domestically and in the wild).&nbsp; i think pets in households reinforce these &quot;humanity&quot; issues in human beings on a daily basis, especially in the instances of families/kids having pets (it also promotes a sense of responsibility).&nbsp; as an (extreme) example, there are prison programs where inmates care and train dogs for assistance programs, and as a result their whole attitude on life changes...i think this says a lot for the power of animals in one&#039;s life.<br /><br /><em>&quot;You say that you will not benefit from others children. That is not true.....As for the funding of education; there are many arguments about the cost of an educated vs an uneducated one. The one I&#039;ll make is this; somebody paid for your education.&quot;</em><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;--yes of course children are the future...yadda, yadda, yadda...&nbsp; i never advocated that my taxes shouldn&#039;t go to schools, etc.&nbsp; i used that as an argumentative point towards you not feeling that society should contribute to my pets.&nbsp; to me the comparison is still the same though.&nbsp; i don&#039;t have kids, never will, so in return for MY lifetime contribution to our society&#039;s educational system, i want some sort of break in my taxes for the creatures that i consider my children.&nbsp; it&#039;s not like it&#039;s a big chunk either.&nbsp; in the lifetime of a pet, a $3500 tax break isn&#039;t going to pay for the total health and welfare of my pet.&nbsp; it also isn&#039;t like it&#039;s an annual cash handout...it&#039;s a tax credit.&nbsp; the government wouldn&#039;t be paying for me to have pets, it&#039;s just a break.&nbsp; and as to someone paying for my education, as you put it, i&#039;m sure my family&#039;s taxes had some contribution to their only child&#039;s education, just as mine goes to yours (maybe not literally yours, but you know what i mean).<br /><br />i&#039;d further argue that in addition to pets being a big quality-of-life plus for our society, that they also have a huge financial value to it.&nbsp; i&#039;m sure you know that pet care is a billion dollar industry.&nbsp; there are millions of people out there who make their living from all the money that people spend on their pets (from the production and retail of food and accessories to their medical care).&nbsp; i&#039;m sure all those people would also agree that pets are pretty important to our society.<br /><br />by the way, i&#039;m not sure what you meant by &quot;proper role of government&quot; but i have a feeling we might disagree on some of those issues as well...&nbsp; &nbsp;:wink:&nbsp; besides the government does have a role with our pets.&nbsp; we have to register them, and follow their laws about them, don&#039;t we?&nbsp; albeit a small amount, the city gets money every year from me for my pets.&nbsp; part of this mandate is that in order to get the break, they would need to be registered.&nbsp; i think this act alone could also promote more responsibility in people for their pets, as i&#039;m sure not everyone is registering them.&nbsp; as i also originally mentioned, i think there should be a further clause that the animals should be adopted (not bought), but that may be stepping over the line of a person&#039;s right to choose where their pet comes from.

				In our current fiscal situation, I don&#039;t see a burning need to boost pet ownership by reducing federal tax intake.&nbsp; <br /><br />Simply put, the federal government should have no interest in enticing citizens to buy dogs with the lure of cash.&nbsp; There are enough willing pet owners without this subsidy.<br /><br />Finally, there is enough dog crap littering the streets of Astoria as it is.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Maybe I can explain the strange vibe. (or maybe I can&#039;t since your position is viewed more positively) This has nothing to do with pets. This has to do with a government structure that pits self interests against each other to further consolidate its grip on power. This structure will bankrupt a great nation to simply further its own selfish goals. It will then justify it saying that it&#039;s for the greater good.<br />Here is an opinion piece from a conservative blogger:<br /><br />http://www.americanissuesproject.org/blogs/columns/archive/2009/10/01/pet-projects-and-tax-reform.aspx<br /><br />The tax code should not be used as a carrot or a stick. It should be used strictly to raise the necessary funds to pay the debts of this nation.<br />But now Thad McCotter (R-MI) wants to fund pet ownership at the cost of non pet owners. And home owners are subsidised by renters. And parents are subsidised by people without children. And a self perpetuating system goes on and on as long as people are content to get their little piece at the expense of someone else.

Again, I’m sorry but I vote for people over pets.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />the break doesn&#039;t just include vet bills, it includes all expenses for a legally owned pet.<br /><br />yes there should be universal health care for humans, but that&#039;s a whole bigger issue that&#039;s going to take a lot more than what&#039;s being discussed here, which includes all the lobbyists for the pharmaceutical and insurance companies.<br /><br />i&#039;m sorry...maybe it&#039;s naive, but i honestly don&#039;t see why we can&#039;t have both.&nbsp; <br /><br />i know that regardless the situation i&#039;m in, i would find a way to take care of my family, which includes my pet.&nbsp; a pet is forever, and if it meant sacrificing on other things, i wouldn&#039;t give that pet up for the world.&nbsp; if for some reason i had to move, i wouldn&#039;t even consider living in a place that didn&#039;t accept pets.&nbsp; yes, it&#039;s all about priorities, and my pet is pretty far up there on my list.&nbsp; you may not feel the same, but i vote the other way.

				I think of households with pets as families.<br />&nbsp;:mrgreen:<br /><br /><br />It would be great to have 100% of earned income to decide whether to have a pet, raise a family, buy healthcare, get an education, save for retirement,...<br />But then we would not ask the govt. for assistance to allow those for us. <br />And consider.<br /><br />http://www.brillig.com/debt_clock/<br /><br />(http://www.brillig.com/debt_clock/debtiv.gif)<br /><br />11.7 Trillion debt as of today if I have the decimal places correct.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				y&#039;know i just had a thought which i keep bringing up in the most roundabout ways...<br /><br />we all spend our entire lives paying taxes...everything from (and not just including):&nbsp; sales tax, gas tax, income tax....everything.&nbsp; my taxes along with everyone else&#039;s goes to all of our society&#039;s various programs, to the wars, to the maintenance of roads, to paying salaries of city/state/federal employees (just to name a few off the top of my head).<br /><br />i&#039;ve never once advocated that my contribution not go to the social funds that i don&#039;t participate in, but the minute i show support for something that might benefit me directly (and people like me), the response is &quot;sorry too expensive.&quot;&nbsp; isn&#039;t there also an argument out there about how people will spend more when they&#039;re given some incentive to spend?<br /><br />plus on top of it all, this is a program that has other non-financial benefits as well.&nbsp; sorry i just don&#039;t get the opposition.

				Not sure how I feel about this but I have taken in four strays and the bills are pretty high.&nbsp; $200 every few weeks for food, vet bills, grooming etc.&nbsp; It was my decision to take them in and it is now my responsibility to give them a home and provide for them.&nbsp; A tax break would be welcome but I think there is just too much going on today!

Stop the presses. I agree with Debbie!&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />While it would be nice to be able to give a tax break to people with pets, especially those who take in strays, we have a lot of programs that are a lot more important than that which need the money.
