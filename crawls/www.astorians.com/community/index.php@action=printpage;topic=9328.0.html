				I wasn&#039;t sure whether these two articles should be posted in Rants or Local News, but since it&#039;s bad news I figured they belonged in this thread. AstoriaLuv informed us on a different thread that a homicide had occurred in LIC. Here are the details:<br />http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2008/01/28/2008-01-28_dad_of_2_shot_dead_after_party.html<br /><br />I believe I had read somewhere on this board that (if I remember correctly) somewhere in our neighborhood the lightposts had been gutted? Here&#039;s another article of interest about what is happening to our city by scavengers lured by the rising value of metals:<br />http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2008/01/28/2008-01-28_thieves_cash_in_on_price_of_copper-1.html<br /><br />A part of the article that was not included in the on-line article was this side-bar:<br /><br />METAL MISCHIEF<br />Some of the places metal thieves have struck-and the damage caused.<br />East River Park: $175,000<br />Riverside Park: $10,000 in wire and 70-year-old bronze plaque pried from a boulder<br />Henry Hudson Parkway control room: $15,000<br />Harlem River Park: two aluminum football goalposts<br />Kissena Park: $8,000<br />source: NYC Parks Dept<br /><br />Does anyone remember by the pool there was a beautiful sidewalk plaque that is designed like a compass with four bronze fish? They mysteriously disappeared. Someone had pried them out. That was a sad day for me. :cry:<br />&nbsp;

				I know it seems stupid to reply to one&#039;s own thread, and I know that NYC is known as the &quot;Naked City&quot;, and that the death of someone we don&#039;t know is considered just another statistic, but I neglected to offer condolences to the family of the homicide victim. I&#039;m sorry. A wife lost a husband, two small children have lost a father, and a mother lost her child. THAT is a tragedy.
