				I&#039;m looking for a good manicure/pedicure place. Any suggestions? I&#039;ve gone to Rainbow Nails on 31st Ave and 41st St, but haven&#039;t been too happy with it lately.

				I LOVE Athena&#039;s on 30th Ave. (between 31st and 32st I think).&nbsp; Nice, clean great service, they walk around and give you quick, little back rubs while you are having your nails done.&nbsp; I heart them. :smitten:

				My regular place is in the city near where I work. But when I need a manicure in our area,<br />I go to Eve&#039;s nails, also on 30th Avenue. It&#039;s between 30th &amp; 31st Streets. Same owner as Athena.<br /><br />It&#039;s a smaller place, not as posh as Athena. But they offer all the same services for a lot less. <br />For instance, just their basic pedicure - not the spa one - is only $13. And they do a very good job.<br />The girls in there are very nice and it&#039;s super clean. It does get busy though and you do have to wait<br />sometimes. <br /><br />But I have to say, even though I only go there every couple of months, they always act as though<br />I&#039;m a weekly regular. <br /><br />Time Out also wrote up a place on 30th - I think it was the on near the corner of 36th Street or 35th Street -<br />it&#039;s fairly new. They said it was excellenet. Sorry, but I can&#039;t think of the name.....

				I go to Salon Tiara (Tiara Salon? I dunno) on 23rd avenue right off 31st St.&nbsp; They just opened early last summer and it&#039;s very clean &amp; the staff is super nice.&nbsp; The prices are average and they have a ton of different options for pedicures.&nbsp; There&#039;s sometimes a wait but I&#039;d really recommend them to anyone.

				I&#039;ve never gotten a manicure before, but I&#039;m sort of considering it because I&#039;ve been getting very angry at self-applied nail polish lately. Do you tip at these places or no? And do people usually make appointments or just walk in?

				Yes, you tip - you&#039;re getting a service so you tip according to the price of the service. <br /><br />Most of the nail salons in Astoria don&#039;t require an appointment - I would only make one if I wanted<br />a certain technician or was getting something other than a regular, basic manicure, like<br />silk tips for instance. <br /><br />If you&#039;re going to one of &#039;day spas&#039; like Anasa, Hydra or maybe Space, I would make an appointment - <br />I don&#039;t think they take walk-ins. <br /><br />I&#039;ve gone to Eve&#039;s Nails, on 30th Ave. between 30th and 31st Streets. Small, but very clean, good service. <br />The downside is that the wait can be long, esp. the busy days like Thursday, Friday, weekend. <br />Their regular, basic manicure is $8. <br /><br />Have fun!

				I just walk in and usually tip $3-5 depending on the service.
