				( No Yankee game this evening. Leaving some time for extra attention to wonder how would Spitzer have answered this evening. )<br />&nbsp;:lol:<br /><br />http://wkbw.com/newscastvi.aspx<br /><br />http://wkbw.com/election/default.aspx<br /><br />7News to Host Candidate Debate&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Aug 28, 2006 - Who&#39;s Tom Suozzi? How about John Faso? If you feel you don&#39;t know enough about these candidates for Governor of New York, tune in to 7News at 8 p.m. tonight, August 28. <br /><br />WKBW-TV is sponsoring a candidate debate at the Center for the Arts on the University at Buffalo Amherst campus. 7News will carry the debate live as will sister stations WTVH in Syracuse and WBNG in Binghamton. <br /><br />Suozzi and Faso will answer questions from a panel of journalists moderated by 7News anchor Keith Radford. Viewers can e-mail questions to debatequestion@wkbw.com . <br /><br />There are no more tickets available to attend the event but you can watch a live webcast here on WKBW.com as well as watch it live on Ch. 7.<br /><br />Democrat Eliot Spitzer was also invited to the debate but declined the invitation.<br />&nbsp;:|

				TRX - Did you watch the debate (sans Spitzer)?&nbsp; How did Suozzi and Faso do?<br />Is anyone following the State Senate race in Jackson Heights/Elmhurst between State Senator John Sabini and City Councilmember Hiram Monseratte?

				http://www.ny1.com/ny1/content/index.jsp?stid=1&amp;aid=62182<br /><br />http://www.gawker.com/news/clips/tom-suozzi-do-you-want-this-mans-finger-on-the-button-of-those-missiles-we-have-aimed-at-jersey-196704.php<br /><br />http://www.igpa.uiuc.edu/ethics/spitzer-bio.htm<br /><br />So there is a forum on ny1 tonight from locations around NYS, including Pace.<br />Hoping the audience questions share light on voter interests.<br />(Perhaps they would include education costs and state charter schools; support of real estate developers versus home/business owner rights)<br /><br />Also linked are some fun silly clips at gawker.<br />And looking for some more info on Spitzer.<br /><br />The other night did not hold my attention, perhaps due to the location and questions. Other parts of NYS are having economic difficulties.<br />Questions on gambling and casinos, county revenues, power transmission, ...<br />Suozzi seemed relaxed, but I hardly found where there were chances to distinguish himself.<br />Would Spitzer have answered similarly?<br />Will this be, if he chooses, just Spitzer racing against himself.<br />Apparently he could decline free airtime for q&amp;a. (Is he planning a merciful campaign? Or will he find a reason to blanket airwaves? Any sort of Bloomberg style campaign)<br />Maybe in time, we will see more of the candidates with what their aims are for the next 4 years.<br /><br />While the Monseratte race may pass in the news, I dont know what much of a difference it would mean in the outcome. As long as Silver has the Assembly, does it matter.<br /><br />***<br />I am looking at NYS and the level of taxation.<br />Surprisingly it is not out of line with much of the NE and Cali.<br />But NYS sure does spend a lot.<br />While there are many factors, much of the growth in the US occurs in lower taxed states.<br />Whoever takes over for Pataki, I hope they could bring state finances under better management.<br /><br />Cheers.<br />Is it taco time yet?<br /><br />
