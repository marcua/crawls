			I suggest you live near the last stop on the N/W (ditmars) so that when you commute, you&#039;d have a seat in the mornings :wink:

			I of course have to pimp the Ditmars stop. Having a seat is nice. When I worked in midtown, it would take me 30 minutes to get to work door to door (including my 10 minute walk to the train). My commute downtown is now 45-50 minutes, door to door. It&#039;s totally worth it. My roommates and I also all graduated college about a year ago...and I tend to run into quite a few people in the same boat in the area. I recommend checking out the threads in the Restaurants &amp; Food portion of this site.

			Hi, <br />We live in Astoria near Steinway/Broadway and are considering moving to Ditmars--near 20th ave in the 30s. I know that it&#039;s more residential. This is sort of a weird question but I would love to hear how others perceive the difference between the two areas. I&#039;ve also noticed that people who live around us are a bit dismissive of the lower ditmars area and I wonder if anyone can explain why. They seem very similar in terms of population. <br /><br />I hope this doesn&#039;t seem like a bizarre, unfocused query. <br /><br />thanks!

			Heeeey, you&#039;d totally be my neighbor if you moved (I live on Steinway near 21 Av.)<br /><br />Ok. This is why I like it better up here (and yes, we&#039;re north of you guys, despite the bizarre fact that the avenues go down in numbers as you get further north, and the streets go lower in numbers as you go west - seriously, everything about us is opposite of Manhattan, hahah...)<br /><br />Anyway. I like it up here since (and I realize a lot of these have to do with owning a car/driving, don&#039;t know if that&#039;s a factor for you) its quieter and cleaner but still distinctly Astoria, you always get a seat on the N/W and the train never expresses past us (since we&#039;re the last stop), also there is almost always a train waiting so if its snowing/raining/hot/cold, you don&#039;t have to stand out on the platform, it feels more neighborhoody (to me, anyway, but that may be because I&#039;ve been here for 2 years), its closer to the bridges and the GCP for when you need to leave the city, the traffic isn&#039;t as crazy, its easier to park up here, we have Best Yet (supermarket), Ditmars Gyro Place (YUM!), Thai Elephant (DOUBLE YUM!), its about a 15 minute walk to Astoria Park, that new place that everyone&#039;s talking about that I haven&#039;t gotten around to checking out yet is here, and a whole bunch of other things that I can&#039;t really think of at the moment.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know that I would live in the Broadway/Steinway area. Too busy and loud for me, and I can&#039;t imagine finding a parking spot is any fun. The Q101 will get me to that area anyway in under 10 minutes if I need to get down there. I guess I&#039;d live there if I had a garage/driveway. Up here, I usually get a spot either right out front or around the corner on 20th Rd.

			so you are a potential neighbor!<br /><br />We do have a car and have many awful experiences parking in our current area. parking seems SO much easier in your part. Good to hear. That is my impression too. I know it&#039;s lower than where we are (I read a post about a sewer smell) and nearer the industrial area (which I guess is not so good). <br /><br />When I had my first child it was late fall and I used to walk for hours with her in the stroller and I always went&nbsp; to Ditmars. Just crossing Astoria blvd and into this quieter, calmer area was really nice. We had just moved to this neighborhood and I would tell my husband about the &quot;bizarro astoria&quot; on the other side of astoria blvd, where there were these big train tracks and little houses and not so many apt buildings. I always liked it.<br /><br />We&#039;ll probably move there.. we&#039;re buying and it&#039;s the first time and we are FReAKING OUT.&nbsp;
