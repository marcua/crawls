				I now notice no mention of the Controller&#039;s Race.&#160; Why no mention of Harry Wilson?&#160; Is that because Cuomo&#039;s going to come out at Noon today and endorse Repub Wilson for Controller??&#160; Wilson had already said he&#039;d endorse Cuomo if the teaslurper from Buffalo Carl Paladillo should get the Repub nod.&#160; My, the soup gets thicker.

				If folks are going to vote, you have choices.<br /><br />Controller might not come up yet, because there is no primary there.<br />But there is one for Lt Gov: Rick&#039;s bud v Ognibene<br /><br /><br />The raising of taxes to encourage folks to leave NYS will likely continue in most cases.

				I&#039;ve been fascinated watching the Palladino-Lazio race, really interested in seeing who prevails tomorrow.<br /><br />Keep in mind Dino has a primary against Ryan Brunberg, so that has to get decided too.&nbsp; Should be interesting.
