				Hello all,<br />My partner and I will be (excitedly) moving near the Broadway stop in just a week. We currently live in Park Slope, where we&#039;ve grown accustomed to composting food scraps in our local community garden. Does anyone know of a compost drop-off site in Astoria? I found an old thread on this site discussing composting basic and indoor worm bins. We&#039;re considering the latter, but I&#039;m wary of starting off on the wrong foot with our new landlords should the inevitable fruit flies become unmanageable. I hope to meet many of you green-minded Astorians during the coming year!<br />Best,<br />Ginger<br />

				Hi Ginger,<br /><br />Welcome to the &#039;hood. There is a community garden just getting off its feet that would *love* compost: Two Coves Community Garden at the corner of Astoria Blvd, 8th St and Main Ave. It&#039;s sort of an interesting neighborhood. A little closer, ARROW community garden *might* have a composting area. Not sure though. I know Two Coves does.<br /><br />As for worm bin. I just got my worms today! Wooo. I was taught a little trick to keep fruit flies down: keep a bag as you chop your veggies for your food scraps and put it in the freezer every night. When you go to feed your worms, give them some of the frozen goods. It kills whatever bad microbes you don&#039;t want multiplying in your own bin. Not sure if it should thaw first, but we&#039;ll see if my worms survive the night since I just fed them...

				Thanks belle,<br /><br />I&#039;ll be sure to check out Two Coves Community Garden. Does anyone know the cross streets for the ARROW garden? I&#039;ve got some exploring to do!<br /><br />Also, I&#039;m curious to hear how your worms respond to frozen food. Thanks for the advice.<br />

				Hey there again,<br /><br />My worms don&#039;t mind the frozen food at all. I just stick my extra choppings in a plastic bag in the freezer and when I want to feed them I grab a handful and bury it. I try to brush the worms aside so I don&#039;t freeze them, but all in all, by the time it melts they are ready to go after it. It also adds some nice moisture to the mix as it melts.

				how does this work? do you bring food scraps or does it have to be soil to give away?&nbsp; I don&#039;t know how to compost in a little apt.<br /><br />Thanks!

				Please forgive me for my ignorance.&nbsp; Is the point of growing worms in your house so that they eat your scraps?&nbsp; Or is there a different purpose?&nbsp; <br /><br />On a different note, I have decided that this year, if I get those microscopic white bugs that eat the leaves off my flowers, I would buy some ladybugs.&nbsp; Apparently, this is the natural way to deal with the problem.&nbsp; <br /><br />Please explain the concept of composting please.

				Oooh, ladybugs are vicious and swift when it comes to eating those other bugs.&nbsp; It&#039;s a good thing.<br /><br />Composting is good because it helps eliminate the waste you might usually put in the trash that then goes in the landfill.&nbsp; The worms eat the food scraps that you feed them, process it through their bodies, and the resulting compost can be used in houseplants and other plants. It makes your plants healthier.&nbsp; It&#039;s an environmentally friendly option.

				Since I&#039;ve gotten my worm bin my food scraps have been reduced tremendously! Esp all the smelly stuff. I produce half as much waste and only need to take the garbage out if I have meat scraps that smell (since the worms can&#039;t eat that). They&#039;re power eaters though! I give them about 1/2 to 1 pound of scraps a night. The bottom of my bin (after about 2 months) is beautiful compost that my houseplants are eying! <br /><br />Two Coves has planting spaces you can rent (or something). Not really sure. It&#039;s a new community garden, the organizer Garret is working hard on it this year. Planting lots of trees and has a compost scrap for people to dump their stuff (they take all your non-dairy, non-meat scraps and have a corner to dump them to decompose there). I suggest stopping by on a Saturday. They have sort of an open day then from like 11-2 or something. Garret is usually there then and you can chat with him.<br /><br />I think ARROW also has spaces you can &quot;rent&quot; to grow your own stuff. Not sure if they still do it though.

				belle, thanks for your update!&nbsp; I just put my worm bin together about a week ago, and my little worms are hard at work doing what they do best.&nbsp; Do yours eat through that 1/2 pound/pound each day?&nbsp; How voracious was their appetite at the beginning of their time with you?<br /><br />Also, what vegetable matter do you avoid giving them, if any?<br /><br />Thanks for the Two Coves composting info, too!&nbsp; I&#039;ll have to stop by soon.

				I&#039;m in the CSA so they basically get all my veggie scraps and coffee grinds (tea bags are okay too). Dead house plants/ leaves are also good, though I was told no store bought flowers (b/c you don&#039;t know what is sprayed on them). No citrus, no dairy (but egg shells are okay), no oil (so nothing if it&#039;s been cooked in oil), no meat/ fish or bones, and I think no processed sugar. I also give them most of my junk mail-- take off stamps, plastic, staples and gummy seal and no glossy paper (no magazine paper) but newspaper is great and keeps thing dry if it&#039;s getting too wet (though they def like a moist environment).<br /><br />I have a lot of tomato scraps but try not to give them too much b/c I don&#039;t want the soil to get too acidic (same if you drink a lot of coffee). But Two Coves will take your citrus and extra acid scraps b/c they have a larger area for matter. Cores and rinds they really love-- avocado peels and pits, apple cores, melon rinds and pits and corn husks (dried out for 24-48 hours)/cores, but these items take longer for them to eat through.<br /><br />I cut everything up to about 1-2 inch pieces b/c it helps them eat it faster. They def don&#039;t eat all the food I give them every night, but it doesn&#039;t stink at all, just sort of smells faintly of soil near the bin. I sometimes skip a night or two just to let them some time to eat through if I&#039;ve given them a bunch. (Or like when I went on vaca for 10 days I just put 3 big handfuls and mixed it around and they were fine). If I have a lot of scraps one night I stick it in a bag in the freezer to use when I have nothing or when I go on vaca.<br /><br />Also, if you find an overpopulation of mites (not the nasty ones just very minute reddish ones) avocado and larger fruit pits are a great way to get rid of them-- just stick it in for 24 hours or so and remove it if you see little red guys crawling everywhere. It&#039;s a living environment so you&#039;ll always have more than just worms in there, but you don&#039;t want something to get out of control. I have had no problem with fruit flies, but the person who taught me about worm bins said she puts everything in the freezer for 24 hours (esp banana peels) to kill anything from the outside that is living in her peels and then feeds it to her worms. <br /><br />Here&#039;s a really good site for more info:&nbsp; http://www.nyccompost.org/how/wormbin.html<br /><br />

				Thanks again, belle.&nbsp; I just fed my worms some dried out basil leaves, a bit of pear, and some coffee grounds.&nbsp; I was poking around in there and found a bunch of compost already!&nbsp; Super cool.&nbsp; I think they are eating the newspaper, too, b/c I&#039;ve added strips of the stuff a couple times already, as the height of the contents of the bin shrink.&nbsp; I also want to make sure the bin doesn&#039;t get overly wet and that there&#039;s enough to cover any food I put in there.&nbsp; I&#039;m not feeding them tons of food right now, but what I do feed them seems to be enough.&nbsp; It smells really earthy in there, too, and so far I haven&#039;t had a problem with offensive odor.<br /><br />It&#039;s fun to see the progress!
