				Con Ed Urges <br />Business Customers <br />in Northwest Queens to <br />Immediately Turn Off All Electric Service<br /><br />Due to continuing equipment problems in the Northwest Queens area, Con Edison is asking all of its business customers in that area of Queens to IMMEDIATELY discontinue their use of all electric service. The affected areas are Long Island City, Sunnyside, Woodside, Hunters Point and the Astoria neighborhoods of Queens. The affected area is bounded by the East River on the west and north, the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway on the east and Newtown Creek on the south.<br /><br />***<br /><br />LICBDC encourages you to share this important alert from Con Edison widely within the Queens business community, and to help by conserving electricity as they request.<br /><br />

				We have not had power since Monday around 3 PM.&nbsp; Monday night was hell and we (me and my fiance and dog) figured if the electricity was not on yesterday evening afterwork, we&#39;d find other arrangements.&nbsp; Well, it was on slightly around 5:30 PM, but went completely out again at 11:30 PM.&nbsp; And, it&#39;s still out today.&nbsp; Just got off the phone with a really nice ConEd rep.&nbsp; He said they&#39;ve had meetings every few hours and are being told they cannot tell customers anything, except that they&#39;re working on it.&nbsp; What really scared me though, was when he told me he couldn&#39;t even tell me what day it&#39;d be fixed.&nbsp; What day????&nbsp; <br /><br />BTW, I live on 44th street between 30th and 31st ave -- the cables were on fire Monday.

				Hi all-<br /><br />I am happy to find this great resource for Astorians.&nbsp; My partner and I moved to Astoria a little over a year ago and are very happy here!&nbsp; Just wanted to report that we live on 46th between 28th and 30th ave and had low low power until last night around 1 am when i watched my poor ceiling fan finally grind to a halt.&nbsp; We are out still as are all the stores within a few blocks.&nbsp; When I walked north and east this morning, I noticed fires in 2 different manholes being tended but electricty was working after 49th street or so.&nbsp; My parnter also reported black smoke coming from below on Steinway and 28th ave... electriciy seems to work intermittently west of steinway on 30th ave...

				As of 9:45 a.m. today, little to no power on 30th Ave./48th St. Last night was miserable! Spotty power until around 1 a.m. then nothing. No AC all night -- yuck! This morning the microwave and alarm clock flickered a bit, then died again. Another night without any AC will be unbearable. Going to see if I can find a battery-powered fan anywhere.

				I&#39;m at 34th and Broadway and have had very little power since Monday, not enough to run fans and the television at the same time, and the lights won&#39;t go on completely. &nbsp;My boyfriend is down at 28th Street between 34th and 35th Avenues, however, and still has power, so some pockets of Astoria seem to still be running. &nbsp;His power was reduced, but still running.

				Hi everyone--<br />My partner and I live at the corner of 31st st. and 21st Ave, and we spent last night with almost no electricity--just enough to keep a lightbulb going at half strength. As of sometime this morning, we&#39;ve had nothing at all. A Con Ed worker downstairs told one of the neighbors that there was no way of knowing when it&#39;d all be restored, and could be out for several days. !!! Hardly what I want to hear, but seems par for the course when it comes to Con Ed. <br /><br />[sigh]

				I guess it was good timing that I was out of the City for most of the past two days, but I returned to no power in my apartment at 21st Avenue and 24th street. Most of 21st Avenue, at least up to 31st street seemed to have no power (and we&#39;re the ones closest to the Con Ed plant, grr.) Lots of stores near the Ditmars N stop were closed, including the Starbucks and CVS. <br />

				Finally, bad press with the name &quot;Astoria&quot; abounds. &nbsp;All channels laying it on thick! &nbsp;Let&#39;s hope the message to the outer neighborhoods and the other 4 boroughs is clear - moving to this region will result in unreliable electrical service. &nbsp;You&#39;re better off paying those engouged rents where you are in Brooklyn.<br /><br />Let&#39;s see - Con Ed sold their generating capacity and went into the &quot;delivery&quot; business. &nbsp;Well, they obviously can&#39;t handle it. &nbsp;Think of this next time after a snow storm a poodle gets fricasseed on a transformer grating.<br /><br />- Cannibal

				A few things that will stick in my mind as i walked to the train along Ditmars Blvd. this morning.<br /><br />All of the shuttered businesses on Ditmars and 31Street on a bright sunny Wednesday morning.<br /><br />The traffic lights were still blinking neutral yellow and red default patterns.<br /><br />The delivery of multiple bags of ice into Hoey&#39;s Funeral Home. That one creeped me out.<br /><br />I rounded the corner and saw the employees of CVS standing in front of the gated Store front dressed in their blue CVS shirts. They all had the most heartbreaking expressions on their faces. Like &quot;Will I get paid for today?&quot;....&quot;Should I stay?&quot; Apparently the managers never contacted their employees. Nice going guys. Somebody should ask them about that.<br /><br />Traveling on the train has taken on a special hellishness now with only the N running and people desperately trying to squeeze on board.<br /><br />Did you know that Autumn is my favorite time of year?

				Sending good thoughts your way eblack!&nbsp; And &quot;cool thoughts&quot; to everyone dealing without A/C.&nbsp; At Broadway and Crescent, we&#39;re full power for now (fingers crossed).&nbsp; There have been episodes of decreased power over the past two days, but they only last for a few seconds.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				This morning,&nbsp; power here on 27 St. and 21 Ave still sucks, it&#39;s here but at a very light run.&nbsp; My fan keeps going low and then lower.&nbsp; Not high then low.&nbsp; Last night walking home from Ditmars was very dark, no lights at all, maybe one per street.<br /><br />I&#39;m watching Fox 5 right now, and they are on Ditmars and 31 St!&nbsp; There is going to be a rally to ask ConEd what the f-ck!&nbsp; This is the 4th day and it might not be til Sunday before they fix it, according to the news.&nbsp; Eckard is running on a generator.&nbsp; They&#39;re interviewing people on the street.<br /><br />My apartment has been running on low power thru all of this.&nbsp; It goes fully out at times, although I&#39;m gone all day so have no idea for how long.&nbsp; I won&#39;t dare put on the AC for fear of blowing the whole thing.&nbsp; I have no idea if a frig running on a low power is okay for the food - should I throw it all out?&nbsp; I don&#39;t want to get sick.&nbsp; My internet wouldn&#39;t run last night but is up this morning.&nbsp; <br />

				i am writing from the reading room of the public library since i have been without power since 10pm on monday. we had very limited power from two outlets this morning at 77th and ditmars. it felt like a rare treat to string together a couple of extension cords and have a fan blowing on me last night for the first time in days. needless to say, i did not get a full night sleep once again. all of our food has spoiled and we have no hot water.<br /><br />this morning i walked around midtown waiting for the library to open. i amused myself by calling con-ed a few times, calling the city a few times, calling peter vallone a few times and trying to get the mayor on the phone. unfortunately i had no luck in getting additional info.<br /><br />i have to say i feel completely let down by our fair city. at the core of what government provides for its citizens is help and relief in times of trouble and hardship. i learned today that the city is doing absolutely NOTHING during this emergency and deferring to con-ed to provide relief.<br /><br />i certainly am not asking for much but a message from the mayor saying that he knows we are suffering and that he is doing whatever he can to help would be nice. after eating out for three days, a little ice and some cold water would be a kind gesture too. perhaps it is time to get the red cross involved?<br /><br />i feel completely abandoned by the city i love and pay taxes to support.

I don&#39;t think they&#39;re liable for damage due to spikes or dropouts on a power line. They may be liable for not supplying electricity, which is why people can get food replaced, but I don&#39;t think they&#39;re liable for imperfections in the power. If you&#39;ve got that kind of equipment, I definitely recommend a good UPS (http://www.jetcafe.org/~npc/doc/ups-faq.html)! <br /><br />On the other hand, I don&#39;t think there were many spikes, just dropouts, so I suspect all your equipment will be just fine...!

				Ran home during lunch today to check on the electricity status. Still nothing. And still no cable/internet and limited cell phone access (there does seem to be some kind of connection between losing the signal and the subway, I had it happen to me a couple of times this afternoon, too ... weird). Most of 31st Street around Ditmars to 21st Ave is still shut down, traffic lights aren&#39;t working yet, and anything that <em>is</em> open is only able to be because of a generator. <br /><br />There doesn&#39;t seem to be any work getting done in that area of town right now, either. Lots of ConEd trucks driving about, but I don&#39;t see any actual work being done. In fact, I haven&#39;t seen one truck working on the block since this started Monday night ... grr.

				These kinds of problems indicate an inside wiring problem. ConEd supplies your building with one line, then that line is split off. If you have one outlet working, and others not working it&#39;s the result of damage or problems with the breakers inside your building.<br /><br />There&#39;s a slight possibility (as is the case in my building) that some of the outlets already have low voltage (even when the power is on full) and so they operate at a lower voltage than others. With a low voltage coming in from ConEd it&#39;s possible that these outlets are indeed carrying power, it&#39;s just too low for any appliance to use.<br /><br />To cycle your breakers just find the breaker box and turn off each switch one by one and then turn them back on.

				Early this evening, we had about two hours of apartment-wide low power (the most since Monday night). By this, I mean that lightbulbs were dimly on, the clock radios were blinking time and the radio would turn on, and our ceiling fan was turning slowly.

Not sure... but my upstairs neighbor (directly above me... no power?!) was told by Con Ed that because we had &quot;service&quot; to the building it was not Con Ed&#39;s problem!!<br /><br />I am on 51st and Skillman (Woodside).&nbsp; <br /><br />The neighborhood has been pretty dark -no streetlights or signal lights - until last night when we got one of those OEM floodlights installed on our corner. Now it shines REAL bright right into my bedroom window all night long.&nbsp; Thanks CONED!!&nbsp;

				There was another localized power dip here in southern Astoria at 36th Avenue.&nbsp; I refer to them as &quot;burps&quot; because the juice makes a quick recovery here.&nbsp; Just thought I&#39;d put this out there for those in terror of the next few days.<br /><br />- Cannibal<br />Giant blocks of ice for everybody!&nbsp; Gin, too!

				I woke up because it&#39;s too hot to sleep in my apartment. The outlet that my fan was plugged into just died...so I guess this is a mild case of brownout conditions.<br /><br />Fingers crossed that this is just an anomoly. Not looking forward to the heat wave.&nbsp; :-(

				I lost power for about 6 hours yesterday, but some people in my building had power, which seemed odd.&nbsp; It&#39;s not running very strong now, so I guess I&#39;m going to have to call ConEd.&nbsp; <br />Are they still doing work?

				Yeah, they&#39;re out there again today.&nbsp; WCBS880 passes on the request to conserve yet again.&nbsp; The Mon-Fri loads have got to be fierce with work offices at full strength again tomorrow.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#39;s really your last chance to get to Pep Boys for a 30 Amp generator to run the icebox and one aircon.&nbsp; If you&#39;re in a vertical roachtrap like me, place it out on the fire escape with an apology note for anyone&#39;s egress from the building that you&#39;ll be blocking!<br /><br />- Cannibal

				so far its 88 degrees in the apt and rising. we are keeping everything shut as long as possible. once the windows open we have no way to circulate the air so we&#39;re holding onto every last bit of ac&#39;d air we got! good luck Pink, i think if you still have it now-you might be ok tonight.

				Flooz, if it makes you feel any better at all, my thermometer currently reads 99 for our apartment.&nbsp; However, all our power is good to go.&nbsp; I think you&#39;re very wise to keep your windows closed for the time being.&nbsp; Best of luck to you.&nbsp; Maybe by tomorrow (or during the night!) it will all be over!!

				Just for info sake. We started out the day at 110v at Ditmars and 31st Street. Normal is 115v. By mid-day we were at 100v, and now we&#39;re around 95v. This means that Ditmars and 31st Street is already experiencing &quot;partial service&quot; just like a couple weeks ago. If we stay above 95 A/C&#39;s and fridge&#39;s will continue to run. If we keep dropping it doesn&#39;t look too good for tomorrow.<br /><br />Crossing my fingers as I shut off the computer.

				I&#39;ve got a voltage meter built into the new UPS device I bought for my computer after the last power outage. It tells me what the voltage is at. We&#39;re at 107v this morning.

				I&#39;m really nervous about the power going out; I keep thinking the fan is running a bit slow. Our cable is out, but internet is working fine. The lights have flickered a few times. I&#39;m going to sign off, looks like it&#39;s going to storm anyway.

				so last night around 1:30am there was about an hour of surging going on that kept me awake. fell back asleep. woke up in a nasty sweat at 2ish with all the power out..... its still out.<br />i just got to work after trying my hardest to sleep in 1 hour stints by taking about 3 showers. i called coned at about 5:30am and asked them what was going on and the lady told me all she could say was that a team was dispatched at 3:30am for a smoking manhole. i asked her if she could tell me where, and i got sorry ma&#39;am i can&#39;t tell you that. doh? huh? um ok. at about 9 this morning i took my last shower and sat on the stoop (cause it was much better outside) and watched about 10 power dudes from another state walk up and down the block with a bunch of papers. behind them was a cbs news van and behind that was a budget rental van giving out dry ice. from 38th st to the police station on astoria blvd. seems like a few of the manholes went to crap. on my walk to the train there were wires everywhere down the street. but it doesn&#39;t look like a whole lot of people were affected. i of course, was one of the lucky ones to lose power again! the people above us had their ac on when i last checked but the floor above them didn&#39;t have power (i heard the lady yell down to the street) i wish there were at least some kind of rhyme or reason to how everything is broken down. i&#39;m dead to the world today. i called and warned my boss that when i got in id be passing out in his office and jokingly he told me to bring a bag with enough clothes for the weekend...i thought about it for a minute too. <br />• luckily the power was long enough for me to watch the recorded psc meeting though, i will definitley be at the next one for sure.
