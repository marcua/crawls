				January 23, 2007<br />Text<br />Democratic Response of Senator Jim Webb to the Presidentâ€™s State of the Union Address<br /><br />Good evening.<br /><br />I&#39;m Senator Jim Webb, from Virginia, where this year we will celebrate the 400th anniversary of the settlement of Jamestown&nbsp; an event that marked the first step in the long journey that has made us the greatest and most prosperous nation on earth.<br /><br />It would not be possible in this short amount of time to actually rebut the President&#39;s message, nor would it be useful. Let me simply say that we in the Democratic Party hope that this administration is serious about improving education and healthcare for all Americans, and addressing such domestic priorities as restoring the vitality of New Orleans.<br /><br />Further, this is the seventh time the President has mentioned energy independence in his state of the union message, but for the first time this exchange is taking place in a Congress led by the Democratic Party. We are looking for affirmative solutions that will strengthen our nation by freeing us from our dependence on foreign oil, and spurring a wave of entrepreneurial growth in the form of alternate energy programs. We look forward to working with the President and his party to bring about these changes.<br /><br />There are two areas where our respective parties have largely stood in contradiction, and I want to take a few minutes to address them tonight. The first relates to how we see the health of our economy&nbsp; how we measure it, and how we ensure that its benefits are properly shared among all Americans. The second regards our foreign policy&nbsp; how we might bring the war in Iraq to a proper conclusion that will also allow us to continue to fight the war against international terrorism, and to address other strategic concerns that our country faces around the world.<br /><br />When one looks at the health of our economy, it&#39;s almost as if we are living in two different countries. Some say that things have never been better. The stock market is at an all-time high, and so are corporate profits. But these benefits are not being fairly shared. When I graduated from college, the average corporate CEO made 20 times what the average worker did; today, it&#39;s nearly 400 times. In other words, it takes the average worker more than a year to make the money that his or her boss makes in one day.<br /><br />Wages and salaries for our workers are at all-time lows as a percentage of national wealth, even though the productivity of American workers is the highest in the world. Medical costs have skyrocketed. College tuition rates are off the charts. Our manufacturing base is being dismantled and sent overseas. Good American jobs are being sent along with them.<br /><br />In short, the middle class of this country, our historic backbone and our best hope for a strong society in the future, is losing its place at the table. Our workers know this, through painful experience. Our white-collar professionals are beginning to understand it, as their jobs start disappearing also. And they expect, rightly, that in this age of globalization, their government has a duty to insist that their concerns be dealt with fairly in the international marketplace.<br /><br />In the early days of our republic, President Andrew Jackson established an important principle of American-style democracy&nbsp; that we should measure the health of our society not at its apex, but at its base. Not with the numbers that come out of Wall Street, but with the living conditions that exist on Main Street. We must recapture that spirit today.<br /><br />And under the leadership of the new Democratic Congress, we are on our way to doing so. The House just passed a minimum wage increase, the first in ten years, and the Senate will soon follow. We&#39;ve introduced a broad legislative package designed to regain the trust of the American people. We&#39;ve established a tone of cooperation and consensus that extends beyond party lines. We&#39;re working to get the right things done, for the right people and for the right reasons.<br /><br />With respect to foreign policy, this country has patiently endured a mismanaged war for nearly four years. Many, including myself, warned even before the war began that it was unnecessary, that it would take our energy and attention away from the larger war against terrorism, and that invading and occupying Iraq would leave us strategically vulnerable in the most violent and turbulent corner of the world.<br /><br />I want to share with all of you a picture that I have carried with me for more than 50 years. This is my father, when he was a young Air Force captain, flying cargo planes during the Berlin Airlift. He sent us the picture from Germany, as we waited for him, back here at home. When I was a small boy, I used to take the picture to bed with me every night, because for more than three years my father was deployed, unable to live with us full-time, serving overseas or in bases where there was no family housing. I still keep it, to remind me of the sacrifices that my mother and others had to make, over and over again, as my father gladly served our country. I was proud to follow in his footsteps, serving as a Marine in Vietnam. My brother did as well, serving as a Marine helicopter pilot. My son has joined the tradition, now serving as an infantry Marine in Iraq.<br /><br />Like so many other Americans, today and throughout our history, we serve and have served, not for political reasons, but because we love our country. On the political issues&nbsp; those matters of war and peace, and in some cases of life and death&nbsp; we trusted the judgment of our national leaders. We hoped that they would be right, that they would measure with accuracy the value of our lives against the enormity of the national interest that might call upon us to go into harm&#39;s way.<br /><br /><strong>We owed them our loyalty, as Americans, and we gave it. But they owed us&nbsp; sound judgment, clear thinking, concern for our welfare, a guarantee that the threat to our country was equal to the price we might be called upon to pay in defending it.<br /><br />The President took us into this war recklessly. He disregarded warnings from the national security adviser during the first Gulf War, the chief of staff of the army, two former commanding generals of the Central Command, whose jurisdiction includes Iraq, the director of operations on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and many, many others with great integrity and long experience in national security affairs. We are now, as a nation, held hostage to the predictable&nbsp; and predicted&nbsp; disarray that has followed.<br /><br />The war&#39;s costs to our nation have been staggering. Financially. The damage to our reputation around the world. The lost opportunities to defeat the forces of international terrorism. And especially the precious blood of our citizens who have stepped forward to serve.<br /><br />The majority of the nation no longer supports the way this war is being fought; nor does the majority of our military. We need a new direction. Not one step back from the war against international terrorism. Not a precipitous withdrawal that ignores the possibility of further chaos. But an immediate shift toward strong regionally-based diplomacy, a policy that takes our soldiers off the streets of Iraq&#39;s cities, and a formula that will in short order allow our combat forces to leave Iraq.<br /></strong><br />On both of these vital issues, our economy and our national security, it falls upon those of us in elected office to take action.<br /><br />Regarding the economic imbalance in our country, I am reminded of the situation President Theodore Roosevelt faced in the early days of the 20th century. America was then, as now, drifting apart along class lines. The so-called robber barons were unapologetically raking in a huge percentage of the national wealth. The dispossessed workers at the bottom were threatening revolt.<br /><br />Roosevelt spoke strongly against these divisions. He told his fellow Republicans that they must set themselves &quot;as resolutely against improper corporate influence on the one hand as against demagogy and mob rule on the other.&quot; And he did something about it.<br /><br />As I look at Iraq, I recall the words of former general and soon-to-be President Dwight Eisenhower during the dark days of the Korean War, which had fallen into a bloody stalemate. &quot;When comes the end?&quot; asked the General who had commanded our forces in Europe during World War Two. And as soon as he became President, he brought the Korean War to an end.<br /><br />These Presidents took the right kind of action, for the benefit of the American people and for the health of our relations around the world. Tonight we are calling on this President to take similar action, in both areas. If he does, we will join him. If he does not, we will be showing him the way.<br /><br />Thank you for listening. And God bless America.<br /><br /><br />Copyright 2007 The New York Times Company<br />Privacy Policy<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

				I highlighted in bold some statements from Virginia Democrat Senator Jim Webb, in his televised response to Bush&#39;s State of the Union address.&nbsp; I think they are particularily poignant.&nbsp; It was very interesting to me to note that Webb is a former Republican, Reagan administration, and has a son currently fighting in Iraq.<br /><br />Does anyone care to discuss the speech&#39;s last night?

				I was wondering, too.<br /><br />I caught just the last part.&nbsp; It was nice to see that subway hero guy get acknowledged.&nbsp; ABC had McCain, Clinton, and Obama giving commentary afterwards.&nbsp; I was a little distracted by other things at that point, so didn&#39;t get a chance to listen too intently.<br /><br />Bush still looks like he doesn&#39;t know what&#39;s going on.&nbsp; There is a blank look on his face often that I find disturbing.<br /><br />It sounds like he finally acknowleged the idea that alternative energy sources is a good idea.&nbsp; <br /><br />I liked Webb&#39;s/Dem&#39;s statement very much.

				Speech was fine for Bush.&nbsp; Lots of pandering for applause and looking good with dems and congress in general.&nbsp; Lots of comments about future technology saving us and helping with oil drilling in sensitive environmental areas, eletric cars and who knows what else.<br /><br />He was the personal charming Bush.&nbsp; He did talk about terrorists and the mid east being a generational war (lots of money for cheney and co., cut entitlement programs, dictatorship) and somethingh new called &quot;volunteer civilian force&quot;??? so that non miltary personal can work overseas for the war effort.&nbsp; Maybe this is a way to support the 100,000 private workers (security forces, haliburtan workers) with govt control or free funding.<br /><br />Scared the hell out of me because he made the whole thing sound possible if you buy into his world of us or them somehow centering in Iraq. No mention of taiban or afganistan.<br /><br />Jim Webb will most likely ru for president on day or much higher status in the party. Seems like a very capable tough and smart man.<br /><br />I personaly thought having the subway hero there was the worst sort of pandering. Same goes for the Guy from Africa Bush pointed to. Came here for medicine degree but Bush points out that the coach took one look at this tall guy and now he is a star NBA player.&nbsp; Yeah, thats better than being a doctor and perhaps going back to Africa and helping people.<br /><br />Can&#39;t wait to watch the next few weeks in politics.<br /><br />GO Richardson and or Edwards in &#39;08!

				<br />&quot;If nothing else, the last election proved that politics-by-slogan and poll-tested sound bites aren&#39;t going to cut it with the American people anymore, and that&#39;s why the real test of leadership is not what the President said to Congress last night, but how he works with Congress in the months to come to find real solutions to America&#39;s problems.<br /><br />The good news is that in the halls of Congress and across the nation, there is widespread support from both Democrats and Republicans on how to meet the major challenges facing America. <br /><br />Most Americans believe that escalation will not bring the war in Iraq to a responsible end, and that&#39;s why I&#39;ve proposed not just a troop cap, but a phased redeployment that will start bringing our troops home. <br /><br />Most Americans believe that energy independence will come from using more biofuels like ethanol and making cars that actually use less oil, which is why I proposed a bipartisan plan that would raise fuel economy standards for the first time in decades. <br /><br />Most Americans believe that the biggest domestic challenge facing the country is the high cost of health care, and that&#39;s why incremental plans that do nothing to bring down costs or guarantee coverage are simply no longer sufficient. We must pass universal health care for every American. <br /><br />The American people are looking for something new. They are hungry for a different kind of politics. In the last week, I&#39;ve been humbled and inspired to see more than 100,000 of you sign up to join our efforts to change the debate in this country, so that we can begin solving our common problems and pursuing our common dreams.<br /><br />Last night was an evening for rhetoric and promises. But now is the time for action - now is the time to actually get something done. &nbsp;You deserve leadership that&#39;s commensurate to the challenges we face in this country, and I look forward to working with all of you to make this happen in the days and months to come. <br /><br />Sincerely,<br />&nbsp;<br />U.S. Senator Barack Obama&quot;<br />

				Here is the transcript (http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21110566-2703,00.html) of the 2007 State of the Union Address. <br /><br />Here&#39;s your war veteran:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Tommy Rieman was a teenager pumping gas in Independence, Kentucky, when he enlisted in the United States Army. In December 2003, he was on a reconnaissance mission in Iraq when his team came under heavy enemy fire. From his Humvee, Sgt. Rieman returned fire -- and used his body as a shield to protect his gunner. He was shot in the chest and arm, and received shrapnel wounds to his legs -- yet he refused medical attention, and stayed in the fight. He helped to repel a second attack, firing grenades at the enemy&#39;s position. For his exceptional courage, Sgt. Rieman was awarded the Silver Star. And like so many other Americans who have volunteered to defend us, he has earned the respect and gratitude of our whole country.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />What did you think of Bush saying: &quot;I have the high privilege and distinct honor of my own, as the first president to begin the State of the Union message with these words: &#39;Madam Speaker.&#39;&quot;
