				I know opinions on abortion are heated, personal and religious.<br /><br />I&#039;m not trying to open up that can of worms. I&#039;ve got pretty mixed views on it myself.<br /><br />But yesterday I got a petition from MoveOn.org, a group that I believe has the best intentions but often doesn&#039;t understand what they&#039;re doing and promotes sensationalist responses to things. So when I got their announcement that there was a draft circulating that would include contraceptives, including the birth control pill, as part of the blanket term &quot;abortion&quot;, I did some research.<br /><br />I managed to find a copy of the leaked draft here. (http://www.rhrealitycheck.org/emailphotos/pdf/HHS-45-CFR.pdf)<br /><br />Upon reading it, it seems that the real issue here goes back to the pharmacists that refused to dispense birth control for their religious reasons.<br /><br />I&#039;m torn on this issue because on one hand, I do not want to force people to violate their religious beliefs. On the other hand, I&#039;m not sure that I want the people who disperse my medication to have their actions dictated by their personal beliefs above my and my doctor&#039;s choices based upon medical decisions. <br /><br />I guess what confuses me the most about this is that I&#039;m surprised there are that many people opposed to birth control and contraceptives. I know part of the problem is a reluctance to distribute the morning after pill, but the draft, were it taken as written above, would include all contraceptive devices and not just the controversial RU medicine.<br /><br />The discussion that I&#039;m curious to is how do you think we can balance these varying opinions in our country? Is there a way to protect a religious pharmacist without harming the future availability of contraceptive devices? How should we draw lines between appropriate religious refusal and a violation of the duty of one&#039;s profession? <br /><br />I guess I&#039;ve been mulling this around in my head and I was interested to see what others think.

				Personally, and this is only my opinion, if the pharmasist at a pharmacy doesn&#039;t want to fill perscriptions for birth control, then they personally shouldn&#039;t be forced to. However, I would think it ought to be up to the owner of the pharmacy to determine whether or not they want their pharmacy to be able to fill perscriptions for birth control. That way, it&#039;s an employment issue. However I&#039;d pose the typical question: you won&#039;t provide birth control, but will you provide viagra?

Or what about the HPV vaccine? Should women be unable to obtain something that could prevent cervical cancer because of a desire to prevent casual sex?<br /><br />Would a pharmacist then be required to tell you where you could get the prescription filled? What if smaller towns only had one pharmacy and the cost of filling a prescription monthly in another town was prohibitive?<br /><br />PS: I have the answer to absolutely none of these questions. I&#039;m playing a bit of &quot;devil&#039;s advocate&quot; here because I&#039;m not really sure and I think asking questions and talking to people help me figure out my own ideas.

				Another issue here is that sometimes birth control pills are prescribed for reasons unrelated to birth control = maybe to alleviate painful periods or mood swings. <br /><br />I don&#039;t think people some be forced to do something against their beliefs. However, I also think women shouldn&#039;t be denied access to birth control because of someone else&#039;s beliefs. It&#039;s a tough one. <br /><br />Maybe the answer is Planned Parenthood in every town?

I understand that there are lots of reasons to be on birth control, but I don&#039;t think it should matter why someone takes it. If you and your doctor agree that the benefits outweigh the negative risks of a medication, why should it matter which benefit of the drug you are choosing to reap? <br /><br />I do think, however, the idea of expanding Planned Parenthood wouldn&#039;t be so bad an idea.

				A dear friend of mine is a staunch catholic and vehemently anti-abortion. She does, however, believe birth control should not only be taught in schools, but be available free and on demand for anyone who wants it, espcially teens.&nbsp; I&#039;m staunchly pro-choice and maybe she&#039;s the only one, but we both agree that there will be fewer abortions if you EDUCATE! Living in teh dark ages is not the answer. <br /><br />And as for pharmacists? YOU FILL MY DAMN PRESCRIPTION. If you dont like me taking it, TOO BAD. find another job.&nbsp; They are ethically obligated to follow the doctors orders.&nbsp; no ifs ands or buts. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

It&#039;s not up to the pharmacist to decide what prescriptions people are allowed to fill based on their moral beliefs. People are free to believe whatever they want, but holding your moral beliefs over someone&#039;s health when you don&#039;t even know them, even over their own doctor&#039;s orders, is an abuse of power. If pharmacists are allowed to do this, any drugs that are threatened to be more difficult to get should then be made easier to get outside of a pharmacy. Perhaps pharmacies whose prescription-filling policies are guided by religious beliefs should be called something other than pharmacies. The distinction should be clear somehow on the outside.<br /><br />duska, I don&#039;t think viagra is related to the birth control argument. Viagra can presumably be used to encourage sex for the purpose of having babies, whereas the assumption is that birth control pills allow women to have sex where babies are not the intended outcome.

I don&#039;t think any employer should force an employee to do something that they hold against their beliefs, but the pharmacy issue falls under this category too.

I&#039;ve never looked very thoroughly, but I have yet to find any organization that doesn&#039;t seem to be selling their shock therapy as hard as the damn religious right in some cases. What especially bothers me is the way they respond directly to &#039;attacks&#039; from the opposing side. For example, the religious right did some campaign in which they protested outside a bunch of clinics for 40 days and 40 nights straight. Planned Parenthood responded to this by launching a blog, Emily X, which chronicled the horrifying things the protesters did to this person. It was supposed to be completely anonymous, yet if memory serves, it seemed that it could have been several different people&#039;s experiences. Overall it was just kind of like &#039;you guys are almost as bad as them you know&#039; in my head. <br />I should mention that the fact that I am pro-choice leads me to not listen or pay any attention to the opposing arguments until a flag goes up that they might be getting somewhere in the law.

You can sell condoms to women, too.<br /><br />The problem is that the new definition of abortion includes birth control because it interferes with a zygote. Condoms wouldn&#039;t be included in the new language because they keep sperm and egg separate.<br /><br />The issue is that the new language that has been proposed says that anything, ANYTHING getting in the way of a zygote coming to full term and being born is abortion.<br /><br />This isn&#039;t outlawing abortion, obviously, but putting them in the same classification.<br /><br />The problem with this modification of the code of language is that eventually you have to ask if a doctor can refuse to treat a woman who&#039;s pregnant *AND* sick, if the drugs could terminate her pregnancy? Can her healthcare company refuse to pay for such drugs/treatment? <br /><br />If medical experts are allowed to refuse anything classified as &quot;abortion&quot;, what happens to the pregnant woman in a car accident who needs the pregnancy terminated to save her life? Can an EMS guy refuse based on moral grounds? If the definition is changed, he can.<br /><br />It seems like a big thumbs-up to such refusals, which would endanger the lives of any woman who *dared* to become pregnant, whether she wanted to carry the baby to term or not.

				<em>The problem is that the new definition of abortion includes birth control because it interferes with a zygote. Condoms wouldn&#039;t be included in the new language because they keep sperm and egg separate.<br /><br />The issue is that the new language that has been proposed says that anything, ANYTHING getting in the way of a zygote coming to full term and being born is abortion.</em><br /><br /><br />But combined hormone birth control pills also keep the sperm and egg separate by suppressing ovulation. &nbsp;And progestin only pills also suppress ovulation, but just not as reliably as the combined hormone pill. &nbsp;And even then, progestin pills thicken the mucous around the cervix and preventing sperm from entering the uterus. &nbsp;<br /><br />So really, there is no interfering going on; seems to be a horrible lack of medical knowledge there of those who are attempting to re-define.

				That definition of abortion proposed is incredibly scary, and is broad enough to include practically anything. &nbsp;That does include birth control pills and by that same token, it would include condoms. &nbsp;And yes, there are pharmacies across the US that are refusing to sell condoms and any type of contraception, even in their entire store. &nbsp;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/15/AR2008061502180.html?hpid=moreheadlines<br /><br />I think it&#039;s important to note that these proposed rules apply not only to pharmacists, but anyone, including doctors and nurses, who are asked to perform or assist in procedures to which they have a religious objection. &nbsp;This would presumably include not only abortions, but blood transfusions, doctor&#039;s prescriptions, referrals, and even advice on any medical problem. &nbsp;This can also lead to the refusal to prescribe or dispense the morning after pill to rape victims. &nbsp;We are lucky enough to live in an area of the US where there are many drug stores and medical facilities.&nbsp; If denied, you can always see someone else. &nbsp;But in much of the rural America, drug stores and medical facilities are sparse. &nbsp;In fact, in Mississippi, there is only one abortion clinic in the entire state. &nbsp;In some parts of America, an individual (whether doctor, nurse, or pharmacist) who refuses to perform a function which they object to, is potentially denying that person of a medical necessity, and could result in serious harm to the patient, including death. &nbsp;

				From a philosophical standpoint, it depends on whether we think of pharmacists as merchants or as people performing some sort of civil service. If they are considered merchants, just like the convenience store or McDonald&#039;s, they are entitled to dispense whatever prescriptions they wish. If they are considered to perform a civil service, they shouldn&#039;t have that sort of freedom. It would be like a cop arresting someone for something that they think is wrong but isn&#039;t against the law, or a hospital refusing to treat someone they dislike for whatever reason. Since we&#039;re dealing with people&#039;s health, I tend to think the pharmacist should not have the right to determine what prescriptions they will fill from a moral standpoint. <br /><br />I&#039;ve seen the economic standpoint in action when it came to my mom&#039;s cancer treatment. None of the big chain pharmacies were willing to fill one prescription she needed for a drug to boost her white blood cell count. This was because it cost $1500. Even though she had a letter from the insurance company guaranteeing coverage, the drugs stores wouldn&#039;t do it. It was a struggle for her to find a place that would dispense it. I don&#039;t know what she would&#039;ve done if she couldn&#039;t find anyone to fill it. I thought that was wrong, too, by the way.

It says that any entity receiving federal funds can not discriminate against a health care provider because that health care provider refuses to perform certain services that they find morally objectionable. More to the point, it just reinforces the current law by attempting to establish reporting guidelines to ensure that the law is being followed.

Sort of related, what about the cab drivers in Minnesota (http://abcnews.go.com/international/Story?id=2827800&amp;page=1) who refuse to allow people carrying alcohol into their cabs because of their religious beliefs? These drivers go to the airport but refuse passengers who have wine or liquor from the duty-free store. Their religious beliefs tell them the transport of alcohol is a sin. But a cab could rightly be considered a civil service rather than a merchant with the rights to sell what he or she wants. <br /><br />I&#039;m all for the right to believe whatever you believe, but not to enforce it on others, including through your job. <br /><br />If a pharmacist is an employee of a pharmacy which carries birth control and is licensed by the state, in my view, they are in fact morally obligated to fill any valid prescription even if it violates their religious beliefs. Likewise, a pharmacy owner is free to refuse to stock, carry, or order birth control or any other medication he or she finds objectionable--and I am free to take my business elsewhere. <br /><br />The argument of &quot;what if you&#039;re in a small town and can&#039;t get it anywhere else&quot; hold little water with me. I&#039;m from one of those small towns, and it&#039;s not really true. There might be only one pharmacy in town (as there was in mine), but there&#039;s probably one within an hour&#039;s drive, and the internet actually does reach most of the country. In a town small enough, you&#039;d rather drive an hour than see someone you know in the pharmacy anyway.

In my small town, the pharmacy was privately-owned, so there was definitely the risk that they could decide what to sell and to whom. I have to hope that most national chains would let go of moral considerations since they&#039;re in it for profit, but chains like Chik-Fil-A demonstrate that even hugely-grossing businesses will continue to hold to certain ethics of the owner/founder. (For those who don&#039;t know, Chik-Fil-A is a regional chain restaurant that is closed on Sundays.)<br /><br />I think the bigger problem at this point is not the threat of chain pharmacies deciding not to carry the pills, but of individual pharmacists using their religious views as an excuse not to do their jobs. Perhaps all pharmacies should require applying pharmacists to agree to fill any valid prescription, or state that they have a religious objection and then require that they share shifts with pharmacists who WILL fill the prescriptions. If the pharmacy does not always have two pharmacists on duty, it would require an extra expenditure on their part, and they might decline to hire a pharmacist who would act this way, thereby weeding out the ones who refuse to fill the prescriptions. This is a dangerous ground, too, as it might become religious persecution of a sort. I was raised in a religion in which the believers keep the Jewish Sabbath and do not work from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday. I got passed over for waitressing jobs as a teen and I felt it was unfair, but I was essentially refusing to work the busiest shifts and my prospective employers had the right to decide not to hire me at all. I was not being prevented from working entirely, it was just harder to find a job.

				That&#039;s part of the problem too.&nbsp; $60 a month is a lot for some people, especially when you have a family already and don&#039;t get paid that much.&nbsp; And also, I think to drive an hour away to fill a prescription is a crazy thing to have to do, because the one in your town refuses to fill it.&nbsp; That&#039;s a two hour commitment, time away from work, and a lot in gas money.&nbsp; Someone in a small town shouldn&#039;t have to go through all that to get their doctor prescribed medications filled.&nbsp; I would hope that the internet was readily accessible everywhere and that they would accept all prescriptions to be filled, even without insurance.&nbsp; But I&#039;m not so sure this is true in poorer, and more isolated areas of the US.

				I recently asked my pharmacy for the retail price of my pills. &nbsp;They&#039;re $38, which is admittedly not too bad (with coverage I pay $10), but then again those are the generics of a pill that&#039;s been around for a while - also a pill that a lot of women can&#039;t take because of their sensitivities to the dosage of hormones.<br /><br />I bet I could get a better retail price from either CostCo, online or maybe even Walmart. &nbsp;But somewhat affordable pills is still no excuse for them not being covered. &nbsp;<br />

				Yes, you can buy prescription meds from drugstore.com without insurance.&nbsp; It&#039;s actually a little easier too.&nbsp; I just signed up with them because RiteAide doesn&#039;t carry one of my meds anymore.&nbsp; Getting my insurance set up was kind of a pain.&nbsp; Also, on the website they tell you how much you&#039;re saving.&nbsp; And if you buy in bulk (if your script allows) it&#039;s cheaper.

				To be honest, I’m still working this issue out in my head and I’m very much ambivalent holding doctors to a professional standard where they would be required to out surgical abortions, especially when doing so puts their lives in danger from anti-abortion extremists. So, though I realize it is contradictory to what I’m saying, my answer at this point is no, doctors should not be required to carry out abortions.<br /><br />When I said devices and procedures I had IUDs and morning-after pills in mind because many who hold anti-abortion views consider them to be the equivalent of a surgical abortion.<br /><br />The point I was trying to make was that if a pharmacist or another kind of healthcare provider holds an orthodox view and practice of their religion, one that governs their professional conduct and decisions, and the state sets rules that regulates this profession and then allows conduct that conflicts with regulations, doesn’t this tacitly establish a state religion – at least in terms of healthcare? <br /><br />A pharmacist does not only sell drugs. He or she also dispenses medical advice, offers opinion, and can make medical decisions that affect their customer’s lives that, to me, this distinguishes a pharmacist from any other merchant. <br /><br />In a big city we have choices, so accommodation for individuals who hold strong religious beliefs can be made more easily. Going cross-town is probably not an inconvenience for most but what happens when someone has to go cross state or to another state to get the healthcare services they need. I feel this is just too great a burden and just wrong. In the future, will some people have to ‘repent’ before getting the care they need?&nbsp; <br /><br />If pharmacists are given a pass should we also let off other professionals? Can a science teacher opt out of a lesson of evolution? Can a history teacher skip the holocaust because he or she doubts its authenticity? Can judges be allowed to decide cases based on the ten commandments or Sharia law?<br /><br />(I may be wrong but I don’t think the testing of beauty products on animals rated too highly in the doctrines of most major religions so I don’t think the comparison is apt.)<br />

				I want to thank everyone for the interesting and very civil discussion going on!<br /><br />I do not think that anyone in any job should be forced to do something he or she would be uncomfortable with, whether it&#039;s because of religious beliefs or otherwise. However, I also do not think that any individual should have the power to enforce his or her religious beliefs on another individual through the withholding or refusing of products or services. So I think pharmacists and cab drivers should be given a choice--either you fill all prescriptions or only work shifts with a pharmacist who will, perhaps taking a pay cut if the pharmacy would not normally have two pharmacists on the clock at the same time. You take passengers and all their belongings, or you don&#039;t wait in line at the airport. <br /><br />I think it&#039;s a dangerous precedent that we would allow certain sectors of the community to refuse service/products because they perceive it as a &quot;sin&quot; (thereby judging the consumer). It could allow the creation of a nanny state which decides who gets what and why. <br /><br />On the other hand, requiring someone to break their religious vows because of their job is also unfair. It could set the precedent for a state of non-religion, which does not jive with freedom of religion. It could turn into a situation where pharmacies will not hire Catholics, and that&#039;s discrimination. While I personally prefer that people leave their religion at home, I try to be accomodating as long as it isn&#039;t infringing on my life. People can judge, but they can&#039;t use their judgment to prevent me from living my life as I see fit. <br /><br />Basically, it&#039;s a really sticky situation and I&#039;m glad I don&#039;t have to be the one to solve the problem. If I were ever faced with a pharmacist who refused to sell me birth control pills, I would take my business elsewhere and make sure EVERYONE knew why. Sometimes the simplest solution to problems that affect the public gets voted in by the dollar.

A doctor could refuse to assist anyone who takes birth control under this expanded definition, if they wanted to. A health insurance company could deny antibiotics or chemotherapy to a sick pregnant woman if they wanted to.<br /><br />I am not so much worried about doctors refusing--I don&#039;t think the kind of doctor you want to go to would do that in the first place--but what about health insurance companies using this new expanded definition to allow them to cut corners and deny expensive procedures on women who are pregnant, regardless of their intentions to keep or not keep the baby.<br /><br />There are already provisions to keep doctors, nurses, anesthesiologists and any kind of health care professional from being forced into participating in surgically opted abortions. I in no way think they should be forced to perform surgical abortions. I think that a medical professional should be able to chose their field and no one is getting sent to put in their 6 hours at the abortion clinic. It doesn&#039;t work like that.<br /><br />The problem is when &quot;abortion&quot; is expanded to include *ANYTHING* that could disrupt the pregnancy, either before or after implantation, it expands to include birth control pills, the morning after pill, possibly diet, smoking and drinking and, if you&#039;re pregnant, almost *any* medical treatment for serious illnesses (bacterial infections, broken bones, cancer) runs a risk of terminating the pregnancy. What would healthcare for a pregnant woman look like if her doctor, pharmacist, and, most importantly, insurance company, could deny her almost any kind of services because there is a risk of terminating the pregnancy?<br /><br />I guess it just seems to me that the idea of changing this definition is a pretty big thumbs up to insurance companies to cut corners on health care and for pharmacists to dictate what prescriptions they will or will not fill.<br /><br /><br />Also, like purplecurlygirl said, I think it&#039;s pretty awesome that we&#039;re having this discussion without any whack or immature comments.

				Not quite the same issue, but this reminded me of a conversation I had with a guy in med school. One of his fellow students was a conservative Christian, and said that if a patient of another faith was dying and requested a cleric of another faith, he would deny the request and call a minister that he (the doctor) approved of instead. <br /><br />I&#039;m not trying to hijack the thread, I just think it&#039;s useful to look at other examples where a person&#039;s faith affects the people they work for/with. <br /><br />===========================================================================================<br /><br />Oh my god. I just started to post and then saw Sweeper&#039;s post. I had completely forgotten this, but at least some birth control pills can be used to induce abortion. I was dating this med student, and he was studying, and he started telling me about it. You have to take a different dosages over a period of several days, and you have to know what you&#039;re doing. If abortion were successfully outlawed, or just inaccessible in a certain area, birth control pills could be a way around that. They&#039;re trying to close the loop. <br /><br />OK, maybe that&#039;s a little paranoid. But still.

This is&nbsp; at the crux of many socio-economic&nbsp; problems. One of the few things I agree with my left-leaning opponents is&nbsp; that abortion, as a&nbsp; last resort, should&nbsp; be legally available&nbsp; and even &#039;funded&#039; for people&nbsp; who can&#039;t afford it.&nbsp; I do, however,&nbsp; think partial birth&nbsp; &nbsp;abortion should remain illegal. Roe VS&nbsp; Wade&nbsp; was another&nbsp; &#039;legislating from the bench&#039; problem. But, the truth is&nbsp; even if it went back to the states, it would still be basically&nbsp; legal&nbsp; in most of&nbsp; them. It is&nbsp; an awful thing, terminating a&nbsp; life, let&#039;s&nbsp; be honest, that&#039;s exactly what it is, but, quality of&nbsp; life is also&nbsp; just an important.

				The problem with this whole &quot;making everything an abortion&quot; is that it also impinges on medical treatments for conditions other than pregnancy.<br /><br />Case in point:&nbsp; In Kansas, for a while, EVERY D&amp;C was reported to the state.&nbsp; Now, a D&amp;C (dilation and cutterage--scraping out the lining of the uterus) can be used for LOTS of things, including a diagnostic biopsy, to cure uterine polyps, and to contain general bleeding.&nbsp; <br /><br />I know, because I&#039;m home recovering from one that I had to get done.&nbsp; Thank goodness the path reports came back cancer-free but I may need another one for more polyps.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now, what if I lived in the ass end of nowhere and some doctor thought that nobody should get one because it MAY be for abortive reasons?&nbsp; Even if a pregnancy test showed up negative, there have been doctors that have gone on the record saying that ALL midcycle bleeding is psychosomatic (yeah, I guess my anemia from bleeding for almost two months was psychosomatic also, and the polyps they took out).&nbsp; And no, a D&amp;C is not the kind of flip decision that one makes on a whim, and schedules in between a manicure and pedicure.&nbsp; It is an invasive procedure that requires follow-up and a trained practitioner.&nbsp; <br /><br />IUDs are also frequently perscribed for bleeding due to a number of conditions. So are birth control pills.&nbsp; Many many women with these issues have to go through a series of staged treatments..ie BC pills, and if that doesn&#039;t work then a D&amp;C, and if that doesn&#039;t work&nbsp; an IUD or ablation.<br /><br />The bottom line is that the anti-choice movement is all about legislating morality and punishing women, whenever possible, for expressing their sexuality.&nbsp; This extends to limiting all reproductive health options and education--show me one pro-choice pro-abstinence-movement teacher. <br /><br />NO anti-choice groups ever want to see more contraception.&nbsp; They just have an abiding and lasting hatred of other people choosing for themselves something that they object to.&nbsp;

I guess not anymore. <br />Are you sure that &quot;NO anti-choice groups ever want to see more contraceptives&quot;? And is it even conceivable that maybe intelligent people could differ on when life begins?

I think the point she was trying to make, (the way I took her statement anyway) was that just because there are people who believe any form of abortion is wrong, and that children shouldn&#039;t be taught sex ed, etc. that it doesn&#039;t make it right for those services to be made unavailable, because inevitably, there are circumstances under which people will get screwed. For example, if they expand the rules to forbid any scraping of the inside of the uterus, then women who have ailments completely unrelated to child-bearing, but in need of that type of treatment, will be assed out because they cannot get proper medical treatment. (ok she said it a lot smarter sounding but I think everyone understands my meaning)

				The reason that you don&#039;t often hear about pharmacies refusing to sell people condoms is because even if they do, it&#039;s not that big of a deal. The gas station or any convenience store carries them. <br /><br />However, you can&#039;t get birth control pills from just anywhere. They have to be filled at a pharmacy. Hence pharmacists have <strong>significant</strong> distribution power. Saying that you can just go to the next town over is highly flawed as in a lot of states in the bible belt you would find far more pharmacies with anti-birth control policies than not. <br /><br />But yes, in general, the religious right is against condoms, birth control and safe sex. Those things are wrong based on their <strong>religious</strong> beliefs and they do try to push their religious beliefs and morals on children in schools and other people.<br /><br />You have to realize that the majority of the country is not like the north/northeast/California. In Florida they&#039;re still fighting against teaching evolution in schools and Florida is considered one of the more &quot;northernized&quot; of the southern states.<br /><br />This is another attempt by the religious right to enforce their religious and/or moral beliefs on others based on what <strong>they</strong> think is right.
