				OK, I know&nbsp; people are already rolling their&nbsp; eyes, here comes&nbsp; this&nbsp; &#039;right-wing&#039;&nbsp; guy now &#039;dumping&#039; on the &#039;homeless.&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s not&nbsp; true.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am talking about a different set of people.&nbsp; It is not my intention and I would never hurt anyones family who were in such hard times. I don&#039;t want to&nbsp; talk about myself and&nbsp; my philanthropic &#039;charity&#039; events, but, I do spend a good part of what&nbsp; free time I have, contributing time and what little&nbsp; money I have going to events helping poor children who are ill and for mentally and physically disabled Veterans and others. I also spend many a holiday season going to VA hospitals and Childrens Hospitals, and even worked&nbsp; in&nbsp; pantry. I&#039;m not writing this to show what a &#039;great guy&#039; I am, but, that my intention and anger was directed to those who would abuse the system doing so much for people. Also, I was jobless and homeless ,I lived out of a Van for a year in a dead end warehouse area, far from people cause it was EMBARRASSING and didn&#039;t want to go home to my parents. So, I&#039;m not unsympathetic, but, this is quite&nbsp; different.<br /><br />On Tuesday, this&nbsp; week, after working a 17 hour day, I feel asleep, only to awakening to a&nbsp; drunken, disorderly crowd outside&nbsp; a few hours later. I see these guys roaming the neighborhood and I give them cans&nbsp; and bottles on occasion, they have shopping carts.&nbsp; This morning they had congregrated outside my home by the tree, but, one of them I didn&#039;t recognise. Since, I had to go to work in about an hour, and having any contact with these guys&nbsp; could become involved, I ignored it and went about my business. At NOON, fully 4 hours after I had left the house, I came back, only to find the two had become 4 and one was streched out on the sidewalk. I went over and told them to please pick up the bottles and trash and leave. Three&nbsp; complied and started to get going, the one guy lying on the ground in his own feces and urine,suddenly&nbsp; became a sidewalk &#039;Thomas Jefferson&#039; and started yelling about his &#039;rights&#039; to be on the sidewalk. Told me &#039;F. U&#039; and&nbsp; was lying in the thin strip&nbsp; of&nbsp; sidewalk between driveways, where&nbsp; I have&nbsp; to get my van out.&nbsp; Now, no doubt&nbsp; thanks to the&nbsp; organizations like the ACLU, this&nbsp; lunatic&nbsp; probably would end up on page one of newspaper and I would be arrested,If anything happened, and G-D forbid&nbsp; you didn&#039;t&nbsp; see him some&nbsp; morning and backed up. So, I called an ambulance and the cops also&nbsp; came, tried to talk to this person to move, whereupon he&nbsp; feigned &#039;No Comprende&#039;, all of a sudden he spoke no English. :roll: Eventually, the ambulance people&nbsp; delicately lifted him up and he was taken to a Hospital, and I was questioned, cause he claimed to them that&nbsp; I KICKED HIM?! I DID NOT touch this person, first, he was filthy, second, I don&#039;t hit people lying on the ground. Anyway, he was taken away, and I was left with the cans and bottles and potato chips wrappers to clean up. I have unfortunately, over the past several years&nbsp; been ticketed&nbsp; for debris left behind&nbsp; by these&nbsp; guys.<br /><br />Now, my question is&nbsp; this, what can be done&nbsp; about these people, besides&nbsp; calling ambulances and cops? I saw this&nbsp; guy tonight, the abusive guy, with other&nbsp; guys with shopping carts at&nbsp; Ditmars and 31st, by the train. He was&nbsp; yelling and even these&nbsp; homeless guys looked&nbsp; &#039;threatened.&#039;&nbsp; It&#039;s&nbsp; an ongoing problem and it&#039;s&nbsp; getting worse in&nbsp; Astoria not better, I think these&nbsp; guys&nbsp; are from outside the community. What can be done? Thanks.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

				I used to work in the city, and would end up taking the (E) home most nights. On a number of occasions I&#039;ve had drunk, homeless people draw their arm back as if their going to hit me. Now I am very confrontational so I tell them in a not very calm voice that if he&#039;d like to take a shot to do it. Now of course they never do, albeit the day they do you can believe I will fight them back. The way I think about it, once in a rational state of mind is that these people have nothing. Theres a reason they have nothing, whether it&#039;s mental illness, laziness, addiction, or just poor luck. So whenever I deal with them I have to take that all into consideration. In your case, if they congregate like that again and are making a ruckus, call the police. Loitering is a crime!

				I&#039;ve been wondering if anyone else has noticed a particular guy. I assume he&#039;s homeless, though he&#039;s usually fairly well groomed. I&#039;ve seen him in Astoria Park, on Ditmars, on 23rd street. The last couple of times I was walking with other moms, and they were as nervous as I was: the guy mutters (and occasionally shouts) a constant string of... something. I try not to get close enough to place the exact words. He could have turrett&#039;s (spelling) syndrome and be a dues paid contributing member of society for all I know. But he makes me really deeply uncomfortable. I only noticed him maybe a month ago, and it wasn&#039;t until the 4th or 5th time I saw him that I realized he was muttering *every* time I saw him, and he didn&#039;t have a cell phone to mutter into.<br /><br />He&#039;s always moving quickly, I wouldn&#039;t call the cops on him for loitering and I only feel menaced because his behavior is unusual. He&#039;s not raised a hand in anger (despite my over-exhuberent toddler almost pushing the stroller into him one afternoon), and I can&#039;t tell if my spidey senses (and, to be fair, the other two moms&#039;) are tingling for good reason or not.<br /><br />I guess no harm no foul, but I know I felt better with my own discomfort once I knew I wasn&#039;t the only one having it. If anyone else recognizes the guy (tall, dark, shaved head) and feel nervous-- hey, you&#039;re not alone. :) Maybe we can start a Nervous Citizens club and be nervous together. ;)<br /><br />alia<br />ps: and since it seems the thing to do, my sensitivity cred is my family spent a summer homeless when I was 12 and i spent one christmas vacation volunteering at an emergency homeless shelter and even spent some memorable months temping at a mental hospital. i like to think my spidey senses are uniquely honed.

				Alia, I&#039;d sign up for your &quot;Nervous Person Club.&quot;&nbsp; There is a particular homeless man who I see around my neighborhood (32nd and Broadway) quite often, and lately, he&#039;s been sleeping and eating in the doorstep of some kind of workshop which is right near my apartment building.&nbsp; He has a semipermanent setup with a sleeping mat and pillow which he leaves there during the day when he wanders elsewhere.&nbsp; He leaves his chicken bones and fried rice all over the ground.&nbsp; And on Saturday, there was a homeless man with a suitcase and the stench of stale urine sitting in the lobby of my building.&nbsp; Not sure how he got in there, but the outside door is supposed to be locked.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t help but wonder if he is friends with the guy I see all the time.<br /><br />I think that FZ did the right thing by calling the authorities on this man to put him in contact with the system.&nbsp; We all have sympathies for the homeless, but this city has the most generous and best shelter and support system in the country.&nbsp; There is no reason for anyone to be in the streets.&nbsp; Most of my friends who work or have worked for the Department of Homeless Services here in NYC tell me that by giving money to the street homeless, or otherwise supporting them, we are preventing them from making contact with the system where they can get the real help they need.&nbsp; It&#039;s true that most street homeless are not between jobs or down on their luck, but suffer from chronic mental illness or substance abuse, and need help that they can&#039;t get on the streets.

				Alia, I saw that guy once about 2 weeks agoon 23rd ave, he was wearing a nice looking sports coat with some jeans. Def a head case. He mutters as he is looking at people, so i said to him &quot;excuse me?&quot; but he kept walking. I could hear him from a block away.

				I was over by washington square park the other night, standing on the curb, waiting for the light to change, and this guy walked up to me and said, &quot;excuse me.&quot; (Not &quot;excuse me?&quot; but &quot;EXCUSE me!&quot;) He was way too close and aggressive and I was so uncomfortable and so anxious to get the hell away from him that I stepped out into the street in front of a taxi. Happily I didn&#039;t get hit but this seemed to please weird guy. He yelled at me until I was out of earshot. &quot;Yeah! See what happens? SEE!? You get hit by a car! yeah!&quot;<br /><br />It was weird. Most of the homeless people encounter aren&#039;t so aggressive.

				Although I agree that homeless shouldnt be forced to live in &quot;the system&quot;, as a law-abiding tax payer, I shouldnt be forced to walk by piles of trash/boxes/shopping carts/chairs/refrigerators/clothes on my way to the subway. There is a growing colony of them on the ditmars side and if they don&#039;t have respect for the streets of the neighborhood, then they shouldnt be granted the freedom to be on it.

Letting it go, breeds&nbsp; crime as well, and I have seen &#039;healthier&#039; guys&nbsp; hanging with&nbsp; the &quot;drunks&quot; and they get into fights. Plus, when&nbsp; you are gone all day, these&nbsp; guys&nbsp; get into yards and in&nbsp; one case&nbsp; across&nbsp; the street&nbsp; from me, the neighbor caught one guy, defacating&nbsp; in his yard.

				Have you been reading this thread? They sh!t in peoples yards, they harass people walking by. This morning there were a ton of broken beer bottles, cans, garbage. I have seen condoms right under the 31st street train tracks by ditmars, right where they hang out. . As for people behaving like this on occasion, its def possible, but on a daily basis, it is inexcusable. I have witnessed these same people roaming the area collecting cans, not to put food on the table, but to buy Steel Reserve tall boys and p!ss on my streets. This is not the behavior of insane people. If I&#039;m being self righteous, then so be it.

				I do have to say the Ditmars area has a large amount of homeless people by the train.&nbsp; And it&#039;s been increasing in the last 5 years.&nbsp; It&#039;s not pleasant to have to deal with the littering, public drunkeness, and especially issues to do with public safety.&nbsp; And that&#039;s not even on the train itself.&nbsp; The train is just as bad though, or even worse.&nbsp; There are always at least 1-3 cars with homeless sleeping in them at Ditmars, and the entire car reeks. Then there are the ones who literally piss or poop their pants and stink up the cars that way.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had to switch cars over it.&nbsp; Not to mention the ones that yell, get violent and definitely have something mentally wrong with them.&nbsp; This area has more than it&#039;s share of people with mental problems on the street.&nbsp; We don&#039;t have squatters and rich kids with trust funds living on Ditmars.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have any easy answers but these people do need help and they&#039;re not going to get it on the street.

				I think the recent uptick in vagrant behavior mentioned around Ditmars stop has to do with that scaffolding under Hell Gate at 31st Street. It&#039;s dark, dank and hidden from view, which I&#039;m sure makes it ideal for less than acceptable behavior.<br /><br />Maybe Vallone or someone can get whoever&#039;s doing the construction work to step it up and finish it already.<br /><br />There are definitely newer faces around the intersection and my take is that there will always be homeless around (why some choose this particular neighborhood to loiter in I don&#039;t know -- maybe b/c it&#039;s safer?). There were a couple of regulars I don&#039;t see anymore... Jail, institution, death. Something claims them eventually, some sooner than others. So it&#039;s likely that this recent group will go away, and be replaced by someone else.<br /><br />But when one of them gets potentially dangerous, then the police need to be notified. Immediately and frequently. And if anyone really feels threatened, change your route. If that&#039;s not possible and you really feel in danger, go and get yourself some mace and learn how to properly use it (I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039; s legal here.) And take a self-defense class. A good one will teach you how to first avoid a potentially dangerous situation, not kick someone&#039;s ass.<br /><br />As for homeless sleeping in subway cars and stinking it up, well that&#039;s just an unfortunate fact of life in the city, too. I actually believe there&#039;s been <em>less</em> of that than in recent years. Even in winter.

				Yesterday, in the Brooklen Bagel on Ditmars, I saw a sign about an Emergency Meeting this Thursday night. (Time and place escapes me, sorry!)

				Good to know, alia. Btw, i have seen that guy you mentioned earlier in the thread on almost a regular basis. Went for a jog on Thursday and saturday down 23rd to the park, and both times ran into muttering guy walking away from the park at almost the exact same spot.

				Alia,<br />If you see any more info in your area about the emergency meeting, please let me know.&nbsp; I have been thinking about taking some sort of action if no one else does.&nbsp; But I don&#039;t know what course to take. I can&#039;t speak in terms of statistics, but anecdotally, there seems to be an increased presence of street homeless in this area.&nbsp; There is constantly a very stinky panhandler present at the Broadway N/W station on the stairs.&nbsp; I can smell him when getting off the train as soon as I get to the token booth.&nbsp; And there is that guy with the dreadlocks who is usually passed out in the doorway by my apartment and leaves his food and other filth there when he goes to wander the neighborhood.&nbsp; There are people who hang out by the fruit market diagonally across from Gilbey&#039;s.&nbsp; I have seen them harass Gilbey&#039;s patrons, and the bouncer rebuked them and told them to go back to their own corner.&nbsp; And the man who was hanging out in the vestibule of my building.&nbsp; Most disturbingly, I am starting to see human excrement by the side of the bank on the corner of 32nd and Broadway.&nbsp; Also, general vagrancy type behavior.&nbsp; On Monday, I saw a man who was apparently not homeless passed out in front of Tacos Mexico at 2 PM.&nbsp; This is to say nothing of the homeless congregations in the Ditmars area.&nbsp; Some of them reminded me of people you&#039;d see on the streets of Portland or Seattle.&nbsp; I am a firm believer that these kinds of behaviors lead to the public perception that greater crimes will be accepted.&nbsp; Someone needs to do something about this.

				Hi Cadillac Man,<br />I hope you are doing well out there.&nbsp; No intended disrespect for your situation, and I don&#039;t mean to equate being without a home or being out of luck with general vagrancy behavior.&nbsp; But the excrement in the streets on the part of whoever is doing it has got to stop.&nbsp; That sort of stuff cannot stand whether it is being done by people who are without a home in the technical sense, or not.&nbsp; I think what is going on in Skid Row in Los Angeles is very instructive.&nbsp; There are plenty of folks there who are &quot;down and out&quot; and are getting help for alcoholism, drug addictions, etc.&nbsp; But they get a bad name from people who set up street encampments basically to use as a heroin shooting gallery.&nbsp; They terrorize the community (to a much greater extent than the people under the viaduct), and again, they distract from the attention which should go to people who need and would accept help.&nbsp; I don&#039;t ever want this area to become like Skid Row, or like San Francisco.&nbsp; I just sent an e-mail to Vallone myself.&nbsp; I hope to hear back from his office.

				I vacationed in San Francisco the Labor Day weekend before 9/11/01, and remember being struck at the high number of homeless on the streets.&nbsp; They hung out in groups and were everywhere.&nbsp; The panhandling was very aggressive.&nbsp; I was told that the homeless were actually bused out of Oakland and outlying areas into San Fran, because of the amount of homeless services there.&nbsp; I went home thinking NYC&#039;s not like this.&nbsp; Well, since 9/11, I&#039;ve seen the amount of homeless increase here.&nbsp; It may not be at the levels of San Fran, but it&#039;s getting close.&nbsp; I recently saw a similar problem in Ottawa, Canada but it is mostly punk kids there, where as here it&#039;s a lot of mentally ill on the street, homeless or not.&nbsp; I went into Manhattan by Times Square this past Saturday and there was a man pooping into the grates on the sidewalk.&nbsp; I had my 6 year old niece and my parents with me from out of town.&nbsp; It was disgusting and I&#039;m sorry they had to see that.

				I didn&#039;t know where else to put this post, but given that this thread seems to be discussing the general topic of the homeless, I thought it should be here.&nbsp; Feel free to move it. <br /><br />There was a sad story in the NY Times about a homeless man in Spanish Harlem who was set on fire and ultimately died because of his injuries.&nbsp; Instead of focusing on the heinous nature of the crime, which was committed by a man whose father is in a shelter, the article details the relationship that the man had with an elderly woman from the neighborhood.<br /><br />http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/17/nyregion/17about.html?_r=1&amp;ref=nyregion&amp;oref=slogin<br /><br />By telling the story of one individual, the article personalizes the plight of many of the people who, for whatever reason, are homeless.&nbsp; Unfortunately, because of their actions, we tend to focus on the abusive and dangerous homeless as opposed to those who live in silence around us.
