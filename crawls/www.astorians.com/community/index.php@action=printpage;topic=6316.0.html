				So I want to get a tattoo in a couple of weeks and I&#039;d like to find an artist in the neighborhood instead of going back to Manhattan (where I got my last one) or to Brooklyn (where most of my friends get theres). Any recommendations?

				Fat Cat Tattoos has a really good reputation.&nbsp; I&#039;m not certain who is working there anymore, but a friend of mine made a trip all the way from Syracuse to go there for a tattoo.&nbsp; I could be mistaken, but I think that they&#039;re the only shop in Astoria.<br />http://www.fatcattattoos.com/shop.html<br />For artists, I find it best to check out a tattoo artists book to see if I want him or her to permanently etch something into my skin (and I&#039;ve let a few people do just that).

				yes, i too would suggest looking at the artist&#039;s book before getting anything.&nbsp; many artists are good at one style but other styles...not so much. <br /><br />I would not limit yourself to the neighborhood, that might be doing yourself a disservice.&nbsp; You might want to consider going to the annual NYC Tattoo convention this upcoming weekend at Roseland.&nbsp; There are tons of artists from all over the world and you can look at all of the portfolios before choosing an artist.&nbsp; I think that the personalities of both the artist and the &quot;tattooee&quot; are very important.&nbsp; You will end up with a better design if you can communicate with each other well.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				Thanks for the advice guys. I wish I was going to be in town this weekend, or I would totally go check out the con. <br /><br />I definitely wanted to meet the artist first and work out the design...but like my other tattoo, the one I want is not terribly complex...just text and a simple design (though I imagine it will be more complex than my first tattoo since all he had to do was trace the design I brought him). It took maybe half an hour, as opposed to complex, multi-hour, multi-session tattoos I&#039;ve witnessed.

				How do you think fat cat holds up if it&#039;s not original art. i have the graphic i want, i just have to do it. and i am lazy and they are close. all my other art and piercings i&#039;ve had done at sacred on canal street.

				To be honest, anything my husband had done at Fat Cat has been gone over by different artists.&nbsp; To be fair, we went there approximately 10 years ago.&nbsp; We were young and wanted tattoos so we didn&#039;t bother to check credentials.&nbsp; My husband has a tattoo that you can&#039;t even read and it&#039;s a bit disappointing.&nbsp; That one will be gone over as well when he finishes designing a sleeve for that arm.<br /><br />I also had work done there at the same time and I have no regrets, then again, the guy who did my work isn&#039;t there anymore so...&nbsp; &nbsp;I know people who&#039;ve gotten stuff done there that are very pleased with it.&nbsp; To each their own.&nbsp; <br /><br />Go to Yana!&nbsp;

				yeah i know.<br />the dude who did my other stuff is no longer at sacred. it&#039;s nothing original, i brought in what i wanted and he did it. the trick was that it didn&#039;t hurt. as long as they can make exactly what i bring in, without me flying off the seat in agony i&#039;m cool.

				just remember, a tattoo is forever.<br /><br />pick the best artist you can. location, i mean, within reason, should not be an issue. <br /><br />the biggest test i ever had was to make an appointment for my tattoo, as the guy was so good he was booked solid for 2 weeks. it&#039;s amazing what you have to go through in your head when you&#039;re waiting 2 weeks to get a tattoo.<br /><br />you&#039;re in nyc, ffs, go look through some magazines, find the person who does what you want the best. there should be no shortage. <br /><br />then, when you find someone amazing, go. then take a picture, and show us all that fine tat and the place you got it :)

				I think it hurts like hell. I passed out during mine, but I thnk that was more because he stopped to give me a break, and gave my mind a minute to catch up...out I went. Luckily he was cool with it and finished the tat after I came to. <br /><br />THere is still a tatoo place on ditmars...next to Inside Astoria. Anyone know anything about that place?

				I got mine done 5 years ago by a woman named Squid at Fly Rite in Williamsburg.&nbsp; Not sure if she is still there but interviewed about 10 different people around the City and liked her stuff the best.&nbsp; Yes, it was painful but really worth the trek to Brooklyn for it.

				Painful?&nbsp; I&#039;m such a wimp.&nbsp; I want one, but I&#039;m afraid of the pain, plus, I&#039;m afraid I&#039;d like some design one day, and then 5/10 years later hate the design.&nbsp; And then I&#039;m stuck with it.&nbsp; I&#039;d probably have to get it one drunken night in Mexico, like when Richie Valens gets one in La Bamba.&nbsp; And that would probably be one horrible tattoo.&nbsp; I guess I&#039;ll stick with Henna for now.

				yeah, especially since any reputable artist won&#039;t tattoo while your drunk.&nbsp; Alcohol thins out the blood and you&#039;ll end up a bloody mess in their chair.&nbsp; They don&#039;t want that!&nbsp; It&#039;s really not terrible.&nbsp; Some hurt more than others because of the location on your body.&nbsp; Meatier parts hurt less.

				I used to live near Fat Cat Tattoos when it was on 23rd Ave.&nbsp; They had random shop hours (read: rarely open) and whenever they were open they were usually hanging out in front with their skateboards.&nbsp; That being said, I have no idea how good their artists are, but that&#039;s all I ever saw from that place.&nbsp; <br /><br />My recommendation is New York Adorned on 2nd Ave on the Lower East Side.&nbsp; It&#039;s a little pricier than some places&nbsp; but they do great work (and, anyway, who wants to bargain shop for a tattoo?!).&nbsp; I walked in on a Sunday afternoon with no appointment and was getting my tattoo about 30 minutes later.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t have a picture, I just wanted a phrase in some pretty script.&nbsp; I told the guy what I wanted (I wish I could remember his name), he went in the back for a few minutes and came back with a beautiful tattoo.<br /><br />As far as the pain factor goes, I think it partly depends on where on your body you get the tattoo, and partly depends on your pain tolerance.&nbsp; Personally, I love getting tattoos, including the pain (I know, this kinda makes me a freak).<br /><br />Anyway, that&#039;s my two cents&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				Back in the day when tattoos in NYC were illegal, a man named Hawk did it in his kitchen on 28th Avenue &amp; 36th Street (I was young, I was stupid... ). He did the work on all of my friends -- he was really good. I wonder if he&#039;s still working somewhere in the neighborhood (albeit legally and not in a kitchen).<br />
