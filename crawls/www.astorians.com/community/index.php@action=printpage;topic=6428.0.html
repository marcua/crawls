				If you watch Heroes on NBC you know Sylar, the brain eating, nostrils flaring, watch repairing main villain.&nbsp; Or at least he was the main villain until the season finale last nite.&nbsp; Anywho I saw him, walking along Astoria blvd, right by 37th St, when I was heading home 11am Saturday morning.&nbsp; He must live around here, otherwise why would he be hanging out along scenic Astoria Blvd.<br /><br /><strong>THAR BE SPOILERS BELOW</strong><br /><br />Did anyone watch the Heroes finale?&nbsp; I don&#039;t understand the ending.&nbsp; What was the point of Nathan sacrificing himself to fly Peter into the atmosphere when they could have just shot him and he could have regenerated.&nbsp; Kind of a pointless sacrifice.&nbsp; Plus I don&#039;t believe the Petrelli brothers are really dead anywho.&nbsp; And why couldn&#039;t boring phase through walls guy just die?&nbsp; &nbsp;Serious I could care less about that plot line, and one minute he&#039;s collapsed from a gun shot wound, the next he standing up, holding his family.&nbsp; I like the show, even though sometimes its a real cheesy and not all the acting is what I would call quality, but I thought the finale was just too cheesy.

				<strong>SPOILERS - BE WARNED</strong><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I agree... very little about this made sense.&nbsp; 1) just kill him and he&#039;ll regenerate.&nbsp; 2) why didn&#039;t Peter just fly himself away?&nbsp; 3) why didn&#039;t Peter ever get all of Sylar&#039;s powers? 4) Where did Peter land?&nbsp; He can regenerate, so he&#039;s fine.&nbsp; Ted blew up some, too and he was ok anyway.&nbsp; 5) Peter can regenerate 6) RE-GEN-ERATE!!!!!!!<br />

				Peter can regenerate, but if say he was brought up into the upper atmosphere or even space, then he wouldn&#039;t be able to breath and that would be the end of him.&nbsp; I think he will be back though.<br /><br />Side note...new show next year...Heros:Origins.&nbsp;

				<strong>SPOILERS</strong><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />i was thinking about it and i figure if Peter couldn&#039;t control his powers and that&#039;s why he was going to blow up, then that&#039;s the same reason that he couldn&#039;t fly.<br />if they shot him then they couldn&#039;t bring him back (a la removing the glass from his skull which is where he wanted claire to shoot him) b/c he would have blown up at another point in time. peter wanted to be dead dead dead. <br />i was thinking that nathan flew him up, tossed him and then got outta dodge so to speak. <br /><br />also, didn&#039;t hiro witness the explosion from the police station or Isaac&#039;s apt (from the first episode, i can&#039;t remember where he was exactly but he was being questioned about Isaac&#039;s death) during the DAY and Peter blew up at NIGHT? <br />and how long were they planning on leaving Isaac&#039;s body in the loft?<br />and finally-why did no one notice sylar got away? after all that you would think someone would have said, hey there&#039;s a dead guy over there, might want to clean him up. Instead they all go their separate ways and what forget about him?<br /><br />heff-totally agree about how the hell was DL mobile after he could barely stand 5 minutes before. <br />

				Ok I haven&#039;t seen this episode yet but the spoilers are just confusing and odd.<br /><br />I think I might be a little done with Heroes tho -- it&#039;s gotten too complicated and odd.

				Oh of course, the manhole.&nbsp; I remember now, but I think I was kinda still disappointed by the whole pointlessly emo ending.<br /><br />I&#039;ll keep watching Heroes next season, particularly if its got more of Hiro, who is by far the best character.&nbsp; The show&#039;s ok, being a comic book fan I have an affinity towards it, but I can recognize its just that, ok.&nbsp; Its certainly no Lost, and the acting and background to the characters won&#039;t keep anyone involved the way Lost keeps people watching even when you have no idea whose in the casket and whats up with Jacob and it was a flash forward and oh god I love that show Lost.

(or could have done in the case of the dad)<br />who is the dude worse than the boogey man? (remember Molly called Sylar the boogie and then she said there&#039;s someone worse than the boogey man...someone who can see her when she sees him)<br />Where is little orphan Molly gonna go?<br />What&#039;s the deal with Mr. Devaraux&#039;s communicating from the dead?<br /><br />Sigh...as with Battlestar...too many questions...too much time to wait. but i like hearing everyone&#039;s questions and their conspiracy theories.<br />&nbsp;:mrgreen:

				<strong>SPOILERS</strong><br /><br /><br /><br />I can accept that Peter just didn&#039;t have the sense about him to fly up into space when he was about to explode, and that he didn&#039;t know how to use all his powers. I can grudgingly accept that Claire didn&#039;t want to shoot him, since the whole season has had the characters too afraid to do anything drastic to anyone (except coming from Sylar of course- and then people were afraid of killing Sylar), and this was obviously just a plot device to get his brother to show up and save the day. But why didn&#039;t they cut off Sylar&#039;s head just to be sure he was dead? Just running him through with the sword was lame. Why did they hint that the morphing woman has an alternate true appearance, but then when Nikki knocked her out she looked like she usually does? WTF was up with that dream sequence with Peter? I think I had more questions, but I can&#039;t think of them right now.<br /><br />Why are all the characters except for Sylar, Claire, and her dad so freaking stupid? I can suspend belief for a lot of things, and I can deal with some unanswered questions, but the blatant dumbness of the characters whenever it counts makes the show less like a good show and more like a bad horror movie. I think it got worse as the season went on.

				I finally saw this and I think it has again confirmed that I don&#039;t need to see the next season.&nbsp; I like Hiro but the whole thing seems to have sort of lost it&#039;s focus after season 1.&nbsp; <br /><br />Maybe I&#039;ll catch up on season 3 when it comes out on DVD.&nbsp; The generations concept is interesting but... eh, I just wanted something more definitive and redeeming from most of the characters.&nbsp; The ending seemed arbitrary and forced.

				I thought 2?&nbsp; Maybe 2 parts.<br /><br />The first was getting them to the &quot;save the cheerleader moment&quot; -- the second &quot;save the world&quot;.<br /><br />I don&#039;t have a TV so I&#039;ve been watching this thing online in the nbc viewer.&nbsp; Enough to drive anyone a little nuts.&nbsp; Also probably tempers my tolerance/interest in returning next season.

				Well, it&#039;s only been one season.&nbsp; They took a break for about a month or two to, I assume, film more episodes because the show was doing well.&nbsp; <br /><br />You can download episodes of Heroes and other shows at www.tv-links.co.uk or fanpop.com.

				Last season&#039;s finale took the wind out of our sails, frankly. We were really into it (we rented the entire DVD set since we&#039;re hardly ever home on a consistent basis to catch any regular broadcast), but decided to not bother with Season 2 after that disappointing finish.... :|
