				INDONESIAN FOOD BAZAAR May 31, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., behind Masjid al-Hikmah, 48-01 31st Avenue (at 48th Street), Astoria, Queens. (Bazaars are also planned for June, July and August.)<br /><br />Several times each summer, the small parking lot outside the al-Hikmah mosque in Astoria is awash in aromas and flavors that seem straight out of an Indonesian kampung, or village. Most of the vendors are home cooks who otherwise offer their food by special order only; almost everything is $5 or less.<br /><br />Look for gado-gado and lothek, a pair of vegetable salads with crunchy highlights, awash in sauce that’s hand-ground (and spiced to order) for each customer; combro, a deep-fried, chili-spiked croquette of grated cassava; satay plates of skewered beef and chicken, accompanied by peanut sauce and blocks of sticky rice; the long-simmered stew called beef rendang; chicken or beef noodle soup; and cendol, iced coconut milk laden with green rice noodles and tiny cubes of colored jelly, and laced with palm sugar.<br /><br />has anyone been to this before?&nbsp; Sounds interesting...<br /><br />

				Went last month—it was terrific. We were there in the late morning and again in the afternoon and it never got too crowded, though that may change with the recent NYT writeup. The communal picnic tables were bustling but there was room to seat a fair number of people. All of the vendors we encountered were friendly and eager to explain their wares. The gado-gado was wonderful; spicy peanut paste mashed up fresh and lots of veggies. Tried a bunch of other foods but that&#039;s what stood out to me (it was that crazy-hot 90 degree day so I was a little woozy by the end of it!). <br /><br />

				Here&#039;s the mosque&#039;s website:<br />http://www.masjidalhikmahnewyork.org/<br />Though I only see this weekend&#039;s food bazaar mentioned.<br /><br />Dave Cook, who wrote the NYT article I mentioned earlier, likely will be keeping track of upcoming bazaars on his website: http://www.eatingintranslation.com<br />

				In addition to what Brikka mentioned, I found out about this on the Serious Eats website:<br /><br />http://newyork.seriouseats.com/<br /><br />It linked to the NYT article that Brikka mentioned.&nbsp; Dave Cooks site, eating in translation is great too.&nbsp;
