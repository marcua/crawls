				Has anyone checked out the Riverview coop bldg in the old Eagle Electric bldg by Astoria Park?&nbsp; I keep reading nothing but negative comments on forums like this (that it&#39;s ugly, cheaply made, etc), but my husband and I are seriously considering buying there.&nbsp; Compared to other condo/coop bldgs we&#39;ve seen around Astoria this place is looking good.&nbsp; The apts are really big, the prices are reasonable for the amount of square footage you&#39;re getting and the location right by the park is a really attractive perk.&nbsp; It&#39;s true that they used cheap materials and that the use of space in some of the layouts is strange.&nbsp; Also the ext. of the building could have a better design - but all the other buildings we&#39;ve seen have similar issues.&nbsp; We are concerned about buying into new construction when sales seem to be sluggish, tho.&nbsp; &nbsp;Just wondering if anyone else has checked it out and is considering it as an option.... or if they rejected it and why...<br /><br />Tx!

				The one serious problem I can foresee is the property itself. The ground the building is on. It is *not* owned by Pistilli. It is being leased for (<em>someone please fill in the blank here</em>) years and then the coop must purchase the property. Each person will be responsible for their fair share and, of course, Pistilli will want to make a profit on the sale.<br /><br />ASK QUESTIONS, AND GET EVERYTHING IN WRITING. Then have your lawyer look at it before you sign anything!

				Yes, that land lease is an item of concern.&nbsp; The lease goes for 49 years, but there&#39;s an option to buy in the year 2012 and there&#39;s a clause in the prospectus that says the apt corporation is required to exercise that option at that time.&nbsp; However, the Pistilli people have told us that they&#39;re setting aside a fund to make the purchase and it will not have financial implications for the shareholders.&nbsp; Of course, this is not in writing as of now so we&#39;re wary.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also, rumor has it that Pistilli himself has purchased one of the million $$ penthouses in the property - not sure if that&#39;s a good thing or bad thing.<br /><br />I&#39;m new to the boards by the way, so a friendly hi to everyone.&nbsp; &nbsp;We&#39;ve been renting in Astoria for 7 years and are hoping to own soon....<br /><br />

				There is always risk when purchasing new construction.&nbsp; From what I&#39;ve heard, the units are very reasonable.&nbsp; But that&#39;s to be expected since it is now a co op.&nbsp; Condos are generally more expensive but the carrying costs are lower.&nbsp; Co op maintenance is always higher.&nbsp; And from what I hear, Riverview&#39;s maintenance is quite high.&nbsp; I would have some concern that the upcoming condo conversion could be a shocking expense to the owners at that time.&nbsp; If they say there is a fund, etc., that sounds wise.&nbsp; But you can be sure that once a co op board is formed and the building really gets going with day to day expenses, things may change.&nbsp; I think they are priced reasonably for today&#39;s changing market.&nbsp; A year ago they probably could have asked 50k - 75k more per unit and no one would have flinched.&nbsp; I think the stucco exterior is cheap but it&#39;s the building method of choice all over these days.&nbsp; Stone and brick is preferrable for the long term.&nbsp; The location is good except maybe for the units directly facing the park.&nbsp; I saw some windows had already been damaged and graffiti may come next.&nbsp; I basically think it&#39;s a good thing and will be a welcome addition to the neighborhood.&nbsp; Up to now, Shore Towers has been the only large complex in the area.&nbsp; No doubt other construction is planned or taking place now.&nbsp; The change to the neighborhood is already taking place.&nbsp; It depends on one&#39;s perspective on whether that&#39;s good or not.&nbsp; But we will no doubt see nicer shops and eateries in the immediate area.&nbsp; Ditmars from 19th on up is already showing the changes.&nbsp; I think it&#39;s unusual but I don&#39;t agree with the folks that think it&#39;s an eyesore.&nbsp; I tend to like bizarre things.&nbsp; There are others like me out there so I don&#39;t think it will be a hard sell.&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				Well, I am one who believes the neighborhood is not trash until &#39;better&#39; people more into a new building. Most of the people moving in will probibally be from the neighborhood which will open up their old apartments, well check out what Co-op city did to the Bronx.<br /><br />Everyone is not using that exterior ..... as I understand in some places its banned (Channel 7 had a special on some new homes near Cherry Hill recently that have $60 k repairs with this stuff)<br /><br />The effect that a few monsters like this will have on the power grid? he he he<br /><br />The surrounding blocks, I understand, with almost no information from the press (except glowing tribute) and are trying to piece together the impact this will have on their blocks. For example, parking is completey inadequate.<br /><br />Thats OK that they are worried: a few more places like this and Astoria will finally join up with the anti-development mantra that has seized the rest of the city.<br /><br />What a wonderful place this could have been for artists lofts and the arts. Of course that would have needed a tincture of imagination and creativity, something lacking here for a generation or so.<br /><br />Understand the complex was widely panned aesthetically in the outside world (outside of Astoria, that is), but afterall, Astoria is the lastest word for interesting concepts in urban planning, right?

				I was walking by last Saturday with a galpal and we called to see about getting some general information.&nbsp; The woman who answered was really nasty and basically said that there was an open house and you basically were only shown the size you were interested.&nbsp; When I mentioned that I could &quot;be interested&quot; in either a 1, 2 or 3Br (depending on pricing which she wouldn&#39;t divulge) she took on an even more hostile attitude and wasn&#39;t helpful at all.<br /><br />If that&#39;s the type of service you get just from calling to ask a simple question then I can only imagine what happens when your heat breaks in the middle of a snowstorm!

				I spoke with a realtor and she told me 2 bedrooms are starting at around 480K.&nbsp; Took a long time to get pricing from her.&nbsp; The ad started with: 1 bedroom apartments from 280K+.<br /><br />Seems kinda of high and its definitely out of our price range so we are not going to look.<br /><br />Best of luck in your search.<br />

				CJford - Maintenance fees depend on the square footage of the unit and vary accordingly.&nbsp; It&#39;s also important to note that many of the floorplans at Eagle are unique in that a 2 bedroom in the older factory section is quite different in square footage and layout from a 2 bedroom in the newly built section.&nbsp; I wouldn&#39;t let one less than ideal conversation with a receptionist sway you from making an appointment to view the units.&nbsp; I have heard from 2 separate parties that reception was gruff in making the appointment, but the person who actually showed them around was very pleasant and accommodating, and they were shown a variety of unit sizes in different areas of the building.&nbsp; <br /><br />Jonathan - I also wouldn&#39;t let a quick price quote deter you either.&nbsp; Keep in mind that realtor probably does not represent the property so it might be in their best interest to deter you and show you something else.&nbsp; Everything is negotiable and right now it&#39;s more of a buyers market than it was a year ago, so go check it out for yourself.&nbsp; <br /><br />Bottom line, purchasing real estate is not for the faint of heart.&nbsp; If you&#39;re serious about buying, know what you want/need, what you&#39;re willing to compromise on and what your price points are, contact a mortgage broker, get your pre-approvals in order, toughen up for some tense times, a few arguments and most importantly be an informed consumer - like any major purchase, do your homework and go for it.

				LHT, you seem suspiciously savvy on real estate (like more than a few bloggers here).<br /><br />What impact do you think this will have on the surrounding neighborhood?

				Hmmm... do I point out all the inconsistencies here, or keep my mouth shut? (keep mouth shut, keep mouth shut....)<br /><br />but I do particularly like the part where your tax dollars stay in Astoria (&quot;Why should my elected officials (and taxes) be used to bring you into the neighborhood for you to laugh at me?&quot;), while those of all the new residents just go to the city of New York &quot;Oh, revenue sharing by community board? Or is LIC/Astoria succeeding from NYC?&quot;) ... <br /><br />I wonder how you worked that one out?<br /><br />That said, I think what they&#39;ve done to the Eagle Electric building is hideous. They took a gorgeous building and turned into one of the ugliest things I have every seen. i am really sorry that whoever regulates these things allowed the devloper to go through with such an abomination.<br /><br />However, in terms of development, or overdevelopment, the project is probably a lot better for the community than other things going up in the neighborhood- <br />first off- it uses and existing structure, there is no new construction, no one looses a view that had one before (granted, it suddenly got much UGLIER, but if you saw the river around the eagle electric building before, you will still see it)<br />second- I believe the building does have its own garage, which will minimize its effect on parking<br />and third- in terms of infrastructure, a building this size demands that the power and water grids be adjusted to account for it... unlike the six-family houses that go up in place of two-families and try to use the existing grid. That is where the real problems are. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=4110.msg41840.html#msg41840">Quote from: Gleason on November 22, 2006, 10:02:11 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I would urge each and every one of you to print out this and put it away somewhere.

				Actually talked to surrounding residents and they are not very happy ... the spots for cars is less than the number of apartments in an area with no parking and narrow streets.<br /><br />Again, just think if the original building fabric was maintained and it became arts lofts or performance space. Non profits are being starved in this community.<br /><br />What a wasted opportunity!!<br /><br />But thats ok. The only way we can move forward and catch up to the rest of the city on planning is for these projects to be dropped in our lap thus giving us a wake up call.

No matter how many big, fancy tall buildings they build, blue-collar workers wil always outnumber the white-collar workers here. No-one is looking down on white-collar workers. The neighborhood is known for it&#39;s diversity, not only in terms of ethnic and racial mix, but also in terms of the socio-economic mix. Your neighbors love having you here. They are thrilled that you bring with you finer shopping and eating establishments; your tax dollars and your spending trends are an asset to the neighborhood.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=4110.msg41911.html#msg41911">Quote from: mrferrisbueler on November 22, 2006, 11:25:53 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Daily, I step off the N/W in Johnston &amp; Murphy Shoes, Brooks Brothers Shirt and my Flat Front Banana Pants (obviously a successful corporate mule).

You pushed them to the breaking limit. Before upscale affluent people moved into Astoria, apartments were simply turned over. Now they are totally renovated, to establish a higher rent base, and then turned over. Most of the local white-collar residents moved here from Manhattan or the gentrified sections of Brooklyn. When they were living in 5-story walk up buildings and paying, in excess, of $1500–$2000 for a small studio apartment that they had to be sharing to afford the rent, they looked here and found that they could get so much more, both in terms of apartment size and neighborhood benefits, for less money. And they came in droves only to prove to be transient neighbors and leaving behind them raised rents and landlords who were getting wealthier on the heels of their leaving! As far as the rent controlled thing, you are so dead wrong. By this point most of those tenants are paying as much, and in many cases, more than those in stabilized apartments. Rent stabilized tenants get 3%–5% increases every year. Rent controlled tenants pay 7.5%–13% per year. Every year. And, they also get to defray the landlord&#39;s fuel cost by having to pay an additional $18–$75 per month. Some of them are living with the same sink, toilet, and refrigerator and stove they had when they moved in, in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. If they want a newer one, they have to pay the same increase as anyone else. Plus the fact that most of them are old(er) and living on fixed incomes, and we know that this city is not the place for an old(er) person to live because of the cost-of-living here, their lives are generally quite difficult for them. Only the truly impoverished can get any help from any program to help them survive.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=4110.msg41911.html#msg41911">Quote from: mrferrisbueler on November 22, 2006, 11:25:53 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">All in all, Astorians need to stop being such cry babies.&nbsp; Boo hoo, you hurt my feelings about that.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Now that&#39;s a mature way to deal with your neighbors.

I love Astoria people, all of them, even the white-collar workers. I get really annoyed when anyone bad mouths my Community.

Someone is on a waiting list right now for your place.

				It amazes me the amount of vitriol and hate that is directed toward new building projects in Astoria, but whatever.&nbsp; To each his own.&nbsp; As for me, I have lived in Astoria for 7 years now (not far from Astoria Park), moved here because it was a reasonably priced place to live and had all the qualities I liked in a neighborhood, and for a while have wanted to stop renting and start making my money work for me as a homeowner.&nbsp; Can&#39;t afford a house here - even two family houses are so crazy expensive that we couldn&#39;t swing it even if we rented a floor out.&nbsp; So when new buildings started going up, I was thrilled.&nbsp; Even if the designs are not what I would have chosen - nothing is perfect in this life and I can only choose the best of what&#39;s offered to me.&nbsp; If it was perfect, I&#39;m sure it would be much more money than I could afford.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am more interested in the neighborhood where I live and having an apartment that I really like than in the design choices of the building itself.&nbsp; To me, being able to walk outside my door and have the pool and the running track right there and still be near all the great Greek restaurants, etc. sounds like a good deal.&nbsp; Not to mention the views of the park and bridges from the apartments themselves.&nbsp; Also, the local elementary and middle school is one of the best ranked in the city.&nbsp; <br /><br />With that being said, I am going to post some info on the Riverview bldg for those who are interested - everyone who thinks the building is an eyesore can just ignore this...<br /><br />The people they have working over there that answer the phones and show people around are not real estate professionals.&nbsp; I don&#39;t know where they found these people.&nbsp; I&#39;m not surprised some people have been put off by them - but it is worthwhile to see what the deal is over there if you have the patience and persistence to get past the tour guides.&nbsp; They do open house tours every weekend from 12-4 and then you can make an appointment to see additional units during the week.&nbsp; The sales manager there is a really nice guy but he is overworked beyond belief because he&#39;s the only sales guy they have there.&nbsp; <br /><br />Price for units depend on location in the building, SF, and whether there is an &quot;obstruction&quot; in the apartment (like a post in the middle of your living room), in which case you can get a discount.&nbsp; Most apartments are really large - kitchens are small.&nbsp; One bedrooms on the third floor in the old building (which are above the lofts so are pretty high up) run around $360k - and you could easily put up a wall and make another room like an office or whatever within the space (we&#39;re talking more than 1000 sf and a balcony). Lower floors are cheaper.&nbsp; Inner courtyard apts. are cheaper.&nbsp; Lofts are generally cheaper because they don&#39;t have a balcony.&nbsp; <br /><br />Maintenance is high - it&#39;s like $1 per sf or so - no way around that.&nbsp; &nbsp;But I&#39;ve comparison shopped and it&#39;s not outrageously more expensive.&nbsp; &nbsp;And the cost includes your heat, your air conditioning, the doorman, etc.&nbsp; And it&#39;s something like 46% tax deductible.&nbsp; I do worry about the costs going up in the future, but every purchase has it&#39;s own particular risks.<br /><br />Parking... they have over 100 parking spaces - I forget the exact number.&nbsp; It&#39;s slightly less than the number of apartments in the building, but not by much.&nbsp; As I said, I live in the area and have never, ever had a problem with finding parking on the streets around here - I do not have a garage now so have been parking on the street for 7 years.&nbsp; So if there are a few cars that don&#39;t use the garage, I think it will be just fine.<br /><br />Retail space on the ground floor - they say they have a Greek/Italian restaurant going in and they are lobbying for a deli/convenience store and get this, a gourmet pet food store.&nbsp; the need for that is questionable to me.&nbsp; But they seem open to suggestions of what people would like to see there in terms of retail in that section.<br /><br />Hope this helps.&nbsp; If anyone has specific questions about it, feel free to ask.&nbsp; I have been there so many times in trying to make the decision of whether to buy there that I may have the answer.<br /><br />

				Yet another flak for development :lol:<br /><br />My friend the hatred is not against development. The antidevelopment folks provide patiently reasoned arguments against the negative impact on our quality of life and pocketbook that these rather singular looking objects have on our community. They ask why the waterfront is ok for the rich, but not those that live here. Why are taxes are not spent on improving services (does anyone think we have enough?) but is spent to help campaign donors make more money?<br /><br />Points that pointedly are never addressed except by ....<br /><br />... hatred and vitriol from the prodevelopment crowd. I guess unused to a dialogue, they rant.<br /><br />Its interesting how the pro-development crowd tries to cynically drive a wedge into the community (poor? affordable housing! home owner? you&#39;re sitting on a strip mine! yuppie? lets add to the housing stock!)<br /><br />The funny thing about this, and you might as well address this cause this point ain&#39;t going anywhere, is why the rest of the city is downzoning and Astoria isn&#39;t? Who will pay for the tremendous costs that all this development will have?<br /><br />Isn&#39;t it funny how those behind prodevelopment crowd takes their limos out to the suburbs or spend time (and profits) at their summer homes, while the rest of us ride on increasingly crowded subways?<br /><br />And krocker, how about some speaking engagements on your prodevelopmen rant? Have lots of civics around the city that would love to hear your krocker ... <br /><br />Tell them what you tell Astorians. I dare ya!! :evil:

Isn&#39;t it a matter of shares not the space accoutrement&#39;s that count in value? Also, I gotta tell you that I spent years hating my kitchen floor. It was cheap laminate crap that no matter how hard you scrubbed it, it never looked clean. The appliances were also such crap. An oven that I had to recalibrate every six months to get a cake to rise or a chicken to roast. Faucets on a kitchen sink that sprung leaks 3 times a year. Counter tops that absorbed everything that accidentally spilled on them. And I am in a rental. I got landlord&#39;s written permission to do over my own kitchen. And quite frankly, I spared no expense on the project. I plan on dropping dead in this place, so for me it was an investment in my comfort. If I had it to do all over again, I would like to move into a space that afforded me the luxury of easy clean-up in both the kitchen and the bathroom. Another room with I recently redid. One-handed faucets; glass shower doors; 3-way mirrored medicine cabinet; under sink shelf cabinets; over bowl shelf cabinets. <br /><br />What I am saying is this: don&#39;t just buy something because it is affordable. Buy something you love, that has what you want already built in. Save your money a little longer to afford it—but just don&#39;t settle. While you are making plans for your future, life sometimes gets in your way. You may find yourself living in a space that you really hate for an awfully long time just because you were able to afford it.
