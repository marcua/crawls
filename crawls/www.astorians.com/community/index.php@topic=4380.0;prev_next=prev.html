								<div class="inner" id="msg_44927">&nbsp;:lol:<br /><br />Dear Editor:<br /><br />In the December 6 article &quot;Vallone Meets with Israeli Official&quot; reporter John Toscano tells how local New York City Councilmember Peter Vallone recently met with the mayor of the regional Council of Gush Etzion, a region of the occupied West Bank which includes six mainly ultraorthodox settlements as well as towns. I understand that this region also includes illegal outposts such as Ibei Hanachal, Ma&#39;ale Rehav&#39;am, Pnei Kedem, Sde Bar, Tko’a B+C, Tko’a D&nbsp; and Tzur Shalem. (see: <a href="http://www.peacenow.org" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.peacenow.org</a>)<br /><br />The continuing development of such illegal settlements and outposts is contrary to official US policy. They continue because officials like Vallone wink and turn a blind eye. The many check-points and walls that have been built isolate and impoverish the local Palestinians, many of whom are forcibly unemployed, and restricts urban development along with normal freedom of movement. It is this sort of situation that former President Jimmy Carter has referred to as &quot;Apartheid.&quot; Growing up in the South, Mr. Carter knows how to recognize injustice and oppression.<br /><br />As Astoria residents and presumably constituents of Peter Vallone, we hope that he is taking the trouble to meet with Palestinian representatives to get a more balanced picture. We fully understand the need for security. However, building a just and viable peace plan demands more than a &quot;unilateral&quot; approach. This is not only an immediate security issue. <br /><br />A New York official needs to represent all his constituents instead of building walls among us. He needs to be educating himself independently of special interests. And certainly, Councilman Vallone should not be calling for his constituents to be donating to the settlements-- as he has done-- when this is against Federal policy and insulting to the growing community of Palestinian and Arab residents of Astoria. <br /><br />Adem Carrroll<br /><br />for New Alliance for Middle East Solutions (NAMES)<br /><br />44-10 25 Avenue<br /><br />Astoria NY 11103<br /><br />c 646 251 0402<br /><br /><a href="http://www.qgazette.com/news/2006/1206/features/009.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.qgazette.com/news/2006/1206/features/009.html</a><br /><br />Vallone Meets With Israeli Official At City Hall <br />BY JOHN TOSCANO <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;Countries have a right to defend themselves from those that desire nothing more than to kill their citizens...&quot;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />Taking a dip into international relations, City Councilmember Peter Vallone Jr. last week met with Israeli official Shaul Goldstein at City Hall to discuss issues such as preventing attacks and creating stability in the part of the world where Goldstein serves as mayor of an Israeli city. <br /><br />Vallone (D-Astoria), had met Goldstein while touring Israel two summers ago and had then encouraged him to visit New York City. The Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater New York and its Chief Executive, Michael Miller, organized the trips that brought Vallone and Goldstein together to exchange their ideas. <br /><br />Goldstein is mayor of the Regional Council of Gush Etzion, a collection of municipalities and settlements on the southern border of the West Bank. <br /><br />Vallone, who serves as chairman of the Public Safety Committee, said of the situation in Israel and his meeting with Goldstein, &quot;Countries have a right to defend themselves from those that desire nothing more than to kill their citizens. If that means building a fence to stop the flow of terrorists into a region, then I&#39;ll help them pound the fence posts in.&quot; <br /><br />The lawmaker added, &quot;My friend Mr. Goldstein understands the threat he faces...I&#39;m glad to know him and learn from each other about ways to protect our countries.&quot; <br /><br />Vallone explained that the first attempt by Jews to settle Gush Etzion took place about 79 years ago, in 1972. Since then, the region has been at the center of Arab and Israeli tensions. <br /><br />Palestinian protesters forced settlers to flee on several occasions, during the first half of the 20th century. From 1949 to 1967, Jordan occupied the area. Israel regained control of the Etzion region following the Six-Day War, Vallone continude, and established new settlements that have continued to thrive over the past three decades. Today, the Israeli population in the area approaches 20,000 residents. <br /><br />Vallone said Goldstein&#39;s region governs several communities in still highly volatile areas. In recent years, he said, the Israeli Security Department has built and paved 60 kilometers of security roads, erected still more security fencing, added and renovated bright lighting around communities and installed electric gates at the entrance to each community, according to a Web site. <br /><br />The Security Department, Vallone said, provides each community with a security jeep furnished with essential lighting, communications and first-aid systems. The fences and other security measures have greatly reduced the number of suicide bombings in this area and throughout Israel, by some estimates as much as 90 percent, according to the Jewish Anti Defamation League. <br /><br />Goldstein told Vallone that although the Regional Council works with the national Israeli government, the cost of their extraordinary emergency and security measures has fallen mostly on local authorities and citizens. The province has been able to maintain high security standards by soliciting private donations from benefactors around the world. For more information, visit <a href="http://www.gush-etzion.org.il" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.gush-etzion.org.il</a>. <br /><br />Vallone said, &quot;I encourage anyone to help these people defend themselves against the terrible threat of terrorism that plagues their daily lives.&quot; <br /><br />also fyi<br /><br />The saga of a West Bank hilltop&nbsp; <br />Friday, November 28, 2003 <br /><br /><br /><br />(Published in Haaretz November 2003)<br /><br />Daoud Nassar and Shaul Goldstein both speak eloquently about the need for co-existence and understanding between Israelis and Arabs. But both are also adamant about their rival claims to a tranquil hill bordering the Neve Daniel settlement in the Gush Etzion region of the West Bank, just south of Jerusalem.<br /><br />Nassar, 32, is one of nine children who share a claim to a 100-acre plot of land that has been the subject of legal proceedings for over a decade. While Israel recognizes the family’s property rights to some of this land, about half of the parcel was declared “state land” in 1991. The family submitted an appeal to the “Objections Committee” of the military court that adjudicates such disputes in the territories captured by Israel in 1967. This appeal was succinctly rejected in 2002, despite the witnesses brought by the family to testify that the Nassars have cultivated the land for decades. On July 9, the High Court of Justice reviewed the case and sent it back to the military court, ordering it to explain its decision. The military court delivered the requested documentation in late September and the Nassar family’s attorneys submitted a response last month. The next step will be to set a new date for a High Court hearing, probably in early 2004. <br /><br />Goldstein, 44, is the head of the Gush Etzion regional council. He views the Nassars’ claim as another last-ditch attempt by Arabs to stymie the Jewish settlement effort. In his view, the land in question has definitively been declared state land and can be developed at the council’s discretion. As the court saga continued this summer, Goldstein inaugurated a new neighborhood overlooking the contested land in his Neve Daniel settlement, which is home to over 200 families.<br /><br />Nassar says that his grandfather, a Christian from Lebanon, purchased the land in 1916, and he presents copies of land registration documents from the 1920s that bear the official stamp of the Israeli civil administration. His father and uncles grew up on the land, sleeping in a cave and cultivating figs, olives and grapes. When his grandmother’s health began to fail in the 1950s, the family moved to Bethlehem, but his father would come every day to farm the land. One unmarried uncle stayed continuously on the land until he died in 1987 at the age of 93. Nassar fondly recalls growing up with this land as part of his natural environment and says that he would not think of selling it. <br /><br />Until recently, there has not been any friction between the Nassars and their Jewish neighbors. (Besides Neve Daniel to the east, Kfar Etzion – a community that pre-dates the state of Israel – is located to the south, and the Betar Illit settlement is several kilometers to the west.) Earlier this year, however, settlers began plowing a road up a hillside that the Nassars claim as part of their property.<br /><br />Lawyer vs. bulldozer<br /><br />Nassar’s attorney, Jonathan Kuttab, describes the confrontation over the road during a conversation in his East Jerusalem office, overlooking the gardens of the American Colony Hotel: “I remember it was on Election Day [January 28]. We went there – George [Daoud’s brother], a surveyor, myself and another lawyer, and two clergymen. The road they were digging was clearly on the non-disputed part of the Nassar’s property. We tried talking to the guy operating the bulldozer and to someone who was there with a gun, but they didn’t want to listen. We then called the police, but they wouldn’t come. So I decided to do a bit of non-violent protest. I used to do this a lot during the first intifada.”<br /><br />At this point, Kuttab gets up from his chair to act out the drama: “I stood in front of the bulldozer and didn’t move. He dug to my right and then to my left, I lost my footing, but remained on the ground in front of the bulldozer. Finally, he gave up trying to get past me, telling me, ‘You’re lucky I still have a conscience.’ Then they called the police and this time the police came.”<br /><br />Goldstein is fully convinced that the road did not infringe on the Nassar property, but was being carved up the hillside in the area that had been declared state land. He points on a map to an easier route they could have chosen for the road, but says they decided to take a more circuitous route precisely in order to avoid having to cut through Nassar’s land. In the interests of avoiding a confrontation, the settlers decided of their own accord to stop the road project “until the matter is clarified,” he adds.<br /><br />Nassar confirms that no further work has been done on the road project, but charges that the settlers vented their anger by uprooting some 250 trees from his property. <br /><br />Goldstein says he has no knowledge of any such incident and emphasizes that he has zero toleration for acts of harassment against Arab farmers. “If I see someone touching a fig, I tell them to stop and to come take a fig from my garden instead.” <br /><br />In principle, Goldstein says, he has no problem with individual Arab farmers who have legitimate claims to land. “What’s ours is ours, and what’s theirs is theirs. There’s only a problem when it comes to nation against nation,” he says. “We’re no less stubborn than them,” Goldstein adds, noting that his father fought in this area in the 1948 War of Independence and that he is continuing this fight. He explains that the area where Neve Daniel was established in 1982 was part of the Cohen Farm purchased by a Jewish family in the early 1900s and sold to the Jewish National Fund in 1935.<br /><br />Goldstein, a mechanical engineer and Israeli Air Force veteran, has served as head of the regional council for about four years. He also grows nectarines and cherries on Neve Daniel and emphasizes that his plot of land is “entirely on Jewish land.” Prior to his position at the regional council, he operated a contracting business for about 10 years and says he got to know many Arabs in the area through this work. <br /><br />According to Goldstein, the actions of some peace activists and reporters have served to inflame tensions and undermine the efforts to build co-existence with his Arab neighbors. He was annoyed, for example, that some peace activists came to plant olive trees with the Nassars on territory he regards as state land that is under the jurisdiction of the Gush Etzion regional council.<br /><br />Tent of Nations<br /><br />Daoud Nassar, who studied business and tourism management, and works organizing youth exchange programs, has formed a Tent of Nations organization, supported by groups in Switzerland and Germany, where he did some of his studies. His vision is to bring groups of people from different nations for dialogue sessions under the trees on his family’s hilltop.<br /><br />In particular, Nassar speaks passionately about the need for Israelis and Palestinians to learn more about each other. He recalls seeing how Israeli and Palestinian youth who met in dialogue encounters in Germany were shocked to learn basic information about each other – that Israelis eat falafel and humus, for example, or that Palestinians have computers and e-mail accounts.<br /><br />But Nassar is a bit guarded when asked whether he would be interested in conducting a dialogue with his neighbors from Neve Daniel. “If they want to meet us as people, to see the place we’re living and to hear our story, why not?” he says. “Everyone is welcome here, this is our ideal, our philosophy. It’s not just for a show. We need people who really want to understand each other.”<br /><br />Goldstein also has no objection to meeting with Nassar, as long as the meeting is not staged as a media event. “No problem,” he says and tells the story of how a neighboring Arab farmer came to his office to complain about damage done to his field. After confirming that the report was correct, the council made sure that the damage was immediately repaired, Goldstein says.<br /><br />Kuttab, who earned his law degree at the University of Virginia and practiced on Wall Street for several years before opening his law office in Jerusalem in 1980, is not particularly hopeful about the outcome of Nassar’s court battle. “Who knows?” he shrugs and launches into a bitter description of the “legal sophistry and trickery” Israel uses to take over land in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. <br /><br />For example, Kuttab explains, Israel can declare as state land any agricultural land in the West Bank and Gaza that has not been under continual cultivation for 10 years. And, indeed, Goldstein dismisses Nassar’s claim to the contested land by citing aerial photographs showing that the land was not being cultivated. <br /><br />But even if the Nassar family’s land is state or public land – which it isn’t, Kuttab insists – “Why is public land only allocated to Jews?” he asks. The answer, he explains, is that Israel is defined as a Jewish state and that this translates into equating the public interest with Jewish interests. <br /><br />Goldstein makes no apologies about this: “Indeed, the state of Israel is the state of the Jews and, therefore, its lands are earmarked first and foremost for its Jewish citizens. Any effort to change this is in league with Arafat’s design for a state of all its citizens.” <br /><br />Basically, there is nothing unique about Nassar’s case, Kuttab concludes. The High Court will have to decide whether Israel’s public relations interests take priority over its appetite for land. In most cases, the court prefers not to overrule the decision of the military courts, he notes. <br /><br />But the Nassar family is a bit unusual, Kuttab adds, in that “they have this crazy idea that maybe they can get justice.” Or, as Daoud Nassar says, “Living in this country, you are not allowed to give up hope.” <br /><br /><br /><br />// posted by Ira @ Friday, November 28, 2003 <br />Comments <br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_45443">Dear Councilmember Vallone:<br /><br />Breed-specific legislation punishes certain breeds or classifications of dogs and their owners while overlooking bad behavior in other breeds. While it is true that a few individuals of these so-called &quot;dangerous&quot; dog breeds have done an astonishing amount of damage when they bite, statistically very few have ever bitten a person. Punishing the &quot;pit bulls&quot; and their owners because of their potential for greater damage than a Bichon is like banning all buses in favor of passenger cars. There are advantages and disadvantages to either mode of transportation but we can not expect a car to serve the same purpose as the bus.<br /><br />I find it horrifying when a person is maimed or killed by a dog, especially when the person is a child. However I rationalize my reaction to the incident, I must remain rational enough to place the responsibility for the tragedy directly on the people involved, not on the animal itself. The circumstances that make a dog bite a person vary with the situation, training, and/or environment which the dog encounters or lives in. This stark fact remains: all breeds and varieties of dogs can, will, and do bite.<br /><br />The problem lies with the people breeding, owning, or training dogs for purposes for which were not intended. Pit Bulls and their kin were designed and bred to fight each other, not people. Due to the tenacity and physicality of the breed, people have decided to make them one of the primary representations of a bad dog. People use the dog to compensate for their own insecurity and to promote a macho image. These people and their dogs should be avoided. Backyard breeders have caught on to the popularity of these kinds of dogs and are now turning out litter after litter of ill-tempered mongrels just to make a quick buck. The wise buyer avoids these dogs at all costs.<br /><br />Ignorant, dangerous owners and breeders are attempting to turn the pit bull breeds into vicious guard dogs. The breed standard, however, considers human-aggression in these breeds to be a serious fault. The pit bull that aggresses against a person is not a true representative of the breed. It is entirely the owner&#39;s fault if their mongrel has the chance to bite or attack someone. Responsible owners and breeders work hard to uphold the standard of loyalty and affection that should be present in the well-breed dog.<br /><br />Any pit bull that threatens, attacks, bites, or even shows aggression toward a person, other than in defense of its own people, should be neutered at the very least or, preferably, should be destroyed. The danger in owning or being in contact with such animal cannot be over emphasized. If, however, a Bichon, just like your GusGus and my Frankie, exhibits the same behavior it should receive the same treatment. Aggression toward humans is not a behavior that should be tolerated in any dog. Dachshunds, Shitzus, Pomeranians and Chihuahuas, however small, are still capable of inflicting serious wounds, and even killing a baby or child.<br /><br />Similarly, owners who permit their dog to aggress, bite, or attack any person should pay for it. Breed-specific legislation does nothing to deal with the entire problem of dog attacks. It only focuses on a dog&#39;s appearance, without regard to individual temperament or owner responsibility.<br /><br />I understand your concern and desire to protect your constituents from the awful tragedy a dangerous dog can cause. You, I am sure, intend to do so with the law you are proposing. However, all you will do with such a law is turn thousands of pet loving voters against you personally and you will be viewed as a terrible person who will cruelly deprive animal lovers of their well behaved pets.<br /><br />I am sure this is not your intention. To avoid making such a terrible mistake in your proposed legislation I suggest you contact the American Kennel Club in New York and ask for their draft version of a dangerous dog law. This law has been enacted in several states and provides the general populace ample protection from dangerous dogs while still permitting the people who properly train and socialize their pets to retain them.</div>
