				This may get some negative nods, but I found it humorous......<br /><br /><br />Read Ad, then response.<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Real ad from Craig&#039;s List<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />What am I doing wrong? <br /><br />Okay, I&#039;m tired of beating around the bush. I&#039;m a beautiful(spectacularly beautiful) 25 year old girl. I&#039;m articulate and classy.I&#039;m not from New York. I&#039;m looking to get married to a guy who makes at least half a million a year. I know how that sounds, but keep in mind&nbsp; &nbsp;that a million a year is middle class in New York City, so I don&#039;t think&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m overreaching at all.<br /><br />Are there any guys who make 500K or more on this board? Any wives? Could&nbsp; you send me some tips? I dated a business man who makes average around&nbsp; 200-250. But that&#039;s where I seem to hit a roadblock. 250,000 won&#039;t get&nbsp; &nbsp;me to central park west. I know a woman in my yoga class who was married&nbsp; &nbsp;to an investment banker and lives in Tribeca, and she&#039;s not as pretty as&nbsp; I am, nor is she a great genius. So what is she doing right? How do I&nbsp; &nbsp;get to her level?<br /><br />Here are my questions specifically: <br />- Where do you single rich men hang out? Give me specifics- bars,restaurants, gyms <br />-What are you looking for in a mate? Be honest guys, you won&#039;t hurt my&nbsp; feelings <br />-Is there an age range I should be targeting (I&#039;m 25)? <br />- Why are some of the women living lavish lifestyles on the upper east&nbsp; &nbsp;side so plain? I&#039;ve seen really &#039;plain jane&#039; boring types who have&nbsp; &nbsp;nothing to offer married to incredibly wealthy guys. I&#039;ve seen drop dead&nbsp; &nbsp;gorgeous girls in singles bars in the east village. What&#039;s the story&nbsp; &nbsp;there?<br /><br />- Jobs I should look out for? Everyone knows - lawyer, investment&nbsp; &nbsp;banker, doctor. How much do those guys really make? And where do they&nbsp; &nbsp;hang out? Where do the hedge fund guys hang out?<br /><br />- How you decide marriage vs. just a girlfriend? I am looking for&nbsp; MARRIAGE ONLY <br /><br />Please hold your insults - I&#039;m putting myself out there in an honest&nbsp; &nbsp;way. Most beautiful women are superficial; at least I&#039;m being up front&nbsp; &nbsp;about it. I wouldn&#039;t be searching for these kind of guys if I wasn&#039;t&nbsp; &nbsp;able to match them - in looks, culture, sophistication, and keeping a&nbsp; &nbsp;nice home and hearth. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />PostingID: 432279810 <br />THE ANSWER <br />Dear Pers-431649184: <br />I read your posting with great&nbsp; interest and have thought meaningfully&nbsp; &nbsp;about your dilemma. I offer the following analysis of your predicament.<br /><br />Firstly, I&#039;m not wasting your time, I qualify as a guy who fits your&nbsp; bill; that is I make more than $500K per year. That said here&#039;s how I&nbsp; &nbsp;see it. <br /><br />Your offer, from the perspective of a guy like me, is plain and simple a crappy business deal. Here&#039;s why. Cutting through all the B.S., what you<br /><br />suggest is a simple trade: you bring your looks to the party and I bring&nbsp; my money. Fine, simple. But here&#039;s the rub, your looks will fade and my<br /><br />money will likely continue into perpetuity...in fact, it is very likely&nbsp; &nbsp;that my income increases but it is an absolute certainty that you won&#039;t<br /><br />be getting any more beautiful! <br /><br />So, in economic terms you are a depreciating asset and I am an earning&nbsp; asset. Not only are you a depreciating asset, your depreciation&nbsp; accelerates! Let me explain, you&#039;re 25 now and will likely stay pretty&nbsp; hot for the next 5 years, but less so each year. Then the fade begins in&nbsp; &nbsp;earnest. By 35 stick a fork in you! <br /><br />So in Wall Street terms, we would call you a trading position, not a buy&nbsp; &nbsp;and hold...hence the rub...marriage. It doesn&#039;t make good business sense&nbsp; to &quot;buy you&quot; (which is what you&#039;re asking) so I&#039;d rather lease. In case&nbsp; you think I&#039;m being cruel, I would say the following. If my money were&nbsp; to go away, so would you, so when your beauty fades I need an out. It&#039;s&nbsp; as simple as that. So a deal&nbsp; that makes sense is dating, not marriage. <br /><br />Separately, I was taught early in my career about efficient markets. So,I wonder why a girl as &quot;articulate, classy and spectacularly beautiful&quot;<br /><br />as you has been unable to find your sugar daddy. I find it hard to&nbsp; &nbsp;believe that if you are as gorgeous as you say you are that the $500K&nbsp; &nbsp;hasn&#039;t found you, if not only for a tryout. <br /><br />By the way, you could always find a way to make your own money and then&nbsp; &nbsp;we wouldn&#039;t need to have this difficult conversation. <br /><br />With all that said, I must say you&#039;re going about it the right way.&nbsp; &nbsp;Classic &quot;pump and dump.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; I hope this is helpful, and if you want to enter into some sort of&nbsp; &nbsp;lease, let me know.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				Oh my goodness, she is desperate, esp. with the line “where do rich men hang out?&quot;&nbsp; Good grief.<br /><br />“What am I doing wrong?”&nbsp; <br />“I am looking for marriage only” <br />You’re money hungry, which probably means you’re shallow.&nbsp; <br /><br />Her posting should be flawless, if she&#039;s that articulate and classy.&nbsp; :-D<br /><br />

				About two weeks ago one of my workers failed to properly enter in a credit card sale, and the customer left without the transaction being recorded.&nbsp; I called the credit card company to try to contact the customer to see if they would authorize the transaction and her bank told me they&#039;d contact her, but it was completely in her hands.&nbsp; Two weeks go by and I heard nothing.<br /><br />Then out of the blue she actually comes into my shop.&nbsp; She didn&#039;t want to phone with credit card information so she actually made the trip in from Jersey just to settle up.&nbsp; She even tried to refuse a little package of treats I wanted to give to her as a thank you.<br /><br />Good, regular, honest folk like that can just make your whole day better.&nbsp;

				The fact that this guy&nbsp; :mrgreen: is named &quot;mrgreen&quot;. When I was a kid I had a PlayMobile set. My dad and I used to play with it. One of the little figurines we named Mr. Green (because he was green). He was a hypochondriac who had a penchant for jet-fuel enemas. So whenever i see that bit of code I think of those fun times with my dad&nbsp; :-)

				98 pages of reviews now. <br /><br />Enough of the reviews are literary in nature that I think this is some kind of planned prank. Like the nekkid guys at Gap - I think. There&#039;s another one for bic pens that&#039;s similar in nature, but I don&#039;t have the link. It was on amazon uk.<br /><br />This is my favorite review of the moment:<br />&quot;WANTED: Somebody to buy milk on the internets with me. This is not a joke. You&#039;ll get paid after we drink it. Must bring your own weapons and be able to crawl through a series of tubes. Safety not guaranteed. I have only done this once before. &quot;

				WTF?! Yeah, thank God I scroll fast!!!&nbsp; :-o<br /><br />Back to topic: my grandfather being an endearing, elderly (97) Italian gentleman, I have a soft spot for the old Italian guys I see in the neighborhood.<br /><br />This morning, there was this one guy, shuffling slowly, accompanied by a younger woman, I presume his daughter. I found it quite touching.<br /><br />Then another older man approaches them from the opposite direction gives a friendly smile and says, <em>&quot;Romeo i Giulietta! Buon giorno!</em>&quot; And I hear more <em>&quot;Buon giorno&quot;</em>s and <em>&quot;Buon Natale&quot;</em>. Old friends meeting up on the street. It was great.<br /><br />&nbsp;:-)

Dr Pepper supports Axl, and fully understands that sometimes you have to make it through the jungle before you get it right.<br /><br />&quot;It took a little patience to perfect Dr Pepper&#039;s special mix of 23 ingredients, which our fans have come to know and love,&quot; said Jaxie Alt, director of marketing for Dr Pepper. &quot;So we completely understand and empathize with Axl&#039;s quest for perfection -- for something more than the average album. We know once it&#039;s released, people will refer to it as &quot;Dr Pepper for the ears&quot; because it will be such a refreshing blend of rich, bold sounds -- an instant classic.&quot;<br /><br />Show your support for Axl and get on the nightrain of encouragement at <br />&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size">www.chinesedemocracywhen.blogspot.com</span>&nbsp; -<br /><br />About Dr Pepper<br /><br />Dr Pepper is a leading brand<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; :rock:&nbsp; :rock:&nbsp; :rock:<br /><br />Press Release from Axl Regarding Dr Pepper<br />We are surprised and very happy to have the support of Dr Pepper with our album &quot;Chinese Democracy,&quot; as for us, this came totally out of the blue. If there is any involvement with this promotion by our record company or others, we are unaware of such at this time. And as some of Buckethead&#039;s performances are on our album, I&#039;ll share my Dr Pepper with him.<br /><br />Axl Rose<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

				&nbsp;Cops bust high school root beer kegger (http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080328/ap_on_fe_st/odd_root_beer_kegger;_ylt=AtBNk0vrksAVXWMlo8RGJAYDW7oF)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">WAUSAU, Wis. - Cars lining the street. A house full of young people. A keg and drinking games inside. Police thought they had an underage boozing party on their hands.<br /><br />But though they made dozens of teens take breath tests, none tested positive for alcohol. That&#039;s because the keg contained root beer.<br /><br />The party was held by a high school student who wanted to show that teens don&#039;t always drink alcohol at their parties. It has gained fame on YouTube.com.<br /><br /><strong>Dustin Zebro, 18, said he staged the party after friends at D.C. Everest High School got suspended from sports because of pictures showing them drinking from red cups.<br /><br />The root-beer kegger was &quot;to kind of make fun of the school,&quot; he said. &quot;They assumed there was beer in the cups. We just wanted to have some root beer in red cups and just make it look like a party, but there actually wasn&#039;t any alcohol.&quot;</strong><br /><br />Zebro purchased a quarter-barrel of 1919 Classic American Draft Root Beer, and by 10 p.m. Saturday, the scene outside his rural Wausau home had all the makings of a teen drinking party — cars, noise and kids.<br /><br />Kronenwetter Police Chief Daniel Joling said an officer was dispatched to the home March 1 on a complaint of cars blocking the road.<br /><br />Juveniles began coming out of the house after the officer used his squad car&#039;s loudspeaker to warn that cars would soon be towed, Officer Jason Rasmussen wrote in his report.<br /><br />Nearly 90 breath tests were done, and officers even searched locked rooms for hiding teens.<br /><br />&quot;It was a tremendous waste of time and manpower, but we still had a job to do, and our officers did it,&quot; Joling said. &quot;If one kid had come there, even hadn&#039;t drank there, but had come there and had been drinking and had left and crashed and burned, then what would the sentiment be? Why didn&#039;t the police check everybody out?&quot;<br /><br />D.C. Everest schools Superintendent Kris Gilmore did not immediately return a message Friday.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This kind of makes me smile.&nbsp; Sweet revenge on the untrusting grownups.&nbsp; I like a good crafty teenager every now and then.&nbsp;

				What Makes 100%? What does it mean to give MORE than 100%? Ever wonder about <br />those people who say they are giving more than 100%? We have all been to those <br />meetings where someone wants you to give over 100%. How about achieving <br />103%? What makes up 100% in life? <br /><br />Here&#039;s a little mathematical formula that might help you answer these <br />questions: <br /><br />If: <br />A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z <br /><br />is represented as: <br />1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26. <br /><br />Then: <br /><strong>H-A-R-D-W-O-R-K </strong><br />8+1+18+4+23+15+18+11 = 98% <br /><br /><br />and <br /><strong>K-N-O-W-L-E-D-G-E </strong><br />11+14+15+23+12+5+4+7+5 = 96% <br /><br />But , <br /><strong>A-T-T-I-T-U-D-E </strong><br />1+20+20+9+20+21+4+5 = 100% <br /><br />and, <br /><strong>B-U-L-L-S-H-I-T </strong><br />2+21+12+12+19+8+9+20 = 103% <br /><br />and, look how far ass kissing will take you. <br /><strong>A-S-S-K-I-S-S-I-N-G </strong><br />1+19+19+11+9+19+19+9+14+7 = 118% <br /><br />So, one can conclude with mathematical certainty, that While Hard Work and <br />Knowledge will get you close, and Attitude will get you there, its the <br />Bullshit and Ass Kissing that will put you over the top.<br /><br />

				A while ago, someone we don&#039;t know at all posted a request on a City University of New York web bulletin board, seeking proofreaders. By mistake, she put my gf&#039;s phone number on the ad. Angie received several calls answering the ad. Today she got a call from a Russian fellow.<br /><br />He is a computer programmer type and a philosopher. He wasn&#039;t offering to proofread. Rather, he has written a book and he&#039;s searching for a proofreader for that, or perhaps an editor. He talked to Angie a while. She didn&#039;t think she could help him out, but she suggested that I like to read, so maybe I would.<br /><br />I called the guy back. He explained that all his friends are Russian, and he&#039;s looking for someone to check the English grammar and idiom. Now I have two installments of <span class="bbc_u">The Anatomy of Happiness and the Universal Meaning of Life</span> in my email in-box. I hope he is the next Alain de Botton (http://www.alaindebotton.com/cv.asp).<br />

				Bstewart, your random smiles make me smile -&nbsp; 8-)<br /><br />And this is not truly random and could go under another thread, but it did make me smile greatly for a few reasons.<br /><br />http://newyork.seriouseats.com/2009/01/tortilleria-nixtamal-corona-queens-nyc-fresh-masa-tamales-mexican-italian.html<br /><br />I will ask Megc if she would write more about this Tortilleria - Nixtamal - somewhere in Queens not very far from Flushing Meadows and Citifield.<br />Now I want to figure out when to get back over there.<br />On their small menu is a curious item called an Italian tamale. Interesting, very, but I want to try more of the Mexican items.<br /><br /><br />http://www.flickr.com/photos/eatingintranslation/3334146921/<br /><br />http://www.eatingintranslation.com/2009/01/whats-it-all-ab.html<br />(http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3392/3334146921_b935a1920c.jpg?v=0)<br /><br />ps We also happened across a very wonderful man in the neighborhood who had an amazing garden in front of his house. Love exchanges and experiences like that.<br /><br />

				GM and Chrysler may be taking their last gasps on their death beds, but way over in Baghdad, Iraq (of all places) the Hummer is real hot as a status symbol, screaming red and howling yellow being the colors of choice. The car which is generally scorned by the Iraqi population is a model made in -you guessed it- Iran!<br /><br />&quot; &#039;No one complains that they remind them of the American military,&#039; Mr. Hilli said. &#039;It’s much more trouble driving around in a Samand.&#039; Made in Iran, the car is the surrogate object of many Iraqis’ scorn for Iran itself.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Iraqis love their cars. &#039;In Iraq, people judge you by your car, and you’re not a man without one,&#039; he said. When it comes to Hummers, he added, they will nearly always be bigger than anyone else’s vehicle. That is where &#039;hasad thukuri&#039; comes in; roughly translated, it means &#039;penis envy.&#039; &quot;<br /><br />http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/30/world/middleeast/30hummer.html?adxnnl=1&amp;hpw=&amp;adxnnlx=1238428853-nZ8a3No3N1dywp2hD0pW0Q<br />

				Awww, I hate those airbrakes too!!&nbsp; :cry:&nbsp; :-P<br /><br />My new niece and nephew approached me at our wedding last week, all excited to present me with a personal gift: A custom-made potholder!&nbsp; :-o It was a big secret, apparently- they wouldn&#039;t tell anybody else what their surprise gift was. And I absolutely love it.&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				<br />It is not here, and it probably belongs under foods but this report makes me smile<br /><br /><br />http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/05/an-endangered-butcher-gets-his-groove-back/#more-247561<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">...<br />“I walked in cold to one and then another and another, found the chef and said: ‘I am Jeffrey. I’m your local butcher. I want your business. What can I do for you?’ ” The result: 65 new orders.<br /><br />Mr. Ruhalter, who has offered butchering classes for a few years, added a sausage-making class that was an immediate hit, at $75 a pop.<br /><br />“Sausages have become a major player,” he said. “I can custom-make them fat free and salt free. I make them from lamb, pork, veal, chicken, turkey, venison, wild boar, elk, all natural, organic,” he rattled off. “They’re selling out.”<br /><br />It also helped that the Essex Street Market recently extended its hours to 7 p.m. instead of 6 p.m. and is now open on Sundays, bringing in extra money.<br /><br />Between the therapy and the new revenue streams, Mr. Ruhalter has gotten much of his groove back, and he has decided to remain in business.<br /><br />Though Day of the Rose remains on hiatus, female customers still get special attention from Mr. Ruhalter, who wears his long brown hair in a ponytail and has two hoop earrings on his left ear. “Swashbuckling,” is how he describes his look.<br /><br />A longtime practice he has maintained, despite everything, is paper-wrapping a handful of thick-cut bacon for each new customer. If he knows it is your birthday, it might be a free steak.<br /><br />...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
