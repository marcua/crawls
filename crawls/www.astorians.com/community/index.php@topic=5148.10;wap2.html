			Can I ask a question about these flourescent light bulbs?&nbsp; Do they blink and flash like the ones in office buildings do?&nbsp; I&#39;m an artist and most of the time we shut these lights off, and either work in the dark or with a regular lamp, because of the kind of light they emit.&nbsp; The constant blinking which you can&#39;t normally detect but your eye does, in addition to the constant blinking of the computer, messes with your eye - which is a big reason you don&#39;t blink as much when you&#39;re on the computer and why you end up with dry red eyes.&nbsp; The lights also isn&#39;t great for judging artwork color by.&nbsp; And it&#39;s so harsh too.&nbsp; And your skin looks so bad in that kind of light.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-P<br /><br />Have they started making flourescent bulbs that are more like sunlight?&nbsp; That would be much better.

			Over time I have gotten a lot more involved and interested in green living so this is a really great topic IMHO.<br /><br />We got a compost bin nearly a year ago and have been composting ever since. It is really great because we&#39;re able to turn around and use it in our garden, which means healthier and more diverse soil and less waste overall.<br /><br />Yes - you read that right - we have a garden. I&#39;ll call it an urban garden. We do container gardening since we don&#39;t have any sort of dirt other than store-bought and homemade. We try to grow our own tomatoes to save money (and food miles) over the summer. Tomatoes are almost always the most expensive thing that we buy, and additionally it is very likely that they are not grown near NYC, so this is a great one. We also try to grow other things like herbs. We love doing it, so it is rewarding in so many different ways.<br /><br />I try to buy most of my clothes at the thrift store. As a general rule I hate paying full price for something when in a regular store, so this is even better. I have gotten a lot of good quality clothes, too, (my best jeans come from the thrift store) and I usually leave the store having only spent $20 or $30 for clothes that would have originally amounted to more than $100 - $200. Additionally, I turn around and donate clothes to the thrift store. I think it is a great way to save on material waste. There are some things that I have a hard time buying at thrift stores - underwear and shoes. I will pay full price for a good pair of shoes, and I&#39;m happy to buy underwear on sale as long as it didn&#39;t have a previous owner.<br /><br />I do generally try to get a lot of organic food products, but don&#39;t always. One thing I struggle with in my own mind is the &quot;organic but not sustainable&quot; thing. There are some really great organic products that are from California, for instance, yet the amount of pollution it took for those products to get to NYC kind of cancels out the organic benefit. It is rather ironic that a product that wasn&#39;t made with pesticides harms the environment anyway just because of the vast amount of distance it travels. This is one reason why I love CSAs - you&#39;re supporting food that was grown near you. Great benefit to the farm(er), great benefit to you (organic/local), and great benefit to the environment (CO2 emissions are much lower).<br /><br />Great thread! :mrgreen: It&#39;s giving me extra ideas!

			We do a couple of things that are probably as good for the environment as for saving money:<br /><br />Instead of using paper towels, we bought a whole bunch of white cloth dishtowels and use those for clean-up instead.&nbsp; Every other week or so, we wash a load of them with bleach.<br /><br />I have a reusable cloth sack for carrying my lunch from home.&nbsp; I wrap my sandwich in foil and recycle after several uses.&nbsp; In general, we try to recycle and re-use as much as we can.&nbsp; I refill my water bottle and recycle only after it gets too gross to continue to use.&nbsp; Old clothes get used for workout gear, rags, etc. if too ratty to be donated to the Salvation Army.&nbsp; Old toothbrushes and sponges are saved for cleaning.<br /><br />We buy large size containers of cooking oil, dishwashing liquid and laundry detergent and refill smaller, easier to handle containers.&nbsp; All cleaning solvents are biodegradable and organic.<br /><br />I&#39;d love to get into the habit of turning off power strips when leaving the apartment, but it seems like too much of a hassle.&nbsp; I have a friend who does that, though, and she saved big-time on her electricity bill.<br /><br />daisy, we use energy-saving lightbulbs that work just fine and don&#39;t flicker - I don&#39;t know what brand they are, but they come in a coiled shape.<br /><br />What I&#39;d love to know is what to do with vegetable waste (we eat veg at home) if we don&#39;t compost or garden.&nbsp; Any ideas?

			Wow, there are so many great ideas here. <br /><br />The &quot;no shopping&quot; compact I am participating in this year is helping me really be more thoughtful about what I buy. (I have one shopping day a month where I can shop in places other than thrift stores). I&#39;m amazed at how little I miss shopping - it may be harder when spring arrives. I do occasionally catch myself oggling some awesome boots on my way to work, but I have not succumbed. <br /><br />Something else I am interested in is sharing resources. Instead of everyone buying a lawnmower, maybe sharing a lawnmower with your neighbors. Of course, none of us have lawnmowers, but it&#39;s a thought.
