				Hi - my brother and his family arrive this weekend for a visit.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have any children, so I am not sure where I can take them or what kids of things there are to do with kids in Astoria, or NYC in general.&nbsp; Their ages are 3 and 6.&nbsp; Any suggestions you can offer are much appreciated - thanks!

				Well, depending on how far you wish to go, you could always take them to the Bronx Zoo. Kids always love the zoo, and if that&#039;s too far, there is always the Central Park Zoo. http://nyzoosandaquarium.com/cpz (http://nyzoosandaquarium.com/cpz)

				The zoo suggestions are good.<br />They might be quite young. Some zoos have great petting zoos/learning sections.<br />When is the butterfly exhibit?<br /><br /><br />I also like the Queens Hall of Science. And if children can appreciate another &#039;world&#039;, the Met museum.<br />Both have interesting playgrounds, the <span class="bbc_u">Ancient playground</span>, and the <span class="bbc_u">hall of science </span> has an unusual playground.<br /><br />Manhattan also has a <span class="bbc_u">children&#039;s museum </span> with fun activities, and an outdoor area.<br /><br />There is also the AMNH for natural history. If they were older, check out the planetarium.<br /><br />Enjoy.<br />I could not imagine growing up in NYC. But othertimes it seems like a wonderful place for even the youngest.

				You said if they were older they would enjoy the planetarium. The first time my father took me to the late belated Hayden Planetarium I was 5. Enjoyed every minute of it, but got pissed off when he wouldn&#039;t buy me a Good Humor chocolate eclair bar afterwards ( he has always hated giving sweets to kids-even his own kids). But now that it is the Rose Center for Earth and Space, it is a whole different ball game, plus it&#039;s a hell of a lot more expensive. Actually it seems that the AMNH has a ton of kid and family related stuff: http://www.amnh.org/kids/?src=toolbar (http://www.amnh.org/kids/?src=toolbar)&nbsp; I mean, horses, lizards and snakes, OH MY!!

				I too think the Museum of Natural History/Planetarium would be an awesome choice, and I don&#039;t think they are too young for it, especially the six year old.&nbsp; In addition to being a great museum for everyone, they are extremely well set-up to entertain and educate kids -- they have a Discovery Room (http://www.amnh.org/education/students/program.php?id=22) for kids and families that is like a big, hands-on playroom.<br /><br />Time Out New York kids&#039; section (http://www.timeout.com/newyork/kids) has a listing of events taking place this week (http://www.timeout.com/newyork/kids/search/events/page=1&amp;date=THIS_WEEK).&nbsp; In the beginning it&#039;s theater-heavy, but there are many pages of other things.<br /><br />If the weather&#039;s good - on Saturday, Kids Fest 2008 (http://www.timeout.com/newyork/kids/events/around-town/56624/kids-fest-2008) is taking place in Madison Square Park:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Time Out New York Kids teams up with the Madison Square Park Conservancy for this annual outdoor fair chock-full of art activities, face painting, live animals, tasty treats (courtesy of Whole Foods) and more. All ages.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Sunday - how about a puppet show (http://www.timeout.com/newyork/kids/events/theater/65603/the-world-on-a-string)?<br /><br />Closer to home - Socrates would be a nice option.&nbsp; The Hall of Science or the zoo would also be great.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t feel like trekking to the Bronx, the Central Park zoo, while small, has enough to keep them entertained for awhile.&nbsp; And the Queens Zoo (http://nyzoosandaquarium.com/czabout#qz) is only a stone&#039;s throw from the Hall of Science.
