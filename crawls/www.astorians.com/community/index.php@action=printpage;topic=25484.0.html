				Im hearing alot of people complaining about no heat in their apts tonight. I know temps dipped tonight but some of those people want to be in shorts and tanktops in their apts ,meanwhile they are complaining. This makes no sense to me . If you are cold from now bundle up

				?? I can&#039;t tell if this is serious or not. No heat means no heat, i.e. pretty damn cold. You try getting up in the morning to take a shower in an apartment with no heat in this weather. That&#039;s why there are laws about this.

				Essen I guess you didnt understand what I wrote /&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Some people that ive heard complaining , are complaining while in tank tops and shorts .&nbsp; Does that make sense ?&nbsp; &nbsp;If you are cold , you should wear the proper clothing even if indoors . Sweats , socks , fuzzy slippers whatever .&nbsp; &nbsp;And the law states , the heat after 10pm has to be at 55 degrees .&nbsp; That goes till 6am .&nbsp; &nbsp;Yea 55 degrees is cold and my heat would never even turn on since my place even with the heat off , never drops that low . Thats why its written like that , cuz everyone is expected to dress warmer when it gets cold . You cant just lay around like its summer and expect the landlord to pump the heat and money out the window

				<strong>ODENHAL</strong> must agree with Thanos , <strong>ODENHAL</strong> has 2 building that he must take care of 1 is a commercial building ,but the other is a mixed use with apartment tenants that would call up complaing about the heat . <strong>ODENHAL</strong> would knock on the door and these tenants would answer in shorts and t-shirts and&nbsp; still have air conditoners in the windows. It&#039;s like &quot;come on&quot; <br />&nbsp;

Obviously it&#039;s unreasonable to want it be hot enough inside to wear shorts and tank tops in cold weather. I was referring to the people who aren&#039;t part of that tank top/shorts &quot;some,&quot; who might have reasonable complaints that it is actually quite cold in their apartments because the heat hasn&#039;t come on at all yet. <br /><br />I&#039;ve lived in more than one apartment where it seems to have to get very cold outside before the heat actually starts working, and the days/weeks of in-between weather like this gets pretty unbearable in places like that. I&#039;ve also lived in places where the heat blasts so hot and continuously in the winter that I have to keep the windows open with fans blowing freezing air in. That is also not desirable.

				Well like I said unless it drops to under 40 degrees&nbsp; at night landlords rnt required to provide heat .caulking&nbsp; windows , sealing cracks, plugging up gaps under doors makes a huge difference . I know people will still complain so space heaters r sometimes needed. Many places now have individual boilers where tenants control and pay for the heat they use. All the apts I rent are like that .

				i have tenants that call up at 9:00 (or later) at night and say that there was no heat ALL DAY.<br /><br />The time to call is when you&#039;re cold, not when you&#039;ve BEEN cold ALL DAY.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&quot;We thought the heat would come on at night, when it got colder&quot;<br /><br />I can fix the heat, but I can&#039;t fix stupid.<br />
