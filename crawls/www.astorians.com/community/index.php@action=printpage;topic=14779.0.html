				I know that many things have been said but I just don&#039;t understand why the prices are so high in Astoria. Don&#039;t get me wrong, I love the area but the prices seem artificial to me. I know the area is popular but it seems that prices have fallen more in Manhattan. Someone please enlighten me as to how this makes sense. I live in the Ditmars area and affording a home or even a condo for that matter is beyond approach. If one looks at the median household income for the area it doesn&#039;t jibe with people being able to buy. I&#039;m certainly under no illusions that everyone falls into 50K range but six hundred and seven hundred thousand dollar single family homes! Have the majority of home owners been here forever? One of the many things I like about this area is that it is very working class. Maybe I am delusional but, how do we afford anything?<br /><br />If I have offended anyone this is not my intention. I&#039;m just stating what seems obvious to my naive eyes.

				There are people who live in homes which were purchased for $50,000 or less in Astoria.&nbsp; I am not sure who is buying the homes that are $700k and over.&nbsp; I did meet some folks who have purchased expensive homes and they are Attorneys, CPA&#039;s and such.

				I do think housing prices will continue to ease, and Astoria will not be &#039;immune&#039; to the housing downturn. Granted I don&#039;t think the downturn will be as bad as in places like Florida or anything like that, but the worst is not over imho.

				It is unfortunate for anyone looking to buy.&nbsp; I am starting to consider purchasing my first home.&nbsp; I can work in pretty much any city, but my girlfriend works in theater, so that pretty much limits me to NYC.&nbsp; I recently looked around at the prices for single-family homes around here because we love Astoria, and was astounded.&nbsp; 700K is utterly ridiculous!

				I can&#039;t imagine when these homes were purchased for 50k. From what I have heard, single family homes in the mid 1980&#039;s were well over 200 thousand. I feel like I&#039;m missing a piece of this puzzle! Why haven&#039;t Astoria prices&nbsp; dropped as much as Manhattan prices? My uneducated guess is that they will, but it still amazes me. Even if the economy wasn&#039;t drowning, the price of admission would still be crazy. I just really wonder how bad things have to get before these bloated prices reflect their actual worth.

				They were around 200k in the late 80&#039;s early 90&#039;s (roughly), it was this last RE craze that drove them up to ridiculous levels. Thing about price dropping is that there needs to be excess supply and not enough demand. As soon as a home lists in the ditmars area, tons of people flock to them and they usually sell pretty well (at this point not as well as say 2yrs ago, but still doing ok).<br /><br />I think the fact that it&#039;s a residential area, close to manhattan and has conserved itself pretty well, is what keeps the price from dropping significantly (because they have dropped a little). And I&#039;m talking about houses, those condo prices are just nuts

				You&#039;re under no illusions when you say many home owners (1-2 family) have been here a long, LONG time. However, one can&#039;t compare co-ops/condo prices w/ those of 1 or 2 family homes because of the crappy new construction of the developers of apartments for sale.<br /><br />For the most part, old time neighborhood 1-2 family home owners don&#039;t have at risk mortgages. Many don&#039;t even have mortgages. That means there are not many&nbsp; &quot;motivated sellers&quot; who are suffering from unemployment or scam mortgages.<br /><br />When you mention 600-700k for 1-2 family houses, I have to make a point. While some have sold in the last 4 years at ridiculous prices, there haven&#039;t been many transactions in that league for some time. In fact not many transactions have happened at all for houses in the 4 or 5 zip codes of Astoria in a year. Check the comps. Also - many of these retired folks&nbsp; put houses on the market for no other reason except to brag (lie) at the cafes to friends that they could get a king&#039;s ransom for 2000 sqf. If one goes on an appointment for a house for sale, ask the selller(s) where are they relocating. An answer of I don&#039;t know yet means..... the house ain&#039;t for sale and the owner is looking for attention with nothing better to do.<br />

				It is dropping, although slowly. There are some people who are still under huge illusions about getting millions for their homes. We saw a home a few weeks ago that was listed at 650K but had been condemned. We didn&#039;t know that until we got there. LOL. Suprise! They were basically selling the lot at that price. Still on the market today.<br /><br />There is another lot near our house that was a beautiful 1 family home. About a year ago, they vacated it and sold it for 1.3 mil. It was slated to become another ugly condo building until a few months ago when all the signs were taken down and a for sale sign went up on the construction fence. There are still a lot of buildings under construction-once they are completed and can&#039;t be sold for what the owners were expecting, things will change a bit more.<br /><br />There are also nice, renovated 1 family homes in upper ditmars area in the 450-600 range. These were untouchable a year and half ago.

				Unfortunately people are under the impression their homes are worth $700k and up because that&#039;s what NYC claims their property is worth and that&#039;s what the city bases their property taxes on. Real Estate agents know that most home values were inflated, even before the economic downturn.

				I expect prices to return to mid 90s level. I have seen houses on the market for over a year and still not sold. What it comes down to is that families cannot afford houses on a median income. Prices have to come down or they simply won&#039;t sell. <br />An observation I have from this are is that of the houses I have seen sold, not a single one went to a family. Every one was torn down for a 6 or 8 apt. or condo. That tells me that regular families are priced out of the market. Now with the building stopping due to money problems or overbuilding, there is no one &nbsp;left to buy. Unless prices become affordable. It&#039;s called return to the mean in economics. Bubbles burst, always have, always will. The only variable is the time it takes.

				When I bought my 3-family 11 years ago at $350,000 everyone in the neib whispered what a ridiculous price it was (and the same building next door sold at the same).<br /><br />Now, it&#039;s worth about 1 million--which I think is ridiculous.

But what you think it&#039;s worth, probably based on sales that are now out of date, and what someone will actually pay are two different things. There is now an almost unprecedented amount of supply in Queens. (16-18 months).<br />A rule of thumb is that a home like yours is worth 10x annual rent. (The reason is, if someone were to buy it as a pure commercial property, anything more than that and they would lose money.)<br />So whatever your total rent is is an indicator of it&#039;s worth.

So he pays $1mil for your house, tears it down and builds a multi-apt dwelling. I don&#039;t see how the numbers add up if he sinks $1.5mil to $2mil into it and tries to recoup. There is a serious glut of condos and the rents he would get would not finance his debt.<br />Unless he is laundering money, then it works.

				Legal 3 family homes in Astoria are usually over 1 mil , so webmamma saying hers is valued at 1 mil isnt far fetched . You can look at what sold in Astoria recently and even though many homes may have not sold at this crazy time , due to difficult mortgages and downpayements , the ones that did sell are still up there in price. No one is getting a 3 family for 500k unless its ready to collapse . Upper ditmars brand new 3 families less than a year ago sold for 1 mil , so even though times are tough , they havent dropped much if any&nbsp; and rents r still very high .&nbsp; Astoria hasnt seen a huge hit yet simply because the area is in heavy demand . If you want to pick an area like ridgewood or ozone park , im sure prices have fallen by alot . Same goes with longisland , if u pick areas like great neck or manhasset you arent gonna &quot;steal &quot; something . Go to west hempstead or valley stream and you will find a bargain , simply cuz no one wants to move there . My parents bought their 2 family on ditmars and 28st in 1973 for 45k . in the 80&#039;s it was worth abt 200k+&nbsp; &nbsp;in the 90&#039;s&nbsp; 400k+ and in 00&#039;s before this mess abt 850k .

				Wow I&#039;m glad you wrote in! Not that I was considering selling anyway, but I was thinking...really? 500k??<br />I mean big apartments, brick, on tree-lined 28th street...still, it helps mentally to know if I had to have a fire sale...<br /><br />But ofcourse it all comes down to demand. To me, the house is priceless because there is no where I&#039;d rather live. I love Astoria, and I love that I&#039;ve known my neighbors over 10 years and we&#039;ve watched each other&#039;s kids grow up, and my oldest is in class with kids that he played &quot;cars&quot; with in the playground when he was only 1 year old. No one has sold one of these houses since I bought mine 10 years ago.

				We&#039;ll see. I say these are bubble prices that will return to the mean.<br />Prices do go down (the 90s a prime example). <br />Again houses are usually fairly priced at 10x annual rent.&nbsp; A quick, back of the envelope calculation tells me that the rent on a three apt building would be about $5000/mo.<br />That&#039;s $60,000/yr and a value of $600,000.<br />I don&#039;t think the banks are going to go beyond the 4x income standards for a long time.<br />Also what houses sold for a year ago is far fro9m relevant given what&#039;s happened to the economy since then.

				Housing prices are (almost) always a lagging indicator. Just like jobs, but they&#039;re the last thing to rebound in a down economy. If the jobs come back, then house prices follow.<br /><br />Sure, Astoria might be a little bit of an &quot;in-demand&quot; area, but there is no way that prices continue to be so high. Either people don&#039;t sell and the surrounding areas go lower in price, and that results in a price drop here, or people do sell at lower prices, pushing prices down. With the possibility of deflation, wage-cuts, higher unemployment, and lower rental costs, housing prices have nothing to do but fall in this area. I&#039;ve always heard Astoria likened to Manhattan as far as the market goes, and Manhattan&#039;s prices have fallen nearly 25%. Factor in the glut of new building here...and I think it&#039;s all on the downslope.<br /><br />Now, the depreciation of (artificially, perhaps never existent) prices is a good thing. It allows more equality for those who don&#039;t have homes to be able to purchase, not just the ones who have been here forever or the super rich.

In retrospect, we would have waited to buy, but we had no way of knowing what was going to happen with the market. We agonized over the decision to buy, but it was the right thing for us to do at the time. We love our house and we&#039;re here for the long haul. No regrets.<br /><br />I&#039;m curious to hear about other people who bought in the last few years, as well as those who hope to buy in the neighborhood one day.

This is just not going to happen. Most people bought their house in this neighborhood decades ago, they are not desperate to sell, and the people who bought houses in Astoria recently are doctors, lawyers, CPAs etc, they are not struggling either.<br /><br />According to this website http://queens.blockshopper.com/ Astoria is one of the most Expensive neighborhoods in queens and had only 1-2 foreclosures from 2006 to today.<br />

				For those who are interested, median prices in the Astoria zip codes 11102, 11103, 11105 and 11106 <br /><br />Past year: -20%<br />From peak: -30%<br /><br />I gather this includes different types of properties, single family, multi-family, condos/coops etc.<br /><br />Ditmars area is the one bright spot in the Astoria real estate landscape. Prices went up in the last year and it has had the smallest decline from peak of all the zip codes.<br /><br /><br /><strong>11102</strong><br />Median price 519K -- down by 18% (from 635K) year on year from April 08 to April 09.<br /><br />The market peaked in early 2008 with a median asking price of 823K making current prices almost <strong>37% lower </strong> than peak.<br /><br /><br /><strong>11103</strong><br />Median price 540K -- down by 25% (from 762K) year on year from April 08 to April 09.<br /><br />The market peaked in mid-2008 with a median asking price of 832K making current prices about <strong>35% lower </strong> than peak. <br /><br /><br /><strong>11105</strong><br />Median price 715K -- up 3.5% (from 690K) year on year from April 08 to April 09.<br /><br />The market peaked in late 2007 with a median asking price of 797K making current prices around <strong>10% lower </strong> than peak.<br /><br /><br /><strong>11106</strong><br />Median price 430K -- down by 40% (from 700K) year on year from April 08 to April 09.<br /><br />Statistics for 11106 are odd. There must have been a big sale in 2001 that skewed the numbers because that looks to be the peak year with a median asking price of 2.1M making current prices over 80% lower than peak. I used <strong>40% lower</strong> from peak as the average.<br /><br /><br /><br />The number of sales have plunged in all zip codes.<br /><br /><br /><br />edit: numbers from www.trulia.com<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

In retrospect, we would have waited to buy, but we had no way of knowing what was going to happen with the market. We agonized over the decision to buy, but it was the right thing for us to do at the time. We love our house and we&#039;re here for the long haul.

				You deny there was a bubble against all evidence and you talk about what people are &quot;willing&quot; to pay. Well it&#039;s about what people can afford to pay. Right now there is at least 18 months of inventory in Queens. That&#039;s about 6 times what a healthy market has. And prices are at close to 7x median income. A market like that does not stay stable. <br />&quot;It&#039;s different here&quot;. I heard the same thing from people in California, Florida, South Carolina. It&#039;s never &quot;different&quot; here.

				Unfortunately I&#039;ve look high and low for a house in Astoria (and nearby neibs) but anything in the 5 boroughs is going to be expensive and I don&#039;t want a condo and I don&#039;t want a co-op, I want a house with a yard .. the whole nine yards.<br /><br />I found a house but it&#039;s over an hour away from the city (far from Astoria where I grew up) but I had to put sentiment aside and take advantage of the buyers market we&#039;re in and was able to buy a really nice home in Ulster County.<br /><br />Good thing is that my son is staying in Astoria (in my apartment) so I&#039;ll still be coming in regularly.&nbsp; It&#039;s a two bedroom apartment and even though he&#039;s looking for a roommate I&#039;m sure he&#039;ll welcome Mom coming over to clean up and do the Mom things.<br /><br />Hopefully the prices will continue to decrease a bit more so that regular folks can afford to buy in Astoria.&nbsp;

				We had been looking for an affordable 3 family or even a two family for a couple of years.&nbsp; Just nothing we could afford to buy AND live in.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just purchased a co-op here in Astoria for what seems to be a very good price.&nbsp; Would have liked a home with a yard but getting a affordable home, that will never need me to be the handy man, seemed like a good compromise.&nbsp; We plan on staying put for some time and doing some upgrades to the place.&nbsp; In my opinion the value can only go up over the next 10yrs or so.&nbsp; Either way, we get to stay in Astoria!&nbsp; You lucky people.

				Congrats to all that have just bought , condo house whatever . Home is home .&nbsp; As for those who are waiting like ed for prices to fall because this place &quot; is not different&quot;&nbsp; .... well it is different . You see being a hop skip and not even a jump to manhattan&nbsp; makes Astoria alot different , than say florida or nevada , which are top crime states . Need proof ? well show me all those houses that have sold for so much less&nbsp; in this crazy time where people have lost their jobs and just have to sell for so much less or risk losing it to the bank ?&nbsp; I wanna see a house on ditmars sell for half of what it was worth 2 yrs ago , like they have in vegas and arizona . you keep stating houses are only worth a certain amount of rents they can bring in a month .&nbsp; Well that isnt written in stone and every area has different rankings and ratings . You cant base that example to be correct since apts in Astoria go for much more than what someone would pay in corona or in jackson heights . People pay 1100-1200 for a studio on broadway where in bayside you can get a&nbsp; big 2 bedroom for that price . Reason being is location , not to mention safety ,good people who care abt their neighborhood,&nbsp; good schools and a good nightlife .&nbsp; So thats why Astoria is &quot; different &quot;

				If you mean rent prices are the same in bayside as in Astoria , you are totally wrong . I know so many people who own and rent out apts in bayside as well as cousins and other family members who own&nbsp; and have apts , and they dont get as much as places in Astoria rent out for . My cousin rents out a&nbsp; huge 3 bedroom duplex , meaning 2 floors&nbsp; and she gets $1800 plus she pays their heat . Upper ditmars apts , 2 bedrooms are at 2 grand and up ,plus&nbsp; u pay heat .&nbsp; My electrician rents out 1 bedroom apts&nbsp; in bayside , max he collects is $1100.&nbsp; Astoria has studios for $1100, if you are lucky that is .&nbsp; Not saying you wont find people paying a high rent in bayside , but most people work in the city so they want to live closer to the city . You know how the commute to bayside is? I do . It sucks . Whitestone is even worse , no trains . No one would pay more to live farther unless&nbsp; they work out on the island or in that area , which you will find much less of a demand in , so therefore rents cant jump like they did here .

				I am mainly talking about house prices. But even though your anecdotes are interesting, a quick side by side comparison of rentals on Craigslist shows me that the rents are pretty comparable between Bayside and Astoria.

				From today&#039;s WSJ:<br />http://blogs.wsj.com/developments/2009/06/16/deutsche-bank-predicts-40-drop-in-new-york-home-prices/<br /><br />By Nick Timiraos<br /><br />How much further could home prices tumble in the New York City metro area? Deutsche Bank predicts a decline of 40.6% from the first quarter of 2009.<br /><br />That’s a slight improvement over the 47.4% decline that the bank’s analysts had forecast in March, and it reflects in part the fact that prices have dropped since then. Still, prices would have to drop another 32% from the first quarter of 2009 to return the New York market to levels of affordability not seen since 1998.<br /><br />Affordability measures whether a household at the median family income could purchase a home given median prices and at prevailing interest rates. (Deutsche Bank assumes a 5% mortgage rate, which means that prices could have to fall further if interest rates don’t return to the 5% level that they reached earlier this year.)<br /><br />Already, affordability in some 74 of the top 100 U.S. housing markets have already returned to their historic highs.<br /><br />Median prices in the first quarter of 2009 dropped to $446,000 in New York, down 19% from the peak of $552,000 set in the second quarter of 2007. Deutsche Bank forecasts a total peak-to-trough decline of 52.1%.<br /><br />Some of the top California housing markets are now undervalued based strictly on affordability. But rising job loss and price-cutting foreclosure sales could lead to another 11% price decline in Los Angeles and a 14% decline for Riverside, Calif. San Diego appears closest to the bottom, with just another 8.7% decline before reaching bottom.<br /><br />

				Yes, those undesirable locations, like Manhattan.<br /><br />&quot;Financial firms have cut more than 183,000 jobs in the Americas in the global credit crisis, driving down prices and rents in the New York area. In New York City, Manhattan co-op prices slid the most since 1995 in the first quarter, according to data from Miller Samuel Inc. and broker Prudential Douglas Elliman Real Estate. &quot;<br />Bloomberg<br /><br />&quot;In this year’s first quarter, sales of co-ops and condominiums in Manhattan plunged nearly 60 percent from the first quarter of 2008.

				From Tulia:<br />The median sales price for homes in <span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Astoria, Queens</strong></span> for Mar 09 to May 09 was $575,000 based on 35 sales. Compared to the same period one year ago, the median sales price decreased 16.7%, or $115,000, and the number of sales decreased 31.4%. Average price per square foot for Astoria was $362, a decrease of 20.8% compared to the same period last year.<br /><br />The Deutche Bank numbers are a forecast. What they expect to happen in the next few years. Their current numbers of a decline of 19% are accurarte. And Astoria at 16.7% does not seem immune.<br />The drop in sales numbers indicates a very weak market.
