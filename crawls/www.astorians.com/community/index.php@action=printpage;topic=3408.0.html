				Has anyone else been following this kerfuffle?<br /><br />http://www.slate.com/id/2149675/ (http://www.slate.com/id/2149675/)<br /><br />Other than the fact that the one woman is sort of leaning back, I don&#39;t think this photo necessarily says &quot;relaxed&quot;.&nbsp; What&#39;s necessarily relaxed about a group of people sitting in front of a terrible thing in the process of happening and talking to each other?&nbsp; Is it simply the fact that the people in the photo appear young, so the assumption is that their response must be callow, and callous, and inappropriate?&nbsp; I&#39;m kind of leaning toward that explanation myself.<br />Anyone?

				i&#39;ve seen the photo before. i always assumed what it was...people talking about what is taking place behind them. and the irony of them sitting in what looks like such a peaceful spot with the oppostite behind them.

				I guess it also depends what time the photo was taken and what info those people had at the time.&nbsp; Maybe, they are under the impression it was a fire, but not the extreme situation it actually was.

				Let&#39;s not forget that this was 2001 and if the fire department couldn&#39;t communicate properly with each other or the police or 911, how could these people possibly already know what was happening?<br /><br />even when you are just two blocks away from a bombing site (which I have been), you don&#39;t know the exact number that died or injured or who got hospitalized (unless you are family) until hours later...<br />

				Via Gawker, found a link to a story in Slate in which two of the people in this picture respond:<br /><br />http://www.slate.com/id/2149578/ (http://www.slate.com/id/2149578/)<br /><br />He and his girlfriend sound like they&#39;re squared away and rightfully pissed off over being used this way by a total stranger with an agenda.
