				I&#039;ve long wanted to do this here in the neighborhood but have not had the time. that is, starting another antiwar group whose main focus will be to get as many other people as possible involved (organized and active), rather than what I&#039;ve seen thus far with existing groups which are really great at organizing many events, but are not great at organizing (bringing other Astorians into the fold) per se. so the emphasis would be, above all, to reach out to and organize as many people as possible. in past activist work i have found it is crucial to take the message of &quot;yes we can be involved, yes we have the right to let our voices be heard, and yes there are many of us (in Astoria) who feel this war is wrong and immoral&quot; beyond simple words and abstract language. teaching myself political and moral self-empowerment has been most profound when I&#039;ve actually put it to practice. and most importantly always by reaching out to as many other human beings as possible. my hunch is that there is a real need for and a vacuum of <strong><em><em>organized</em></em></strong> antiwar people power in the neighborhood. what there are 200,000 Astorians? can it be true that only a handful are interested in saying in a united voice &quot;enough is enough!&quot; &quot;we are not powerless to voice our convictions or reach out to others?&quot; <br /><br />i realize that there may be many thoughts/comments about this subject especially from people who have already been organizing in the neighborhood and i welcome them especially, since i think that starting a conversation about this subject is of great importance. i also want to say that each of us offers what we can when we can and however we can. And that much repect is due for all the amazing antiwar work that AFPJ the Greens and other groups have done in our neigborhood thus far.<br /><br />i look fwd to to a discussion here and if there are people who are already down to get to work i am beyond ready myself and can start by meeting on weekends. thanks for reading this and hope that an end to this war makes this dicussion moot really really soon!
