			People keep alluding to their collections of bad/funny date stories and I thought I&#039;d create a space for those stories to be told. <br /><br />One of my bad date stories: <br />I went out with a guy who seemed really jittery. I figured he was just a little timid about going on a date. We had lunch, went for a walk and had a talk about politics that I found rather annoying, and then nicely said goodbye. <br /><br />He called me a few days later to chat, and asked me if I had ever done drugs. I answered in the negative and then asked him. He started talking about all the drugs he had used, and not in a &quot;but that&#039;s over now&quot; sense but with a sense of pride. And then I realized why he was jittery! When he suggested we go out again, I found a gracious way to say &quot;thanks but no thanks.&quot; <br /><br />

			I would love to tell some of mine, but unfortunately, my profile&#039;s a little too public, and I&#039;d rather not rile up some disgruntled ex-date by writing up about him.&nbsp; But ask me in person sometime.&nbsp; I have a drug story very similar to yours!

			Hi folks!&nbsp; Of course it&#039;s a dating thread that gets me posting again - natch.&nbsp; My story isn&#039;t so much a bad date as a bad being dumped moment. Two or so days after Crapentine&#039;s Day (on which I received a very sweet card hinting at my former jerk&#039;s more-serious-than-he-let-on feelings for me) I get a phone call. &quot;We can&#039;t hang out on Friday. I&#039;m seeing someone else. I&#039;ve been in love with her for three years. She feels the same way and I only just found out; I have to see it through. I&#039;m sorry.&quot; So that sucked, particularly since I had just started getting Fridays and Saturdays off work (because my wacky schedule was a point of contention, you see).&nbsp; Then .....<br /><br />...a couple weeks later I got a text message saying that he misses me, thinks about me a lot, he&#039;s not happy with his new chick ... Like an idiot, I text back to say I was sorry to hear that. Then he CALLS me to whine about how she doesn&#039;t seem to want his attention (lets keep in mind that I had to fight like a Crusader for his attention), that they haven&#039;t spoken in a week, and wants to know what he should do about it. Should he try to call her and talk to her about it? What is he doing wrong? How can he fix it? He&#039;s asking me, the one he dumped not two weeks earlier like radioactive waste.&nbsp; Then he said he wanted to be friends with me, but he couldn&#039;t tell her because she knew about me and that we&#039;d been dating before they got together, so we&#039;d have to be &quot;secret friends.&quot;&nbsp; (Uh, yeah, that was his term. The guy is 39. Mature, right?) <br /><br />So I manage to pick up the fragments of my atom-bombed heart and get back out in scary Dating Land again, only to meet someone lovely, see him a few times, then get ignored for a week. So I call a couple times, send an email.&nbsp; Finally, I get a phone call back (not half an hour ago), and it&#039;s this: &quot;I think you&#039;re great, but there&#039;s something not quite right between us. I don&#039;t feel a connection ...&quot; Blah blah blah.&nbsp; Good grief. This is capping off one of the worst work weeks of my life. Not only that, the Biggest Brain application on Facebook says I have a brain the size of a cat&#039;s. So I&#039;m a high-functioning feline, and I&#039;ve eaten almost my weight in pasta for dinner, and now my stomach hurts. Payback, all of it, for pain I have caused folks in the past. I give up!!! <br /><br />(Hope you&#039;re all well; glad to be back.)

			This one is more funny than a horror story, but it certainly didn&#039;t earn him a second date. <br /><br />I was out at a club with a group, and dancing with this guy who was a friend of a friend. We were having a great time together, and we stopped for a break, and he bought me a drink. As we&#039;re chatting, out of nowhere he asks &quot;Are you Jewish?&quot;<br />I raised my eyebrows at that, but replied &quot;Why, because my name is Rachel?&quot; <br />And he says &quot;No because you have a big nos-,&quot; caught himself and replaced it with &quot;boobs&quot;<br /><br />I will be the first to tell you my chest is not at all large, but I didn&#039;t think my nose was that bad. It was worth it to see the look of horror in the guy&#039;s face after he realized what he said. He knew that he totally blew it.
