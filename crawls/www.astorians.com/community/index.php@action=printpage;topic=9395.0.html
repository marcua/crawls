				...to all of the Astorians and their family and friends who are celebrating the start of the Year of the Rat!&nbsp; I didn&#039;t even know that it started today until people who passed me in the hall were wishing me a Happy New Year.&nbsp; Being Korean and all, I guess I am supposed to be celebrating today, but I am not sure how it works.&nbsp; Do I get the day off?&nbsp; Do I have to bring envelopes with money?&nbsp; <br /><br />Has anyone gone to the celebration in Flushing that happens this Saturday?&nbsp; If so, what is it like?&nbsp; I&#039;m thinking about going, but I just wanted some feedback about event.&nbsp; Thanks.<br /><br />http://queens.about.com/cs/neighborhoods/p/2004_chinesenew.htm<br /><br />BTW, it&#039;s a bit late to post this, I guess, but Alternate Side of the Street parking rules are suspended because of the holiday.<br /><br />http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/motorist/scrintro.shtml#calendar2008<br /><br />
