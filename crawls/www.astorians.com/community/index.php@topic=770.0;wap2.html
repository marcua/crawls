			i walked by parisi bakery (broadway and 31st st) this afternoon, and a sign in the window said 'closed due to fire.' was the fire recent? the corner smelled pretty smoky. (there was also a 'we are still open' sign in the sanford diner.)

			About 2 days ago (maybe 3), while trucking back on the train, I smelled something burning as the train was around the Broadway stop. There was even a hint of smoke in the cars, which at first alarmed the crap outta me. Once we passed the station, the air in the car cleaned out. I asked my girlfriend whether she heard about a fire in the area since she lives around there. Nothing.

			Did they ever determine the cause of the fire at Thirty One and Twin Donut?
