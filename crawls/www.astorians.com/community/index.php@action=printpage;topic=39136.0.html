				<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: arial;" class="bbc_font">Thanks for posting the link AlexNYC. I read the article yesterday and have been mulling it over.<br /><br />I appreciate the sentiment expressed in the by the writer but my only thought upon finishing was sigh -- isn&#039;t a little late? I&#039;m sorry Alanna Schubach, by my standards if Astoria is &quot;over&quot; (and I&#039;m not sure what this means), it happened at least three years ago, which just so happens coincides with the time of your arrival.<br /><br />Sorry to be so blunt, but I&#039;m just really tired of discussing if Astoria is in, out, or in-between. I just don&#039;t see the point. How many threads have been started on astorians.com on this very topic, going back at least 10 years?</span></span><span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: arial;" class="bbc_font"><br /><br />I&#039;m old enough to know now that everything changes.

The rental prices are a real concern to me, but that&#039;s across the entire city, not just Astoria. I&#039;m lucky to live here, at least for now.</span></span><span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size"><br /><br />I&#039;m curious to know how others feel whether you be long-timers or new-comers.</span>

				Thanks for sharing the link to that article. I&#039;ve lived in Astoria all of my life and have been in the 30th Avenue area<br />for all of that time. I agreed with many of the points that Anwar, the woman quoted in the piece, brought up. My partner,<br />who came here from Ecuador in the mid-80&#039;s, will probably agree as well. We&#039;ve discussed this a lot in the last few<br />months as neither of us likes how the personality of the neighborhood is changing. We also dislike a lot of the new <br />construction going up - 2 examples are the new buildings under way at 29th St.&nbsp; 31st Avenue and the one on 31 St. between<br />Broadway and 31st Avenue. They don&#039;t look like affordable housing for working class like us. <br /><br /><br />Change is fine when it benefits an area and its residents, not just a select few. <br /><br /><br /><br />

I think this whole topic is more nuanced than the soundbites (Captain Obvious clued me in on that one). I&#039;m personally curious to know what the prevailing opinions were from the established population when the Italians, then the Greeks, and the North African and Middle Eastern people arrived. What was it like at, say, the turn of the 19th century? I&#039;d love to know if attitudes about newcomers and neighborhood changes are new right now or simply a repetition of what has come before. Looks like I have a research project on my hands.

				I think it&#039;s one thing when a new group moves into a neighborhood, but when that group is roughly on par with others, financially and in some cultural terms. What we&#039;ve seen recently is, I think, quite different. With rents skyrocketing over the course of only a couple of years I doubt if there have been such booms previously.<br /><br />$10 pancake.... I&#039;m tellin&#039; &#039;ya.....

				Personally, someone who has only lived in this neighbourhood for a mere three years isn&#039;t qualified to determine if the area is &quot;over&quot;.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been here nearly 19 years and actually appreciate the new businesses that are now a stones throw away from our home as a result of the gentrification.&nbsp;

				I think if you make good money and can afford Astoria then yeah Astoria is a great place to live. If you don&#039;t make too much and cannot go back to school to change careers to take on big loans again then yeah you&#039;ll have to move some place else. Those who bought homes here in the 60&#039;s 70&#039; 80&#039;s are sitting pretty well and as they pass away I&#039;m sure they will pass the property on to their children because it&#039;s literally a gold mine to own property here.

				Shop locally? Where? The only stores that remain are basically restaurants, chain store pharmacies and banks. If I wish to purchase clothes, shoes, electronics, or housewares, my options are slim to none. I either have to venture outside Astoria or shop online. Gentrification has priced out at least 90% of the longtime mom and pop stores.

				Nice rhetoric but there are hundreds of local businesses both old and new. Everything from clothing (vintage/sportsware/shoes), toys/hobby, hardware stores, new vinyl shop!, housewares, local bookstore, some really nice boutiques, not to mention dozens and dozens of bars/restaurants/nail salons/bakeries at all price points. Its a great neighborhood. Maybe you should get out there and check it out.

Artists moved in after Park Slope got too expensive after Dumbo got too expensive after East Village got too expensive etc.... And with the artists came a very cool scene, with painters, musicians, actors etc. And so the migration begins with people of more and more means moving in. As soon as the first Duane Reade showed up one knew the place was done for. And now it&#039;s a boring place like a ton of other boring places in NYC. The city used to have a ton of character, and now a lot of it is just franchises and sanitized crap. Completely uninteresting.<br /><br />But then again, a large part of the worlds population is pretty uninteresting to begin with, so this isn&#039;t exactly unexpected. It just sucks that some people have to keep moving because all the prices go up. And yes, it doesn&#039;t just include criminal elements, but also the working-class and artists.<br /><br />Williamsburg was cool at one point. Now it&#039;s insanely dull. It&#039;s even past its pretentious phase.

				When I saw this question originally, it made me think of the Time Out NY cover in 1999 that announced that Astoria was the next place to be. It took 16 years for me to meet a couple who lived in Brooklyn at the Ditmars Astoria Bier and Cheese (locally owned), who told me that they had come to Astoria because Lonely Planet had told them that Queens was the #1 destination for 2015. I was barely able to contain my laughter as I gave them directions to SriPraPhai, the next place on their list to visit in Queens.<br /><br />Williamsburg really isn&#039;t a good comparison to Astoria in any sense. Large swathes of Williamsburg were abandoned or gutted, unlike Astoria. Astoria has always had a strong middle class population, even in the &#039;70s, unlike Williamsburg, or even parts of Park Slope (remember when 9th St. in Park Slope was edgy? The abandoned buildings along 6th Avenue? Beyond that -- remember when Pierrepont St. in Brooklyn Heights had SROs??). (Aside - <span style="font-family: verdana;" class="bbc_font">Brooklyn Kitchen, which would seem to be an uber-hipster kind of joint, has a really passionate owner who lives in and is invested in his community. I don&#039;t find that sort of commitment to be &quot;insanely dull&quot;.)</span><br /><br />Like CJ, I&#039;m not an Astoria native, but I&#039;ve lived here for over 16 years, and have been spending most of my time here for over 23. I&#039;m part of a family that has been here since the 1920s, some of whom have moved away, but many of whom have lived here all along. Most of them are pretty happy with Astoria these days. A few years ago, everyone was bemoaning all of the nail salons and banks, which I get. Now, restaurants have been added to the list. <span style="font-family: verdana;" class="bbc_font">Of </span><span style="font-family: verdana;" class="bbc_font">course, there are long time stores, more and more, it seems recently, that I miss. Delis, hardware stores, pork stores, and more. There&#039;s a picture of me standing on Ditmars and 35th in about 1994 -- I think the only place that hasn&#039;t changed is Ferrari cleaners. My mother-in-law remembers King Penny. It may be the only store left on that stretch of Ditmars from 60 years ago.</span><br /><br />But, I agree with Eamonn - there are also lots of new places to shop as well, and more interesting places all around - far more than there were 5 or 10 years ago. And I&#039;m with megc -- soundbites can make for interesting reading, but they don&#039;t convey what&#039;s really happening. I know of quite a few new places that have been opened by Astoria natives or long-time residents who care deeply about their neighborhood. And even some places opened by newcomers who think it&#039;s a great neighborhood and want to contribute to it.<br /><br />But there&#039;s this -- Astoria&#039;s a real neighborhood. Walking down the street on the weekend, I revel in how many people I see that I know, how many friends I run into. On my block, I know my neighbors. This hasn&#039;t lessened as years have passed; it&#039;s grown. I meet people on the streets and in restaurants and in shops. It&#039;s pretty great. It&#039;s not dull, pretentious, or gentrified. It&#039;s life.<br /><br />Total aside - AlexNYC -- a great local place to shop for shoes (and fun accessories) is the Brass Owl, on Ditmars between 36th and 37th. I have absolutely no connection to it aside from being a very happy, satisfied customer.

These &quot;gentrification/artist/greed/used-to-be-cool&quot; conversations sound like the rants of a person who has no concept of reality.

Sports bars, Duane Reades, Starbucks, real estate offices etc is all insanely dull to me.

Do you see what I mean? The inevitability of gentrification says nothing about its effects. Heck, you even acknowledge it yourself when you say that artists lived there because it was cheap, and then tacitly acknowledge they moved because things got more expensive. That&#039;s gentrification. <br /><br />Money moves in, artists move out.<br /><br />You like it, it seems. I don&#039;t.<br /><br />As for your quip about &quot;concept of reality&quot;; that&#039;s just silly. If you read what I wrote I even stated pretty clearly that it is expected to happen.

				I guess that&#039;s it. I see it as a part of a city that is growing in population and popularity. Some changes I like, some I don&#039;t. However, as someone who grew up in the bad, old NYC I&#039;ll take the newer, cleaner, more sanitized NYC over the past version of it. My definition of ruining NYC is what happened in the 60s-90s with skyrocketing crime, mismanaged local government, corruption on all levels, organized crime owning the city, etc. Although that sense of lawlessness had its advantages, I am glad that period is over and not soon to be repeated.

There&#039;s a huge difference between a hipster and an artist/musician. The way I see it artists and musicians came to Williamsburg clearly before hipsters started showing up. These weren&#039;t the tight-pants-and-facial-hair sporting crowd, but people who could barely afford rent, therefore lived in small collectives, and lived on noodles.... so to speak. The hipster crowd is, the way I see it, those who have clearly higher disposable income, dress in &quot;hip&quot; but not inexpensive clothing, and prefer to live in good apartments rather than a converted warehouse. They might be working in media, but they aren&#039;t necessarily artists. So you might find some designers or what have you, but whereas the hipster might take a good job at a real estate firm an artist or musician at heart would rather suffocate slowly to death.<br /><br />Hipsters are pretend-artists. They are all different and unique in exactly the same way. Where a musician might buy vinyl to use in production of anything from hip-hop beats to electronica to &quot;art music&quot; the hipster buys it because it&#039;s hip, in and cool. It&#039;s different, and it&#039;s cool to be different, even if every other hipster is it the same way. And where an artist screws up their own jeans because they were done for anyway and they couldn&#039;t afford new ones a hipster is more likely to seek out a boutique that sells already distressed stuff to make it look like they&#039;re the same.<br /><br />I can see how some would confuse hipsters and artists, but they&#039;re really not the same animal.<br /><br />And <em>then</em> you have the regular crowd show up once the convenient franchises have populated the neighborhood.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=39136.msg254688.html#msg254688">Quote from: 28Grand on January 21, 2016, 03:34:18 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">My point was/is everyone is affected by rising rents, including, not just artists.

So yeah, I think there is a difference, and I apparently value different types of labor differently. But if we want to be literal about what you wrote then no group is indeed any more special than any other.

Some of my favorite places have closed down but there were always others to fill their place, or new places to enjoy and hopefully become &quot;old&quot; places. <br /><br />For the most part, there still are but recently (in the past year) some businesses I used to rely on heavily, real stalwarts, have closed and without being too dramatic, it&#039;s been a blow to me. I have to be honest though, part of what I&#039;ve been feeling is directly related to getting older.<br /><br />It&#039;s like, my favorite diner closed ...am I next to go?? <br /><br />It&#039;s ridiculous but that&#039;s how I&#039;ve been feeling. Plus, in the last year the very last of the aunts and uncles past away and now I&#039;m the part of the old generation.

				I think most people are missing the point. Astoria has gotten better. It&#039;s more exciting and there&#039;s more things to do compared to the year 1990 let&#039;s say.

				&quot;Better&quot; has different meanings for everyone. For longtime or lifetime residents like me, the changes I&#039;ve seen the last several years have not made Astoria better. Sorry, but that&#039;s how I and my partner feel. Getting back to the original article that was posted and started this discussion, I felt that the woman interviewed made some very good points. <br /><br /><br />I do remember stores like Susan Terry on Ditmars, Woolworths and Genovese. I remember when shopping for back to school clothes meant going to Steinway for things like new shoes or buying jeans in LTR. When we were kids, birthday cakes came<br />from Norgards Bakery (spelling may be wrong here, it was on 30th Avenue near 31st if I remember correctly!).<br /><br /><br />Yes, things changes and that should be a positive thing. But as I said earlier, it&#039;s not better when it only benefits a select few who only move here for convenience sake until they find something else.&nbsp;

				Gentrification basically means spiking increases in property values that ends up causing a displacement of residents and businesses of the lower and middle classes. This issue isn&#039;t just about the changes in the community, but the cost of living causes by the zoning changes is forcing out many long term residents and independent stores that can&#039;t afford the rents. Mind you the constant property tax increases by NYC are also to blame. Since 2000 the propert value of my home has gone up about 75%, but I am paying three times the property taxes, so gentrification is even affecting home owners.

				Gentrification has to mean more than rising rents and property values, because under that broad definition, that would apply to every single neighborhood in the city, including the Upper Eastside. Does anyone feel bad that the merely rich are being displaced by the megarich?<br /><br /><br />Most people, including me, are upset that Astoria rents are becoming unaffordable, but going further, I&#039;m also worry that there aren&#039;t many neighborhoods that are less expensive alternatives. It&#039;s happening everywhere. I accept this as a fact of life. <br /><br /><br />This isn&#039;t necessarily gentrification because if we&#039;re all honest -- who are these fat cats moving to Astoria pushing people out? I don&#039;t see one group of people replacing another group.&nbsp; Everyone wants to know who are these &quot;rich&quot; people who can afford to rent (or buy) but what I see is middle class people moving in -- exactly like the people who already live here. The difference is that newcomers are forced to pay a much higher percentage of there income to live here and/or double and triple up to cover the costs. Just because a person can pay it, doesn&#039;t make it affordable.<br /><br /><br />In terms of general changes, I think the neighborhood is better in many respects, more lively. There are few empty stores and the streets are bustling. We&#039;ve become a destination neighborhood in the sense that people who don&#039;t live here, come and spend money. That&#039;s why most of the bars and restaurants can survive. If they had to rely solely on locals they wouldn&#039;t I would guess. Of course there are costs to this. I have never seen the point of looking back and saying the past was better. It&#039;s dangerous.

				I also fear the increasing rents - it&#039;s made a number of people I know move out to cheaper neighborhoods, or families with kids, who want more space, move to the suburbs, but I&#039;m not sure what we can do to stop it or reign it in - it&#039;s happening almost everywhere in the city, even in parts that were considered dangerous not too far back. <br /><br /><br />I do like the new restaurants and stores though some of my favorite mom and pop shops have closed over time.&nbsp; I&#039;m still devastated that S&#039;Agapo closed when her rent was increased by over 200%.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />I still think Astoria has a community feel and you can easily get to know your neighbors.&nbsp; People I know who live in other parts of NYC do not seem to have as much of a sense of community as we find here - though you do have to work to help build and maintain it.

You don&#039;t stick around to contribute to the forum as a community member, as so many of us do here - old and new Astorians alike.

				An article about gentrification in New York City by Josh Barbanel in the Wall Street Journal online appeared this week:<br />http://www.wsj.com/articles/gentrification-effect-in-new-york-city-is-overblown-report-suggests-1462841235 (http://www.wsj.com/articles/gentrification-effect-in-new-york-city-is-overblown-report-suggests-1462841235)<br /><br />The article references a study by the NYU Furman Center that can be found here:<br />http://furmancenter.org/thestoop/entry/new-report-analyzes-new-york-citys-gentrifying-neighborhoods-and-finds-dram (http://furmancenter.org/thestoop/entry/new-report-analyzes-new-york-citys-gentrifying-neighborhoods-and-finds-dram)<br /><br />Specifically, “Focus on Gentrification”:<br />http://furmancenter.org/files/sotc/Part_1_Gentrification_SOCin2015_6MAY2016.pdf (http://furmancenter.org/files/sotc/Part_1_Gentrification_SOCin2015_6MAY2016.pdf)<br /><br />The link to the study PDF is very interesting and it’s written in what I think is accessible language (i.e. non-academic speak). I&#039;m still looking through it but think it&#039;s of interest.<br /><br />In the study, 15 neighborhoods are classified as “Gentrifying”, one of which is Astoria. Some of the findings include:<br /><br />Change in average rent in Astoria (2010-2014): +27%<br /><br />Change in average income in Astoria (2010-2014):&nbsp; +5%<br /><br />Change in non-family households in Astoria (2010-2014): +49%<br /><br />Change in Adult Population with College Degree in Astoria (2010-2014): +41%<br /><br />As we all know, rents are rising in Astoria. According to the study, in Astoria by more than the city-wide average (21%), but less than the average of other neighborhoods classified as ‘gentrifying” in the report (34%). So we are not as bad off as other gentrifying areas, some of which are poorer on average than here.<br /><br />Also from the report:<br /><span style="font-size: 0.7em;" class="bbc_size">“In short, households across New York City are experiencing significant rent pressures and shifts in household composition. Rent is going up everywhere in New York City, and at a rate faster than incomes. New Yorkers overall have become younger, more educated, and more likely to live in non-family households since 1990. These changes, however, are magnified in the city’s gentrifying neighborhoods.&quot;</span><br /><br />What do people think of the report?<br /><br />What I take away is: rents are going up, incomes are <span class="bbc_u">not</span>, more single, more educated (and mostly white) people are moving in and sharing.<br /><br />That’s probably obvious to most people who live here, but I think it’s important to note that average incomes are not rising significantly, so how people are paying those rents, and filling the bars and restaurants is anyone&#039;s guess.<br /><br />Be kind we are all neighbors.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;

A pub with good burgers will suffice. But fair enough, it&#039;s personal.<br /><br />However, part of the reason people are complaining connects with the very last thing you wrote. If that improvement is the result of more wealth moving into the neighborhood then the only conclusion is that wealth = quality. And since not everyone who lives and lived here have a high enough income to match the 24% rent increase they now get to move somewhere else, presumably then where rents again are lower and were we&#039;d again find less quality (of &quot;streets, parks&quot; etc). Is that an improvement? Yeah, if you have money to stick around.<br /><br />It&#039;s probably not a coincidence that Bernie is doing well, because a lot of people are really fed up with income not moving while costs keep creeping upwards.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=39136.msg255494.html#msg255494">Quote from: TJT on May 10, 2016, 03:25:28 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> I like the fact that Astoria is a hot area where smart, young professionals want to live.&nbsp; I also love our older, established ethnic businesses and restaurants.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />We&#039;ll see how long that lasts.

And of course some will shut down after a while. Just wait and see.

Artists moved in because it was affordable and they could actually create art and live a liberal lifestyle. Then hipsters showed up and started hiking all the prices. Then &quot;normal&quot; people, and finally the waterfront started looking like the more boring neighborhoods of Manhattan. Of course it won&#039;t be exactly the same here, or at the same pace, but there certainly will be changes. I&#039;ve already seen artists move out of here that moved here after Williamsburg got too expensive.

				Walmart won&#039;t open in the 5 boroughs. They can&#039;t get approval. Plus we already have Family Dollar which is basically the same thing. There is a Marshalls right down the street from there. It brings the worst element into Astoria. So not needed.

				I&#039;m not an Astoria original, but have been here for almost 6 years, so feel I can make a statement. <br /><br /><br />I definitely notice a difference; more white young people, baby strollers, hipster beards, and trendy food places. I also still see the diversity of cultures as well, thank god. I also still see a butchers and fish markets too, and hope that stays.<br /><br /><br />I live near 30th Ave., close to 21st. It is upsetting about all the new buildings going-up because that will do nothing but raise rents and taxes, which gives landlords the excuse to raise rents. My rent has gone up $300 in the past 5 years. I guess that&#039;s not horrible compared to others, but it went up $150 last year and I fear what the renewal will be that I&#039;ll be getting at the end of the month. I&#039;m apparently paying $200+ more less than the cheapest rents now. The cheapest 1 BRs I&#039;m seeing appear to start at $1700. Does that seem accurate? What is a non-renovated 1BR going for now? The new buildings I&#039;m sure easily go for $2000+ for a 1BR. I sold a bike to one couple a couple of years ago who paying $2000 for their 1BR is a newer building.<br /><br /><br />Gentrification happens everywhere, but I&#039;ve read that Astoria rents have increased 70%+ in the last 5 years, which is ridiculous. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				Just for giggles I went back to a diner I haven&#039;t been to in about a year. I used to be able to get egg, bacon, fries and coffee for about $6.50-7, but now I&#039;m looking at $10 once the tip is included. Same food as before. Exactly the same. Exactly as &quot;average&quot; as you&#039;d expect from a cheap diner.<br /><br />So, less value for us all.

				Rents are ridiculously. I have a rent stabilized apartment and am very glad for it. The one bedroom next door to my apartment just rented for $1750. It&#039;s a full one bedroom with a normal-size bathroom, but no kitchen. It&#039;s a kitchenette in the living room. Sorry, but I&#039;d never pay $1750 to not have a separate kitchen. I&#039;ve said before on this and other threads that I don&#039;t like the changes I&#039;m seeing. Unfortunately though, the people moving in here now have nothing to compare to the way that those who&#039;ve lived here all along do. They seem to think that $3000 rents are the norm. Well, they&#039;re not for the average working person. I don&#039;t know anyone who can afford that.

				it&#039;s been a while, but i&#039;ll respond. my rent went up $300 total in the past five years. like i said, compared to what others are paying in rent, it&#039;s not &#039;bad.&#039; my apt was $800 before 2009. i&#039;m paying about double that now, so technically i&#039;m below the average for the area now. last year it went up $150. the cost to find a new place that most likely would be higher rent and maybe in an area i wouldn&#039;t want to live, and then pay a finder&#039;s fee, was not worth it. <br /><br /><br />how is my statement &#039;sad&#039;, btw?<br /><br /><br />anyway, i just posted an article about brooklyn where tenants are forming groups to try to combat gentrification. <br /><br /><br />my LL isn&#039;t horrible, but is trying to cash-in on the popularity of astoria. he&#039;s renovated other apartments in the building after tenants move out, then jacking-up the rent. granted, they are nice upgrades, i.e., modern, granite counters, but still. the new tenants are young couples in the 1BR and young in the 2 BR. all white. he&#039;s responsed when i asked about the $150 increase was because of tax increases. eh, how can i prove that&#039;s true? he also claimed that my apt would go for a few hundred more &#039;as is.&#039; <span style="font-family: verdana;" class="bbc_font"><span style="font-size: 2px;" class="bbc_size">i have no dishwasher and the bathroom needs a serious upgrade. i am fine with this if it keeps my rent lower than average. </span></span><span style="font-family: verdana;" class="bbc_font"><span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">overall, he was defensive when i asked, which is BS. my increase this year is $50, which i can live with. it&#039;s still below market. we&#039;ll see where i&#039;m at next year.</span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: verdana;" class="bbc_font"><span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">also, one big issues is rent stablization with leases that have preferential and legal rents noted. i pay preferential. my legal rent is over $2,000. i don&#039;t know how that is calculated. the legal rent of $1,800 5 years ago was not accurate, as back then, i don&#039;t think anyone would pay that for my place. it angers me to see articles in papers, the subway, news about how great it is that there are no rent increases for 1 yr leases on rent stablized apartments. this is very misleading, as LLs can increase up to the legal rent amount, even if you&#039;re paying the preferential. so, my LL could increase my rent +$500 if he wanted.</span></span>

				Queen Boleyn: your last paragraph in your recent post is exactly correct.&nbsp; Many folks don&#039;t understand all the subtleties surrounding a rent-stabilized apartment.&nbsp; Most people think they struck gold if they land an R-S apartment, but as you say, there&#039;s the &#039;legal&#039; rent and sometimes a &#039;preferential rent&#039; than can be offered to tenants.&nbsp; Some tenants aren&#039;t told upfront, or don&#039;t understand, that the rent they are currently paying may only be the (lower) preferential rent, but that any lease renewal could suddenly come with a significant bump up to the maximum allowable (legal) rent.<br /><br />Then there&#039;s the whole issue of how long a particular apartment&#039;s rent-stabilized status is going to last.&nbsp; Some folks may not realize that just because an apartment falls under rent-stabilization today, does not necessarily mean that will be the case the next year.&nbsp; Rent-stabilization status is for a fixed time-period, and when that period ends, the rent-stabilization ends and cannot be &#039;reinstated&#039;.&nbsp; The apartment then becomes a &#039;market rate&#039; apartment.<br /><br />Queen Boleyn, what I meant by saying that it&#039;s &#039;sad&#039; you considered your $300 rent increase over 5 years to be &#039;not bad&#039; is that....for many people, such an increase over 5 years would not only be &#039;bad&#039;, but it could not be met.&nbsp; They&#039;d be forced to move out.&nbsp; As I said, it&#039;s all what we are &#039;taught&#039; by the R.E. industry, to consider &#039;normal&#039;.&nbsp; I lived in one NYC apartment from 2001-2008 and the rent never increased.&nbsp; (Granted it was not a well-maintained building...in fact, it was structurally unsound...)&nbsp; I then lived in another NYC apartment from 2008-2012, and that particular apartment building was impeccably maintained with the apartment itself being top-notch.&nbsp; And there too, the rent never increased.&nbsp; (In this place however, the particular neighborhood was not &#039;desirable&#039; the same way Astoria now is...)<br /><br />But what I&#039;m trying to say is that there are many different realities or norms, even within a nabe like Astoria.&nbsp; There are many sections of Astoria, and within those sections things can vary widely by street, by building, etc.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure many renters in Astoria have not had their rents increase for a while, and/or their rent increases have been very small.&nbsp; For other renters in Astoria, rents are going up each year, some more than others.&nbsp; Each renter has their own rental history, and their own perspective on what is to be expected when they rent...what they consider fair or &#039;normal&#039;.&nbsp; And on the higher end of the rental market (where most people are using brokers), much of this is skewed and shaped by the realtors, who naturally want to create a distorted reality, or a new normal, all to get higher rents, ergo commission.&nbsp; On the lower end of the rental market, you have people who don&#039;t use brokers but find new apartments by directly contacting building Supers (this would be in the smaller, older apt buildings in Astoria) or else they find apartments by working directly with small, older apt buildings&#039; management companies (the contact info for which is usually displayed right in the front entryway of these smaller/older buildings).&nbsp; In such instances, brokers are not involved so they can&#039;t distort the renter&#039;s perception of what is a normal/fair rent.<br /><br />Landlords and building managers are very savvy and know &#039;who&#039; their customers/renters are.&nbsp; They know the type of tenants their buildings attract, and who can afford rent increases every year and who cannot.&nbsp; &nbsp;Certain buildings and/or certain sections of Astoria know that even if a particular tenant moves out due to a rent increase they cannot afford, that they can likely attract a new tenant who WILL pay the other rent.&nbsp; Whereas there are other buildings that have such a &#039;personality&#039;, that their tenants are always on the &#039;poorer&#039; end of the pay scale, and always will be, so these buildings are less likely to try and raise rents significantly every year, because they simply know they will never attract the kinds of tenants who can or will accept that.

				thanks for your explanation on everything! i completely agree with your perspective. for me, i&#039;ve been used to a $50 increase each over the last 15 years or so i&#039;ve been a renter. i guess i see it as a standard of living increase. there&#039;s just no way i can prove that a LL is being greedy or s/he really needs to increase because of taxes, improvements, etc. i&#039;ve been lucky to not get a $300 increase that you hear some people complain about. i think you&#039;ve been quite lucky to not get any increases for the years you mentioned. i wish that was more the norm.

				<br />Thought I&#039;d share a website that can be a handy resource whenever one may be looking for a new apartment...<br /><br />This site (NYbits.com)...link for Astoria-specific info is below.... lists most/all residential apartment buildings.&nbsp; I&#039;ve used this to help me when I was looking for a new apt. in Astoria.&nbsp; The site is great in that you can search by borough, by neighborhood, and then by type of apartment/apartment building.&nbsp; <br /><br />But in looking at the Astoria list of buildings today, it seems that things may have changed a bit on the site.&nbsp; Now the only places showing &#039;available&#039; apartments appear to be luxury buildings, with prices to match.<br /><br />There are lists of what tend to have cheaper apartments (i.e., walkup buildings), but in clicking on a few I see no available apartments.<br /><br />Either way these lists can be a good starting point.&nbsp; These lists sometimes included phone numbers direct to the building management companies (though again today, in clicking on a few, I no longer see that info).&nbsp; But if you DO find phone numbers, you also need to be very dedicated to calling these places, asking if they have any vacancies or are expecting any within the next month or two, and then you need to follow-up in a few weeks.&nbsp; It requires a lot of leg work of course, if you want to find a place without a broker.&nbsp; <br /><br />Another tactic I&#039;d use (either with or without the list of apartment buildings in hand), is canvas the nabe and stand outside any building that interests you, for a few minutes.&nbsp; See if you see anyone going in or out...ask if they know if any apts available...see if you can locate bldg. manager name and tel. # near the front entrance or inside the front hallway.&nbsp; Or sometimes bldgs. have the bldg. Super&#039;s contact info.<br /><br />https://www.nybits.com/apartments/astoria_coop_buildings.html <br /><br />https://www.nybits.com/apartments/astoria-walkup-rental-buildings.html<br />

				I&#039;ve been in my rent-stabilized apartment for 38 years.

They&#039;re ridiculously high even in old walk-up buildings.<br /><br /><br />And to those whose response is &quot;if you can&#039;t afford to live here, then leave&quot;, um....NO. Like many here on this board and in Astoria, I was born and raised here and people should be able to stay here if they wish to and not be priced out.<br /><br /><br />All the construction I see now is for luxury rentals. What about for the average working single person or family? I don&#039;t <br />see any affordable housing being built for them. <br /><br />

				<br />Sadly there is no truly &#039;affordable&#039; housing being built anywhere.&nbsp; Everything is being built luxury as you say.&nbsp; <br /><br />And then there are buildings going up that purport to be &#039;mixed income&#039;.&nbsp; Even those will have a very small % of apartments for lower or middle income folks, but then the income limits are ridiculous.&nbsp; Either way you have to be very poor.&nbsp; Nothing to help the average wage-earner.<br /><br />I can&#039;t believe all the new apartment buildings going up all over Astoria.&nbsp; Nothing being discussed about how this will impact public transportation, or any plans to try and mitigate the impact via more buses, more frequent trains, pushing through that Taxi Boat they were mentioning before from Astoria over to Manhattan, etc..

				thanks for those links, yippee. i am actually aware of that site and strategy of walking about the area and looking at buildings. some list a number to contact on the building, and sometimes it&#039;s a realtor, though. but, it&#039;s definitely worth it to shop for a place that way and maybe avoid a fee. i found my place through a building manager, so i paid no fee, hehe. i&#039;m basically going to hold-on to my place for dear life and hopefully absorb no more than $50 increases each year. <br /><br /><br />unfortunately, i think many people so want to live in the next hot place, they&#039;ll take the high rents, or they&#039;re naive and/or desperate. i suspect many are coming from brooklyn, so astoria rents are &#039;cheap&#039; to them. and, i see a lot more young couples walking around. sharing a 1 BR at $2500+ would be affordable for me, technically, and cheaper than my current rent. so, i would be one of those couples. it&#039;s more expensive for we single people. i&#039;m not easily swayed by modern amenities either. i&#039;ll pay higher for modern amenities if my money builds equity, i.e., a mortgage. i feel it&#039;s a waste of money for the average middle-class renter. as long as the place is not a complete dump and the appliances are clean and work, i&#039;m happy. :wink:&nbsp;

				<br />Yes Queen, as you say, lots more young couples moving in, and indeed, a &#039;fancy, luxury apt&#039; at even $2600, is very doable for a couple to swing, versus a more basic apartment at $1900, for a single person to swing.&nbsp; (That example right there is a differential of $600/month being paid by any one person...)<br /><br />When I first moved to Astoria 4 years ago, I was one of those people that lived in a luxury building (on 21st St. right near 30th Road).&nbsp; Prior to that I&#039;d never lived in a doorman building, and the only reason I took that apartment was 1) I was desperate to get out of Glendale/Ridgewood, Queens as the commute was horrid and none of my friends would come out to visit, NOR could I ever get taxis to go there from Manhattan (too far).&nbsp; 2) The realtor that showed me the Astoria place was &#039;smart&#039; enough to show me the place at night.&nbsp; I got one look at the view of the Manh. skyline from my windows and I was enthralled and....3) I figured I&#039;d do a bit of Airbnb to help swing the rent.<br /><br />Well after two years of living there I decided to move out.&nbsp; It was too stressful &#039;having&#039; to do Airbnb and hoping no one would find out. (Whenever I rented out via Airbnb I was always there at the same time to host/supervise the guests.&nbsp; I&#039;d sleep on futon couch in living room while they got bedroom...)&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, the high rent simply left a bad taste in my mouth...the fact of whether or not I could actually afford it aside.&nbsp; Paying $2400 (and this was two years ago) for a 1BR in Astoria seemed unconscionable to me.&nbsp; Obviously I love Astoria but still, it&#039;s Astoria.&nbsp; Who do these places think they are charging that kind of money?&nbsp; In addition, the building loved to tout itself as offering rent-stabilized apartments, but again, that term in and of itself can be loaded with confusion.&nbsp; They still raised the rent every year and while granted there was a cap on how much they could raise it, when the rent is already $2400, well you can see that even with a 2% increase each year, the new rent price begins to border on insane.<br /><br />Then there was the building itself...how it was made...the quality of the fixtures, the design, etc.&nbsp; I began to eventually see beyond the &#039;modern, clean lines, all white decor&#039;, and that this was just another cookie-cutter modern soul-less building, with all the cliché &#039;modern amenities&#039; thrown in to appeal to a certain clientele (doorman, very generic &#039;fitness center&#039;, finished rooftdeck complete with gas grills, outdoor couches, and even...outdoor showers??!), washer/dryer inside every apartment (which to me was utterly wasteful.&nbsp; I&#039;d much rather have another closet versus a washer/dryer taking up space in my apt.&nbsp; I would have been very happy to just have a small laundry room on every floor.&nbsp; Even THAT would have been a luxury to me, as my entire life I&#039;ve been a Laundromat person. ;-)&nbsp; <br /><br />Then there was the fact that within one year or so of the building being built, opening up for rentals, and being filled with tenants...within a year or so, new owners/management bought the building and there was a changeover of some rules and some of the staff.&nbsp; <br /><br />The doormen were clearly treated like chattel by management.&nbsp; Of course, I was always very nice to the doormen...would sometimes offer them a plate of food or a cold drink in the summer...they didn&#039;t even have a mini-fridge for the doormen, so I actually found one for them on Craigslist and arranged to have it delivered and kept in their little &#039;closet&#039; of a room, where the doormen could keep their bags, jackets, etc.&nbsp; The doormen would tell me of instances where they were &#039;told&#039; they had to work a double shift because another doorman called in sick, etc.&nbsp; Many of these doormen also had second jobs where they were doormen at other buildings, and most of these guys lived in other boroughs (i.e., the Bronx or Brooklyn) and&nbsp; so travelled great distances to/from their various jobs.<br /><br />Add this all up, and I decided that while I could technically afford to live in such a building, I just didn&#039;t like spending that much of my income on rent, and in such a soul-less building.&nbsp; I also never liked living on 21st Street with all that traffic and industrial feeling.&nbsp; Blech.<br /><br />That&#039;s when I went on a very serious mission to find a new place.&nbsp; It was exhausting...I posted on FB and told all my friends to ask all their friends for any leads.&nbsp; I walked the streets of Astoria, peering into apt buildings for bldg. mgmt. info....I&#039;d wait outside buildings and question tenants.&nbsp; And I also worked with a few brokers, telling them my criteria.&nbsp; (I was looking to pay $600 less, or $1800, for a 1BR.)&nbsp; <br /><br />It was an extremely stressful two months of searching, but I finally found a place... a 3rd floor walkup in a small apt. building with 8 units, and where the LL lives with his family.&nbsp; I&#039;m in a totally different part of Astoria...by Ditmars/Steinway...and much prefer it to 21st St./30th Ave.&nbsp; I&#039;m now back to Laundromat life, and while it sure was nice for 2 years to be able to do my own laundry buck-naked, any hour of the day or night, in my own apartment, I&#039;ll take this new living situation over my old &#039;luxury&#039; one, any day.&nbsp; ;-)<br />

				Astoria is gentrifying and for sure, rents are no longer working class.&nbsp; New construction - only for people with a really good amount of money.&nbsp; Shops - yes there are some, but truly - where could you buy clothing on Steinway, if you are not into NY &amp; Co. and housewares?&nbsp; I don&#039;t see any Williams Sonoma anywhere nearby or even a K-Mart, Walmart, Target or anything of the like that sells some kind of quality housewares.&nbsp; One of those stores (the last 3) would give Steinway the shot in the arm it needs to become a better shopping area and it would draw people from all over to shop there and encourage other retailers to join in.&nbsp; Who wants to start a campaign.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had enough of eyeglass places, dollar stores and junk clothing stores on Steinway.

Once we have a good amount of retail dollars to spend, the retailers will appear. As of now, Steinway looks more like Junction Blvd. than a part of Astoria. Since I have been coming to Steinway (over 20 years), it seems to have gone down in quality.

				+1 Eamonn<br /><br /><br />@astoriagirl:<br />Steinway has gone downhill over the past 30 years.&nbsp; Needs a shot in the arm but a discounter like Walmart isn&#039;t going to do it (and there isn&#039;t anyplace with enough parking for them anyway).<br />Need some mid-level stores like Banana Republic and as you mentioned Williams Sonoma and maybe a couple of nice restaurants to get new shoppers onto the street.&nbsp; With new residents and newer higher priced buildings, these will eventually follow.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				With the exception of Straus Hardware, I can&#039;t remember the last time I actually bought something on Steinway Street. There is no decent clothing store, or men&#039;s shoes, or housewares, or basic sundries for the home. Chain stores like Duane Reade or CVS doesn&#039;t help the situation. While I prefer to do my business with independent local merchants, there are little to none that have the basics, so I don&#039;t have an alternative but to buy much of stuff I need online. Most property owners keep holding out for chain stores who are willing to pay higher rents,&nbsp; which is what drove out the mom and pop stores and the boutique stores, which was what made Steinway Street a shopping destination for decades.&nbsp; Greed and gentrification is making the cost of living situation unaffordable in Astoria for working and middle class people.

The issue holding down Steinway is people from outside of the neighborhood patronizing businesses that don&#039;t reflect the local Astoria population. If the area didn&#039;t have direct access to the M,R you&#039;d see a totally different set of stores.

				Well, considering the thread topic, wishing for Banana Republic etc to open up certainly isn&#039;t solving the problem, only making it far worse. How many more bland neighborhoods does a city need? Eradicating the uniqueness in favor of those types of stores is exactly the problem with gentrification, in addition to unreasonable price-hikes.

				Well I&#039;d rather have a Banana Republic, Williams Sonoma, and maybe some other shops like a Saks Off Fifth instead of the hookah lounges that seem to have taken over the GCP end of Steinway.&nbsp; Depending on the length of their leases, that end of Steinway may not recover for decades.
