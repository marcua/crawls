				It’s Fall and Astoria/LIC International Film Festival is back, bringing its crème de la crème selection to indie film buffs.&nbsp; It’s a three-day event, featuring over 50 films from around the world plus special treats:&nbsp; music videos, stand-up comedy, live music and even circus performances!&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><div style="text-align: left;">(http://www.astorialicff.com/)The festival drew about 800 viewers last fall, but has grown since. This year, movie highlights include a Swedish horror flick, <strong>Marianne</strong>, which originally premiered at the 2011 Fantasia International Film Festival (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasia_Festival). Directed by Filip Tegstedt, the film is a harrowing tale of a widower coping with a newborn, a teenage girl who blames him for her mother’s death and the nightmares that affect his ability to separate dreams from reality.</div><br /><br />Shot in DUMBO, Brooklyn, and directed by Colin Rivera, <strong>The End of Something is</strong> a hyperlocal story of young artists struggling to keep afloat the failing Black Box theater, and discovering just how far they’re willing to go, individually and collectively, while putting on one last show.<br /><br /><strong>Recess</strong>, a short directed by Bradley Montesi brings back a familiar topic: kids can be cruel and making friends isn’t easy.&nbsp; In just three minutes, this insightful short re-examines the rough confines of jungle gyms and swings.<br /><br /><br />Documentary<strong>, I Rub New York</strong> is, in the film’s own words, “the story of one artist’s passion and how it touched an entire city one block at a time.” Carol Caputo has spent three decades creating, and encouraging others to help create, a “textural database” by taking impressions city’s surfaces.<br /><br /><br />Dubbed &quot;The United Nations of New York City” with people from 120 countries living and working in this diverse neighborhood, the Astoria/LIC area is a great host for this international film fest. Artists of all disciplines live and create in Long Island City, which is also home to Silvercup Studios, Kaufman Astoria Studios and The Museum of the Moving Image.&nbsp; The Astoria/LIC International Film Festival builds upon the LIC’s artistic community, promoting new and emerging voices in film, spoken word and art.<br />&nbsp;<br />The festival will commence with the Opening Night gala Friday, October 14<sup>th</sup> at&nbsp; &nbsp;the Z Hotel and conclude with the Fan Awards ceremony on the evening of Sunday, October 16<sup>th</sup>. Films will be screened at three venues:&nbsp; Secret Theatre, The eGarage and Astoria’s Variety Boys and Girls Club with a jitney bus service provided.<br />&nbsp;<br />“We had a great turnout last year, and this time we’ve partnered with Groupon and Living Social to promote our filmmakers in every borough,” says Dennis Cieri, the festival founder and a filmmaker himself. “We also partnered with RCN, which will show the winning films on their network – a terrific opportunity for filmmakers to get noticed!&nbsp; It’s the indie festivals where you meet all the future stars.”<br /><br /><br />Other festival sponsors include the Z Hotel, Morales Soukeras Attorneys-at-Law, Capital Glass and Sash Co, Variety Boys and Girls Club of Queens, and Ultimate Sound Installations.<br /><br /><br />For tickets and schedule, visit http://www.astorialicff.com/ (http://www.astorialicff.com/) or AstoriaLICFilmFestival&nbsp; page on Facebook.
