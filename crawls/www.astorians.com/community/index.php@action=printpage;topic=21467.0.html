				... and yes, I&#039;ve seen 3 different brokers so far and they are all saying &quot;there&#039;s a shortage in apartments in Astoria&quot; and they&#039;ve never seen anything like it before.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if they are trying to scare me or if it&#039;s real...

				The realtors that we&#039;ve been working with have been saying the same thing.... so I don&#039;t think they&#039;re trying to scare you.&nbsp; August seems like a tough month for apartments in general.&nbsp; Any decent inventory that is available is quickly snatched up and landlords are jacking up the prices like crazy due to the demand.&nbsp; Apparently there are small one bedrooms now going for 1900 which is ridiculous... and just because they&#039;ve been renovated with marble countertops.<br /><br />I would definitely try craigslist though... we lucked out on our apartment by going that route. The apartment in the ad wasn&#039;t available by the time we walked into the office, but the realtor had just gotten a fresh listing that was perfect for us in every way.<br /><br />August seems a little early to search for an Oct 1st apartment.&nbsp; Hopefully there will be a better inventory in September.&nbsp; Good luck.
