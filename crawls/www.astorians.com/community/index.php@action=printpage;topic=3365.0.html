				I went up the stairs at Bway around 8.50 thinking that I couldn&#39;t hear a train and that was good as I hate running for the train and/or just missing it.<br /><br />Then I got up on the platform and there *was* a train. It was just sitting there. After I sat down and waited a while an announcement was made that the conductor in front of us was walking around the train and checking under all the cars. WTF? Clearly I missed something. Anyone know what?

				3rd day in a row morning rush hour is screwed up on W line.&nbsp; Today, I take an N to Union Square.&nbsp; No problems getting there.&nbsp; Then, a W shows up on the EXPRESS track.&nbsp; WTF?!?!&nbsp; The conductor doesn&#39;t let us know whether the train is going to Brooklyn, or will be going to City Hall and Rector Street.&nbsp; So I don&#39;t hop on it, for fear I&#39;ll wind up in Brooklyn.&nbsp; Then, AFTER the train leaves, an announcement is made that there is a broken down R train at 34th street, and R and W trains are running local from 34th street?!?!?!&nbsp; But they are showing up on the EXPRESS track!!!&nbsp; So I have no choice, and hop on the next R that shows up at union square.&nbsp; We get to Canal.&nbsp; Absolutely inaudible announcement from the conductor.&nbsp; Everyone on the train starts booking out of the train as the doors are closing as we&#39;re worried we&#39;ll all end up in Brooklyn.&nbsp; Finally, after several people get jammed by the doors, a loud announcement saying that it&#39;s going to City Hall.<br /><br />Arrrrrrrrrrgggghhh!!!!!&nbsp; MTA is really pissing me off these days. :ticked: :ticked: :ticked:

				Ask your boss if it can be stashed in an office or the mailroom, and once you get into the routine it&#39;s so easy.

				The city is supposed to be adding 200 more miles of bike lanes eventually, which ought to get more people riding, in turn getting employers to take bike access into consideration. <br /><br />I&#39;m lucky at my present job, but will be switching to a new job in about two weeks. Luckily, the people I&#39;ve been interviewing with have also been serious bikers. Yesterday, the woman interviewing me showed me her bike <em>tattoo </em>&nbsp; :-) <br /><br />So there&#39;s hope for more alternatives to the stupid train.

				As a woman who cannot wear the color yellow, my office will be moving from Wall St to midtown this month. Considering the difficult I have getting to the gym, I am having some thoughts about biking. Of course I&#39;d have to buy a bike and all the related accoutrements and build a little stamina and muscle first.

				<em>Christine, how many days a week do you bike to work and how far is it? My concerns are expense, showing up sweaty and gross at work, unexpected bad weather and of course the risk of injury. What are your thoughts?</em><br /><br />I bike as often as possible when it&#39;s not raining (although I&#39;m working up the courage to bike in the rain.) My commute is only about four miles each way into the city. If I ride every day, that&#39;s automatically 40 miles/week under my belt between the hours of 8am-6pm.<br /><br />What&#39;s nice is that I work right in Central Park, so after work, I do laps. Each lap is about six miles. My best week I did a total of 100 miles (commuting + laps.) This has helped me stay in good shape for mountain bike races- I ride my mtb instead of a road bike for the added challenge. At first I didn&#39;t think riding on pavement would do much, but when I did a 40-mile mtb race on a tough course last month, I felt pretty good and even placed second in my division&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />As for not being too sweaty: I&#39;ll take a quick shower, dress in bike clothes, and pack work clothes. I also pack makeup and moist towelettes, and keep a pair of shoes at work (though it&#39;s casual and I can get away with black Sketchers.) I get to work and allow about 10-20 min. to stop sweating and cool down (depending on heat/humidity.) <br /><br />You have to be careful and pay close attention, but city traffic isn&#39;t much faster than a bike anyway&nbsp; :wink: The rush is addictive once you get used to it.<br /><br />

				Train troubles are usually in the morning, but if it&#39;s raining, the MTA likes to shut down service to Queens to make our lives more &quot;exciting&quot; or is that &quot;interesting&quot;.&nbsp; I love walking over the bridge, but prefer to choose when to do it.

				ugh<br />i got to the R/V Steinway stop 10 minutes earlier today (8:25). Since we moved further downtown i can only take the R. a V comes in right away. i wait 20 more minutes and a super packed smushed to the door R comes in. then a slightly less packed v and then i wait until 8:40 for the next R and that&#39;s pretty full too. 10 minutes late to work today. There wasn&#39;t a single solitary announcement, and i wasn&#39;t listening to my ipod so i know i didn&#39;t miss something. i read most of the amny before i got on the train. <br />

				Here&#39;s a fun train story that doesn&#39;t involve the N/W, for once.<br /><br />This morning, the 7 train I was riding overshot the Grand Central station and came to an abrupt stop. The conductor came on and said that we should all get off at the next station. It&#39;s nice to know that the driver was too busy daydreaming or whatever to pay attention to the signals- I&#39;m positive he ran one. It&#39;s a good thing the 7 train wasn&#39;t backed up or we could have been in an accident.

				And to think I was wishing I&#39;d taken the N/W instead of the R this morning (I went to the bank to make a deposit - 45 minutes of waiting - durn Commerce Bank!).<br />The R was also quite slow this morning - maybe they&#39;re doing a slowdown of some sort?&nbsp; Three Rs went towards Forest Hills and a V, and no train had come towards Manhattan, because as you know, no one really wants to be to work on time.

				I must say, I really wish that the MTA was better about publicizing outages. Not just what&#39;s currently out of service, but what outages there have been in the past, say, 24 hours. It would be nice to know that there&#39;s a stalled W train, and it would also be nice to know that the stalled W train has been cleared, and that there are residual delays. That information should be updated by the minute and should be available on the web. (And booth agents should have a little computer with that information too.) Aggregate information should be made available in a downloadable database for the Straphangers folks to analyze. If the MTA was a city agency, you can bet statistics-crazy Bloomberg would have made that happen. Way better information is available for drivers than for subway riders.<br /><br />My other gripe is that there should be buses in constant reserve to pick up the slack when there are outages. East river tunnels flooding again? No worries, just triple the number of busses going over the triborough and queensboro bridges. <br /><br />Failures are part of any complex system like the world&#39;s largest subway system, and the MTA does relatively well at minimizing them given the age of the tracks and some of the trains, but they&#39;re not very good at working around problems or making customers feel like they&#39;re being taken care of.

				I just wish that the booth agents and random MTA employees on the platforms knew what was going on at any one time. Its enough that announcements on trains are lacking or garbled or just plan wrong. But no one ever seems to know anything when you straight-up ask them! There was once a track fire on the J/M/Z, and you could <em>see</em> it from the Myrtle stop, and when I asked the dude with the orange vest, he was like &quot;hell, I don&#39;t know&quot;. Um, okay. How about &quot;track fire&quot;? And how many times have you asked a booth operator &quot;are the trains even running?&quot; and s/he is like &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;. Do they know anything? I mean, <em>you&#39;re in a booth. With a radio.</em> JeebusChrist. It might be too much to ask the MTA to keep realtime online listings of service interruptions when the actual people on the ground have no clue themselves.

(An friend-of-a-friend is the primary webmaster, and he know&#39;s what&#39;s up...) <br /><br />This said, the MTA is so freakin&#39; archaic in its management that there&#39;s no chance that this could happen. <br /><br />Annie, my thought was that the same system (or different views of the same data) should be available to both MTA booth folks and the web-browsing public...<br />

				Amen to what Harlan said.&nbsp; Reserve buses would be so helpful and knowing when the next train is coming, and what is causing the delay, would make the experience much more bearable.&nbsp; I don&#39;t think the MTA should be run by the State, I think it should be more decentralized and run by the City as the people on the MTA board often don&#39;t live in the city and don&#39;t have to use the system (and don&#39;t use it) making them less empathetic and understanding of the problems.

				For there to be reserve buses, there would have to be reserve drivers, though, wouldn&#39;t there?&nbsp; (It seems like the a-certain-number-of-people-work-each-shift system would make calling up extra busses difficult.)&nbsp; They could institute a system by which they gave bus drivers beepers so they would be on call.&nbsp; The obvious next step in this plan is that they would make a Gray&#39;s Anatomy-type tv show about the bus drivers.&nbsp; E.g. &quot;We need all the bus drivers to 59th street, stat!&quot;, and intense conversations in the elevator, and a character called McBusdrivery.<br /><br />Clearly someone needs to get back to doing actual work now.&nbsp; I&#39;m not going to say who that person is.

				Well I know when I got on the N to Manhattan a little after 2pm this afternoon, the N wasn&#39;t even going past Queensboro because of emergency track work. I had to transfer to the 7 and take that to Times Square, and then transfer to an uptown N to get to 57th street. There were no N/W between Queensboro and 57th Street. I would imagine that&#39;s at least part of why trains were so bad during rush hour, and I think they stopped W service completely because of it. Dunno what happened to the tracks, though.

				I&#39;m really not so bothered by the 7 train -- yes, it is narrower than the N/R/W, but that&#39;s because it was originally part of the IRT, whereas the N/R were part of the BMT.&nbsp; Here&#39;s (http://www.nycsubway.org/faq/briefhist.html) a brief history, and here&#39;s (http://www.nycsubway.org/faq/oldlines.html) a list of current lines matched with the three original transit agencies -- IRT, BMT and IND.<br /><br />The cars on the 7 are the same dimensions as those on the 4/5/6, and I find the 7 to be less crowded than say, the 6 at rush hour.&nbsp; I used to work right across the street from Grand Central, as well as at 6th Ave. and 44th, so I have often taken the 7 at peak rush.&nbsp; Meg, you should have seen it when they were running the old Redbirds!&nbsp; Here (http://www.nycsubway.org/cars/redbird-scrap.html), btw, is a great page of photos of the Redbirds as they were stripped and prepared for becoming reefs.&nbsp; I have to say that as someone who rode those cars on many lines countless times, this photo (http://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?28907) is just spooky.<br /><br />Last night was horrible, though.&nbsp; I caught the N as it was pulling into the station at Lex, so I didn&#39;t wait like aquaecny and thatjimguy did, but I noticed how crowded the platform was (at about 4:40), and I knew something was up.&nbsp; I suppose if there had been no service between Queensboro and 57th St. earlier in the day it makes some sense that the trains were bunched up at Ditmars that needed to be cleared.&nbsp; Otherwise, it really didn&#39;t make sense that others were waiting so long for trains, and then the conductor is trying to tell us that we&#39;re stopped because there are trains ahead!&nbsp; It took about 45 minutes to get to Ditmars from Lex, I think.

				Yeah, there were yellow signs up saying there was no N service past Queensboro yesterday from 10am to 3pm. And then I know from Victorine that there were a series of minor maintenance/sick passenger/etc issues at around 4pm at Queensboro. And then I figure they just got backed up at Ditmars and couldn&#39;t get un-backed-up because they didn&#39;t have enough drivers to increase the rate at which they turned around trains. In any case, it took 20+ minutes to get from 30th Ave to Ditmars at 7:30 last night... That was still much less backed up than earlier, though. Hope it&#39;s fixed today!<br /><br />And I still wish that the MTA had a maintenance blog or something that reported both what&#39;s currently down and what caused earlier outages! <br /><br />Oh, from subtalk.com (http://www.subchat.com/read.asp?Id=357548): &quot;emergency g.o.<br />broken rail at or near queensboro plaza. the work was supposed to be done 10am-3pm. it got screwed up royally. somehow they had all the crews in brooklyn and the trains in astoria waiting to finally go through to manhattan. there was no service for like 45 min so they turned trains south in manhattan. a few M&#39;s were sent in service all the way down the N to stillwell ave.&quot;<br /><br />Figures...<br /><br /><br />

				When comparing frequency of service, I think the number 7 train comes every 2-3 minutes, whereas the NW comes about every 10-20.&nbsp; I take the NW after 10pm frequently and on the weekends, and I&#39;m always waiting 20-40 minutes for a train to arrive, whereas when I take a 7 train on the weekends or at night, I still never wait more than 5 minutes.&nbsp; Why is this?&nbsp; Why are there more 7 trains compared to NW trains?&nbsp; Yes, it may be a more crowded commute during rush hour on the 7 but there are still more trains, and plus, the NW is more crowded at Queensboro Plaza than at Ditmars, and boarding at Broadway must be pretty bad too.&nbsp; There are plenty of mean cranky passenger to go all around the subway lines.&nbsp; The 456 is pretty awful too.

				I took the E train out to JFK yesterday and had the strangest experience.&nbsp; First I walked to the train station at Steinway, thinking I would catch the R to the express station and hop to an E.&nbsp; Lo and behold, not one but <em>two</em> - two! - G trains came at once in opposite directions.&nbsp; I almost didn&#39;t know what to do, I&#39;ve only seen a G train at Steinway once or twice, but I decided to hop on, figuring it was going the right way, and it did exactly what I wanted it to do.&nbsp; At the express station I hopped off and while waiting for the E, saw yet another G train going in the opposite direction.&nbsp; My god.&nbsp; I&#39;ve never in my life heard of anyone seeing three G trains in the span of ten minutes. <br /><br />I know they were talking about improvements on the line, but never thought it would happen so soon.&nbsp; Was this just a freak incident?&nbsp; Or are they improving weekend service on the G? <br /><br />I&#39;d love more G train service, especially to Brooklyn - it&#39;s such a pain to have to go into Manhattan just to get to places in Brooklyn.

I think the 7 train is the most frequently running train in the city though.

				Thank you. I left my apt, which is one block from the 36th Ave stop, at 8:10am and walked into my office at 9:30 this morning. And I only have to go 3 stops. WTF? First I couldn&#39;t get on the train as it was packed. Then their was a red signal and the N train I was on sat waiting to enter QBP.&nbsp; Then the train in front of us at at QBP had door trouble.&nbsp; Once we get to QBP, wouldn&#39;t you know it, a 7 train enters at the same time.

				All the subway steps I&#39;ve encountered over the last couple days have been horrendous. Did the city forget how to deal with snow? I don&#39;t remember it being this bad just to get in and out of the subway in the last couple years. And walking around the city yesterday was awful; I had an unexpectedly large amount of free time in the afternoon, and I didn&#39;t even want to go anywhere because it would&#39;ve required playing the puddle/snow pile guessing game when crossing every street for hours after the snow was done. We didn&#39;t even get that much snow, so there&#39;s no excuse for it to have been that bad.

				I got to the Steinway St R station a bit after 9am this morning (Thurs). A V train was just pulling out, which was perfect because usually that means an R is coming next. So I wait...and wait...and wait. It&#39;s about 9:15, and 2 V trains come and go. At this point the platform is packed. No announcements telling us what&#39;s going on. At 9:30 I decide to go call work and tell them that, yet again, I will be late. An R train finally came...at about 9:35. Sigh.<br /><br />I usually take the W after work because I like to pick up a few things up on Broadway on the way home. I&#39;ve noticed that this week it seems to be running, um...rarely? I think I grabbed one on Monday night, but Tuesday, Wednesday and tonight there was an announcement telling us that &quot;W service has been suspended for the night. Please take an R or N train as an alternate route.&quot; Thanks...that would be great if the N train stopped at the City Hall Station!!&nbsp; :ticked: <br /><br />Is there somekind of track work going on that I&#39;m not aware of? Since when does the W stop running on weeknights?<br /><br />I know I should probably just leave 20 - 30 minutes early in the morning from now on, but that really pisses me off. I don&#39;t expect perfection, but dammit, I would like the trains to run on a somewhat reliable schedule. Why is this so much to ask??

				You all have to start getting on the train by 7:45!&nbsp; By my observations, that is when it starts to get crowded and annoying!&nbsp; 7:30 is a good time, not overly crowded, but not completely empty either.

				Leaving ealier does help, but 7:45 am to get to work by 9:00 in Midtown?! I can literally walk from my front door to midtown (over the 59th Street Bridge) and to my office in those 75 minutes.There&#039;s something seriously wrong with a public transportation system when it&#039;s quicker to walk than to commute. Today I had trouble getting to work (3rd time this week) and problems getting home also. No wonder the N/R has been rated the worst line in NYC 3 years running.

				I get on the R at Rector St. in downtown Manhattan. At 4:25 PM they announced that there were no W trains running because of a &quot;switch problem&quot; I believe.&nbsp; Of course, the PA told passengers to simply take the R to 14th Street where they could transfer to the N.&nbsp; By the time we got to 59th Street, around 5 or so, it seemed like half of Queens was waiting on the platform and didn&#039;t appear as if a lot people were getting on the R.&nbsp; <br /><br />Having written all of that, I have no idea what happened to the N!&nbsp; &nbsp; :-(

				Our computer network at work went out around 3 this afternoon, and since I needed to sqeeze in a quick trip to the dentist sometime today, I figured that was a good time. I got to the 5th Ave stop, downtown side, and there were a lot of people waiting. They made an announcement:&nbsp; &quot;due to a single problem downtown, trains are running very slowly from Queens to Manhattan.&quot;&nbsp; This made no sense, until I figured out that she had mis-read her script, which read, &quot;Due to a signal problem, downtown trains are running....&quot;<br /><br />The train came not too long after that, but my tech woes have continued, as we got home tonight to discover our internet and cable completely out, and they say the earliest they can send someone is NEXT MONDAY!!!!! :angry:

				A poster at subchat.com reports that at least one of our favorite new R160 trainsets was caught in flood waters in the Coney Island yard where the sets in service are being stored and serviced.&nbsp; What really blows is that these new cars are so high tech and computerized just how much damage has been done to that train.&nbsp; This train was submerged above the wheels and below the doors, so we pray for limited damage.&nbsp; But this all speaks volumes against MTA, which apparently can&#039;t keep it&#039;s trains secure in it&#039;s own storage yards.

Once that market becomes sane again, the MTA will have huge structural problems, with interest on the debt from their improvements since the 1970s increasing yearly to nearly 20% of their budget. Less than half of the MTA&#039;s budget comes from fares. Fares roughly cover current payroll, but not equipment, debt service, pensions, health care, etc.<br /><br />http://www.streetsblog.org/2007/05/04/russianoff-on-the-mta-fiscal-crisis-congestion-pricing-and-transit/#more-1635 (http://www.streetsblog.org/2007/05/04/russianoff-on-the-mta-fiscal-crisis-congestion-pricing-and-transit/#more-1635)

				The N/W line stopped for a while today due to a stalled train at 36th Avenue. I was on that train, and it sucked. Actually it started messing up at the Broadway stop, repeatedly coming to an abrupt stop and then jarring to a start again. It did this about 4 times before finally stopping at Broadway. Then it sat there for a couple minutes and they said they were being held due to mechanical problems. After about 5 more minutes, they told us all to leave the train because it was going out of service. We were told the next train would be making all stops. So we all went out to the platform and that train pulled away. There was another train sitting at 30th Avenue just waiting to pull in, but it wasn&#039;t moving. A couple trains went towards Ditmars. Then another Ditmars bound train came in, and then that train just sat there. <br /><br />We all waited outside for about 15 minutes with no announcement, and finally waiting seemed pointless so I walked down the street to the R train. Lots of people were still waiting. I wonder when they finally announced to those people that service had been suspended between Ditmars and 42nd street due to the stalled train at 36th Avenue.

				What&#039;s the deal with no air-conditioning in the morning on the trains? Most of the trains have absolutely no AC from Ditmars to 39th Avenue, then at Queensboro Plaza they turn it on. This was a trend they started doing last year. I wear a suit so I get all hot and sweaty by the timewe get to QBP. <br /><br />Does this mean the Queens passengers don&#039;t deserve AC, but Manhattan riders do? :|

				I haven&#039;t noticed that either, but I don&#039;t ride the train until around 1pm so maybe that&#039;s why. It always seems like it&#039;s on full-blast to me. But you may be right, maybe they do that at certain times, since late last summer they also started the thing where they close all the doors except for one when the train is sitting at the station on the last stop. They do this on the Q train at 57th and also the N/W at Ditmars, not sure about the others but I would assume it&#039;s a system-wide thing. Maybe they figure that because the train is above ground it doesn&#039;t get as hot as it does when below ground, but it seems like a bad idea to do away with it completely because it still gets damn hot, especially during rush hour. Gross. I agree, contact them asking what&#039;s up with that.<br /><br />I don&#039;t get why it has to be set so cold, anyway. I&#039;m always freezing in my t-shirt on the train in the summer.

				What was going on late Thursday night?&nbsp; I was at Times Square around 10:45-11 PM, waiting forever for an N train.&nbsp; A couple of Q trains and an R train came, then the next R train was being rerouted to the F line through the 63rd Street tunnel.&nbsp; The N that came after that was terminating at 59th/Lex.&nbsp; I gave up and split a cab back to Astoria with 2 other people.

				Another nutty morning on the N.&nbsp; Where was the train with &quot;mechanical difficulties&quot; around 8-8:15?&nbsp; There was a huge crowd at Broadway, and after a while we were told to crossover to the Ditmars-bound side and take a train to Astoria Boulevard, where we could catch an express.&nbsp; I just walked over to Steinway, though the R was running slowly too.

				Some mornings I really hate the N/W lines.&nbsp; They sent 5 trains towards Ditmars this morning as folks lingered on the platform and it got crowded.&nbsp; You know when they do that, they&#039;re going to start skipping stops on the way in to catch up - so folks start getting antsy and aggravated.&nbsp; What is wrong with the MTA folks who work at the Ditmars Station?&nbsp; Can&#039;t they get their act together?&nbsp; It shouldn&#039;t be so hard to keep trains running regularly.

				Got a call from my boyfriend 15 minutes before I normally leave, warning me that I should leave early and/or be prepared for delays. Spent about 20 minutes on an N at Ditmars, on a train which was supposed to terminate at Queensboro Plaza (where all 8 million riders would have to take the 7, likely also packed). 80% of us pushed our luck, and the train left Queensboro and headed straight into the city. I was 15 minutes late, but so was everyone else, and I got to finish my book on the train. <br /><br />Irritating, but not as bad as yesterday to me (maybe only because I was forewarned).

				Before I left home this morning I attempted 3 times to go online on the MTA site to see whether they had service announcements, but like their train, it wasn&#039;t running. Their site was down, appearently they couldn&#039;t handle the volume of visitors. So I left home to brave my commute with no info. I waited about 40 minutes on the platform, just as I gave up and head for the stairs I saw a train approaching. Luckily I managed to just barely fit in.&nbsp; It was murder at each subsequent stations, too many people who refused to understand there was literally no more room for anybody. It got to the point where I felt pain from people pusing. One guy elbowed me in the ribs to force his way in and I saw stars. I cursed and elbowed him back sharp in the kidneys and he doubled over and I pushed him back out. I dared him to attempt it again and he stayed away. <br /><br />As we approached Queensboro Plaza the conductor announced that it would probably be the last stop. Just before the doors opened he confirmed that riders going to Manhattan have to take the 7 train. Half the train emptied out including me. Then about 3 minutes later, without any further announcment on the platform, the doors closed and the train pulled out towards Manhattan. I was livid. It took 4 more 7 trains before I could get on board. I got to work after 2 hours and 10 minutes. I could have walked it in 1 hour 20 minutes. <br /><br />Piss-poor communication and bad management is the main problem with the MTA when there is a problem. They just don&#039;t know how to handle a situation or crisis. It didn&#039;t used to be anywhere near this bad, so I blame the current people who are in charge of MTA.

				The day of the mass flooding was awful.

The station guy at 46th couldn&#039;t tell us if the N/W was running-which is almost a mile a way. Not that I wouldn&#039;t walk it but it was so ugh out that to get there and find out it wasn&#039;t running would&#039;ve sucked. he also couldn&#039;t tell us if the 7 was running-a mile in the other direction. so we didn&#039;t chance it. <br />Here&#039;s where &quot;my commute gets worse than any of yours&quot; (picture a whiny bratty kid saying it :) )<br />On our 4th attempt checking the train station-11:30 at this point (luckily work is somewhat flexible with this sort of thing)&nbsp; i stepped on a bad crack right outside the station (46th st...the tore up part outside the queens bound stairs) i rolled my ankle and ate the pavement. Resulting in a Sprained freakin Ankle! That I had to walk back home on. and up 2 flights of stairs. and stay confined to bed until john got home (he gave in and paid $30 to take a car service) to get my crutches out of the storage locker that we just put away a few weeks ago (against my better judgement).<br />So although i netted myself 3 days in a row off from work it was 3 very uncomfortable bed ridded days. <br />Now, it&#039;s the MTAs fault i had to be there that late in the day, but i&#039;ll give them act of some sort of god for the rain, BUT aren&#039;t they responsible for keeping the area around the stairs in good repair, as in not torn up so bad people hurt themselves? <br /><br />In other news, I&#039;m back at work (booooo) but down to one crutch (yay!)

				i did, but the BF has an aversion to buses since he used to take far too many when living in maspeth/middle village.

We, or I at least, probably would have taken the bus or walked to either station, but the next step became-how far are we actually goin to get. we had heard the 4, 5 and 6 were out in manhattan so he couldn&#039;t get to where he needed (86th and east end ave) and were unsure if i could make it to the 23rd/broadway stop. and even the station attendant guy, who was out on the street was telling us &quot;you could try, but i make no guarantees. they haven&#039;t been keeping us up to speed&quot;<br />at least i sprained my ankle at the top of my own street (i&#039;m on the 34th ave end of 46th street, mercifully)imagine if my ankle rolled while i was in manhattan, by myself!

				I was in a similar situation this morning on the N. By the time I got to 59th St. I decided to catch the 4/5 express down to Wall St. since I figured that it would be a while before I could catch a W or R, but it was also very slow. It took me an hour and a half or so to get to work and it normally takes me 45 minutes to an hour. :(<br /><br />It&#039;s frustrating to sit there and not move, but I&#039;m with you - bitching while in the situation accomplishes nothing. I think, though, that the bitching/wondering what&#039;s going on might be reduced a bit if they could at least give us approximations of when we can get moving. Like &quot;we will be sitting here for another 10 minutes&quot; instead of &quot;we apologize for the inconvenience and will be moving shortly&quot;. &quot;Shortly&quot; is so relative. At least we, as passengers, could be more educated on how we could or should proceed.

				I think that when they deign to actually give a &quot;reason&quot; for the delay, they pick one that sounds feasible for how long they expect the delay to be. And sometimes maybe they forget the previous one they said... <br /><br />Agreed the loud exasperation and complaining doesn&#039;t help, but as with the flooding earlier this year it&#039;s the lack of communication/info that makes it 100x worse. If they had clear obvious info, and actually made it visible/audible at stations -- for example before you walk up through the turnstiles and on to the platform with 3000 people waiting -- much, much griping and complaining would be averted (publicly at least) and people could make other plans/trains/buses. <br /><br />Our train system is stuck in the dark ages, and it&#039;s rather depressing that I can&#039;t see any feasible way of significant upgrades happening anytime in the [semi-near] future. Esp as they&#039;re projected to be back into big deficits within a year or so...

				I don&#039;t think I would have minded as much if they were just running efficiently up to Astoria Boulevard and then going express back, but we waited at least 10-15 minutes in each station with no information except there was congestion ahead.&nbsp; Why not just get the trains moving?&nbsp; Wouldn&#039;t that alleviate the congestion?&nbsp; (and let people get to work?!)

The ride to work wasn&#039;t any better. There&#039;s a reason why the N/W have been rated the worst in the system 4 years in a row.

				They are too slow in turning around the trains departing from Ditmars in the evenings.&nbsp; The past few weeks have been bad (must be all those additional W trains - thanks, MTA!), but last night in particular seemed to take even longer than usual.&nbsp; From around 6pm to 6:40 we sat between stations for long stretches of time from Queensborough to Ditmars, so much so that one guy on my train had a hissy fit!&nbsp; :-o He threw a water bottle, and was alternately cussing loudly AND mumbling to himself.&nbsp; C R A Z Y.&nbsp; Thankfully the car was fairly empty, so no one had to run for cover.&nbsp;

				Because all the Manhattan-bound trains are busy having their doors held open? A similar scenario plays out with buses, at least in Manhattan. Then you eventually get ALL of the buses at once... I&#039;m sure the impending service cuts (and rate hikes) will make everything better!

				Yeah, last night I went to a bar to bid a transferred co-worker farewell.&nbsp; I began heading home at 7.&nbsp; I knew something was up because a W train pulled up to 57th Street on a different track and went out of service, so the people packed on that train spilled out.&nbsp; When an N pulled up, it was packed already.&nbsp; Very uncomfortable.&nbsp; Then we waited 10 minutes outside of Queensboro.&nbsp; When we got there, we were told the N was going out of service.<br /><br />I walked the entire way to Astoria Boulevard.&nbsp; My knee popped out near Broadway and I was forced to limp the rest of the way.&nbsp; I got home at 8:30.&nbsp; An hour and a half journey.<br /><br />THE MTA SUCKS!&nbsp; I can&#039;t believe they had the balls to strike in &#039;05.

				I ran into the same issue coming home around 6:30 last night.&nbsp; Fortunately, my partner ran into the same problem a few months ago and remembered that the Q69 actually originates at 28th Street and Queens Plaza South (across from the Fusion LIC Complex). Then it winds through LIC for a few minutes before it hits 21st Street.&nbsp; All told the ride to Ditmars and 31st was about a half hour.&nbsp; <br /><br />For what it&#039;s worth I was on one of the buses that passed the people standing on 21st Street and we were yelling at the driver to stop and let people on and we would make room.&nbsp; The driver was about as smart as an ear of corn as he wasn&#039;t even announcing stops so I started doing it myself since so many people were confused about where we were going.&nbsp; <br /><br />Kind of makes me thankful now for all those drunken cab rides from Manhattan along 21st Street over the years!

				So obviously a switch problem at Ditmars would cause them to suspend service, as the trains can&#039;t turn around and thus stack up. My question is, the Manhattan-bound service was still running, wasn&#039;t it? Was that just residual trains?<br /><br />And if they&#039;re just moving trains out of QB Plaza to sit further down the line, if there&#039;s room, couldn&#039;t they say &quot;Hey, we&#039;ll take this train to Astoria Blvd and it&#039;ll go out of service&quot;, then the next &quot;Hey, we&#039;ll take this train to 30th Ave and it&#039;ll go out of service&quot;, etc.

				The trains were NOT okay by 8:30 this morning. I got to the crowded Broadway platform at 8:35 and for twenty minutes only two trains came by, both terribly crowded. Only a few people could get on each. I forced my way onto the third train, which was the most crowded train I&#039;ve ever been on in five years of living here. We sat between each station with no announcements, nothing. I was 25 minutes late for work and nearly missed a meeting. <br /><br />If they weren&#039;t passing out free cookies at work today, I would be in a very bad mood. <br /><br />I understand that signal problems happen, customers get sick, etc., but for the train crew to make NO ANNOUNCEMENT on the train for more than half an hour is ridiculous. The conductor wasn&#039;t even announcing station stops.

				The new MTA game after about 9/9:30 in the AM is to send all the trains up to Astoria Boulevard and make you wait there to take an express into Astoria (adding about 30-40 minutes to the morning commute).&nbsp; I get that they have to do track work, but I still think something is seriously wrong at the Ditmars station as trains back up regularly.&nbsp; We should not see six trains go North with no trains coming back.&nbsp; Once they have filled both slots at Ditmars and all three slots at Astoria Boulevard, they should know something is very wrong.&nbsp; The skipped Astoria Boulevard this morning from Ditmars they were so backed up.&nbsp; When I was on the Broadway platform, there was a train at 30th, a train about to pull into Broadway and one at 36th Avenue, and we&#039;d already seen another go North.&nbsp; They are seriously messed up.

				Yeah. The first guy I saw doing it had a threatening look on his face, like &quot;Yeah, what are you gonna do about it?&quot; The second guy, which was last week, seemed simply crazy. I first noticed him when he spontaneously got up at Astoria Blvd and walked all the way down to the other side of the car to stand up and stair out the window (the car was nearly empty). A couple minutes later, he walked all the way back to the side I was on and sat on the last bench, where he proceeded to chain smoke and open the between-car doors to throw out the butts.

				Speaking of the morning rush hour, is it me or have the trains been less crowded recently?&nbsp; &nbsp;I know the MTA just released some stats this week saying that ridership has dipped due to the recession/depression but there is usually a lag between the time statistics are released and the time they actually reflect.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I get on at 30th Avenue around the same time as you do and the last couple of mornings you could actually get seats on the trains I got on.<br /><br />And last night, well after rush hour, there was no one on the W train I got on at Times Square around 9:30.&nbsp; &nbsp;Usually seats are gone after TS, unless you get on in one of the last cars.

				Now that I live off the R line, I notice that there aren&#039;t nearly enough complaints about it in this thread. It sucks during rush hour. Really, really slow. Usually it&#039;s not <em>that</em> crowded, at least compared to how the N/W get during rush hour, but the slowness is pretty bad.

				No comments about the horror show on the N this weekend?&nbsp; &nbsp;Thankfully, I live close enough to the Astoria Boulevard station to walk there.&nbsp; &nbsp;Not only were the trains messed up between Queesboro Plaza &amp; Manhattan, but no inbound service after Astoria Blvd.&nbsp; It is going to be that way for the next month or so.&nbsp; &nbsp;Getting into Manhattan on the weekends is going to be fun, fun, fun.

				Yes, it was just awful getting around this weekend.&nbsp; Some sort of construction going on for the next month, I hear for the next four weekends?&nbsp; Seems like every weekend all the trains in and around the city are going through service changes.&nbsp; It&#039;s hard to keep up with it all!&nbsp; Makes traveling very exhausting....

				Ive found the best way to get into manhattan when the trains are screwy is the M60 bus. Pick it up anywhere on AStoria Blvd. and youll be at 125th / Lex to catch the 4-5-6 in under 10 minutes. The bus runs pretty well on time, and if one bus is too crowded (like it was this weekend) they do send extra buses. The ride is fast, quick, and generally not crowded at all.&nbsp; I swear by it - was to work and home a far shade quicker than going all the way to grand central and then up again!

				I may be a minority of one, but I think thee has been a notable decrease in ridership on weekday mornings.&nbsp; I switch at Queensboro Plaza for the 7 and the last two days the 7 trains have been empty.&nbsp; It could be a fluke or it could be the effects of the recession.

				The train this morning was so bad that, while I was still riding the train and being very late for work, I started thinking of lyrics to a new song called &quot;N Train Blues.&quot; The only lines I&#039;ve thought of are &quot;I&#039;ve got the N train blues,&quot; along with something about how yesterday I read a review about the Ditmars Starbucks having problems with roaches in the ice cubes, and then how when I got off at my stop at 49th Street there was a pile of poop (possibly human) in the corner of the stairwell. &quot;blues,&quot; &quot;cubes,&quot; and &quot;poop&quot; all rhyme, so, as you can see, this song has great potential.
