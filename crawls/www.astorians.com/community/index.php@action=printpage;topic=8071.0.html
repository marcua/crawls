				Some of you may already know this, but I was walking by 30th Ave - 30th Street and noticed that Baru is now 7-Eleven. It hasnt officially opened yet but the sign is up and they are hiring.&nbsp; Wow its taken so many years for 7-Eleven to come to New York City and now in the past 3 years, we have 3.

				er, there&#039;s been lots of 7/11s in queens awhile now... way more than 3 years. Used to go to one on union tpke in the early 90s... <br /><br />but damn nice that there&#039;ll be one here now. Sure will be driving over to astoria blvd and 80whatever to get a slurpee...<br /><br />(used to go to the imitation 7/11, &#039;fastbreak&#039; on Bway for such stuff... was feeling ripped off they opened a fastbreak on ditmars and it has no slurpees...)

				I stand corrected, I didnt realize there were 7-11&#039;s in Queens!&nbsp; Im originally from the Bronx (the last 4 years here in Astoria) so the closest 7-11 was in Yonkers.

				All those 7-11s here! I didnt realize that....and here I am thinking im a seasoned NY-er. LOL...As you can tell, Im so out of the loop&nbsp; :-D .&nbsp; But its cool that if im craving a Slurpee, I can just walk a few blocks and get one! <br /><br />Im usually on the up and up when it comes to certain chains. I was very happy when Jamba Juice came here, and Qdoba, Pinkberry, Ruby Tuesdays (soon opening up in Times Square) etc...all the places you dont usually see here in the city. <br /><br /><br />Speaking of chains, it would be nice if there wasa Bertucci&#039;s here in Astoria. Its a chain pizza/italian restaurant and I went there two weeks ago and boy is their Pizza good (for a chain pizza restaurant).&nbsp; I know for sure Bertuccis is only on Long Island and New Jersey.&nbsp;

				waa waa waa 7-11 is evil, corporate franchise chains suck-- whatever.....<br /><br />you can keep the overpriced half air/foam &quot;frappes&quot; made with instant nescafe...blecch<br />and<br />I can look forward to preparing my own coffee @ the self serve 7-11 counter to my own exacting proportions using whatever different flavored creamers my own way without having to go to dunkin donuts------ <br /><br />where without fail I give my order as clearly and slowly as humanly possible and I still get asked 15 seconds later, did you want milk with that? and then 15 seconds later did you want the coffee iced or hot? and then of course asking you if you want a bagel or donut when you already specified what &quot;pastry&quot; you wanted first thing when they called out next, and god forbid they are training someone new on the job during the busiest morning hour..... you all know what i&#039;m talking about.&nbsp; :wink:<br /><br /><br />So i for one welcome our evil 7-11 overlords. Let them have their own store to coexist amongst the frappe joints, dunkin donuts, starbucks and&nbsp; mom and pop delis. We just need a Krispy Kreme maybe to ensure all voices are present in the choir to caffeinate and sugarfy ourselves conveniently.&nbsp;

				Oh! The sheer agony of repeating &quot;light, no sugar&quot; 3 times. Which word are you having a problem with? Then getting back into the car, traveling (oh) perhaps 6–9 miles to pick up a friend, opening this caffeine treat, sipping just a small mouthful of the seductive hot liquid . . . and spitting it out the window! I SAID, &quot;light NO sugar.&quot; <br /><br />I too look forward to making it the way I like/want it. No more wasted money. <br /><br />Coffee my way, and Slurpees. <br /><br />That&#039;s reason enough for me to be happy to have my very own (http://www.7-eleven.com/images/tmpl_r03_c04.gif)

				I&#039;d love it if my corner store got a slurpee machine, but it ain&#039;t happening. so 7/11 here i come.

				If 7-11 has self-service coffee, that at least is a point that the mom-and-pop delis would do well to heed.&nbsp; I work in Harlem, where the mom-and-pop delis differ as to how they provide hot coffee.&nbsp; One deli, in particular, often put sugar in my coffee, and I hate that, so I&#039;d go right back to them and ask for another cup.&nbsp; Then they went self-service.&nbsp; Probably had been mixing up a lot of other orders.<br /><br />One thing 7-11 has against it: it&#039;s right across the street from a 24-hour supermarket so it has stiff competition for the late-night market.<br /><br />But even now, I miss the everything pizza from the Rainbow Cafe!&nbsp; I don&#039;t miss having to consume it while the rumble from the stereo shakes up my insides.

				i highly doubt the trade fair across the street will pose competition.&nbsp; if i can run into a 7-11, grab my snacks/beer/quart of milk/whathaveyou, wait in line, and pay all within 5 minutes, trade fair is NO match.&nbsp; that place is a death wish.&nbsp; i go 5 blocks out of my way and go up to key food just to avoid the madness.&nbsp;

				PJ I agree with you that the new owners of that deli on 31st &amp; 21st St. are a ripoff.&nbsp; I once went to buy a small bottle of water and it cost more than all the other stores, so from now on I don&#039;t go there for anything.&nbsp; I also don&#039;t see what the big deal is with a 7-11 opening in Astoria.

				I live around the corner from this place, watched it slowly move in. at first I didn&#039;t believe it -- I was surprised that what appeared to be a cafe was overtaken by a convenience store. I don&#039;t understand the appeal of them either; in fact I hadn&#039;t been inside a 7/11 for probably a decade until this summer while I was in copenhagen. 7/11 is nearly as pervasive there as starbucks is here.

				Slurpees are fantastic...get yourself one, braun.&nbsp; They are similar to snow-cones but more like a drink (more sugary, I guess).&nbsp; They have like 8 flavors at the 30th Ave 7-11 and I recommend mixing and matching them together. :)

				Gave it a shot on my way home tonight, since I needed some half&amp;half. A small gang of kids hung out in the doorway, and the little kid blocking the way asked me if I had a quarter&nbsp; :x uhh, <em>nooo.</em>&nbsp; He mumbled something about &quot;f__ing b!tch&quot; and I felt my blood pressure skyrocket immediately. I considered putting the little punk through the wall if he said something else on my way out.<br /><br />The selection was disappointing and I decided it could wait. Punka$$ was again blocking the way, snickering with his friends. I hoped the door slammed on him.<br /><br />It&#039;s odd how a clean, shiny, new chain store can be a magnet for the wrong element.
