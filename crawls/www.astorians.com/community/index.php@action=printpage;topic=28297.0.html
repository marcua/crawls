				I find it so amusing that Brooklynites and Astorians alike are willing to pay a huge premium for &quot;comfort food&quot; at their local hip eatery.Comfort tends to be the catch phrase for food that the poorer classes eat at an exaggerated price.<br />My particular restaurant scam is is Southern dish of Biscuits and Sausage gravy that is so popular down in Williamsburg and seemingly now here in Astoria.<br />As a an ethnic Hillbilly on my mother&#039;s side (believe it or not, I&#039;m a WV Hatfield), I&#039;ve been eating this dish since I could dunk a biscuit into gravy and preparing it since I could turn on a stove.<br />This mystical dish, the storied breakfast meal of Hipsters and Yuppies alike is an extremely easy and very inexpensive dish to prepare. It&#039;s Hillbilly soul food. My grandmother could feed an army for the price of a B&amp;SG entree either here in Astoria or Brooklyn.<br />Borough Nosh features the dish for about $6.00 but let&#039;s take a look at the price of the ingredients before I share the recipe with you.<br /><br /><br />Ingredients:<br />!lb pork sausage 3.99 at any supermarket<br />2 cups (1 pint) of milk $1.00 at Deals<br />A few table spoons of Flour to thicken negligible<br />Salt and pepper negligible<br /><br /><br />Total price of gravy is about $6.00<br />Divided into six portions: Total cost $1.00 per portion.<br /><br /><br />Now, let&#039;s be generous with the price of biscuits.<br />4 for a dollar seems to be about right.<br /><br /><br />The total price of a portion of this extremely exotic comfort food is $1.25. You might say that the mark up (no pun intended that you are an easy mark) is alright because it is such a difficult dish to make. It&#039;s not worth my time.<br /><br /><br />See Ingredients above:<br /><ul class="bbc_list" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li><span style="font-family: Verdana;" class="bbc_font">[size=78%]Cook the sausage and render the fat (discard if you are politically correct).

I am the same way. Just last weekend a friend and I ventured up to a great West African (Ghanan) place up in the Bronx and had a wonderful meal. Such large portions for so little money. The food was amazing! The roast beef fell apart on the fork and the heat level was deceptive as it slow built to a crescendo. The Rice and beans were unlike any others that I&#039;ve ever had being spiced so differently than my usual cuban version. Will I return? Definitely. Two Ginger Beers, Two entrees (enough for four people) and a fried cheese appetizer for each of us. $ 19.00 including tip. Could I make these amazing stew myself? Perhaps with time and a bit of practice.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=28297.msg239967.html#msg239967">Quote from: StephanieL on August 04, 2014, 12:46:07 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> Novice cooks could easily broil a steak or a hamburger, assemble spaghetti marinara, make an omelet or French toast, etc.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>&nbsp; <br />I don&#039;t think that this completely honest or true. Spaghetti Marinara? I suppose that you are assuming boxed pasta and bottled sauce. Not really the same as the product. Same with a burger or steak. The average New Yorker only really has two choices both inferior to a restaurant--pan frying or broiling. definitely not the same experience as grilling over coals or an open flame. I&#039;m a pretty good cook but I&#039;ll admit that my burgers are vastly inferior to Bare Burgers. I also make pretty good versions of Thai and Chinese dishes. But have to admit that they are lacking because given my restrictions, I can&#039;t really get the temperature of my wok to the flaming point that is needed to impart that special high temperature taste. I think that my neighbors would frown on setting my apartment on fire to make a perfect Pad See Ew. On the other hand the recipe I supplied is quick and easy and accesible to anyone with a skillet (preferably) or a frying pan--no special equipment needed.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=28297.msg239967.html#msg239967">Quote from: StephanieL on August 04, 2014, 12:46:07 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Whether one actually has the skills or the desire/time to cook is another thing.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I agree that mixing three ingredients in a frying pan and spending fifteen minutes in front a stove is a major human rights violation if you don&#039;t have a domestic to it for you. If you can make scrambled eggs, you can do this. Of course now here&#039;s where it gets interesting. You can&#039;t brag about frequenting a trendy restaurant when you do it yourself in your apartment for you and your SO.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=28297.msg239967.html#msg239967">Quote from: StephanieL on August 04, 2014, 12:46:07 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Also, your example is interesting: one person&#039;s daily ordinary food is another person&#039;s exotica.&nbsp; I grew up kosher in central NJ and my partner grew up in Africa.&nbsp; Neither of us ate biscuits and gravy growing up nor did we experience it in our local restaurants. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> <br />Wow! I would hope that as a child raised in a kosher household that you didn&#039;t eat a lot of Biscuits and sausage gravy.I can&#039;t imagine a dish that is more treif!

Maybe &quot;kitchen memory is an antiquated term for &quot;googling a recipe?<br />By the way my mother was an Appalachian from the mines and &quot;hollars&quot; of West Virginia but my father was Switzerduits (Swiss German) from Northern Ohio and the descendant of Ministers. My Korean friends think I&#039;m crazy to make Kim Chi and Kim Bap, whenever I roast a chicken Matza Ball soup is sure to follow, A quick pernil with moros y maduros, and, of course, Banh Mi at every chance i get.<br />Who needs a restaurant to eat well? You just need an internet connection, a couple of pots and pans a few moments away from the rat race, <br /><br /><br />OTOH, if you have more cash than sense. Buy peasant food for a premium and prove to your friends that you so much cooler than they are. Filet and Surf and Turf is SOOOO last century 1 per center. The new elite approves of gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches and Mac and Cheese to show that they&#039;re still &quot;keeping it real&quot;.<br /><br /><br />-={ Astoristani }=-

				Yes, it costs more to have in a restaurant than it does to make it at home. After 4 or 5 nights a week of shopping, cooking, and cleaning up for dinner after working all day, it&#039;s nice to take a break and have someone else take care of you. And there&#039;s always a cheaper option somewhere, so I say stop worrying about it and find a place you like. Sometimes its about valuing how you spend your time.

				Honestly, I would say the rise in upscale &quot;comfort food&quot; restaurants stems not from demographics, but rather from a greater societal emphasis on healthy eating. Healthy eating shopping and recipes are so ubiquitous that people who are cooking for themselves and seeing what actually goes into a dish they are less likely to amp up the oil, cream, butter, lard, etc.&nbsp; I would say this is particularly true of NYC in the past 10 years or so with Bloomberg&#039;s personal crusade against fat and sugar. When you go out, however, you want to have something you wouldn&#039;t make for yourself that is nostalgic and comforting. You can also turn a blind eye to the mountains of cheese and butter that go into it. Hence the success of such restaurants. It&#039;s not about the &quot;hipsters&quot; or the &quot;1%&quot;, it&#039;s a shift in our culture&#039;s relationship to food.

				And it&#039;s hardly the &quot;1%&quot; alone who rarely cook.&nbsp; Part of the surge in obesity (and the related diabetes, heart disease, etc.) among the poor and working-class comes from the fact that many people have to work 2 or more low-wage, shift jobs to make ends meet, and they either have no free time or are so exhausted that it&#039;s easier to get food from a local takeout place.

				I find it so amusing that you are persecuting people for the convenience of going to a restaurant for this meal... and then you suggest the granddaddy of convenience for your very recipe, crappy biscuits from a can.&nbsp; Homemade biscuit recipes abound on the internet, are hardly complicated/time-consuming, and only require a handful of ingredients most people who cook their own meals regularly would have on hand.&nbsp; What happened, you didn&#039;t have the time/energy/desire to do it from scratch?&nbsp; So your idea of convenience is acceptable (subpar quality) but someone else&#039;s is not (paying more at a restaurant), instead of the more logical approach that different people have different priorities?&nbsp; Got it.<br /><br />And before you decide you have me all figured out, I am not a &#039;transplant&#039; and have lived in Astoria my whole life.&nbsp; Never been rich.&nbsp; Cook the vast majority of my meals myself but I&#039;m not swimming in money saved as fresh good quality ingredients are not cheap.&nbsp; So instead of spending my money on going out to eat regularly, I&#039;m spending it on better ingredients AND the time to prepare them.&nbsp; I do this because I enjoy cooking, that is my choice and my luxury alone and not one I expect everyone else to share.<br /><br />Also amusing was the fact that you think everyone should listen to you on how they must spend their own money that they work for.&nbsp; Own a tv?&nbsp; A smartphone?&nbsp; Game console?&nbsp; Name brand clothes/groceries/toilet paper/whatever?&nbsp; Computer?&nbsp; I guarantee there are things in your home that other people would consider frivolous and unnecessary and could easily offer up cheaper, less convenient/desired (to you) alternatives - you may not have asked for their opinion but hey, no one here did either.&nbsp; So if someone&#039;s idea of luxury is $6 biscuits and gravy because they didn&#039;t have to cook it, clean up after it, and got to hang out with some friends while eating it, how is this stopping you from eating the way you want to eat?
