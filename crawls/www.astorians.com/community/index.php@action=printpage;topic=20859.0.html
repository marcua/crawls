				Hi, can anyone recommend a bonded professional A/C installer (or handy person) who can de-install and then re-install a 12,000 BTU A/C unit that is bracketed to the outside of the window.&nbsp; We&#039;re moving apartments (just across the hall) and we think we may have someone lined up, but it might not work out, so I&#039;m looking for back-up person.<br /><br />Thanks!

				I just wanted to post that we had John doing the de/re-installation of the A/C along with the changing of our deadlock cylinder.&nbsp; He&#039;s AWESOME!&nbsp; He and another guy (his assistant?) did the work in about an hour and a half and my husband says they&#039;re really friendly, nice guys.&nbsp; Also, he&#039;s fees very quite reasonable. <br /><br />John&#039;s a locksmith who has a storefront on 36th St. and 30th Ave.&nbsp; He used to be over on Broadway near the shoe repair place near 33rd ST.&nbsp; In fact, he&#039;s the locksmith I used when I originally moved into this building several years ago. Anyway, amongst other reasons, I love Astorians because of finds (rediscovery in this case) like John.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;:-)

				I know this comes too late, but for the future Ace Air Conditioning is very good.&nbsp; They did a nice job with reinstalling my ACs a few years ago.

				Just to follow-up here, we had John come over and install two AC Units for us yesterday. I am sure there must be other people looking to get units installed given the recent temperature increases and just wanted to confirm the comments made by Mer are entirely accurate. He came same day, was done in under an hour, extremely pleasant and fees were reasonable.<br /><br /><br />Thanks John (and Astorians!)

				We also had John (718-539-2393) replace a rather large AC this week.&nbsp; He did a professional job for a reasonable price.
