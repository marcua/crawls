				Hi, I was just wondering if anyone has lived in the Victoria Hall Condominium building (30-44 29th Street) and can share their experience?&nbsp; I am thinking of purchasing a condo there and was interested in how well the building is maintained, how helpful the super is with maintenance issues, how the neighbors are, how packages are received, general quality of life, etc.<br /><br /><br />Any information would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Thank you!

				I am writing from an ignorant standpoint as I know nothing of this building, I can tell you almost all of the new construction in Astoria has been horrendous. Super bad quality. I have a couple of friends who bought in new buildings that we riddled with issues. One even had to sue the developer. I would buy prewar if I was in the market.
