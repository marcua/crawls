				I live in the same neighborhood as the scam artist Councilman Peter Vallone, who cannot be bothered to have his staff answer email inquiries (try finding a contact that actually works on his website), answer phone calls or take action against the litter and noise pollution problem that plagues his own neighborhood. Aparently he enjoys living in filth and amongst menacing thugs who blare their car stereos on shore blvd at 3am and attempt to intimidate neighborhood residents during the day.<br /><br />Try calling 311? No answer No internal affairs? No response. Go down to the river at night to see who is doing it? Youll see the cops trying to pick up girls, because they know they are in with Vallone and xcan be as inactive and lazy as they wish to be.<br /><br />I hope Vallone reads this, gets off his fat lazy ass and does soemthing this, because clearly, he cares more about putting our tax dollars in his pocket than doing his god damned job.<br /><br />What a piece of crap he is.

				I&#039;ve had the opposite experience - they&#039;ve always been very responsive when I&#039;ve called or written, even in areas that were technically outside the jurisdiction of the City Council.&nbsp; His staff was responsible for the repairs to the stairs on the East side entrance to the Broadway N/W station, got us trash cans at key locations on Broadway and helped us shut down two noisy nightclubs.&nbsp; He&#039;s even painted over graffiti in many parts of the neighborhood.&nbsp; <br /><br />Are you calling during normal work hours?&nbsp; I know his council email is on the NYC Council website - I think they all are.

				Well, if you live in the neighborhood, you will in no way deny the fact that nothing is being done. The smell of sewage last night was unbearable....the deafening sounds from the smokestacks behind steinway piano factory still continue. I am moving Sunday, but I hope that Hellgate19 takes up the fight for me. He seems to have the rage that is necessary for change. Politicians are worst breed of people. Hellgate19, I now pronounce you &quot;Savior of Astoria&quot;. Good luck and godspeed.

I think your paraphrasing is a bit off on this matter. The things you complained about are definitely a valid concern, and things that at one time or another have been issues that have affected most people on this board. What I read in Vallone&#039;s response, however, is that he has little control over your particular grievances. In fact, if I recall correctly, he is pretty accurate in his description in that he opposed the power plant. All of the issues you raised in the initial letter (LaGuardia, Riker&#039;s, Power Plant, etc.) are <span class="bbc_u">state controlled</span>, which means local assembly has little influence in the matters.<br />If I am correctly interpreting the one sentence of Vallone&#039;s response letter that you seem to be focusing on, he is telling you that if you think our neighborhood is such a ghetto dump, then leave. Frankly, I agree with him. You have done nothing on this board except complain about and bash Astoria- yet you still remain here. Yes, Astoria has it&#039;s problems, but in relation to the rest of this city, it is a nice place to live; and if you&#039;re going to consistently talk crap about the neighborhood then you should get out and find some place that is more to your liking. <br /><br />I have written letters to Vallone&#039;s office before and received prompt responses- particularly on the matter of why the 114th precinct seems to NEVER answer their phone. It also seems that your letter to Vallone got a prompt and rather open response. <br /><br />While I am not the biggest Vallone supporter, I don&#039;t think he should be held responsible for things that are not even in his realm of influence, and I do think he has done some good things for this community.

				I am outraged by his arrogant response to you. I would never leave my name knowing what he is capable of, given his cozy relationship with the precinct. I in fact witnessed him scream at a guy who flipped a passing car the bird because the passing car called the guy in question a f*ggot. Vallone threatened someone defending their integrity with hauling them to jail!!! <br /><br />Anyone that would allow their own neighborhood to become a dumping ground for trash as shore blvd and astoria park have become should be removed from power. How the hell are empty oil barrels with no tops along the river going to contain garbage when you have strong river winds whipping the refuse up into the air, all over the park, and worse yet, into the river? It;s not rocket science, but apparently Vallone, it is. If he had not noticed the problem by virtue of being a resident, then that is overwhelming evidence he is not truly involved in his community and does not know about the problems in his own backyard. (though I must say it is lovely having the astoria park area cleared of snow first, as he lives here. Just one of the many countless perks he enjoys at the taxpayers expense)<br /><br />What kind of traitor allows littering to go unchecked in his backyard? Sure, they&#039;ll ticket my 70 year old neighbor for not having a leash on&nbsp; his senior golden retriever off, but they won&#039;t ticket whole people who decide to set up grills, have birthday parties, and then leave their crap behind as they go back to their own neighborhoods. They won&#039;t ticket hoodlums leaving their fast food containers behind...right where over 1,000 people lost their lives. It is the site of General Slocum ferry disaster. Would we allow people to leave their fried chicken bones at ground zero? F THAT. This is an outrage. This is an insult to our history. It is an insult to the environment. This is an insult to my checking account. I pay taxes and I DEMAND better of our &quot;leadership&quot;.<br /><br />He has the power to actively and IMMEDIATELY change the situation, yet he ignores the tax paying citizens to the point that we have to harrangue him online. <br /><br />If you are reading this Vallone, your days of abusing your neighbors is finished. You are far too content to live amongst filth. You are allowing our history to be raped and raized to the ground. You&#039;ve encouraged unbridled construction for profit knowing full well we do not have the infrastructure to support it. <br /><br />You&#039;ve done nothing but enjoy political celebrity, branding as one person pointed out, your name on anything that is pinned down or hired to clean trash in front of morning commuters in a crass bid to make us think you actually give a good god damn.<br /><br />If you really want to fix Astoria, you&#039;d use every ounce of influence you have with the precinct to actively and agressively ticket people for littering, for blaring car horns and car stereos Be a pain in the ass in the pursuit of saving our old historic buildings (does anyone realize that the Metropolitan Museum of Art&#039;s new American Wing has an entire 19th century parlor removed from a no longer standing farmhouse in Astoria?) An intelligent, soulful person would do that, but as you have zero respect for history, nature or those you obviously look down upon, (your neighbors) we&#039;ll need to continue hammering at you and forwarding these postings to every metro area media outlet until you DO YOUR JOB.<br /><br />PS -If Vallone has endorsed you as a political candidate (specifically speaking of that greek girl riding his coat tails) I am SO not voting for you. Not until Vallone gets off the can and gets it in gear. <br /><br />

				Further to QueensCrapper&#039;s point, the internet, and our ability to broadcast the truth, IS getting off our asses and doing something about the problem. Whether you like him or not is irrelevant, President Obama did not get elected by just shaking people&#039;s hands and reading pretty poetry on camera. He changed the course of history by utilizing the internet as a impactful instrument of change.<br /><br />I would much rather be riding my bike in a clean park, but instead, I am sacrificing my personal time loggin online to help get people to join in cyber screaming at the top of our lungs, that Vallone if failing his neighbors. Never mind is &quot;constituents&quot;. This is a personal insult from our neighbor, the one who is supposed to be helping us, the very one who lives a few blocks away, is not being a fighter for preserving what makes this neighborhood the single best nabe in new york f*ing city, PERIOD. I&#039;ve been here 13 years and I&#039;ll stripped naked in church and covered in doo doo before I allow a man like Vallone to obliterate his home which is MY home. I am far more proud to be an Astoria than his entire family combined, and I&#039;m not even a native.<br /><br />Nothing changes if you keep your mouth shut.<br /><br />VALLONE OUT NOW

				Impeaching is out of question, I have my likes and dislikes of him, but lets not get carried away.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I never met him, but dealt with his office. They are effecient, but I had to push for result on problem, and lady who seems to run things, I think she is from Ireland,&nbsp; was all business, which is fine.&nbsp; &nbsp;Problem involed reletive and cop, and they were pro-cop.&nbsp; &nbsp; A cop had threatened kid in family, took a while to resolve,&nbsp; although maybe it was not resolved.&nbsp; Cop was not punished, and on folllow up&nbsp; &nbsp;woman from his office had attitude.&nbsp; Kid never encountered cop again, so who nows.&nbsp; <br /><br />On plus side he is from neighborhood, knows area, is around a lot, stays active in community.&nbsp; &nbsp;He is a politition, so we can do much worse.&nbsp; Can we do better?&nbsp; I don&#039;t see it.&nbsp; &nbsp; I think he tries, and it is a balancing act that is especially tough in such a largly populated area with so many different interest groups.&nbsp; &nbsp;

My impression is that if someone thinks a place is so terrible and consistently badmouths it, then why the hell should that person stay? If I thought a place was a &quot;ghetto dump&quot; I wouldn&#039;t live there and constantly talk crap about it, I&#039;d think the smart thing to do was move somewhere else that I actually liked. <br /><br />As far as complaining about your politicians, <strong>I am all for it</strong>. Write letters to him or her. Campaign for or against him or her. What I am taking issue with on this thread is that a lot of people are complaining about things that are not within his realm of control. I don&#039;t blame Bush or Obama for the weather. Whether I agree or disagree with his politics, I am fairly certain that Vallone is not trying to &quot;destroy his home&quot;. Just like anyone else, I&#039;m sure he wants him and his family to live in a nice place. <br /><br />I fully support voicing out your opinions to your politicians. Constantly badmouthing Astoria, however, is not anything productive, and yes it irritates me when someone calls my home &quot;a dump&quot;. As far as Vallone goes, write him letters, call his office, do whatever- but don&#039;t waste his time calling and just telling him that you think Astoria is a sh*thole, because it ties up the line for people with issues that he can do something about.

The mere fact that the main telephone of the 114 Pct is not answered promptly has never been addressed; that the Community Officer has never been responsive to the Community&#039;s needs; that the late night club noise issues have never been fully addressed and that the Pct Command sets their own goals without allowing any regular folk at their meetings to have any input into what OUR needs actually are. We don&#039;t need a funeral for the W where our Councilperson gets to shake hands and kiss babies and smile for the media he invited, we need a Councilperson who is there for his constituents and not treating OUR neighborhood as his personal domain.

				That&#039;s where I think you&#039;re wrong, guys.&nbsp; For example, calling 311 only gets you so far.&nbsp; You called 311 and it&#039;s still a problem.&nbsp; So now you call the local CM.&nbsp; What backup material is required other than a description of the problem and maybe the 311 confirmation number?&nbsp; It&#039;s the CM&#039;s job to resolve whatever problems are happening in his district and he needs public input to do that.&nbsp; If people aren&#039;t getting satisfaction, that&#039;s an internal office problem.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s funny how it&#039;s a challenge to get the CM motivated to get simple things done, like have graffiti or garbage cleaned up, yet real &quot;friends&quot; of the council member easily get ice cream money for their not-for-profits and are selected for huge contracts without a problem.&nbsp; And this doesn&#039;t just apply to Vallone.&nbsp; It&#039;s pretty much across the board.

				City agencies, state agencies and federal agencies almost always want a letter from the original complainant, pictures if it&#039;s something that needs to be repaired or some proof of a violation occurring.&nbsp; It&#039;s easy to just say they should be able to make things get fixed, but you generally have to have some sort of proof else the agencies don&#039;t do anything - I&#039;m not sure if they could legally by their internal regulations and the Charter of the City of New York, let alone the laws and regulations at the state and federal level.&nbsp; I&#039;ve always found you get the best results when you research what the law is, document the violation or problem and suggest a possible solution.&nbsp; You don&#039;t always get what you ask for, but you usually get them moving at least along the lines you suggest - sometimes you get more or less what you&#039;re seeking - it varies a lot by situation.

				I certainly didn&#039;t call my local City Council person and say I was the Queens Crapper. I instructed someone else to call to get their dumping problem resolved and it was taken care of within 24 hours.&nbsp; The key with most of the council members is to know who in the office is actually responsible for taking care of things.&nbsp; Just leaving a message with whoever answers the phone is not going to cut it because most of them are not the sharpest knives in the drawer nor do they care about people&#039;s problems.&nbsp; They are patronage positions.&nbsp; You worked on their campaign, you get a paid job after they get elected.

You&#039;re an activist and have the experience dealing with the bureaucracy, and this I believe goes back to Dirk&#039;s point in that a person making a complaint has some degree of responsibility to facilitate it&#039;s resolution. whether that be getting it on the record by putting it in writing or getting to know the elected official and the people working for them.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Unfortunately, I think you&#039;re right.&nbsp; <br /><br />I wish folks would engage their local government more, participate more and get involved - personally I&#039;d like to see really active block associations on the blocks in Southern Astoria - I think it would get people to get more active and it&#039;s a good way to get to know the rest of the people on your block.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s always disappointing when problems remain and are not resolved.

I do. Your office has done nothing about all the (fire-trap) illegal basement apartments all over Astoria. (Hmm, was that an illegal basement apartment you kept as a sleep-over joint?) Absolutely nothing. All you would have to do is read the Craigslist postings and then get Housing to go over and we could rid ourselves of this terrible blight of greedy home owners. And now let me talk about your input into Astoria&#039;s rezoning. If you look at the new rezoned map it becomes apparent that your home area is left so that it will not become destroyed, but not mine which will be totally destroyed. You, and your friends from CB1, including Judy Trilivas from Mt. Sinai of Queens Hospital, saw to it that 30th Road, from 29th Street to Crescent Street will be totally devastated. You and your friends think it is a good idea to build a nine story commercial building on a residential block all for greed. My family has been in Astoria since 1931. I grew up here. I raised my children here. I lost two husbands here. My roots are firmly planted here. I have lived in the same place since 1964, and I plan on fighting you to my death to stop this construction. How can you say that care about quality of life when this project will adversely impact the lives of all residents on this block. Seven 6 story buildings with more people than in many small towns. Is it that the Hospital made donations to your reelection committee and that endeared them to you, or do you really believe that it is nothing more than greed that they want to build on this block rather than finding a parcel of land and building. There are dozens of builders, including your other friend Joseph Pistilli, who would be glad to buy the land the Hospital currently sits on, and perhaps one of them could turn it into something beautiful that we could be proud of . . . not like one of the really crappy Pistilli properties we&#039;re dealing with.<br />&nbsp;

				Wow- First of all, I am pretty impressed that Mr. Vallone actually took the time to respond to this thread. That in and of itself is definitely a point for him in my book. Some of his opponents on this thread are bashing him and picking quotes out of context and calling him rude and/or disrespectful for it. <br />I did not see disrespectful responses from Mr. Vallone on either the queenscrap blog in response to Leavingsoon nor did I see any in his response in this thread. The OP and a few subsequent posts were a giant attack on Vallone in general, and I wouldn&#039;t expect a warm reception from him. I have been pretty on the fence about my opinions on Vallone, but having seen this transgression and reading Vallone&#039;s response, I am actually growing to be more of Vallone fan.<br /><br />Many of the folks bashing him here seem to be <span class="bbc_u">completely ignoring</span> that there are, in fact, many of their complaints that the Councilman has absolutely no control or influence over. Instead, the response to the Councilman are bits and pieces of quotes taken out of context accusing him of insulting his constituents or wanting to destroy Astoria.<br /><br />Honestly, I am as distrustful of politicians as most people. Seeing the types of baseless bashing that has been occurring on this thread have actually made me empathize a bit with politicians. On this thread, I definitely did see a lot of disrespect going on, and it is surely not coming from the councilman&#039;s end.

				This thread rules.<br /><br />First of all, is mcdirk physically capable of doing anything but defending the Queens machine? I&#039;ll stand corrected if you&#039;ve ever criticized an elected official (or his handpicked successor...) on this board -- and please do let me know if I&#039;m wrong, I just think it&#039;s hilarious that you&#039;re the most reliable defender of any elected on here.

Such as his Facebook post where he claimed that we were attacked on 9/11 because the terrorists hate our freedom. Yeah, that&#039;s circa 2003 &quot;freedom fries&quot; s___.

Seriously. Just get it done. I don&#039;t give a crap how many letters you write, how many people you talk with.... People are tired of keeping their windows closed because it smells like s___. Plain and simple. Your war on graffiti isn&#039;t doing anything. Put your effort towards something that is affecting people&#039;s health.

Secondly, I did not ignore NYC Mac User&#039;s post, it was not a post I was qualified to answer. <br />This is a perfect microcosm of the biggest problem in politics today: Politicians (Democrat, Republican, Independent, et al.) have relevant things on their agenda, but spend so much time trying to protect themselves from these people who blow little comments and ultimately irrelevant things out of proportion, that it takes away from the focus on the important issues. <br />Focusing on one random comment, and a <strong>rumor</strong> about him yelling at somebody is the equivalent of a Jerry Springer episode and takes away from your credibility as someone who actually cares about the well-being of Astoria. If you&#039;re going to attack the man, at least engage him on substance and acknowledge his responses whether you agree with them or not.

				In my personal dealings with the Councilman, I have found him responsive.&nbsp; I also think he has &#039;grown into&#039; his position over the years.&nbsp; It can&#039;t be easy.<br /><br />I have three criticisms -<br /><br />Once the first monstrosity went up in Astoria, bells and whistles should have gone off and that provincial narrow minded Pistilli should not have been allowed to develop anything.&nbsp; The re-zoning should have gone into affect 10 years ago.<br /><br />The only way any more venues in Astoria Park should be added is if they are adding the staff and necessities required to keep the venues going.&nbsp; No garbage cans, no skate board park.&nbsp; No staff, no thoughts of an ice skating rink.<br /><br />Finally, I feel that our Councilman should acknowledge that he is not a shoe-in for this position because of his family name.&nbsp; All the elderly in my neighborhood vote for him.&nbsp; Two of them passed away recently.&nbsp; Peter needs a new constituency and needs to win us over.&nbsp; I do think he is trying to do so...<br /><br />Oh, and one more thing - punctuation is important!

				I really didn&#039;t want to get involved in this thread but I will step in to speak up for mcdirk. I&#039;ve known mcdirk for several years and found him to be thoroughly fair in his assessment of elected officials. He&#039;s consistently pursued a results-oriented approach to local affairs without straying from his principles.<br /><br />Also, I think CM Vallone&#039;s willingness to respond to this thread shows that he does indeed make an effort to communicate with his constituents and respond to their concerns. I don&#039;t agree with him 100% of the time but calling for his impeachment is extraordinarily overblown and a bit hysterical.

				My apologies in advance for the longish post. <br /><br />I don’t feel the need to defend any member of the Vallone family who holds or has held elected office because nobody forced them and I feel that it’s their responsibility to take the bad along with the good that goes into serving in public office. <br /><br />My only comment is that the vitriol they inspire in some astounds me.

I have contacted two reporters from both the NY Times and Newsday. I have raised awareness both with my social circle and the internet. I have done above and beyond my share of the work, so I would appreciate you checking before you make an assumption about my lack or lack of involvement. People like Vallone, ELECTED officials, are the ones we give the power to take care of such issues. What is the point of having him around then when he can&#039;t take care of the things that we have real problems with. I have my own job to take care of. I can&#039;t spend every other moment doing Vallone&#039;s job. That just isn&#039;t fair.
