				First someone pulled the rubber out of my windshield wipers in the middle of a blizzard.<br /><br />Next a plow took off my driver&#039;s side mirror.<br /><br />Followed by my passenger front window being smashed and my radio stolen.<br /><br />That was nothing.<br /><br />Last night at 10:30, my neighbor (thank god!) rang my doorbell.&nbsp; She had recognized my car around the corner and said I needed to go check it out...there was an accident.&nbsp; I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and headed out.&nbsp; My car was parked on 36th Avenue at the corner of Crescent.&nbsp; By the time I got there everyone was gone except two police officers filling out paperwork.<br /><br />Apparently, someone blew a red light, hit another car, which spun around and hit mine.&nbsp; It looked bad.&nbsp; My car is, for all intents and purposes, totaled.&nbsp; Luckily, both drivers stopped (or couldn&#039;t drive away?) and both were insured.&nbsp; I now have to go after someone&#039;s insurance company.&nbsp; Sadly, they are likely to give me much less than it is going to cost to replace my car.<br /><br />My car is undrivable.&nbsp; It&#039;s still sitting there on the side of the road.&nbsp; I can&#039;t pick up the accident report until Thursday.&nbsp; With street cleaning tomorrow (Wednesday), I&#039;ll probably get a ticket.&nbsp; I guess that&#039;s still cheaper than having it towed to a lot somewhere.&nbsp; I&#039;ll let the insurance company do that.<br /><br />Anyway, thanks for reading my rant.&nbsp; If anyone has some grotesque interest, I&#039;ll try to post some pictures soon.<br /><br />And now the search for a new used car.&nbsp; Anyone selling?<br /><br />Adam

				I&#039;m not sure if this will work here, but when I was in high school and my car got wrecked by a similar I was parked, other guy screwed up situation, I yelled and complained and raised hell with his insurance and they paid for my parking tickets and the tow job. It takes being a bit of a jerk on the phone, but it worked. <br /><br />The trick, I find, is to be pissed off, but apologize to the person you&#039;re talking to. The whole &quot;I know it&#039;s not your fault, but it&#039;s really upsetting me and I feel like it&#039;s ridiculous that I&#039;m in the hole for this s___&quot; works wonders.

				Sorry to hear about your car getting hit. That really stinks.&nbsp; If you&nbsp; do get a ticket, I would second the recomendation to complain to the insurance co.&nbsp; It is worth a try..<br /><br />At least you were able to get the insurance information. My husbands car was hit last year while it was parked&nbsp; and the jerk who hit his car took off. We wound up paying $1,000 out of pocket (deductible) and being without a car for 2 weeks.

				Your insurance may pay for a towing service - call your agent and explain the situation. Even if they tow it to a garage; wherever.&nbsp; I bet its covered under your policy. <br />&nbsp;

				The nearby intersection of 24th St and 36th Ave is <em>rife</em> with collisions and near-collisions. &nbsp;Whenever possible, with your next car, don&#039;t park on 36th Ave, or near it. &nbsp;That&#039;s the corner I live on, and hear these events all the time.<br /><br />Better luck in the future.

				ugh, I feel for you. I got my tag stolen just days after moving to Astoria. I sought out paid parking and so far so good. For me, every time I get in my car it&#039;s like a high school parking lot flashback - what now?!? I swear, how hard is it to NOT sideswipe someone?&nbsp; :evil:<br /><br />It&#039;s noticeably just child-like malicious behavior too, like your wiper blades and radio. My radio antenna was also stolen, so there ya go. Now I take every possible removable thing off my car while it&#039;s parked.<br /><br />When does school start again? I was too scared shitless to do stuff like this as a kid.

				A similar thing happened to me a few years back (also in Astoria).&nbsp; It sucks, I know.<br /><br />Just part of the territory when there are 1,000 cars parked in a 10 block radius (not literaly, but, you get the idea).

It really stinks. The only suggestion that I can offer is to try to find a quiet street to park on, even if it means walking a little farther back to your apartment. I learned my lesson after 2 incidents - I live on Steinway. Of course, as I type this, my car is parked on Steinway. (It&#039;s street cleaning tomorrow morning! I&#039;m not losing my spot!)

				Sorry to hear about this Adam. I&#039;ve lived in almost every part of Astoria over the years, including on 36th Avenue, and out of all the areas of the neighborhood, I have to say I had the most trouble with my car when I lived there.<br /><br />Now this is many years ago but every month either my car or my roommate&#039;s car had its window smashed in. It wasn&#039;t fun and wasn&#039;t cheap.<br /><br />Good luck and I hope you&#039;re able to put everything right soon.

				As someone who&#039;s had a car stolen and totaled, then replaced it with a new car only to have the wheels stolen, and bumpers scraped to hell, I can sympathize. <br />Oh, and my motorcycle has been knocked over about a dozen times without so much as a note.<br />I&#039;ve just come to terms with the fact that people are A-holes.

				Thanks for all the posts!&nbsp; It does feel good to have other people to commiserate with.&nbsp; That said, it really bums me out how common this stuff is.&nbsp; <br /><br />I full intend to work the insurance company to the bone - I&#039;m gonna get my $1500 if it kills me ;-)<br /><br />I don&#039;t carry collision insurance, so my ins. company won&#039;t do anything for me.&nbsp; I&#039;m just hoping I can get the other company to tow the car.<br /><br />The frustrating thing is that I never park in that spot.&nbsp; I live on 24th St between 36th and 37th aves.&nbsp; A nice street, but lots of incidents there.&nbsp; I always find a spot on my block, but that day, it just didn&#039;t happen.&nbsp; A couple cars taking up two spots and nothing for me.&nbsp; I pulled into that spot on 36th ave and said to my wife &quot;This is a bad corner, we really shouldn&#039;t be parking here.&quot;&nbsp; Alas, I didn&#039;t take my own advice and that night it got smashed.&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t even that close to the corner - a good 10 feet from the corner.<br /><br />Anyway, I get the police report tomorrow and start calling insurance companies.<br />

				Here&#039;s one more. About 15 years ago it must be, my girlfriend left my VW Rabbit unlocked while she ran into a laundromat on 23rd Ave. to check on some clothes. When she came out, someone had removed and taken the entire instrument panel - speedometer, tach, radio, etc.

				yesterday morning as we passed our car on the way to the train station we noticed someone pulled off a chunk of the side of our roof rack since we parked it there less than 12 hours ago.<br />who does that? why? <br />John thinks it&#039;s the other car on our street that is identical to ours-even the plates are similar. can&#039;t tell you how many time we do a double take b/c we think our car is getting jacked. <br /><br />oh yeah, and around January or something, someone busted our passenger side window looking for our gps b/c john left the holder on the windshield (don&#039;t do that! and wipe off the mark left behind too!). They got that, the charger, our mag light and his tums. Good to know the bastard has heartburn.

				The increase&nbsp; in what I call &#039;street people&#039;, in my neighborhood, has also caused an increase&nbsp; in things stolen off and inside cars. You see anyone&nbsp; &#039;hanging out&#039; all day, you don&#039;t know,&nbsp; in the neighborhood,espcially looking inside cars and yards, call the cops. As for the nutty drivers, this is a &#039;summer&#039; in the city past time, as Astoria&nbsp; is&nbsp; a&nbsp; transfer&nbsp; point for bridges.

				All is done.&nbsp; Very long story, but I&#039;ve settled with the insurance company and they are sending me a check.&nbsp; More than I&#039;d ever get by selling my car, but not really enough to replace it.

				Its really not safe to park in Astoria. I live on 30th Drive and normally park in my buildings garage but because my mom was visiting, i let her have my spot and parked on the street. last night, someone broke into my car and stole my GPS, mounting thing for GPS, ipod, charger, headset for my phone and the connector from ipod to radio and the chargers that go in the lighter. the cops came, filed a police report and said these things happen a lot around here.... what a day! I hope my insurance will cover it.

				That sucks. A few weeks ago, our car window was smashed in the middle of the night. They stole our ten-dollar XM radio. (LOL) It actually wasn&#039;t the most expensive thing in our car, the thief obviously didn&#039;t know what he was doing and just wanted to make a quick buck. It cost us a pretty penny to fix that dang window, but XM took pity on us and gave us a new radio for free.&nbsp; :-D A neighbor&#039;s daughter&#039;s car was robbed from too. They stole her brand new thousand-dollar-each tires. Which sucked too.&nbsp; :-(
