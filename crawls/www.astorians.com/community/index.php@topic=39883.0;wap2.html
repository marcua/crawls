			Hi there,<br /><br /><br />My ex-mother in law is in a housing predicament, and is in need of an apartment. She is a married woman currently living with me to take care of my son while I&#039;m at work. Her husband (who lives in California) hasn&#039;t provided her with proof of income for almost a year now. She has a substantial amount of money in her bank account and near perfect credit, but the paperwork has been a hard stop. $1200 max for an apartment hopefully for the new year.<br /><br /><br />Any leads would be wildly appreciated!

			If she has no proof of reliable income she might have to do like the college students do and either get a personal guarantee from somebody who does have excellent credit/provable income or use a service like https://www.insurent.com/ to guarantee payment to the landlord.<br /><br /><br /><br />
