				I felt the need to bump this (hitherto unreplied to) topic to the front for a number of reasons.<br /><br />Explain:<br />I have <em>two</em> (2) distinct interests or &quot;hobbies&quot;.<br />One is the Political (which most of you may now know that have examined or been subjected to my endless Rants).<br /><br />The Second is the Technological, which I have seen holds the keys to many solutions. Not exclusively the technologies themselves, but rather the &quot;mindset&quot; of those who explore and invest time into these technologies.<br /><br />Here the two intersect.<br /><br />This topic is yet another subtle reminder of what awaits those who ignore these two issues.<br />Those who are either undecided or uncommitted on where they stand.<br /><br />We have seen the fruits of what happens when &quot;voting&quot; becomes the domain of licensing and proprietership. Partisan or not, the effects are unmistakable.<br /><br />I implore you to read the above linked article. Read it again and look back upon the archives of this humble forum to see where they overlap or are otherwise pertinent.<br />( http://astorians.com/index.php?topic=117.0 &amp; http://astorians.com/index.php?topic=116.0 are good examples.)<br /><br />For those who have been with us long it has been made clear that this issue must surely affect us on a very real and intrinsic level. This is not some prophetic or precautionary tale... rather it is the clinical dissection of what has already come to pass. No Cassandra&#39;s here... only unemotionally tainted History.<br /><br />Blackbox voting is not in the interests of a free state, and if we allow such practices to continue then surely we are condoning not Democracy or Federal Republicanism, but rather unmistakeable Tyranny, plain and simple; and that in a very <em>real</em> and experiential sense.<br /><br />-zero<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />&quot;A question continually reverberates within my Mind. Do I value the ideals of comfort over the value of freedom? And how long can I remain in comfort if I am not free?&quot;- Anon.<br /><br />

				I&#39;m not against electronic voting. But I do find this deeply disturbing. If we&#39;re going to use electronic voting procedures I&#39;d like to see an open-source solution implemented. In this particular issue there&#39;s no question that it&#39;s in the interest of the public that free and open software be used to tabulate votes. Anyone, of any political party should be able to look at the underlying software and data that is used to tabulate votes to ensure that votes are being counted properly. The actions of this company, and the majority republican party in AK are saddening, not to mention anti-democratic.<br /><br />I can&#39;t see this standing up in any reasonable court of law, and I hope it does get to go before a court.

				My hobby (unless the major leagues draft me at my age) is politics.<br />Anything related to technology is of interest largely due to any usefulness as a tool.<br /><br />Certainly with voting reforms being acted on now, this topic is rather important.<br />If anyone would like to discuss and has particular input on legislation that might occur in Albany, please let me know at your convenience.<br /><br />I will be joining others in Albany in April and will likely have informal discussions with activists (perhaps on related topics) before then.<br /><br />Thank you.<br />Thomas<br /><br />Merms post is right on the mark. And, I hope all might agree that there should be a paper trail when voting occurs. (Currently in NY, I think we take it on faith that our votes are actually counted.<br />I know one year that my voting was not acknowledged but the election outcome was never in doubt.)
