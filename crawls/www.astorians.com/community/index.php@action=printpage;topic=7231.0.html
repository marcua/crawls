				It sure did..............it said &quot;Gus&#039; Tavern Restaurant Bar&quot; in a line from top to bottom and it was neon in different colors............and it blinked. There were also lights to light up what I called the &quot;terrace&quot; (roof of bar) which was outside the bedroom window. You can see them in the old picture. I used to drag my bike down two flights of stairs, and up again, every day. I want to see it again.............. :|

				That is absolutely gorgeous!! Thanks so much for sharing that!! I never saw 30th avenue like that. I grew up right around the corner from the 114th precinct. Oh wait I think they built that in 1973.... anyways I grew up on 36th street between Astoria Blvd and 28th Ave. I used to walk up and down 30th ave and steinway as a kid. Every weekend after our chores my mom would buy us 45&#039;s on Steinway at the record shop. That&#039;s gone too..... so many memories for me and I am so awed by your picture. Thanks again!!! You rock!

				You rock too!!! Steinway St...............Used to walk up and down that street with my friends......I also remember almost drowning in Astoria pool. They thought I was kidding until I didn&#039;t come up anymore. Then someone finally pulled me out. I never learned to swim, even though I spent the rest of my life in Miami. I remember a place called&nbsp; the &quot;Mayfair&quot;...up the street towards the El. The teenagers hung there.......it was a wild place, at least for the time. Halloween in Astoria was great! Almost everybody gave us money. I will have to go to that Cafe across from my bldg. on Newtown Ave. It was a gathering place even back then and I watched it from the fire escape. Don&#039;t want to bore you to death. Maybe we&#039;ll meet one day cause I REALLY want to come up there.&nbsp; :wink:

				Haha!! You aren&#039;t boring me at all! Love to hear the memories. Astoria Pool reminds me of the time we snuck in at night (as teenagers)....got busted about a half hour later by the cops. They just told us to get out and we should know better! <br />You really should make a trip back to your old neighborhood, especially because it was a place of fond memories.....By the El train. I love it! What was the number or letter of the train back then? I remember it being RR then B and now it&#039;s the N or W. I might be boring you now with my trip down the memory lane !!&nbsp; :lol:

				Never happen..............I love hearing other peoples memories of the &quot;neighborhood&quot;...........I went to PS 5...just threw that in. For some reason we walked up and down Steinway St. a lot. And rode our bikes all over. We used to aggravate a man named W.E.Bowen, who owned and ran the liquor store just around the corner from me towards Steinway St. There was an empty lot across the street from me to the right, where I took my dog every day to play and run around. And go potty. I think that&#039;s where the big Market is now. It had been a mansion that was torn down, or burned down. Nothing was left but the big gate and chimney. I thought it was the greatest thing, to play with my dog in all that open space. The bar under my apt. played Eddie Fisher&#039;s &quot;Anytime&quot; which was a big hit then............they played it constantly and I liked it. Yes, I&#039;m trying to get up there. And if I can&#039;t, well................ :killme:

				WOw! I can go on and on. Steinway is still a great place to walk up and down. Lots of shopping. As for school I don&#039;t think there is a P.S. 5 anymore in Astoria. There is a P.S. 70 on 42nd or 43rd st. between 30th and 31st avenue. There is also JHS 10 that used to be called P.S. 10 on 31st avenue I think between 45th and 46th street. It&#039;s amazing how some things stay the same and others will change. <br />I am so happy they didn&#039;t knock down the building you lived in. Its so important to keep those buildings. They have knocked down so many two family homes and made them into these bigger apartment buildings. I don&#039;t know most of neighbors. It&#039;s very different now. There are so many people moving in and out every month from all over the place. It&#039;s kind of sad....... :cry:&nbsp;

				Mama Mac told me they tore down PS 5 and built another school on the spot. It must be the one on 42 st. because I walked there and back everyday..........couldn&#039;t have been that far. I used to stop at a pet shop on the way to school and slobber all over the puppies.............one of which I finally got and took a picture of on the roof of the bar..............I called it the &quot;terrace&quot;..........sounded very Hollywood!! I&#039;m glad they didn&#039;t tear it down too............I would have had to go under my blankie and stay there a while.&nbsp; :-(&nbsp; I remember a candy store where I used to get a Little Lulu comic book, orange soda and a pretzel.....for a quarter.

				PS 5 used to be on 29th Street and 30th Road. Also PS 6. It used to be where the minicipal parking lot is on Steinway. When they closed PS 5 I was transferred to PS 6. What memories! Does anyone remember Norgaards on 30th Avenue? Or the Avon Bakery on 30th Avenue? Or the Kosher deli on the corner of 30th Avenue and 36th Street, where Frank&#039;s Bakery is now? Or the DeRose Pharmacy on the corner of 29th Street and 30th Avenue where ther is now a cafe? How about Sokol&#039;s on Steinway?<br />

				Across the street from (your old address) the saloon was the A&amp;P, where Key Food is now. I can vividly remember when my Mom found out that all the Ann Page canned foods were made and packaged by Del Monte. She went shopping on their annual canned goods sale and we had no room to put all the stuff she bought! But, she said she saved a fortune by buying Ann Page instead of Del Monte and that made it all worth while. <br /><br />You know something, I just this second realized why I can&#039;t stomach canned anything. I always hated canned vegetables and fruits. I have such a passion for fresh produce. When I left home, in 1964, I had a very small, Italian green-grocer around the corner from me on 30th Avenue between 29th and 30th Streets. He would save for me bushels of too-soft-to-sell egg tomatoes and I would make my own sauces. I would give him a few jars and some home baked breads and pies in exchange for the tomatoes. I can even remember the day I discovered that instead of jarring my sauces I could freeze them. What a time saving. I still do it that way. <br /><br />This whole thread makes me melancholy.

				Anybody old enough to remember voting for the &quot;Rhinegold Beer Girl&quot;? Every store in the neighborhood had a cardboard box and a pencil on a string. you could vote for your favorite &quot;girl&quot; (pictures were displayed) and put it in the slot in the box.
