				Hello, everybody.<br />Had an amazing 60 minute massage yesterday at this brand new yoga/massage studio right off Ditmars Blvd subway stop. They just opened 3 weeks ago and are running these crazy deals to promote themselves. Their owner, a licensed massage therapist and yoga teacher, gave me a fabulous massage under their insane december special $39/hour for first-time clients. She has 12 years of massage therapy experience. Their studio looks unassuming from the outside, but inside it is all moroccan lanterns and golden curtains. She worked out all the knots in my back and neck and she used some special herbal oil from india. I just really loved their little studio and the massage was good, I can&#039;t believe the price. She says she will change it back to the original 65$ in a few weeks. I highly recommend them. Call them at 347-257-7768. Their name is Creative Vibrations Yoga Studio. address: N/W to Ditmars Blvd stop, walk down token booth mezzanine, after real estate office turn left behind internet cafe Suite #200. Street number: 22-55 31st street. Get there fast before the crazy good rate is over. Good luck. B.

				just went to their website at www.creativevibrationsstudio.com/massage.htm, but i dont see any deals for $39/hour! Their rate is $65, it does not say $39 anywhere! i &#039; ll give them a buzz tomorrow anyways, their website looks nice. I could use a good massage for sure, esp. for a crazy rate like that! Sky.

				Dear B. Thanks so much for your good words! This is Lalita, you had a massage with me 2 days ago. I was just reading though astorians and came upon you guys, very exciting that people are writing about our studio. We are very unique in many ways. <br /><br />What really upset me is posts like &quot;Darn good massage found&quot; that i also came upon a few weeks back with 8000 views. The problem is their massage venue does not have licensed or schooled therapists, they are a couple of chinese business-owners that learn massage from videos or each other i assume and then have the gut to open a business and present competition for licensed therapists like me. It is ironic that someone like myself with 2 years full-time training at the Swedish Insitute of Massage in New York&nbsp; and a New York state license has to compete with these &quot;darn good massage providers&quot; who have neither massage therapy license nor proper schooling, but they do have darn good advertisers and the State is doing nothing to stop them from interferring with legitimate professionals. It is as if any one would read a few books on medicine and then open a doctor&#039;s business and call themselves a doctor. The darn good massage place is an unlicensed unschooled bunch of self-trained witch-therapists!:) Do not support their work. People like myself have busted their ass to obtain legitimate qualifications and training. <br />As far as the 39$ deal for first-time clients at our studio, that offer is on a postcard we circulated around astoria. if you come and present it, I will honor it. Otherwise, the 39$ rate if for midday hours between 11:30 to 3:30 daily. Any other tim it is $65 for 1 hour treatment and it is by appointment. <br />Astorians, please support legitimate licensed massage practitioners and their professional efforts. Thanks. Lalita
