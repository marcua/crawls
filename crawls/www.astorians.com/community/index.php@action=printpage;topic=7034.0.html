				I can&#039;t listen to work in my office (oddly, I&#039;m the only one who is not allowed music here), but recently I&#039;ve been listening to late 80&#039;s R &amp; B - Regina Bell, Natalie Cole, Mikki Howard, Stephanie Mills, Prince&#039;s slow jams (Scandolous from the Batman soundtrack, I believe), and many more. <br /><br />I always listen to the music I grew up on 70&#039;s album rock and soft rock, new wave and punk and the first rap I ever heard!<br /><br />Is that too much?<br />

Great movie- I definitely recommend it- though it is quite depressing.&nbsp; I can&#039;t get &quot;She&#039;s Lost Control&#039; out of my head. I love that song!!<br /><br />I also really enjoyed &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot;. It was hard to keep from dancing in my seat when I saw that film.

				Just curious, when you listen to a Metallica song, are you able to quit after just hearing one song? What is their best song after 2000?<br /><br /><br />otherwise for your listening enjoyment with your coffee -<br /><br />&nbsp;http://www.myspace.com/justinthompson <br /><br />&nbsp; coming to Waltz Astoria Dec. 19<br /><br /><br />Also recently heard an interesting guitarist in the subway, but trying to remember the name

				No, I usually listen to about 15 or 20, can&#039;t quit after just one!&nbsp; :-D<br /><br />Well they just released a new album a few months back which is AMAZING!<br /><br />If I had to choose a best song it would either be The Judas Kiss or The Day That Never Comes. <br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZ5zXXUJsyc&amp;feature=related

Back in my metal days (1982-1995) I had that album stolen so many times I lost count. You see it was in the days when cd&#039;s first came out and each one was damned expensive, like $20-25 EACH. And of course seeing them in concert was even better. When I saw them in 1990 ( I think...) they did a 15 min version of Master.

				Fairytale of New York is a wonderful song! I&#039;m not sure how it would sound today if Shane McGowan sang it, but If I Should Fall from Grace...; and Rum, Sodomy... are classic Pogues albums-never gets old!!

				Been listening to two artist that were recently introduced to me.<br /><br />I&#039;m really into guitarist (Satriani, Vai, Johnson, Van Halen, Vaughan, the usual suspects).&nbsp; But someone introduced me to Joe Bonamassa.&nbsp; Apparently, he&#039;s been judged the &quot;best&quot; Blues guitarist (a title which is inherrently subjective).&nbsp; But after hearing some of his songs on Rhapsody, the guy is the real deal.&nbsp; His song &quot;Sloe Gin&quot; has great tone and soul.&nbsp; His CD &quot;Live from Nowhere In Particular&quot; is great!&nbsp; If you&#039;re into good guitar and blues, definately check this guy out.<br /><br />And by accident, I was listening to this song by a band called &quot;Ra&quot;.&nbsp; They have a new CD, so they were playing the first song off the CD called &quot;Broken Hearted Soul&quot;.&nbsp; One word....AWESOME!!&nbsp; Not as hard as say, Metallica, but still had a nice crunch in thier sound and good melodies.&nbsp; Very hard sound to describe.&nbsp; The closest I can come to is &quot;Alice in Chains, only less dark and more rythm&quot;.&nbsp; If nothing else, check out &quot;Broken Hearted Soul&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;:mrgreen:

				NYC Goalie--<br /><br />If you like guitarists, a great album to check out is &quot;Doc &amp; Dawg&quot; -- it&#039;s Doc Watson and David Grisham just jamming along in Watson&#039;s basement to some great classic blues standards.<br /><br />Franky and Johnny (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKj3lSJpTXQ&amp;feature=related) is one of my favorite songs they do. That version is just Watson, but he&#039;s got some serious skills when they break the songs down. I wish I could find the Doc &amp; Dawg version to show you.<br /><br /><br />EDIT: This (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUrg2Cqxdw) shows some of Watson&#039;s superb picking skills.
