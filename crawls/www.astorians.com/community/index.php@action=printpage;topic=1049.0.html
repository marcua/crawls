				(I'm not sure if this belongs here or in the &quot;Where can I find...&quot; section)<br /><br />I don't cook and I rely mostly on those ubiquitous Manhattan hot/cold buffets to eat balanced meals. I got it down to where I could get a satisfying and (fairly) healthful lunch for around 5 bucks.<br /><br />However, I'm spending more of my days here in the hood b/c I got laid off (again), and am having a hard time finding decent -- and cheap -- places to eat.<br /><br />Like I said, I don't cook, and even when I've made the attempt, I wound up throwing away more than I used since I live alone.<br /><br />Is there anything like a good salad bar/buffet in Astoria???

				I can't think of any salad bars/buffets offhand, but here's the link to the Time Out NY &quot;Cheap Eats&quot; article that featured Astoria (30th Ave). Might be some good options there:<br /><br />http://www.timeoutny.com/features/473/473.astoria.html

				I don't know what part of Astoria you're in, but the food place attached to the Rock on 31st just off of Ditmars offers one of those &quot;build your own salad&quot; bars. &nbsp;It's not super cheap, though.<br /><br />I really like the souvlaki lady on the corner of Ditmars and 33rd, right by the Thessaloniki jewlers, for cheap eats. &nbsp;A chicken or pork souvlaki on a stick is $2, and on a pita with all the toppings and sauces, it's $3. &nbsp;If you get it on a pita, it's easily a full meal.<br /><br />Buon Appetit deli makes very large sandwiches for about $5.50, and you can get the same filling on a large bed of greens for $6.50, I think. &nbsp;Each sandwich or salad lasts me two meals, plus a soda or chips or whatever for another dollar or so.

				Buon Appetit is on the south side of Ditmars between 36th and 37th. &nbsp;The owner's name is John.<br /><br />Here's (http://www.queenstribune.com/archives/diningguide/reviews/buonappetitdeli.htm) a little blurb with hours and phone number. &nbsp;(that lists the sandwich prices as $5, but they've gone up to $5.50 since he renovated.)
