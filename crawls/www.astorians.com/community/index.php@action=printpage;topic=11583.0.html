				So there was Never (N), the Rarely (R), and now, the Worst (W)!&nbsp; According to a new report by the Straphangers Campaign, the W came in last.&nbsp; The link to the AM NY site is below, along with the relevant paragraph.&nbsp; The link to the Straphangers report appears below the link.<br /><br />http://www.amny.com/news/local/transportation/subway/am-subway0730,0,4847785.story<br /><br />&quot;Besides giving an overall snapshot, the report ranks the lines individually. For the third consecutive year the W train came in last. The W has the longest scheduled wait at 10 minutes, has one of the worst breakdown rates at every 87,000 miles, and shows up on time just 84% of the time.&quot;<br /><br />http://www.straphangers.org/statesub08/<br />

				It&#039;s a little unfair, in that the W couldn&#039;t be run more frequently even if the MTA had the budget to do so. There&#039;s just too much of a bottleneck with the NRQ lines (which probably are the cause of many of those delays). As well, the W doesn&#039;t run weekends or nights, where on-time rates are much higher, so it get&#039;s penalized relative to 24/7 lines. Also, the stats don&#039;t yet reflect the more reliable shiny new trains that are starting to show up on the W line, replacing those cars whose doors always failed.<br /><br />Still, they are pretty dirty and covered with scratchiti...<br />

				Seriously even with all the bottle necking... i would be ok with a few more express trains in the morning stopping at Ditmars, Astoria, and Broadway.... sorry for everyone else but it would make the trains flow a little better.

				Hah, got on the top-ranked L train yesterday evening during rush hour, and it had a very W-like problem! The doors wouldn&#039;t all close, so after 15 minutes of trouble-shooting, they kicked everyone off and we had to all pile on the next train.

				The bottleneck has to Ditmars Blvd in the morning.&nbsp; I get on every morning at Astoria Blvd (usually 8:20’ish) and I can’t tell you how many times we are in a situation where our Manhattan-bound platform is full people waiting, I see two trains endlessly sitting at the Ditmars Blvd, a Ditmars-bound train waiting to leave Astoria Blvd but can’t, and yet another Ditmars-bound train behind it waiting to pull into Astoria Blvd (but can&#039;t).&nbsp; I’ve often stood there for the 5, 10, 15 minutes scratching my head wondering, ‘is the conductor stuck on the toilet or something?&nbsp; :? At least move a train to Astoria Blvd so all these backed up trains can pull into Ditmars.’&nbsp; &nbsp;:x&nbsp; <br /><br />When a train FINALLY pulls out of Ditmars Blvd and the doors open we are usually greeted to a message of the train running express to Queensboro Plaza&nbsp; 8-) but there would be no need for this if they just kept the trains moving like they are supposed to be.&nbsp; :lol: Can one who regularly gets on at Ditmars explain what is going on over there on mornings like this?&nbsp; Have the trains broken down?&nbsp; <br />
