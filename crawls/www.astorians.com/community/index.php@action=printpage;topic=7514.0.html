				Grab your jump balls and sign the petition<br />This was/is a GREAT bit of TV<br /><br /><br />Any show that uses &quot;johnny Appleseed&quot; as the theme song...<br /><br />Has to stay<br /><br />

				I don&#039;t know, Butchie, instead.<br /><br />I would love to see this show get another season.&nbsp; It seems like people either love it or hate it, and from what I&#039;ve read it seems like the haters are winning out.&nbsp; I thought it was just so weird and hilarious...made me come back each week.&nbsp; <br /><br />I GOT MY EYE ON YOU!

				What IS it with this show? My ex, with whom I parted on poor terms and haven&#039;t spoken to in a year and a half, sent me a text message a few weeks ago simply reading, &quot;Check out John of Cincinnati. Trust me on this.&quot; (!!?!)<br /><br />Is it <em>really</em> good enough to make one tiptoe around heartbreak? Like, <em>really?</em>

				i watched one episode and all i could think was <em>this</em> is what Deadwood bit the dust for?<br /><br />it made me miss Deadwood all the more. <br />actually i&#039;m hoping if HBO drops this show they can get Deadwood back somehow.

				I don&#039;t think John from Cincinnati had anything to do with no more Deadwoods.&nbsp; I heard that the end of Deadwood had something to do with money differences between Milch and HBO.&nbsp; There was talk about a Deadwood movie for HBO, but now that seems to have cooled off.&nbsp; And then Milch made John from Cincinnati as his next project, not instead of.<br /><br />I do miss Deadwood, very much.

So they decided not to renew Deadwood. I was sooo happy about the movies that were planned, but the chances of them happening now are probably very slim.<br />good news is season 3 is on DVD. will be getting to that soon.

				Thats funny.&nbsp; I had read an article in the New Yorker that basically said since HBO gives its show creators free reign with minimal executive intrusion that&#039;s why it&#039;s able to produce great and original shows like Deadwood and the Sopranos.&nbsp; But since there aren&#039;t any network execs trying to bring the whole thing to a lowest common denominator level, you&#039;re also going to get shows like John from Cincinnati, which don&#039;t seem to make sense to anyone but the creator.&nbsp; Its the price we pay for mostly really good TV.<br /><br />I know this is a Save John from Cincinnati thread, but I watched every episode and I did not like it at all.&nbsp; I hope Milch moves on to something else that turns out to be spectacular.&nbsp; And I hope it still includes Ed O&#039;Neill b/c I do like that guy.
