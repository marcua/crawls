				Does anyone know of a good mexican joint in Astoria? &nbsp;I'm not looking for something too ethnic...I know that sounds stupid...but somewhere where I can get fajitas...some people would say TexMex. <br />Thanks

				Good luck on this one.<br /><br />Los Amigos on 31st (right by the Ditmars stop) is not bad for authentic Mexican. It's hard to get good mexican in NYC in general but Los Amigos gives it a good try.

				Los amigos is a good pick. &nbsp;its an all mexican crowd as the evening gets going.<br /><br />there is a very good place (i hear) on 38th street just south of broadway. buts its authentic mexican.<br /><br />tex mex is tough to find out here, I just call fresco torilla when i want decent tex mex mexican food. 30th ave by 37th street.<br /><br />if you find what you are looking for I'd love to hear about it.

				Viva El Mariachi on Broadway may look dodgy, but it is the best Mexican food in Astoria hands down. &nbsp;Trust me, I've tried it all.

				I've tried all of these mentioned so far and I hate them all. Granted, before moving to NYC I lived in California where Mexican food was good in just about any restaurant you ate at.<br /><br />Mexican food in NYC is horrible. I've yet to find a place that can make me a good tasting, simple mexican meal.

				I'm sorry to pass the buck but lanseaux and megc pointed out a place to me on the way to the CSA that looked pretty damn authentic (also hidden away) and they stand by it. Alas, I haven't gotten to eat there yet and I even forgot the name, but I remember being impressed by what was said (as well as by who was saying it) and when it comes to Mexican food I am not easily impressed.<br /><br />-Zeno (content-free)
