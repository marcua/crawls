				I&#039;m in a little bit of a pickle.&nbsp; My boyfriend is in the process of trying to find a finance job in NYC (arghhh...), but he currently lives out of state.&nbsp; We were hoping he would have found a job by the time my lease is up on August 31st, but it&#039;s looking like that probably won&#039;t happen.&nbsp; So I&#039;m looking to rent a room in Astoria on a month-to-month basis starting September 1st.&nbsp; Once he finds a job, I will move out (after giving sufficient notice) and we will get a place together.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br /><strong>About me</strong>: I&#039;m a professional in my early 20s working in Manhattan.&nbsp; Responsible and easy going. No smoking, no drugs, no pets.&nbsp; I leave for work around 8:45am and get home usually around 7:30pm.&nbsp; I like to cook dinner most nights and wouldn&#039;t mind sharing meals occasionally.&nbsp; I try to keep utility bills down as much as possible.&nbsp; I like to watch TV occasionally, but only watch one show on a regular basis (Mondays @ 9pm!) so I wouldn&#039;t be a TV/living room hog.&nbsp; Deathly afraid of mice.. so if you know that you have them, please tell me... or else I&#039;ll be crying in my room every single night.&nbsp; (It&#039;s pathetic, but whatever.)&nbsp; My boyfriend is in his mid-20s and will come to visit usually one weekend a month.&nbsp; He&#039;s normal and respectful with a good job and a Masters Degree.&nbsp; No one that you would need to be worried about being in your home. <br /><br /><strong>About you</strong>: Looking for someone around the same age, but flexible depending on the situation.&nbsp; No smoking, no drugs, no pets.&nbsp; Do not want to live with a couple (I&#039;m currently escaping that situation!) or with someone who has their bf/gf over several nights a week.&nbsp; Clean and respectful.&nbsp; Not passive-aggressive.&nbsp; Willing to split living expenses like toilet paper, hand soap, etc.&nbsp; Oh and please be normal... no drama.&nbsp; I can&#039;t stress this enough! <br /><br />Thanks!&nbsp; :-)<br />
