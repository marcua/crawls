				Hey guys--<br /><br />I&#039;m having terrible back pains. On my way back from work yesterday, walking home was one of the worst things I&#039;ve ever done. I pulled out the futon on the living room and spent the night lying on the hard mattress. I woke up this morning and felt okay until I stood up to get a cup of water. Just a few seconds of walking around and my back is clenched up again.<br /><br />My normal doctor is by my office in Manhattan and can&#039;t do anything over the phone for me and I really don&#039;t want to subject myself to a long bumpy cab ride.<br /><br />Can anyone recommend a doctor in Astoria that might be able to see me? I&#039;d prefer to go to a doctor over a chiropractor, because chiropractors kinda freak me out and this feels like it&#039;s really pretty serious. <br /><br />I live on Crescent St just around the corner of 30th Ave and briefly toyed with the idea of walking down to the hospital on the corner but I remember hearing bad bad things about that place.<br /><br />I have Blue Cross/Blue Shield.<br /><br />Any ideas or advice of what to do would be really great.<br /><br />Thanks guys.

				long story short, doctors are going to most likely give you muscle relaxers to treat the immediate pain issues and then check for serious damage - herniated discs, etc. if it&#039;s that bad you need to get to a doc asap. they can recommend you an ortho guy from there out if it&#039;s something really bad. if you trust your regular doctor it might be worth the terrible cab ride, presuming you&#039;re close to someplace you can get xrays/mri done.<br /><br />as a side note, i&#039;ve found the right chiropractor is great for keeping one&#039;s back from being a terrible mess or backsliding into shittiness. but for acute care you want to hit a standard/ortho doc first.

				I have recently been to the ER at MT Sinai and it suxs.&nbsp; Also, they don&#039;t have an MRI machine so if you need an MRI they are going to send you elsewhere.&nbsp; If you can find a doctor locally (don&#039;t have one, sorry) I would say try them..but I agree..they will probably give you muscle relaxer.&nbsp; If this happened from the Futon odds are it is just a muscle problem and will go away in a day or two.<br /><br />Feel better and good luck.

				Sounds like back spasms, which can be caused by any number of things, including but not limited to disc issues or vertebral subluxations (spine not lining up properly).&nbsp; I know you don&#039;t want to do it, but a chiropracter may be your best bet, although a massage therapist may also be of help.&nbsp; Unfortunately I don&#039;t know any chiros in the neighborhood anymore, but I can recommend 2 in Manhattan (one of whom I work with).&nbsp; PM me if you want their info.

I&#039;ve occasionally been a bit stiff after a night of sleep, but never like this.<br /><br />Dr. Joannow in Astoria was recommended to me and I&#039;ll be going there at 2:30. <br /><br />At this point, I&#039;ve kinda realized that this is going to be at least a few days of ouchies before my back gets back together. I just want to be able to sleep tonight.

				Acupuncture!&nbsp; The BEST one I have ever seen is on 31st st between 21st ave and Ditmars. (and I have been to many all around the country)<br />Moon Acupuncture 718-721-5450<br />I have had a similar re-occurring problem with my back.&nbsp; Dr. Moon has worked wonders.<br />FYI you will need to go more than once and the best is to go a couple times a week.&nbsp; They do take insurance there.<br /><br />Someone mentioned the doctor giving you muscle relaxers and that is true.&nbsp; While that does help the symptoms it is not going to help you for the long run.&nbsp; Once my back was so bad that I did take the relaxers and do Acu. at the same time.&nbsp; <br />I really can&#039;t say enough about Dr. Moon, get yourself there ASAP. <br /><br />I can&#039;t stop myself from posting this -<br />When you are feeling a bit better you can come see me for a massage.&nbsp; I specialize in injury rehab.&nbsp; (I would love to suggest myself first, but I think I know your kind of injury and while the massage will feel great, it isn&#039;t going to help as much as acupuncture is going to.)<br /><br />Melissa<br />918-873-0076&nbsp; :)
