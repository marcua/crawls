				I find it quite odd there are no adult private pickup games and leagues with all the schools nearby. My friend is looking if anyone has leads please let me know.

				I found a court with nets on 21st St between Ditmars and 21st Ave. It&#039;s full court, but not regulation size as the two hoops are too close to each other. But the rims are 10 feet high and straight, and they actually have nets, which is rare.<br /><br />Wouldnt be a great court for 5 on 5, but a 3 on 3 half court game would be great here. I shot around last weekend, and it was nice to get out there for a bit.<br /><br />Anyone know of anything better? If not take a look, and let me know if you&#039;d want to play there.<br /><br />

				Its true that there is a lack of any thing like a basketball league in A-town, but I suggest you check out the courts in Astoria Park, although not full regulation size, there is always a couple 4 on 4 half courts that are played. I frequent the courts as i live on 21st street. Check it out, always fun playing with the talents that play there too.&nbsp; :cool:

				The BQE gym which is called Ultimate Fitness has a full court basketball court which one can play in. Im not sure the admission price but members can play for free and the membership is dirt cheap (planetfitness prices ) .
