								<div class="inner" id="msg_31005">for you sadly taking your eye of baseball.<br />The playoffs are coming...<br /><br />***<br /><br />Four Dems Contending for Owens&#39; Crown in the `City of Kings&#39;<br />By Marie Horrigan<br />Sep. 06, 2006<br /><br />Four high-profile Democrats are running in the Sept. 12 primary to<br />succeed veteran New York Democratic Rep. Major R. Owens in<br />Brooklyn&#39;s 11th Congressional District. And they have set up a race<br />so tight that even local political insiders are loathe to predict a<br />winner.<br />State Sen. Carl Andrews, New York City Council members Yvette Clarke<br />and David Yassky, and political activist Chris Owens, the<br />congressman&#39;s son, are competing for a seat that could provide the<br />winner with lifetime job security.<br />The district, in which three-fifths of the residents are black and a<br />total of roughly four-fifths are minorities, is a Democratic<br />stronghold. Three out of four voters consider themselves Democrats:<br />Party presidential nominee John Kerry received 86 percent of the<br />district&#39;s vote in 2004, and incumbent Owens, in the last of his 12<br />House victories, took 94 percent and had no Republican opponent.<br />The four would-be successors in many ways reflect the diversity of<br />the district itself, which encompasses areas of Brooklyn including<br />middle- and working-class communities such as Crown Heights,<br />Flatbush and Brownsville, as well the increasingly &quot;gentrified&quot;<br />neighborhood of Park Slope:<br />• Yassky has drawn much attention, and perhaps caused the biggest<br />stir, as the only white candidate running for a seat that has had<br />African-American representation since it was claimed in the mid-<br />1960s by black political pioneer Shirley Chisholm. Despite criticism<br />from some black activists, Yassky pursues a liberal agenda that he<br />says should appeal to district voters regardless of race.<br />• Clarke&#39;s political heritage, after succeeding her mother, Una<br />Clarke, on the City Council, gives her deep ties within the<br />political community that supplement her voter base in her council<br />district. Clarke set the stage for this campaign by challenging the<br />elder Owens in the 2004 primary, holding the incumbent to a 45<br />percent to 29 percent edge in the four-candidate race.<br />• Andrews represents half of the congressional district in the state<br />Senate and is well-connected to top state Democrats, including<br />Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, the likely Democratic nominee and<br />general election favorite for governor.<br />• Chris Owens, a former campaign manager for his father, predicts<br />his background as a private-sector businessman, his political<br />activism, and district voters&#39; fondness for the incumbent will<br />propel him to the front of the pack next Tuesday.<br />&quot;You&#39;ve got the interaction of geography and demography. You&#39;ve got<br />three black candidates, you&#39;ve got overlapping districts ... and<br />you&#39;ve got the various institutional supports. It&#39;s very difficult<br />to figure out which way the vote&#39;s moving,&quot; political science<br />professor Doug Muzzio of Baruch College, a part of the City<br />University of New York, told CQPolitics.com.<br />The consensus among analysts, though not an overwhelming one, is<br />that if there is a top tier in the field, it is composed of Clarke<br />and Yassky.<br />Clarke differentiates herself as the only woman in the race. As the<br />daughter of Caribbean immigrants, she also connects with one of the<br />two major ethnic groups among black voters in the 11th District. She<br />succeeded her mother (who challenged Major Owens in the 2000 House<br />primary) in the 40th District City Council seat in 2001 and was re-<br />elected to the seat twice, the second time just last year.<br />Yassky, who last week picked up the endorsement of the New York<br />Times, is by far the best-funded of the candidates. According to the<br />candidates&#39; pre-primary filings with the Federal Election<br />Commission, Yassky had $360,000 in cash on hand as of Aug. 23 out of<br />$1.4 million raised. Andrews raised the second-most money with<br />$543,000 in total receipts, but heavy spending left him last in cash<br />reserves with $32,000. Clarke had $76,000 left in her coffers out of<br />$398,000 raised, and Owens had $64,000 out of $351,000 raised.<br />&quot;He&#39;s the Bloomberg of the race in terms of money,&quot; former New York<br />City Councilman Kenneth Fisher said of Yassky, comparing his<br />campaign to the big-spending blowouts by Republican Michael<br />Bloomberg in his successful 2001 and 2005 bids for mayor of New York.<br />But, Fisher continued, &quot;If demographics is destiny, Yassky needs to<br />win a good-sized majority of the white vote and a respectable<br />percentage of the black vote in order to be able to win. And it&#39;s<br />not clear to me whether he has closed the sale in either of those<br />categories.&quot;<br />Clarke, meanwhile, is one of several critics who charge that<br />Yassky&#39;s decision to run in the 11th — he moved into the district,<br />although he already represented part of it in the city council — was<br />an opportunistic move in which Yassky hoped to take advantage of the<br />three-way split among the primary&#39;s black candidates.<br />&quot;I&#39;ve said before that I thought it was a racial calculation, and I<br />stand by that statement,&quot; Clarke said in an e-mailed statement to<br />CQPolitics.com. &quot;To pick up and move to a district where there were,<br />at the time, four candidates of color running against one another —<br />I don&#39;t see any other way to look at it, considering his council<br />district is just about evenly divided between three congressional<br />districts.&quot;<br />Yassky and Clarke, though viewed by some as the possible front-<br />runners entering the home stretch, may be hindered by recent<br />developments. Yassky, who has been portrayed by his opponents as too<br />cozy with developers, last week canceled a fundraiser with architect<br />Robert Scarano Jr., whose large-scale designs for buildings in<br />Brooklyn have caused controversies.<br />The Yassky campaign has dismissed the flap, saying simply that the<br />event was cancelled after it was determined to be<br />inappropriate. &quot;You know a race is being examined under a microscope<br />when a scheduling mistake makes the newspapers,&quot; Yassky spokesman<br />Evan Thies told CQPolitics.com.<br />Clarke, meanwhile, faces the re-emergence of reports that in recent<br />campaigns she inflated her fundraising numbers as well her<br />educational credentials, implying she graduated from Oberlin College<br />in Ohio when she did not.<br />The other two candidates contend they are not out of the running.<br />Owens said that although his campaign trails in fundraising, voters<br />respond enthusiastically once they get the chance to meet him.<br />Voters find meeting him &quot;quite exciting, because they do have a lot<br />of respect and love for my father, and they&#39;re excited by the fact<br />that I&#39;m running,&quot; he told CQPolitics.com.<br />Owens argues his own experience in the private sector gives him a<br />leg up over the competition in terms of understanding how to serve<br />voters. &quot;We talk about how we deliver on better customer service or<br />constituents, when we talk about some of our plans in the business<br />world and how government impacts on small businesses, I speak with<br />the experience that my opponents cannot,&quot; he said.<br />Andrews, who the New York Times slammed in its editorial endorsing<br />Yassky as too close to the Democratic political machine, dismissed<br />the label as a typecast. He cited his experience in the state Senate<br />and in helping run Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton&#39;s Senate campaign<br />in 2000 and Spitzer&#39;s re-election campaign for attorney general in<br />2004 — all of which, he said, have given him an understanding of<br />reaching out to voters and also across the aisle.<br />&quot;I have a proud record of working in the Democratic Party getting<br />Democrats elected and all those individuals came to me to be a part<br />of their campaign ... so I think that those endorsements of support<br />from those individuals speak for themselves,&quot; he told CQPolitics.com.<br />Muzzio stated, though, that recent stumbles could place all the<br />candidates on the defensive. &quot;It may be rather than who&#39;s going to<br />win the race, it&#39;s who&#39;s not going to lose it,&quot; he said.<br />The New York Working Families Party, which often endorses Democratic<br />Party candidates, has not yet done so in the 11th District race.<br />Attorney and community activist Elon Harpaz is running unopposed on<br />the party&#39;s line Sept. 12, though party officials have been known to<br />ask their nominee to step aside after a primary in lieu of the<br />Democratic Party&#39;s nominee.<br />Stephen Finger, a medical doctor and self-described libertarian, is<br />running on the Republican line. Marianne Blume, an outspoken state<br />Republican Party committeewoman is running for the Conservative<br />Party line; she did the same in the neighboring 10th District two<br />years ago, taking 1 percent of the vote in a contest dominated by<br />Democratic incumbent Edolphus Towns.<br />CQ rates the general election race as Safe Democratic.

								<div class="inner" id="msg_31020">I&#39;ve been following this race very closely, and even helped moderate a forum for it this month. Again, it&#39;s similar to the AG race, four good candidates.&nbsp; That being said, I have a strong preference in this race, and it&#39;s Yvette Clarke.&nbsp; We need more women in Congress and the candidates have almost identical positions on all issues.&nbsp; <br /><br />Major Owens, while a very nice man, and one who had good politics, did absolutely nothing of note in his many years in Congress, hardly a fitting legacy for the seat held by Shirley Chisolm.&nbsp; His son has the best politics in my opinion, he&#39;s a true progressive on all issues and is charming, but I fear he would be a repeat of the father and his continuing insistence that development issues can be addressed by a Congressmember makes me think he doesn&#39;t appreciate the areas of focus between local, state and federal levels of government.&nbsp; <br /><br />David Yassky did great things in the Council and he would be a great addition to Congress, but to run in this district smacks of political opportunism of the worst kind and I think it&#39;s wrong for him to run in this seat.&nbsp; If elected, he would probably only hold the seat for one or two terms before an African-American consensus candidate emerged and knocked him out of office.&nbsp; <br /><br />Carl Andrews is one of the nicest men around and he knows government inside and out.&nbsp; He would also be a good Congressmember.&nbsp; His years of work in the district and his connections in city and state government would allow him to access great resources for the district.&nbsp; He&#39;s been a good State Senator and his connections to Eliot Spitzer would serve him well.<br /><br />I support Yvette because all things being equal, the fact that she is a women and the child of immigrants, she will bring greater diversity to Congress and she is able to bring people from all backgrounds together.&nbsp; Her record in the City Council is strong - she fought hard to bring greater diversity to the Fire Department and to ensure equal treatment for women.</div>
