				I&#39;m looking for a new couch.&nbsp; I&#39;d like a small sectional, and I am willing to pay for quality (though nothing super designer.&nbsp; I want to pay for quality, not fashion).<br /><br />It doesn&#39;t have to be Astoria.&nbsp; I have a car and am willing to travel...even to LI or NJ or CT.&nbsp; <br /><br />Any thoughts?<br /><br />Thanks so much!

				We got one couch from Ikea- Sofa bed I think I paid $600 for it- but that was 7 years ago. I think they are still relatively reasonable. I bought it at the Ikea in Elizabeth NJ because they have lower sales tax. It is still in good condition and the delivery price was $69. My other sofa I bought at Levitz in Ridgewood Queens. I think that was about $600 was well. I love this sofa- its very comfy and stain resistant (scotch guarded). I don&#39;t remember the delivery charge price- but I don&#39;t think it was very high.<br /><br />I haven&#39;t found much luck in Astoria with furniture stores. Gothic cabinet on Steinway has nice wood furniture- but I think they are a bit pricey and they don&#39;t sell sofa&#39;s.

				Not sure what your preferred style is, but for modern designer-like without the designer prices check out Design Within Reach. &nbsp;I like the Libre sectional collection for a high-end designer look with the mix &amp; match options that can easily suit a smaller space. &nbsp;We have a dining table and small end table from them. &nbsp;Quality is very nice and there is a showroom on 14th street (West Side) if you want to see the pieces in person. &nbsp;<br /><br />http://www.dwr.com/category.cfm?start=31&amp;category=1&amp;subc=46 (http://www.dwr.com/category.cfm?start=31&amp;category=1&amp;subc=46)<br /><br />Ethan Allen also has a small line of what they call &#39;apartment sized&#39; pieces. &nbsp;We had 2 sofas from them, not sectional, that were also very nice quality and fit well in an apartment - 72&quot; wide. &nbsp;We purchased from the store on Northern Boulevard in Manhasset http://www.ethanallen.com/ea/com.ethanallen.ecom.StoreInfoServlet?store_id=09020269 (http://www.ethanallen.com/ea/com.ethanallen.ecom.StoreInfoServlet?store_id=09020269)<br /><br />

				I did a little research on this topic.&nbsp; Make sure the wood frame is &quot;kiln-dried&quot;.&nbsp; This means it won&#39;t warp - an indicator of a good-quality couch, usually.&nbsp; Pottery Barn has very good quality stuff.&nbsp; I have a Pottery Barn couch and did a lot of shopping around for quality.&nbsp; The only problem is that even a drip of water makes a mark on the fabric that I selected - very annoying!&nbsp; A lot of IKEA&#39;s stuff, while cute, is not good-quality.&nbsp; Their wood is not kiln-dried (last time I checked) and they use cheap foam for cushions that can flatten after a while.&nbsp; All-down cushions can also completely flatten and look pretty sad after a while.&nbsp; Supposedly the best kind of cushion is one with a medium-density core that is surrounded in down.&nbsp; Hope these suggestions help!<br /><br />Jenny

				I have had my couch from Ikea for six years and haven&#39;t had any problems. In fact it is a sofa bed and I have been told on more than one occasion that it is one of the most comfortable couches that my guest have ever slept on. Maybe I lucked out.

				Thanks all for the recommendations.&nbsp; I was at a Jennifer Convertible today, and I found a couch that I really like.&nbsp; It&#39;s a 2 piece sectional with a full-size pull out bed and chais lounge.&nbsp; Seems really nice, but I am nervous about the quality.&nbsp; Nothing that I noticed seemed troubling, but any time a store is as big a chain as Jennifer I think twice.&nbsp; Anyone have any thoughts on this company?<br /><br />As for what I&#39;m seeking, fashion is my lowest priority.&nbsp; I want comfy-ness and quality first and foremost.&nbsp; I think a sectional (small) is my only real option with the small hallways in my apt.<br /><br />Thanks again for all the help!<br /><br />adam

I do, however, have another thought on the subject of couch buying. I&#39;ve had a total of 5 couches in my lifetime. I made 4 terrible mistakes. I bought for comfort and space constraints. Unless you plan on spending at least a decade in your present situation, buy only for comfort. If it is too big for the room now, it will fit fine in the next place. One other thing, furniture is one of those commodities that holds true for the old adage: You need to spend more to get more. Real quality costs.

				Your couch was delightful, Telly.&nbsp; It was a most welcome buttock-resting place after hell-like temperatures and a sudden downpour.&nbsp; It&#39;s a perfect size, both length and width-wise, a gorgeous white color, lovely fluffy side pillows, and sat three of us very comfortably.&nbsp; Four would even be able to sit comfortably.&nbsp; Good material - not scratchy, not too heavy, and of course you can&#39;t stick to it.&nbsp; And it&#39;s elegant-looking.&nbsp; Not girly, but not overly masculine.&nbsp; Well-balanced, really.&nbsp; <br /><br />Yeah, I&#39;d give Telesphoros&#39; couch an A.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-D

				Another idea:<br /><br />Don&#39;t know how you would feel about a &quot;used&quot; couch, but sometimes Craig&#39;s List will have an unusual offer where a couch is practically brand new and from an excellent store.&nbsp; It&#39;s a great way to get higher-end stuff at a reasonable price.&nbsp; Obviously there is a lot of crap on there, it&#39;s a bit of a treasure hunt, but it might be fun just to take a look.

One, it&#39;s white. Two, if you are small/short or have any kind of claustrophobia issues it may not be for you, the large floating back pillows tend to envelop you when you sit down ... otherwise though, a fine looking, comfy couch and generally a happy bottom after an evening sitting on it. ;)

				You might try Crate and Barrel, especially when they have furniture sales.&nbsp; I bought a sofa from them a few years ago, and I recall it was about $800 on sale.&nbsp; It&#39;s a very nice and roomy (84&quot;) sofa - not a sleeper, but we&#39;ve put up individual guests on it.&nbsp; It&#39;s actually one of our nicer pieces of furniture.

				Thank you all so much for the replies!&nbsp; I ended up going with JC.&nbsp; After visiting roughly 10 stores, I never found anything that I liked as much as the JC one.&nbsp; It&#39;s a microfiber sectional sleeper.&nbsp; Now my two biggest problems are waiting 6-8 weeks and getting my current old couch out of here.&nbsp; Oh, and because I went for a larger couch, I think I&#39;m going to have to get rid of my very favorite recliner.&nbsp; Now, that&#39;s sad.<br /><br />Thanks again!

				i was going to tell you not to go with JC mostly for the outragous wait and delivery fees. also my 6-8 weeks turned into 12. the piece of crap wasn&#39;t even worth the wait. i think the showroom model was beefed up, because the one i got was painful. i now only have the love seat as i lost the couch in the divorce. then he lost it because he was evicted. <br />i did a dance of joy when the bastards on steinway burned down.<br /><br />and never ever buy a used couch.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;BED BUGS
