			Guidelines for Real Estate Listings<br /><br />Astorians.com is an interactive forum and as such, will feature a fair amount of give and take on the listings posted here.&nbsp; Be prepared to get comments and questions on your listings and engage with our readers.&nbsp; Please respond to all comments in a timely manner.<br /><br />Avoid using ALL CAPS in your title or listing.&nbsp; It is bad internet etiquette and is equivalent to shouting at your potential customers.<br /><br />This website concerns all things Astoria.&nbsp; We accept listings for all areas but the emphasis is on Astoria.&nbsp; Please be upfront about the location of your property.<br /><br />List the location and price of the property.&nbsp; It is the most common question you will get, and it will save everyone time, if you get it out of the way first off the bat.<br /><br />Please keep all posts related to the same property in the same thread.&nbsp; Even if the date for the open house has changed.&nbsp; Do not post duplicates - they will be removed.<br /><br />List your contact information or ask posters to contact you via personal message (PM).<br /><br />General note:<br /><br />Broker&#039;s listings are entirely welcome on Astorians.com and we try to foster non-confrontational dialogue.&nbsp; &nbsp;The advertising section serves this community and negativity can really discourage businesses from posting in an unwelcome atmosphere.&nbsp; That being said, this is an interactive forum and questions and comments are to be expected.&nbsp; Please remember if you have a problem or a question regarding an ad, you can always respond with a modicum of respect, and/or email/message the poster directly.&nbsp; Problems can also be reported to the moderators.<br /><br />Thank you.
