				At what time is it appropriate to call the police on a party in the hallway?&nbsp; It&#39;s damn near 1:30 in the morning, and while I realize it&#39;s Saturday night (well, Sunday technically), I&#39;ve had just about enough.&nbsp; There is insanely loud music (with the same bass line over and over, every song), about 15 teenagers in the hallway hollering, a few outside the building hollering, and I&#39;m two seconds away from flinging myself out the window.&nbsp; I&#39;m thinking if they&#39;re not quiet by two, I&#39;m calling the cops.&nbsp; &nbsp;:x<br /><br />I have stopped watching &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; because I quite literally can&#39;t hear it over the hullabaloo.&nbsp; Which sucks because I haven&#39;t seen this movie in ages and I love it.&nbsp; Will this noise ever stop? &quot;I don&#39;t know.... it&#39;s a mystery.&quot;&nbsp; I modified the post to add this.&nbsp; That&#39;s how intensely I&#39;m feeling this.&nbsp; Oh good, now they&#39;re screaming for someone to open the door.&nbsp; How nice.&nbsp; I&#39;m two seconds away from unleashing my rendition of &quot;The Highlights from Phantom of the Opera.&quot;&nbsp; And don&#39;t nobody want that!!!&nbsp; I am very much NOT Sarah Brightman......I might have to hit the vodka.&nbsp; If I pass out, I won&#39;t hear the racket and I won&#39;t have to ponder calling the cops.&nbsp; Since I live here, I&#39;m concerned about ramifications if they know I was the one who called.&nbsp; I might need to have a revenge party this weekend.&nbsp; Good grief.&nbsp; This is rich; they&#39;re shushing each other.&nbsp; What&#39;s more annoying?&nbsp; I can&#39;t decide.&nbsp; They are sooooo&nbsp; lucky I&#39;m an insomniac who does not have to get up early tomorrow.&nbsp;

				I don&#39;t know, but that&#39;s a great question.&nbsp; I believe I read somewhere that 10 PM was the cut off between what the police will respond to or not (I have no idea the source or if that&#39;s correct).&nbsp; Of course, your building and lease may indicate something different.&nbsp; Our says...&quot;no noise that can be heard in another apartment at anytime&quot;.&nbsp; However I think that&#39;s more of a backup should management want to evict someone than actually enofrced or enforceable.&nbsp; I&#39;m curious what other people&#39;s experiences have been as well as to what distinction is made with noise coming from another tenant vs a bar/club with outdoor patios.

				Ouch.&nbsp; Sorry to hear about this.&nbsp; You should talk with your landlord and maybe slip a note to the party thrower apartment explaining how problematic it was.&nbsp; They should be much more considerate of their neighbors.&nbsp; What time did it end up?

				An excellent idea, mcdirk, except that my neighbors don&#39;t speak any English.&nbsp; It&#39;s funny; they&#39;re an elderly couple with grandchildren coming in and out of the apartment at all hours.&nbsp; I have to believe that they weren&#39;t home.&nbsp; It&#39;s done now and I&#39;m over it, but if it happens again I will take it up with the landlord (and the police if need be. There was underage drinking and the smoking of something that was definitely not cigarettes).&nbsp; It was out of control.&nbsp; Around two-thirty I remembered I had earplugs and I was so darned tired that I ended up falling asleep with only a faint pounding coming from next door.&nbsp; Probably didn&#39;t go on too much longer than that.&nbsp;

				During the week, I usually go with the ten o&#39;clock quiet rule. On the weekends its a little rougher, but I think between 12-1 is appropriate to expect people to start quieting down. I&#39;ve been guilty of loud music past one, but like anyone, will usually push the limits until someone complains...if you don&#39;t complain, no one will know you are bothered...squeaky wheel syndrome.

				I think you&#39;re all right, and if it does happen again past midnight and particularly in as obnoxious a fashion as last Sunday, I will not hesitate to call the police.&nbsp; I&#39;m actually really surprised no one else in my building complained.&nbsp; Most of the residents in my &quot;cell block&quot; have really young children.&nbsp; If I&#39;d put my child to bed only to have him or her wrenched from sleep at ten PM by unrelenting racket, I would be livid.&nbsp; Even my kitty cat hid under the bed for most of that four-hour period, and she usually enjoys loud noises.&nbsp; Anyway, I&#39;m glad to know it wouldn&#39;t be uncalled for to alert the cops.&nbsp; Thanks for the advice, everyone.<br /><br />Oh yeah, love your quote, Alexa.&nbsp; <em>Scrubs</em> is the second best TV comedy every made (<em>Frasier</em> being first).&nbsp; &nbsp;:mrgreen:

				I would definitely call the police past 10.&nbsp; How annoying!&nbsp; Where are there parents?!&nbsp; I always find myself wondering that.&nbsp; There are so many unruly children and teenagers these days.&nbsp; My block itself is very noisy.&nbsp; Sometimes it&#39;s just people walking down the block talking really loudly.&nbsp; It&#39;s quite annoying.&nbsp;
