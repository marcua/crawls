				Starting a catch all thread for the next year to post things that make me chuckle about politics. I hope others will join me. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />What I learned today. <br /><br /><br />Ann Coulter is not a fan of the French Revolution (She compared it to OWS). <br /><br /><br />Herman Cain is leading in a poll (You GOPers really hate Romney). <br /><br /><br />Mitch McConnell is the actual leader of the Senate - Think about it...nothing can even be debated without his approval. <br /><br /><br />ALL REGULATIONS ARE BAD....oh and they are job killers. I guess that includes the regulations covering coal mines. In 1907,&nbsp; 3242 miners died.....in 1910, Congress creates the Mine Safety and Health Administration. Since then, deaths have fallen to 33 in 2007. Cause and effect anyone????????<br /><br /><br />Oh, and I dare you to goggle Santorum.

				ahhhh....this gave me warm feelings of joy.....From George Wills latest Column.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana;" class="bbc_font"><span style="font-size: 13px;" class="bbc_size">Republicans may have found their Michael Dukakis, a technocratic Massachusetts governor who takes his bearings from “data” (although there is precious little to support Romney’s idea that in-state college tuition for children of illegal immigrants is a powerful magnet for such immigrants) and who believes elections should be about (in Dukakis’s words) “competence,” not “ideology.” But what would President Romney competently do when not pondering ethanol subsidies that he forthrightly says should stop sometime before “forever”? Has conservatism come so far, surmounting so many obstacles, to settle, at a moment of economic crisis, for <em>this</em>?</span></span>
