				I need to focus right.<br /><br />Well the Yankees may need to get off the West Coast as soon as possible.<br />Please note any highlights.<br /><br />One thing that is great and horrible about&nbsp; baseball is how humbling it is.<br />(Unless you are Barry Bonds.)<br /><br />And, Rollins was awesome. What a streak.<br /><br />(My fantasy also lives and dies by the Yanks. Nice opening day and tough since then.)<br /><br />Baseball is baseball. I want to hear from Mets fans too. You are lucky you got a good manager now. Not that he does any pitching or hitting or defense. And what a GM.<br />***<br />NYC (Astoria) is alot like a restaurant mentioned by a great philosopher.<br /><br />&quot;Nobody goes there anymore, it is too crowded.&quot;<br />

				Last night were some late inning games.<br />Baseball is like that sometimes. Painful.<br /><br />But then you get up, dust off your uniform. <br /><br />There is another game. You cant undo the past.<br />You can be ready&nbsp; now&nbsp; for the next at bat, the next pitch, the next ground ball.

				I recently read an <strong>article</strong> (http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&amp;c=Article&amp;pubid=968163964505&amp;cid=1146174636780&amp;col=1053692575155&amp;call_page=TSS_Main&amp;call_pageid=968867503640&amp;call_p) about an ambidextrous pitcher from Nebraska, Pat Venditte.&nbsp; He&#39;s not quite in the major leages, but is an active switch <em>pitcher</em> playing Division 1 and is one of the few ambidextrous pitchers in the history of the sport.&nbsp; His ERA is 2.36 as a righty and 2.92 as a lefty.&nbsp; He has a glove specially made in Japan with two thumbholes!&nbsp; His fast balls are in the 80+ mph.&nbsp; Pretty cool talent, if you ask me.&nbsp; It will be interesting to see where he goes with the sport.

				Hey, anybody up for getting a group together to go see a Brooklyn Cyclones game?&nbsp; Added bonus:&nbsp; getting a hot dog at Nathan&#39;s before the game.&nbsp; Second added bonus:&nbsp; It&#39;s a long ride, but the N train&#39;s right there.&nbsp; End to end, baby.<br /><br />Here&#39;s (http://brooklyncyclones.com/tickets/schedule/) the schedule.&nbsp; It&#39;s even more fun if they&#39;re playing the Staten Island Yankees.

				First Mets game at Shea last night.&nbsp; Mets won it in the 9th!&nbsp; And to top it off, as the stadium emptied, the crowd broke out in a chant of &quot;Yankees suck.&nbsp; Yankees suck.&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />Fabulous :-D
