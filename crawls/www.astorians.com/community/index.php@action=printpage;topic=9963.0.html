				Hello,<br /><br />This is probably old news to all of you who actually pay attention to your taxes, but I just wanted to share the IRS Economic Stimulus Payment calculator for people like me.<br /><br />http://www.irs.gov/app/espc/<br /><br />Easy as one, two, three, unless you are me, who repeatedly decides to put commas between the numbers.&nbsp; Use whole dollar amounts and no commas (1,000 = 1000)!<br /><br />After doing the calculation, they give you an estimate, but with the warning that if you owe any back taxes it will be taken out.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				I just wanted to add the payment schedule.&nbsp; The breakdown illustrates why it&#039;s probably good to do direct deposit!&nbsp; I cut and pasted the schedule and here&#039;s the link.<br /><br />http://www.irs.gov/irs/article/0,,id=180250,00.html<br /><br />DIRECT DEPOSIT<br /><br />Last two SSN digits: Payment will be transmitted: <br />&nbsp;00 through 20&nbsp; May 2 <br />&nbsp;21 through 75&nbsp; May 9 <br />&nbsp;76 through 99&nbsp; May 16 <br />&nbsp;<br />PAPER CHECK<br /><br />&nbsp;Last two SSN digits:&nbsp; Payments will be mailed by: <br />&nbsp;00 through 09&nbsp; May 16 <br />&nbsp;10 through 18&nbsp; May 23 <br />&nbsp;19 through 25<br />&nbsp; May 30 <br />&nbsp;26 through 38&nbsp; June 6 <br />&nbsp;39 through 51&nbsp; June 13 <br />&nbsp;52 through 63&nbsp; June 20 <br />&nbsp;64 through 75&nbsp; June 27 <br />&nbsp;76 through 87&nbsp; July 4 <br />&nbsp;88 through 99&nbsp; July 11 <br /><br />People who file a return after April 15 will receive their economic stimulus payment, but probably about two weeks later than the schedule shows. A return must be filed by October 15 in order to receive a stimulus payment this year. See the online calculator for an estimate of the amount you will receive. <br /><br />A small percentage of tax returns will require additional time to process and to compute a stimulus payment amount. For these returns, stimulus payments may not be issued in accordance with the schedule above, even if the tax return was processed by April 15.<br /><br />Related Item: IR-2008-44, IRS Announces Economic Stimulus Payment Schedules, Provides Online Payment Calculator<br /><br />

Is my Stimulus Payment taxable?<br /><br />&nbsp;A. No. You will not owe tax on your payment when you file your 2008 federal income tax return. But you should keep a copy of the IRS letter you receive later this year listing the amount of your payment. In the event you do not qualify for the full amount this year but you do next year, you will need to have the letter as a record of the amount you previously received.<br /><br />Q. Will the payment I receive in 2008 reduce my 2008 refund or increase the amount I owe for 2008?<br /><br />A. No, the Stimulus Payment will not reduce your refund or increase the amount you owe when you file your 2008 return.</strong><br /><br />The economic will be added to the budget deficit and federal budget, according to this article from the US News and World Report:<br />http://www.usnews.com/articles/business/economy/2008/01/28/economic-stimulus-how-it-works-or-fails.html

				If you would like to know when you will be getting your ESP check, you can check the schedule here:<br /><br />http://www.irs.gov/irs/article/0,,id=180250,00.html<br /><br />It is based on the last two digits of your SSN and whether or not you are doing direct deposit or mailed-check.
