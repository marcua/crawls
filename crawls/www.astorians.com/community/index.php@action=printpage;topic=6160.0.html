				Hello Everyone!!<br /><br />I hope that you all can give me some insight. I am looking to move six months from now and I am thinking of Astoria and Brooklyn. I currently live a few blocks from Queens Center Mall, and I love it where I am, however its time for me to fly the coup. I live with others currently. <br /><br />I am looking for an area or areas in Astoria where it is child friendly (8 year old daughter), diverse, near playgrounds/parks, close to schools, supermarkets etc. I don&#039;t need to be 2-3 blocks close the subway. I am currently 10 blocks from the train and its great, therefore farther away from the subway is not a problem. I need the V/R or N/W to get to work. <br /><br />I will be going to visit different parts of Astoria, however I need some guidance on where to start. Any help or insight would be great. <br /><br />In terms of living...I would like to live in an apartment, no private houses. <br /><br />Thanks so much for this!! <br /><br />Mae :-)

				Hello Mae,<br /><br />I have lived in Astoria for over 15 years and I think it is one of the best neighborhoods in NYC. I think that of all the areas here the most convenient, safest and least congested is the Ditmars Blvd.\31st street area (also known as Upper Ditmars area). It is the last stop on the N\W in Astoria, has some of the best schools, shopping, restaurants, parks, lounges, bars, shops and some the most interstesting people. It is very child friendly and their are plenty of apartments for rent. There are a a lot of 3 family homes and small apartment buildings however, you have to act fast because it is an area that people snatch up apartments very quickly. <br /><br />Let me know if you need some more help and I would be glad to direct you. Good luck neighbor!<br /><br />Best,<br />Clliff<br />(maxdeca2@aol.com)
