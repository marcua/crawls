				Ok, I know this sounds a little weird, with Freeze Peach and all, but I guess my first question is do you guys sell bean coffee?<br /><br />If not -- have you/would you consider doing so?<br /><br />If I'm out of options on the above two, where can I get good quality bean coffee in Astoria? &nbsp;Not St*r$$, not supermarket. &nbsp;Good stuff, preferably fair trade and/or organic.<br /><br />The store I've been buying from for years is in Park Slope, and I'd love to find something more convenient.

				I don't know of anything in Astoria, so this might not be immensely helpful, but Porto Rico Coffee Company sells great whole-bean coffee. &nbsp;They have a good selection of very tasty organic, fair-trade beans (which I also buy) at a decent price. &nbsp;The selection is not huge, but the variety is good, and I have been extremely pleased thus far. &nbsp;Also (given that I know you like espresso &nbsp; 8) &nbsp;) they have a great organic, fair trade Mexican espresso.<br /><br />They have two stores that I know of: one in the East Village on St. Marks btw. 1st and 2nd; the other on Bleecker by 6th Ave.<br /><br />carse

				We are planning on selling loose beans at the Peach sometime in the near future. Probably in the next few weeks. That will be one possible option for you.

				There are whole beans at the supermarket - I always forget which is which as far as names go but... the one on 28th ave and 41st. &nbsp;There are also whole beans for sale at a few of the middle eastern shops around - the one on Steinway just north of 28th has it. &nbsp; If you ask them nicely they might even throw in some cardamon with the beans. <br /><br />&nbsp;:lol:
