			Hi everyone,<br /><br />Random question here, but I thought the community might have some recommendations to share. Do you have any dental insurance that you like? I&#039;m self-employed and will be purchasing some in the near future. I&#039;ve got a great dentist right here in Astoria that I like thanks to your recommendations (Dr Takos), and I want to get moving on getting insurance so I can set up an appointment in the fall. Thanks!<br /><br /><br /><br />
