				I live in the Ditmars area and would like to know if anyone has suggestions for a good seafood restaurant that has good food as well as a nice quiet atmosphere.

				That place doesn&#039;t have a quiet atmosphere at all.&nbsp; It&#039;s noisy and crowded.&nbsp; Atmosphere is important to me.&nbsp; I like a nice relaxed quiet atmosphere maybe with some nice soft music

				Sorry you&#039;re right. How about Okeanos? Should be quiet there.

				Give it a shot! Especially if your friend says it&#039;s good.&nbsp; Sometimes just like movies they get bad reviews from critics and then when you see it for yourself you&#039;re like this movie was pretty good!

				I would avoid Okeanos at all costs. I gave it a try despite wondering why it was always empty,<br />My Rare steak came out Well Done, I can understand if they slipped up and gave me Medium Rare or even Medium, but Well Done when asking for it rare?<br /><br />Also I felt it was really overpriced. Beware the M.P. for the fish, I think it was a snapper or something similar, I got charged $35 for it. True it&#039;s my fault for not asking what the price that day was, I didn&#039;t think it would&#039;ve been that high. And the food was not that great either.<br /><br />I would suggest Elias Corner instead<br />

				I&#039;m not a fan of Kyklades at all.&nbsp; Mainly the whole &quot;tourist trap&quot; thing they have going on.&nbsp; I am a fan of Okeanos.&nbsp; ATB24, I agree about the prices but I think I went by recently and saw they revamped the menu and are a little more down to earth now.&nbsp; I could be wrong.&nbsp; I also think they&#039;re great with fish but maybe don&#039;t know how to cook a steak.&nbsp; We&#039;ve been many times and loved it.&nbsp; They do an amazing seafood chowder.&nbsp; The fish is always fresh and prepared beautifully.&nbsp; Vegetables and sides are also very good - like surprisingly good.&nbsp; Atmosphere is decent and they have a full bar.&nbsp; Another option not too terribly far from Ditmars (on 28th near Rapture) is Off the Hook.&nbsp; Delicious.&nbsp; Love that place.&nbsp; A slightly more nightlife-ish vibe depending on the time you go, but nice place and delicious food.&nbsp; Elias Corner is a good choice in terms of very fresh seafood.&nbsp; But the atmosphere is old and beat up a bit.&nbsp; The servers are famously grumpy.&nbsp; There isn&#039;t really a menu and prices are relative to the fish ordered so things can be a surprise when the bill comes unless you ask everything up front, which their waitresses will love.&nbsp; Consider Telly&#039;s on 23rd Avenue.&nbsp; They just remodeled very nicely and even added a bar.&nbsp; The only draw back is it attracts a lot of extended families.&nbsp; The servers can get easily overwhelmed and you can feel forgotten.&nbsp; If it&#039;s a good day, you can have a wonderful time there and a very delicious meal.&nbsp; I have to mention it because it&#039;s really my favorite seafood place in Astoria but far from Ditmars.&nbsp; It&#039;s Psari on 36th Avenue.&nbsp; Great raw bar and always amazing whole fish and shelf fish options.&nbsp; Atmosphere is upscale/casual if that makes sense.&nbsp; The only thing is that it can be tight when crowded and maybe a little noisy but never that bad.

				I&#039;ve been to Okeanos a handful of times and I thought it was pretty great. (Odd how they never have a crowd in there and manage to stay open.) You won&#039;t know until you try it yourself!

				<br />I too have wondered why Okeanos is empty and then I saw all the bad Yelp reviews.<br /><br />As for Kyclades, I tend to do the opposite of what the&nbsp; &#039;masses&#039; do.&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp; Therefore,&nbsp; because Kyclades is apparently so&nbsp; &#039;popular&#039;,&nbsp; &nbsp;I refuse to go.&nbsp; Also because there are WAY too many good restaurants in this city, to wait in a long line.<br /><br />My go-to Greek place is Gregory 26 Taverna on 23rd Ave near 26th Street.&nbsp; While&nbsp; I myself have never had their &#039;fish fish&#039;, it looks really great.&nbsp; I have had their grilled octopus...a lot...and it is excellent.

				I want to try that Gregory 26 Taverna one day.&nbsp; I decided to go to Okeanos.&nbsp; My friend loves it and said the food is good.&nbsp; I think I&#039;l get the flounder stuffed with crabmeat

				Flounder with crabmeat stuffing is something I order often.&nbsp; This dish is very well done at Okeanos.&nbsp; You will not be disappointed.&nbsp; But there was mention of Gregory 26 Taverna.&nbsp; Their crabmeat stuffing is truly extraordinary.&nbsp; You have to try it to understand.&nbsp; As for Okeanos, I think they do a poor job at boosting their own image.&nbsp; Maybe online, Facebook, events, food specials, showing up more in Boro magazine, street fairs, etc.&nbsp; I think the owner is a bit standoffish and doesn&#039;t bother much with marketing.&nbsp; They have a full bar with a lot of stools.&nbsp; If they played some upbeat music and made better use of lighting, people might be more inclined to go have a few drinks on a Fri/Sat night.&nbsp; Their food is very good.&nbsp; The service is very attentive and pleasant.&nbsp; There&#039;s so much potential.&nbsp; It&#039;s a shame.&nbsp; But I think most people who dare to try it are really glad they did.

				I went to Okeanos Saturday night and was very happy with the restaurant.&nbsp; I loved the atmosphere and they also had some nice Greek music playing in the background.&nbsp; I got the flounder stuffed with crabmeat and liked it a lot.&nbsp; It came with vegetables and lemon potatoes.&nbsp; The service was also very good.&nbsp; I would recommend this restaurant. If you dont&#039; want to spend too much you could go for the lunch special
