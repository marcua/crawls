				Am tempted, but am just too damned self-conscious. If you can convince me I might give in, though.<br /><br />Are you just taking pictures of individuals or are you also interested in taking pictures of couples or groups?

				Oh okay.. At first I thought it came right out of the camera.. I thought you might have used a filter or something.. I am a purist too.. I try a few things in PS but not a big fan of it..

				selective photoshop post-production work for professional retouching can work wonders.&nbsp; a little unsharp-masking, hint of curves/levels, maybe a bit of smoothing of the skin, remove a streetlamp... and you can get pretty decent results.<br /><br />i agree that the less amount of work you have to do post-shooting, the better.&nbsp; unfortunately lots of times great lighting and exposure aren&#39;t the easiest to achieve on the go, out on the street (at least on the front-end).
