				Hello to Out Astoria members.&nbsp; My name is Van.&nbsp; I have lived in Astoria, near Bohemian Hall for 7 years. I really love the area. It is a nice respite from the city.<br /><br />I am new to the Out Astoria group; I actually found out about it through a friend who lives on the Upper West Side.<br /><br />I am a media market researcher; I conduct audience studies for TV networks. Ever wondered why a character dropped off a show?&nbsp; Ever wondered why your favorite show is rated highly, or on the other hand, why the show suddenly vanishes? I have both the fortunate and unfortunate answers!!<br /><br />My most interesting study was one on the lesbian teen character, Bianca, on “All My Children.” I have also conducted studies for Nickelodeon, NBC (did one study of college students’ reactions to&nbsp; “Will &amp; Grace”), ESPN (&quot;The Jim Rome Show&quot;), Lifetime, and CBS. <br /><br />I attended college at the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana, which is 2 hrs south of Chicago. I paid my way through school by teaching classes and managing bands.&nbsp; I obtained my Ph.D. in 1988. I am 49 years old.<br /><br />I am also a writer.&nbsp; I have published several books, including a book about the ways in which Andy Warhol influenced singers/musicians such as David Bowie, Lou Reed, New York Dolls,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Roxy Music, and subsequently how Warhol influenced punk.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have been a fan of rock and roll/popular music since I was a kid. Some of my favorite bands/singers are The Velvet Underground, David Bowie, Lou Reed, The Ramones, early Elvis Presley, early Blondie, Television, Iggy Pop, REM, Nirvana, Black Flag/Henry Rollins, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Nick Cave, Sonic Youth, Peter Bjorn and John, The Smiths, White Stripes, Beck, and Nine Inch Nails, to name a few.<br /><br />I am a fan of independent films; a junkie when it comes to trash TV; I like going out to hear live music; going to parks to hear bands; and I am a huge fan of art; I go to the Met and Whitney museums and the Chelsea galleries once a month.&nbsp; <br /><br />I travel a lot with my work, but hope to meet all of you soon.<br /><br />Best, Van<br /><br /><br /><br />
