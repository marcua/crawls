				So far the lil munchkin (almost 11 weeks!) and i have had good luck going to the following places with the stroller and having a dandy time with no servers or staff giving us the stink eye (or patrons either but that&#039;s because he usually sleeps his way through our jaunts outdoors)<br />Time Cafe<br />Cronin &amp; Phelans<br />Sweet Afton (but just for early brunch)<br />Il Bambino<br />Dillingers (during steak night no less!)<br /><br />Where else have you taken your little ones or seen moms/dads and strollers having a little bit of sane adult time? I live down south astoria but on Monday we braved the hour walk it took to get to Steinway and Ditmars so we aren&#039;t afraid to walk (as long as its a quick meal for me) and there&#039;s the car when John is around.<br />thanks!<br />

				Bohemian Hall.&nbsp; Fresh air for the little one, beer and good food for the adults.&nbsp; Often fun music.<br /><br /><br />Igloo and Mojave have outdoor areas where there is ample space for the stroller.<br /><br /><br />Is it a regular stroller or a snap &amp; go?&nbsp; If it&#039;s a snap &amp; go - any place with booths is good as long as you&#039;re willing to leave the stroller folded somewhere.

				Thanks for the suggestions. I&#039;m pretty sure what I have isn&#039;t a snap and go. He&#039;s only turning 12 weeks this week so he&#039;s in a car seat adapted to the stroller. But so far we haven&#039;t had any trouble pulling it up to a table or fitting the car seat into a booth.<br />C&#039;mon moms and dads surely there are more places. I know I&#039;ve seen a stroller outside at Locale,and plan to experiment with cafe bar sometime soon. The manager at william hallet invited us to come back with the baby (but they changed the menu again so that&#039;s a ? For us)<br />Any other places?

				this is a very child friendly area.&nbsp; very few restaurants are going to object to a baby and stroller. <br />when our daugher was a baby we used to go to the Mexican restaurant by the Ditmars stop.&nbsp; they were always really friendly and accomodating. so was the Afgan place on 31st street. now that she is a bit older, regularly her (and often the stroller) to a wide range of the local restaurants.&nbsp; If the place is packed, we leave the stroller outside, but if we are there during a slack time most places are fine with finding a place for the stroller.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;

				In general, I have found rebb_&#039;s experience to be very similar to mine.<br /><br />I think the car seat that snaps into the stroller is the snap and go - or just like it, anyway.&nbsp; I think I&#039;ve blocked out the memory.<br /><br />But I&#039;ve been in most places in the Ditmars area with a stroller.&nbsp; When in doubt, we have asked - either by calling ahead or poking our heads in.&nbsp; If the weather is suitable and they have an outdoor space, we try to sit outdoors.&nbsp; We&#039;ve also been to many places on 31st Ave (Il Bambino, Bareburger, Pachanga) without issues.&nbsp; And while I haven&#039;t been to Vesta with one, I called once and asked if we could bring in a stroller early during their brunch hours, and they said it wouldn&#039;t be a problem.&nbsp; Generally if it&#039;s a place that might be less child-friendly, we always ask, and we always go early or at other off-hours to minimize any conflicts (including Sparrow, where we find that we have been welcome for an early or late brunch, or early dinner).&nbsp; We haven&#039;t had a problem yet.

				No problems here, either!&nbsp; Most important thing is to mind the time you are going.&nbsp; <br />We brought a stroller to Sunswick once, in the very beginning.&nbsp; It was lunchtime and I was nervous so I offered to fold up the stroller and the waitress looked at me and waived around the mostly empty place and said &quot;Oh yeah, we really need that room!&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />The most baby/child/stroller friendly restaurant I&#039;ve found is Bareburger.&nbsp; That place is baby central most of the time.<br />I&#039;ve seen a stroller at sugarfreak recently, even later in the evening.&nbsp; Other unmentioned places: 5 napkin burger (huge), and pomme cafe is super baby/stroller friendly.<br />&nbsp;<br />It gets easier when your babe can sit in the highchair... just wear &#039;em in a sling to the restaurant, no worries about the stroller!<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;
