				Hello all!<br /><br />I stumbled upon this wonderful website after spending many a night searching for apartments on Craigslist/NYT/VV.<br /><br />Needless to say, I&#039;m pretty fed up with the lack of response from brokers and immense response from scammers.<br /><br />I am starting graduate school at the City University of New York&#039;s Graduate School of Journalism this fall. I begin orientation Aug 18th. I&#039;m looking to find a place and move to Astoria by then. If not, September 1 will work.<br /><br />Here are the issues:<br /><br />-Budget: I need to find a larger studio/1BR for $1200 or less (which I think is fathomable based on what I&#039;ve seen)<br />-Details: I have great credit (700+) but I am a full time student. I will be working and will have the &quot;luxury&quot; of loan money to spend on rent/utilities. I don&#039;t, however, make 40x the monthly rent. Unless you count student loans--<em>do landlords/brokers do this?</em> Both of my parents are retired and are on a fixed income, which won&#039;t allow them to be my guarantors with the whopping 80x the monthly rent requirement.<br /><br />Which leaves me asking: what on earth is a young professional/student supposed to do to find an apartment? I don&#039;t need a luxurious space, just a clean apartment in a safe neighborhood close to the Subway.<br /><br />I&#039;m pretty lost on my options. People are turning me away left and right because I am a student, but I&#039;m perfectly capable of paying the rent and utilities and necessary deposit. Calls to brokers in Astoria remain unreturned.<br /><br />Any help would be oh-so-greatly appreciated!<br /><br />If you know of any studios/1BR in Astoria that need to be sublet, etc, please please please contact me.<br /><br />I hope you all have a great night and thanks in advance for the insight :)

				I feel your frustration. It&#039;s definitely a more complicated process than it needs to be. As dar as your income situation, I&#039;ve seen some people just pay rent in advance in order to compensate for their lack of income. If you got your student loan money in a lump sum, this may be a viable option to present to the prospective landlord.<br />My friend is a grad student at NYU and also using her student loans to pay living expenses. What she negotiated with her landlord was 4 months rent up front to get her place. I hope it works out for you- I know the frustration of apartment hunting!

				Have you thought about being a roommate?<br /><br />I am also a full time grad student at CUNY, and a lot of my colleagues share rooms, because they simply don&#039;t have the money to afford 1200/month. You could live much closer, or save some cash if you roomed with people.<br /><br />If that&#039;s not an option, do you have any income from the previous year? Even just a pay stub or something showing income can be helpful...and craigslist is pretty hit and miss, especially if you&#039;re dealing with the brokers that post on it. A lot of the stuff in Astoria, as I have seen in the last two weeks, is posted by two or three people and are just the same apartments over and over again. It really helps to be here and walk around the area, if that&#039;s a possibility, and talk to supers.<br /><br />Just my .02<br /><br />

				Ah, thank you everyone!<br /><br />I&#039;m definitely open to having roomies, I&#039;m just not a fan of having a lot of them. Can you tell I&#039;m scarred from past experiences?<br /><br />Thanks for the advice!
