				Hey, when CompUSA spashes a three-day sale having begun today, you get the idea that they&#039;d like customers to come by and actually buy something.&nbsp; I had the urge to finish another WinBox, so I trudged over to the Columbus Square location to get the advertised Video Card.&nbsp; And you&#039;d think they&#039;d have at least one item of the two different cards advertised (AGP or PCI-e).&nbsp; Well, they have neither there.&nbsp; So I trudge down to 37th and Fifth Avenue and they don&#039;t even acknowledge the item&#039;s existence.&nbsp; To quote the snarly salesbuffoon &quot;If you don&#039;t see it there, we don&#039;t have it.&quot;&nbsp; There are so few items for sale in that sale, but the best answer this lummox can come up with is &quot;don&#039;t see it, don&#039;t have it.&quot;<br /><br />The other tell-tale sign of near-death was the almost vacant sales floor at the Columbus Sq. location.&nbsp; I swear, there&#039;s so much open space that even with more of it occupied for large flat screens there&#039;s almost nothing being hawked there.&nbsp; &nbsp;Even after closing half their stores you get the sense the other shoe will eventually drop.<br /><br />- Cannibal

				CompUSA and Circuit City are pretty awful stores.&nbsp; Their employees work on commission so they try to sell you everything, yet they know nothing about computers.&nbsp; I only go if I know what I&#039;m getting and where it is.&nbsp; But usually, it&#039;s easier to order all that stuff online and cheaper, or just go to Best Buy.

				The last 2 times I was at CompUSA, I went for their well publicised sales items. They did not have what they advertised, nor did they have any other comparable priced item, so each time I left empty handed. The salespeople didn&#039;t look happy to be there either. A coworker told me that his brother used to work there, and he heard they only stock a small amount of sales products to lure customers in, hoping they will buy other items instead. I haven&#039;t been back there in over 1 year, and I probably never will either.

				As predicted by the date of this thread, CompUSA&#039;s 100 remaining stores will be closed by the heartless Mexican telecom investor that ran it the rest of the way into the ground.<br /><br />No mourning here.&nbsp; :lol:<br />- Cannibal

				I just saw this this morning. Has anyone visited a nearby store in the last few days? Any good stuff? If they have good sales it might be a good idea to head on over...
