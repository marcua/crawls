			Ive been twice now with different people.<br /><br />The chef/owner is one proud man! &nbsp;the first night he sent out a round of assorted apps for us to try and what a hit. &nbsp; salads, dips and something new, a cigar roll cheese blintz sort of item that tasted great and they ran out right away both nights we were there.<br /><br />The seafood tagine was plentifull and delicious (the chef said that if we didnt like it he wouldnt charge us). &nbsp;we ate the lamb so fast we didnt have time to think about it, it was that good.<br /><br />Id say that this may be worth returning to. &nbsp;food over all was nice, flavorful and reasonably priced, pretty good service just takes a while but then what in our Astoria doesnt, the younger waiter seems to like turning up the music but will lower it upon request. <br /><br />This owner seems to have invested himself deeply in his place and his food and that means a lot.
