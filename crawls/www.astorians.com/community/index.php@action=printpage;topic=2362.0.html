I used them in a salad and in a Diane pan sauce for chicken, and had no problems. The flowers were tasty!<br /><br />I tried braising the leeks, and they were a bit chewy because they were underdone. I think to make them cook evenly I should have separated the layers during cooking, so that the thicker parts would get cooked better. But I think that was my fault, not the leeks...<br /><br />What did you do, specifically, that didn&#39;t work? <br />

				The leeks I tried frying in some stir fry, once I cooked them a lot, the other time just lightly. Maybe they were undercooked.<br /><br />As for the chives they were really thick, almost like chewing on hay. Perhaps I just got a particularly dry bunch or something. I couldn&#39;t get those right by either frying, or baking them (in a dish). These were different from the chives I&#39;ve seen at the store which seem less hay-like and more thin and soft.

I don&#39;t think they work that way very well. They definitely seem to have more cellulose and less water than, say, a white onion. I suppose you could cook them separately (braised, say), and then add them to the stir-fry later, but that&#39;s probably more work than you&#39;d want to do... I generally think of leeks as being boiled (in soup), braised, or steamed, but not really just stir-fried...<br /><br />The chives we got had flowered already. I actually mostly used the shoots without flowers, and those were smaller and maybe a little more tender... I&#39;m a little surprised that baking them didn&#39;t work, though! The moisture from the other stuff you were combining them with should have steamed them...<br /><br />

				I&#39;ll remember that advice about the leeks. As for the chives, yeah it didn&#39;t make sense to me. I think I might have gotten a particularly thick bunch.

				Yup, I found some of the chives unchewable.&nbsp; I think they were the stems for the flowers.&nbsp; I had cut up all of my remaining chives, sauteed it with green garlic and butter, then scrambled in some eggs.&nbsp; For lunch, I dug in, and it was quite tasty, until I had to spit something out.&nbsp; Turns out it was a woody chive bit.&nbsp; I&#39;ve got more egg concoction to eat tonight, and I&#39;ll need to pick out the offensive chives before I dig in.&nbsp; *sigh*<br /><br />&nbsp;:-(

				i thought it was just me!<br /><br />i &#39;dried&#39; out the chives in my oven on low overnight... i thought maybe i had the heat on too high and that&#39;s why they were tuff.....hrm..... very crunchy... or tuff... it was kinda sucky. :(

				Maybe the woody chives would be good for an olive oil infusion?

				That&#39;s an interesting suggestion Meg!<br /><br />I did use the chives on a baked potato the day after we got them and they were fine, but I likely used the non-flowered ones. But yeah, my twice-baked potatoes with chives were sadly not as good as I had hoped due to the toughness. Maybe next time!<br /><br />On a positive note my dill is not hay-like at all. ;)
