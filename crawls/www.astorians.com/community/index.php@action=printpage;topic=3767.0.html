				<br />White Sox to start home games at 7:11<br /><br /><br />The White Sox will start weeknight home games at 7:11 p.m. as part of a sponsorship deal with the 7-Eleven convenience store chain.<br /><br />White Sox spokesman Scott Reifert would not disclose the value of the three-year deal with the Dallas company Wednesday but said the revenue probably will be reinvested in the team or ballpark.<br /><br />The new start time hardly represents a significant change since many weeknight games at U.S. Cellular Field already start at 7:07 p.m.<br /><br />&quot;We&#39;re just talking about four minutes, so it&#39;s not much of an inconvenience for the fans,&quot; Reifert said.<br /><br />Margaret Chabris, a spokeswoman 7-Eleven, said the company has been trying to develop sponsorships with other teams and entertainment venues. The Chicago area was targeted because of its more than 180 7-Eleven stores.<br /><br />&quot;Every time the media announces the game&#39;s start time it will be a gentle reminder of our sponsorship,&quot; Chabris said.<br />

				I used to work for a minor-league team, and I&#39;m surprised that they haven&#39;t done this before. We had EVERYTHING sponsored. If this is actually from The Onion, it&#39;s a decent idea. If this was published in the Onion a few years ago, I&#39;d totally try to sell this! (but, I don&#39;t work there anymore, oh well, haha.)<br /><br />Of course, the indie league minors are a different beast from the majors.&nbsp; :evil: Like I said, if it&#39;s a fake story, it&#39;s gonna make someone an awesome commission when they sell it.

				Too bad the ChiSox still won&#39;t be able to get more than 5,000 people to attend a game even when they&#39;re playing .600 ball and it&#39;s half-price ticket night and their stadium&#39;s barely ten years old and is very convenient to get to via PT and they&#39;re giving away Ozzie Guillen punching bags and there&#39;s great Ukranian food and Schaller&#39;s Pump a few blocks away.&nbsp; Are six minutes going to change anything?&nbsp; Go back to wearing shorts, admit that Frank Thomas is having a friggin&#39; fantastic season (over .400 in the post-season!), and remember the days when A.J. Pierczynski could steal a playoff series in a single questionable play.&nbsp; You&#39;re DONE FOR, Slevins or no!
