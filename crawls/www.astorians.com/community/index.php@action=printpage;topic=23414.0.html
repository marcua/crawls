				There&#039;s a new pizzeria going in at 36-08 Ditmars -- in what used to be the American Woodworking space. <br /><br />Some info here: http://queensnyc.com/2012/08/more-pizza-is-coming-to-ditmars-blvd-in-astoria/ (http://queensnyc.com/2012/08/more-pizza-is-coming-to-ditmars-blvd-in-astoria/)<br /><br />But I&#039;ll add more: @AstoriaHaiku on Twitter talked to someone there who said it would be &quot;different than anything&quot; and &quot;Italian style.&quot;<br /><br />To me that screamed Neapolitan wood-oven pizzeria. Sure enough. I poked my head in today and saw they had a Stefano Ferrara wood oven all set up and looked pretty dang close to opening. The workers in there said &quot;next month,&quot; and @Astoriahaiku quoted them as saying 2 to 3 weeks. They&#039;ve done a lot of work already. Did a good job of keeping this a secret. <br /><br />A Stefano Ferrara oven doesn&#039;t guarantee great pizza, but it&#039;s considered the Cadillac of pizza ovens. Whoever is opening this place shows signs of wanting to do it right.

				Commitment to good quality ingredients, consistent quality and an emphasis on welcoming, well-trained customer service. If these are added to the top-of-the-line pizza oven, then they could have quite a business on their hands. I&#039;m always amazed that restaurant owners don&#039;t understand these basics, or feel that they can work without some or all of them.

				The other pizza place that opened over there didn&#039;t last long.&nbsp; I heard the pizza wasn&#039;t so great.&nbsp; Yes Alba&#039;s may have a loyal following, but when this new place opens they might decide to try it and if it&#039;s better than Alba&#039;s I&#039;m sure that they would switch and go to the new place.&nbsp; I know that I would.

				Doesn&#039;t strike me as a slice sort if place. Neapolitan style is typically cooked to order. Maybe they&#039;ll have plain slices, but I think the types on the menu will be selections for ordering a pie.

				I usually get the plain regular slice.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure they would sell slices.&nbsp; Most people don&#039;t go in to get a whole pie.&nbsp; I hope it&#039;s not going to be like a sit down restaurant where you have to wait for a waiter or waitress to take your order.&nbsp; I would prefer to go up to the counter to order my slice.

				There is a reason that brick oven places typically do not offer slices.&nbsp; &nbsp;The shelf life of brick oven pizza is very short.&nbsp; &nbsp;neapolitan pies even shorter.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />A reheated brick oven slice is far inferior to hot out of the oven.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />If you just want a slice it would be better to hit a &quot;street slice&quot; place like Megc mentioned.&nbsp;

				Actually, and I don&#039;t mean to be contentious at all, the same site makes a good argument for letting the consumer&#039;s taste buds decide. Sounds like even with that designation there is still some debate over whether it&#039;s &quot;better&quot; pizza or not. <br /><br />http://slice.seriouseats.com/archives/2011/06/what-is-vpn-pizza.html (http://slice.seriouseats.com/archives/2011/06/what-is-vpn-pizza.html)<br /><br />And FWIW, the founder of that site is the one who started this thread.

				Glad some of you found those links from Slice informative. (Erma Gherd: I&#039;m no longer editing Slice, but I still write for the site.)<br /><br /><br />As far as size and whether you can finish a whole pizza, if you&#039;ve been to Forno Italia (which is now &quot;under renovation&quot;), it&#039;s like that. Same size of pizza, and no, you can&#039;t do slice-only. It&#039;s whole pies. Like at Grimaldi&#039;s or Totonno&#039;s or Lombardi&#039;s.<br /><br /><br />Makes sense that Sandy delayed them. DOB inspectors are probably tied up re-evaluating hurricane-damaged structures.<br /><br /><br />I can&#039;t wait to try this place. Been walking by it almost daily looking for signs of opening.

				Can&#039;t wait to try this place, but I wish they had on their menu a white pizza with mushrooms, caciocavallo, mozzarella and truffle oil. So delicious! I could probably eat a large pie all by myself. I always order this at Enoteca on Court St. when I&#039;m in Brooklyn craving pizza.

				First impression: this pizza is very, very good. The crust is fantastic - it&#039;s got a nice chew and great flavour. We had two pies: margherita and quattro formaggi. Flavours were balanced and the crust held up nicely in the margherita, although the cheeses overloaded it a bit in the quattro formaggi (not in taste, but in structure). We also had a mixed greens and endive salad with fennel, goat cheese, walnuts and pears, and finished the meal with their &quot;tirami-choux&quot; -- tiramisu flavours in a French-style cream puff. Both were very tasty.<br /><br />They had some opening night service hiccups, but were very apologetic about everything, and we are certainly not holding any of it against them - you really have to expect issues on opening night. The important thing is that the food was excellent.<br /><br />We have decided that we have to try every pie on the menu, and have started a list.<br /><br />Quick note - they do not yet have their liquor license but I think they will be getting it (or hope to get it) in the next week or so.<br />

				Got a couple pies last night. Totally excellent, but Basil is still the best in town. Will definitely go to this place when I don&#039;t feel like going over to Basil, because Tufino is much closer to me, but when I want the best, I know where I&#039;ll be headed. They did a really nice job with this place though, looks great inside. I was slightly alarmed by how young just about everyone who worked in the place was. Be cool guys, don&#039;t go putting your success up your noses. We want this place to stick around. Can never have enough good pizza in the neighborhood.

				Went last week- thought the pizza was very good (we got Bufala Mozzarella, and Nonna), and the appetizers were MONEY (Some fried mozzarella ball stuffed with Soprasseta).<br /><br />The service was definitely a little sloppy, but they were very nice. Definitely just working out the kinks.<br /><br />The Nutella pizza dessert was delicious, as was the Tiramisu. <br /><br />I have not had Basil Brick Oven yet, so I cannot compare, but that is on my list.<br /><br />Overall I was satisfied with Tufino, and will definitely be going back.

				Tufino&#039;s pies are more Neapolitan than those at Basil, which explains the difference. The Neapolitan-style pizza is more doughy (as TJT says about Tufino). It tends to be softer and puffier. Basil&#039;s owner is from a different part of Italy (Piedmont), where, he says, the crust is crisper, thinner, and they tend to use more cheese. It&#039;s probably a pizza more in line with American pizza preferences. I liked what I had at Tufino and will definitely be back. I tried the San Gennaro (tomato sauce, sausage, pepper, onion, hot honey) and the Pistachiana (pistachios, red onion, ricotta). The San Gennaro was very good. Crusts were a little inconsistent from pie to pie, but they&#039;re probably still learning the ropes. I&#039;m eager to try more of the menu. Service was friendly enough when we went, but yeah, $2.50 for an 8-ounce Coke is hard to swallow. Maybe they&#039;ll consider dropping the price on that when they get their beer and wine license and can make up for it there.

				The food was ok, but I do not usually like the dough being cripsy on the edges and soft/undercooked in the middle. <br /><br />I don&#039;t usually write about restaurants here, but when I do, it&#039;s because I have a small rant.<br />Here&#039;s my little rant:<br /><br />They were friendly but the waitress was a bit annoying and pushy. She didn&#039;t give us even 1 minute to look over the menu. She kept coming back and suggested items randomly. &quot;Oh do you like mushrooms, here&#039;s a mushroom pie, do you know what rice balls are? Should I bring some&nbsp; over?... etc.. etc.. etc..&quot; Geez. Give me 5 minutes so I can look over the menu and let me decide. WTF. Got me angry as hell inside. I felt so pressured that I had to pick a random pie and when it came to my wife to order, she didn&#039;t even have a chance to read the menu. So the waitress suggested that she should come back. She gave us literally 20 seconds, came back, and started going through the different ingredients on each item. I had to pick another random pie just to get rid of her.<br /><br />What also pissed me off heavily was she kept trying to upsell me on appetizers and desert after I was done with my pizza. We told her we didn&#039;t want anything else, just the check. She kept insisting. In the end I bought the freaking desert to-go and chucked it once I got outside. I was being nice by not telling her off, plus it was a new place so I didn&#039;t want to cause a scene. But damn, seriously wanted to tell her to f**k off. I kept my cool though. It felt as if I was at a retail store and was being shadowed by a salesperson working on commission. Not a pleasant experience. <br /><br />In the end I spent 55$ for 2. (2 pizzas, 1 bottle water, 1 desert).<br /><br />If you hate retail-style shadowers that are pushy, avoid eating there. Instead, order it for pickup and leave.<br /><br />All in all, the pizza was good enough where I would give it another chance, delivered if possible.<br /><br />Disclaimer: Your experiences may vary.

				The fact that you had a &quot;horrible&quot; experience and still enjoyed the food enough to go back proves that the pizza is pretty darn good

				The past few times I passed by Tufino&#039;s it wasn&#039;t crowded at all and I only saw people sitting at one table.&nbsp; I wonder if business will pick up.&nbsp; I think they are limited because they only serve pizza.&nbsp; Maybe they should branch out and serve other Italian dishes.&nbsp; Most pizza places serve other dishes besides pizza.&nbsp; Look at the Pizza Palace and also Albas

				When I went for dinner on Friday night, it was almost completely full - when did you walk by?&nbsp; I think it much better to specialize in something and do it well than to dilute the menu just for the sake of branching out.&nbsp; Pizza Palace is not good, and Alba&#039;s is fine but nothing to write home about.&nbsp; Have you eaten at Tufino - the pizzas I had there were excellent.

				I&#039;ve passed by multiple times over the last week, and anytime in the evening it always seemed moderately crowded. I went opening week, and thought the pizza was quite good. I&#039;ll be going back soon. I think the fact that they aren&#039;t serving any alcohol yet is holding some people back. I can see it being a great place to grab a glass of wine or a beer once they start serving.

				I do agree with that (the pushy experience) - we had barely sat down before we were asked if we knew what we wanted.&nbsp; However, what we wound up getting was very tasty.

				We didn&#039;t have any service issues at all, but if I had someone hawking me like astoriabot described, there&#039;s no way I would have tolerated it quietly.&nbsp; Management can only correct what is called out to them and from what I saw personally, I&#039;d bet they&#039;d have done something if it was called out to them in the moment.&nbsp; they seemed genuinely interested in making sure we were taken care of nicely and listened to what we asked and had to say both positive and not so positive.&nbsp;

				Pizza Palace has gone way downhill over the years. It used to be much better. <br /><br /><br />We went to Tufino and had a lovely time. Our waiter did not rush us, our pizza was delicious, and the arancini was amazing. Had some soft drinks and just relaxed. Nice people running the place. We&#039;ll be back.

				Finally ate here last night and really liked it!&nbsp; The Caesar salad was nothing to write home about but the fried mozzerella was amazing!<br />&nbsp;<br />We each had our own pie (I had the Bufala) and both were pretty tasty.&nbsp; Service was great as well without being pushy.&nbsp; This is a great addition to the &#039;hood and I look forward to going back and trying more of the menu!

Also the San Gennaro, with the spicy honey is very tasty. I also think they are a great addition to Astoria - I&#039;m very happy places like Tufino and Basil have opened up here!
