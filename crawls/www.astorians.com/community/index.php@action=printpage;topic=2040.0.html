				So, a few of us here get together on a semi-regular (hopefully more regular now that it&#39;s warmer) basis and run together in Astoria, usually in the Ditmars/Astoria Park area.&nbsp; We also run at the Central Park Reservoir when possible.&nbsp; Sometimes early mornings, sometimes evenings and also on some Saturday mornings.&nbsp; The runs are pretty low-pressure and right now are around 3 miles or so; some of us are trying to get back into said regular running and up the mileage. Right now is great running weather!&nbsp; If anyone would like to join in the fun, post here or let me know.&nbsp; I know that it helps me to have other people to run with.&nbsp; Oh, one more thing - Saturday morning runs usually incorporate the goal of eating pancakes afterwards, and that is worth the run all in itself!<br /><br />We have a great time and would love to see more local runners!&nbsp; Come join us!

				&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; &nbsp;Now that the warmer weather has arrived, I&#39;m coming out of hibernation. I would like to do some runs around the neighborhood and I know some other friends who can come , too. Let me know what the plan is and we can all get some fresh air and sun.

				Count me in, too, Meg.&nbsp; All this delightful New York food is catching up with me.&nbsp; Pastry classes aren&#39;t helping either!&nbsp; I&#39;m down for Saturday mornings!&nbsp; Just tell me when and where.

				We have been meeting around 9:30am at the corner of 23rd Ave and 29th Street, running to the park and about the track, and then running back to Zorbas, which is on 23rd Ave between 29th St. and 31st St.&nbsp; We are going to start thinking about other routes for weekday runs, I think.&nbsp; But Saturdays at the park/track is good, so that people can all come together who are at different fitness levels and get a run in that works for them.&nbsp; Oh, and sometimes people just meet at the track about 15 minutes after we leave our corner at 29th St.&nbsp; <br /><br />Pancakes are pretty good at Zorba&#39;s, too!&nbsp; It would be great to see some additional folks joining in the fun.&nbsp; I know DomNation you have expressed interest, too!&nbsp; Cool.

				<br />http://www.nyrr.org/race/2006/r0604x00.php<br /><br />In Central Park, almost 5 miles in June, sounds like quite a bit to attempt.<br />Might be worth trying nonetheless.<br /><br />And, if it is the southern part of the Park, it could be less deadly.&nbsp; &nbsp;:cry:<br />for your interest<br /><br />

				&nbsp;:cry:&nbsp; &nbsp;I would love to join you all in running to the park but I unfortunately work on Saturday mornings. If you happen to run on any other morning ( or evening) I can do it.<br />Thanks ! :-)

				We run a lot of other mornings.&nbsp; Usually 3x during the week early, 7:30ish, a three mile loop/route down to and around the park/track and home.<br /><br />Not particularly fast though.&nbsp; Figure 11 min miles on a good day.<br /><br />Food at the end of these runs though, is not a guarantee.<br /><br />-j

				I&quot;m also interested in running early mornings or evenings - Saturday mornings work very well too.<br /><br />I run between 1-3 miles on average, not too fast, but really need a partner to keep the motivation.

				There are two.<br /><br />1) Astoria&#39;s &quot;cool runnings&quot; yahoo group of folks that are new to running.&nbsp; Small group that is going on year 2 -- mellow.&nbsp; Weekly highlight is pancake run on Saturday (running and then, the eating of pancakes!)<br /><br />2) hellgate road runners -- serious running group -- not sure of the URL at the moment.

				Great, thanks. Is there a direct link to the yahoo group? I could not find it by searching on the yahoo group site.<br /><br />here&#39;s the link to Hell Gate Road Runners: http://www.hrr-online.org/<br /><br />May be too hardcore for me.
