				It&#039;s getting pretty hot and I&#039;m going to need another a/c unit now that I have a living room.&nbsp; <br /><br />My living room is about 17x12.&nbsp; I&#039;d like something cheap, but I&#039;d also like something that doesn&#039;t make too much noise and will cool the whole room.&nbsp; <br /><br />I currently have one from my old studio which was about $150 (I think), but it makes so much noise that it would wake me up in the middle of night.&nbsp; <br /><br />Can anyone recommend anything?

				Pizza,<br /><br />I just went to PC Richards last night on Steinway to buy an a/c.&nbsp; Unfortuantely, me being me, forgot to bring the measurements of my apartment and window so I had to walk back home.&nbsp; I will, however, be buying an a/c on Friday as excessive heat makes me&nbsp; :x :oops: :lol: :evil:<br /><br />Anyway, the PC Richards website allows you to enter your dimensions in and will recommend the right a/c.&nbsp; <br /><br />http://www.pcrichard.com/catalog/thumbnail.jsp?parentCategoryId=1&amp;categoryId=5000&amp;subCategoryId=5010<br /><br />For four straight summers, I used a crappy 5,000 BTU a/c that the old Wiz on Broadway pretty gave to me so they could get it out of their store, and it was perfect for my 10 * 12 room.&nbsp; Make sure you note how high your ceilings are as well.

				An a/c unit with a good energy efficiency rating, plus a timer to let you turn the a/c on a specific time before you are home is also an element to consider.&nbsp; I bought my air conditioner from PC Richards two years ago and it has a very good energy efficiency rating (it&#039;s got an energy star symbol on it).&nbsp; It is a Frigidaire.&nbsp; Good luck.

				I too have a Frigidare A/C from PC Richards that we are very happy with. Bought it last year - I think it was about $150/$160. The salesperson was very helpful. We did bring in the room dimensions and he was able to point us in the right direction. Goodluck. <br /><br />You might also want to check out Best Buy on Northen Blvd. <br /><br />

				I don&#039;t off the top of my head- but I will look and see if I can find the receipt in my files and if the name is printed on the receipt somewhere. If it is I will let you know. I just remember the guy didn&#039;t pressure us at all- which I love. I am definately the type of customer who likes to be left alone!&nbsp; :lol:

				Thanks.&nbsp; I have to go back on Friday evening and purchase an a/c.&nbsp; Despite the fact that I live in a smaller apartment, I have more square footage to cool as I basically found refuge in the comfort of my bedroom in my last place.&nbsp; The bedroom &amp; living room are essentially the same room in my current apartment, with a crappy french door in the middle.&nbsp; I could just close said mentioned door and sleep on the futon next to my tv, but then I would feel like a caged animal!&nbsp; Besides, now that I actually have a job, I can afford coolness&nbsp; :mrgreen: 8-)

				From http://www.consumerreports.org:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><strong>HOW TO CHOOSE</strong><br /><br />Here are some tips that can help you choose an appropriately sized air conditioner that combines performance, efficiency, and value:<br /><br /><strong>Determine how much cooling you need.</strong> A general rule is that 5,000 to 6,000 Btu/hr. models cool rooms 100 to 300 square feet; 7,000 to 8,200 Btu/hr. models cool rooms 250 to 550 square feet; and 9,800 to 12,500 Btu/hr. models cool rooms 350 to 950 square feet. Room construction, climate, and other factors also affect your choice.<br /><br /><strong>Consider window location.</strong> Does the air conditioner need to blow air to the left or right to direct air to the room&#039;s center for uniform cooling? Most models do a better job directing air in one direction or the other, in part because of the design of their internal fan. Our Ratings show which models are more directionally biased than others.<br /><br /><strong>Look for third-party certification.</strong> When assessing EER, look for a certification sticker from the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM) or the Canadian Standards Association (CSA). An energy-efficient unit will not only help the environment but may also qualify for rebates in some areas; see the Energy Star Web site, at www.energystar.gov, for details.<br /><br /><strong>Don&#039;t buy features you don&#039;t need.</strong> Low-profile models take up less space in your window and can direct air up, not just side-to-side, but tend to be pricier.<br /><br /><strong>Clean it periodically.</strong> With any model, clean the filter biweekly or as needed. Where possible, hose off the back of the unit if debris has clogged cooling coils.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />They chose the following 2 as best buys:<br /><br />Frigidaire 6000 BTU<br />FAA067P7 (from Lowe&#039;s) CR Best Buy $150<br />FAA065P7A $160<br /><br />Frigidaire 8000 BTU<br />FAA087P7 (from Lowe&#039;s) CR Best Buy $180<br />FAA085P7A $190,<br />FAA086P7A $200<br /><br />

				You are a wealth of information, NYMacUser&nbsp; :mrgreen:&nbsp; And to think, I almost bought an 18,000 BTU beast for $700!&nbsp; I really need to check with the group before making important decisions!

				Check Home Depot for AC units, I bought mine there, a 10,000 BTU LG window unit, they had it for $199 reg price less 10% sale, came in under $200 w/ tax.&nbsp; They probably don&#039;t still have the sale, but you can get &quot;moving&quot; coupons from HD or Lowes (HD will accept Lowes coupons) which are good for 10% off.<br /><br />My question for everyone:&nbsp; Does anyone know a good place to call to get my unit installed?&nbsp; I could probably do it myself, but I don&#039;t want to risk 1. messing it up, dropping it etc, or 2. starting something I can&#039;t finish.&nbsp; I called a couple places, best I found so far was for $125 for an intstall w/ NYC approved brackets and instead of accordian sides, something that will seal much better so it can stay in the winter.&nbsp; Anyone know of a cheaper solution?

				Quick bump.<br /><br />Does anyone know some place I can call about installing my window AC unit?&nbsp; The place that was $125 I found seems good, but I&#039;d like to see if someone can&#039;t find it cheaper.

				$125 dollars seems like a lot of money to have an a/c unit installed? Why don&#039;t you contact a freelance carpentar/handyman and see if they could install it for cheaper?

				I&#039;d also recommend posting your job on craigslist. You can often find handymen there that are willing to do small odd jobs for a minimal amount of cash.
