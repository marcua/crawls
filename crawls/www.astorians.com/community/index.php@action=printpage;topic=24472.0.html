				Dear Friends, <br /><br /><br />P.S. 122, which is located on Ditmars Blvd, has had an extremely successful gifted program for decades. Now it seems that their program is being shut down for no apparent good reason.&nbsp; In fact the school&#039;s constituents weren&#039;t even told that this was being considered.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Kids and families will be hurt by this action.&nbsp; Students will be torn away from the school they&#039;ve attended for years and the middle school population is scheduled to balloon.&nbsp; None of the proposed changes will benefit the school, the community, and especially the kids. <br /><br /><br />Please come to February 21st Community Council Meeting at P.S. 234 to voice your concern.&nbsp; P.S. 234 is located at 30-15 29th St, Astoria, 11102.&nbsp; Also, contact your local representatives and ask them to support one of the most successful schools in the state.<br /><br /><br />Councilman Peter Vallone : 718.274.0007<br /><br /><br />District Leader Costas Constantinides:&nbsp; costa4astoria@gmail.com<br /><br /><br />Assemblywoman Aravella Simotas:&nbsp; 718.545.3889<br /><br /><br />State Senator Michael Gianaris: 718.728.0960

				ALthough I agree that the DOE has been proposing random and frustrating changes in the district when they should be considering meeting the needs of the population without taking options away, it is my understanding that current G&amp;T kids in 122 would finish the program out.<br /><br /><br />I think that the more important issue is to improve all the schools in the area and offer great middle school options not just focus on the G&amp;T programs where spots are limited and if a 4yo does not test in, then their &quot;fate is sealed&quot; for years to come due to the lack of overall seats.&nbsp; The entire process is flawed.

				The middle school at 122 is one of the best in the state.&nbsp; It has been a great success.&nbsp; We do need more options and more spots for students who are gifted.&nbsp; Every child deserves to be in the appropriate class that will best meet their needs. <br />Why would we eliminate a program from 122 that works and has been so successful?&nbsp; It is a model that should be emulated not phased out!&nbsp; Open up more programs in this likeness, but do not destroy something that works and means so much to the community and to the students both past and present.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;

				Dear Cosmic. <br /><br /><br />I do agree with two of your main points.&nbsp; It is pretty self-evident that middle schools, as all schools, should provide amazing learning opportunities for ALL kids.&nbsp; They should be enriching environments regardless of who the target population is.&nbsp; Also, the emphasis on the G&amp;T testing has gotten out of hand lately.&nbsp; It has become an industry. However, it is also a fact that gifted children, like kids with learning and emotional disabilities, have special needs.&nbsp; The curious reader may want to peruse the National Association for Gifted Children website (www.NAGC.org) <br /><br /><br />Removing the gifted program from 122 does not make sense, no matter how you slice it. The vast majority of its students end up in specialized high-schools and those that do not get into the &quot;major&quot; special high schools do get admitted into other screened programs.&nbsp; Furthermore, the statistics regarding these kids trajectory in the world of higher education is very impressive to say the least.&nbsp; Speak to these young adults and all of them will testify to the special experience they had at 122. <br /><br /><br />This recent action has many objectionable components.&nbsp; To keep it simple though, how does eliminating a VERY successful program help children?&nbsp; If your point that excellent middle schools should be replicated everywhere is true, and I agree that it is, shouldn&#039;t 122 be the model?&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Hello all,<br /><br /><br />I have been a very active part of a group of parents from PS 122, PS 166 and PS 160 advocating for the *expansion* of the highly successful G&amp;T program at PS 122.&nbsp; The fact is, our district, District 30, is blessed with many children who would benefit from an accelerated or &quot;gifted&quot; education.&nbsp; &nbsp; Unfortunately, the DOE does not seem to want to provide this.<br /><br /><br />Parents from the above schools have attended CEC &amp; PEP meetings for several months.&nbsp; We have written letters to our elected officials.&nbsp; We have participated in meetings with DOE representatives.&nbsp; At every single meeting, we expressed our desire to EXPAND the wonderful program known as &quot;The Academy.&quot;<br /><br /><br />Instead, the DOE has chosen to destroy it.<br /><br /><br />We ask the community&#039;s support in getting this program reinstated and expanded.&nbsp; To eliminate it is to deprive many of our children of an appropriate education.<br /><br /><br />Everyone in a community benefits when children are placed in the learning environment that is best suited to their needs and talents.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Please join in writing to Chancellor Walcott and all the DOE representatives to let them know that our community does not support destroying this wonderful program.

				Couple of things:<br /><br /><br />1.&nbsp; This change does not only affect G&amp;T students.&nbsp; At PS 122, there exists room for 4 middle school classes.&nbsp; There are currently 7 classes per elementary grade.&nbsp; This means that access to the ELEMENTARY school, G&amp;T or not, will likely be reduced or become more competitive, to make room for enough Gen-Ed middle school seats.<br /><br /><br />2.&nbsp; My son is in G&amp;T at PS 150.&nbsp; His curriculum *began* one year ahead of his grade level.&nbsp; This is true of all G&amp;T programs in District 30.&nbsp; Children who do not receive a G&amp;T middle school seat due to the impending shortage will be essentially forced to repeat that grade.<br /><br /><br />3.&nbsp; Currently, all students in Gen-Ed are able to test into G&amp;T at the middle school level.&nbsp; Third and Fourth Grade test scores are used.&nbsp; TWO of the four classes at PS 122&#039;s Academy are kids who tested in from Gen-Ed (plus 1 from 122 and 1 from 150).&nbsp; So there&#039;s no &quot;fate&quot; you&#039;re forced into because of one test you take at 4.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Dear Bothhands5, <br /><br />I think that the information you present is important.&nbsp; It is vital that people begin receiving as much information regarding this situation as possible.&nbsp; I hope that you will be at the CEC to present what seems to be another perspective. <br /><br />I do have one important questions though.&nbsp; If there is room for more 4 more middle school classes at P.S. 122, why is there a shortage.&nbsp; Why can&#039;t the kids, who have been told there isn&#039;t room for them, go to 122?&nbsp; Wouldn&#039;t that seem to satisfy everyone&#039;s needs?&nbsp; <br />

				Prometheus:&nbsp; There&#039;s not room for 4 MORE classes, just 4 classes, total (or, at least, there are currently 4 classes per grade in the Academy, and we&#039;ve been told they are at capacity and cannot add any more).&nbsp; So, to turn 122 into a K-8, they will have to cut down the Academy to one (we presume) G&amp;T class per grade (those who are in 122&#039;s G&amp;T elementary....no longer from 150 OR testing in from Gen Ed).&nbsp; The DOE&#039;s proposal includes opening up G&amp;T middle school seats at I.S. 126, but we have no idea how many.&nbsp; There are currently G&amp;T programs at 122, 150, 166, Roosevelt Island (I forget the number), not to mention the kids at PS 85 STEM, who still have been given no middle school option.&nbsp; Adding a couple of classes to I.S. 126 would have been great, had they not taken away the current Academy classes.<br /><br /><br />I will definitely be at the CEC meeting tomorrow.&nbsp; I just don&#039;t see how this benefits ANYONE, and I also have a 2-year-old zoned for 122.

				I think it is an overstatement to say that they are going to &quot;destroy&quot; the Academy.&nbsp; My understanding is that they are reducing the middle school spots available in the Academy effective with the incoming 2014 kindergarteners, in order to add regular non G&amp;T junior high school spots. The reasoning, as I have heard it, is that 122 is the only school with a junior high ONLY for gifted kids, and not in line with the rest of the city. <br /><br />As a parent with one kid in the G&amp;T and another kid in the REALLY GREAT rest of the school, I think the implication that G&amp;T students are &#039;entitled&#039; to more is really unfortunate. <br /><br />As Cosmic posted above -- most of these kids came into the G&amp;T in kindergarten.&nbsp; It is simply not scientifically possible to test a 4 year old for &quot;giftedness&quot;.&nbsp; Actually what is being tested for is &quot;test preparedness.&quot;<br />&nbsp;http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/18/nyregion/new-york-city-schools-struggle-to-separate-the-gifted-from-the-just-well-prepared.html?pagewanted=all<br /><br />Even if you could legitimately test for &quot;giftedness&quot; at such a young age, I think very serious questions have yet to be answered about the effectiveness or usefulness of the G&amp;T.&nbsp; While I&nbsp; relish an opportunity for my kids to do enriched schoolwork and be given extra opportunities in the arts (some of which the G&amp;T provides, and some of which PS 122 provides for all students), the main goal of the G&amp;T is set in a citywide curriculum, and appears to be little more than acceleration of the current regular curriculum.&nbsp; &nbsp;Both the G&amp;T and the regular curriculum, in turn, are focused almost entirely on preparing for standardized tests. <br /><br />While acceleration of the curriculumin the G&amp;T may prevent boredom in some kids (for instance those who read at a young age, or those with really good math skills) I personally think we&#039;d be better off letting the teachers (in the G&amp;T and elsewhere) design their own enriched curriculum.&nbsp; <br /><br />Finally, focusing on having or not having a G&amp;T is really a subterfuge for the real issues -- the citywide standardization of curriculum for the goal of &quot;teaching to the test&quot;.&nbsp; Just to be clear, this is the fault of NYC Schools.&nbsp; We have excellent teachers all over Astoria who are not allowed to alter the curriculum because they are forced to teach to the test.&nbsp; Where&#039;s the outrage about that, guys?? <br />

				I am sorry to hear all this. I would hate to see the program shut down because so many children benefit from it, especially at the middle school level. <br /><br /><br />As an aside, I am not sure I am comfortable with the way the children are evaluated for qualification into this program. I&#039;ve seen some truly gifted kids go unnoticed because they weren&#039;t good test takers. I&#039;ve also seen an entire group of kids on my block qualify for citywide G&amp;T and I got kind of suspicious. Is it really possible for so many kids in one geographic area to get test results in the high 90&#039;s? Is the program over-populated? I don&#039;t know the enrollment numbers, but it would be interesting to compare District 30 enrollment to other districts around the city. Another interesting thing is that in other jurisdictions (outside NYC) the criteria for qualification for G&amp;T are different.

				Domenica, I agree with you too.&nbsp; There are many children who would benefit from an accelerated learning environment who are being shut out, because the DOE is not opening up enough seats for them.&nbsp; Just look at the statistics on how many children qualified for City-wide, and yet how few spaces are available.&nbsp; They&#039;re forcing us to compete, which is wrong.<br />&nbsp;<br />Parents have been asking the DOE to *expand* the G&amp;T program so that all children who would benefit may have access to it.&nbsp; Instead it appears to be being reduced.<br />&nbsp;<br />I&#039;m hoping we get more clarity at the CEC meeting on Thursday.

				BoredTemp- there currently is one G&amp;T class per grade in grades K-5 at PS122.&nbsp; In the middle school there may be 4.&nbsp; The changes as proposed are not going to affect the G&amp;T as far as grades K-5 are concerned.&nbsp; As to the middle school, since other schools are going to be adding middle school seats, some G&amp;T middle schoolers who might, under the current system, go to PS122, would go elsewhere (as their brethren at PS166 will do too). But again -- that&#039;s only applicable to kids entering K in 2014.<br /><br /><br />

				Hi Luchamos,<br />&nbsp;<br />It&#039;s good to have someone to discuss this with - it sounds like you may have more information than I do.<br />&nbsp;<br />I had heard that they are planning on adding 2 middle school classes at I.S. 126, but removing 3 middle school classes from P.S. 122 - resulting in a net loss to the district.<br />&nbsp;<br />Can you let us know what you&#039;re hearing?&nbsp; Part of the problem is we&#039;re just all getting bits and pieces and not an official notice.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />Thanks!&nbsp;

				Just sent you a PM with the info I have - but no, there is not an official notice as far as I can tell.&nbsp; <br />I don&#039;t know about the net total number of G&amp;T middle school spots.&nbsp; But please bear in mind that PS 122 serves all of the students, not just the G&amp;T.&nbsp; I think a lot of parents will be thrilled that their kids will get to stay at 122 for middle school even if they&#039;re not in the G&amp;T.&nbsp; I know I would be if my kid was entering the school in time to benefit from the change.<br />

				Luchamos, my understanding (as a 150 parent) was, as you say (and like most schools), 122 has one G&amp;T class per elementary grade.&nbsp; This will remain the same with the proposed changes.&nbsp; However, currently at the Academy, there are 4 classes per grade (1 from 150, 1 from 122, and TWO&nbsp; classes who test in from Gen Ed).&nbsp; Gen Ed kids make up 50% of the incoming middle school population.&nbsp; This is where the massive change has its effects.&nbsp; I 100% agree with you that there should be more opportunities for mobility, both in and out of the G&amp;T program.&nbsp; This becomes IMPOSSIBLE with a reduction in seats, particularly for the Gen Ed population, who didn&#039;t test in at age 4.&nbsp; They have a huge opportunity to advance into the program at middle school, which will cease to exist with the proposed changes.&nbsp; The proposal states that the G&amp;T from 122 will have priority into the one remaining middle school G&amp;T class--without testing.&nbsp; The remaining seats at I.S. 126 will be fought over bitterly between kids from 150, 166, and Gen Ed.&nbsp; This is a recipe for zero mobility, and zero opportunity for Gen Ed kids.&nbsp; I still don&#039;t understand how they plan on fitting the current 7-classes-per-elementary-grade into the middle school space that currently is maxed out at 4-classes-per-grade.<br /><br /><br />Additionally, no one has a plan for kids who are a year ahead in curriculum, and aren&#039;t given an appropriate middle school seat.&nbsp; Luchamos, it is too much to ask teachers with upwards of 27 kids in a class to give individualized attention to every learning level; they end up teaching to the middle.&nbsp; This is as detrimental to a G&amp;T child as it is to any other child with special needs.<br /><br /><br />I have a 2-year-old, zoned for 122.&nbsp; I definitely see the appeal for her to be guaranteed a K-8 option at 122.&nbsp; But not at the price of the G&amp;T program.&nbsp; It means *her* fate will be decided at 4, which currently would not be the case.&nbsp; And who knows what the culture and climate at a K-8 122 will be.<br /><br /><br />I sincerely hope that non-G&amp;T parents understand that this is an issue that affects everyone.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Bothhands, <br />When you say &quot;there are 4 classes per grade&quot; are you talking about the middle school?&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure where this information about seat allocation comes from (which is not to say it is not accurate, but I haven&#039;t heard it before, myself).&nbsp; <br />I&#039;m not sure what you mean about &quot;zero mobility and zero opportunity for Gen Ed kids&quot; either, can you flesh it out a bit more?&nbsp; <br /><br />I agree it is too much to ask that teachers with 27 kids in a class give individualized instruction to kids.&nbsp; Class sizes are a problem for everyone, G&amp;T, regular programs, and CTT classes too.&nbsp; It is no more nor less detrimental to G&amp;T kids (who at least theoretically have intellectual interests they can pursue, if they&#039;re bored) than it is to anybody else. <br /><br />I am however sad to see parents focusing so much attention on the G&amp;T programs which serve so little of our school populations.&nbsp; If we paid this much attention to getting rid of standardized testing, then we&#039;d really be getting somewhere. <br />

				My understanding was that the Academy (middle school) was comprised of 1 class from 122, 1 class from 150, and 2 classes who test in from Gen Ed.&nbsp; Currently, kids in any Gen Ed program have the ability to test into the Academy (and be part of those 2 classes, or, 50% of the Academy), based on OLSAT (50%) standardized ELA (25%) and standardized Math (25%) scores.&nbsp; Under the current proposal, the one G&amp;T class which would remain at 122&#039;s middle school would be filled, or nearly-filled with the 122 elementary G&amp;T kids, who will be given priority and will not, as the rest of the district would, have to re-test.&nbsp; That leaves however many seats they open up at I.S. 126 to cover the rest of the G&amp;T kids from 150, 166, Roosevelt Island, (possibly 85), and Gen Ed.&nbsp; We needed more seats to begin with...a reduction of seats is catastrophic.&nbsp; As I mentioned, I have a younger daughter, and, should she not test into G&amp;T at 4, I&#039;d want the opportunity for her to test in later, if we thought it would be beneficial.<br /><br /><br />I agree that it would be detrimental to any specialized group.&nbsp; My best friend&#039;s son is thriving in a CTT class.&nbsp; I can&#039;t imagine what they would do if they were told he couldn&#039;t continue in that program.<br /><br /><br />Also, responding to your assertion that G&amp;T parents feel their kids are more &quot;entitled&quot;, I could not disagree more.&nbsp; We simply want the appropriate education for our kids.&nbsp; I have been advocating for more defined EXIT points for kids who struggle in a G&amp;T program, just as much as I&#039;ve been advocating for more seats/entry points for Gen Ed kids who would benefit from a more rigorous program.

				Bothhands, <br />I definitely agree that the program needs to have more fluidity.&nbsp; The year before my son started K, it was still required that 4th graders re-test for a seat in the program.&nbsp; That made sense, but the districts evidently did away with that requirement.&nbsp; That&#039;s how we have ended up with locked-in classes from K-8.&nbsp; So if in fact the change in middle schools will mean fewer students entering into the G&amp;T, and more kids locked into the program from K, then I agree it&#039;s a problem.&nbsp; As an aside, what does this mean for IS 141? <br /><br /><br />As to all of these issues, I think they point out a much bigger concern in District 30-- total lack of governmental transparency. Why is the community only hearing about this after it is a fail accompli? Who makes these decisions, and what input can community members have before plans are finalized.&nbsp; What&#039;s really catastrophic here -- more than anything else -- is the total lack of communication.&nbsp; In these days of Twitter and Facebook, not to mention email, there is no reason this should be happening.&nbsp; I&#039;d really, really like to hear from anyone who can shed some light on this process.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Yes, many of us have been at CEC and PEP and Town Hall meetings since October, and have remained in contact with the co-president of the CEC, various councilmen, the media, and are no closer to being in the loop than we were at the start.&nbsp; They clearly have an agenda that they would prefer not to share.<br /><br /><br />No matter what happens with 122, retesting for middle school appears to be an eventuality (starting with the incoming 2013-2014 class), for all schools except 122, that is.&nbsp; The problem with that is that testing with a lack of seats is no good, either.&nbsp; The bar/competition will be so high for middle school seats that only the Top few percent of testers could make the cut for the limited amount of seats.&nbsp; Qualified students (who are a grade-level ahead, if they&#039;re coming from G&amp;T) are placed out with otherwise high scores, or cut out with EQUAL scores because of a lottery.&nbsp; Almost every child in my son&#039;s K class qualified for a Citywide spot, but, as we know, there are only a handful of those, so their &quot;fate&quot; is determined by lottery.<br /><br /><br />But the overarching issue right now is a hidden agenda that we&#039;ll likely never be privy to.&nbsp; They&#039;re moving to do away with G&amp;T entirely, which is a travesty.&nbsp; As I said...can you imagine any other Special Needs group being disenfranchised this way?

				If they are not going to do the G&amp;T program &quot;right&quot; then I actually think it should be phased out and they should have honors/accelerated classes beginning in 2nd grade ( when a child&#039;s abilities as a student are much clearer) as well as in middle schools.&nbsp; As I read in the newest G&amp;T booklet, they are no longer guaranteeing seats at all.&nbsp; Some children will always be kept out.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />

				The reason they are no longer guaranteeing seats is because they refuse to accommodate all the children who take the test.&nbsp; Instead of fostering a child&#039;s abilities when they present themselves by creating more seats, they&#039;re trying as many tactics as they can to weed children out.&nbsp; A lot of people think it&#039;s all about parental ego, but when you think about the actual kids in these scenarios, it&#039;s pretty terrible.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Cosmic - I understand what you&#039;re saying, but I have to respectfully disagree.&nbsp; This is only my own personal experience, My daughter reads and does math far, far above grade level.&nbsp; &nbsp;When she was in a GenEd class she was bored and acted out to get attention because she wasn&#039;t being challenged.<br />&nbsp;<br />Now that she is in a G&amp;T class with an accellerated curriculum and peers who are at the same academic level as she is, she is thriving.<br />&nbsp;<br />The word &quot;gifted&quot; is perhaps the problem.&nbsp; &nbsp;My daughter is no &quot;better&quot; or &quot;more blessed&quot; than anyone else - it&#039;s just that she is advanced academically.&nbsp; As such, she is best / most appropriately educated among classmates who also learn quickly and by a teacher who understands the best way to get children like her interested and movitivated.<br />&nbsp;<br />I liken it to sports.&nbsp; You have some children who can run very fast.&nbsp; You have others who may be great dancers.&nbsp; There are still others who have great hand-eye coordination.&nbsp; &nbsp;Each will excel at different things.&nbsp; Forcing them all to play exactly the same sport in exactly the same way is doing a disservice to them all.&nbsp; Some will be bored, others frustrated.&nbsp; If each is given appropriate training, designed to foster their strengths and improve on their weaknesses, they will all excel.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />That&#039;s what I want for all children in our district - the appropriate education that will allow them ALL to excel.&nbsp; &nbsp;For some that means G&amp;T classes, for some that means CTT and additional support.&nbsp; In the end, they should all succeed.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;

				I understand what you are saying and agree to a certain point but if all children do not have the opportunity to get a seat in the G&amp;T program, even after passing the test, that is an issue.&nbsp; All children are not being served in that case.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Additionally - many children are being prepped for the tests - not <span class="bbc_u">all</span> who pass are that much more advanced than other children.&nbsp; I still think that generally you have more information to go on when a child is in 1st-2nd grade to see where they should be placed than at age 4.<br /><br /><br />Honestly - I have seen from experience that some of the parents in the G&amp;T are only concerned with their class/program and not the school/community at large.&nbsp; THis may not be you - but there are many like this.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think cutting the program is the answer necessarily but it needs to change/evolve.&nbsp; Especially when the nature of the student population in the district is changing.

				Cosmic - EXACTLY!&nbsp; &nbsp;:cheesy: <br />&nbsp;<br />We are advocating for G&amp;T seats to be added so that *all* qualified children may access them.&nbsp; I would love to see multiple entry points added to the system.&nbsp; It would be wonderful for it not to be completely test based, but rather have a teacher be able to recommend a student for it based on the teacher&#039;s own experience with the child in the classroom.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />Then we would be getting somewhere.<br />&nbsp;<br />Step 1 is maintaining the program.&nbsp; Step 2 expanding.&nbsp; &nbsp;I feel like we&#039;re fighting tooth and nail just to get Step 1 accomplished, but I am in for the long haul, and will continue to fight for all the children in our district.<br />&nbsp;<br />I am sorry if your experience has been that G&amp;T parents are not concerned with the school as a whole.&nbsp; I can only speak to P.S. 150, but at PTA meetings and school functions, the G&amp;T parents make up a large of the attendees.&nbsp; Their efforts on behalf of the school as a whole (adding library resources, computers, recess enrichment programs, musical instruments) benefit all children at the school, not just the G&amp;T classes.

				@luchamos in regards to IS 141 (which is currently underutilized according to the DOE) the word is that the Success Academy maybe going in there.. this is only speculation as far as I can tell. BUT after going to PEP meetings this is what the DOE is doing; moving charter schools into existing schools that they consider underutilized. Bloomberg has stated the plan to open 26 new charter schools in the city by September and many more by 2014. I have no problem with a school opening in a truly underutilized school and the existing school welcoming the new school -like what is happening at IS 126 and what happened at PS 85. But to destroy the Academy to make room for a charter school at IS 141 is wrong. Hopefully this is all just speculation...<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I feel as a lifelong Astoria resident, an alum of PS 122 and an educator who has studied gifted education, I must make a few points.<br />Let me preface by saying that ALL students deserve quality education.&nbsp; ALL students deserve good schools and highly trained teachers who work together to meet every student&#039;s individual needs.&nbsp; By advocating for the gifted, we are not ignoring or diminishing the needs of every other student.<br />It is unfortunate to read some of these comments that suggest that people feel that gifted students think they are entitled to &quot;more.&quot;&nbsp; No one is arguing that they are entitled to more, but that they are entitled to a proper placement in a classroom that meets their needs.&nbsp; Gifted students have many emotional needs and they benefit from being in a program with teachers who understand their specific needs.&nbsp; It is not about boredom or accelerating the curriculum.&nbsp; When we are stressing the importance of every child making progress and growing, how can we cut gifted programs that allow for gifted students to grow and make progress that they would not be able to achieve in the regular classroom.&nbsp; The idea that if there is not enough room for all then it should be phased out is not a solution.&nbsp; Make room!&nbsp; It is the city&#039;s responsibility to provide appropriate education and meet the needs of all its students.&nbsp; You wouldn&#039;t cut services for special needs students because not everyone received this help.&nbsp; We would fight to make sure that every student with a special need received the resources they needed.&nbsp; <br />I also want to clarify something about 122.&nbsp; My family has been in Astoria for about fifty years.&nbsp; My parents attended 122 in the 1960&#039;s.&nbsp; It has always serviced elementary students.&nbsp; It is a k-5 school!&nbsp; In the late 1980&#039;s the district designated 122 as the home for the gifted middle school population.&nbsp; Thus was born the Academy for the Intellectually Gifted at PS 122.&nbsp; Students never stayed beyond elementary school.&nbsp; They graduated and went to IS 141 (their zoned middle school) or other middle school programs.&nbsp; Not because the gifted program took up space in 122, but because 122 was never a middle school.&nbsp; Over the years the gifted program has expanded to include all grades and now there is a K-8 gifted population at the school.&nbsp; But the school itself has never been a k-8 school.&nbsp; The reason why it is the only middle school in district 30 that is solely for the gifted population is because it is a Middle School that was created for the district&#039;s gifted students.<br />Furthermore, I don&#039;t know why anyone would be in favor of destroying a successful program.&nbsp; It is one of the top middle schools in NY State and out performs other gifted programs throughout the city.&nbsp; <br />By changing the school to a k-8 school, the population would increase greatly - leading to overcrowding.&nbsp; As a parent of a young child, I don&#039;t know if I would want to send my preschooler or kindergartener to a school with 500 middle school students.&nbsp; <br />PS 122 is a great elementary school.&nbsp; The Academy for the Intellectually Gifted at 122 is a successful program.&nbsp; Let&#039;s preserve both the elementary school and the most successful gifted middle school program this city has.&nbsp;

				I&#039;m just finding out about this and can&#039;t believe it!&nbsp; Another point I don&#039;t think anyone brought up was that moving the gifted middle school classes to IS 126 might be a problem.&nbsp; When we were looking at middle school options for my child, I visited the school and talked to other parents and it is not a very good school - in fact it is downright dangerous.&nbsp; <br /><br />I hope this doesn&#039;t offend anyone, but I wouldn&#039;t send my child to a gifted program if it was housed in 126.&nbsp; You might think that they won&#039;t have to interact with the &#039;general population&#039; but I know of more than one kid who was bullied at lunch time and gym when the kids are put together.&nbsp; And I don&#039;t mean name calling, I mean punched in the face and choked.&nbsp; <br /><br />However I will say that that was 3 years ago and at the time a new principal had come in who seemed sincere in trying to turn the school around.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s gotten any better, but the safety factor is something to think hard about.<br />

				Norm- the info I posted was from a SLT(School Leadership Team) PS 122 board member - <br />I&#039;m not sure if the DOE has posted it on the web. I was notified via email from the CEC30, the principal @ PS122 sent home letters to all parents as well.<br />The changes were a SHOCK to the principal and the CEC30. The public is welcomed and encouraged to attend CEC30 meetings. They are held once a month at different schools in the District.<br /><br /><br />as far as Success Academy- as side from the posting by laseaux- there have been people with a petition for the school at the Ditmars stop for over a month. I have not run into them anywhere else in Astoria. The stated intent to open, the petitioners and the school changes are making people nervous.<br />I will try to find more answers for you. I strongly suggest you attend the Emergency meeting. The school has scheduled this emergency meeting because the changes are happening SO FAST<span style="font-size: 0.7em;" class="bbc_size">.</span><br />The following is a response to a post on dnainfo (they have done a great job reporting on school issues not found elsewhere) it gives a great history of the school..<br />&nbsp;<strong>Nigel McKenna</strong> (http://www.facebook.com/nigel.mckenna) · Executive Estate Manager (http://www.facebook.com/pages/Executive-Estate-Manager/198530310161344) at Stephen A. Schwarzman (http://www.facebook.com/pages/Stephen-A-Schwarzman/111145798904136)<br />Success Academy gets a 15% management fee on school expenses. If an average school has 400 enrollments and the operating cost is $13,500 per pupil (400X13,500 = $5,400,000) X 15% management fee = $810,000 to Eva Moskowitz’s Corporate Office. <br /><br /><br />NYC DOE notified PS 122Mamie Fay in Astoria, Queens last week that they plan to remove the 30 year old Gifted &amp; Talented program by 2019 to a different school in Long Island City, making that school an all chartered school. It is obvious that someone in the DOE is getting paid off to make this happen. Why would anyone destroy a district to gentrify one neighborhood? PS 122Mamie Fay School is not only one of the best schools in NYC &amp; NYS; it is also a flagship school. <br /><br /><br />For about 30 years now The Academy for the Intellectually Gifted, which is located inside P.S. 122 (21-21 Ditmars Blvd), has produced some of New York&#039;s brightest minds. The numbers speak for themselves. Over 90% of these kids attend schools such as Stuyvesant H.S., Bronx H.S. of Science, Hunter College H.S., Townsend Harris, and Bard H.S Early College. Almost all get into screened program. It is important to note that the vast majority of these students come from immigrant families that are either low or lower middle income households.<br /><br /><br />Much can be said about The Academy&#039;s track record. However, in our times, the city loves to talk about &quot;data&quot;, so we&#039;ll share a couple of hard data points so you can get an even better picture. If you look at the top ten middle schools in NYC, The Academy at 122 is the only one where 100% of the students meet or exceed the standards in English Language Arts and Mathematics. Also, it is the only school where 100% of the kids get to take high school courses and 100% of them actually receive credit for those courses. In other words, when it comes to high school readiness, The Academy is doing an amazing job. <br /><br /><br />As a result of the aforementioned successes, the Department of Education has decided on phasing out this outstanding and time tested school. Starting next year, any incoming kindergarten student will be allowed to stay through grade 8 despite the fact that the building at 21-21 Ditmars Blvd has never been a K-8 school. At the same time, the number of Academy classes will have to shrink from 11 to 3! Additionally, the building&#039;s population will increase by at least 50% which will have a severe impact on programs such as Art, Health, Dance, etc. As one member of the Community Education Council 30 pointed out, this will also mean that kids at 122 will have to start eating lunch at around 9:30 A.M. due to the scheduling nightmare that will be created. In other words, this will be a disaster for all children, whether they are in the gifted program or not. <br /><br /><br />We need everyone&#039;s help with trying to stop this monstrosity. This is bad for our community in so many ways. However, another Community Education Council member made a great point. By forcibly converting the 122 building into a K-8, and ostensibly killing the gifted program there, the local Junior H.S., 141 on 23rd avenue, will lose a great number of students. The extra space that will be created there is actually just the right amount for a charter school opening. What a surprise. <br /><br /><br />This point is re-iterated by another gentleman, John Collins, who is a Queens College professor. This is yet another example of NYC politicians closing off educational opportunities for middle class NYers by privatizing public education...they&#039;re trying to clear a space for a charter school at IS141...it&#039;s pretty obvious. As an educator and former 122 parent I can say clearly that right now 122 does perhaps the best job of preparing non-elite students for NYC&#039;s specialized high schools. By destroying our Academy they&#039;re simply reserving seats for Manhattan&#039;s elite...and they&#039;re doing it by hitting the kids early in life so they have no chance to catch up or learn what the masters of the universe have the $$ to buy. Sad. But that&#039;s our city today. No wonder middle class people leave Astoria/Jackson Heights/LIC for the suburbs...<br /><br /><br />School Background: <br />Based on the 2012, NY State Math &amp; ELA test results, PS 122 Mamie Fay is Astoria is has a grade A student performance rate. The P.S. 122 Mamie Fay has a very Popular Gifted &amp; Talented program and an extremely successful middle school with creative instruction and projects for all students. P.S. 122 is a neighborhood school drawn from the district and to a highly selective middle school called The Academy. With almost 1,400 students, the school is large, but teachers and staff pay keen attention to student needs which include classes for English language learners and special education services. <br /><br /><br />PS 122Mamie Fay School is located in a working class section of Astoria amid well-kept row houses and trendy eateries and shops. The school&#039;s early 20th century red brick building is clean and well-maintained. The school is affiliated with Columbia University&#039;s Teachers College (TC), follows its writing curriculum, and gets support from TC staff developers. Beginning in kindergarten, students write and revise multiple drafts of nonfiction, realistic fiction, and memoirs. The school uses the same curriculum for its G&amp;T and general education classes. <br />Beyond core academics and gym, elementary grade students enjoy art and music classes. Fifth graders take ballroom dancing. Middle school students take art, dance, music, and health classes and enjoy weekly clubs such as theater, art, music and gardening.<br /><br /><br />Please consider helping us with this fight.

				I know all the G&amp;T parents at 122 are up in arms about this, but I&#039;ve spoken to quite a few of my friends with kids in regular ed and they are really excited about being able to keep their kids there till grade 8. This looks like it is going to be a nasty battle and lines are going to be drawn.

				On the surface, I&#039;m sure it looks good to GenEd parents - but the reality is that if the enrollment is increased in the way it will be if the school becomes a &quot;zoned&quot; middle school,&nbsp; the GenEd kids will be forced into additional lunch periods, more crowded classrooms, loss of science and computer rooms, etc.<br />&nbsp;<br />It will not be the same middle school at all.&nbsp; :sad: <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;

				@domenica PLEASE encourage your friends to attend tomorrow nights meeting. This issue isn&#039;t G&amp;T vs. Gen Ed. <br /><br /><br />Ms. Sabel (the principal of 122) tearfully spoke at the CEC30 meeting stating how this will effect <strong><span class="bbc_u">ALL</span></strong> students. She discussed overcrowding, early lunches,<br />loss of labs and other spaces... <br /><br /><br />Parents fighting for more G&amp;T seats in D30 were NOT asking for them in PS122. This is a large district and the seats could be found elsewhere. <br />We were holding the DOE to their own words:<br />&nbsp;&quot;We strive to create more G&amp;T seats around the city, — if there is enough demand among qualifying students,&quot; said Devon Puglia, a DOE spokesman.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I wouldn&#039;t give the letter grades much weight.&nbsp; They measure improvement, not actual performance.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s better to look at the whole Accountability and Overview Report (http://www.astorians.com/community/javascript:checkExtLink(&#039;https://reportcards.nysed.gov/files/2010-11/AOR-2011-343000010122.pdf&#039;,&#039;&#039;);) report - found on the statistics page for each school.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Which isn&#039;t to say that 141 isn&#039;t a good school - from everything I&#039;m told - it is.&nbsp; It&#039;s just that the school letter grades don&#039;t tell the whole story.

				Hi folks, <br /><br />I attended the meeting on Wednesday night and am behind you 100%.&nbsp; It isn&#039;t about Gifted and Talented vs. General Education - it&#039;s about keeping an incredibly effective K-5 school that provides students with a rock solid foundation for their futures.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />PS 122Q reminds me very much of my childhood K-5 elementary school in New Jersey - a warm, safe space where my classmates and I learned how to be creative, caring, curious, compassionate and collaborative.&nbsp; Those dispositions were nurtured by the caring teachers of my youth and are central to who I am as an adult. (Don&#039;t get me wrong - my love of reading, writing, programming, math, social studies, trumpet playing and science were also nurtured in elementary school!) <br /><br />Cutting the science labs, computer lab, library and art room are unacceptable, especially in this day and age where STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) education and the development of critical thinking, reading and writing skills are vital to future success no matter what field a student goes into.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />My overall idea, which I&#039;m putting out there for anyone to use and expand upon, is to fight data with data. The PowerPoint slide with the 102% capacity vs. 129% capacity needs to be expanded upon and supported by detailed data collection, hopefully before the CEC 30 meeting on March 21st.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Questions I have after the meeting: <br /><br />-Why does Chancellor Walcott believe students should have the right to go K-8 at the same school? <br />-What peer-reviewed academic and quantitative research informed the NYC DOE decision?<br />-Where else has this happened in NYC? <br />-Does the DOE realize one size doesn&#039;t fit all communities?<br />-Isn&#039;t there some cognitive and developmental growth that takes place when students move to a new school?<br /><br />I was shocked to hear that the DOE has not visited the school to see how space (including the reading room in the closet mentioned during the public comment period) at PS 122 is used. This is where I see the biggest opportunity to make a strong case to the DOE: their data about PS 122Q is old and doesn&#039;t reflect the 102% capacity of the building. (I&#039;m also thinking about the teacher who mentioned she has 10 students in a classroom designed/slotted for 8.)&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />-What is the NYC DOE Blue Book? <br />-What types of data does it contain? <br />-How old is that data? <br />-What was the methodology used to collect and analyze the data?&nbsp; <br />-Can the parents of PS 122 in particular and other schools come up with a data collection tool and method to <br />ascertain when and how classrooms are used? <br /><br />Here&#039;s what I&#039;m thinking: a floorplan of each room (including labs, library, cafeteria and gymnasium) with the placement of furniture and other classroom components. <br /><br />The floorplan would be paired with a logbook that records four pieces of data:<br />-time of day(in ten minute increments) This recording would begin the moment the school is opened and end when the afterschool program ends for the day. <br />-number of adults in the room<br />-number of kids in the room<br />-type of activity (example: 4th grade science lesson, 2nd grade science lab/microscopes) <br />-photos (of the empty classroom/spaces - no kids) would accompany the data for each room/space. <br /><br />This data would then be compared to the Blue Book data/benchmarks, perhaps through some sort of data visualization or graphic design. <br /><br />-What triggers an Educational Impact Study (EIS)? <br />-What are the components of an EIS?<br />-How can PS 122 parents and others conduct a fair EIS equivalent? <br /><br />-We need to find and have access to the data the NYC DOE uses. What are the enrollment trends here in District 30? <br />-What about with PS 122 and the other schools here in Astoria? <br />-Why was 2019 chosen as the implementation date? Six years is around the corner. <br />-We need to find out the DOE methodology and, if applicable, the algorithms used to predict enrollment. <br /><br />-We also need to find out as many details as possible about their decision making process. What is their timeline? Who is involved and how? What is the process by which decisions are made?&nbsp; What are the checks and balances in place? Where is the transparency? <br /><br />-We need to connect with schools in Brooklyn that have had this happen to them. I&#039;m thinking about this article in the Village Voice:&nbsp; <br />http://www.villagevoice.com/2013-01-30/news/Eva-Moskowitz-Bloomberg-Charter-Schools/ (http://www.villagevoice.com/2013-01-30/news/Eva-Moskowitz-Bloomberg-Charter-Schools/)<br /><br />-We can also look here for background/ideas: <br />http://www.villagevoice.com/related/to/Success+Academy/ (http://www.villagevoice.com/related/to/Success+Academy/)<br /><br />Finally, we need to explore the possible decision to make PS 122 a K-8 school in relation to two things: the Success Academy letter of intent<br />for District 30 and the plans for new housing along the waterfront in Hallets Cove (26th Ave and 1st Street).&nbsp; Is the DOE&#039;s decision influenced by those two issues? <br /><br />I hope this helps! <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />

Notify parents of these impending disclosures and provide them with the right to consent before their child’s information is shared;<br />2. Hold public hearings to explain the point of these disclosures, and hear the concerns of parents &amp; privacy experts about how this plan risks children’s privacy, security and safety;<br />3. Explain how families can obtain relief if their children are harmed by the improper use or accidental release of this information, including who will be held financially responsible;<br />4. Pledge that the privacy rights of public school children and their families will be respected over the interests of the Gates Foundation, inBloom Inc., News Corp, or any other company or organization.<br /><strong>Therefore Be It Further Resolved</strong> that NYS Education Department &amp; NYC DOE remove all personal identifying information, including but not limited to name, address, OSIS number, social security number, and parent name, from data records shared with organizations outside the Department of Education, except in situations that are directly related to the individual child and where the Department of Education has secured the parent or guardian&#039;s permission, in writing, for said sharing of information.<br /><strong>Therefore Be It Further Resolved</strong> that we urge our state and local elected representatives to help us protect our children’s privacy and to ensure that parents are provided with full notification and the right to consent before any disclosures occur.<br /><strong>RESOLUTION #94</strong><br /><strong>Calling for a moratorium on all school closures, phase-outs and </strong><br /><strong>charter school co-locations</strong><br />WHEREAS, the New York City Department of Education has issued Proposals for Significant Changes in School Utilization and Educational Impact Statements (EIS) for our schools that will, upon approval of the Panel for Educational Policy, dissolve schools, some with a proud history of achievements and neighborhood connections; and<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;WHEREAS, while the closing of a school may be necessary as a last resort, school closure has increasingly and improperly become the first and only policy employed by the DOE to address schools with large numbers of students with significant educational needs; and<br />WHEREAS, in hearings and meetings held subsequently, it has become clear that the Mayor&#039;s school improvement strategy may de-stabilize thousands of students in primarily large, comprehensive high schools, and - the replacement of teachers and principals according to rigid and fundamentally arbitrary criteria without offering ample professional development opportunities - penalize the very people who have made significant improvements in several schools; and<br /><br />WHEREAS, the policy of school closures affects disproportionately students of color and communities affected by these policies in NYC have filed a Federal Title VI Civil Rights complaint with the U.S. Department of Education Office of Civil Rights, citing the closing of schools and the criteria and methods for administering those actions as discriminatory toward low-income, minority communities ; and<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;WHEREAS, charter schools were originally intended as pedagogical laboratories for innovation in teaching to better meet the needs of all our students, but particularly those at-risk, and to improve public schools by collaborating with public schools and sharing best practices with public schools; and<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;WHEREAS, many charter schools in the City today are not pedagogical laboratories for educational <br />innovation, do not serve students at-risk, and neither collaborates nor share best practices with public schools; and<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;WHEREAS, some charter schools have discharged struggling students to improve school-wide test scores; and <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;WHEREAS, some charter schools have impaired parent participation by blocking the formation of parent-teacher or parent associations; and<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;WHEREAS, resources available to students in NYC public schools should be used to address the educational needs of public school students, rather than supplement the budgets of the large charter management chains which have accumulated substantial assets through both public funds and their unrestricted ability to accept private funding; and<br />&nbsp;<br />WHEREAS, public school communities seeking to expand successful schools are routinely denied that opportunity by the DOE due to a purported lack of space for such expansion; and<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;WHEREAS, opposition to charter school co-locations is increasingly widespread amongst parents, teachers, elected officials, community leaders and members of the clergy as evidenced by demonstrations, petitions, public comment at hearings and litigation to block co-locations. <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that Community District Education Council 30 supports a moratorium on all school closures, phase-outs and charter school co-locations and calls upon Chancellor Walcott to: <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;1. Withdraw all current proposals up for vote by the Panel for Educational Policy for Significant Changes in School Utilization. <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;2. Impose a moratorium on all school proposals until public presentations are made in every borough reflecting on how this method will raise student achievement in lieu of existing models. <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;3. Conduct school-by-school transparent reviews of current school improvement strategies to assess which measures and programs have been effective or are showing promise in raising student achievement, while improving the school environment; these transparent reviews should include all stakeholders. <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;4. Examine school intervention plans that maybe in place, bearing in mind those improvement strategies contemplate multiyear plans and that none of the schools may have exceeded the time allowed under the federal guidelines. <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;5. Ensure that all struggling schools, whether or not they are undergoing federally specified reform <br /><br /><br />plans, are given adequate support so that the students will not only graduate but receive the quality of education that will make them college- or career- ready. <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;6. Provide a full accounting as well facilitate independent research of the educational outcomes of students remaining in previously phased out schools. <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;7. Fully cooperate with any investigation of Title VI civil rights complaints as filed with US DOE Office of Civil Rights. <br />&nbsp;
