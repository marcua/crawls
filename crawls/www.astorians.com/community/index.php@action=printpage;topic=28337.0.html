We’ll do one or two writing exercises per night, based on short texts and interactive prompts, which can be adapted for poetry or prose. We’ll also allot time for you to read the results of the exercises (if you so choose) in order to receive supportive responses from the group. The Studio can give you an introduction to creative writing, a means to experiment creatively, a regular space to generate material, an entry into a project and/or a means to share your writing in community.<br /><strong><br />To register:</strong> Please email nancyagabian@yahoo.com at least 48 hours in advance of your first session and 1) describe your experience with writing and 2) identify the rate that you can pay.<br /><br />&nbsp; ________________<br /><strong>Book Writers’ Group</strong><br /><br />12 Tuesday nights, 7:30 – 9:30 pm<br /><br />September 9 – December 9<br /><br />in Jackson Heights, Queens<br /><br />Limited to 8 members<br /><br />$300<br /><br />For writers working on long-term or book length projects, this workshop will focus on craft issues of structure, plot, voice, character development and other elements that sustain a reader’s interest for a few hundred pages. With input from members, we’ll decide on three to six books to read over the course of the workshop, discussing each book for its successful strategies of melding content and style; members will then discuss approaches and formulate goals to adapt this knowledge to the writing of their project. Each member will receive critique two to three times over the course of the workshop, on chapters or excerpts up to 20 pages long. Part book group, seminar, and critique workshop, the Book Writers’ Group will give you an audience of readers to help nurture and develop your memoir, short story collection, or novel.<br /><br /><strong>To apply:</strong> please email nancyagabian@yahoo.com two paragraphs that 1) explain your interest and/or experience in contributing to a writing community (i.e., why would you be a successful member of this writing group?) and 2) describe your writing goals and the project you would like to work on with this group.
