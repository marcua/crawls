				MARTIN D. HILL playwright &amp; THE REALLY CHRISTIAN BROADCASTING NETWORK presents<br />“Interfaith Understanding with the Rev. Bill and Betty” <strong>Astoria&#039;s Jen Ryan and Rik Sansone<br />as part of FringeNYC 2010<br /></strong><br />Thurs 8/19 @ 9pm &nbsp;-- &nbsp; &nbsp;Monday 8/23 @ 3:15pm -- Thurs 8/26 @ 7pm &nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Fri 8/27 @ 2pm &nbsp;-- Sunday 8/29 @1:45pm<br /><br />ROBERT MOSS THEATRE - 440 Lafayette Street, 3rd &nbsp;Floor - New York, NY 10003<br />(Subway: #6 to Astor Place, N/R to 8th Street)<br /><br />&nbsp;$15 tickets @ www.fringenyc.org or $18 at the door<br /><br />AS SEEN ON NBC’S “LAST COMIC STANDING”<br />starring Fringe NYC Outstanding Performance Award Winner Jen Ryan<br /><br />“Ironic...really funny...and they get away with it” - Greg Giraldo, Judge - NBC’S Last Comic Standing<br />“...like old time-y Southern baptists on acid” - TVSquad.com<br />&quot;They&#039;ll smite you with uncontrollable laughter&quot; - NY Variety Show Examiner.com<br /><br />PRAISE THE LORD! &nbsp;&quot;Interfaith Understanding with Rev. Bill and Betty&quot; will be making its full-length debut at the New York International Fringe Festival in August. Pretzel logic, intolerance, and misunderstanding make the Rev. Bill and Betty America&#039;s most outrageous preachers! Set during their weekly syndicated show from Tungsten, Tennessee, Rev. Bill and Betty explore the “strange and unusual practices of non-Christians”-- in other words, everyone who isn’t them. &nbsp;Rev. Bill and Betty are hell-bent on “converting all of America into the South through the use of global warming”; warning viewers about the “heavy metal sounds of Justin Bieber” and of course, our current President -- “a Hawaiian terrorist.” Rev. Bill says it best: “If we wrote up a list of all of the people that should be condemned, that list would be longer than the Bible.” Interfaith Understandings are never mean-spirited, but are instead sharp social and political satire.<br /><br />Rev. Bill and Betty were featured on the current season of NBC’S “Last Comic Standing”. They have performed “Interfaith Understandings” at the Broadway Comedy Club, the Laugh Factory, Under St. Marks, Gene Frankel, The Slipper Room, The Kraine, Sweet Caroline’s, and at numerous charity benefits in New York City. &nbsp;<br /><br />JEN RYAN (AEA/Betty, Co-Author) won the FRINGENYC Outstanding Performance Award in 2004 for “The Imaginary All-True Leni Riefenstahl Show”, which she also authored. NY Credits include: Wrapped (NYMF), Tartuffe, PUNCH 59 Sketch Comedy. www.jenryan.com<br /><br />RIK SANSONE (AEA/Bill, Co-Author) last appeared in FringeNYC in “The Imaginary All-True Leni Riefenstahl Show” where he played over 40 characters. &nbsp;He is a published artist and graphic designer. www.riksgraphiks.com<br /><br />MARTIN D. HILL (Creator/Author) is a playwright who created Rev. Bill and Betty over fifteen years ago. Martin is an assistant professor of pharmacology at the Ponce School of Medicine. www.someoneexactlylikeme.com<br /><br />LEONARD JACOBS (Director) is the founder &amp; editor of The Clyde Fitch Report, the nexus of arts and politics. He has covered arts and culture (and in and around the theater) for 20 years. It&#039;s a blessing! www.clydefitch.com<br /><br />www.revbillandbetty.com &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;facebook.com/revbillandbetty &nbsp; &nbsp; Twitter: revbillandbetty<br /><br />&nbsp;# &nbsp;# &nbsp;#<br /><br />
