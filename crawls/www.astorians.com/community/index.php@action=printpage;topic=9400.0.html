				I&#039;m always wondering what the soup of the day is at Il Bambino.&nbsp; Their site is down and they don&#039;t have a regular soup schedule so I propose this thread.&nbsp; I&#039;ll call everyday, find out what the soup is and post it here.&nbsp; I think all the soups at Il Bambino are delicious.&nbsp; They all come with crostinis and are a comforting and hearty meal. <br /><br />Il Bambino :smitten:<br />34-08 31st Avenue (Between 33rd and 34th Street)<br />Astoria, NY 11106<br />Phone: (718) 626-0087<br /><br />Hours:<br />Sun 8am-9pm<br />Mon-Sat 8am-10:30pm <br /><br />Others can feel free to call and post it as well.&nbsp; This can be the place people look before ordering.&nbsp; I consider this my public service to the Astorian community.&nbsp; &nbsp;:mrgreen:<br /><br />Today&#039;s soup is:<br /><strong><br />Maple butternut squash with cinnamon.&nbsp; <br /></strong><br />Oh, man, that sounds good. <br /><br />&nbsp; <br />(http://www.550soup-recipes.com/soup.gif)<br />(Artist rendition.&nbsp; Your soup may or may not have hearts floating out of it.)<br />

				Does anyone know if the soups that DON&#039;T have meat right there in the title, are vegetarian? There aren&#039;t a lot of places in Astoria that serve vegetarian soups (please correct me if I&#039;m wrong), and some of these sound really tasty.

				Went here for the first time this Saturday and the tomato bisque was the best soup I have ever had. I was talking about it all weekend. Creamy and just incredibly good- a good sized bowl and some incredible toasted garlicky bread came with it. Paninis were phenomenal as well. This place is fantastic!

				Finally had a chance to try Il Bambino tonight when BF* suggested &quot;a hole-in-the-wall Italian place.&quot; He started with the tomato lentil parsnip soup** w/pesto crustini, and he was impressed. <br /><br />We then moved on to crustini sandwiches: Me, the mushroom/tomato pesto/asiago cheese; he the basil/tomato/mozzarella. He saved half for lunch tomorrow.<br /><br />Had decaf cappuccinos for dessert. <br /><br />Music was also excellent: Vintage Who; mellow Clash; a David Bowie song I never heard before; John Lee Hooker.....&nbsp; :mrgreen: :mrgreen:<br /><br />* His favorite stupid joke: &quot;Oh, look, they have Soup du Jour. I hear it&#039;s excellent.&quot; Told him that in this place, that&#039;s not a joke, the Soup du Jour <em>is</em> excellent.<br /><br />** that&#039;s today&#039;s soup BTW.....ah too late they&#039;re closed&nbsp; :roll:

				I did indeed get the soup. It was my first time going there on my way to work. I took the train down two stops and walked over there from the subway. The weather sucked and there was some messy construction going on 31st Ave, but it was a worthwhile purchase and the soup was quite delicious. So was the bread that came with it, though the bread oil had leaked through the paper take-out bag by the time I got to work. It did not lessen my soup experience, however. I still have soup left over. Trying to decide if I should eat it tonight or leave it until tomorrow. I think I might have to eat it tonight, just because it&#039;s there.<br /><br />This was the roasted root vegetables picture I was going to post:<br />(http://images.jupiterimages.com/common/detail/85/35/23033585.jpg)<br /><br />Oh, and I discovered today that they sell cupcakes from Crumbs bakery there. Those things are ridiculous.

				^^ Good idea.&nbsp; Or chocolate egg soup.&nbsp; <br /><br />Maybe the potato, coming from the ground, symbolizes the earth, from which God made Adam, the cauliflower symbolizes little trees, symbolizing where the serpent lived when he offered Eve forbidden fruit, thus creating a need for Jesus to save humanity from original sin, and the thyme sounds like &quot;time&quot; which symbolizes that Jesus rose from the dead after a certain amount of time.&nbsp; <br /><br />Basically, there is no better Easter-themed soup than potato, cauliflower and thyme.&nbsp; <br /><br />Happy Easter!

				I&#039;ve had the soup there twice lately. The first time was a pumpkin, apple, and rosemary soup, which was so phenomenal that we ordered an extra two soups to take home with us. Unfortunately they said pumpkin season generally ends at the end of October and he would not likely be making that soup past that time since the quality of the pumpkins becomes too variable. The second time was the always delicious white bean soup.
