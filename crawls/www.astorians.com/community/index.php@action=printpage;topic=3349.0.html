				I visited the Matrix, but it seems like overkill. All I want is a treadmill for when it gets cold, and maybe some free weights. A special-deal for couples would be awesome, too. Is there any such gym in the Ditmars area?

				Not true! Fitness Point gym is dirt cheap. Granted its not located near Ditmars and a lot of the machines are broken... but none the less it is cheap! My one year membership was $249. (Located at 34 Avenue between 28th and Crescent).<br /><br />Ahhhh.... if I had some extra cash how I would love to join Crunch!!

				I believe my membership to Dolphin (i know, bad name) in between 30th and Broadway on 31st Street is ~$40 a month.&nbsp; i pay about 6mo. in advance.

				Just to weigh in...<br />I go to NYSC and pay WAY too much but I love it and the ppl there (the staff not the members) are so nice.&nbsp; Some times it is worth it to have a clean place to work out where you know you can shoer b4 work and not get some awful disease

				I go to Matrix and it doesn&#39;t seem like overkill to me. In fact, I only went there for the treadmills at first. I think the staff is pretty friendly. And even though there are some hardcore gym junkies who go there, there are also plenty of normal people who go. Everyone I&#39;ve encountered from both categories have been really nice. The gym&#39;s even incredibly clean. I suggest you try their free two-week trial and see for yourself. They didn&#39;t put any pressure on us when we did, so you don&#39;t have to worry about the hard sell.

We&#39;re trying their two-week deal until we either decide to go there or find somewhere else to go. ASC seems really cheap, but it&#39;s a good walk down Steinway: Matrix gets double points for convenience.<br /><br />Do you know how much I was paying back in Tennesse? 22 bucks a month.

We originally decided to go there instead of The Rock because it&#39;s only about a block away from home. I figured it&#39;d take away at least one major excuse that I use all the time. Little did I know how determined I was not to go to the gym at first. Luckily, they have four TV stations on at all times, so I can practice being a couch potato and running 5K at the same time. If they made treadmills or bikes with video games and/or Web access, I&#39;d be all set.

Crazy!<br /><br />I&#39;m still praying for a Planet Fitness to come to Astoria. $15/month! (Although, I&#39;d probably spring for the $20 &quot;Black Card&quot; Membership, just so I could go to any branch - there is one around the corner from my parent&#39;s house, and I&#39;m up there at least a couple times a month.)<br />

				Each borough has a rec center, might not be convenient enough but they&#39;re cheap as hell. If you work in the city, you could even sign up for that one&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				Any women out there tried out dolphin gym on 31st street/31st ave?&nbsp; It is so so very close to home, but I noticed some disco lights in the staircase and only a, errrrr, predominate meathead demographic walking in.&nbsp; I&#39;m not terribly interested in a singles-bar gym.&nbsp; But maybe it isn&#39;t? <br />Was thinking about lucille roberts on steinway - but will I go when there is snow on the ground? I can&#39;t be sure.<br />thanks!<br />
