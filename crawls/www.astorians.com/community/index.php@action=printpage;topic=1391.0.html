				So, I am about to increase my mileage in my running.&nbsp; Currently, I find that after running about 3 miles each morning I go out, I am lacking energy after I eat breakfast.&nbsp; I eat yoghurt with grains and some coffee for breakfast post-running.&nbsp; This is <strong>not</strong> enough to sustain me.&nbsp; I get famished about 3 hours after I eat and sometimes a bit irritable (low blood sugar).&nbsp; Anyway, I am searching for nutritious foods to eat, most likely high in (meatless) protein or at least balanced with carbohydrates, that I can prepare quickly and that won&#39;t screw with my blood sugar.&nbsp; Do you have any suggestions?&nbsp;

				Megc,<br /><br />You might try adding some fruit/nuts in the mix for the inbetween meal times.&nbsp; I know I have this crazy hungry every few hours thing going on so I try to offset by &quot;healthy snacks&quot;.<br /><br />Also eating a little protein with your carbs (and a little fat) may be a good idea.<br /><br />Toast + egg + yogurt = yum (ok, not all mushed up together mind you)<br /><br />Anyway, let me know what you come up with!<br /><br />cheers,<br />jayme

				I usually take a baggie of good breakfast cereal with me as a snack if I get hungry during the day- something like Puffins or Cheerios- tasty and not too sweet or messy. <br />

				Thanks, jayme, firelight, and anzubird for all your suggestions!&nbsp; This morning I had coffee, and a bowl of malt-o-meal with raw pecans, dried currants, some maple syrup and soymilk.&nbsp; That was definitely better than it&#39;s been.&nbsp; I bet some sliced bananas would be good on it, too.&nbsp;

				hey meg-- i would go with the egg option (if you&#39;re not vegan, etc).. a hard boiled egg alongside your hot cereal should so the trick.&nbsp; No additional sugar means no crashing a few hours later. Try looking to the mystic Far East: the japanese eat a bowl of rice, egg, scallions, and natto (bonito) as a typical breakfast. That sounds yummier than the usual &#39;breakfasto americano&#39; to me (and brown rice is a good twist)<br /><br />buena suerte!

				I&#39;ll think more about the egg.&nbsp; I wonder how one could make tamago?&nbsp; That sweet egg sushi, you know?&nbsp; In the Japanese vein, I also used to eat a snack of soft tofu topped with freshly grated ginger, scallions, tamari, and sesame oil.&nbsp; It was good!&nbsp; I bet it would be good for breakfast.

				I think adding nuts is a good idea. I tend to eay a soy nut, almond, dried cranberry &quot;trail mix&quot; to fight off mid-morning hunger pains.
