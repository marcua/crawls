				I have either been out of town or cooking a lot lately, so I think it&#039;s something like this, going from most recent backwards:<br /><br />Mama Carmellas: Both the Crostini and the Fresh Mozz and marinara pizzas<br />Dillingers: Buffalo Chicken Wrap with Onion Rings and Fries (and beer!)<br />One of the cheap-o Mexican delivery places: chicken tortillas, because I was craving them and feeling lazy (it&#039;s a very specific craving, not unlike that for chef boyardee)<br />Some bad Chinese place: chicken lo-mein and white rice, because I was playing nurse for the girlfriend, and feeling lazy, again, oh, and because Mei Jia was closed since it was late on a Sunday.<br />Tastee Corner: Egg and turkey on whole wheat for breakfast<br /><br />

				Revisiting this thread. This goes from most recent backwards:<br /><br />Sugarfreak: we just had snacks and drinks there last night. Everything was really good, especially the collard greens. The debris fries weren&#039;t as stellar as I was hoping, but I&#039;ll definitely be going back.<br />Fattys: Stopped in for lunch for the first time (it was the brunch menu, but whatever) last week while running wedding errands. Really good stuff. Kinda wish I hadn&#039;t slept on it for so long. <br />Queens Kickshaw: Went here for lunch a couple weeks ago. I love this place, and that kitchen sink salad is awesome.<br />Il Bambino: Had a meal at brunch time, but ate lunch foods, and I am amazed that not only does this place seem to stay consistent, but possibly gets better with age. <br />5 Napkin Burger: Went here after work one day, and spent the meal wishing we had gone to Sweet Afton or Bareburger instead. Not awful, but not worth what we paid.
