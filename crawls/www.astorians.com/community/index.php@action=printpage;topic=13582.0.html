				I have a business here in Astoria. Been using Astoria Federal for years but they been getting worse over time. Poor online banking system for starters.&nbsp; To their credit they are good at working with me at the personal level for my biz banking needs.<br /><br />Can anyone recommend a good bank in the area where they treat a small business owner well and not just as a tiny speck in their system?

				One problem is that so many of the banks with local branches have been taken over lately.&nbsp; I have an account for a non-profit at Washington Mutual, and I&#039;ve been very happy with their service - but of course they failed a few months ago and were taken over by Chase.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t noticed any changes yet, but I&#039;m sure they are coming, and I don&#039;t have any experience with Chase as a bank either for personal or business accounts.

				we are with capital one. started out with northfork and they were kind of meh, especially with online banking. however, with capital one we&#039;re very happy with the new online system. customer service is fine (not outstanding), especially since we really require very little customer service intervention.<br /><br />that said, we own a design business and don&#039;t have the more demanding banking needs of retail. not sure what type of business you own but if you are looking for low key and no hassle i would recommend capital one.
