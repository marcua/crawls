				I am interested in compiling a list of nearby places that are fun places to visit.&nbsp; Whether it be weekend getaways or day trips.&nbsp; Perhaps the good members of the board would like to share their experiences.<br /><br />I have been up to Hunter and found the snow tubing to be a lot of fun.&nbsp; Not too far away and not too expensive either.&nbsp; There was a nice trail to hike on along the way.&nbsp; Just stopped by the side of the road in a little area where we could pull over and took a hike.&nbsp; Very nice trip.<br /><br />Hook a brother up with what you do when you get away.

Very nice and peaceful after the summer (even relatively quiet during the summer) - and good hiking trails.<br /><br />I took a day trip to Cold Spring not long ago - you can take Metro North there. Very pretty, and also good hiking trails and kayaking. It&#39;s a cute town, lots of antique shops, etc. <br /><br />I like this thread- I&#39;m always looking for ideas for short trips!

				Cold Spring is very nice, also New Palz and the Mohonk Mountain House<br /><br />If you feel like driving a little farther, Mystic is a really nice place too... the thing to do is to get there in before labor day and go to Abbot&#39;s Lobsters in the Rough in Noank for lobster. <br /><br />

				Jim and I recently ended up in Beacon for the weekend.&nbsp; Great town, a lot of hiking, shopping and eating in the area.&nbsp; It&#39;s just north of Cold Spring, in fact.&nbsp; A lot of the main street in Beacon is brick row houses that have been renovated and have shops, galleries, coffee shops and restaurants.&nbsp; The second Saturday of every month a lot of the galleries stay open late, and have free wine and cheese while you browse, and several of the restaurants also have little discounts or a free glass of wine.&nbsp; There is also Dia:Beacon (http://www.diacenter.org/bindex.html), a renovated Nabisco factory that houses the art collection of the Dia Art Foundation from the 1960s to the present.

				Places I&#39;ve often recommended ...<br /><br /><em>On Long Island:</em><br />Cold Spring Harbor<br />Greenpoint<br />Montauk<br /><em><br />Upstate:</em><br />Catskills (several little towns in the area)<br />Saratoga Springs<br />Woodstock<br />Kingston<br />(actually most of the little towns along the Hudson, including Tarrytown, Rye, and Nyack)<br /><br /><em>Out of state (3-hour drive or less):</em><br />Delaware Water Gap<br />Mystic, CT<br />New Haven, CT<br />various towns in Litchfield County, CT (Lake Compounce! woo hoo!)<br />Norwalk, CT<br />Baltimore, MD<br />Block Island, RI<br />Rockport/Gloucester, MA<br />Lancaster County, PA<br /><br />I was just saying to JD that we had to set up a weekend in October for apple picking (and, yep, pumpkins, too ...&nbsp; :mrgreen:); could make it an all in one day, as Bear Mountain hikes are awesome (as are any upstate mountain hikes) -- usually go with my aunt &amp; uncle, who live up there, though, we tend to accidentally unearth (so to speak) very, very old cemeteries ...&nbsp; :-o

				One of the most relaxing places I know is New Hope, PA/Lambertville, NJ.&nbsp; It&#39;s very touristy, but I don&#39;t mind touristy.&nbsp; Quaint colonial-era houses, lots of trees, riverside inns, art galleries, a great bookstore with character.&nbsp; Good food--not great, but good.&nbsp; Waitresses who call you &quot;hon.&quot;&nbsp; There&#39;s not much to do at night unless you&#39;re a gay biker (no offense to any gay bikers on the board), but it&#39;s a nice place to depressurize.

				I like City Island a lot but I found it a bit of a pain to get to.&nbsp; If you have a car it&#39;s probably pretty easy.<br /><br />Once I randomly decided to take the train to Rye, NY just to get out of the city.&nbsp; I enjoyed it.&nbsp; It&#39;s just any old suburban town with a walkable downtown area.&nbsp; Nothing to do there.&nbsp; But if you just want a change of pace from the city, it&#39;s easy to get to and you can stroll around a bit.&nbsp; I even went back a couple years later.&nbsp; It&#39;s not a full-day but a nice two hours, anyway.

				Your inspired roving travel reporter is here to let you know that Newport, Rhode Island is well worth the visit.<br /><br />The travel time is about three hours and the scenery is quite lovely, especially as you approach the town. The seaside town has two interesting bridges which offer a spectacular view of a lot of open water with many water craft and real lighthouses.<br /><br />The town is a bit pricey, so not recommended for college or low budget types. Parking is a hassle, so be prepared to walk from a distant spot or pay for the parking garage near the water or an more expensive public lot.<br /><br />Lots of fun little shops to visit and some really incredible scenery. Lots of historical buildings if that is your thing. Plenty of water related activities in the appropriate season. Two of the biggest attractions are the famous mansions which can be toured for a fee or just be driven or walked by and ogled and the Cliff Walk which is three and a half miles of fantastic ocean front trail behind the mansions. It is quite a sight. For a really nice fancy meal, Castle Hill Inn is highly recommended.<br /><br />Overall, I give the place high marks and recommend it for a one or two day getaway.

				I think lanseaux mentioned Beacon as a nice destination, too.&nbsp; <br /><br />Wine tasting along the North Fork of LI, ending in Greenport is nice, too.&nbsp; I did that around this time of year when I first moved to Stony Brook.&nbsp; Orient Point, at the end of the North Fork, is cool because at one point, you can see the waves of the Peconic Bay intersect the waves of the Long Island Sound.&nbsp; I loved seeing that.&nbsp; As far as the Hamptons go, I don&#39;t find them to be such a big deal.&nbsp; What I have heard, though, is how nice Montauk State Park is at the very end tip of the South Fork.&nbsp; I&#39;ve been wanting to get out there for some time now.<br /><br />Port Jefferson is also a nice little place to check out on your way to the North Fork of LI.&nbsp; I used to go there all the time, as I lived in the village next to Port Jeff while in Grad school.&nbsp; It attracts a lot of visitors.&nbsp; If you decide to visit the Three Village area (Port Jefferson/Stony Brook/Setauket), let me know, as I lived there for 4 years!

				Orient Point is wonderful, I so much prefer the North Shore and the LI Sound part of the Island, and speaking of that ... I love Port Jeff!! I&#39;ve gone there a few times recently, used to spend lots of time there when I was kid when mom and I spent weeks out in Centereach with relatives. <br /><br />Montauk is really lovely, but it pretty much shuts down in the winter, I spent an evening there in March a few years ago, and while it was pretty, there&#39;s not a whole heck of a lot to do.<br /><br />Also thought of Cold Spring Harbor (on Long Island, not Cold Spring, upstate), they&#39;ve got a fish hatchery, a little museum, and cute shops and restaurants. Very short trip and a nice place to spend the afternoon.

				As a Long Island native I would have to agree with Duluoz Cat that Cold Spring Harbor and Port Jefferson are nice areas to visit on Long Island. I think the Hampton&#39;s are completely overrated.<br /><br />Another suggestion is Rockland County. It is so close- about a 45 minutes to 1 hour drive and it is absolutely beautiful up there. Nyack has art galleries, restaurants, shops and it has beautiful views of the Hudson River. I am dying to get up there again myself- especially now that the leave are changing.<br /><br />

				And as I recently discovered, the damn bus doesn&#39;t run as often as it should. I read that there was a bus that travels in a circle from train station to museum to other parts of the town. Unfortunately, I sat outside of the museum for nearly an hour with no luck. It&#39;s a good thing the main street (quite possibly called Main Street) is a 15-20 minute walk away. Just hope for good weather. We happened to be there on Beacon Day (or something), so the celebration on Main Street (?) was what held up the bus, I&#39;m guessing.<br /><br />I would have liked to have brought a car, though, since there were a lot of great antique shops and a car would have been handy for bringing stuff home.

				I grew up in Beacon, born there raised there, family still there. &nbsp;The Beacon you see now is not the Beacon I grew up in. &nbsp;It&#39;s going through a major art revolution of sorts, or you could call it gentrification. &nbsp; For someone whose grown up there, it&#39;s kinda funny to watch all the hubbub. &nbsp;I do wish I had had access to the art when I was in high school, we only had art class, no film no video etc. &nbsp;It&#39;s a beautiful city and the making of it into a tourist art mecca is a positive change, especially as far as image goes. &nbsp;At the same time, Beacon&#39;s always been pretty poor, Main Street wasn&#39;t and still isn&#39;t always the safest area of town, and jobs are very low-paying. &nbsp;Real estate has gone up as more and more city people can&#39;t afford Westchester, and Beacon&#39;s artsy makeover has made it more desirable, so there&#39;s a new influx of people (commuters to the city) and $500,000 mcmansions popping up all over. &nbsp;Most people who grew there and do not work in the city end up living together and find it hard to afford homes or apartments, a one-bedroom can go for $1000 on Main Street and you may only make $10-15/hour at your job. &nbsp;I wish there was more help given to the community to break the cycle of poverty that is so pervasive there (as in many cities).<br /><br />I used to say I would never go back. &nbsp;It was one of those places where you either stay, get married, and pop out the kids right away, or you move for something else. &nbsp;But going back now once a month to see my family, it&#39;s so interesting to see all the changes. &nbsp;All the nice restaurants and the cute little coffeehouses, all the art everywhere, it&#39;s amazing how it&#39;s changed so much. &nbsp;I&#39;m not quite ready to give myself a curfew by having to take Metronorth everyday but I don&#39;t mind recommending it to people now, and people actually have heard of the very small city I grew up in :)<br /><br />Oh and I wouldn&#39;t say the train station is mere feet from the Dia.&nbsp; Prepare to walk or hopefully you get a shuttle.&nbsp; And there are hills involved to get to Main Street.

				Oh, Daisy, allow me a little hyperbole.&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; But seriously, as I recall from my visit to Beacon late this summer, the two are very close, and quite walkable.&nbsp; From the Beacon website, here are the directions:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">To walk to Dia:Beacon from the train station, exit the rear of the platform on the river (west) side. Turn left on Red Flynn Drive and follow it over the railroad tracks to Beekman Street. Turn right at Beekman Street and continue to Dia:Beacon which is the next driveway on the right.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I can&#39;t quite get Google maps to work for me, but if you click here (http://maps.google.com/maps?q=3+Beekman+Street,+Beacon,+NY+12508&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=17&amp;ll=41.504231,-73.981494&amp;spn=0.004323,0.012188&amp;t=k&amp;om=1) and look for the split in the road to the left of the green arrow, the road that heads south off of the edge of the map is the driveway to Dia:Beacon.&nbsp; The Metro North station is at top on the left, next to the river.

				For all of us walkers, yeah, it&#39;s probably no problem. 10 minutes I would say, about one hill.&nbsp; Main Street on the other hand more like 15-20 depending on where you&#39;re coming from and how fast you walk uphill (it&#39;s a long hill).&nbsp; But I think there is a shuttle.<br /><br />For my parents and anyone else who grew up there, whenever they come to visit in the city, the 8 minute walk to my apartment and any other walking done in the city&nbsp; - it&#39;s tortuous. That&#39;s why they have cars in Beacon.<br /><br />Sorry, I forgot I was talking to a bunch of city folks for whom 10 minutes of walking is nothing&nbsp; :-D

				Thanks for all the suggestions, guys.&nbsp; So I&#39;ve scrapped the Hamptons idea, and now it&#39;s a matter of narrowing something down.&nbsp; If you guys were taking a day car trip, what&#39;s the one place you would pick out of all the ones mentioned and why?

				I would echo everything lanseaux says in the first paragraph.&nbsp; The rest of it sounds terrific, too, but I know very little about the food out there, but I&#39;m sure her suggestions are excellent.&nbsp; I&#39;d love to try some of these places next time I&#39;m out there.<br /><br />What is the name of the place that bills itself as the oldest continuously run restaurant by the same family?

However, I don&#039;t see a car as being necessary if you stay in the town proper. There was a bus stop where I saw at least 8 people waiting on a Sunday evening but I do not know which bus or where it goes. My best guess on the bus would be Greyhound.<br /><br />Assuming you can get there by bus and stay at one of the B&amp;Bs in town, I would say this would be a really nice Spring/Summer vacation spot for a couple days. Everything in the town is walkable and it looks like it will really gear up for visitors during warmer weather. Look to be more than a few interesting music venues and I can attest to a couple of really nice restaurants of moderate to expensive prices that are comparable to what is in Astoria. Lots of healthy new age type options for food and drink.<br /><br />Decided to look up the bus and yes, it is Greyhound and they have a station there:<br />Woodstock, New York<br /><br />Address<br />H HOUST &amp; SON HARDWARE<br />4 MILL HILL RD<br />Woodstock, NY 12498<br />Telephone Numbers<br />Main: 845-679-9313<br />Greyhound Charter: 800-454-2487<br /><br />Hours Of Operation<br />Hours of operation subject to change.
