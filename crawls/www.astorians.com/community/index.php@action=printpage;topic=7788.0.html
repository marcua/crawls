				http://salon.com/opinion/blumenthal/2007/09/06/bush_wmd/<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">On Sept. 18, 2002, CIA director George Tenet briefed President Bush in the Oval Office on top-secret intelligence that Saddam Hussein did not have weapons of mass destruction, according to two former senior CIA officers. Bush dismissed as worthless this information from the Iraqi foreign minister, a member of Saddam&#039;s inner circle, although it turned out to be accurate in every detail. Tenet never brought it up again. <br /><br />Nor was the intelligence included in the National Intelligence Estimate of October 2002, which stated categorically that Iraq possessed WMD. No one in Congress was aware of the secret intelligence that Saddam had no WMD as the House of Representatives and the Senate voted, a week after the submission of the NIE, on the Authorization for Use of Military Force in Iraq. The information, moreover, was not circulated within the CIA among those agents involved in operations to prove whether Saddam had WMD.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				^ <br />im not surprised, Bush knew alot of things before hand,&nbsp; just another lie, a way to get support for a war, all scare tactics imo,&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />weapons of mass destruction?, the u.s prob sold it to them years ago, like here when Rumsfield and Saddam met to do business, <br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whGndmvTjBc<br />

				it&#039;s not just that Bush knew. Not to say that what he did wasn&#039;t wrong, but I&#039;ve worked for people who disregarded information that would have, if taken seriously, required them to change a stance, admit they were wrong, and show that they had wasted an expensive investment. <br /><br />It&#039;s also that other people did know, and that information didn&#039;t get to other people who could have influenced the outcome - Colin Powell, Tony Blair, our senators. For f*ck&#039;s sake, Congress voted on this without having all the information. It makes me sick when i think about it. What&#039;s the point of electing people to represent our best interests if they don&#039;t have all the information, if the information they do have is cherry picked and sculpted? <br /><br />More to the point, what has to happen to make sure that this doesn&#039;t happen again? How do we demand accountability and transparence?

				If this could be proved, wouldnt impeachment be a Slam Dunk?<br /><br />Would it be necessary, advisable?<br /><br />I heard a conservative say with total sincerity that if you demand different policy elect a different administration. Would the next be more accountable? Depends. A diligent Senate would help.<br /><br />I would watch how <span class="bbc_u">&#039;transparent&#039; </span> the campaign would be.<br /><br />I appreciate when an administration consults the minority party and nominates members of the opposite party to their cabinet.

				I&#039;m totally ready for impeachment. <br /><br />Voting isnt&#039; enough. We have to demand candidates whose promises go a little deeper than new programs. We need candidates who are ethically capable of accountability and have demonstrated it in the past. I would love it if we could make an example of bush by impeaching him and keeping an eagle eye on the next pres.

				Nice numbers, but how many people were polled and what&#039;s the demographic breakdown of the polling sample? I have a hard time believing this represents Americans as a whole...&nbsp; it sounds like some kids were sitting in a bar (probably at a &quot;Drinking Liberally&quot; event) and did a show of hands. Nothing wrong with that, of course, but it&#039;s hard to interpret the numbers without knowing where they come from.

				I did check the website, it just said that they took a poll and didn&#039;t reference any other place on the site. So to be scrupulously accurate, they could have written &quot;84 percent of our readers are in favor of impeaching bush/cheney&quot;. <br /><br />It&#039;s not that I prefer milder news, it&#039;s that I am more interested in what americans think about impeaching the president than what dfnyc.org&#039;s readers think. Accuracy is the issue, not flavor. I think we could get more interesting results from a poll on Astorians.com

				<br /><br />Zogby Poll: 53% of Americans Support Impeachment; <br />ImpeachPAC Announced!<br /><br />November 4, 2005<br />New Zogby Poll Shows Majority of Americans Support Impeachment; <br />ImpeachPAC is Launched to Support Pro-Impeachment Candidates<br /><br /><br />By a margin of 53% to 42%, Americans want Congress to impeach President Bush if he lied about the war in Iraq, according to a new Zogby poll commissioned by AfterDowningStreet.org, a grassroots coalition that supports a Congressional investigation of President Bush&#039;s decision to invade Iraq in 2003.<br />The nationwide telephone poll was conducted by Zogby International, the highly-regarded non-partisan polling company. The poll interviewed 1,200 U.S. adults from October 29 through November 2.<br /><br />The poll found that 53% agreed with the statement:<br />&quot;If President Bush did not tell the truth about his reasons for going to war with Iraq, Congress should consider holding him accountable through impeachment.&quot;<br /><br />42% disagreed, and 5% said they didn&#039;t know or declined to answer. The poll has a +/- 2.9% margin of error.<br /><br /><br />http://www.zogby.com/Soundbites/ReadClips.dbm?ID=11562<br /><br /><br />(A small majority would not be enough to make the tribulation of an impeachment successful.)

				Paul Mooney - on the Dave Chappelle Show - as his character Negrodamus - the soothsayer - was asked if Bush knew whether there were WMDS<br /><br />&quot;Of course he knew - he has the reciept&quot; - food for thought.<br /><br />Although just as likely he knew they were transferred to Syria to be placed in hiding.&nbsp; Of course Bush should be impeached he&#039;s a total disgrace and never should have gotten away with stealing the Bush/Gore election.

				I disagree, Colin Powell knew he was selling us a bill of goods. I didn&#039;t believe there were WMD in Iraq, and I was dead set against going in, until I saw Powell in front of the UN insisting he had undeniable proof. I felt he was the one person in the Bush administration that had some integrity. Man was I wrong. He had his chance right there to tell us the truth, but he went along with the charade. Like alot of others, I was hoodwinked because I believed he wouldn&#039;t lie about something as vital as the catalyst for going into a war. They were all in on it, from Bush, to Cheney, to Rice, to Tenet, to Powell. If I were in his place, and I felt pressured to lie for the president (see General Petraeus), I would rather resign.<br /><br />Clinton gets impeached for trying to cover up an affair, then what does Bush &amp; Co get for lying about the reason to go into a war? Isn&#039;t that treason?

				I always had this fantasy of the two of them (Bush and Cheney) being led away from the White House in handcuffs.&nbsp; I felt that it would be the ultimate punishment for them, and hopefully, a lesson for future occupants of the WH.&nbsp; This is just a fantasy, and it does not make me happy by any means.&nbsp; It depresses me that our country has sunk so low.&nbsp; Are we, the people culprits and participants in this macabre charade?&nbsp; <br /><br />Some of us, who had read the Project for the New American Century knew from the start the the whole weapons issue was a lie.&nbsp; No one would listen.
