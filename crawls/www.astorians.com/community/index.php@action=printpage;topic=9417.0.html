				I know it&#039;s not what you are looking for, but I&#039;ve used Turbo Tax for years and I highly recommend it. It is essentially the same thing a tax preparer uses at a fraction of the cost.

				Depending on your tax situation, TurboTax might be free for federal (you&#039;ll still have to pay for state...like $20-30?). My situation is no longer free, but I filed both federal and state with 2 Schedule C&#039;s for around $70 last year. <br /><br />This will be my third year using TurboTax and I also highly recommend it.

				I have tried to set up TurboTax, TaxAct, as well as TaxSlayer.&nbsp; They all gave me the same amount for using the standard deduction.&nbsp; TaxAct did have the cheaper fee and was also pretty user friendly.

				I use www.taxengine.com (http://www.taxengine.com) and I&#039;m very satisfied with it.&nbsp; I chose it because two years ago, when I qualified for free preparation, this was the only online preparer that was free for both Federal and state taxes.&nbsp; <br /><br />One thing I like about TaxEngine is that they give you very quick e-mail help--just send them your question and you&#039;ll get an answer in a minute or two.

				I knew I would find information about Turbo Tax here on this forum. I was reluctant to use it at first, but it sounds like it got some good reviews. Does anyone know if it works on the Mac? Should I use Firefox? Anything is better than last year. I went to my mom&#039;s accountant in Suffolk County and he had never filed NYC taxes before. He totally screwed up and thankfully (and rightfully so) knocked off about $50 from my overall fees. That was the first time and last time I will use an accountant, at least until I own property and have dependents.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I don&#039;t know much about Turbo Tax, but I like I said earlier.&nbsp; I used TaxAct.&nbsp; Actually officially submitted the eFile on February 18th.&nbsp; I received my refund today, 8 DAYS!!!&nbsp; It only cost $13.95...&nbsp; It does both State and Federal, and this does the nitty gritty stuff for your local NYC taxes.
