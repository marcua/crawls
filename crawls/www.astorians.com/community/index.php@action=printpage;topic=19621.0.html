				Hello Astoria Mothers!<br /><br />Need a break?&nbsp; I&#039;m your woman.&nbsp; As a nanny, I have found that more often than not, it is the stay at home moms that truly need a little time to breathe.&nbsp; I&#039;m offering my services to stay at home moms (or anyone, really) in need of a break. Basically, I watch the kids while you take that nap or shower you have been dreaming of.&nbsp; Or, you watch the kids and I clean and run the errands you just can&#039;t find the time for. I am currently working for a few families, and&nbsp; I would like to expand my clientele.&nbsp; I love spending time with kids, and I equally love giving overworked moms a break. I am usually available on very short notice, and I don&#039;t want you to feel weird if you only need me once in a while or for short periods of time.&nbsp; It&#039;s all about helping you get some time to yourself (something so many mothers put on the back burner).&nbsp; I&#039;m here for you.&nbsp; Let me help.&nbsp; References available.&nbsp; Background check on sittercity.<br /><br />Hope to hear from you.

				I&#039;ve just moved to Astoria and wondering if you&#039;re still interested in adding any new clients?&nbsp; <br />I have a 5 year old and a 1.5 year old, and I work, and sometimes we just need a little help with light cleaning, laundry... or I need a few hours out in the evenings with my husband.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />We live near the 30th Ave subway stop.&nbsp; Would that work for you?
