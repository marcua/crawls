				Ok, back to square one... I know nothing of radishes or savory!<br />So in my search for something familiar i could use savory on i found this kick ass recipe, now to actually make it is another thing, looks like work!<br />Cherry Cola Glazed Ribs, yum! (there&#39;s savory in it!)<br />http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/recipes/recipe/0,,FOOD_9936_34049,00.html (http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/recipes/recipe/0,,FOOD_9936_34049,00.html)<br /><br />I would love to get some easy cheesy radish recipe&#39;s from you all, help?

				I think Jonathan needs to post as he seems to be our resident chef. :)<br /><br />I am assuming that the origination of people saying that they like &quot;savory&quot; things came from reference to this plant.

Fr. dial. sadriege, Sp. ajedrea, and perh. by metathesis the synon. sagerida):- L. satureiam. On the other hand, Heresbach (De Re Rustica, 1570) cites an It. savoreggia and F. savoreie, and the latter appears in Cotgr. 1611 as savorée. The existence of these forms suggests that the ME. saverey may be an adoption of an unrecorded OF. form which had the v either as a phonetic development in hiatus (cf. F. pouvoir for early OF. pooir) or through the influence of saveur SAVOUR.<br />&nbsp; Independent adoption of the Latin word appears in OE. satureye, ME.

				Well, as Meg said, I found the information and links about summer savory in this week&#39;s Weekly E-Share to be very helpful.&nbsp; From the Weekly E-share:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Summer savory (Satureja hortensis) is an annual that has a strong, peppery and slightly piney flavor reminiscent of thyme. Native to the Mediterranean, it was much in demand in early Rome as a medicinal treatment (a good treatment for bee stings); it was also considered to be a powerful aphrodisiac. The dried herb formerly came to this country from Austria. <br /><br />Use summer savory to flavor beans, peas, pork, game and sausages. It is also used to enhance poultry stuffing (see below), soups, stews ( near the end of their cooking time), fish (top chilled, poached fish with a blend of savory, chives, lemon juice, and mayonnaise) , and pizza. It makes a flavorful oil or vinegar. Medicinally, it is used as a tonic and digestive.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Flooz, dried and fresh herbs are always interchangeable.&nbsp; The only difference is that dried herbs are more potent, so you need more of the fresh to attain the same taste.&nbsp; (If you think your dried herbs are not as strong, then it&#39;s time to throw them out and get fresh dried herbs. ;) )

I used to think that some of her cooking rules were just like her— eccentric—but I *can* tell the difference when I make a sauce with fresh or dried oregano. So, I just keep faithful to the list. She once sat me down in her kitchen and made me taste a dozen different types of parsley. I had never realized that the type of parsley made such a difference. When a recipe called for parsley, I just bought the first bunch my hand reached. I learned so much from her. I miss her terribly. I hope she knows that I still follow many of her recipes, and have passed them down to my children.

				A few years ago I attended a very posh affair.

				Hey folks - I&#39;m very inexperienced with radishes, but tried them raw tonight as was suggested and found I wasn&#39;t really digging it.

I made it using the french breakfast ones.<br /><br />I realize most of you have probably already eaten (or started to) your radishes, but maybe you can try this out next time!<br /><br />Glazed Radishes<br /><br />1 lb. radishes, trimmed<br />1 tbsp. unsalted butter<br />1 tsp. sugar<br />1/2 tsp. salt<br />2 tbsp. minced fresh parsley leaves<br /><br />In a heavy saucepan wide enough to hold the radishes in one layer cook the radishes in the butter with the sugar and the salt over moderately low heat, stirring, for 1 minute. Add 1/2 cup water, simmer the radishes, covered, for 10 to 15 minutes, or until they are tender, and boil them, uncovered, shaking the pan occasionally, until the liquid has been reduced to a glaze.

I was just going to roast my asparagus again, but this would be different, and knock out the peas too...<br /><br />And Flooz, apparently you&#39;re just snipping them off the stem and cutting off the bit of root at the end. You don&#39;t have to peel them, although I&#39;ve heard doing so can help cut the sharpness of the flavor. In this recipe, keeping the skin on seemed to help them, as the smaller bits absorbed too much of the salt/butter (you&#39;d think that would be a good thing, but I liked the larger, whole pieces better)!
