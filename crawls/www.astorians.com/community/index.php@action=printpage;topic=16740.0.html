				For many years, this year included, there is Christmas music along Steinway. Does anyone know who is responsible for this? Is it a BID or other merchant association? A local politican? An issue voted on at a Community Board (or other body)?&nbsp;

				Why do you ask? Do you not like it? It has been around since the mid 90&#039;s or so. I remember the first time I heard it, I was walking on Steinway, thought where on Earth are these carols coming from?, Looked up and saw the speakers mounted on poles. People who passed me by might have asked themselves &quot;why is this guy smiling?&quot;&nbsp; -Needless to say I like it.&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				Steinway Street is full of second floor residential apartments and the noise from holiday music blasting over bullhorn speakers all day and into the night is a nuisance.&nbsp; When affected residents complain, Steinway Street BID ignores them because they are the same people who are members of Community Board 1.&nbsp; I believe individuals have rights and they should not be captive to noise in their own apartments so that others can derive a profit.&nbsp; Additionally, if I were a merchant, I would question whether the holiday music actually increases consumer spending.<br /><br />As a shopper walking on Steinway Street, I can only say there is nothing as merry than the gentle hymns of Silent Night amplified over rusty Army-style bullhorns and garbage blowing on the street because the merchants can&#039;t be bothered to properly tie-down their own garbage at night.

That&#039;s *my* personal annoyance with the music: it&#039;s the same stuff I heard over and over and over when I worked retail and on a crappy sound system to boot. If you have to listen to the same generic music for 8 hours a day for almost two months it gets really old, trust me.

				I&#039;m an atheist too, Christmas is mostly a pagan holiday in origin. Just imagine that the Christmas music is celebrating what it&#039;s actually celebrating, Winter Solstice and keep it moving. Letting yourself get upset about Christmas and Christmas music is futile, there will always be a Christmas. That said, have some pie and hot chocolate and enjoy the season in whatever way you choose.

				The music doesn&#039;t play 24 hours a day, usually only when the shops are open. If my windows are open, I can hear it and I am a block off of Steinway. It kind of echoes through the back alleys on non-windy days. The thing that bothers me is that you can&#039;t get away from the music. You hear it on the street, you hear it in the stores, you hear it in the supermarket. It&#039;s everywhere!

				I think this same argument happens every year on Astorians.com. &nbsp;I tend not to be around Steinway so I don&#039;t hear it so much. &nbsp;I think people play if for the commercialism aspect rather than any religious one. &nbsp;I mean, really, since when have the holidays been about religion for consumers, anyway? &nbsp;The whole holiday has been made into one big marketing opportunity, just like Valentine&#039;s Day, Halloween, and Easter. &nbsp;Go to any mall and the music is all over the place too. &nbsp;Steinway is just one long mall.<br /><br />I happen to like some Christmas songs. &nbsp;I happen to enjoy Christmas because of the family time I get. &nbsp;I usually like this time of year because of the parties, and spending happy times with friends and families. &nbsp;So music outside, as long as it&#039;s not all night long, tends not to bother me, but I certainly understand how it could get annoying. &nbsp;Hell, when the card shop on Ditmars and 33rd St put up their holiday decorations and that god awful horse in their store in August, I was disgusted. &nbsp;I still am, by the sheer tackiness of it. &nbsp;It&#039;s an eyesore.<br /><br />On the same topic, I was annoyed with holiday music playing in restaurants. &nbsp;Most of the restaurants around here have a bad taste in music as it is, but I actually had to ask them to put on some traditional Thai music this weekend. &nbsp; The holiday music there was a bit much.

				Wow, I just joined and posted a note about this same topic. Guess I should have looked to see if anyone else was asking about this issue first! <br /><br />Like some others of you, I also live on Steinway, and I also work from home. My complaint about the Christmas music has nothing whatsoever to do with political correctness; rather, I am being driven insane by trying work while being forced to listen to loud music all day. Since I&#039;ve never seen this in any other public space anywhere in the city, I&#039;m guessing whoever is responsible for the music has done this without seeking municipal approval. Steinway Street is not a shopping mall--it&#039;s a city street on which many taxpaying New Yorkers reside, and as such, I think it&#039;s inappropriate that the music is being played outdoors. I just called in a complaint to 311. If any of my fellow Steinway residents share this feeling, I&#039;d ask that you consider doing the same. Maybe if a few of us raise the issue at the same, we can draw some attention to it. <br />(I don&#039;t want to be grumpy about the holiday season; I just want to be able to work from home without being bombarded by this stuff all day.)<br />Thanks, and happy holidays everyone.

The streets should not be littered with the noise, and the flashing lights in ones eyes, and the naked greed that pervades this country three months out of every year. If people want to believe, that&#039;s fine, but the rest of us should not have to have this stuff forced down our throats every year. Especially from someone like you, who clearly thinks that only THEIR religion should be tolerated. It&#039;s people like you that make me wish that ALL religion was off the streets. And out of the decisions of congress in passing bigoted laws. It&#039;s disgusting.

				America was originally founded by Freemasons, not Christians.&nbsp; It was based on the idea that men are born free to choose how they live and worship.&nbsp; America is a secular country and has always been.&nbsp; A predominance of Christian Americans does not make a Christian country any more than a predominance of Caucasian people make a white country.&nbsp; America is a melting pot of people from all over the world, and Muslims are a part of it.<br /><br />If you need a primer, I recommend Schoolhouse Rock:<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWJ4udW41Ns<br /><br />The issue of Christmas music on Steinway is not a religious statement, it is designed to increase business for the stores during the holiday season.&nbsp; It is an evident public nuisance for nearby residents and the SSBID gets away with it because they are politically protected.<br /><br />I do not reward bad behavior so I choose not to shop on Steinway Street nor do I patronize the local street fairs.

				Honestly folks, religious differences aside, this seems to me to be an issue of noise in a public space. On no other street in new York City have I heard/seen loudspeakers blasting ANY kind of music. It&#039;s a nuisance and a distraction to people who actually live on Steinway. These BID people seem to think Steinway Street is a shopping mall that they own. It&#039;s the lack of consideration for residents here that I find irritating. Play whatever music you want, just do it inside your store please.<br />-Peace

The quote actually comes from a treaty with Tripoli (http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/treaty_tripoli.html) that was written by Joel Barlow, a friend of Thomas Paine. It was signed in November 1796, near the end of Washington&#039;s second term, and sent to the Senate for ratification by President John Adams in May 1797. It was ratified in a rare unanimous recorded vote, including &quot;Yea&quot; votes from both of the two Senators from the brand new State of Tennessee, William Blount and William Cocke. The treaty was signed by Adams on 10 June 1797 and proclaimed by him to the nation. It was reprinted in many of the newspapers of the day, one of which I&#039;ve actually held in my hands.

				When did school buses start to play loud Christmas music? I live near a grade school, and the bus was stopped for traffic, and lite-fm was blaring from it. It was never like that the 5 years that I rode a school bus, there was no music at all. Apparently every time it stops the music plays.

				The treaty of Tripoli is both interesting and very controversial when people try to use it to define the US as not a Christian Nation.&nbsp; I always understood that the argument about not being a Christian Nation in the treaty was for the statement that the US was not part of the religious Christian war against the Barbary Nation (a north African Muslim nation at the time).&nbsp; <br /><br />While I think it is an astute point that the founding fathers, through the implementation of a separation of church and state, truly meant for the US not to be a &quot;Christian&quot; nation, which could be and at the time would be controlled by a/the Church, to believe that the founding fathers as anyting but Christian is idealistic at best.<br /><br />Yes they were free masons, yes they were part of other groups, but look through the quotes of Washington, Jefferson, Adams, Henry, etc., and you will find plenty of statements that it is through God that a person is free, or that insures our liberties.&nbsp; So, yes the US is not a Christian Nation, but the US is founded on Christan beliefs and ideals.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />On the OP, I admit, I enjoy the music, and don&#039;t see it as a nusiance.&nbsp; I also find it hard to beleive that there is no other place in NYC that does this, but I admit I can&#039;t support that fact.&nbsp; I also hope people report back if/when they &quot;impose democracy&quot; and attempt to bend the BID/CB/City Council to their will.

				I recognize that one might enjoy this music if shopping or strolling down the street. But I&#039;m asking people to imagine hearing it 8 hours a day, inside their apartment, while trying to work. Under those conditions, would it still be enjoyable? And is it alright for an unelected group of people to impose this on Steinway residents? <br /><br />I&#039;m not trying to be a crank.

				<em>the reality is that this is just one more cruel lie that eventually causes children pain when they discover it.</em><br /><br />Never understood why some people say this.

				And what&#039;s wrong with &quot;Happy Holidays&quot;?! Not everybody celebrates Christmas. It&#039;s not even Jesus&#039; real birthday. <br /><br />I&#039;m all about the Winter Solstice myself: Before there was electricity etc., humans paid close attention to nature, and figured out that this is the shortest day of the year. <br /><br />As a way of celebrating longer days and more sunlight ahead, they celebrated by bringing evergreens indoors, lighting candles, and feasting on meat (cattle that couldn&#039;t be fed through the winter were slaughtered.)<br /><br />I find that THIS is something worth celebrating: It&#039;s a holiday that unites all humans regardless of religious beliefs, and doesn&#039;t involve strictly imposed traditions- in other words, there&#039;s a spiritual component to it. Despite the fact that it pre-dates holidays like Christmas and Chanukah (which all happen to be around the same time of year, gee whiz what a <em>coincidence</em> :rolleyes: )

That&#039;s what frustrates me because what I perceive as a problem with noise presents itself to others as an opportunity to condemn religion, in this case Christianity, and I think that&#039;s what some people find troublesome.<br /><br />It&#039;s all too much at times and I often find myself too busy or tired to take the time to separate the multitude of issues and comments in a single thread and present well thought out responses to all of them.<br /><br />I&#039;m not particularly religious and if Christmas is not your cup of tea then so be it. But count me in as Pro-Christmas. It&#039;s a time to be with my family, make food, and be happy.<br /><br />If the Christmas music on Steinway annoys you then consider yourself a true Astorian at heart because I think some aspect of it, namely the limited playlist and the crappy speakers, bothers just about anyone who walks down that street during the holiday.<br /><br />My Christmas wish: Lose the music on Steinway and spend the money on better decorations (or maybe earmuffs for all).<br /><br />Spread the cheer, it&#039;s Christmas. Happy Holidays to one and all.

				I live on 38 st and 30 ave. &nbsp;I work nights, so I &quot;sleep&quot; during the day. &nbsp;Actually I do not get any sleep from mid November till the beginning of January because of the volume of Christmas music playing all day long. &nbsp;It starts at 10:30 in the morning and goes till about 7:00. &nbsp;It is so loud that I can hear it even with the windows closed. &nbsp;I have complained for the past few years. This year the volume has actually been a little bit lower, but still annoying. &nbsp;<br /><br />In all, &nbsp;I find it a little sad to be on Steinway during the holidays. Years ago you could do most of your holiday shopping along Steinway. &nbsp;Now all I see are closed stores and not much of anything else I would want to buy.

				Who in their right mind thinks that this music imposed every day all day on everyone living on Steinway is a good idea ? What a way to ruin the holidays for everyone who doesn&#039;t feel like listening to this garbage all day every day. What about people who have to work at night and need to sleep during the day ? What about students you have to study? What about small children or babies to have to sleep? It is the most obnoxious imposition the most inconsiderate stupid idea I have ever seen a municipality implement . Imagine if somebody tried doing this anywhere in Manhattan . It would last 10 seconds . And no it has nothing to do with being positive or negative about the holidays. I love the holidays and the first guy that puts up the Christmas tree but this is different this is totally tacky and it&#039;s forced on everyone in the most unsophisticated way. I think it&#039;s taking business away from Steinway because people don&#039;t want to shop having to listen to this annoying music and so they stay away from Steinway . I think the only way to stop this is to get a court injunction to shut it down which I am considering at this moment .

				<br /><br /><br />I hate the music too, and that&#039;s just me passing through the area.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t even IMAGINE having to listen to that 24/7 for weeks on end.&nbsp; Who said waterboarding was the best form of torture??<br /><br /><br />As to the person who implied this is all about poliitical correctness, the problem is that people who live and work in the area are literally held captive with this music.&nbsp; They have no choice but to listen to it.&nbsp; Forced noise is in fact a form of torture employed with POWs, prisoners in solitary confinement or who are being purposefully tortured to get them to &#039;talk&#039; or snitch, etc.<br /><br /><br />Also irritating about this music is the sheer rationale behind it.&nbsp; It&#039;s all about trying to get people (christians) in &#039;the spirit&#039;....the spirit to spend spend spend and buy stuff stuff and more stuff.&nbsp; It&#039;s all quite repulsive...the gross consumption in society as a whole.&nbsp; Most people have WAY too much stuff already...in their homes, their garages, etc.&nbsp; Instead of christmas being about &#039;stuff&#039;, it should be about spending time with people you care about ...having a meal or drink together...fun times and experiences....not about this &#039;forced&#039; idea that you &#039;must&#039; buy &#039;something&#039; for &#039;every person you know&#039; and that they in turn are &#039;supposed to&#039; reciprocate, and that if folks don&#039;t reciprocate then they must be &#039;cheap&#039;.&nbsp; It&#039;s all so insidious.... all this pressure to BUY.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />There&#039;s a reason why so many people in Astoria say they don&#039;t have enough parking spaces for their MULTIPLE cars in their family, and it&#039;s because their garages are so full of stuff and CRAP, that they can&#039;t park any of their cars in there.&nbsp; (I see this ALL the time all over my part of Astoria....I often see garage doors open and residents going in to get something, and I can see the garage is full to the ceiling...used for STORAGE of their STUFF... and then the drive leading to the garage has one car, the street in front of their house has 1-2 cars, and THEN.... NOT uncommon for me to sometimes see cars parked across the SIDEWALK....yes, on the sidewalk, halfway in the street and halfway up on the sidewalk...so that&nbsp; any pedestrians have to walk between their driveway and the other car on the sidewalk.<br /><br /><br />When you take a step back and look at the gross consumption that is &#039;christmas&#039;, and the everyday gross consumption of so many Americans...with all their &#039;stuff&#039;...their multiple cars (god forbid anybody walks a few blocks, takes a bus or taxi, or gives another family member a ride!...no...it&#039;s MY right to have my OWN car!...[I guess just like it&#039;s gun nuts &#039;rights&#039; to own as many guns and ammo as they desire, right??].... not to mention the couch potato lifestyles of so many Americans...sitting in front of their 50&quot;....72&quot; etc. plasma TVs.... eating junk food...&nbsp; it&#039;s all quite revolting.

				The Steinway BID needs to fix Steinway in so many ways it&#039;s not funny.&nbsp; It could be a great shopping street, like Austin St in Forest Hills but what we have is one junk store after another, more and more stores closed because landlords are so greedy, and restaurants closed one after the other because who would choose to make that street a destination for dinner.&nbsp; I hope the new TEA place survives (near Broadway) - seems to have a lot of people in it.<br /><br /><br />If the stores were better people would come from other communities to shop there - Woodside, Jackson Heights, etc. but the BID needs to encourage more major business to set up shop on the street.
