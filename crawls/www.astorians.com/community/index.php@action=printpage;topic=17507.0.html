				Has anyone ever had to take a pre-employment drug test (urine or saliva)?&nbsp; Have you ever been worried that you wouldn&#039;t pass it but then did?&nbsp; Have you ever tried any &quot;detox products&quot; to beat the test?&nbsp; What kind of products or remedies did you try?&nbsp; <br /><br />By the way, these are research questions, I&#039;m doing a report....yeah, that&#039;s it, a report.<br /><br />&nbsp;:wink:

				I had to take one, but I wasn&#039;t the least bit concerned since I don&#039;t drink ro smoke or take any drugs, not even aspirin. <br /><br />However, there are several natural products that can help cleanse the chemicals and toxins from your body. Renew Life is a great product which I use to keep semi regularly. I suggest you try Sai Organics on 30th Avenue, they carry the products and can answer your question better than I can.<br /><br />http://www.renewlife.com/category/cleansing.aspx (http://www.renewlife.com/category/cleansing.aspx)

				I had to take one at my most recent job.&nbsp; It was humiliating as hell, urinating in a cup (which feels oddly hot in your hand -- not warm, hot, like a cup of coffee), with the attendant banging on the door after 20 seconds, I guess to make sure I wasn&#039;t smuggling in a bottle of baby&#039;s urine something, a la professional baseball players.&nbsp; Felt totally wrong and offensive to me, an ugly byproduct of the &quot;Just Say No&quot; Reagan administration, which, by the way, was the last time I got high on illegal substances.&nbsp; (While I don&#039;t miss pot, there&#039;ll always be a special place in my heart for magic mushrooms.)<br /><br />Had two friends do the same for their jobs over the past few years, too.&nbsp; One a heavy drinker, the other a pot smoker -- and they were sudden/random tests.&nbsp; The drinker didn&#039;t seem particularly worried -- do people ever get fired for over-imbibing a legal substance like this?&nbsp; But the pot smoker put himself into a world of self-imposed misery for the next few weeks, sure that his employers would find out his horrible secret and fire him.&nbsp; (The guy&#039;s not a rasta, but he smokes pot about as regularly as most people social drink.)&nbsp; Nothing ever happened, and his test had to come back positive as he&#039;d gotten high that weekend, two days earlier.&nbsp; I honestly think these things are given for a company to use as potential ammo with an employee should things get to the &quot;need extra excuse for firing&quot; stage.
