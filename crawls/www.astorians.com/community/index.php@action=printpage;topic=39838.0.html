				This thread has been read 145 times as of my writing this, not including the reading I&#039;m doing now. Are there NO good handymen in Astoria? Really?<br /><br />What do Astorians do when something needs repairs?

				Believe me, I wonder the same question about repairs.&nbsp; I have a shopping cart with a broken rear axle.&nbsp; I can find replacement wheels online, which I don&#039;t need, but nothing in regard to axles, and the one time I attempted to ask at Home Adviser I got an instant estimate of $150 minimum because nobody has heard of repairing shopping cart axles and the site thinks I&#039;m talking about car axles.&nbsp; The cart cost about $20 20 years ago.&nbsp; It&#039;s now 99% cart, 1% broken, and 100% useless and I finally gave in and mail ordered a new cart.&nbsp; You might have to use a site like Home Adviser, though.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				https://www.homeadvisor.com/<br /><br /><br />Home Advisor is for finding home repair/ home care people.&nbsp; They&#039;re not real estate agents, and home means &quot;home&quot;, not just &quot;house&quot;.&nbsp; It&#039;s like Angie&#039;s List.&nbsp; I&#039;m not recommending any services because I haven&#039;t actually used them, I&#039;m just saying if nobody on Astorians knows of anyone to recommend to you, you might try looking for someone on a professional listing site.&nbsp;

				I have two double-hung windows, right next to each other, in the room where I spend most of my time at home. The top parts of each window have slid down and there&#039;s no putting them up again. One window has slidden about 2&quot; or 3&quot; down; the other has slidden all the way down. I am defenseless against both insects and the elements.

				You need your springs repaired.&nbsp; Pretty simple job - you can youtube it and do it yourself or call someone like All About Glass.&nbsp; Or someone at your neighborhood old fashioned hardware store could give you a recommendation - there are still a couple of these around Astoria.

				Thanks, astoria101, but I&#039;ve looked at a few of those videos and I haven&#039;t seen a one that doesn&#039;t confuse me further. I&#039;m going to have to call a handyman (brrr).
