				Hello there fellow Astorians!<br /><br /><br />I am looking for a car to borrow for one night a week (Monday). I need it to travel to Queens college and back. Public transport is a nightmare getting there, and zipcar and uber get very expensive after a while...<br />So if someone has a car gathering dust Monday night and would not mind making some money letting a neighbor use it, let&#039;s talk!<br /><br /><br />I have a clean driving record , am mature and responsible. Obviously, I will pay for the gas I used as well.<br /><br /><br />You can contact me at my email address : karmashka@yahoo.com<br /><br /><br />Lena<br /><br />

				I simply want to &#039;applaud&#039; you for your efforts.&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp; I&#039;m sorry it seems you&#039;ve gotten no replies.&nbsp; I find it very sad and utterly wasteful how most Americans utilize their cars.&nbsp; It&#039;s a fact that most cars sit doing absolutely nothing 90% of each day.<br /><br />In many other countries, the idea of car-sharing has caught on.&nbsp; But like many things, it seems the US really has a ways to go.&nbsp; Most car-owners are extremely wasteful.&nbsp; Unless you live in an outer borough where you have no good access to a subway and/or you have young children or very elderly family, for the most part there is no good reason to own a vehicle in a place such as NYC, and with its great public transportation, taxis, Fresh Direct delivery, dry cleaning and laundry pickup/delivery, Amazon delivery, Chewy.com delivery, Zipcar rentals etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Many NYers manage just fine without a car.<br /><br />I have never owned a car in my life and have zero interest in ever owning one.&nbsp; The cost to buy a car, maintenance, repairs, insurance, registration, shoveling in the winter, dealing with parking, gas, traffic, etc.&nbsp; Who needs it?
