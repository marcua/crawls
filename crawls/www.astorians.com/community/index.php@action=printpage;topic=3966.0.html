				Cannot think of a single nation where one party rule is good. Can you?<br /><br />When you have the machine, you are given your orders with the knowledge that you have no effective means to protest except, of course, being apathetic and not voting (which they regard as good as a vote for them).<br /><br />If a politician thinks you are in his pocket, he has no incentive, repeat, no incentive to do anything for your interests. His focus is entirely on the fence sitters. Thats is why only a handful of states get all the attention. <br /><br />We are ignored.<br /><br />With every election, more and more candidates are running unopposed. Today, its a significant percentage. This is dangerous. Every major publication that reviews the political process claims a major overhaul is due and healthy competition is the key to a healthy democracy.<br /><br />The difference between the parties? For every Bush and Rumsfeld you have a Hevesi and MacLaughlin. <br />Our system is stuck in a rut: 300 million people and all we can come up with is Bush, Clinton, Bush, Clinton?<br /><br />The greatest crisis facing our nation today is the lack of competition in the political system and the hijacking of the political process by special interest campaign donors. The impact on the landscape? Just look at the strip mines out west (Republicans and minerals) and in strip mines in your back yards (Democrats and overdevelopment) <br /><br />

				I&#39;ve voted for third parties in the past and will continue to do so. I think they&#39;re much more effective at a local level than at the national level at this point. But I don&#39;t agree with the argument that a vote for a third party is a wasted vote. It&#39;s important to be strategic and change from within, but also important to build an alternative voice.

				Final point, nothing brings out great politicians like a crisis.<br /><br />In my opinion, the greatest presidents of the 20th century were real reformers facing critical challenges to the body politic: both Roosevelts and Kennedy. <br /><br />Some would regard Reagan as a reformer, but the current climate of smoke and mirrors (a la Hollywood flash as opposed to real substance) started with him, who was not much more than rather one-dimensional actor who lived in the past (and was given a free pass by the media)<br /><br />Third parties? The Green party is a joke, running on obscure issues tied more to their donors than the community&#39;s interests. They could get a lot of milage if they ran on environmental issues as in Europe.<br /><br />Better people would run for office it the time spent, and costs for, campaigning were shortened, as in Europe. They would not have to prostitute themselves (and their postitions) to their donars.<br /><br />And finally, the media. There must be a healthy arm&#39;s length relationship between them and the powers that be. Taking ads on the holidays from the politicians, and ads from the developers and cafes? <br /><br />Well, throughout most of their history, bias off the editorial pages was understood to be a part of the landscape by the general public. I wish something that can be done to make it clear to everyone that economic considerations both compromises and contributes to their failure at addressing the public good.<br /><br />Of course, eveyone knows all these points. They are not only mine, but commonly discussed by pundits. <br /><br />Want some fun? Send some of these ideas for reform to your favorite policitian and watch them dance!!<br /><br />

				First, I would like to thank anyone who is a registered voter and who is proud of their party.<br /><br />One question that I have for anyone is how do you think your political involvement has made a difference?<br /><br />To my opinion, voting is a very personal act that has somewhat some consequence.<br />On the personal level, you are giving your consent to the candidate of your choice to represent you.<br />Where we live, the vote totals hardly matter at all.<br /><br />(Maybe there was some exception for those who determined who would be the Dem candidate for Attorney General.)<br />I may soon be deciding whether to remain enrolled Libertarian (where I wont yet even have a chance of voting in a primary. But I find most primaries to be useless exercises determined by party machines).<br />How would my being enrolled in another party have a consequence?<br /><br />By voting for my ideals and hopes, I share my political solidarity with like-minded voters. Hopefully the whole of the issues will end up having some effect.<br /><br />:<br />Joining with other voters to support paper ballots for election<br /><br />Supporting civil liberties and the protections of the Bill of Rights<br /><br />Supporting homeowners from govt. taking of property (not effective so far in NYS, but have seen successes in other states)<br /><br />***<br />I hope all those with good faith in Mr. Spitzer find many of their hopes come true.<br />Amazed to read that Spitzer agrees it is a shame that private schools educate 15% of NY children but get only 1% of support from NYS.<br /><br />Will be paying close attention to the first 60 days of the next Governor&#39;s administration<br /><br />Thanks for any thoughtful replies.<br />Vote your hopes. Election Day Nov 7.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				When I first registered to vote, I registered as an independent, b/c I believed that would give me more choice. Then I realized that as an independent I couldn&#39;t vote in any party&#39;s primaries, so in fact I had even less of a voice. <br /><br />Being a registered Democrat, Republican, Independent or Libertarian doesn&#39;t mean you have to vote for that party on election day, but it does mean you have to vote within that party on primary day. <br />What I would really like to see are either open or non-partisan primaries, which might give voters the opportunity to put candidates that really represent their veiws on the November ballots. <br /><br />Another thought, in Italy, the media are not allowed to publish poll results AT ALL in the month before the elections. So when you get to election day, it is without that all too familiar feeling that the election in your district has already been decided... something I think would greatly affect voter turnout here as well<br /><br />

				Actually, we are not that young a country, or rather, our republic is not all that young. It has been around a lot longer that many other modern governments, like the Italians, or the Germans, or the Russians, or all the countries that didn&#39;t even exist before 1945. Maybe our problem is not one of youth, but one of decay?

				I have mixed feelings of non-partisan primaries.&nbsp; But the way I generally see it is that it&#39;s for a party to pick its candidate.&nbsp; Therefore, the registered members of the party should be the one to pick the candidate of their choosing.&nbsp; I don&#39;t feel right about having republicans voting in a democratic primary, and vice versa.&nbsp; I can just picture republicans flooding the democratic primary trying to pick the most unelectable person for the general election and same the other way.

				<br />&nbsp;:cry:<br />Dear Friends and Supporters,<br /><br />On Sunday, November 12th in Racine, I will hold my 1000th Listening Session with the people of Wisconsin. Before reaching that milestone, I want you to know that I&#39;ve decided to continue my role as Wisconsin&#39;s Junior Senator in the U.S. Senate and not to seek the Democratic nomination for President in 2008.<br /><br />Like many Americans, I am excited by the results of the November 7th election. My fourteen years in the Senate have been the greatest privilege of my life and I am extremely pleased with what we have accomplished. During so much of that time, however, we Democrats have not only been in the minority but have often been so deeply mired there that my role has often been to block bad ideas or to simply dissent. That is a very important role but I relish the thought that in this new Congress we can start, not only to undo much of the damage that one-party rule has done to America, we can actually advance progressive solutions to such major issues as guaranteed healthcare, dependence on oil, and our unbalanced trade policies. The Senate of the 110th Congress could also well be a place of greater bi-partisan opportunities for change; something I am very proud to have been effective at in both Republican and Democratic Senates.<br /><br />I hope all of you know how much I have appreciated the incredible response you have given me and the efforts of our Progressive Patriots Fund since January, 2005. In addition to all of our work in Wisconsin and D.C., I have traveled to seventeen states trying to promote the election of progressive Democrats in all states. At every stop from Birmingham, Alabama to Burlington, Vermont, to Ft. Dodge, Iowa, to Las Vegas, Nevada, people have agreed with my view that we need to stand up for a strong, principled Democratic party that is willing to replace timidity with taking the risks of promoting a platform of bold solutions to our nation&#39;s problems. Unfailingly, people responded well to my positions:&nbsp; opposition to the Iraq war; calling for a timeline to redeploy our troops from Iraq so we can focus on those who attacked us on September 11th, 2001; my opposition to the flawed provisions of the USA Patriot Act that threaten the freedoms of law-abiding Americans; my call for accountability for the Administration&#39;s arrogant disregard for the law especially with regard to illegal wiretapping; fighting for fiscal responsibility including tough common sense budget rules that will help end the reckless policies that have heaped a mountain of debt on our children and grandchildren; as well as my strong belief in guaranteed healthcare for all Americans and substantial investment in alternative energy sources and technologies.<br /><br />Yet, while I&#39;ve certainly enjoyed the repeated comments or buttons saying, &quot;Run Russ Run&quot;, or &quot;Russ in &#39;08&quot;, I often felt that if a piece of Wisconsin swiss cheese had taken the same positions I&#39;ve taken, it would have elicited the same standing ovations. This is because the hunger for progressive change we feel is obviously not about me but about the desire for a genuinely different Democratic Party that is ready to begin to reverse the 25 years of growing extremism we have endured.<br /><br />I&#39;m sure a campaign for President would have been a great adventure and helpful in advancing a progressive agenda. At this time, however, I believe I can best advance that progressive agenda as a Senator with significant seniority in the new Senate serving on the Foreign Relations, Intelligence, Judiciary and Budget Committees. Although I have given it a lot of thought, I cannot muster the same enthusiasm for a race for President while I am trying simultaneously to advance our agenda in the Senate. In other words, if I really wanted to run for President, regardless of the odds or other possible candidates, I would do so. However, to put my family and all of my friends and supporters through such a process without having a very strong desire to run, seems inappropriate to me. And, yes, while I would strongly prefer that our nominee in 2008 be someone who had the judgment to oppose the Iraq war from the beginning, I am prepared to work as hard as I can through the Progressive Patriots Fund, and consistent with my duties in the Senate, to maintain or increase our gains from November 7 in the Congress and, of course, to elect a Democrat as President in 2008.<br /><br />Most important, I want to continue my work as a Senator from this wonderful State of Wisconsin. Our fourteen year ongoing conversation that has taken place in hundreds of communities in Wisconsin in the form of open Listening Sessions is the principal reason I have been perceived as &quot;ahead of the curve&quot; on many key issues. Simply listening to the reasoning and passions of Wisconsinites remains the best source of good ideas and common sense I&#39;ve ever encountered.<br /><br />I love this country very much and am so lucky to be able to serve it in the United States Senate. My heartfelt thanks to all of you for your support and encouragement. <br />&nbsp;:-)<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br /><br />Russ Feingold<br />Middleton, Wisconsin<br /><br />http://www.progressivepatriotsfund.com/

				Yeah. I had the privilege of voting for Russ in &#39;92, when he first ran for Senate. He&#39;s a great asset to the country, and will remain so in the Senate for many years, I&#39;m sure.&nbsp;
