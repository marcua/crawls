				According to their website (http://bohemianhall.com/home.htm):<br /><br />&quot;The Outdoor Garden will be closed over the winter during major renovations. In the interim, continue to enjoy our indoor bar and restaurant facilities.&quot;<br /><br />Kind of vague, I know.&nbsp; I&#039;m looking forward to seeing the end product of the renovations, though!

				i know the beer garden opened a branch in Williamsburg with a retractable roof.&nbsp; i wonder if they will do it here?&nbsp; I am not sure if it is possible as the one in Williamsburg looks much smaller.<br /><br />I think we should start a rumour that the beer garden shut down.&nbsp; That way we will keep the Manhattanites and Brooklynites out of the neighborhood and we can have our precious beer garden to ourselves.&nbsp; Who&#039;s with me!

				I was there on a Sunday afternoon in the end of October, and one of the giant light poles fell over.&nbsp; No one was hurt, but I imagine fixing it would be a big rewiring job...I&#039;m hoping they run underground conduits, so there aren&#039;t live wires overhead waiting to fall in my beer!

				It would be really sad if they changed the character of the place with the renovations. The place hasn&#039;t changed in forever! When I was a kid, our church picnics were held at the Beer Garden -- some of my fondest childhood memories are of that place, it was really the one time of year our entire extended family got together in one place.

If the summer scene is too crowded for your tastes, there&#039;s always alternative times to enjoy it. Even early on Sundays in the summer isn&#039;t too crowded. The Sunday movies this summer were never too packed.

				The food is good, just don&#039;t try and get served by one their waitresses inside during the summer. We did that once, waited about 45 minutes, yes forty five minutes, to even get a freaking menu, then got fed up with it all and left without eating or even drinking.

				HA!&nbsp; That&#039;s normal there during summer.&nbsp; One waitress for the whole area, and yes, a long wait for menus, a long wait for your order, a long wait for your food, then a long wait for your check, then another to pay.&nbsp; No wonder the lines are so long, it takes forever to leave there!!&nbsp; If they would just hire some more waiters and expand the kitchen, maybe just maybe the aggravation of ordering there would be avoided.&nbsp; And the lines for kielbasa can be just as bad.<br /><br />Go during the week or winter and save yourself the hassle.&nbsp; I love the place, but the service leaves a lot to be desired.

				Yeah, if you go when it&#039;s not too crowded, you can sometimes order food and get it before you&#039;re too drunk to enjoy it... I recommend the vepřo-knedlo-zelo (http://www.bohemianhall.com/restaurant.htm), which is very good about half the time...<br /><br />And if you like the food at the beer garden, I highly recommend the Czech restaurant Koliba (http://www.kolibarestaurant.com/Home.htm) on 23rd ave at 32nd St.&nbsp; I think the last time we were there we got the pickled herring (very tasty in small quantities), the roasted pork loin (great), the spaetzle with sauerkraut and bacon (super great), and beer (what can you say).
