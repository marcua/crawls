				No cigar, I&#39;m afraid.&nbsp; But thank you for the info!&nbsp; <br /><br />I saw an Akido demonstration once and it is dramatically different from Kung Fu.&nbsp; Akido is more practical and grapply while my beloved northern style Kung Fu is all about jumps and other pretty gymnastic movements that I&#39;d never try in self-defense in a million years.&nbsp; Upon further reflection, maybe I would, but merely as a distraction to foil my enemies as I assemble a make-shift stun gun behind my back with my cell phone and housekeys.&nbsp; <br /><br />Nerdy DIY: One reason that northern Kung Fu has so many jumps is because the ground is less damp and spongey in the cold climate and better for jumping.&nbsp; In contrast, the soft squishy soil of the southern regions make it harder to jump about quickly.<br /><br />Well, if there&#39;s no Kung Fu then I guess I&#39;m gonna have to stick to my Carmen Electra&#39;s cardio striptease dvds for a little longer.&nbsp; Or, horror of horrors, join the gym.&nbsp;

				^^Ah ha!&nbsp; Another topic I love to gush about long-windedly!&nbsp; <br /><br />You can get Carmen Electra&#39;s cardio striptease online at Amazon or at Barnes and Noble in Union Square, which is where I got mine.&nbsp; She has a whole series:<br /><br />Disc 1: Aerobic striptease<br />Disc 2:&nbsp; Fit to Strip (tough workout of major muscles so that you are [insert dvd title]!)<br />Disc 3: Aerobic striptease with costumes<br />Disc 4: Lap dance<br />Disc 5: Hip Hop (of the genre: non-sequitorous dvdious)<br /><br />Discs 4 and 5 are usually sold as a package, and you can get the whole series as a collection and save a bit more.&nbsp; <br /><br />I fastidiously tracked forum discussions (on another, girlier, board) before deciding to buy this dvd due to all the glowing reviews.&nbsp; If you are just starting out and aren&#39;t sure if you want dvd-Carmen as your rather intimate workout buddy, then just get the first two discs for a good introduction.&nbsp; Personally, I thought dvd-Carmen was downright sweet and encouraging.
