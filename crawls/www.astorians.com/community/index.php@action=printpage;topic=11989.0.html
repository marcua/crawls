				My bf and I are <em>desperate</em> for a cheesesteak as close to being Philly-good as possible. We don&#039;t want to leave Astoria to find this. We want it now! Like I said, we&#039;re desperate. Any suggestions?

				Dillinger&#039;s has a good Steak and Cheese sandwich. It&#039;s steak tips with cheese, onions and peppers. It&#039;s not a Philly Cheeseteak, but it&#039;s darn good. McCaan&#039;s has something similar too that&#039;s pretty good.

				Forget it.&nbsp; Not going to happen.<br /><br />The closest steak that&#039;s even in the remote corners of the (Phillies) ballpark is Carl&#039;s at 33rd and 3rd in Manhattan.&nbsp; It&#039;s not too bad.<br /><br />There are only two places to get a real cheesesteak: Philly and the south Jersey (AC-area) shore.&nbsp; The rolls they use in Jersey are amazing.

				I was pleasantly surprised with the philly cheese steak I had at the TACO truck on 30th avenue and 32nd street.<br />He&#039;s there evenings from 7 on.<br /><br />The difference for me was that they used real juicy steak strips, :mrgreen:, not authentic like in philly I suppose but definitely<br />not the thinly sliced dry roast beef/steakums that I&#039;ve always encountered around here. <br />It was pretty damned good, who would of thunk?<br /><br />and if you are downtown there is a place I had an awesome one once on I think Murray St. a block or two north of WTC ground zero. niiiice.<br />

				99 miles to philly in manhattan on second ave and 10th ish is pretty solid.&nbsp; I also like the place on houston right by ludlow, south side of the street a bit west of ludlow intersection.&nbsp; As to astoria, I eat&nbsp; the steak sandwich at sunswick... its decent.&nbsp; I have also had the taco truck steak... and its pretty authentic.&nbsp; good luck.<br />

				Para, I appreciate your input.<br />In my opinion its never a waste of quality meat when I&#039;m eating it.&nbsp; I never understood the whole perspective of &quot;wasting&quot; quality ingredients on yourself.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard that same argument about liquor.&nbsp; &quot;you can&#039;t make a scotch and soda with 200 dollar-a-bottle scotch!&quot;&nbsp; Watch me.&nbsp; haha.&nbsp; All it results in is a more expensive, marginally better cocktail that leaves you with less of a hangover.&nbsp; Same goes for the cheesesteak.&nbsp; Perhaps I&#039;m not appreciating the quality of the beef to the fullest, but then again... my cheesesteak is just a little bit better.&nbsp; And if I can afford it... who&#039;s to complain?&nbsp; Anyway... I disagree that philly steaks are all about crappy meat.&nbsp; Thats why I won&#039;t eat at Ginos or Pats.&nbsp; Sick!&nbsp; Gristle and chewy fat.&nbsp; I stick to the spots that serve atleast a baseline quality of cow cuttings.&nbsp; I think I mentioned before but Ishkabibbles and jims get my vote in Philly.&nbsp; Some of the south philly italian spots are renouned for good steaks too... but I haven&#039;t investigated yet.&nbsp; <br />I haven&#039;t had one of those home depot steaks, but my buddy who used to be a vegetarian broke his diet and ate one at home depot.&nbsp; pretty funny way to go out.&nbsp; Maybe nyknifeandfork.com will do a review of the home depot cheesesteak spot.

There&#039;s small, medium and large - I got the medium (which is about the size a normal cheesesteak) and it cost me...$9.00! No wonder they don&#039;t put prices on their wall. Can&#039;t imagine how much a large is...For a friggen cheesesteak! And guess what, the &quot;steak&quot; was EXACTLY like grocery store bought Steak Ums...tasteless and extremely greasy (in a bad way)...they do pile on the meat though.<br /><br />Here are my ratings for the fake Cheesesteak sandwiches around this area: (with their approx prices)<br /><br />Home Depot: F<br /><br />Ani&#039;s Deli (28th street) - $7 - average size, average meat - too chewy, mediocre cheese, they burn their sandwich buns all the time: C+<br /><br />King&#039;s Deli (24 hour place on Steinway) - $8.50 - above average size, decent meat but very greasy, too expensive for the price: B-&nbsp; <br /><br />Othello Deli - $5.50 - best value by far in the area, average size, tasty meat only nothing like real cheesesteak mind you, they don&#039;t use rib eye - thick slices...Othello offers like 6 or 7 variations like Pizza cheesesteak or with mushrooms, etc.: B+<br /><br />Corner Deli (30th ave and 44th) - $6 - average everything: B-<br /><br />Subway - $9.25 for a footlong &quot;Philly Cheeseteak&quot; - ahem. D-<br /><br />I probably forgot a couple others, I&#039;ll post them if I remember!<br /><br />---<br /><br />I really like Carl&#039;s Steak in Murray Hill in the City. Best approximation of a cheesesteak I&#039;ve had in NYC. They raised their prices to $7.50 now for the regular cheesesteak sandwich. Have to try 99 Miles to Philly and Phily Slims.

				I just went back to my spot on houston and ludlow the other day.&nbsp; Its damn good.&nbsp; The rolls are really good.&nbsp; Soft, like genuine hoagie rolls.&nbsp; The place is actually called Philly&#039;s Cheese steaks.&nbsp; check it out.&nbsp; I recommend it.&nbsp; They offer wiz if your into that, but also have a selection of other cheeses like provolone and white american.

				Being from NYC I cannot claim to know the first thing about quality cheese steaks but there are some comments to be made.&nbsp; I&#039;ve bee to Gino&#039;s and Pat&#039;s. Loved the whole experience. In NYC the 99 miles place seem like mini cheese steaks and not so great or worth the price. Buns way too soft.&nbsp; <br /><br />There is one place that seems worth the experience but as Para said, it&#039;s a NY thing to go quality.&nbsp; BB&nbsp; Sandwich bar on west 3rd just East of 6th ave.&nbsp; A restaurant chef left the biz and opened up this little hole in the wall shop just above street level.&nbsp; Good meat, hand made onion toppings and decent rolls, round rolls so don&#039;t be upset.&nbsp; Good texture, squish and heft for the size and price.&nbsp; Haven&#039;t quite found a better one in NYC.&nbsp; Found a review here: http://www.bestcheesesteaks.com/cheesesteaks/ny.htm (http://www.bestcheesesteaks.com/cheesesteaks/ny.htm)<br /><br />And just to say it, the Home depot version ain&#039;t so bad. Not cheap but enjoyed it.&nbsp; Half the deal with cheese steaks seems to be about the experience after all.<br /><br />Now, will a Philli please tell me what sort of meat they actually use down there?

				GB,<br /><br />How important is the roll in a cheesesteak?&nbsp; My friend from Philly told me that the restaurant &quot;99 Miles to Philly&quot; used the same bread as the cheesesteaks he grew up with.&nbsp; He told me that a lot of places outside of the Philly area get &quot;most of it right, except for the bread.&nbsp; Before I could ask him what kind of bread he was talking about, he started complaining, again, about the size of the cheesesteak and the price.

				I was at <span class="bbc_u">Steve&#039;s Prince of Steaks</span> (http://www.stevesprinceofsteaks.com/) in Philly and my friend and I were talking about the thinness of the meat, and the guy behind the counter explained how they do it. They freeze the ribeye and slice it paper thin on a slicing machine and put papers between each stack so that all they have to do is pull out the next paper and there is all the meat they need for each sandwich.
