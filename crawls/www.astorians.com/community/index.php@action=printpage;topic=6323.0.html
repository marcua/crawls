				After trying to resist the puritannical busy bodies, I have decided that I have been beaten.&nbsp; I have decided to join them.<br /><br />So, smoking in any movie makes it R rated, because smoking is bad for your health and we do not want to encourage folks to start.&nbsp; I support this measure.<br /><br />I would also be in favor of any movie that depicts the following unhealthy acitivity as R rated:<br />Watching televsion,<br />Sedmentary lifestyles,<br />Automobile driving,<br />Eating fried foods, transfats or drinking soda or too much coffee,<br />Riding a motorcycle in urban settings,<br />Depicting morbidly overweight people.<br />Depicting anyone drunk.<br /><br />Let&#039;s make our society as clean and sterile as possible, so we can smoothly coast along from cradle to grave, interpersed with trips to Ikea.

				Now, Frappe, you know that I agree with you and I understand the pain you feel as a smoker whose rights are slowly revoked in all communities and venues, but do ANY of the activities you listed have the same statistical correlation with death that smoking has? <br /><br />With sedentary lifestyles, eating, and heart disease, that ofcourse will be difficult to support with data, as there are so many contributing factors...but be fair. <br /><br />Granted, I don&#039;t think smoking pot should have an R rating...that would be criminal, and can pot be related to like what...one death? Maybe?

				You don&#039;t have to worry about the depiction of &quot;morbidly obese&quot; people in Hollywood!<br /><br />But, that said, I completely agree with you. I think it&#039;s a pretty good example of governmental nanny-ism.

				I&#039;m surprised no one has mentioned artistic license.&nbsp; And what about films like Grease?&nbsp; Does that glamorize smoking?&nbsp; Or is it considered a period piece?&nbsp; Will filmmakers be afraid to make period pieces for fear of an R rating?&nbsp; Will they delete all smoking from period pieces on tv?&nbsp; Or do they already?&nbsp; &nbsp;I see both sides of this issue, but I can&#039;t help thinking too much regulation is bad for art - that includes art, music, film, and radio.&nbsp; I mean, when do we stop?&nbsp; And it all seems very subjective.

				Pretty amazing.<br /><br />One can, on film, depict violence, brutal violence--mass murder, torture, beatings--and still walk away with a PG 13 rating.&nbsp; Isn&#039;t murder and this glorification of violence a little more offensive then some guy lighting up a smoke?<br /><br />And on the same note, isn&#039;t a glimpse of a breast slightly more pleasant to behold then a bloody fist to the mouth?&nbsp; One&#039;s allowed, one&#039;s not.&nbsp; You guess which is which.<br /><br />I think the stewards of our society have got their priorities backwards.

I mean geez, why don&#039;t they just start having commercials showing the hearts of people who ate too much fast food, people who got shot in the face due to lack of gun safety, people ravaged by skin cancer due to too much tanning, genitals covered with warts due to unprotected sex. :roll:

				I&#039;m not a smoker and have never been one in my life--the only time I ever smoked tobacco was as a rite of passage, and once I experienced tobacco rejection I was completely satisfied.&nbsp; I have enough unhealthy, expensive vices without smoking.<br /><br />BUT THAT BEING SAID:<br /><br />I&#039;m with you, Frappe; I&#039;m aghast at this new rating standard.&nbsp; What will young people watch--legitimately, that is?&nbsp; How are they going to learn what a good movie is?&nbsp; I&#039;m no fan of the tobacco habit or the tobacco industry, but the era when people smoked routinely just happened to be the era when moviemaking was at its best.&nbsp; I&#039;m not saying that one caused the other, but that&#039;s just the way it was.<br /><br />Furthermore, young people should have the opportunity to see the excellent and important movie <em>Good Night and Good Luck.</em>&nbsp; One of the things I liked about that film, aside from its political content, was George Clooney&#039;s sheer refusal to turn a 50&#039;s story into a pseudo-2000&#039;s story.&nbsp; For one thing, people smoked in the workplace--that&#039;s what most public places were like during the 50&#039;s.&nbsp; It was well known that Edward R. Murrow smoked like a furnace.<br /><br />Not to mention the sheer ridiculousness of such priorities:<br /><br />&quot;One can, on film, depict violence, brutal violence--mass murder, torture, beatings--and still walk away with a PG 13 rating.&nbsp; Isn&#039;t murder and this glorification of violence a little more offensive then some guy lighting up a smoke?&quot;<br /><br />Amen.<br /><br /><br />What really gets a &quot;yuck&quot; from me, tho, is the scene in <em>It Happened One Night</em> where Clark Gable smoked IN BED!&nbsp; That can kill you more quickly than a lifetime of mere smoking.
