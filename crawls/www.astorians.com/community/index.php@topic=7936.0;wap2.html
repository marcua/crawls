			My nanny (and extended family member), Jaso, is looking to move into<br />housecleaning now that our youngest child is in nursery school. I<br />highly recommend her: she is hardworking, very thorough and, most<br />importantly, completely trustworthy. She has references not just from<br />me but others she has cleaned for.<br /><br />Currently she has two houses in Manhattan that she cleans every two<br />weeks for $100+tip each time. She would like to have a house to clean<br />every weekday, and she knows the Astoria rate would be cheaper, but<br />then she would not have to commute.<br /><br />If you are interested, please respond to me by email and I will forward<br />her contact information.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Sylvia<br /><br />

			She does an incredibly thorough job--cleaning refrigerators, ovens, laundry, etc, so she has a 4 hour minimum and she commits to one house per day.&nbsp; She also does post constuction and apartment turnover cleaning.<br /><br />For the Astoria neighborhood, she is willing to clean once a week for $75 vs once every two weeks for $100, no tip expected. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

			I had the pleasure of having Jaso clean my apt for the first time today. She truly is wonderful and did an excellent job cleaning up my 3 br, which was in bad shape. I don&#039;t think $75 for a 3 br is a lot of money for this area at all. Prior to using Jaso, I used several other Polish cleaners, who got the same amt of $, and were not nearly as thorough or pleasant as Jaso.

			I think $75 per week is very high - but for a 3br that was in bad shape, that&#039;s pretty reasonable.&nbsp; I have a small 1br that is tidy, so I&#039;d hate to have to pay the same rate.
