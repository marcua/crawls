				I&#39;m bumping this because I need a job too. My company just laid off 300 people in our location and (I heard) 1800 people over all. So I find myself without employment in the new year.<br /><br />I&#39;m making a career change into casting, but I&#39;m not kidding when I say that it pays almost nothing at entry level.<br /><br />So I&#39;m going to do some freelance copy editing and proofreading work, if anyone knows of anything. I have 6 years of editing experience and have worked on everything from speeches by Japanese government officials to elementary school textbooks. <br /><br />I&#39;ve also met a few actors who work as 2nd shift proofreaders and word processors in law firms. So that would be good too.<br /><br />Anyone? I&#39;ll beg. I&#39;m not proud.

				If anyone is interested in working in a hotel, let me know.&nbsp; I can&#39;t guarantee anything as I don&#39;t do the hiring, but the hotel I work in is always looking for people.&nbsp; You would have to be VERY professional as it is a very upscale hotel.&nbsp; If anyone is interested, PM me or email me at JavaJay73@Gmail.com.&nbsp;

				Good luck Yellow Mittens with the job search. Have you tried talking to your Advisor at Purchase? If I remember correctly they have a job center that helps graduates find jobs and internships. They might be able to help you out.<br /><br />On a separate note- I went to Purchase too! Awesome school! I wonder how many other Purchase Alumni are on this board??

				If you&#39;re into non-profit, look into the position openings at the Foundation Center, at Union Square! Their offices are nice, centrally located, and it seems like they&#39;re always looking for prospect researchers/development people. Can&#39;t beat the location!

				My non-profit is also hiring in the business development area. There are two positions available (http://www.lungusa.org/site/pp.asp?c=dvLUK9O0E&amp;b=2284841) for this. Seems like it would be interesting...<br /><br />We&#39;re also looking for a new CEO but that&#39;s a whole different ball o&#39; wax.
