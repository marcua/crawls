				I&#039;m doing my first Thanksgiving and I think baking a pecan pie would be a little over my head. I&#039;m between Martha&#039;s Country Bakery and Whole Foods and I can&#039;t decide. Anyone had the pecan pie at either or both and have any reviews to share?

				I&#039;ve never had a full-on pecan pie from Martha&#039;s, but I regularly get their pecan torts (which are basically little pecan pies), and I think they&#039;re spectacular.

				I don&#039;t know if they make all the pie crusts the same, but I have had two different fruit pies from Martha&#039;s and I just do not like their crust. You should try a slice sometime and see what you think.

				What about St. Honore? Across the street (nearby) Martha&#039;s. Not even sure if they make them but they&#039;re pretty&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				I love pecan pie, but I&#039;ve had Martha&#039;s version and it wasn&#039;t right. It&#039;s actually pretty hard to find a real traditional southern style pecan pie around here. Most bakeries I&#039;ve tried offer something closer to a tort than a pie. Good luck on your search!<br /><br />As much as I like to bake...this Thanksgiving I&#039;ll be pigging out on Sara Lee double crust apple pie (the frozen kind you pop in the oven)-so filled with apples and delicious warm with a scoop of vanilla icream on the side!

				Marie Callender&#039;s has a great pecan pie, but alas there are none here! That&#039;s what Ditmars needs! But that&#039;s for a different thread.<br /><br /><br />http://www.mcpies.com/famous_pies/pie_menu.php<br />

				I actually have a really simple recipe - it&#039;s not difficult at all.&nbsp; I made my first one last week and it came out great.&nbsp; If you want the recipe let me know.

				I wouldn&#039;t go for a Martha&#039;s pie... their crust is not right. It&#039;s way too sweet and not flaky. It reminds me of a shortbread crust and not in a good way.

				I third St. Honore, and not just for pecan pie but for everything. The other week we bought their coconut custard pie. Man oh man was it good!! And as usual it was fresh, probably the best coconut custard pie I have ever had. Light and creamy, not too sweet, it actually looked more dense than it actually was. And at $8 a virtual bargain compared to <em>the other place</em> a couple of blocks east.
