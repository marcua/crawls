				I just came back from there and the doors are down and no signs are up about it.&nbsp; The awnings are torn.&nbsp; Some little old ladies asked a waiter at Kyclades and he said their lease was up and they let it go.&nbsp; Not sure why, but he mentioned Bloomberg and higher taxes.&nbsp; The lease probably went up too high and they couldn&#039;t afford it.&nbsp; Typical story.&nbsp; Only the wealthy survive.&nbsp; Really sucks.

				This is horrible! I loved, loved loved Top Tomato, and they always had the freshest Astoria Pita bread (my fav brand :) I didn&#039;t even mind that they were cash only (I&#039;m usually a debit girl), since I&#039;d have to try really really hard to spend more than $10 there, their prices were so great.<br /><br />Also, this was a bonus feature of Top Tomato, but I liked that it was 24 hours when I was walking home late at night. Ditmars is gonna seem a LOT more desolate now in the middle of the night.

				The lease wasn&#039;t up they just couldn&#039;t pay the rent any more. They were paying over 15K per month for that place and the reason I happen to know it is because the owner of top tomato was trying to sell the lease and he offered it to my friend who was seriously considering taking it over and turning it into a deli but i talked him out of it. As for kyclades he turned it down he didn&#039;t want to pay the key money for the lease and he said the rent is too high.<br />I am sure the owner of kyclades will try to negotiate directly with the land lord since its the same guy that owns his store and maybe just maybe in a few months the place will get bigger and we will only have to wait an hour for a table.

				the rent was being raised from 10,000 to 19,000. TT said no and moved out.<br />it was there about 20 years.&nbsp; it came when Treasure Cove moved to a smaller store across the street.<br />it is a widely well-known fact that all the TT&#039;s are owned by a big time mafioso.<br />if you were around when TT opened, you will also remember that all the smaller fruit and veg. stores burned down all within a period of a month or so (36/dit, dit between 35/36, 31/dit, 31 between dit/23).<br />i wonder now that TT is out the business if small stores will populate again, if they find a storefront..<br /><br />i like seeing the huge MI outline buffed on the old rolled down gate in that pic.&nbsp; when 24 hour stores finally close and roll down that gate, you always find some OLD OLD OLD graffitti...

				In regards to the best/cheapest produce in the neighborhood, I found Trade Fair to be a close second to Top Tomato when I lived there. So if anyone hasn&#039;t ventured over there or has avoided it because the store is aesthetically not pleasing and is kind of dirty and smelly, give it another shot. The produce is generally pretty good (except for the artichokes, but TT rarely had good ones either) and fresh, and is definitely cheap.

				I can&#039;t bring myself to buy produce at Trade Fair, my personal policy is that if it&#039;s not factory sealed, I don&#039;t buy it there. Even a couple weeks ago, I went in looking for lemons (I thought, &quot;how bad could the lemons be?&quot;) and they were all dry and shriveled up, so I ended up going to Top Tomato. If I had known it would be my last trip there, I would have bought more than just 2 lemons!!<br /><br />Another option for those of us who live above Ditmars is Best Yet on 37th St. between 20th &amp; 19th Av. It can be a bit of a trek, but for those of us with cars, they have a huge lot, and they really do have a nice, big, inexpensive (for the most part) produce department. I&#039;m a big-time price shopper, and I always felt like their prices were right in line or just a tiny bit more expensive than Top Tomato. (I swear, I feel like a Best Yet pimp, I feel like I mention them all the time. I promise they&#039;re not paying me! :) Their ad is on their website if you want to peek at it.)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=15864.msg179434#msg179434">Quote from: ManicMaurice on August 16, 2009, 01:35:52 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I hate to ask this because it seems like suck obvious flame bate but ...<br /><br />Who&#039;s Steve?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I assumed it was the landlord that raised the rent, but maybe I&#039;m wrong.

I also like their containers of Mr. Mushroom or whatever brand those mushrooms are, and the little seedless cucumbers. Often times too I would find at Top Tomato not everything was in the greatest condition, usually something like green peppers, garlic, and even sometimes the tomatoes. To be fair, though, usually the things that looked bad at Top Tomato would simultaneously look bad at Trade Fair. Then there&#039;s Berry Fresh Farms, which has an enormous produce department but a lot of it is surprisingly sketchy looking and sometimes even moldy.

				I get lemons at the Korean grocer under the Ditmars station.&nbsp; Usually a good deal and the lemons are always fine.&nbsp; <br /><br />I hate the way produce can be packaged here on the east coast - stuff in styrofoam and plastic wrap.&nbsp; Yuck.&nbsp; I had never encountered that until I moved out here.

				i was very upset to find out that Top Tomato was shut down when i was looking for coconuts. argh.<br /><br />this was the only place i would go to for produce. i agree that berry fresh&#039;s produce can be sketchy at times. a lot of their stuff is bruised, or too ripe and you have to eat it right away. plus the rest of the items in that store are more expensive than the trade fair. <br /><br />i guess trade fair it is. <br /><br />ugh.

				I am floored that the place was closed.&nbsp; It was always pretty crowded.&nbsp; I&#039;m going to miss it, of course due to the prices of produce, but also because visually, I&#039;ve always thought that it was very distinctive and made the block very attractive with it&#039;s large banner and all of the colorful produce outside.&nbsp; It seemed to mesh well with neon lights of the barber shop, the blue awnings and wood of Taverna Kyclades, the (formerly) yellow awning of Ditmars Gyro Place, and the white Acropolis looming behind.&nbsp; It always just was a very attractive block to me.&nbsp; Now, to see such a large half-block essentially shuttered, is just depressing.&nbsp; I hope something moves in there ASAP.

				Isn&#039;t that what happened to the Sunshine Place (the Veggie place where the Dunkin went in)? the landlord asked for an astronomical rent hike at the worst time in the economy and it sat empty for almost 2 years.<br /><br />If the owners of the space are looking at that kind of increase, it may be awhile before something goes in there. The space isn&#039;t that big, unless a Duane Reade Xpress or something goes in there.<br /><br />Also what happened to Pamela&#039;s Pizza on Steinway. it&#039;s STILL empty.
