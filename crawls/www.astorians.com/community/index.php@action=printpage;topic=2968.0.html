				Daisy, I&#39;m so sorry to hear of your myspace woes.&nbsp; I personally don&#39;t understand the strong draw to myspace, but I&#39;m awed by how popular a site it is with the users.&nbsp; Too bad they have such crappy customer service.&nbsp; Hope things improve and that you get control over your information that you are hoping for.

				I prefer Friendster as well - though it seems that it&#39;s less popular than myspace.&nbsp; I love the music on myspace, but you get so many weird random friend requests, a lot more spam emails than on friendster as well, at least in my experience.

				I&#39;ve noticed they&#39;ve added some features, but I haven&#39;t really been all that interested in checking them out.&nbsp; What I&#39;ve always liked about Friendster is seeing the interconnections between friends, sometimes surprising ones.&nbsp; It feels a little more private and &quot;under control,&quot; if that makes any sense.

				Myspace doesn&#39;t show the linkages between folks, at least not that I&#39;ve seen.&nbsp; You have to look through people&#39;s friend&#39;s lists.&nbsp; Joining and managing groups on myspace seems more complicated as well.

				I know you can set the MySpace music app to not start playing automatically when you load a page.&nbsp; Just go to Account Settings &gt; Music Settings.&nbsp; Embedded content like quicktime or flash stuff will play regardless.<br /><br />As far as slow pages go, I think it&#39;s a couple of things that really make them awful.&nbsp; A lot of people use layout editors and want to throw the kitchen sink into the mix in addition to a bunch of songs (sometimes quicktime AND windows media AT THE SAME TIME) and huge, ugly-ass graphics.&nbsp; I think it&#39;s mostly all the embedded stuff that makes myspace suck sometimes.<br /><br />I see a lot of really ridiculous stuff on there but it&#39;s possible to do something clean that doesn&#39;t kill your friends&#39; computers when they look at it.&nbsp; Alison&#39;s page posted earlier was clean-looking and didn&#39;t slow things to a crawl, for example.&nbsp; And of course, there&#39;s always the boring default which loads up quick.

				rdc, thanks for the info that you can set the music to not start playing automatically.&nbsp; I had no idea!&nbsp; I thought there were no options and to me, that would suck.&nbsp; And you&#39;re right about some users wanting to put a lot on their page.&nbsp; Many a time I&#39;ve just given up on looking at a page because it&#39;s loaded so slowly.&nbsp; Sometimes I find the page hard to read with the kind of background a user might use, too.&nbsp; I&#39;ll take a look at Alison&#39;s page.&nbsp; I&#39;m guessing finding some clean pages will help alter my overall view of myspace.&nbsp; Some time ago I actually registered a page there, but got frustrated by bad myspace experiences.&nbsp; I can&#39;t remember what the page is called, but that is ok.&nbsp; Perhaps after a while (and viewing some well-loading myspace pages) I&#39;ll look for it.&nbsp; Thanks again!

				thanks for that music tip. no matter how low my volume music just blasts off other people&#39;s pages! <br />some people&#39;s pages hurt my eyes...they are usually 15 y/o though.<br />now only to figure out how to mute the sound on the video comment someone left me.<br />nothing like hearing yakko warner sing the nations of the world while at work...at home it puts a smile on my face...at work, a blush and a big &quot;oops! sorry!&quot; to the sales force.

				Glad I could help yall out :)<br /><br />Nobody should be skurred of myspace.&nbsp; It&#39;s really useful for staying in touch with people.&nbsp; I usually mute my sound when I&#39;m browsing just in case something wants to start up automatically on me.&nbsp; Being jolted with some random Britney Spears track or whatever in a quiet bedroom/office sucks.

You&#39;d be surprised. Thing is, the 30-somethings aren&#39;t taking little hoochie shots for their default pics and making pages so poorly designed they&#39;re unreadable, and the whole &quot;young kids on Myspace giving out too much info&quot; thing is such a scandal anyway that no one really pays attention to the other people.<br /><br />I like it because a lot of my friends from high school, old jobs, etc are on there.
