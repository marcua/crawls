				To keep everyone in the news, Hellgate, Astoria and the new Sunnyside CSA all got some press. The Queens Chronicle did a great little piece on CSAs. Pick one up on your neighborhood corner (they&#039;ll be available until Thursday) or follow the link below. Read up and enjoy!<br /><br />http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=18085149&amp;BRD=2731&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=574903&amp;rfi=6

				just a suggestion... It would probably be good to give at least a few days notice on these type meetings.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure there are quite a few of us that don&#039;t check the message boards on a daily basis and would have liked a heads up.&nbsp;

				I could not attend, but my bf`s mom was there last nigh and she said there was a huge crowd there - in a good sense, which is great - a lot of people are interested. She also said that a girl who organised all this ( I assume its you Belle&nbsp; :wink: ) was very happy and pleasantly surprised to see so many people came.<br />Anyone was there? How many members so far we have?

				If you want information on Astoria CSA on a more timely basis, please head over to www.astoriacsa.com and on the main page sign up for our news mailing list at the bottom of the page. It&#039;s the best way to keep informed about upcoming events.<br /><br />If you register you will automatically be added to this list.<br /><br />An update regarding the Membership Drive the other night: our meeting with the farmers went very well. We surpassed our expected numbers (of attendance and registration) and have hit our membership goals! Thank you to all who attended it was an amazingly successful night. It&#039;s so exciting to hear everyone elses&#039; excitment about this CSA that some of us have been working on since November!<br /><br />For the time, registration is still open, we can handle about 50 more shares.<br /><br />If you have specific questions, please send emails to: info@astoriacsa.com <br />We won&#039;t be checking this message board as frequently...<br /><br />Thanks!
