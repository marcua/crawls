				Hi Mer<br /><br />Congratulations on your upcoming nuptials! All of our invitations are custom designed, hence a variety of prices.&nbsp; If you are working within a budget I would be more than happy to show you what we can offer in your budget range.<br /><br />Perhaps you have colors, shape and design in mind - well ... we can incorporate all of your desires into your reality (at least we&#039;ll try our best or die trying).&nbsp; We can meet at your local Starbucks, visit my studio in Astoria (and be overly stimulated) or at your home.&nbsp; &nbsp;God knows, you&#039;ve got plenty on your plate planning a wedding.&nbsp; Any location easiest for you is where we&#039;ll meet!&nbsp; Just make sure you bring your ideas with you.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you rather stick to the web - tell me a little about the event and what you are looking for.&nbsp; I have quite a large spectrum of possibilities.<br /><br />I look forward to hearing from you and hopefully working with you.&nbsp; Once again CONGRATULATIONS!!!<br /><br />Besides my website you can access more pictures on Going Postal Designs Facebook page!<br /><br />
