				Considering that my bedroom is a &quot;cozy&quot; 8x10 room, I&#039;m in the market for a futon. Anyone know a good place to get one? I always feel that salesmen are out to get me when it comes to pricy items. I&#039;ve never owned one so I don&#039;t know what to look for.

				This place was wonderful to deal with.&nbsp; Check out their website and the actual store is walking distance from the N/W http://www.bigapplefuton.com/cgi-bin/frames.cfm?CategoryID=7&amp;SubCategoryID=14 (http://www.bigapplefuton.com/cgi-bin/frames.cfm?CategoryID=7&amp;SubCategoryID=14)<br /><br />Their selection is varied, although leans towards modern.&nbsp; Delivery is free to Astoria and ships immediately if they have the item in stock.&nbsp; Can&#039;t remember if the set-up was free too or if there was a small fee.&nbsp; I did tip the guys nicely - $20 I think.&nbsp; <br /><br />Good luck!&nbsp;

				I got a couch from Big Apple Futon and had no problems with them.&nbsp; I did my shopping online, and then went to the physical store to make sure I liked the couch as much in person, and to buy it.&nbsp; It&#039;s on 23rd between 2nd and 3rd, I think.&nbsp; They do offer free delivery within the five boroughs, but be aware that that is curbside delivery, no setup, no taking away anything you had before.&nbsp; That said, once they got it off the truck they looked at me and looked at the stairs and said, you want us to bring it up?&nbsp; They did without an additional charge, so I gave them a nice tip.&nbsp; IIRC, full service delivery is around $50.

				I have one that I&#039;m looking to sell, it&#039;s a nice style (looks like a couch).&nbsp; It&#039;s used but in good condition and has a nice cover too.&nbsp; PM me to let me know if you are interested and I will take a picture and email it to you tonight.

				Ikea is your best bet.&nbsp; The one in Hicksville LI has a nice selection.&nbsp; Or you can try the Ikea in NJ.&nbsp; They always have good deals in the &quot;As Is&quot; section.

				There are also a bunch of furniture stores on Steinway street that probably sell cheap futons. We bought our futons (no longer have them) from J&amp;A Furniture on Ditmars, which I think is no more, and I don&#039;t think that they were really that expensive at all. I think it gets more expensive if you get nicer ones (i.e. wood futons, etc.). <br /><br />IKEA might be a good idea, but I imagine the shipping (if you do shipping) is astronomical, and more than a hassle if you have to schlep it yourself unless you have a handy dandy car or truck.<br /><br />There&#039;s always craigslist, too. There are people looking to upgrade or get rid of their furniture all the time, so I am sure you could find quite a few futons listed on there.

				Thanks, all. I ended up finding what I wanted at a place on Steinway that sells futons. For some reason, they&#039;re called &quot;Steinway Futons&quot;. Never would have guessed. Beware of Best C&amp;N Furniture down the street though, they gave me a completely different price each of the three times I went there. Big Apple Futons has some nice stuff too, but the salesmen are a bit pushy.
