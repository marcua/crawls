				I&#039;m not single, but I&#039;m always thinking of good date ideas that aren&#039;t the standard dinner-and-a-movie date.&nbsp; (The bf and I still have date night.)&nbsp; I like to keep a list of creative things that are fun and make conversation easy.&nbsp; And lately, I&#039;ve been trying to come up with non-food based dates.&nbsp; <br /><br />I moonlight for a company that I think is a really good first or second date idea.&nbsp; It&#039;s a company called Watson Adventures and they do scavenger hunts around the city.&nbsp; You don&#039;t collect items, you answer questions and try to win against other teams.&nbsp; I&#039;ve worked for this company for a few months and I&#039;ve seen a lot of couples on the public hunts.&nbsp; It got me thinking that it would be a good first date because:<br /><br />1) It&#039;s finite.&nbsp; The hunts are either 1.5 or 2 hours so if the date sucks, there&#039;s a definite ending in sight.<br />2) You have to use teamwork so it puts the couple in a place where they are working together so you can see if you&#039;re compatible.&nbsp; Also, you can see if your date is WAY too competitive against the other teams. <br />3) You can see if your date is a moron almost immediately.<br />4) The conversation flows because there is an activity that requires focus so you&#039;re never strapped for something to talk about.&nbsp; You also learn fun and interesting things about the city, which leads to more conversation.&nbsp; <br />5) It&#039;s fun and active but not strenuous.&nbsp; No athletics required, which can be iffy on a first date.&nbsp; You walk.&nbsp; <br /><br />http://www.watsonadventures.com/<br /><br />(Since I know it&#039;s coming: Yes, I freelance for the company but my pay isn&#039;t affected by attendance so I&#039;m not just advertising -- trust me, they don&#039;t need my advertising.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s a fun/different date idea since I&#039;ve seen couples on the hunts who look like they&#039;re having a really good time.)<br /><br />Anyone have other interesting non-food based date night ideas?&nbsp; I like dates that have a focus.&nbsp; &quot;Walk around Central Park&quot; is a nice date idea but I&#039;d rather something with a little more of a specific objective, you know?&nbsp; <br />

				When I was living on Long Island, I went a few mini-golf/batting cage dates. It was especially fun if you both sucked and you could laugh throughout the date. Guys were always impressed if I could actually hit the ball. (Slow-pitch softball) <br /><br />Here is some local batting cage info:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Astoria Sports Complex, 34-37 37th St (between 34th and 35th Aves), Astoria, NY, 718-729-7163<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Batting cage hours: Mon–Fri 1–10 p.m.; Sat, Sun 11 a.m.–10 p.m.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Batting cage rental: $12/15min, $18/30min, $30/60min<br />

				this is not a first date idea, you have to know a person&#039;s religious tolerances and how well they can bullshit - but I used to like to go&nbsp; cult-infiltrating with dates. Yes I&#039;m super geeky. I would just find an interesting looking religion/cult and attend a meeting. i&#039;d ask questions about their beliefs and act like I was considering joining. Besides the obvious dogmatic intrigue, there&#039;s always great people-watching. Then there&#039;s great conversational fodder afterwards! <br /><br />if possible on a first date, I like to ask my date if we can duck into a bookstore -&nbsp; you get instant info about a person by the kind of books they gravitate towards...gives us something to talk about! &quot;Oh! you like graphic novels! me too! oohh!&quot;<br />or the reverse, if they say, &quot;oh i don&#039;t read much,&quot; i know to wrap the date up early. :)

				i guess &quot;infiltration&quot; is the wrong word. I would just go to a cult meeting and get more information. Then again, i hadn&#039;t found a cult that so intrigued me that I&#039;d wanted to &quot;get under the covers&quot; of it more.

				No.&nbsp; Be yourself on dates, especially when it comes to intelligence.&nbsp; If your date doesn&#039;t like smart people, you&#039;re dating the wrong person.&nbsp; <br /><br />Jennifer, we&#039;re not compatible -- I only do NY Mag crosswords nowadays. <br /><br />Bookstore and crosswords, very good date ideas to get to know a person.&nbsp; But those are more secondary dating ideas, not the main focus of a date.&nbsp; &nbsp;I like the mini-golf idea but Randalls is hard to get to if you don&#039;t have a car.&nbsp; <br /><br />Keep &#039;em coming!

				Mini-golf...I&#039;ve been on a LOT of mini-golf dates. Although, it&#039;s very good for sussing out whether your date has a temper (one date ended shortly after my companion throwing a tantrum on the 10th hole). <br /><br />When I&#039;ve done online dating, I&#039;ve had messages from potential suitors saying things like, &quot;What the $*(# does ________ mean?&quot;, referring to some (usually not too unusual) word in my profile. That&#039;s a great way to get the girl. Show your low level of intelligence and then curse at her for it. Real panty-dropper there. I like the idea of the crossword puzzle for that reason. There should be a special &quot;singles crossword&quot; expressly for the purpose of figuring out your date&#039;s vocabulary.

				I like museum dates (and museums generally).&nbsp; You stroll, you look, lots of things to talk about.&nbsp; I&#039;m a big fan of MOMA and PS 1 (in LIC).&nbsp; The Museum of the City of New York is also an excellent choice.&nbsp; And for the 3rd date, there&#039;s always the Museum of Sex!

				I&#039;ve never been very good at crosswords or trivia, especially in publications like NYTimes and NYMag.&nbsp; Most seem to assume you know a lot of Broadway shows and actresses, and retain TRIVIAL information about a lot of things that my brain doesn&#039;t see the need to retain.&nbsp; Does this mean I&#039;m dumb?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; It means my brain sorts through what is important - read NOT TRIVIAL - for my brain to retain and what is not and throws all the trivial stuff to the side.&nbsp; So a date focused on trivia would really suck for me, especially if the other player was extremely competitive.&nbsp; It&#039;s just not that much fun when you&#039;re made to feel stupid because can&#039;t answer any of the questions.&nbsp; My brain is more suited to scrabble than crosswords or trivia.&nbsp; I also went on a Watson&#039;s adventure during the holidays in Midtown - do not do this!!&nbsp; Do it somewhere not overrun with masses of tourists and tinsel and where you can take your time.&nbsp; I spent most of the time running after two competitive leaders of the team determined to win.&nbsp; It was crowded and I could barely keep up.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t learn a thing because I couldn&#039;t spend any time enjoying finding out the answers and thinking about it.&nbsp; I got a free Tshirt out of it though.<br /><br />A good date for me - an outdoor salsa concert.&nbsp; Now that would be fun!&nbsp; I&#039;ve always loved a good dancer :)

				I thoroughly second museums. Absolutely love going to museums with friends or on dates. Have noone to go to museums with now though since my museum buddy moved to Massachusetts.<br /><br />About 8 months ago I went to the museum of sex with a girl on a 4th date or so and that was a pretty good date. I &quot;jokingly&quot; suggested it and she was enthusiastic about it so we went. Great and interesting topics were discussed and it showed she had a fun/wild side that she was willing to go.<br /><br />Stay away from the medical fetish section though if you&#039;re a guy. <br /><br />I think for a first date or even second date a museum may be a bit intimidating and seem like a big commitment to women (or men) in general, just an FYI.

				One of the best first dates I had was taking a salsa class with a girl. I looked like a total ass, because my salsa skills were, to put it nicely, a little weak. <br />It&#039;s always a good ice-breaker, though, and gives us something to laugh/talk about afterwards. It&#039;s also not a very big time commitment, so if either party is having a bad time, there is an opportune escape window. <br /><br />+1 on the Museum thing. I always think of that as a 3rd or 4th date thing at the earliest. That&#039;s committing a whole afternoon, especially if it&#039;s the Met or Natural history. The Sex Museum could be done in an hour or two though, so that&#039;s not too bad (But the flip-side is that it&#039;s not always cool with both sides; personally, I don&#039;t think I could date a girl who would be offended by the sex museum)

				Totally true that a museum can be overwhelming, but I never, whether on a date or not, try to do a whole museum.&nbsp; I go to an exhibit or maybe two.&nbsp; But for a whole museum, P.S. 1 is great for a &quot;quicky&quot; as is the Noguchi (sp?) and both in LIC.

				it seems we all have the consensus that for a first date we do something simple (lest the date go awry), and save the creative stuff for later.<br />If I do go to dinner, on a date, I like to try to go somewhere that neither of us has been, that way it&#039;s an adventure for both of us. If it&#039;s good we rave, if it&#039;s bad, we have bad reviews to write when we get home on our blogs!<br /><br />I know this sounds weird but sometimes when I&#039;m getting to know a person sometimes I just ask them to &quot;hang out&quot; with me while I run some errands. If we can have fun while just doing mundane things then that&#039;s a good sign.<br />

				Maybe it&#039;s because I am excited about going to bet on ponies this weekend, but I think an afternoon at the horse track would be a great first date, especially if you know how to read the race cards (plus it will make you seem mature and smart).&nbsp; Belmont is relatively close by, is actually very pretty, drinks are readily available, you can bring a picinic, and is a relatively low cost adventure.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know about the Aqueduct Recetrack, but if worse comes to worst, they have the flea market.

				I think it sounds like a great date idea.&nbsp; But I think it would be a better second date than first.&nbsp; If the person is a complete dud, there&#039;s no easy escape.&nbsp; You&#039;d have to <em>know</em> that you can spend at least a few hours with someone first. <br /><br />

				Street Festival time is coming up...so there is always that...<br /><br />It wasnt a date but a nice day, none the less...<br />Years ago, I rented a tandem bike with a friend and rode around the city for a couple of hours, stopping on occasion for Belgian beer. We just happened upon the Swedish American Summer festival and jumped off to listen to music and make flower head rings from flowers everyone was handing us. It was a really laid back day but memorable.

				Avoid the American Museum of Natural History at all costs. They nickel and dime you and charge you for certain exhibitions. The rest of the museum was underwhelming and much like going to the Bronx Zoo if all the animals were dead and stuffed in a believable pose. Also the Dinosaurs exhibit was very small. There is also the Rose Center for all you astronomy buffs. But I find most Museum experiences to be boring, and at the end of x hours I am really tired and very thirsty. <br /><br />Live Music would be a better idea. (PS 1 however would be the exception for me, esp. in the summer).
