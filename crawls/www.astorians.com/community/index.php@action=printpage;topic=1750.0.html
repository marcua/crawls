				Funny essay (http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/12/opinion/nyregionopinions/12CIcosentino.html) on the Metro Opinion page of the Times today, by a woman named Barbra Williams Consentino. In shocking violation of Fair Use, here&#39;s the text. If you disapprove, please buy a copy of the Times (and read the fascinating essay in the Magazine about the ethical and legal issue of &quot;wrongful birth&quot;...).<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">WHENEVER our friends the Mosses say, &quot;Let&#39;s get together soon,&quot; my husband and I agree, mentally mapping out the best way to get to their apartment on the Upper West Side. Do we take the car and spend $30 for parking? There&#39;s also the F train to the D to the No. 1 uptown. Or, of course, we can always take the R train to 57th Street and walk from there.<br /><br />Why do we do this? Because after 25 years of living in Queens as geographic undesirables, we know that &quot;let&#39;s get together soon&quot; really means &quot;let&#39;s get together soon — in Manhattan.&quot; Every time the idea of seeing another couple comes up, we can&#39;t help but sigh, knowing that we will be the ones trekking into the city to visit our friends.<br /><br />It&#39;s not that we&#39;re bad hosts. On those few occasions when intrepid adventurers have actually crossed the East River, we&#39;ve served them excellent wine and good food. We&#39;ve entertained them with challenging games of Trivial Pursuit or penny-ante poker. In fact, those brave enough to visit have claimed to have had a good time. So why then are we so often the visitors instead of the ones being visited?<br /><br />When asked, our city pals offer these explanations:<br /><br />• &quot;Our trip to Queens is longer than your trip to Manhattan.&quot; Is that in miles or kilometers?<br /><br />• &quot;The street numbers don&#39;t make any sense. We&#39;re afraid we&#39;ll get lost.&quot; You have a degree in mathematics from M.I.T., and you can&#39;t figure out that 64th Road is in Rego Park and 64th Street is in Woodside?<br /><br />• &quot;Between Shea Stadium and the tennis center, there&#39;s too much traffic.&quot; But the theaters, museums and tons of restaurants in Manhattan attract lots of people, most of whom take taxis even though it can take 15 minutes to drive a city block in rush-hour traffic.<br /><br />• &quot;There&#39;s nothing to do in Queens.&quot; Then why is there so much traffic? Queens has some of the best ethnic restaurants in the city, historic sites like the Louis Armstrong House and the Queens County Farm Museum, bucolic parks and enough shoe stores and clothing boutiques to keep a shopaholic content for weeks.<br /><br />• &quot;We came to Queens already.&quot; Oh, yeah? Well, we paid taxes last year, and I suspect we will again this year.<br /><br />• &quot;I grew up in Queens and going back there reminds me of my tortured adolescence.&quot; So, you&#39;d rather be reminded of your approaching senescence, sagging derrière and imminent addiction to prune juice?<br /><br />• &quot;I&#39;m allergic to trees.&quot; And the trees in Central Park are hypoallergenic?<br /><br />As tiresome as the trip into Manhattan gets, there are, however, some good things about leaving our neck of the woods to come into the big city. We have the opportunity to feast our Forest Hills eyes on some urban wonders — grimy skyscrapers, scurrying rats the size of Chihuahuas — and enjoy the cacophony of city sounds: screeching sirens, clanking garbage trucks, pounding jack hammers. We get to eat city food, prepared in restaurants or take-out joints since few Manhattan apartments have kitchens that are large enough to prepare a meal in.<br /><br />And I guess there&#39;s some good things about the fact that people seldom visit us. It lets us keep the great things about Queens a secret. Why let others know that our public schools are stellar and that Queens has the best moussaka in the city?<br /><br />On that note, I&#39;ve got a great idea: Let&#39;s meet for brunch in Brooklyn.<br /><br />Barbra Williams Cosentino, a clinical social worker, nurse and psychotherapist, is working on a memoir.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Heehee. :) (Of course, my Brooklyn friends declined to come up for dinner last night...)<br />

				I say let&#39;s keep letting people think Queens sucks, that way it stays great for those of us who live here.&nbsp; I can&#39;t tell you how many times I hear how better it is living in Manhattan or more specifically, Brooklyn, than to that forgotten borough of Queens.&nbsp; But hey, let them keep saying it.&nbsp; If there&#39;s any way to keep the rents down and any more Blockbusters and Starbucks and other corporate bohemeths from moving in, I&#39;m going to try.&nbsp; I miss the days when I could &quot;up and decide&quot; to go to the Beer Garden on a friday night at 11pm.&nbsp; Now, it&#39;s like an event, I have to plan it, and tell everyone to get there by 8, because if you&#39;re late - you get that awful line that never moves....<br /><br />So really, I guess folks are already discovering how great it is here.&nbsp; But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going the way of Williamsburg too much, Astoria has a way of resisting that whole thing...<br /><br />Anyway, just wanted to say hi.&nbsp; Just discovered this site a couple of months ago, but love reading all the raves, rants, helpful hints, etc. etc.&nbsp; My only previous post had to do with bed bugs - the survival from which is like a badge of honor these days.&nbsp; Originally from upstate, I&#39;ve made my home in Astoria for the past 8 years, and love it.&nbsp; Can&#39;t contemplate moving yet.&nbsp; It&#39;s sort of a like a little suburbia (is that bad to call it that?), birds, trees, even fireflys, yet I&#39;m still only 15 mins from Manhattan.&nbsp; I&#39;m 29, an animator, and live around Ditmars currently but more towards the power plant.

				Oh... come on...<br /><br />I love Astoria... but... darn it there are some things that I&#39;d like to change<br /><br />first of all - the prices aren&#39;t cheap here - to rent, to buy or to shop<br />and we DO have Blockbuster and Starbucks - <br />We don&#39;t have any decent bookstores (I HAVE been to Seaburn multiple times... and it&#39;s a different topic but the store sucks on many different levels)<br />we have no cafes (in my neck of Astoria) - and I don&#39;t mean the smokey Euro Frappe Disco Music 24/7 sort of cafe... I mean the laid back... east village... seattle... crunchy... sort of cafe. <br />We have the most hideous architecture in all 5 boroughs and every new building seems to not just continue the trend - but to actually push the envelope on UGLY. <br />We are incredibly short on interesting events, shows, live music, readings, dance, theater, the arts....... (um... culture I guess in general). <br />Yes - I know we have the Noguchi and the MoMI and there&#39;s the graffiti place in LIC and some galleries there to boot...&nbsp; <br /><br />We have food.&nbsp; Lot&#39;s of good to very good food.&nbsp; Restaurants and markets... <br /><br />But queens - at least our neck of queens and I&#39;m guessing the rest...&nbsp; definitely has earned it&#39;s position as the punchline of so many jokes about bad taste.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#39;ll be honest - I wish the neighborhood WAS a little more Williamsburgish - or even Greenpointish at this point.&nbsp; <br /><br />It would be great to see some thriving art, music, literature, creative sort of folk and the evidence that they are alive and living in the area.&nbsp; We don&#39;t see that... I see a lot of low end consumerism 99cent stores and nail/hair salons.&nbsp; <br /><br />Don&#39;t tell me to leave.... I do love my neighborhood - I&#39;m just down on it today (and maybe tomorrow).&nbsp; <br /><br />I would like others to come clean and admit that Astoria just ISN&quot;T all that.&nbsp; <br /><br />Jennifer<br /><br />

				Astoria is exactly what is was planned to be.<br /><br />Many, many years ago, when Astoria started to decline, the Steinway Street BID, the Broadway BID, the 30th Avenue BID and the Ditmars BID worked together in an effort to help control the area to retain the flavor that was originally intended.<br /><br />Although gentrification had already begun—and YUPPIEs were moving in—had no-one stopped to understand what this community was becomming it would have ended up *just* a cultural stopover for the *better-off* young population. Astoria was a community of families. Not singles. Not even couples. Families. Schools, transportation, decent, affordable rentals, affordable shopping areas were the requisites. <br /><br />Around 15-20 years ago, when Manhattan rents went sky high, people were relieved to find a small apartment in Astoria for half of what they would be paying in Manhattan. They had other options at that time. Greenpoint. Park Slope. Williamsburgh. They were ripping down some of those garish 6-story walkups, and all those beautiful brownstones were being gutted to accommodate 6-8 units instead of the old way which was a unit per floor.<br /><br />Astoria used to be called the parking lot of Long Island. We used to be able to park our cars *without* driving around for hours or paying a month&#39;s rent for a garage! When the influx of the YUPPIE population showed their willingness to pay more for everything, the neighborhood started it&#39;s downfall.<br /><br />What happened to the times when we knew we had to schlepp to Manhattan to buy books, or go to museums, or to a zoo, or buy ethinic foods? Why does *every* neighborhood.community have to accommodate all the needs of everyone? I really loved that Astoria was a bedroom community. That we had some fairly decent grocery stores; some that even delivered. That there was always somewhere to buy a birthday card, discounted, disposable diapers, a pair of everyday shoes, find a good doctor or dentist, walk to a few great playgrounds and a nice safe park.<br /><br />I much prefer having a great place to live than having a place that gets crowded with people who don&#39;t respect *our* lifestyle.<br /><br />Just my 2 cents worth on a crappy, depressing rainy Sunday.<br /><br />&nbsp;:-(<br /><br />NYCMacUser<br />

				I *need* to answer Jen.<br /><br />Okay. Okay. I *am* in an especially bitchy mood—and this weather isn&#39;t helping my arthritis!<br /><br />YOU WIN! Yep, that&#39;s right. YOU WIN. The schools suck. But, please don&#39;t blame the residents or the neighborhood. Put the blame where it belongs. THE BOARD OF EDUCATION. When a school district is stable they get ignored. When they have a lot of crime, they get the biggest bucks. So, what does *that* prove? <br /><br />In 1978, when my twins sons were 8 years old, I found myself at a political event with the then PS 17 Principal; Stuart Gale. We talked about a lot of things and then I questioned him about the ethnic mix of the school. He gave me some figures . . . and I stopped him in his tracks. He said there were 4 Jewish children in his school. 4? That&#39;s not possible. I had 2 of my own. <br /><br />Two weeks later, I transferred my boys to a private school in Manhattan. In fact they both graduated high school from Manhattan private schools. I worked 60-70 hours a week to be able to afford the schools. As I saw it, my choices were simple: move or pay for private well-mixed schools.<br /><br />BTW, my boys were given partial financial scholarships each year.<br /><br />So, as I they tell the story now—they had the best of both worlds. They got a really fine education in their Manhattan schools and hanging around with their local friends they learned to strip a Lincoln in 48 seconds!<br /><br />&nbsp;:evil:<br /><br />NYCMacUser

				I don&#39;t know, I guess I like Queens exactly for the reasons that someone would prefer Williamsburg or Greenpoint over it. &nbsp;Everyone has their own preferences and certainly Astoria can&#39;t satisfy everyone. &nbsp;I appreciate the diversity of the area and yes the food is amazing here. &nbsp;Don&#39;t have a kid, so don&#39;t know much about the schools here. &nbsp;I kinda think my area&#39;s beautiful but I do live more towards the park so that&#39;s probably why. &nbsp;Used to live right on Ditmars which was pretty damn loud with all the trucks and endless traffic. &nbsp;But you get that anywhere. &nbsp;I find Williamsburg ugly for all it factories, but that&#39;s just me. &nbsp;What I fear is what is slowly already happening. &nbsp;I can&#39;t afford to live in Brooklyn, why?- because the rent is so high. &nbsp;I can still afford Astoria, and the whole Greek charm has grown on me over the years. &nbsp;Yeah, I hate the smoking in the bars, but I&#39;ve getting over it. &nbsp;Grudgingly. &nbsp;But Astoria is getting ridiculously expensive. &nbsp;All the new buildings charge $1300 for a closet space, and in some cases you pay for heat and hot water. &nbsp;You&#39;re better off renting a house if you can - with a good landlord, which is luck of the draw. &nbsp;Everytime a locally-owned store goes out of business here, it&#39;s replaced by yet another corporate chain. &nbsp;The rent is so high, a chain is the only thing that can afford it. &nbsp;It&#39;s beginning to look just like everywhere else, which is kinda boring. &nbsp;But I love it here, and I hang on. &nbsp;Astoria may be more resistant to the whole hipster, art, music scene perhaps due to the fact that it is more family oriented. &nbsp;So yeah, I travel for that. &nbsp;But I&#39;m okay with that - astoria can&#39;t have it all. &nbsp; :-)

				Well, yes, the schools here aren&#39;t the best. The school issue is far and away&nbsp; the most frustrating issue in what&#39;s otherwise a pretty good neighbrohood for families. Overcrowding is a huge issue and the number of immigrant kids with limited English proficiency puts a huge strain on the system here. On the other hand, they&#39;re not the worst either. Lorrie is right that the problems with the NYC DOE are not unique to this neighborhood. In fact, Astoria schools are actually better than schools in most areas <strong>with comparable prices &amp; rents</strong>. They&#39;re definitely better than schools in Williamsburg. So, sure, there are better schools in Brooklyn Heights and Bayside and the UWS, but that&#39;s really apples and oranges.<br /><br />Some practical advice: theoretically, there&#39;s school choice throughout the system. (Obviously, this doesn&#39;t work in practice for every family.) PS 122 (ditmars &amp;21st) consistently does well on standardized tests; Our World Neighborhood Charter School (35th ave and 36 st) is another good option;&nbsp; PS 78 (in Queens West, in LIC) does have the kinds of parents with enough clout to advocate for things so they have some more innovative programs; a lot of people have found that their huge, ugly ,old local schools have some good teachers and are not so bad if you get involved. Some parents in the neighborhood send their kids to public schools in Manhattan. They either take the subway in or figure that paying for a private bus is still less than private school or manhattan rent.<br /><br />Oh, but I&#39;m so with you on the bookstore issue, Jennifer<br /><br /><br />

				There isn&#39;t some mysterious master-planner that imposes the glut of 99-cent crap stores on neighborhoods that in reality aspire for glorious high-brow bookstores... Astoria is just another perfect example of market forces: the demand of the neighborhood is obviously not really for bookstores. I have come to accept this. Yeah yeah yeah all of us want Seaburn to actually spawn a functional, more involved store. But who are we? Clearly not the majority. Because the majority likes their 99-cent crap stores and discount beauty supply shacks and nasty smoky euro-cafe-bars, that is why they keep popping up. <br /><br />Thus, I agree with Jennifer. Its perfectly ok to wish that we had a little more commercial diversity while still touting the inherent virtues of Astoria. No commercial district should put all its eggs in one basket, be it a string of blighted Starbucks or a dozen 99-cent crap stores in a row...<br /><br />Ask yourself this: why do the eurobars on Broadway continually close-down only to open as yet another generic eurobar of the exact same vein but under a different name? Why didn&#39;t Plaka Cafe at B&#39;way and 34th become that coveted bookstore instead of &quot;Tre&quot; cafe (basically identical to Plaka)?? Because people dont want books. Its just the hard reality of it. <br /><br />A lot of Astoria residents are not english-first-language, much less 18th century literature majors looking for a book club. The extent of the reading I see in my neighborhood is The Post, and its well-established that&#39;s written at a 6th grade-comprehension level. Most Astorians apparently want cheap dispoable goods and frappes tasting of cigars. The people have spoken and not even literate bourgeois pigs like me are chaging it too much. <br /><br />THIS in fact is the main antagonistic force against rampant gentrification (as is petty crime, admittedly).

				Up until the 60&#39;s Steinway was a<em> real</em> marketplace, with what almost became a promenade over the weekends: families walking, taking in the sights, high-end department stores next to discount stationers and real lunch counters and coffee shops... it was a destination. well at least thats what the Astoria Historical Society says on its webpage. Now its just where the Gap, Inc sends its crappiest back-stock of outdated styles, to be hawked to the random few who actually wander in. That and all the crappy cell-phone/discount jewelry stores... ugh. I agree with the sentiment on the obnoxious music (and eyesore storefronts to go along with it)

				The problem with Astoria is that, for me, it gets too noisy when the weather warms up.&nbsp; Too many people (?) blasting bad music from their vehicles.&nbsp; Too many young boys feel the need to get attention and make a statement.&nbsp; I wish, for once, the police would do something.&nbsp; Give out tickets.<br />Why doesn&#39;t that politician Vallone do something.&nbsp; He&#39;s always talking about quality of life issues like grafitti.&nbsp; The quality of life in Astoria sucks.

				I recommend taking a trip to other neighborhoods in Queens, Brooklyn or the Bronx. We have it pretty good here...<br /><br />And as far as Steinway Street goes, with the stores, the noise and the poop, etc. -- go check out 5th Avenue in Sunset Park (Brooklyn) and be grateful.&nbsp; :lol: My family is from there.

				I have lived here for 30 years, and when I discovered Astoria, it was a wonderful place. It was the best of both worlds, a few minutes from Manhattan, but unlike parts of the south Bronx or Jersey, or downtown Brooklyn that were next door to &#39;the rock&#39;, not trashed. Cheap rent, good food, clean steets, quiet in the airshaft. Which the exception of good food, that is no longer the picture.<br />&nbsp;<br />In Astoria, as the rest of Queens, a small clique controls everything. What you read in the media, how funding is given to programs, how the community goes forward was (and is) decided in smoke filled rooms. There is the fig leaf of public participation, but most of it is staged. They don&#39;t particular like, or understand (and therefore fear) hipsters or some of the young people that are moving into the neighborhood. They dread change. <br /><br />Unfortunately, no group of people can forever be at the cusp of good influence. This same old guard who protected Astoria from some of the unpleasant changes that hit other areas (in the 60s, 70s, 80s) are now is a straight jacket that stifles forward progress in the community. This is why the same old tired formular is applied to shopping, entertainment, the very image of this community.<br /><br />Everything changes. You cannot live in 1968 forever. And the future of Astoria is one of two directions: Hoboken, or Elmhurst.<br />&nbsp;<br />Manhattan people always thought they were in a class by themselves, and Astoria was regarded a place you grow up and move away from (or sometimes stay). The problem is that rather than competing with Brooklyn as the second borough, we are now facing the bottom against a resurgent Bronx. Yes, if you compare us with the worst, we still look great. But the direction of Queens in general, and Astoria in particular is clear to us long termers. <br /><br />All you need to do is go out to central Queens to see our communty&#39;s (potential) future: poor planning, ugly out-of-scale buildings, a community of transients where you get the sense that people are yearning for someplace else.<br />&nbsp;<br />Enough for now, will elaborate in further posts. These comments are meant to further discussion not to assign blame or insult. <br /><br />Some of the views reflected in this post are some of the most refeshing comments I have seen in quite some time. By all means, continue them. <br /><br />Is not the freedom of the internet great?<br /><br />

				http://www.therealdeal.net/issues/February_2005/1107828485.php<br /><br />February 2005<br /><strong>Astoria: The Last Cheap, Hip ‘Hood?<br /></strong><em>By Dorn Townsend<br /></em><br />New Yorkers love a bargain, but news of a good deal usually means one has to act fast to find a cheap place to live.<br /><br />Astoria, the traditionally Greek neighborhood in Queens, proves a happy exception to the rule. After a half-decade as a somewhat second-tier destination for new arrivals and refugees from high Manhattan rents, the increasingly hip ‘hood still has plenty of low rents, bargain sale prices and plenty of space in the brick-faced apartment buildings flanking its tree-lined boulevards.<br /><br />&quot;Once my boyfriend and I decided to move in together, we realized that neither of our apartments were really big enough for two, and we started looking all over Manhattan and in Brooklyn,&quot; said Astrid Conway, an advertising copywriter and recent transplant to Astoria. &quot;What we could get with our budget was totally depressing, but when we visited Astoria we just couldn’t believe what we saw.&quot;<br /><br />What they saw is a lively, multi-ethnic neighborhood a 15-minute subway ride from Midtown, but with comparative price differences that are a happy shock to prospective arrivals. While tiny one-bedroom rentals in many parts of Brooklyn and Manhattan average upwards of $1,800 a month, a similar space in Astoria rents for around $1,100.<br /><br />The cost of buying is also a relative bargain. According to Jorge Alberto Perez, a sales associate for the Corcoran Group, the Manhattan-based brokerage which has begun diverting some of its clients looking for more affordable housing to parts of Queens, buyers can double their space for the same price. He said one client who had logged months of fruitless searching for a two-bedroom condo in Manhattan found a three-bedroom home with a backyard and balcony in Astoria for $570,000.<br /><br />&quot;There’s so many great values out there, it’s like the wild, wild west of New York City real estate,&quot; said Perez. &quot;When I take my clients here, they just can’t believe it. The difference in what you get for the same amount of money is amazing.&quot;<br /><br />Indeed, in the last several years as Manhattan and Brooklyn prices have rocketed upwards, a survey of a half-dozen Astoria brokers indicates that over the same period the cost of renting or buying in Astoria has not dramatically changed.<br /><br />Housing options are also expanding as a handful of new buildings go up and former warehouses and factories get converted into apartments. Local brokers said nearly all these new apartments are slated to be rental properties. New buildings, like the condos being developed by Bridgeside Developments on Astoria Boulevard, are primarily concentrated on commercial avenues. Several factories and warehouses are also being converted for residential use. Particularly active is the Pistilli Realty Group, which is converting several industrial buildings into condominiums.<br /><br />&quot;After Sept. 11 rents rose about 10 percent, but since then they have stabilized,&quot; said Demetrius Partridge, an Astoria broker. &quot;There’s a lot of interest here, and nothing stays on the market too long.&quot;<br /><br />What is changing in Astoria is the demographic make-up of the community. For decades this enclave of blue-collar workers, Greek-Americans, and immigrants, particularly from South Asia and Brazil, was often perceived by professional New Yorkers as being situated on the wrong side of the tracks. At best, it was an interesting destination for an afternoon’s anthropological walkabout, but not a serious place to consider moving. Over the past five years or so, plenty of Astrid Conways have colonized swathes of the neighborhood, slowly injecting it with elements of the edgy panache of Park Slope or Williamsburg.<br /><br />&quot;I’d say that recently most of my clients have been young Americans,&quot; said Partridge.<br /><br />Beyond the inexpensive rents and its proximity to Midtown Manhattan, what is attracting them are Astoria’s numerous cultural offerings, like the Museum of the Moving Image and the Socrates Sculpture Park. Commercial thoroughfares offer diners a virtual United Nations of restaurant options. In the last two years residents say the range of commercial choices has expanded as shops replace corner delis, while garages close and mutate into hip bars with black lights, live-music nights and visiting DJs.<br /><br />&quot;It’s amazing because when we get up on weekends we have just as many restaurant choices as we did where we lived in Manhattan,&quot; said Conway. &quot;We don’t feel like we really have to leave our neighborhood to do something interesting.&quot;<br /><br />While Astoria’s real estate prices have largely remained stable since 2001, many brokers predict an escalation as interest in the neighborhood grows.<br /><br />Just as gentrification is altering Williamsburg, Greenpoint and Long Island City, brokers said Astoria, with its abundance of Tudor apartment buildings and convenient subway access to Manhattan, is poised for a boom. If New York wins the 2012 Olympics, Astoria will be thrust into the spotlight, as large stretches of its waterfront become venues for rowing and swimming.<br /><br />&quot;The value of property will go up, as more and more Manhattan money comes into the neighborhood,&quot; said Perez. &quot;What’s happening in Astoria is still a bit of a secret, but that information will get shared.&quot;<br /><br />NYCMacUser

				Thanks NYC Mac User!<br /><br />This is exactly the kind of thing I was alluding to. The image of the community is subject to spin, as in this case, to attact real estate investors.<br /><br />Old residents: is Astoria like it use to be?<br /><br />New residents: is the piece accurate - Astoria rents are cheap?<br /><br />There is a huge gap betweem myth and reality, between public statements, and the man on the street.

				I guess this just abou sums it up.<br /><br />http://www.myastoria.com/history/<br /><br />Today, Astoria is a multicultural haven for people from all corners of <br />the earth. On a per capita basis, Long Island City and Astoria are some <br />of the safest neighborhoods in all of New York City. The neighborhood&#39;s <br />architecture reflects its rich past: a hodgepodge of prewar apartment <br />buildings, renovated row houses, brick tenements, and two family <br />houses combine the old with the new. Partly due to the strong immigrant <br />influence, the presence of the film industry, and the recent surge of <br />Manhattan expatriates, today&#39;s Astoria enjoys a variety of robust small <br />businesses, ethnic dining, bargain shopping, and trendy nightlife.<br /><br />NYCMacUser

				These posts have been lively and entertaining!<br /><br />I&#39;m a massive fan of Astoria for many reasons but its got problems like all of NYC - it just fits my needs.&nbsp; One of the reasons I love reading these posts so much is that I am that &quot;yuppie&quot; several of the users complain so much about.&nbsp; Yep, I am willing to pay more for things, especially if it means getting a landlord who maintains his property well and will do renovations.&nbsp; &nbsp;(I don&#39;t have that landlord now sadly - he&#39;s the laziest s.o.b. on earth and a bit of a swindler)&nbsp; I also really love having a Starbucks in walking distance and frankly, really can&#39;t stand all of the complaining people do about it.&nbsp; Its one of the only companies I can think of that hires unskilled workers and then trains them, promotes them, offers tuition reimbursement AND healthcare.&nbsp; &nbsp;I keep my car parked on street but am actively looking for a garage and all of my Manhattan/Brooklyn friends come and visit me at the Garden.&nbsp; &nbsp;Since we drink a lot, we are probably responsible for at least 3% of those lines.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#39;m sorry that the area is losing its old character but at the same time, I&#39;m happy for the businesses and property owners that have gained from the changes and will continue to benefit as the area continues to change.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Things I love:&nbsp; L&#39;incontro, Starbucks, the jewelry store, Fatty&#39;s, the BG, Brick Cafe, Kyclades, Astoria bagel, and many more.<br />
