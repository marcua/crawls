				Has anyone done the free pilates and yoga classes at the Sculpture park? I want to go but don&#039;t have anyone else to go with and don&#039;t have any experience with either. If anyone has gone can you give me some basic info?<br /><br />Thanks

				I try to take the pilates every Sunday and it&#039;s amazing.&nbsp; They have different instructors most of the time but they are all wonderfully patient and very knowledgeable. I don&#039;t know about yoga, but the pilates is set up for both beginners and advanced, so you don&#039;t need experience.&nbsp; It&#039;s right on the park by the water on a Sunday morning, and it&#039;s incredibly peaceful and relaxing.&nbsp; Can&#039;t say enough good things about this class.&nbsp; It takes me forever to get to Socrates, but to me, it&#039;s worth it.

				I&#039;ve been going to the yoga classes on Saturdays this summer for the first time. The instructor is great, and she&#039;s very focused on proper alignment which is important. When you say you don&#039;t have any experience, do you mean you&#039;ve never done yoga and pilates or never done them in a park? I&#039;m not sure that I would start with yoga in the park for my very first yoga class ever, as doing the poses on the uneven ground is a little more challenging than in a studio and it&#039;s a large class with less opportunity for the instructor to focus on you and correct your poses. On the other hand, I don&#039;t think it would be detrimental, and hey, it&#039;s free! I do find the classes really great, challenging and relaxing at the same time. You definitely don&#039;t need someone to go with--you can just show up and put down your mat or towel (AND WATER), sit quietly until the class starts and leave when it&#039;s over. People aren&#039;t really all hanging out and chatting beforehand--it&#039;s a rather quiet environment. I think probably half the people there come alone. <br /><br />Supposedly there&#039;s a Facebook page or group that the instructor is setting up, but I couldn&#039;t find it and haven&#039;t received any emails about it yet.
