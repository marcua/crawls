				Has anyone checked out the new speakeasy on Ditmars near 33rd st? I know this genre is a little tired but I went on Friday after work and really liked it. Prices are expensive but the quality of the drinks I had was excellent. Small bites also available...

				Very limited but tasty. They have charcuterie and stuffed grape leaves and the like. Pretty good and ~ $10.

				Sounds interesting, but like a bit of a novelty. If they are charging $13-$16 for cocktails and requiring such a process to even get in the door, they may have difficulty lasting long in Astoria, IMO.

Do they have the right kind of population, and enough of it, to sustain themselves long term? I&#039;m skeptical.

				Don&#039;t get me wrong, this place sounds intriguing and I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll check it out. But in order to stick around, they need a ton of people coming once in a while or a core group of people coming all the time. Given the demographics, population, and cost...I think it will be challenging.

				I hear what you are saying. Front Toward Enemy tried this tactic and failed. However, I think this place fits in with a new Ditmars Blvd scene. I think they&#039;ll do well.

				We were curious and went on Friday to try it out.<br /><br /><br />The drinks were very tasty and interesting.&nbsp; The atmosphere is very comfortable.&nbsp; Music not too loud, good seating, etc. <br /><br /><br />Great date-night place.

				<br />I always said I&#039;d never go to this place...that it seemed they were trying to hard ...you know, &#039;hipsters&#039;.&nbsp; ;-)<br /><br />But I&#039;d heard so many good things, that I finally gave it a try.<br /><br />Check-in process was pretty easy.&nbsp; At around 900p on a Friday we arrived, gave our cell #, and in about 15 mins. received a text that a table was ready for us.&nbsp; &#039;Hostess&#039; brought us to our table.<br /><br />Pros:&nbsp; great drinks, nice chill ambiance, not too crowded (clearly they pace the crowd so that it&#039;s never crowded), low noise level meant you could have conversation, and music playlist was great<br /><br />Cons: as I suspected, the people who work here just scream Wiliamsburg/Bushwick.&nbsp; The hostess looked like she was plucked right out of an episode of &#039;Girls&#039;, and the bartenders had the prerequisite lumberjack beards, tattoos, and very carefully rolled-up white shirt sleeves (....you know...so you could see those cool tats of theirs....)&nbsp; ;-)<br /><br />Would I go back?&nbsp; Yes, actually I would... as I really liked the chill vibe and the elegant drinks.&nbsp; A great place to take out-of-town guests.
