				I have my doubts as to whether the alleged stimulus package will actually work.&nbsp; It is loaded with provisions that won&#039;t actually stimulate the economy, but will cost the federal taxpayer a hefty sum.&nbsp; Some examples: funding for road maintenance that would otherwise be left to states and localities, and funding for government employees (the only sector where employment numbers are not hurting!).&nbsp; How this package will spur the economy is beyond me.&nbsp; It just illustrates that Congress is not a body of economic experts.<br /><br />But, whether you&#039;re for or against the stimulus, it is good to know how much it will cost you, the taxpayer.&nbsp; Of course, numbers are just an abstraction.&nbsp; How many of us really know what constitutes a billion?&nbsp; So I commend to you this ingenious chart: http://www.suitablyflip.com/suitably_flip/2009/01/stimulus-illustrated.html<br /><br />It compares the cost of the stimulus plan to other expensive projects in American history.&nbsp; My personal highlight: <em>It&#039;s bigger than the New Deal and the Iraq War combined.</em><br /><br />Also of note: <em>The only relatively modest component of the spending bonanza is the money tagged for infrastructure and energy efficiency (the ostensibly stimulative part), which accounts for less than 14% of the total.</em><br /><br />Thanks, Congress!&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />

				I have two problems here (just two?): First is that it is not stimulative. This WSJ op-ed reports that 12 cents for every dollar of this bill could even remotely be considered stimulative. <br />http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123310466514522309.html<br />Second, it lumps political spending, which should be debated in appropriations negotiations, in with an &quot;emergency bill.

				I noticed that someone thumbed Sweeper and I down.&#160; I&#039;d be seriously interested to know what that person&#039;s gripe is.&#160; Although figures are open to some degree of interpretation, they don&#039;t lie.&#160; As Sweeper and I understand the data, that stimulus package won&#039;t be stimulative, and it will cost the taxpayers a mint.&nbsp; In a way, I feel depressed, because I know that what congress is doing will likely make things worse, and there is nothing I can do to help people.&nbsp; I know that there will be opportunity in the ashes, but that is cold comfort.<br /><br />Is the problem with our argument that we&#039;re not being hopeful enough?&#160; There is data to suggest that the stimulus is only digging us deeper into the hole.&#160; Seriously, what is the contra argument held by the thumbs downer?&nbsp; Was the thumbs down just a drive by, reflexively pro-bama thing?

I think that about half the population works, so you could double that to $6000, if you like. $150,000 is something like three or four times the median income in this country, so I&#039;m not sure what you&#039;re trying to argue... I&#039;m certainly not going to end up paying anything like that. If you are, lucky you.

I think it is very helpful to see a private initiative looking at where or if the money would be invested.<br /><br />I would like to follow the details of how much goes towards tax cuts, what kind, and when. Most reports note about $20 a month &#039;tax cut&#039; per person starting around June. Then how much goes towards actual investments? Most of the spending is probably better than the Iraq expenses.<br />And then how much is for grants for states or cities to cover other govt. programs? There, it seems to be a question whether taxes would be increased at the federal or more local levels. Though there merits many spending cuts.<br /><br />You may know from my perpsective that these spending programs form a plan to rob more (or tax) from some neighbors for the possible benefit of a few or many. I do not support that.<br /><br />Remember too that Keynes said you could spend your way to recovery just by digging and filling holes. If so, would rather spend as least as possible.<br /><br />But truth be told, I would voluntarily pay a little more in taxes for some of the programs, but not the legislation as proposed. They should make many improvements before voting.<br /><br />There is likely to be quite a bit of heat on both sides of the plan.

You guessed it. Government. <br /><br />Zandi (who made a point of saying he&#039;s a registered Democrat despite his stint with McCain; he has been wrongly tagged as a &quot;conservative Republican&quot;) is a big promoter of the stimulus package, which he called &quot;a reasonably efficacious piece of legislation.&quot; <br /><br />Given his druthers, it would actually be a lot bigger and include more tax cuts because, according to Zandi, the effects of getting money into the hands of people who could use it would be more immediately felt than spending on infrastructure.<br /><br />If the government acts the way it should, Zandi predicted Americans will be feeling a lot better by 2011. The recession will end this year (in 2009), he said, but things won&#039;t actually feel like they&#039;re improving for quite some time. <br /><br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Yes, it is a work in progress. Maybe the tax cut side will be improved before all is said and done.<br />Recent estimates were that 80% of the package, if passed, would be in effect by end of 2010.<br /><br />http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.R.1 :<br /><br />For some of the early work and proposals.<br /><br />Then eventually (hopefully?)<br /><br />http://www.recovery.gov/

				There is another pending legislation that has just been added to the stimulus package!<br /><br />The Americans With No Abilities Act<br /><br />Washington, DC—Congress is considering sweeping legislation that will provide new benefits for many Americans: The Americans With No Abilities Act.<br /><br />(AWNAA) is being hailed as a major legislative goal by advocates of the millions of Americans who lack any real skills or ambition.<br /><br />&quot;Roughly 50 percent of Americans do not possess the competence and drive necessary to carve out a meaningful role for themselves in society,&quot; said California Senator Barbara Boxer. &quot;We can no longer stand by and allow People of Inability to be ridiculed and passed over. With this legislation, employers will no longer be able to grant special favors to a small group of workers, simply because they have some idea of what they are doing.&quot;<br /><br />In a Capitol Hill press conference, House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D) and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D) pointed to the success of the U.S. Postal Service, which has a long-standing policy of providing opportunity without regard to performance. Approximately 74 percent of postal employees lack any job skills, making this agency the single largest U.S. employer of Persons of Inability.<br /><br />Private-sector industries with good records of non-discrimination against the Inept include retail sales (72%), the limo industry (68%), and home improvement &#039;warehouse&#039; stores (65%). At the state government level, the Department of Motor Vehicles also has an excellent record of hiring Persons of Inability (a whopping 83%).<br /><br />Under The Americans With No Abilities Act, more than 25 million &quot;middle man&quot; positions will be created, with important-sounding titles but little real responsibility, thus providing an illusory sense of purpose and performance.<br /><br />Mandatory non-performance-based raises and promotions will be given so as to guarantee upward mobility for even the most inept employees.&nbsp; The legislation provides substantial tax breaks to corporations that promote a significant number of Persons of Inability into middle-management positions, and gives a tax credit to small and medium-sized businesses that agree to hire one clueless worker for every two talented hires.<br /><br />Finally, the AWNAA contains tough new measures to make it more difficult to discriminate against the non-abled, banning, for example, discriminatory interview questions such as, &quot;Do you have any skills or experience that relate to this job?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;As a non-abled person, I can&#039;t be expected to keep up with people who have something going for them,&quot; said Mary Lou Greason, who lost her position as a lug-nut twister at the GM plant in Flint, Michigan, due to her inability to remember &#039;rightey tightey, lefty loosey.&#039; &quot;This new law should be real good for people like me,&#039; Greason added. With the passage of this bill, Greason and millions of other untalented citizens will finally see a light at the end of the tunnel.<br /><br />Said Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL): &quot;As a Senator with no abilities, I believe the same privileges that elected officials enjoy ought to be extended to every American with no abilities. It is our duty as lawmakers to provide each and every American citizen, regardless of his or her inadequacy, with some sort of space to take up in this great nation and a good salary for doing so.&quot;<br /><br />

				Well, I know&nbsp; what it&#039;s going to cost me and others&nbsp; stuck in the middle who rarely used credit cards and lived within their means. It will&nbsp; be people&nbsp; like me who will have to bail out the mortgages&nbsp; that never should have&nbsp; been approved, which is&nbsp; the crux of the problem. Shades&nbsp; of&nbsp; things to&nbsp; come happned&nbsp; last week to me. I have a small piece of property, and&nbsp; as any good little&nbsp; Marxist&nbsp; in NYC will tell you, &#039;property is theft&#039;, unless&nbsp; its&#039; owned&nbsp; by &#039;artists&#039;&nbsp; and people who agree with them.&nbsp; :wink:&nbsp; Anyway, it appears&nbsp; I am being audited, funny thing is, several people&nbsp; in this area I know, are also being audited and our only similarities it seems is we belong to&nbsp; the Republican party, hmm? :?&nbsp; I&#039;m not getting Mickey Moore about it, but, it just seems odd, a couple of months after&nbsp; the entire&nbsp; state became a one party state with local newspapers&nbsp; calling for the &#039;breaking of legs&#039; of those&nbsp; who may owe&nbsp; taxes. So, what&nbsp; have they come up with so far, the property&nbsp; I own, given to me by my parents&nbsp; in upstate&nbsp; NY, which&nbsp; I offered and received&nbsp; a&nbsp; &#039;Designated Forrest&#039; Tax break, was&nbsp; not in &#039;compliance.&#039; What was the &#039;non-complaince?&#039; When you go into the program, you agree not to develop the land so it won&#039;t pollute drinking water for&nbsp; NYC&nbsp; in exchange&nbsp; you get a partial tax break you have to apply some forms&nbsp; every year with an updated&nbsp; &#039;thinning plan&#039; where&nbsp; fire hazard&nbsp; trees are thinned&nbsp; out. I did that&nbsp; 6 years ago and paid the tax. I got a letter&nbsp; disputing the figure&nbsp; I paid tax on, with a threat of an audit. Since, I can&#039;t find&nbsp; what i paid, receipt, I either&nbsp; pay the amount they want with a penalty, or they compound it every 30 days for starters. They sent this letter, dated&nbsp; 25 days&nbsp; ago, this friday, I spent all weekend&nbsp; looking for&nbsp; the receipt, and Monday they are closed, effectively getting razor close&nbsp; to 30 days&nbsp; to answer. Yes, folks, one of many ways&nbsp; those trying to maintain a small slice&nbsp; of the American&nbsp; dream, land ownership being&nbsp; one, are being taken to the cleaners&nbsp; to make America&nbsp; safe&nbsp; for&nbsp; the deadbeats&nbsp; and the flood of illegals. I have to admit, there is &#039;change&#039;&nbsp; in the air, I feel&nbsp; a&nbsp; chill.&nbsp; :-(

				I consider this very significant, and usually the govt is not very forward regarding budget matters.

It is a test of our commitment to making America what it was always meant to be: a place where all things are possible for all people.&quot; <br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If Obama would be sincere to end funding where govt. does not work as well as the private sector . . . <br />&nbsp;:?<br />&nbsp;:cry:<br /><br />http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It projects a $1.75 trillion deficit, representing 12.3% of GDP, which is the highest level since World War II.<br />...<br /><br />This budget is very tough on those who earn more than $250,000 a year.

Equally interesting, the government will now budget for $20 billion/year in payments to states and localities for emergency funds for natural disasters, instead of pretending that we don&#039;t have any idea how much these things cost us! Now that&#039;s how you run a government!

This is taxation by an indirect means. So what really happens here is: Your energy rates increase to pay for a system that enriches the already wealthy while doing nothing positive for the &quot;environment&quot;. They will then say &quot;but we are investing this money to make your life better&quot;. But the truth is, they are not. They are giving grants to politically connected societal parasites who then steer reelection funds back to the entrenched incumbents.<br />For exhibit &quot;A&quot; let&#039;s start with ethanol.<br />The climate change myth has thankfully almost run it&#039;s course. But that won&#039;t stop those who enrich themselves on it from taking every dollar they can get while they still can.
