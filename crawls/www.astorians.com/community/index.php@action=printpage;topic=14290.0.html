				Can anyone recommend a good and inexpensive framer in Astoria, preferably around the Ditmars area?&nbsp; I&#039;m not an artist but I have several pieces I want framed.&nbsp; I&#039;d like someone who can advise me on the best frame for each painting -- that&#039;s what I mean by good&nbsp; &nbsp;-- and I can&#039;t afford to spend a fortune.&nbsp; Thanks for any suggestions.

				I&#039;d be really interested in finding one too rene0226, I&#039;m in the same boat. I have a bunch of new pieces (nothing special), but cant spend a whole lot getting them framed. I&#039;m originally from upstate, and am used to getting stuff framed up there at places like Michaels Crafts. There is one in Woodside, and though I havent been to that specific one, there is usually a great custom framing section of the store. If you check their website, they have a lot of coupons. Two weeks ago they had 55% off custom framing, but I wasnt able to get out there. Hope this helps, let me know what you find out.

				I&#039;m interested in this as well.&nbsp; I have a painting I&#039;m doing, that I&#039;ll want to have framed.&nbsp; There is a guy on 31 Street, near the Ditmars train, has anyone been there?&nbsp; I want to know I can trust them with my art.

				Thanks for the tip on the one in Woodside; I may check that out.&nbsp; As far as the guy on 31st by Ditmars, I&#039;ve passed by there but never gone in so no information.&nbsp; I&#039;ll post if I find anything.

				There is a small frame shop on Broadway across the street from C-Town (I can&#039;t remember the exact location, but it&#039;s the only one in that area). We had a bunch of really old maps that my boyfriend wanted framed, plus two generic posters we really liked, and we got them framed there. The guy did a gorgeous job. He really helped us pick out appropriate mattes and frames. We weren&#039;t really in a hurry to get them back or anything, but he said he&#039;d get them back framed to us in two weeks. (He had to order the wood.) On the day we were given to pick them up, he didn&#039;t have them ready, which we didn&#039;t care. But when we paid, he threw in a really nice picture frame, too. I highly recommend him, and his prices were reasonable.

				Oops! I didn&#039;t realize there were multiple C-Towns on Broadway (I&#039;m still new-ish!)! It&#039;s the one down by the NW train, near 29th Street.

				I just walked by the place today. It&#039;s right next to Blockbuster. I can&#039;t remember the name now, but I believe it&#039;s Pearl.

				I checked the place on 31st bw Ditmars and 23rd.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t find the place particularly helpful.&nbsp; A salesgirl basically told me to pick frames and she&#039;d check the price.&nbsp; The framer was there, but didn&#039;t make a move.&nbsp; Turns out framing is at least 95 dollars, and well, in this economy, that ain&#039;t happening for me.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; I have no idea if that&#039;s normal for framing but if it is, I guess I won&#039;t be able to get things professionally framed.&nbsp; That&#039;s too bad.
