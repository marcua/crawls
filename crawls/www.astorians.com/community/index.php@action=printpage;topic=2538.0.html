				Does anybody know what&#39;s going on with the two Pistlli-owned properties in Astoria - the former Eagle Electric Company on 21st and the former Stern&#39;s Warehouse on Ditmars and 45th?&nbsp; I&#39;ve called the office, but all you can do is fax them your information and they say they&#39;ll contact you when they have any updates to report.<br /><br />I did a whole bunch of Googling but couldn&#39;t find anything terribly recent - just a report about them promising some senior citizen&#39;s housing for the Ditmars property.&nbsp; I see people working at both properties at random times, but they don&#39;t look anywhere near done, and weren&#39;t they supposed to be ready by now?<br /><br />Any thoughts are appreciated!

				Having been at the mercy of much construction on the UC Berkeley campus (we used to joke that &quot;UC&quot; instead of meaning &quot;University of California&quot; it meant &quot;Under Construction&quot;), big projects always seem to take more time than originally allotted.&nbsp; I wonder if this is a similar case....?

				Ah yes, seem to remember a picture in the newspapers a summer or two ago of a bunch of happy campers at a BBQ. If memory serves me correctly, it was the Vallones and Pistillis. <br /><br />Do not know if its true that the former was interested in apartments in the latter&#39;s building. Almost certain the latter made campaign contributions to the former.<br /><br />Someone told me (who is on the community board) that there were, shall we delicately say, cash flow problems? I don&#39;t know. <br /><br />Would he dare use non-union labor in an area so staunchly pro-labor? hmmm. <br /><br />But I can say for certain that an architect from California I know was horrified at what he termed the &#39;mutilation&#39; of the old Steinway factory. He said that the junk they sprayed&nbsp; on the outside is a cheap insulation that traps moisture and deteriorates the underlying wall. He further claimed it is banned in Florida and other places. <br /><br />The key thing after that improvement (some would say mutilation), is that they can never landmark the building. That&#39;s one nasty thing Astoria don&#39;t need, right?<br /><br />And that Astoria Park effort looks like a cruise ship on steroids. If there are senior residences, are there some tax breaks or subsidies?<br /><br />For another example of his rarefied taste, check out the former L I Savings Bank on 30th Ave. Ten years ago it was a beautiful gem with an adjoining park. Now it looks like the corporate headquarters for every &#39;upscale&#39; nightspot in the neighborhood.<br /><br />Years ago, if the developers destroyed a neighborhood&#39;s charm, at least they could have been counted on to put up buildings that had some classy style.

				Just to clear up one thing I&#39;ve heard mistakenly said before:&nbsp; the place on Ditmars and 45th is not and never was the Steinway factory.&nbsp; The Steinway factory is still alive and well in its original Astoria location on Steinway Place, which is the continuation of 38th Street north of 19th Ave.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Hell Gate bridge paint is a special paint that was formulated by a German company specifically for the Hell Gate bridge during its refurbishment that was completed in 1996.&nbsp; Its original colour is closer to purple, but it is officially called Hell Gate Red, and don&#39;t try to suggest to any of the people involved in the painting project that it is anything but red (Jim tried).&nbsp; Like all - or most - red-related pigments, it does fade in the sun, hence its pinker appearance over a number of years.&nbsp; Before that it was kind of a rusty (or rusted) black.

				Steinway had two factories. Yes, the Ditmars building was indeed the other Steinway factory. The Ditmars facility was sold in the 1950s and later became the Sterns warehouse.<br /><br />In a community where the arts groups are always starving for space, this building, with its incredible past, (with a tincture of imagination) could have been converted into world class arts workshops, etc. Those factories were built solid, but were never intended as residences (no real insulation, for example).<br /><br />Just think what could have happened had that place been an incubator for the arts community, and the electric effect that population could have had on the surrounding area.<br /><br />Now we have ... well .... what shall we charitably call something like that anyway?

				i think the most &#39;charitable&#39; way to describe the property at 45th and ditmars is an abomination. it looks like a visit to ye olde europe designed by a thirteen year old. trained and having worked as an architect i have many, many, many problems with how they &#39;converted&#39; this building both from a functional and an aesthetic perspective.<br /><br />i used to ride by this building when i first moved to upper ditmars and think, &quot;wow that building has some great bones.&quot; with gigantic windows spaced 10&#39; on center, it would be a perfect place for loft conversion ala soho or brooklyn.<br /><br />instead we have gotten a cheap and many times incorrect application of materials. and also we have gotten a building that started great and was turned into an object that is equal parts casino boat and convalescent home.<br /><br />and to clarify, the exterior finish is known as synthetic stucco (e.i.f.s.) or by the trade name dryvit. in this case it was probably used as a cheap alternative to having to repoint all the mortar (meaning chisel out all the old mortar and replace it with new). it is the least expensive alternative to get a fairly water-tight building exterior. and yes, it is prone to failure and has resulted in many a lawsuit.

				Thanks for all these replies.&nbsp; They&#39;ve been extremely helpful.&nbsp; The more I read, the more sense it makes that updates on both these projects have been kept behind closed doors for the past few years.<br /><br />The whole co-op lease situation on the Eagle site makes me nervous as well.<br /><br />It&#39;ll be interesting to see what eventually happens with either of these, and how much longer it takes.<br /><br />All I wanted to do was live by the park...&nbsp; :roll:

				you should be....<br /><br />don&#39;t be surprised if the deals fall through that they become warehouses for all kinds of interesting folks.<br /><br />Interesting paradox for politicians on development: it often brings in people who don&#39;t vote the &#39;right&#39; way (as they will find out in LIC). Hence the push for &#39;affordable&#39; housing and fear of &#39;gentrification&#39; by the politicians (gotta keep the &#39;right&#39; balance, eh?)

				Interesting.&nbsp; I knew it had been a Sterns warehouse, but that was it.&nbsp; Now I&#39;m going to have to find out what exactly it was used for by Steinway.&nbsp; (Not just &quot;pianos&quot; - which lines?&nbsp; Was it pianos, or another Steinway investment?&nbsp; The Steinway family were involved in more than just pianos.&nbsp; I know this is O/T for this thread; I&#39;m just musing briefly out loud.)

				Saw this:<br />http://www.sherwinbeach.com/lenehan/K2571.htm<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Bogyos worked in various departments at Steinway and studied drafting at night in anticipation of getting a job at Con Edison-- which also had a concert band. The Depression destroyed that possibility. When World War II came, Steinway began making wooden parts for gliding airplanes, and the young draftsman was moved into the pattern shop, which was then undergoing quite a transformation.<br /><br />&quot;When I got into engineering we called it the pattern shop. It was in Ditmars [an ancillary factory building in Astoria, since sold], up on the seventh floor, up in heaven, sort of. You were left alone. And the way they worked it, Frank Walsh, who was my boss at the time, he was the chief engineer, he came up like I did in the factory--from an office boy he became plant manager and engineer. He had his own book, and he just wrote down everything he ever saw, how it was done, how it was made. And every foreman had a little book, like littler than yours, in his back pocket, for his department. It was everything more or less verbal--passed down from son to son, as far as the Steinway family was concerned, and from foreman to foreman. There was no such thing as specifications. There were some drawings, and where there weren&#39;t drawings, they had patterns. And that&#39;s why it was called the pattern shop. The major pattern was hanging on the wall or, if it was small, in some drawer. And if something had to be made, and something happened to the secondary pattern which was in the factory, okay then they came here and we compared, or made a new one from this, et cetera. But there were very little drawings, as we know them today.&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Interesting - I did know that during the War, Steinway made parts for airplanes - pretty sure they did it in their main factory as well.&nbsp; They also made pianos that were designed to be dropped from airplanes (!), to air drop them to the troops.&nbsp; There are hardly any left in existence, but the Steinway factory does have one on display that you can see during a factory tour.

				If those things be true, how did they get their hands on all these prime buildings? Who is asleep at the wheel and lets this happen? <br /><br />And altought taste is personal, why is there never comments on their (ahem) unique style? Indeed, don&#39;t these buildings actually get architectural awards?!?!?!<br /><br />Are the movers and shakers in our community visually tone-deaf?

				I thought I&#039;d share this info...they actually have a website that they have been giving out to prospective buyers.&nbsp; Like, the building, its not quite complete&nbsp; :-D.&nbsp; It does have a couple of floor plans.&nbsp; I am curious about the concierge stuff.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t ask whether this service is included with the coop.<br /><br />http://www.pistilliliving.com/<br /><br />I went there about two weekends ago and the place is looking really nice.&nbsp; They took me up to fairly complete floor (I think its the 7th) and it looked really nice.&nbsp; The broken down stairs (as mentioned in previous postings) has been repaired.&nbsp; I expected that it was going to get fixed up late in the construction since it probably takes most of the pounding.<br /><br />I do share some of the concerns of floor plans in some of the units.&nbsp; I saw 1 bedroom penthouse with 2 walk-in closets...big enough to be a small...bedroom...but because there are no windows, you can&#039;t really use it as such...perhaps an office.&nbsp; Whoever did the design put way too much emphasis on closet space and the living room area....I don&#039;t know why since there is a shared storage space in every floor.&nbsp; We say a layout of a two bedroom where the smaller of the two bedroom is probably not big enough to fit a twin bed...the same apartment has a huge living room...all they had to do was move the wall between the living room and the smaller bedroom to make the decent size bedroom...oh well.&nbsp; &nbsp;I do like the layout of some of the duplex loft.&nbsp; Oh and that loft with a bedroom that has a column in the middle of it...what an eyesore...the loft itself is ok...but passing on that bedroom as a bedroom is a stretch....I don&#039;t know maybe you can make it a kids bedroom and add a smaller loft space inside of it.<br /><br />If you are curious about the place, stop by during the weekends when they have hold an open house.

				This whole thing is a shame.&nbsp; The website is an embarrassment.&nbsp; It&#039;s a great location and was a terrific building with a lot of opportunities.&nbsp; The finishes are terrible.&nbsp; You can literrally punch a whole through the exterior with your fist and then peel off the stryofoam and fake stucco.&nbsp; (I am not recommending it&nbsp; :wink:)&nbsp; I don&#039;t think the building is as ugly as some people do but it took crazy long and has cheap finishes.&nbsp; That would make me nervous to buy.&nbsp; And their inside sales force and now this website... It&#039;s all just very weird to me.&nbsp; All the new condos in LIC use either Corcoran or Elliman.&nbsp; Feelings about brokers aside, the use of a professional agency with a reputation for luxury units does matter.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure there are a lot of people who find this more than a little odd - and walk away from the property.&nbsp; It&#039;s not like they&#039;re the Trumps.&nbsp; Who has heard of Pistilli outside of Astoria?&nbsp; I hope for the sake of the neighborhood that every unit sells and that nice people come into the neighborhood who enjoy the location and add some life to the immediate area.&nbsp; But the odds are not good.&nbsp; It may take as long to fill as it did to finish.&nbsp; And that means it will be 2010 before people live there!&nbsp; The Sterns building seems to have all the same issues.

				The building, its layout, its amenities, and its promotion, does exactly what it sets out to do.<br /><br />They are not looking for professionals from the East Side to cross the river to live. <br /><br />The are looking for local investors to buy up the units, then run them as dormitories.<br /><br />Sort of like the run down second or third story three bedroom unit with a kitchenette and 6 cab drivers/students/whatever of the 80s theme developed to its ultimate conclusion. <br /><br />That building, that location, what a waste.

				I looked around the Eagle property around October. It was very unfinished, and they were planning on having it &quot;ready&quot; in January or February. I had a feeling that they were really off with that estimate. While some of the apartments were nice, others were just functionally wrong. Some had closets bigger than the kitchen area. The realtor asked me if we like to eat out a lot. Then he proceeded to show me an apartment where the kitchen was a u shaped, tiny hole in the wall, with get this- a LARGE column directly in front of it!&nbsp; I wish i would have taken a picture of it.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				The website is completely awful, but it matches the aesthetic of that building! My boyfriend and I did see the apartments, which were ok, if you gutted the kitchen and made it bigger, which you really shouldn&#039;t have to on a brand new building. <br /><br />If you want to see something really cheesy walk by the lobby at night (on 24th ave), they have hot pink and bright yellow track lights in their lobby, it is so awful! I am so glad my bf didn&#039;t by a place in there as I would be so embarassed to invite friends over.<br /><br />FYI: The sales agent (he isn&#039;t an actual realtor from what I&#039;ve seen) told us that the place would be ready in March. My bf and I are betting that it won&#039;t open until July at the earliest.

				I&#039;ve read the prospectus at Riverview/ Eagle and will likely buy a 1 BR...The land purchase is being financed through a wrap mortgage, meaning tennents won&#039;t have to pay out of pocket at that future date.&nbsp; &nbsp; 1-BR start at around $300k and 2-BR at around $450k.&nbsp; &nbsp;If this sounds like a lot, then check out the other Astoria/ LIC developments.&nbsp; The maintenance is high but not really out of line for new coops.&nbsp; BTW, I agree the web site is terrible!!

				I think there is some exageration in some of these posts.&nbsp; My husband and I were amongst the first to have a look at the spaces - these are our impressions -<br /><br />The layouts are a bit odd in the new building.&nbsp; Tiny kitchens, huge closets, lots of light, nice bathrooms.&nbsp; Materials were not impressive and the floor in one of the model spaces was buckling already.<br /><br />They did nothing to &#039;stage&#039; the building, which was a mistake.&nbsp; Bare lightbulbs, rough walls in the hallways, unprofessional staff.<br /><br />The Lofts in the back on the old side of the factory were also a bit odd, but it was a factory after all, and some columns are probably holding the place up.<br /><br />No broken windows.&nbsp; There was one a long time ago that has been repaired.&nbsp; There will not be broken windows once it is occupied.<br /><br />The facade has some wierd red object which looked torn for a while - it was fixed.<br /><br />There was one little bit of graffiti in the back - it was cleaned.<br /><br />Website is a disaster and I personally wrote to the owners about this.&nbsp; They really need to do something.<br /><br />The consensus all over the neighborhood is that while the original factory and the Mansard roof are nice, the front looks like something out of 1970&#039;s Miami Beach.<br /><br />Anyway, I do hope the coops sell - if not, we who live in the neighborhood may have a problem!

				I&#039;ve seen the columns, the small kitchens, the small fridges, etc., as described in the previous posts.&nbsp; So far ~40 apartments have been sold out of 184 since Oct. 2006.&nbsp; So, slowly things are moving along. <br /><br />There are some areas of concern.&nbsp; The information below is what I learned during the visit and gleaned from the internet.<br /><br />The co-op does not own the land, but there is a lease for 49 years.&nbsp; In 5 years (was 10 years when this was set up) the Sponsor will have an option to buy the land.&nbsp; After the land is purchased, the Sponsor will swap the land with the co-op for the ownership of the garage and the commercial/retail space.&nbsp; At this point, the co-op will become a condo-op and the sponsor will own the garage/commercial/retail space and co-op owning the residential part.&nbsp; With the income from the former going solely to the Sponsor.<br /><br />The Sponsor will retain 49% of the board vote.<br /><br />The bank, the First Central Savings Bank, financed the construction and is under sponsor&#039;s control (Pistilli brothers are the CEO and the CFO of the bank.) The bank also provides mortgages for individual buyers (I suspect, it would be more difficult to obtain mortgage from other financial institutions since the sponsor has 49% of the voting power in the condo-op.) The sponsor seems to have a lot of power.<br />

				The bottom line is that it is ugly but it is there.&nbsp; Not much we can do about it, so why moan and groan.&nbsp; It is what it is.&nbsp; Pistilli has the money but not the taste.&nbsp; People are going to live there so let&#039;s respect the fact that they have selected to move to our neighborhood and welcome them instead of criticising them.&nbsp; If you look at the posts on this thread, many of them have been insulting to those folks who purchased apartments in the building.

I&#039;ve lived here all my life and I&#039;m doing just fine! In fact, I find this building offensive in every way possible to this neighborhood. If they had the foresight and skill and brains to keep to the original footprint of the building and put some TREES &amp; GRASS AND OPEN SPACE in the front as opposed to appending a horrendous structure in the front and on top due to their runaway greed, it would have been MUCH MORE HIP TO LIVE IN and much more green and we wouldn&#039;t be havingthis Pistilli debate, or is that not important? Jersey City is just now beginning to treasure its old warehouses after destroying them for years due to overdevelopment and they are a huge success. The other wonderful idea that could have taken place there is building much needed middle-class affordable townhouses with BACKYARDS and GARDENS being more in line with THE REST OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD, so people would take pride in the neighborhood and own a real piece of property and put down roots just like the rest of us native Astorians have done for generations, not one that they will try and flip in a few years and not take pride in.<br /><br />Is that too much to ask? Or does everyone want to be covered in concrete here? If you do, I suggest you find another place to live, because the majority of Astoria IS one and two and three family homes with gardens and backyards, and that&#039;s the way the majority of it will stay, sorry to inform you. We do have building codes in place here and downsizing to stop this runaway scourge of overdevelopment is just around the corner.

				Since you are new to posting to this website let me first say hello and welcome from another native Astorian.<br /><br />There are several threads on Astorians discussing the Pistilli properties, especially Riverview East, going back at least a year or more and everything that can be said has pretty much been said, some have been pro, but most con including some comments I&#039;ve made. <br /><br />But the building is finished and its time to let it go. It is one thing to criticize the developer, but now that people have bought and are moving in the parameters of the discussion have changed. Would you like to be critiqued on the way your house looks? If not, let&#039;s cut the new owners some slack and move on.<br /><br />It&#039;s imperative Riverview succeed because I do not want to see 186 new homes stand empty on my doorstep. It&#039;s much better for everyone: Astoria, the surrounding property owners, the new Riverview East owners -- everyone -- if all of the apts. are sold because I believe new owners will care more about the neighborhood than Pistilli, who will rent the apartments if they are not sold -- and quite frankly I don&#039;t trust their record.<br /><br />You say you&#039;re a life-long Astorian. You don&#039;t say how old you are so maybe your frame of reference is shorter than mine but there are many changes overtaking the neighborhood, most good, but some no so good and contrary to your opinion Astoria is not solely made up of 1- 2- and 3- family houses. The housing stock is very diverse with many small apartment buildings and some large included in the mix -- that&#039;s what make Astoria so special -- at least to me. <br /><br />I&#039;ll leave the rest of your post without comment other than to say. You&#039;re not the only person who cares about Astoria and whose family has lived here for generations and believe it or not&nbsp; many newcomers also care -- more so than many people who rah! rah! and wave the Astoria flag.<br /><br />
