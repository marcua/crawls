				There was a fire in the apartment building behind mine last night and I was wondering if anyone had any info on it.&nbsp; I called 911, but they already had received several calls and the fire department was there very quickly.&nbsp; I hope everyone was all right - based on people talking outside, it sounded like everyone was fine...<br /><br />First time I&#39;ve ever had to call 911, though.&nbsp; Frightening, to see smoke pouring out of a building so very close to your own.

				This is the first I heard about it. I know the feeling though. It&#39;s disturbing to have something burn close to your apartment. Last year I woke up to smoke filling the room and found out it was an apartment/restaurant down the block that was on fire.<br /><br />Welcome to the board by the way :)

				Yes, I live on 30th ave and could see the whole thing from my bedroom window. Just thinking of the sound of the woman&#39;s voice while she was screaming her lungs off on the fire escape before escaping is enough to send a chill down my spine. It was also very surreal to watch the firemen busting windows and working to contain the fire just a couple dozen meters away from me. Getting to sleep after it was under control was no simple task either with my mind running wild about the possibility of a fire in my own apartment.
