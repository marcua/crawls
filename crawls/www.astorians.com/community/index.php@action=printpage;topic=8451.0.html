				What I don&#039;t get is that these guys ticket constantly for alternate side parking, yet the streets never seem to get cleaned. Yes, I&#039;m biased as a car owner on Ditmars, but I would like to know I get tickets for a reason. If I have to get up in the morning to move my car, I want to see some damn clean streets. <br /><br />Maybe they should focus more on ticketing litterers, because I wouldn&#039;t mind that. I saw a guy just tear up a receipt and throw it on the ground the other day and looked at him and looked at the trash can. He looked back at me like I had 3 heads. That&#039;s the kind of mentality that will make the trash situation worse. <br />I say they divert their focus from being parking Nazis to being Litterbug ticketers. I think most people would be OK with that idea. I have seen more meter maids in my neighborhood than regular cops, maybe they should so something useful instead of bothering regular old citizens who sometimes are way too hungover to get up on time to move their car :-D<br /><br />&lt;/rant&gt;. <br />

				I mentioned this in the other alternate side 4 days a week thing thread. I&#039;ve lived in my building for 24 years and I can&#039;t recall EVER seeing a street cleaner on my block. Occasionally on the way to the Subway I will see a street cleaner around 35th/33rd st going to the hydrant. He wasn&#039;t cleaning anything, just driving to the hydrant and filling up.

				Revenue is the name of the game with the traffic police.&nbsp; They are ready to pounce at 8:31 if alternate side starts at 8:30.&nbsp; The cleaners don&#039;t come for maybe a half-hour later and often don&#039;t do a good job with the cleaning. On days there is bad weather, the cleaners stay away, but the enforcement is ready to be done.&nbsp; Our satisfaction with the street&#039;s condition is not at the top of the list of concerns.

My proposal was to shift the focus of that revenue from ticketing people who don&#039;t move their cars for street cleaning (that evidently never happens) to ticketing people who actually make the garbage. I think that not only would it be an effective way to clean up the area, but also an equally profitable source of revenue. <br /><br />Not to say that they should stop ticketing cars altogether, but I maybe they wouldn&#039;t be ticketing at 8:30:01...<br />*PS As an aside, the benefit of that is that any ticket that I have contested that has been within 3 minutes of the cleaning time, I have won by simply telling them that the meter maid time was wrong. I think they give you the benefit of the doubt.&nbsp;

				I&#039;m sure it is already a punishable offense to litter on the city streets.&nbsp; I would be a little leery of having traffic or regular police more focused on stopping individuals based on littering. <br /><br />First, it would be arbitrary and not overarching. For the one person they stop, 10 will get away with it. It would not significantly decrease litter unless you had a minimum of 10 or 20 enforcement agents on the avenue.<br /><br />Secondly, I&#039;m not sure it would be implemented in a way where there would not be profiling of some kind involved.&nbsp; <br /><br />It might be more effective to find funding for the large shopping areas of the city to have increased staff to sweep individually throughout the day. Would not be a source of revenue to the city, but if quality of life is the real goal then it would be more effective than relying on the sweeping truck to do all of it once a day.

				How about coordinating Garbage Pickup with ALT side? Some of the blocks in my area are too narrow for a GT <strong><em>AND</em></strong> traffic to pass if cars are parked on both sides. Equip the GT&#039;s with a sweeping attachment, and as the slowly creep up the street on the car free side they clean the street AND leave room for traffic to pass. The only issue is knowing which day your side has garbage day.

				I just posted this elsewhere - regarding trash.&nbsp; This morning, I noticed how clean and free of debris Ditmars was.&nbsp; It was about 9am.&nbsp; I thought to myself, gee, it looks so clean!!&nbsp; As I got closer to the train, I encountered a street cleaner moving along a big garbage can and a broom.&nbsp; His jacket read Astoria Restoration, sponsored by Peter Vallone Jr.&nbsp; The street was clean where he had just been, and dirty where he was going.&nbsp; He was really cleaning the sidewalks.&nbsp; Perhaps if more people went to work at 9am instead of 7am, they would actually see this happening and would be less inclined to complain about the litter.&nbsp; It does actually get picked up!&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen this guy before but never paid attention.&nbsp; But with all recent bashing, he should be recognized.&nbsp; Thank you!!<br /><br />Thank you as well, Mr. Vallone.&nbsp; I do appreciate it!!<br /><br />Regardless, I would be in favor of ticketing litterbugs.

				I would also love to see people who litter get ticketed.&nbsp; It&#039;s great that there&#039;s someone to come in the morning and clean up, but that doesn&#039;t address the source of the problem - the people who just dump their trash wherever they feel like.&nbsp; When I see the streets full of food wrappers, newspapers, bags, lotto tickets, drink bottles and cans, I always wonder who are these people that just dump this stuff on the ground without a second thought and where do they come from?<br /><br />We already have a sign on 23rd Ave now that says &quot;Don&#039;t Honk $350 penalty&quot;.&nbsp; I&#039;d love to see ones that say &quot;Don&#039;t Litter $350 Penalty&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />

I think part of the problem is the existing litter, but part of it is also the way that people perceive the neighborhood. If Astoria is a viewed as a place with litter, people don&#039;t feel bad being the cause of more.<br /><br />I know that I&#039;m guilty of having set bottles or cans on the ground next to garbage cans (I always hope someone will recycle them instead of putting them in the cans). And I know I flick my cigarette butts around. It&#039;s bad and I shouldn&#039;t do it, but I justify it by saying &quot;Oh, hell, the cleaners will come, it&#039;s in the gutter. Whatever.&quot; Not that that makes it okay, but these are the kinds of things people think.<br /><br />Also, I would never ever ever even accidentally leave something behind out in the woods or around my small town (I put cigarette butts in my pocket there), but surrounded by concrete, I don&#039;t think I pay as much attention to it.

				I think the problem is that the politicians only send someone to clean once per day, while anyone with a brain knows that doesn&#039;t solve the problem, plus there are plenty of streets being ignored by clean up crews. Maybe if politicians (especially Vallone) didn&#039;t do a no-effort job dealing with the problem of dirty streets then maybe the streets would be cleaner at other times during the day. Vallone needs to concentrate on putting all effort into fixing the problems of Astoria instead of putting in little effort&nbsp; while running for Queens Borough President.

				The people who clean aren&#039;t really sent out by any of the local elected officials, though many of them (especially Vallone) help fund additional staff to increase the number of people cleaning the streets.&nbsp; The problem lies with the Department of Sanitation and we need to find a way to get DOS to send more people to sweep up in Astoria.&nbsp; Other groups that help sweep up include Astoria Restoration and the LDC as well as the BID.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s a question of getting more resources allocated to our community as well as improving enforcement.<br /><br />The new litter baskets that Councilmember Vallone has purchased for the community have made a big improvement along Broadway, but it&#039;s making sure folks put the trash in the cans and not just throw it on the ground, and then making sure someone sweeps it up if they do.&nbsp; I hope this issue gets raised in the meeting with the local elected officials.

				I&#039;ve seen the trash cans being replaced in my area..... One night a few blocks from me I saw some people switching trash cans we already had with trash cans that happen to have Vallone&#039;s name on it. I am very skeptical about how switching preexisting trash cans with ones with your name on it actually helps deal with the trash problem in Astoria. The money being spent on these &quot;new&quot; Vallone trash cans is money that can be better spent on more cleaning crews and such.

				Are they better trash cans, or just the same with his name? We have some useless chain-link trash cans on Ditmars, but then there&#039;s the green one with Vallone&#039;s name on it that seems a lot better. So if they&#039;re better I don&#039;t care if his name is on it. The fact that he wants his name on a trash can is kind of funny to me anyway.

				Whoa, I just noticed that Ditmars has acquired some fancy new Vallone-brand trash cans on the four corners east of Top Tomato. Those always had the chain link cans. Apparently someone&#039;s paying attention to our trash woes.. now let&#039;s see if people actually use them.

				Kudos for these new cans to Councilman Vallone. I&#039;m glad to hear that they are now part of the cleanup arsenal for our community.&nbsp; That said, we need more than a few fancy cans from an elected, which are more style than substance.&nbsp; An earlier post is right, we need to pin down the department of sanitation and ask them why we need to BEG to keep our streets clean. Our mayor keeps talking quality of life, but litter keeps getting worse in Astoria. The streets in Manhattan don&#039;t look this way.&nbsp; <br /><br />When the DOS gets cracking, I&#039;ll be more inclined to cheer for any of our electeds, especially those who sponsor fancy cans.&nbsp; Hopefully the meeting will bear fruit on this issue.

				I think in addition to the above, a massive reeducation campaign of respect for our neighborhood is in order for all those who think it&#039;s ok to throw trash on the ground - any kind of trash, from newspapers, flyers, bags to the tiny cigarette butt.&nbsp; If people think it&#039;s ok just because &quot;everyone else is doing it, and that&#039;s what the sanitation jobs are for&quot;, it only becomes a vicious cycle of dirty streets.&nbsp; Which unfortunately is the state of Astoria right now, and the sanitation guy can only do so much on his one little shift before people just make it dirty again.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it seems very little people have respect for their neighborhood&nbsp; and environment.&nbsp; I&#039;m known to carry trash until I see a trash can.&nbsp; London is one of the cleanest cities around and they hardly have any trash cans.&nbsp; Why not here?&nbsp; It&#039;s sad really.<br /><br />Does the department of sanitation clean the streets every hour on the hour in Manhattan?&nbsp; I&#039;m curious about the frequency of cleaning there.

				The newer cans that have Vallone&#039;s name on them are bigger than the older cans, at least they were at the intersection where I live.<br />I think Gleason and Daisy are right - we need them to really bring back, and push home, the &quot;Do Not Litter&quot; campaign.&nbsp; I think a few tickets for folks caught throwing trash on the ground would also send the right message.
