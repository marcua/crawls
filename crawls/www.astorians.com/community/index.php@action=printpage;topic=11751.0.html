It was one hell of a fierce crashing, smashing, derby fiesta! Manhattan 2 time game MVP, Em Dash, scored a whopping 52 of Mayhem&#039;s 79 points. Bronx captain Kandy Kakes took home the MVP title for her team after spending the night picking off anything in orange she could see.<br /><br />The season continues Saturday, 8/16 when the Bronx Gridlock cabbies battle the Queens of Pain at Hunter College Sportsplex at Lexington Avenue and 68th Street in Manhattan.<br /><br />Last year, the Gridlock stole the championship trophy away from the &#039;Pain (95-90) in a total nailbiting season finale, and both teams go into this much awaited re-match undefeated for the 2008 season.

				I hope this doesn&#039;t count as an illegal bump--we strive to be law-abiding rollergirls online!<br /><br />But we are in desperate need of volunteers to help us set up on Saturday! In exchange for showing up at the venue (Hunter College Sportsplex, 68th and Lex) early at 3 p.m. and helping us load in our floor and various other derby acoutrements, you get a <em><strong>FREE</strong></em> ticket to watch the bout *PLUS* the gratitude of 50 adoring rollergirls. After the bout, you help us tear up the floor and load everything back into the truck, and then you&#039;re on your way, hopefully to our rockin&#039; afterparty at Manitoba&#039;s. The more volunteers we get, the easier the entire job will be. You&#039;ll definitely have time to go grab some food and possibly a beer before the game, and afterwards you&#039;ll still have plenty of time to party with us!<br /><br />So, interested in getting behind the scenes with the Gotham Girls? Then email Brigitte Barhot at brigittebarhot@gothamgirlsrollerderby.com ASAP and let her know that you will be there!<br /><br />Thanks, and see you on Saturday!

				Well, considering that there are several of the Bronx Gridlock players who are Astoria residents (compared to only one or two for Queens), a Gridlock victory is a victory for Astoria!&nbsp; :mrgreen:
