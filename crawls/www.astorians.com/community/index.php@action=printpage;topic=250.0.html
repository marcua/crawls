				clipped from www.notonedamndime.com<br /><br /><br />&quot;NOT ONE DAMN DIME DAY <br /><br />Since our leaders don't have the moral courage to speak out against the war in Iraq, Inauguration Day, Thursday, January 20th, 2005 is &quot;Not One Damn Dime Day&quot; in America. <br /><br />On &quot;Not One Damn Dime Day&quot; those who oppose what is happening in our name in Iraq can speak up with a 24-hour national boycott of all forms of consumer spending. <br /><br />During &quot;Not One Damn Dime Day&quot; please don't spend money, and don't use your credit card. Not one damn dime for gasoline. Not one damn dime for necessities or for impulse purchases. Nor toll/cab/bus or train ride money exchanges. Not one damn dime for anything for 24 hours. <br /><br />On &quot;Not One Damn Dime Day,&quot; please boycott Walmart, KMart and Target. Please don't go to the mall or the local convenience store. Please don't buy any fast food (or any groceries at all for that matter). <br /><br />For 24 hours, please do what you can to shut the retail economy down. The object is simple. Remind the people in power that the war in Iraq is immoral and illegal; that they are responsible for starting it and that it is their responsibility to stop it. <br /><br />&quot;Not One Damn Dime Day&quot; is to remind them, too, that they work for the people of the United States of America, not for the international corporations and K Street lobbyists who represent the corporations and funnel cash into American politics. <br /><br />&quot;Not One Damn Dime Day&quot; is about supporting the troops. The politicians put the troops in harm's way. Now 1,200 brave young Americans and (some estimate) 100,000 Iraqis have died. The politicians owe our troops a plan -- a way to come home. <br /><br />There's no rally to attend. No marching to do. No left or right wing agenda to rant about. On &quot;Not One Damn Dime Day&quot; you take action by doing nothing. You open your mouth by keeping your wallet closed. <br /><br />For 24 hours, nothing gets spent, not one damn dime, to remind our religious leaders and our politicians of their moral responsibility to end the war in Iraq and give America back to the people. <br /><br /><br />Please share this as an email with as many people as possible, and please express your opinion at www.NotOneDamnDime.com . &quot;
