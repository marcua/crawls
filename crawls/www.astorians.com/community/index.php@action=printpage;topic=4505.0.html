				Is this a subtle way of reminding us that spring and summer actually on the way, in spite of the fact that it is really not even winter yet?

				Didn&#39;t winter start on Dec 21st? I read a weather report that El Nino is to blame for the mild weather we&#39;ve been having.&nbsp; So bring back the street fairs now?&nbsp; I can&#39;t wait til April :(

				Reminder -- the street fair on 30th Avenue is going on today until 6pm (I think). Same usual stuff, but the block between 32nd and 33rd Street has Brazilian vendors and the bandshell in front of Key Food looks like it will be featuring Brazilian music (based upon the sign on it).
