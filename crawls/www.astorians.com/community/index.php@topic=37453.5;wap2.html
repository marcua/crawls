			Thanks 28Grand. <br /><br />There are pages of spam posts left in the Business Listings area.

			If you have spam lasting longer than 4 hours...<br /><br /><br />We still have spam.

			<strong>LaoWombat</strong>:

			I thought that some of the regulars must have had their accounts hijacked because the posters were listed as senator, mayor etc.&nbsp; Then I realized that the flood of posts just automatically elevated them to that level.&nbsp; <br /><br />It certainly seems as though the mods have at least temporarily lost control.&nbsp; On some forums newbies are moderated until they demonstrate that they are not bots, but I don&#039;t know if that is feasible here.<br /><br />Perhaps if the forum were nuked from orbit...&lt;grin&gt;

			Had to remove astorians.com from my RSS feed of Astoria/LIC sites. It was completely drowned in spam.&nbsp; :lipsrsealed:
