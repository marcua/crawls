				This is great news - that space has been empty for years. However, I saw a sign that a bank was coming in - some bank I&#039;ve never heard of. Maybe both the bank and Starbucks will be opening up. Even if you don&#039;t like Starbucks (and I&#039;m not a fan), having it there will be a boost to Broadway in general.

				Not sure when it&#039;s going to open, but I imagine it shouldn&#039;t take too long.&nbsp; I agree that it should improve business on Broadway considering it seems like every other week someone is going out of business.

				I&#039;m not sure how it will &quot;improve business&quot; on Broadway.&nbsp; It&#039;s a boon for Starbucks fans, but will do little to help the other places that are going out of business.&nbsp; All around the city commercial rents are at the point where more and more only big chains can afford to pay them.

				A friend reports the usually spotted bank/bucks combo out in California was with Wells Fargo Bank.&nbsp; Kinda like the urge to visit your money and drink some Joe at the same time.&nbsp; There&#039;s a new combo at the Daily News bldg in Manhattan, but I dunno which monument to money is the cohabitant.

				The bank looks like it is going to take up a lot of space, plus it&#039;s built right next to an existing bank.&nbsp; &nbsp;I guess Starbucks squeezes in somewhere.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t like their coffee, but they are nice places, clean, and clientele is always nice. Hope bums of broadway don&#039;t try and make it hangout.

				So Marathon Bank is at the 31st St -B&#039;way intersection, this Quontic thing with the Starbucks and the gym, then Capital One.&nbsp; That makes 3 banks on one block.&nbsp; Dear dog, these must be the only storefronts in that stretch large enough to mangle money.

				Went to the new Starbucks today, and it is really nice inside...they did a great job with it. Very spacious, tons of tables and a bar with stools to sit at. I know a lot of people don&#039;t like Starbucks, but its a welcome addition to that area to me, and a place where you can grab a coffee and / or get some work done or just hang out a bit.
