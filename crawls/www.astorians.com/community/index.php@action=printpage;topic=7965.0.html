Moderated by Chris Matthews.<br />Monday, September 24, 7:30 p.m. <br />At The Times Center<br /><br />The Museum’s popular and innovative online exhibition The Living Room Candidate: Presidential Campaign Commercials 1952-2004 shows the critical role that TV ads play in presidential politics. They define the major issues of a campaign, and, perhaps more importantly, they evoke strong emotional responses for (and against) individual candidates. This special program brings together some of the key creative figures in recent and current presidential campaigns to offer an inside view of the art and craft of political advertising. Special guest moderator Chris Matthews is the host of Hardball with Chris Matthews on MSNBC, and of The Chris Matthews Show, a syndicated news program produced by NBC News. Mark McKinnon ran the media campaigns for George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004 and is currently working on John McCain’s campaign; Marius Penczner is an independent filmmaker and photographer who is John Edwards’s 2008 media consultant; Drew Westen is the author of the acclaimed new book The Political Brain: The Role of Emotion in Deciding the Fate of the Nation. <br /><br />At The Times Center, 242 W. 41st Street, Manhattan. $12 Museum members/$25 nonmembers/ free for Sponsor level and above. <br />Buy online or call 718 . 784.4520.

				Thanks for the heads up!&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen the exhibit at the museum, and I&#039;m very glad it&#039;s there and on the Net.&nbsp; <br /><br />The single thing that I appreciate most is the &quot;Rats-Bureaucrats&quot; ad of 2000.&nbsp; Some reporters said the shorter word may have flashed for a moment, but they were just being cautious.&nbsp; The four-letter word was on the screen for easily a full second, if not longer.&nbsp; Bush was right, in a way, in saying there was nothing &quot;subliminable.&quot;&nbsp; That &quot;RATS&quot; was not a hint but a direct statement.

				McD and all,<br />Last night&#039;s event was more interesting than I expected. But left me wanting more.<br />I may have more to write about the presentation for another post.<br /><br /><br /><br />One participant was very striking. (One panel member said he is glad Drew writes books rather than advise competition):<br />***<br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Westen<br /><br />As Dr. Westen said, &quot;None of the circuits involved in conscious reasoning were particularly engaged... Essentially, it appears as if partisans twirl the cognitive kaleidoscope until they get the conclusions they want... Everyone... may reason to emotionally biased judgments when they have a vested interest in how to interpret &#039;the facts.&#039;&quot;<br /><br />http://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/publicaffairsbooks-cgi-bin/display?book=1586484257<br /><span class="bbc_u">The Political Brain</span> is a groundbreaking investigation into the role of emotion in determining the political life of the nation.<br />

				&quot;&quot;<br />A Note from DREW WESTEN<br /><br /><br />In the last forty-five years, the American people have elected only three Democratic presidents of the United States. Democrats—from the grassroots on up to the party leadership—are befuddled, confused, and angry. What led me to write this book was exactly what leads people to do everything they do, including vote: strong emotions. And that&#039;s the central message of the book. Everything we know about mind, brain, and politics tells us that there are three things that determine how people vote, in this order: their feelings toward the parties, their feelings toward the candidates, and, if they haven&#039;t decided by then, their feelings toward the candidates&#039; policy positions. Democrats have insisted on starting at the bottom of this hierarchy, practicing &quot;trickle up&quot; politics—the theory that voting decisions trickle up from voters&#039; rational assessments of candidates&#039; policy positions. Trickle up politics turns out to be as valid as trickle down economics. The proof is in the White House, the Congress, and the federal judiciary. The antidote lies not in familiar prescriptions of moving to the center or the left but simply in moving the electorate. The way to win elections, particularly against a party that understands how to move people, is to understand the political brain—how it evolved, how it works, and how central emotion is to it. <br /><br />.
