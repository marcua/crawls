				I am in the market to rent OR buy...depending.<br /><br />I love Astoria, but the architecture is lacking.&nbsp; It&#39;s a primary reason why the nabe isn&#39;t as highly touted as some in B&#39;klyn (which I&#39;m happy about).<br /><br />I am intent on moving into a great looking apt in a great looking bldg.&nbsp; After spending a lot of time looking at places, I&#39;m pretty fed up with the inferior, antiquated quality that seems to dominate the Astoria housing market.<br /><br />SO - anyone got any hot tips on buildings?&nbsp; I&#39;ve been to a bunch of open houses and consulted a bunch of realtors but am awfully frustrated.&nbsp; I&#39;m trying to plant roots here but am finding precious little fertile ground.<br /><br />Please don&#39;t take this as an attack on Astoria - it is what it is.&nbsp; I&#39;m just trying to find the gems.

				I live in a pretty nice prewar building.&nbsp; I know there&#39;s a one-bedroom for sale, and it was posted on Craig&#39;s List under the heading &quot;Huge One Bedroom in Long Island City/Astoria for $390,000&quot;.&nbsp; It&#39;s way way overpriced, and I&#39;m sure the current owners are trying to recoup their investment because they&#39;ve only been there a short time, but trust me comps won&#39;t support it and it would be worth bargaining them down.

				Good luck MR. Welcome.<br /><br />But it sounds like all may end well if you find a home in Brooklyn.&nbsp; :wink:<br />Absolutely right, lots of gems there.<br /><br />Hmmm,<br />Maybe we should have welcome baskets for new residents of Brooklyn.

				I love Astoria, but I can appreciate the comments about its architecture.&nbsp; Best area I know of outside Brooklyn is 44th Drive on the other side of the bridge.&nbsp; Super charming, staid string of well proportioned brownstones, you&#39;d think you&#39;re in the north slope.<br /><br />The home pricing there is high, but I dont think it has topped out, so they might not be a bad investment.<br /><br />One of the most architectually pleasant areas, if not the most sophisiticated, was 36th Street just south of 30th Avenue.&nbsp; For three quarters of a block such pretty well balanced housing, with even sightlines, front gardens.&nbsp; Unfortunately, a developer built out to the maximum a couople of years ago, and now its only a matter of time before the eyesores remove any sense of charm the house might have had.&nbsp; Same will happen to Ditmars between Crescent and 29th Streets.<br />&nbsp;<br />On the west side of 21st street, just south of Astoria Park, has some scattered gems.&nbsp;

				but whats available to buy there? probably not much. don&#39;t see for sale signs too often on 35th or 36th.<br /><br />the housing design in queens as a whole is really dissapointing. there is this new building on 23rd ave and 38th street and for some reason they thought to make the facade of the whoel first floor brown marble...<br />we thought maybe some nightclub was coming (ugh) but i saw a for rent sign the other day... and they are looking to fill it with medical offices. yikes. <br />so ugly.

				I love the house with the vines all over the front, and the one with the arbor in the front yard.&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />We walked by there the other day, and it looked like they&#39;d renovated the inside of one of those houses with out tearing down the outside of the structure, which I&#39;m not necessarily opposed to.&nbsp; I&#39;m interested to see how that will turn out.

				I love the houses lining Ditmars between 27th and 25th....they are three stories, and most of the older ones are getting fixed up...I love that area and love the homes, so pretty, tree-lined, and I don&#39;t have an actually date, but was speaking to a woman who owned one and said it has been in her family for over 80 years.

				The facade isn&#39;t bad looking, but the sides of the building are yucky-looking.&nbsp; Like it&#39;s a building designed to be connected to other buildings so no one would see the sides.
