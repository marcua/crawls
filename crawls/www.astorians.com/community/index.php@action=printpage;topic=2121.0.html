				Hi everyone,<br /><br />I just found the Hellgate CSA website, and I&#39;m super-psyched!&nbsp; I&#39;m torn between sharing a share, or being a veggie hog and eating it all.&nbsp; $10 sounds very reasonable, and in my mind, I *think* I can eat $10 worth of veggies in a week.&nbsp; I belonged to another CSA last year, sharing with another person, and we regretfully had to chuck out a lot of the veggies because we didn&#39;t have the time to go through it all and they rotted.&nbsp; It cost a little more to join, but the bounty was overwhelming.<br /><br />Here&#39;s how I assess it: would my fridge be bulging at the seams with one share?&nbsp; Has anyone had experience in tackling a share by themselves?<br /><br />Another question, regarding canning: I would love to can tomatoes this year, but I don&#39;t know how.&nbsp; I was itching to do it last year, but I was really intimidated by the whole equipment and process whatnot.&nbsp; Does anyone in the CSA can?&nbsp; If a kind soul has the time, could there be a workshop or worksheet about how to get started with canning?<br /><br />&nbsp;:?<br /><br />~chicken<br /><br />

				I don&#39;t can yet but I&#39;m committed to figuring it out.&nbsp; Going to start by trying to make some strawberry jam!<br /><br />I&#39;ll definitely be hosting a canning party or two once I get the hang of it.&nbsp; I&#39;m also down with loaning out the equipment.<br /><br />cheers,<br />jayme<br />

				That canner looks great! I want one. But $80 sounds like a lot. I&#39;m going to shop around a bit and compare a bit.<br /><br />I&#39;m guessing that you put jars of food in the pressure cooker cold, and then you lock it and turn on the lid? Then with the next batch you start cold again?

				I&#39;m not entirely certain.<br /><br />My mom always just used a stock pot and a canning rack (wire insert that holds jars upright/in line).<br /><br />I&#39;ve just read through a canning guide from Just Food -- I&#39;ll post info here.<br /><br />Ebay also looks like it&#39;s got some good options but it I go pressure cooker, I think I&#39;ll get a newer one.&nbsp; Ancient possibly explosive cooking device is scary.<br /><br /><br />cheers,<br />jayme

				I used to use a pressure cooker all the time (you can go from dried beans to fully cooked in like 45 minutes to an hour in a pc), and found it much less scary than I originally anticipated.<br /><br />I also have a 16 qt. stockpot to share if that would be useful.

				Jonathan --<br /><br />Still researching and I haven&#39;t consulted any &quot;real&quot; cookbooks yet -- just the internet.<br /><br />Food safety wise, meats and low acidity vegetables need to be pressure cooked.&nbsp; Fruits and high acid veggies (or acid added veggie mixes) can be canned in boiling water.<br /><br />I haven&#39;t yet hit the motherload on pressure cooked canning.<br /><br />I think I may try a round of jam and strawberries (whole fruit) in June -- boiling water canning -- and then decide then about pressure cooking.&nbsp; I don&#39;t expect to can meats and I don&#39;t have a TON of storage space so I think my canning needs to, realistically, be contained to what I can find space for in my kitchen in terms of equipment (pressure cookers, stock pots, etc) and in my cabinets (jams!&nbsp; tomato products of all sorts!).<br /><br />So first tentative, come on over an can, July 4th weekend.&nbsp; My place?&nbsp; <br /><br />As a bonus, I&#39;ll be just back from Italy then and will be pouring limoncello.<br /><br />I feel like I can accomodate around 5.&nbsp; Very casual.&nbsp; We&#39;ll do a batch or two of something collectively and after the seals set (the next day), everybody can take a jar.<br /><br />If it&#39;s berries, everybody brings some (organic, please!&nbsp; local, lovely!) and a few good ideas.<br /><br />cheers,<br />jayme

				Thank you for the invite but we will be out of town that weekend.&nbsp; I am curious about your research, so please keep us in the loup.<br /><br />As for limoncello, the recipe is simple.&nbsp; We should make a batch.

				<strong>Limoncello? Canning party?</strong><br />Perfect combo. Let the canning begin!! (Eric and I got a late season tomato share so although we&#39;re ready for the July 4th session, another later this fall would be great since we have no idea what we&#39;re doing)

				I agree - another canning session later in the fall would be super because of the tomatoes.

				Yep.&nbsp; The July 4th session is my early attempt to figure out how this all works before I have 20lbs of tomato sitting around&nbsp; :|<br /><br />Also, perfect strawberry jam in winter mmmmmm -- not a bad idea either.
