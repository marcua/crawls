				Anyone want to meet up tonight and play some pool at McCann&#039;s or some bar on Broadway? <br /><br />Not looking for a date or anything of the sort, so boys are invited too. Just someone (or some people) who enjoy playing pool and want to hang out, drink and play pool on a Tuesday night.<br /><br />Hope to see you soon!<br />Mike

				Haven&#039;t been to any places nearer to LIC than the Broadway stop (I live off the Astoria Blvd stop), but I&#039;m game for any place along the N/W line that&#039;s easy to find and has pool tables. Can you recommend any?<br /><br />And I always welcome a challenge or just a fun game, regardless of the other persons sex.

				Yeah, I&#039;ve been by breaks several times. For whatever reason I prefer bars that have pool tables as opposed to pool places that have bars. I&#039;ve never been inside breaks to give it a chance so who knows - I may like it.<br /><br />I will probably hit McCann&#039;s tonight though if noone pipes in and says they want to meet up somewhere else. Or maybe hit up Doyle&#039;s and let Brendan or Barry (or whoever the bartender happens to be on a Tuesday night) beat me up in pool.

				Don&#039;t know if I can make it tonight but would be up for a game another time.&nbsp; Although, I am absolutely horrible at pool.
