				I thought that it was really great-- not a lot of people came out for it.<br /><br />Peter Vallone did not want to debate or do a back and forth.&nbsp; His reasoning was that there is a debate October 19th or something at Ricardo&#039;s.&nbsp; He spoke first-- talked about his dealings as the &quot;advocate&quot; for Astoria: worked to stop some of the power plants, worked for decreased pollution, cleaned up graffiti, etc.&nbsp; Explained that he did not want to extend term limits, but felt that he had no choice but to vote for it.&nbsp; He talked about how he is a product of Astoria schools, that his daughters went to public schools in Astoria when they were younger and then attended Catholic school for high school.&nbsp; Vallone then left, but two members of his staff stayed.&nbsp; <br /><br />Lynne Serpe talked about her work with a non-profit that helps green businesses, and how she wants to work with more businesses in Astoria etc to help green them, that she feels that Vallone did not do enough to stop power plants, that she would like to work with schools to help make them more green (food and structurally), and that she was against extending term limits and explained that Peter Vallone could have voted &quot;no&quot; but didn&#039;t.&nbsp; She spoke about the community garden in Astoria, the need for access to fresh food for all people here, the need for affordable housing, the fact that there is money for organizations to become more green due to the lawsuit against con-ed after the black-out.&nbsp; Lynne also talked briefly about her previous work in politics.<br /><br />Jerry Kahn explained that he has run against Peter Vallone before, and one time was able to get 20% of the vote with very little campaign money, so that there seems to be dissatisfaction in Astoria about it&#039;s representation in city hall.&nbsp; He talked about affecting change as a group, rather than waiting for things to just happen to us (which I gathered to be his motivation for running) and about taxing the rich instead of hiking sales tax.&nbsp; When asked about the biggest problem in the school in Astoria, he talked about how most of the teachers that he spoke with said that they felt powerless to affect change within the schools.&nbsp; He talked about getting parents more involved and that they should have more power in schools to make changes.&nbsp; <br /><br />
