				We live in exciting times and the march toward equality is moving forward.&nbsp; Five states currently grant gay and lesbian couples the right to marry.&nbsp; New York&nbsp; should be the sixth state - marriage equality passed the State Assembly and Governor Paterson has promised to sign the legislation into law.&nbsp; If the State Senate votes for marriage equality, New Yorkers of all sexual orientations will enjoy the right to marry.<br />&nbsp;<br />Today, two Astorians and I met with Senator George Onorato, the State Senator who represents us.&nbsp; Senator Onorato made it clear that he opposes marriage equality and that he plans to vote against it in the State Senate.&nbsp; He says that Astoria is a &quot;conservative district&quot; and that most Astorians agree with him that a marriage is between a man and a woman.&nbsp; <em>The Senator is standing on the wrong side of history, and he is doing it in our names.&nbsp; </em> I think the Senator is wrong about our community.&nbsp; <strong><span class="bbc_u">If you live in Astoria and you think marriage is a right that should be available to all, please call Senator Onorato&#039;s office at 518-455-348</span></strong>6 and let his staff know how you feel.<br />&nbsp;<br />One of the people meeting with Senator Onorato is a gay man - he told the Senator that he and his partner were denied over 1,000 rights that are available to heterosexual couples.&nbsp; I told the Senator that my own upcoming marriage is an interracial marriage.&nbsp; 43 years ago my fiancee and I would not be allowed to get married in America, and our relationship is better off because other people fought for justice (for more details, read this incredible statement in support of marriage equality from Mildred Loving, a black woman who was jailed for marrying a white man: http://lesbianlife.about.com/od/gaymarriageinformation/a/Loving.htm).&nbsp; Brian Beard explained to the Senator that a majority of Astorians actually do support marriage equality, as do most of New York&#039;s leading elected officials.&nbsp; The Senator was unmoved by our presentations, so I ask you to call Senator Onorato to stand up for the rights of us.&nbsp; If you have more time, go to Marriage Equality New York&#039;s web site and get involved (http://www.meny.us/) or write the Senator (http://www.jeremiahfp.org/downloads/OnoratoLetterPacket.doc)<br />&nbsp;<br />Thank you,<br />&nbsp;<br />Jeremiah<br />&nbsp;<br />P.S.&nbsp; If you haven&#039;t already, check out the Courage Campaign&#039;s video in support of marriage equality:&nbsp; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-awVQkTeVE<br /><br />P.P.S.&nbsp; I&#039;m not a pro with this message board, but think this is not just an Out Astoria topic.&nbsp; Can mods share it more generally?

				I agree with you that there are definitely differences between race and sexuality.&nbsp; But I think, when it comes to marriage, the similarities are compelling.&nbsp; I&#039;m straight and my fiancee is black; I&#039;m mindful that our relationship wouldn&#039;t be possible in much of America just 45 years ago, and I&#039;m mindful that our marriage is only possible because others stood up for civil rights.&nbsp; It&#039;s our generation&#039;s turn to stand up for the LBGT people&#039;s right to marry.<br /><br />Mildred Loving, the woman who went to jail for marrying a white man and who brought the court case that made interracial marriage legal throughout the U.S. said it best:<br /><br />&quot;Surrounded as I am now by wonderful children and grandchildren, not a day goes by that I don’t think of Richard and our love, our right to marry, and how much it meant to me to have that freedom to marry the person precious to me, even if others thought he was the &#039;wrong kind of person&#039; for me to marry. I believe all Americans, no matter their race, no matter their sex, no matter their sexual orientation, should have that same freedom to marry. Government has no business imposing some people’s religious beliefs over others. Especially if it denies people’s civil rights.&quot;<br /><br />http://www.positiveliberty.com/2007/06/mildred-lovings-statement.html

				He does not seem to realize that Astoria has changed a lot since he was first elected.&nbsp; I just hope we can educate him and get enough contacts to his office in support of marriage equality that he listens and changes this position.

Because the same people that would argue today that separate but equal civil union are okay, would have once argued that separate drinking fountains are equal. or separate eating areas are equal...on and on and on. <br /><br />It is not meant as a cheap shot. I still recall vividly the Colin Powell interview when he argued that discrimination based on skin color is different from discrimination based on sexual orientation. <br /><br />But I say that All discrimination is evil. When one declares a certain part of society less than you, one is the same as the KKK.

				Thank you JFP for this notice on marriage equality.<br /><br /><br />Is it known if this will go to a vote. And would you want it to go to a vote whether or not the elected officials vote yes or no?<br />Voters can then keep this vote in mind for the next election.<br /><br /><br />I think anyone who believes this is an important issue should contact Onorato.<br />It appears this issue is moving forward state after state and NY should not be left behind.<br />Elected officials should do their job and if the voters dont like it, they can then respond.<br /><br /><br />Learn about the issue if you are not familiar. It is a shame when a couple loses a spouse and does not have the same protections most would have because they were denied to marry.<br /><br /><br />I have seen some debate where over in CA whether the state should be in the business of marriage and discriminating who can marry.<br /><br /><br />

				I called, left a message. This is an election issue for me, if the Senator ends up voting against marriage equality I won&#039;t be able to vote for him in the future unfortunately because it will be clear he doesn&#039;t represent me. I encouraged him to vote in support. For anyone who looked on in disappointment as California narrowly passed Prop 8 I strongly encourage you to not allow history to repeat itself. It is your/our turn. Calling only takes 2 minutes.

That somehow their votes, tax dollars, and opinions carry more weight because of it.

				I would like to share with you this article the New York Times did on the success in Vermont: http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/08/us/08vermont.html<br /><br />On the second page of this article you can find this quote:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Representative Robert South, a freshman Democrat from a conservative district, said he reversed his position after 228 of his constituents reached out and urged him to support the override, compared with 198 who urged him to oppose it.<br /><br />“It was very difficult for me,” Mr. South said, “because the marriage equality bill, as far as I’m concerned, has split the state. I see how close my numbers are for and against same-sex marriage, and it’s divided my constituents, and that’s what upsets me.”</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The voice of the people mattered in Vermont. It will matter in New York.

				My family has lived in Astoria since the 20s and I was born here in the 60s. I don’t presume to speak for any other Astorian but I support the legislation and will contact Oronato. <br /><br />Not all life-long or longer-term Astorians are as conservative about this issue as some would have you think and many have gay family member and friends.<br /><br />And it wouldn’t hurt contacting Taminent Club regulars, including the Peter Vallone, Paul Vallone, Mike Gianaris and Gloria D’Amico to see if they have any influence with their esteemed colleague. Carolyn Maloney is always a special guest star at Taminent during election time, maybe she can pop over and have a word too.<br />

				I have yet to hear a truly compelling reason why I should be against marriage equality for gay and lesbian couples. It simply makes sense that they be allowed the same rights that are given to straight couples -- all men being created equal and all. This is one of a long list of steps that we as a nation need to take to assure that all of our citizens are treated with the respect and dignity that is afforded them by the Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution.<br /><br />I emailed Senator George Onorato and I have posted on Facebook, Twitter, &amp; Friendfeed encouraging other Astorians to do the same. I also agree with Merm and I expressed this position to the Senator -- his stance on this issue will most definitely affect how I vote.<br /><br />Now go rent Milk or check out the free Harvey Milk / Gay Rights documentary on Hulu ... :mrgreen:<br /><br />Hulu: The Times of Harvey Milk (http://www.hulu.com/watch/49577/the-times-of-harvey-milk)

				Thanks to all who have reached out on to the Senator and who are organizing to move us forward. &nbsp;With Senator Onorato, respectful phone calls and letters are more effective than emails. &nbsp;That said, this issue is urgent right now, so anything you can do to try to change his mind is much appreciated.<br /><br />I understand that this is a difficult issue for some people, but I think Maurice (and others) are exactly right: this is a civil rights issue and people should be free to marry whomever they love. &nbsp;Here&#039;s a great video by the Courage Campaign: &nbsp;<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-awVQkTeVE<br /><br />TRX - Here&#039;s hoping you can make an honest man out of him soon!

				Janet and Candyce up in Albany are amazing and great people.&nbsp; I had a good talk with Janet - I hope we can find a way to move the Senator.&nbsp; I think his &quot;Astoria is conservative&quot; argument is not a valid one - the Senator only got 48.1% of the vote in a three way race, with George Delis getting 29.2% and Ed Sedarbaum (an openly gay candidate) getting 22.7%.&nbsp; In the last decade, I would argue that Astoria has dramatically changed, with Onorato&#039;s base shrinking as older voters move or pass on and a large number of young couples, LGBT people and other ethnic groups move to the neighborhood.&nbsp; If he couldn&#039;t get a bare majority a decade ago, he probably can&#039;t get one today.&nbsp; (Keep in mind, they also redrew the district lines in 2002 to make the district more conservative - eliminating Bayside and adding Maspeth, though I still think all of the parts of Western Queens have been in transition for the last decade, and in a more progressive direction).

				I am wondering if some sort of larger showing might be in order.&nbsp; Besides calls to his office, which should continue until the phones ring off the hook, we might want to organize a rally or event in support of marriage equality right here in <strong>Astoria.</strong> The event wouldn&#039;t have to necessarily smack the senator, but the underlying theme will be there are hundreds of activated voters in this community that care about this issue.&nbsp; It&#039;s time to stand with the community or go the way of the dinosaur. <br /><br />There is also a online petition that JFP worked on that everyone in the senator&#039;s district should sign:&nbsp; http://www.petitiononline.com/love2/petition.html<br /><br />We need to keep the pressure on!

				[mod: Merged from a second thread.]<br /><br />Hi neighbors,<br /><br />Brandon here. Our state senator, George Onorato, is out of touch.<br /><br />He believes District 12 (Astoria, Sunnyside, Woodside and LIC) doesn&#039;t support gay marriage equality for New Yorkers.<br /><br />I think otherwise. There&#039;s currently a gay marriage bill proposed by Gov Paterson and Oronato has said he&#039;ll vote against this historic civil rights bill. <br /><br />The Democratic Party now controls the State Senate which allows for a gay marriage bill to be introduced onto the Senate floor for debate. While formerly in Republican party control, no marriage bill could have been introduced for debate.<br /><br />New York Governor David Paterson publicly supports gay marriage equality as does the House of Representatives and most of the Senate.<br /><br />However, the Senate is a few votes short of reaching the required number of supporters to pass the bill.<br /><br /><br />State Senator George Onorato, who represents western Queens county, is one of the senators who doesn&#039;t yet support gay marriage rights for his constituents. <br /><br />Astoria alone is one of the most gay-friendly neighborhoods in all of New York City.

				OK, here we go again. If one doesn&#039;t&nbsp; support&nbsp; Gay &#039;marriage&#039; they are like the KKK/illiterate and if one supports&nbsp; it proves&nbsp; they are &#039;enlightened.&#039; Of course neither is&nbsp; true. The truth is&nbsp; many folks for&nbsp; socio-religious&nbsp; reasons have a legitimate argument for not calling two same sex folks&nbsp; wanting a&nbsp; union, marriage. On the other&nbsp; hand, we live in a&nbsp; free society, at least until the &#039;PC&#039; police&nbsp; take over :lol:&nbsp; and have to have equal accommodation under the law. If two adults&nbsp; want to have a&nbsp; civil union, with all the strengths and laws&nbsp; of those who are married, fine, call it a civil union, since&nbsp; it&#039;s not a marriage. This is IF people&#039;s goal is to be together and respect&nbsp; other people&#039;s traditions. Unfortunately, what I see in such debates, is that the goal is to&nbsp; force&nbsp; people to accept&nbsp; their&nbsp; view&nbsp; of life as&nbsp; THE&nbsp; view and penalties, like what was happening with that pageant&nbsp; contestant. In the end, personally, I won&#039;t call to support OR&nbsp; oppose&nbsp; it being called&nbsp; marriage. I understand and respect&nbsp; both sides&nbsp; of the argument.&nbsp;

				While Senator Onorato has now declared his opposition to the marriage equality bill, I think those of us who support the bill need to keep in touch with him and his staff, on a regular basis, respectfully making our points.&nbsp; We need to convince him that he has come to the wrong conclusions.&nbsp; I do worry that the issue could get heated, especially with many people feeling quite passionately about the issue, but civil discourse and even polite demonstrations are more likely to make the point than more provocative actions, which I contend could be counter-productive.&nbsp; Letters, calls, petitions, meetings, these are all tried-and-true methods to move elected officials on an issue and should be done.&nbsp; Other tactics, including berating staff members and being less pleasant are less likely to see good results.

If you are interested in lending your talents or your time please send me private message (http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?action=unread) or email (merm@astorians.com) expressing your interest.<br /><br />At a minimum it would be great if you could donate an hour or two of your time once or twice over the next few weeks contributing in some way.

				An interesting part of this discussion is the 30 year tenure of Sen Onorato and the changes occurring in Astoria at this moment. <br /><br />My walk to the Steinway Subway station takes me along 38th st (if I want to avoid the crowds on Steinway). One portion of this walk is the block of 38th st between 30th ave and 31st Ave. This block contains 9 new apartment bulding that are going up in the place of single dwelling homes. <br /><br />Now think of this. 9 homes that contained maybe 18-21 adults of voting age. Those people, who sold their homes and maybe some moved to Florida were probably solid Onorato voters, And who were they replaced by? From what I see these are 4 story walk ups that have 2 apartments each floor. So what we have is at least 9 x 8 x 2....which equals 144.....<br /><br />Who are these 144 people that replaced the 21. I would hazard a guess that they are not the socially conservative democrats of old. I would hazard a guess that they are the 20-30 year olds that support marriage equality. Sen Onorato&#039;s voters are leaving Astoria and being replaced with progressive people. And his old supporters are being replaced, on that one block, by the tune of six times. <br /><br />Now this isn&#039;t exact. But it is I think a good indication of the changes that have occurred. And it is one that should worry the Senator if he is faced with a strong primary challenger.

				While I would not compare them to the KKK, their ads are plain ridiculous.&nbsp; I would like to think that people could see through just how dumb these ads are, and judging on the amount of parodies made on this ad, I think the ad works against them.&nbsp; This is the ad: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp76ly2_NoI&amp;feature=channel_page&nbsp; Gay marriage is about marriage equality.&nbsp; It is not about a &quot;gathering storm&quot;.&nbsp; It&#039;s not about taking the rights away from straight couples to get married.&nbsp; It&#039;s not about taking away anyone&#039;s freedom or changing the way someone lives.&nbsp; Their message is based on misinformation, outright lies, and ignorance.&nbsp; It acts like the world will come to an end if we allow gay marriage.&nbsp; The ad is laughable, and you would think marriage equality opponents would have better spokesmen on their behalf than this.

				I think the analogy is pretty simple- the KKK believe that black people are &quot;ruining the moral fibers and values&quot; of this country. They believe minorities are &quot;not what this country was founded on&quot;. Their arguments against inter-racial relations are because it&#039;s &quot;un-natural&quot; and it somehow denigrates &quot;the values of the white man&quot;. <br />Seems pretty similar to when I hear anti-same-sex marriage folks preaching that the &quot;un-natural&quot; act of same-sex marriage is somehow &quot;attacking the moral fibers&quot; of their views on marriage.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t believe that all people who are against gay marriage are somehow morally equal to Nazis or the KKK, but the logic behind the argument seems to be the same to me.

But when I read your comments it appears to you define radical as a negative, which leaves me with the impression that you’re arguing both sides of the issue.<br /><br />You may be happy to attend weddings and civil ceremonies of your gay friends.

The central argument in this article seems to be that a child needs a mother and father, as it is his/her &quot;birthright&quot;. Somehow, gay marriage takes away this right?<br />I don&#039;t believe that to be a valid reason for the simple fact that :<br />a) We as a society allow (Voluntarily or involuntarily)single parents to raise a child by themselves. No one argues with those parents that they are somehow stripping away a child&#039;s right to have both parents. It is not illegal to be a single parent. <br />The author puts together a very flimsy response to the single parent issue, saying that children need to recognize that a &quot;non-traditional&quot; parental structure has to be the result of some tragedy, and that right is somehow being denied of the child. That makes absolutely no sense. <br />b) Male-female marriages exist where no children are involved, and are legally recognized. Should we disallow marriages that do not result in a &quot;traditional&quot; family unit?<br />c) What about gay couples that choose to not have children? Are they somehow depriving other children of anything? Parents in &quot;traditional&quot; households are incapable of explaining to children that sometimes a man and a man fall in love?<br /><br />The whole Op Ed piece seems to me like it is using children as a pawn to try to trump up victims that don&#039;t exist in this case. <br />I don&#039;t think I &quot;ignored&quot; anything on this one, I think I just recognized an extremely flimsy argument from the author David Blankenhorn.

Somehow, gay marriage takes away this right?<br />I don&#039;t believe that to be a valid reason for the simple fact that :<br />a) We as a society allow (Voluntarily or involuntarily)single parents to raise a child by themselves. No one argues with those parents that they are somehow stripping away a child&#039;s right to have both parents. It is not illegal to be a single parent. <br />The author puts together a very flimsy response to the single parent issue, saying that children need to recognize that a &quot;non-traditional&quot; parental structure has to be the result of some tragedy, and that right is somehow being denied of the child. That makes absolutely no sense. <br />b) Male-female marriages exist where no children are involved, and are legally recognized. Should we disallow marriages that do not result in a &quot;traditional&quot; family unit?<br />c) What about gay couples that choose to not have children? Are they somehow depriving other children of anything? Parents in &quot;traditional&quot; households are incapable of explaining to children that sometimes a man and a man fall in love?<br /><br />The whole Op Ed piece seems to me like it is using children as a pawn to try to trump up victims that don&#039;t exist in this case. <br />I don&#039;t think I &quot;ignored&quot; anything on this one, I think I just recognized an extremely flimsy argument from the author David Blankenhorn. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Sorry about that.

				There are so many more threats to marriage than allowing same sex couples access to equal treatment.&nbsp; If folks opposing marriage equality wanted to do something to protect marriage, they should focus on strengthening the institution - providing support to families in crisis, making it harder for folks to get married on a whim or something along these lines.&nbsp;

				If, according to “liberal” democrat David Blankenhorn, it’s all about protecting children and providing stable environments what do we say to the children who are beaten and/or killed by their parents each year? <br /><br />I don’t know what world Mr. Blankenhorn lives in, but when has the institution of heterosexual marriage ever guaranteed child safety and development?<br /><br />His opinion is by no means idiotic, but it is certainly not a liberal one<br /><br /><br />One aspect of this debate that hasn’t been stressed enough is that when we talk about opening up marriage to gay people we are talking about <em>civil </em> marriage as granted by the <em>state</em>.<br /><br />The state issuing marriage licenses to gay people in no way infringes upon or obligates religious orders to perform or recognise gay marriages/civil unions as a matter of church practice or theology. <br /><br />In fact, someone can correct me if I’m wrong, but most religions do not recognise civil marriage, as they do not recognize civil divorce.<br /><br />I find it somewhat perplexing that many people are fighting to protect something their religion maintains doesn&#039;t exist in the first place.<br /><br />In the end it’s about fair and equal treatment by the state of all its citizens and of all its families.<br />

				I have to agree with Harlan on this. Elected officials should stand for what they think is right and not based on pressures from constituents and special interest groups. Sometimes the majority has it wrong. Not all voters are well-educated on issues, and a lot of them are homophobic, racists, etc. I expect our representatives to be able to rise above that when the cause calls for it. It gets to be a tricky business, sure, which is why I tend to vote for people that I agree with on a lot of things and not simply someone with a lot of political experience. Politicians who will readily sway to match popular opinion tend to scare me, because a lot of times popular opinion scares me.

That is most certainly in the Senator&#039;s lifetime as well as a good bulk of people on this board.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Since others have addressed the factual error in the post, I want to address the tone of the post. <br /><br />Simply put, no one here, that I am aware of, has accused the Senator of condoning, supporting, establishing or perpetuating Anti interracial marriage laws. That has never been the point of the argument. <br /><br />The point that we are making is that many arguments against same-sex marriages MIRROR the same arguments of those that opposed the mixing of races. I want to take a moment today to address one specific argument. <br /><br />Unnatural. That is the way our society and our government considered interracial marriages. The mixing of the races was unnatural. Simply put, The Whites of the nation were superior and must never be mixed with Negro blood (A term they would have used). <br /><br />Now fast forward to today. The union of two people of the same sex is considered unnatural by some. And, according to the latest NY state poll, now it is less than a majority. 53% of New York supports gay marriage. There are two ways to look at the &quot;Unnatural&quot; argument. Physical and emotional. Physically, I am attracted to another man. Is it natural? I can only answer that in this sense. There are studies that show that homosexual activity occurs in the natural world. Emotionally, I have already addressed my love for the man I live with in this thread. And quite frankly, I am uncertain of how to defend my love for him. It is not something I really intended or thought could happen. But, it is real. More real than some could imagine. <br /><br />What made me the way I am? What made me fall in love with another man? I don&#039;t know how to answer that. For me, It simply what is. <br /><br />What does this have to do with me seeking the right to marry him? Simply put, I want to provide and protect him. And all I am asking for is the ability to do this before the State of New York. <br /><br />

				I agree!<br /><br />As one of my friends so eloquently put it in an email to the Senator: &nbsp;&quot;By not supporting marriage equality, you send a message to everyone you have previously supported that says we are deserving of your pity, but not your equality...&quot;<br /><br />I politely responded and respectfully informed him that I would not be voting from him going forward based solely on his stance on marriage equality. &nbsp;<br /><br />Last Stop - good points.&nbsp; I just wish he would see that his stance should be reconsidered this time around rather than chancing that it will die on the Senate floor once again.<br /><br />Neg nod away - as I said yesterday, I just don&#039;t care and am not giving up this fight anytime soon.

				Yes, anecdotal evidence is weak proof of both sides of the debate&nbsp; Instead, we should be looking to polls.&nbsp; Now, I&#039;m pretty sure there hasn&#039;t been any formal polls conducted in Onorato&#039;s dist., but if you just look to national polls (such as this one:&nbsp; http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/05/04/cnn-poll-generational-gap-on-gay-marriage/ (http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/05/04/cnn-poll-generational-gap-on-gay-marriage/)) you&#039;d see that the majority of those under 35 support gay marriage.&nbsp; Also, keep in mind, the median age for most of Astoria is lower to mid 30s.&nbsp; Yes, there&#039;s a large percentage of transients under the age of 40 in this neighborhood, but there always will be and those numbers are only going to hold, if not grow larger if this neighborhood continues its gradual gentrification.

				This is the letter my partner sent to the Senator. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I believe all New York families should be treated equally under the law.<br /><br />I am proud to live in a state like New York where everyone is treated with respect and dignity, and it is time that our laws reflect that respect and dignity.<br /><br />You recently stated that your district does not support equal rights for gay people.&nbsp; Sir, I urge you to take a look around Astoria today.&nbsp; We are not the same population who voted you into office two decades ago.&nbsp; Within the last five years Astoria has been literally flooded with young men and women.&nbsp; We are pouring out of Manhattan in search of more affordable rents. <br /><br />We love this village, and the swell of our population has demanded the creation of many new businesses, and revived many older establishments.&nbsp; So many of us are young actors, singers, and dancers.&nbsp; So many of us are gay; and so many of the young straights have gay friends and relatives whom they know and love.&nbsp; Senator, your district has radically changed.&nbsp; Please take a walk down 30th Ave or Broadway between Steinway and 31st Street on a Saturday or Sunday. The population of Astoria has changed.&nbsp; I urge you to vote in favor of same sex marriage - Equality for All Astorians.&nbsp; That is what we want.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Cameron Folmar<br /><br />

				I looked at the crosstabs of the Siena Poll done on 4/13 and it found that 71% of 18-34 year old supports gay marriage. Only 20% are opposed. <br /><br />http://www.siena.edu/uploadedFiles/Home/Parents_and_Community/Community_Page/SRI/SNY_Poll/SNY0409%20Crosstabs.pdf (http://www.siena.edu/uploadedFiles/Home/Parents_and_Community/Community_Page/SRI/SNY_Poll/SNY0409%20Crosstabs.pdf)

The way I interpret that is you saying that the older Astorians would be the ones against gay marriage. The conclusion I drew is that your view is that the older folks stick to older ways, and that is who Onorato is trying to appease, and should be appeasing because they voted for him in the past. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=14620.msg173433.html#msg173433">Quote from: Sweeper on May 14, 2009, 10:29:49 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Maybe it&#039;s not me.

I think A and B don&#039;t have to be mutually exclusive, but there is a very fine line to cross. A conscience is completely subjective- and when it comes to legality, one should be voting on a basis of what can be argued in ethical terms. <br />And as far as B goes- if he really was representing his constituents that well, I think he would take into account this &quot;new elite&quot; that you spoke of. These are current and future voters, and at some point- the &quot;original Astorians&quot; were the same thing- young people moving into the neighborhood trying to make a home for themselves. Sure, people move in and out, but it is an unfair assumption to say that if I don&#039;t plan on living here forever, my political concerns shouldn&#039;t be as valid or equally represented. <br />

They are parents and grandparents who have raised their children and sent them to the same school where they went to school. They are people who watch their sons and daughters play on the same fields that they played on 30 years ago.</span><br /><br />Maybe I should have been clearer: I am and my family are core constituents. We have lived here for 80 years. We have been voting for George for the past 25 years. <br /><br />Although I don&#039;t know him personally, we have met at events on occasion and my parents and aunts and uncles are contemporaries and know him as well as everyone else at the Taminent club. <br /><br />Defining the constituency as being made up of little old ladies leading families who’ve lived here for generations is nostalgic at best -- thats what I meant as being stuck in the 60s. <br /><br />Your view seems to be that the people who vote for Oronato are 100% against gay marriage. My view is that yes, some are, but some aren’t and I am one of them and although I can&#039;t speak for how the rest of my family votes, I would take a guess that, many if not most, have supported Oronato AND support gay marriage.<br /><br />It&#039;s not just the new &#039;elites&#039; as you label them who would like him to vote yes on gay marriage and they have just as much the right to lobby their state senator to change his mind as do the old school brigade.<br /><br />Oronato is free to vote his conscience but as a core constituent I feel my views should be taken into consideration.<br />

We found a rent stabilized 4 room apartment at a price I won&#039;t quote because it will make some jealous. Which has much more room than we had on the Upper West Side. He lived in an SRO about 8 x 10 and I rented a sleeping loft above the entrance way of a walk up. When we decided to move, we ended up in Astoria because it was what we could afford and because we love the neighborhood. And it&#039;s been a great 5 years. Over time our neighbors up and down the block have become friends. They talk to us every day we see them. And these guys are definitely old Astoria. Margaret has been her for at least 30 years. And I can&#039;t imagine for a moment that they don&#039;t know we are partners. It&#039;s not like we announce, but I am sure that after all the conversations we&#039;ve had, they have figured it out. I guess what I am trying to say is that we feel like we belong here. Not just that our apartment is our home....but Astoria is our home.

I am not one of those guys who think lesbians are greatest thing since the motorcycle.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />I know it will lead to more adoption by gays, which I think is child cruelty. And yes, I know kids are not well off as orphans, but issue is not related.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s no good to have to explain to kids why two guys/two women&nbsp; are holding hands, kissing,&nbsp; or whatever.&nbsp; &nbsp; Kids copy what they see,&nbsp; I don&#039; t want to find my son playing house with some boy he&#039;s friends with because he&#039;s seeing more and more gay&nbsp; stuff on television shows and movies. I don&#039;t like that high schools all have gay &quot;Support groups&quot; which are a tricky way of taking confused kids and steering them in that direction<br />I think homosexuality is&nbsp; abnormal.&nbsp; So do many others.&nbsp; So does most of the world. However, I&#039;m not a &#039;Let&#039;s kill them!!&quot; type, or into beating them up.&nbsp; <br /><br />Two guys on my team in pool league are gay.&nbsp; They know my opinion.

I did not want him as President, but since he won, he&#039;s now my president and I accept it.<br /><br />I don&#039;t consider marriage of gays a civil rights issue.&nbsp; It&#039;s my opinion.&nbsp; If peole wanted to marry in threesomes, I&#039;d be against that too. <br /><br />I could go on, but I&#039;m not getting paid for this, and my fingers are tired of typing. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

I really feel that you have been honest in your last post. I, myself, cannot condemn anyone for being uncomfortable with the concept of me marrying my boyfriend. I must admit it is strange.......and for me perfectly natural. Joey, I want to defend him in the same way you would want to defend your wife. <br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

I, and a few others, cited actual facts and similarities between the gay marriage issue and civil rights issues (NOT slavery, Civil Rights- just so we can be clear here)<br /><br />Secondly, I think everything else you wrote in this response is despicable, and here is why: Your argument against homosexuality in all of these examples leads me to believe that you think of homosexuals as lesser-beings. <br /><br />You have a guy in your pool league who is gay and your agreement was that you would not bring it up? Wow- that is like me telling my black friend we can be friends as long as the subject of his being black does not come up. Gay is who the guy in your pool league is- and I find that low and despicable that the only way you can get along is if his being gay is not talked about. <br /><br />And do you know anything about gay support groups? You talk about them like they&#039;re a conspiracy of people trying to turn teenagers gay. Do you remember high school at all? Teenagers are cruel and abusive and torment anyone who&#039;s different(Clearly, from what I&#039;ve been reading on this thread some adults are as well). These support groups are there to help people having to repress who they are because people like you will only be friends with them if they don&#039;t tell you they&#039;re gay, and they get classified as lesser people.&nbsp; <br /><br />And the only thing in this past post that I can even consider close to what would resemble an argument is &quot;It&#039;s not normal&quot; and &quot;I don&#039;t want my kids to be gay&quot;. Really well-rationalized argument there...&nbsp; :roll:

To me, this is the danger of the whole anti-gay thing-some kids grow up mentally (and sometimes physically) damaged from this stigma against homosexuality.

Until they do have equal treatment, they cannot start to be considered by society as equal people- which is particularly why I perceive it to be a civil rights issue. <br /><br />In regards to your not labeling yourself liberal any more, I can see where you are coming from. To be fair, however, the cultural strong-arming is a byproduct of the bipartisan system, not the liberals or conservatives. This country has been down such a path of &quot;You&#039;re either red or blue since there&#039;s no in-between&quot;, that it&#039;s sad.

				Well my feeling is that we can agree to disagree.&nbsp; I appreciate JoeyC for being honest.&nbsp; I now know from whence he comes.&nbsp; Unless you try to understand someone else&#039;s position, motives remain unclear sometimes.&nbsp; As for me, I know I was born gay, and that community pressure kept me from coming out for a very long time.&nbsp; That is something I didn&#039;t understand for a long time as well.&nbsp; There is no &quot;conversion&quot; or being &quot;gay by proxy.&quot;&nbsp; NYC is a great example of having bars, restaurants, etc. where gay and straight people hang out, on a daily basis, without harm or concern on either side.&nbsp; I know.&nbsp; I work at one of them.&nbsp; The straight people never feel threatened by the gay people, and vice-versa.&nbsp; I know it is one example in one city, but I feel it is a microcosm of NYC as a whole.&nbsp; Nowhere on earth do you find such a large number of different cultures and subcultures living, coexisting, on a daily basis.&nbsp; That is what makes NYC special.&nbsp; I think this issue can coexists with all of the other issues here in this forum.&nbsp; I will continue to say that it is a civil rights issue, simply because personal civil rights are being infringed upon, as being gay is not a &quot;choice,&quot; but who a person is.

				I have been thinking, over the last two days, of an important element to this debate that seems to come up over and over again. And that is the comparison of the LGBT rights struggle to the African-American rights struggle. <br /><br />First off, I want to say this. I have come to the realization that there are two key elements in my fight for marriage equality. They are the personal fight and the societal fight. Everyone who has been reading this thread is aware of the personal stake I have in this. Tonight, I want to address the societal stake in this. <br /><br />A few weeks ago, when the Maine Senate held their hearing regarding marriage equality, I heard a comment from a gay teenager that struck home to me and put into words what I instinctively knew. <br /><br />He said that (and I am paraphrasing) as long as Maine writes discrimination into their laws, they are giving permission for the citizens to discriminate against me. <br /><br />This is how I see it and why I think it as parallel to the Black civil rights movement. Civil unions and domestic partner registries are second class systems. They seek to address something that I desire. But, in a way that is discriminatory. The laws create a parallel system that is not equal to what heterosexuals have. And by doing so they are allowing people to think that we are less than them. I remember about three or four years ago when 3 gay men were attacked in Astoria. These attacks occurred during the same month that Congress was considering a Constitutional amendment to make marriage only between a man and a woman. I recall that year as the year that Karl Rove et al decided that same sex marriage was the wedge issue that would win Bush a second term. I am not saying that it is an exact correlation, just that the trends in gay bashing rose during the period the Congress was debating. <br /><br />Now, Why do I think this relates to the Black civil rights movement? Because ultimately, they were trying to erase the same type of laws that created a second class system that dehumanized them. The government back then gave permission to whites to abuse and even kill blacks. Every separate drinking fountain and separate bathroom and separate dining areas perpetuated the separate but equal myth that we now know is false. And perpetuated the dehumanizing treatment of Blacks. <br /><br />As has been discussed previously, I am unaware of any claim of the LGBT rights movement being the same as the Black civil rights movement. It is my belief that there are differences. For example, I know that not a single gay person was denied the right to vote, as long as they were white. However, I am stunned that there are African-Americans that cannot see the relation between my struggle and what they struggled for. <br /><br />As I said in a previous post, a member of the New York State Assembly said what I believe to be true; &quot;I believe that Matthew Shepard was Lynched, they just didn&#039;t use a rope&quot;.<br /><br />Ultimately, as long as society thinks that I am less than equal, they have permission to hate me, discriminate against me, and yes, even kill me. <br /><br />

				We went to the rally this afternoon -- great turnout, the usual political cast of characters, celebs, performances, etc. The message -- the single most important message that they tried to get out -- was to contact our state senators. It&#039;s disheartening, though, to know that the person who represents our district is so opposed to it that all the calling, e-mailing, and letter writing will do nothing to change his position. <br /><br />My family has been in Astoria since the 50&#039;s. My mom and uncle graduated from Bryant H.S. After my mom got married, she returned to Astoria and raised her family here. I was born here at the old Boulevard Hospital on 31st Avenue. I graduated from PS 17 and IS 126. I spent years as a girl scout in the basement of the Methodist Church on Crescent Street. I still live here, now with my partner. We&#039;ve been engaged since 2006. My 93 year old grandmother still lives 4 blocks away. She adores my partner and is completely accepting of me and my life. So when people talk about what the native Astorians want vs. the newcomers, well, I *am* a native Astorian. My grandmother is a longtime Astorian. And we want marriage equality and we want it now.<br /><br />My mom was an Onorato supporter and I vividly recall when he first ran for state senate. But that was 26 years ago. Things have changed around here, Onorato has not. What was once a constituency primarily of immigrants and blue collar workers is now a neighborhood of young professionals -- educated, and progressive. That he&#039;s so unaware of who he represents is bad enough, but that he&#039;s so uninterested in finding out is downright appalling. I&#039;m sure he&#039;s not concerned about reelection -- the man is 80 years old. He&#039;s not voting against this because of what he believes his constituency wants, he&#039;s voting against this because it&#039;s what HE wants. That&#039;s not why we elected him. I&#039;m sorry to say I voted for him. Like many Astorians, I voted on name recognition, not on the issues.<br /><br />It would be a shame if Onorato&#039;s legacy of a committment to serving the people of this community is marred by a single vote on the wrong side of history.

				A friend of mine may be moving to Canada because of marriage equality issues.<br /><br />Her partner is a native of Trinidad, and has been in the US on a student visa for several years.&nbsp; When the visa is up, she&#039;s going to have to leave the country.&nbsp; They want to get married, not just for the immigration aspect, but because they love each other and want to spend the rest of their lives together.&nbsp; But without recognition on a national level of their union, even if they get married in a state that permits it, she won&#039;t be able to stay.&nbsp; The rate things are progressing at the state level around the country is giving them hope that they may be able to stay here, near family and friends who love them, but it&#039;s still really up in the air.<br /><br />It makes me sick that an American citizen would have to move to another country in order to have the freedom to marry the person she loves.<br /><br />

				love those tshirts. :)<br /><br /><br />There are plenty of people who I think shouldn&#039;t get married or have children.

And I know it&#039;s inappropriate for me to take responsibility for their choices.

So I get over it. <br /><br />If I hear from my cousin that she can&#039;t wait for her drug peddling cheating ex to get out of jail so they can try again .. it really does make me feel sick at my stomach. Way, way sicker than seeing a couple of guys kissing (which actually doesn&#039;t make me sick at all and which, you know, you can&#039;t keep your kids from seeing regardless of whether or not marriage equality passes). But again, it&#039;s not my responsibility. Not my decision. However it makes me feel has no bearing on its legality. I may think it&#039;s sick, screwed up, or crazy, and I may even be right, but it&#039;s still recognized by the state.

Having interned for a congressman in college, they get flooded daily with letters, emails, calls, etc. from constituents regarding simple issues, as well as the most relevant ones. <br />I do know that every issue raised by a constituent does get logged via a computer system(At least on the federal congressional level) that every congressman has, and they get reports weekly on what the most pressing issues are to their constituency- and the person who wrote in and their concern is logged and saved on the system. <br /><br />Don&#039;t let the form letters discourage you- your voice, as small as it may seem, does get heard. Keep writing your representatives about this issue. <br /><br />What a flood of letters would tell him is that if he wants to get re-elected, this is what the constituency wants.

				One&#039;s voice may be &quot;heard&quot; but whether it is listened to is another story.&nbsp; I also interned for an elected official, at the federal level, and I can attest to the fact that every letter, phone call, fax and e-mail was indeed logged.&nbsp; However, I can also attest to the fact that the elected official tended to vote against that majority more often than not on those pressing issues.

				Aside from marriage equality for same sex couples, Onorato has a perfect record on LGBT issues.&nbsp; He voted for Hate Crimes, the Sexual Orientation Non-Discrimination Act (SONDA), the Dignity for All Students Act (anti-bullying) and for GENDA, which prohibits discrimination against transgender people.&nbsp; Overall his record is good - but marriage remains a big concern.&nbsp; He is, however, to be commended for his other votes - he&#039;s a good and decent man, though I disagree strongly with him on this issue.

You don&#039;t have to be in or out of touch to know that it&#039;s wrong to beat or even kill someone because they&#039;re LGBT. You don&#039;t have to be in or out of touch to get that gay students shouldn&#039;t have to face bullying or menacing at school (and DFAS isn&#039;t aimed specifically at LGBT students -- it encompasses race, color, weight, ethnicity, religion and disability as well). You don&#039;t have to be in or out of touch to recognize that it&#039;s wrong to discriminate against someone because of the way they express their gender. <br /><br />In an area as diverse as NYC, yes, these are necessary protections. Onorato pats himself on the back for supporting these measures, but when it comes time to giving the LGBT community a basic, fundamental right that heterosexual people have and we don&#039;t, he balks. To me, that speaks volumes about where he stands with respect to the LGBT community.

				Does anyone who is knowledgeable about local politics know whether there is anyway to remove a sitting state senator (or other elected official) from office prior to an election? Or is there some way to complain and have him reprimanded, or removed from committees he&#039;s sitting on for this kind of deplorable behavior? These are his constituents. These are the people he represents and he&#039;s directed the gatekeepers of his office to reject anyone who wants to discuss this incredibly important issue. There&#039;s got to be some way to censure him. This goes beyond same sex marriage -- there could be a myriad of issues that he is unwilling to meet with constituents about and the community should know that this is the response that the voters of this area receive when they try to address them with their elected representative. <br /><br />There should be protests outside of his office. Maybe that will make him realize how he&#039;s wronging this community.

				Way to go Brandon!<br /><br />I think it is absolutely ridiculous that he won&#039;t meet on this issue at all, but on others he will. This is clearly a concern for many of his constituents, and the fact that he refuses to even sit down to talk about it indicates he is not only out of touch, but unfit to be a state senator. <br /><br />Secondly, if his assistant was smart, she would have responded with &quot;We don&#039;t have the time to meet personally on all issues&quot;, rather than &quot;He absolutely will not speak to anyone about gay marriage&quot;. That was a complete bonehead thing to say on her part, but at least the cat is out of the bag, and we now know what kind of state senator he is.

				They did meet, a friend of mine went.&nbsp; The report I heard was that Onorato has moved his position slightly, he said he &quot;will not stand in the way of gay marriage&quot;.&nbsp; Which is still a ways from supporting it, up in Albany it&#039;s easy to not stand in the way of something while it dies in committee, but it&#039;s a change from I&#039;m against it.&nbsp; So it is working.<br /><br />And it&#039;s certainly not bullying to have people call your elected official to advocate for something, that&#039;s how things are done and that&#039;s why elected officials have staffers answer their phones.&nbsp; If you&#039;re going to say that not enough people in your district support something, like Onorato did for gay marriage, then he has to expect that people are going to try and prove him wrong by getting constituents to call in.&nbsp; And as I said, seems to be working.

				Ruben Diaz needs to STFU. It&#039;s one thing to be opposed to marriage equality as a private citizen, it&#039;s another to (ab)use your position as an elected official as a pulpit for your religious rhetoric. People elected you to represent them, not your church.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Diaz also said that senators who did not publicly voice their support for the bill were &quot;ashamed to be publicly associated with the gay community.&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I hope his colleagues in the senate see this and are vocal about how assinine this statement is.<br /><br />http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/100201/lawmakers-maintain-divide-over-gay-marriage-bill/Default.aspx (http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/100201/lawmakers-maintain-divide-over-gay-marriage-bill/Default.aspx)<br /><br />

				In other news, Sen. Onorato is now Twittering, but not about Marriage Equality.&nbsp; Some Gay Organizations are following him though.&nbsp; Go here to read his Tweets:&nbsp; http://twitter.com/SenOnorato (http://twitter.com/SenOnorato)

				Indications are that Gov Paterson has put the Marriage Equality bill on hold for now. Indications are that he may call for a special session in the fall.<br /><br />I&#039;m of two minds about this. On one hand, I&#039;m upset because of all the hard work that went into lobbying for this bill. On the other hand, I&#039;m more inclined to wait until a time when the Senate can have a serious debate on this bill. <br /><br /><br /><br />
