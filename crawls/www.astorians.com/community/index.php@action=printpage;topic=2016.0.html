				I remember Jennifer mentioned either a particular restaurant or a kind of cuisine for May&#39;s EATS evening.&nbsp; I don&#39;t recall what she said, but I do remember being excited about it.&nbsp; So...where we goin&#39; in May?&nbsp; And when?&nbsp; My preference is to move it back to Friday, but all&#39;s cool.

				Hrmm, sounds deelish! According to their website, seems like Friday nights are when they do the whole folk music/live band/dancing party. So I&#39;d like to vote for one of those. Right now I&#39;m good for any weekend except the last one (also known as Memorial Day weekend - I&#39;ll be out of town).

				Did anyone else see yesterday&#39;s Metro? In the Cool in Your Code section it was about music. And they totally had a piece on what else...Bulgara. OK, so who here leaked out our newest place? Its like we have our finger on the hip pulse here my peeps! go us!!! (or jonathan and jennifer for finding it anyway...) So i think we need to solidify our plan before this place becomes the next beer garden and we are hipster&#39;d out of it. I see we hit a stall, i still think the 19th has the most votes though. <br />So here&#39;s the tentative list for the 19th as i see it:<br /><br />flooz<br />annie<br />eric<br />hikaruhana<br />lanseaux<br />thatjimguy<br />jennifer<br />jonathan<br />goldfish boy<br />&nbsp;<br />who else?

				Ok, we can offer two seats to Bulgara, three if someone doesn&#39;t mind riding on the handlebars. <br /><br />Just kidding.&nbsp; Josh and Harlan have claimed the two seats, but we can probably squeeze a third person in as well.<br /><br />We can offer a ride back as well if the party breaks up before 11.

				Hey, it looks like I&#39;m going to have to go there directly from work, so does anyone have any suggestions of the right train to take?&nbsp; The Bulgara website lists about a million trains going to three different stations, so I&#39;m just wondering which one might get me closest to the restaurant.

				Wow.&nbsp; What a great time!!<br /><br />I do have to say that if you don&#39;t eat pork, Bulgara may not be for you.<br /><br />But it was good, really good.&nbsp; Jim and I started with a Shopska salad, which was &quot;Tomatoes, Cucumbers, Roasted Peppers, Onion, Parsley, Feta Cheese in Olive Oil and Vinegar&quot;.&nbsp; The feta was grated Bulgarian feta - very salty, but incredibly creamy and tangy.&nbsp; I think it&#39;s the best feta I&#39;ve ever had.&nbsp; We then had beef tongue sauteed in butter, followed by a small platter of thin sliced dried sausage - one was like a miniature prosciutto, but much milder and less salty, with an oregano finish, and the other was a denser, composite meat with cumin.&nbsp; Also quite mild in flavour.&nbsp; I enjoyed them very much.&nbsp; We also had tastes of the tripe sauteed in butter (still not really a tripe fan) and a bite of Flooz&#39;s &quot;Roasted Green Peppers - Garlic, Parsley, Oil and Vinegar&quot;, which was fantastic.&nbsp; I could go back and eat a couple of them straight.&nbsp; We split the mixed grill as the entree - that would be &quot;Grilled [pork] Sausage, Pork Patty, Pork Chop and Pork Skewer&quot;.&nbsp; The sausage was amazingly light in texture, and the pork skewer was juicy and flavourful.&nbsp; The pork patty was basically another type of sausage, also very good with a different spice mix.&nbsp; The mixed grill was a great way to sample a number of things on the menu.&nbsp; Near the end of the meal, the grilled mushrooms stuffed with bits of fried bacon that Harlan had ordered as an appetiser finally appeared, which was a shame, because they were fantastic, but we just couldn&#39;t finish them.&nbsp; Deep mushroom flavour combined with really good bacon.&nbsp; We also had a little baklava (ordered by Harlan) - not with honey, but simple syrup, and walnuts - and something called Tolumba, which looked like nothing other than a thick, short churro.&nbsp; But it was cold, doughier, and covered with a sweet syrup.&nbsp; Served with whipped cream, it was a little bit of adventure and not bad, but not really my favourite type of dessert.<br /><br />There were a few misses along the way, but overall, Jim and I were really impressed with the food.&nbsp; Despite having so many meat-oriented dishes on the menu, the vegetable dishes we sampled were really delicious.&nbsp; In addition to the apps we tried, the mixed grill came with a spicy, savoury-sweet roasted red pepper spread - Jonathan, help me out here with the name - that you can buy it in jars at the Euro Market on 31st St., and also Titan Foods and other Greek supermarkets; also cannelloni beans with onions and spices, and mashed potatoes with onions.<br /><br />Jim and I really enjoyed ourselves, and it was great to see everyone.&nbsp; And props to Cary for hauling out the Moon Pies, the mini Moon Pies and the Goo Goo Clusters at the end!!&nbsp; It&#39;s certainly the first time I&#39;ve ever sat in a Bulgarian restaurant eating a Goo Goo Cluster. ;)<br /><br />I&#39;ll let others talk about the videos on the big screen tv....
