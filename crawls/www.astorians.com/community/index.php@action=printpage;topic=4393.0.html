				I&#39;m an astorians junkie. I have been hooked for a couple of years. It is my drug of choice. I break out in cold sweats and my hands shake when the site goes down—or worse yet—when my computer goes down. I need to have a few daily fixes to satisfy my need. I sometimes fight the urge, but it always gets the best of me. I am *never* going to quit it. I get all tingly when I can&#39;t sleep and sign in and find that I am alone there with 15 spiders. I don&#39;t need your help, thank you. I just came to this meeting to tell you that we are in a very exclusive group of adictees. No shame here. astorians.com rules.

				Hi Dirk. Hi Jonathan. Welcome.<br /><br />We respectfully request that you continue to cooperate with us in maintaining the anonymity of our members. The principle of anonymity is a basic tenet of our fellowship. Those who are reluctant to seek our help may overcome their fear if they are confident that their anonymity will be respected. In addition, and perhaps less understood, the tradition of anonymity acts as a restraint on our members, reminding us that we are a program of principles, not personalities, and that no individual AA member may presume to act as a spokesman or leader of our fellowship. If an AA member is identified in the media, we ask that you please use first names onlyand that you not use photographs or electronic images in which member&#39;s faces may be recognized.

				Hi everyone, my name is Vin and I have been an Astoriaholic since about year after moving to Astoria. I have to say that joining this board has only fostered my addiction to Astoria to the point that when this board goes down, I find myself walking the streets of Astoria with my keyboard in hand, crying, mumbling the name &quot;Merm&quot;, &quot;Merm&quot;. <br />I do not plan to give Astorians up anytime soon and for that I have been told I have issues, issues that I need to deal with, that is what has brought me here today. Thank You.

Please refrain from addressing each other as &#39;yo junkie&#39; as that is also frowned upon. You may not use your laptops at these meetings and if you are caught doing so, it will be confiscated and you will therefore be unable to even check your email.<br /><br />Please look to your left . . . now look to your right . . . be sure that you are not sitting alongside either your roommate, your spouse, your baby Mama or baby Daddy or your lover. You will get to know *them* better as the cure starts taking effect.<br /><br />Please take a seat. No you may not sit on anyone&#39;s lap!<br /><br />Now please come to order.<br /><br />Will all the new people please come to the front and tell us your name and the degree of your addiction. Sorry, no flasks are allowed at the meetings.<br /><br />Please raise your primary hand so that we may check for calluses . . . NOT FROM THAT . . . . from the mouse.<br /><br />If you people don&#39;t want to cooperate with the program, then get out of here.

				Hi everyone.<br /><br />I&#39;m Matt, and I&#39;m not only a user, I&#39;m an enabler too. In my own way I suppose I&#39;m trying to get others to share my addiction so I don&#39;t have to deal with the fear of coming home to a blank computer screen.<br /><br />I simply. can&#39;t. stop. But I&#39;m grateful for this group.

				Hello everyone....<br /><br />My name is Liz and it all started because I wanted to access more information on Astoria, and that is the reason that I&#39;m on so often, it is for the sole purpose of seeking information and acquiring knowledge. &nbsp;Since this is a very &quot;Live&quot; board, it&#39;s very difficult to stay off it because you just don&#39;t know when new information/news/educational stuff is going to be added. &nbsp;I would like to place something in the suggestion box and perhaps create sort of an on running tickler, just like NASDAQ or the NYSE, the ones the brokers use to obtain instant information. &nbsp;I believe that would be perfect, a streaming live line of pure knowledge. &nbsp;I have acquired much cerebral advancement during the time I have invested here but I feel that if I miss a moment my brain cells will start dying off and brain cells are the one cells that do not reproduce, once they&#39;re gone, they&#39;re gone. &nbsp;Henceforth...it is a necessary evil to visit this board so frequently. &nbsp;Thank you all for such enrichment...I feel SO educated. &nbsp;Additionally, there is such an array of people, photographers, handymen, and the list goes on, why even bother to go out when it&#39;s all right here, on my flat screen. &nbsp;<br /><br />Hmmmmmmm, maybe I should invest in a larger screen.<br /><br />That&#39;s a possibility.

				Welcome, Liz. <br /><br />I wouldn&#39;t really worry about your loss of brain cells. It is already a well known fact that if you live and work in New York City, you lose 1 IQ point for every 2 years you live here.

				hi i&#39;m jenn, i&#39;m an astorians.com addict<br /><br />i&#39;ve been hooked for over a year now. i can&#39;t stand it when work gets in the way of my checking the boards. i try to keep a tab open so i can check in when i am in between tasks, or if i just don&#39;t feel like working. there are some days when all i do is obsessively check the board and i get extremely antsy when there aren&#39;t new posts, or the new posts are topics i am not interested in. sometimes when i really need a fix, i&#39;ll read old topics or topics i am not even really interested in. for example-and this may get me shot-i cannot stand thai food (ducks for cover) when there aren&#39;t enough new posts, i&#39;ll read about the new thai places. <br />i may not post as often as others but i sure do read a lot. i hate it when my dsl at home is super slow and it takes forever to get to a new post, it drives me mad! <br />i also try and recruit people and tell them all about the site. i guess i&#39;m trying to justify my addiction. <br />don&#39;t think i can stop, and don&#39;t think i want to stop.<br /><br />i&#39;m an astorians.com addict

				Just returning to this thread to tell you all that I just came online to turn my auto-responder on my email on because I&#039;m off on vacation for a week. Woo, spring break.&nbsp; :rock:<br /><br />Anyway, yes. I&#039;m totally addicted to Astorians because I was all, &quot;well, if I&#039;m online anyway, let&#039;s just see if anyone wrote anything new.&quot; If anyone finds a girl on the beach in Aruba suffering from withdrawals, it is me, and I am having withdrawals from lack of Astorians. Eeeeeeee!<br /><br />(Also, I woke up in a panic this morning because it just hit me that I graduate soon. PANIC! But for now I will only try to worry about the beach.)<br /><br />Ok, now I&#039;m really going. Promise.

				***bump***<br /><br />This meeting will please come to order. As a result of the recent outage, we felt it necessary to call an emergency meeting of this AA group. Many of you have experienced withdrawal symptoms and have pulled through. We congratulate you all.<br /><br />Please, be quiet in the rear . . . thank you.<br /><br />Feel free to sit down to your keyboard and put your fingers on the home keys—okay you don&#039;t have to use the home keys it is all right for you to use the same 2 fingers that you usually do—and tell us what it was like for you.<br /><br />Who wants to go first?<br /><br />Please state your name and start your posting with &quot;I am an Astorians addict&quot; thank you.<br /><br />As this meeting was called in the last minute, there will be no coffee and cookies served. Also, please refrain from drinking or smoking.<br /><br />Thank you.

				My astorians addiction started like most. I was just a teenager, and I was over at a friends house. He said &quot;you got to try this thing out&quot;...To which I replied &quot;Pot?&quot;. he said no. Thats when he introduced me to astorians.com. Before long, I was stealing money from my parents to goto the local internet cafe. When I couldnt find the money, I would often beg the clerk for an astorians.com him, but he rarely budged. Since those early days, I&#039;ve acquired quite the rap sheet, doing crimes to feed my addiction. Many of these things I am not proud of. I wish I could go back in time and talk to my young self, sit him down, explain to him how it is. But I can&#039;t. That young man is long gone, and this old crook is all thats left.....<br /><br />
