				hi urrisgrl,<br /><br />i&#39;ve been hearing a bunch of great things about locale&#39;s brunch these days though i personally have never tried it. <br /><br />went to locale w a friend last night for the first time and had the seafood specials then stayed for some drinks. the seafood was excellent -- fresh, perfectly grilled and very tasty. the dark chocolate mousse cake was so great we seriously scraped off every last bit of the chocolate. the drinks were good too (tried the french martini, the expresso martini and the chocolate martini.) <br /><br />give it a try. i&#39;ll be back for brunch without a doubt.

				Hi Zaharaula-<br /><br />Thanks for the info. I am definately interested in checking out Locale. And I actually tried Stove this weekend 28th Ave and 46th (I think). It was really good! The menu is not extensive- but good. I had the chicken special in a Djion mustard sauce and my husband had the Sole special. We were both really happy with what we ordered and thought the price was very reasonable for the portion size. The only thing I did not get excited over was the bread that they severed- very plain, and tasteless- but other than that everything was good! Thanks for your input.<br /><br />Urrisgirl&nbsp; &nbsp;:-D

				I stopped by Stove yesterday myself. They&#39;ve been there about 3 months I think.<br />A waitress described the menu as American Bistro. And said they are going to have a garden patio in the back soon. They just have to decorate it now.&nbsp; <br />http://newyork.citysearch.com/review/41865137<br />Here is the review from Citysearch.&nbsp; <br /><br />Where is Locale?<br />

				<br />Its on 34th avenue and I think 33rd or 34th street. I&#39;ve heard great things about it- haven&#39;t been there myself yet.

				So right! The fried artichokes are the best thing about this place. Some people think the vibe is too pretentious; I think its ok. The drinks are good (though not cheap) and the paninis are reasonable. Nothing spectacular, except those fried artichoke apps. Their wine selection is respectable but nothing that Brick can&#39;t beat. All in all, its a good time, but by no means the best bistro in Astoria. See an earlier thread that I had started about this place earlier this year:<br />http://astorians.com/index.php?topic=1384.0<br />

				Thanks. It is interesting to hear the differing opinions. Will have to check it out. I know this is an Astoria website- but I do have another restaurant recommendation- Bliss or Bliss Gardens as it is known on their website. It is located on Skillman Ave in Sunnyside and I believe 46th or 45th street. Its relatively knew- but the food is lovely and so is the atmosphere.
