				There is a new spa that will be opening today on Ditmars right next to Tara Nail Salon.&nbsp; There are pictures of people getting massages on the front window.&nbsp; I wonder what this place will be like.&nbsp; I think this will be competition for Tara Nail Salon.

				Wellfunny this place opens up just abt the time the one on 24ave just closed down . And that one was a happy ending place as so many tug and rub sites on line have stated .&nbsp; &nbsp;We shall see with this new one&nbsp; but when windows are all blocked out like that to me it looks kinda shady .&nbsp;

				These places are all pretty curtained up, even legit ones.&nbsp; There&#039;s a place on broadway next to D&amp;D (i think&nbsp; it&#039;s called spring bodywork?) that for years I just assumed was an R&amp;T joint until recently someone told me it was a legit place.

				I think they charge $65 an hour.&nbsp; I go to an acupuncture office in the city on 34th St. for acupressure massage that is really great and only costs $30 for 1/2 an hour.&nbsp; Here is the website if you want to check it out.&nbsp; I recommend them highly.&nbsp; www.go2acupuncture.com (http://www.go2acupuncture.com)&nbsp;

				If people are interested in non-sexual massages, I&#039;m addicted to voucher sites like Groupon, LivingSocial, Bloomspot, LifeBooker, etc. They constantly offer amazing massage deals - usually in Manhattan - but I&#039;ve gotten a few from Astoria places like iSpa and Spa Hydra. Blossom on 31st and Ditmars seem to always be running specials for mani/pedi/massages (all three for around $50 or $60).

I think that used to be the tattoo parlor. Never seen a girl in there, only male masseuses.<br /><br />There&#039;s actually another Anna&#039;s foot spa on Steinway and 21th Ave. All covered up as well.

				The new one on Ditmars across from&nbsp; TradeFair does Reflexology and someone i know just went the other day and she said it was awesome . No one tried anything or asked her anything funny .&nbsp; Then again&nbsp; if it was a guy going in , maybe it wouldve been different ? who knows .&nbsp; My other friend did go to Cherry Spa on Ditmars and he only wanted a regular massage and the girl who worked on him insisted he gets more . After he refused she kept calling him cheap .&nbsp; &nbsp;I dont know how these places have no fear at all .

				Just found this somewhat graphic review of New Cherry Spa which confirms again that they are indeed prostitutes right out in the open. Even the reviewer mentioned how residential the neighborhood was and the fact that they were right out in the open. Definitely NSFW. <br /><br /><br />http://utopiaguide.com/forums/showthread.php?t=46394

				&nbsp;<br />I don’t think this is a big deal, some people don’t have the luxury of having a wife or gf to release some of their stress so they have to pay for it....otherwise stress builds up and can lead to someone going crazy and doing something bad.....it’s not for everyone, don’t like it?

I think they should make effort to not be obvious at all though.&nbsp; There are sites that advertise these places,plus word of mouth.&nbsp; I rather&nbsp; they don&#039;t make it look like red light district, or like they are accepted part of community.&nbsp;

				<br />There are plenty of places to get a handjob. There&#039;s never been a shortage of prostitutes in the world. It is however illegal and attracts the type of people who run illegal operations in plain sight, boldly and without care. What type of people do you think those are? If someone set up a drug spot on Ditmars with a blacked out window down the block from a church and a school, do you think people would care? It&#039;s not because people hate all people who do drugs, it&#039;s because the people who run illegal businesses tend to be not upstanding members of the community if you catch my drift. They&#039;re being obvious and in a storefront on a main drag in a family neighborhood. This isn&#039;t an industrial strip or a discrete location off the street level without a glaring neon sign. I think prostitution should be legal, but since it&#039;s not, it tends to attract people I mentioned above. If you think there&#039;s nothing going on there but a friendly hand job after a massage you&#039;re deluded. Since prostitution is illegal and unregulated, sex trafficking is rampant and the women who are there are often times there as part of a bargain that they made in order to gain illegal entry to our country. Many Asian massage parlors are staffed by women who have been essentially sold into prostitution by the people that have gotten them into the country. They pay off their debt through sexual services/ slavery and the guys that bring them in are often enforcing this through all the horrible ways you would expect. There&#039;s more to these places than a guy just wanting to get off. The approach of &quot;you don&#039;t like it, keep walking by&quot; has been used to ignore bad things happening for a long time. We should speak up if people are setting up shop like this in our neighborhood.

				I noticed that the Cherry Spa doesn&#039;t have the tv screen in the window anymore demonstrating massages.&nbsp; I wonder why they took it out of the window.&nbsp; I think this place is very suspicious.
