				(Cheers. Would anyone know more about this possible choice.<br /><br />&nbsp;http://www.malachymccourt.com/ &nbsp;)<br /><br />Author, activist Malachy McCourt to run for governor<br /><br />THE ASSOCIATED PRESS<br /><br />April 18, 2006<br /><br /><br />ALBANY -- Malachy McCourt, a writer, actor and brother of the author of<br />&quot;Angela&#39;s Ashes,&quot; said he plans to run for governor to end nuclear energy<br />programs and revoke the death penalty.<br /><br />&quot;It is quite clear in the Bible &#39;Thou Shalt Not Kill,&quot;&#39; McCourt, a raconteur<br />well-known in New York City progressive politics, said in a press release.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; McCourt, born in Brooklyn, is scheduled to announce his candidacy for the<br />Green Party nomination Sunday at a Long Island arts center. He was out of<br />the country Tuesday and didn&#39;t immediately respond to a request for comment.<br /><br />His book &quot;Bush Lies in State&quot; criticizes Republican President Bush as a &quot;dry<br />drunk&quot; who should be thrown from office.<br /><br />McCourt has established a Web site ( www.malachyforgovernor.com) and a<br />&quot;listen line&quot; at 646-213-1870.<br /><br />&quot;Don&#39;t waste your vote, give it to me,&quot; McCourt says on the listen line. &quot;We<br />will stand on principle while the others have to run, lest they be found<br />out.&quot;<br /><br />McCourt has appeared on public radio and numerous TV talk shows. His latest<br />of eight books is &quot;I Never Drink When I&#39;m Sober,&quot; and he writes a newspaper<br />column called &quot;Sez I to Myself.&quot; He also has acted in soap operas, and films<br />including &quot;The Molly Maguires,&quot; &quot;She&#39;s the One,&quot; &quot;The Devil&#39;s Own,&quot; and<br />&quot;Green Card&quot; and in the HBO prison series &quot;Oz.&quot;<br /><br />He is the brother of Frank McCourt, author of the best-seller &quot;Angela&#39;s<br />Ashes.&quot; The McCourts have collaborated on three books.<br /><br />&quot;If we can gather 15,000 signatures for Malachy McCourt, we earn the right<br />to continue to enroll as Green Party voters in New York state,&quot; said<br />McCourt&#39;s campaign manager, Maria Kuriloff, a Green activist from Nassau<br />County. &quot;If Malachy McCourt receives 50,000 votes for governor, the Green<br />Party will regain its automatic ballot status. We think Malachy can do it.&quot;<br /><br />In 1998, the Green Party ran Al Lewis, the labor activist and &quot;Grandpa&quot; from<br />the 1960s TV show &quot;The Munsters.&quot; He didn&#39;t defeat Pataki, but managed to<br />collect more than 52,000 votes. Lewis died in February.<br /><br />A Green Party spokesman didn&#39;t immediately respond to a request for comment<br />Tuesday.<br /><br />Candidates seeking the job being vacated by Republican Gov. George Pataki<br />this year are Democrats Eliot Spitzer and Tom Suozzi and Republicans John<br />Faso and Bill Weld.<br /><br />___<br /><br />On the Net:<br /><br />http://www.johnfaso2006.com<br /><br />http://www.tomsuozzi.com<br /><br />http://www.spitzer2006.com<br /><br />http://www.weldfornewyork.org/default.aspx<br /><br />www.malachyforgovernor.com<br /><br /><br />[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br />--- End forwarded message ---<br /><br /><br /><br />

				(While I can expect having another candidate to support, I like very much of what is discussed by Treichler below.) (Anyone planning to be in Albany May 20?)<br /><br /><br />http://www.legislativegazette.com/read_more.php?story=1271<br /><br /><br />Two Green Party candidates enter statewide races<br />&nbsp; <br />By THOMAS SANTOMARCO <br />Legislative Gazette Staff Writer<br />Mon, Apr 24, 2006<br /><br />It’s not easy being green these days. Or at least not as easy as it once was. <br /><br />Green Party candidate Stanley Aronowitz’s 2002 gubernatorial bid failed to garner the 50,000 votes necessary to maintain the party’s official ballot status, which was first achieved in 1998 by celebrity-activist Al “Grandpa” Lewis.<br /><br />Current Green Party candidates are faced with the daunting task of collecting the signatures of 15,000 registered voters in order to get them on the ballot this fall.<br /><br />Nevertheless, last week saw the entry of two Green Party candidates into statewide races, as Malachy McCourt tossed his hat into the ring that is the governor’s race, while Rachel Treichler declared her candidacy for attorney general.<br /><br />Treichler, a resident of Hammondsport in Steuben County, cited what she called “numerous impediments to voting” as one of the reasons for her entry into the race. <br /><br />She said having Election Day be a workday and not allowing citizens to register to vote on Election Day are deterrents to the process of electing public officials.<br /><br />Treichler is also calling for the use of hand-counted paper ballots, which she said is the safest and most cost-efficient method of tallying vote totals.<br /><br />Treichler, who ran in 2002 for the House of Representatives seat from the 29th District, also said she wants to see more public forums for candidates to debate issues with citizens present and wants to do away with current methods employed in drawing legislative districts. <br /><br />“We need elected officials who are not beholden to the two major parties and the interests they represent,” Treichler said.<br /><br />“We need to make sure that our rights to vote and our rights to free and fair elections are protected.” <br /><br />Meanwhile McCourt, a writer and actor, was expected to formally announce his candidacy at a Sunday Long Island news conference, but has created a “listen line” at 646-213-1870, where his recorded voice cheerfully greets callers with his campaign slogan, “Don’t waste your vote. Give it to me.”<br /><br />McCourt goes on to say, “We will stand in principle while the others have to run, lest they be found out,” before concluding “Green Party all the way.” <br /><br />McCourt, who has collaborated on three books with his brother Frank McCourt, of “Angela’s Ashes” fame, currently writes a newspaper column titled “Sez I to Myself” running in three Manhattan newspapers. <br /><br />Maria Kuriloff, McCourt’s campaign manager, said she is confident McCourt will easily make it on to the ballot this fall and thinks he will receive more votes than Lewis received in 1998.<br /><br />There are currently 36,141 registered Green Party voters in New York, according to the state board of elections.<br /><br />“There’s been an exciting reaction to this candidacy throughout the United States. We’ve even got support from Romania,” Kuriloff said. <br /><br />Jeff Peress is also seeking to be the Green nominee for governor this fall, but McCourt could have a leg up with his campaign treasurer being the wife of state Green Party Co-Chair Ian Wilder. <br /><br />“Mr. McCourt has a leg up,” Kuriloff said, “but it’s not because Mr.Wilder’s wife is his treasurer.”<br /><br />“Jeff Peress has no support.” <br /><br />The Green Party nominating convention is scheduled for May 20 in Albany. <br /><br />
