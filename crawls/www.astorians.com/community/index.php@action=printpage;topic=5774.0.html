				Faster Pussycat!!<br /><br />Is this a democracy?<br />What harm is the Last Poster Thread? Or is this an attempt to save them from themselves? Are they not grownups? Maybe that is a generous term, but I am doubtful that the results here would improve our maturity level.<br /><br />If Astorians is an Inane-free zone, I think it would not do this community as wide a &quot;service&quot;. (and we would be shunnnnnnnnn ed ahhhhhh)<br /><br />You could set an arbitray LPW deadline. But wont a new one rise like the Phoenix?<br /><br />Free Speech is a bitch. Hey, who pays for Astorians anyways? It feels free like oxygen, carbon monoxide, or craigslist.<br /><br />Hey, Charlottes Web will be playing soon !!&nbsp; &nbsp;:mrgreen:<br /><br />I am winning !!<br />

				If you&#039;re not liking the LPW thread, you could always just not read it!&nbsp; There are plenty of threads I see that I am not interested in when I click on &quot;Show Unread Posts&quot;.&nbsp; I do not read them.&nbsp; I just &quot;mark it read&quot;.&nbsp; It is simple.&nbsp; Some of us are enjoying the conversation in that thread and the friendly &quot;competitive&quot; posting.

				I agree with Aquaecny, why do you even care?&nbsp; A lot of the threads are completely inane, &quot;what&#039;s your favorite avatar?&quot;, &quot;how did you come up with your name?&quot;, etc?&nbsp; Obviously posting to a lot of these threads translate to having too much time on your hands.&nbsp; You even posting a poll on this says to me that you have way too much time on your hands.<br />
