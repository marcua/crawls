				I don&#039;t think someone lost the cat, I think the cat ate some or all of it&#039;s owner.&nbsp; All kidding aside. That looks like the best cat in the world to hang out on the couch with and watch movies or snooze.&nbsp;

				What the heck is wrong with people? Overfeeding your cat (or dog) is form of animal cruelty. Shame on the previous owner. I hope this cat finds a nice loving home with owners who will put her on a diet and get her health in check. She looks like a really sweet kitty.

				i actually emailed the shelter about adopting the Chunk!<br /><br />they said she MAY be amenable to being on a leash, which means she could be taken for walks!<br /><br />I would adopt her but the shelter is practically in Philadelphia (I dont have a car; perhaps she would need a helicopter)<br /><br />

One was fat - we called her the flounder when she sat a certain way - and the other was scrawny and hyper. The fat one was seriously obsessed with food, and she even licked people. She also was very inactive. We didn&#039;t overfeed her, she just wouldn&#039;t lose weight. She died of causes that didn&#039;t seem to be related to her weight. Some cats are just inclined to be fat, especially when they&#039;re not let outside. I mean, she didn&#039;t weigh 44 pounds, but maybe this cat comes from a naturally large breed and also has the inclination to gain weight.<br /><br />I just watched the video you posted. Has that lady on the right ever held a cat before? Geez.. I&#039;m surprised he didn&#039;t bite her. After that, I think he <em>must</em> have something like a thyroid problem that makes him very sluggish and slow.
