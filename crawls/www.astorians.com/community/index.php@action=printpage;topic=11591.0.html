				I believe the cop was 22 at the time.&nbsp; The whole thing goes back to how much we pay the cops.&nbsp; The whole things is really a shame.&nbsp; <br /><br />But the sad reality is that this has always been going on.&nbsp; It&#039;s just that video cameras weren&#039;t regularly available.&nbsp; We live in a police state, just steer clear of cops or you will get beaten/tasered/tackled, then get charged with felonious assault on a police officer.

				How do we know the cop wasn&#039;t defending himself? With all the political clout behind cyclists, the media was probably lying to us and that video is wrong. :-D<br /><br />I kid... what a jerk that cop is. I hope he loses his job. There really is no reason to tackle someone that violently who isn&#039;t somehow threatening you.

There were a few people trying to make the cross, and almost got nailed.&nbsp; I can understand bicyclists frustration with drivers, as I often bike myself, but when pedestrians try to cross a street at a legal intersection only to risk getting nailed by a hoard of asshole bikers, it defeats the purpose of their cause.<br /><br />But this example shows the other side so completely clear of what cops will do knowing it&#039;s their word against the person they decide to arrest.&nbsp; This biker was just lucky there was a person videotaping, otherwise, he&#039;d be up s___ creek with legal problems and the cop would get off squeaky clean.

				You know we cork intersections for the Tour de Queens, Tour de Brooklyn and the safety pack for the Tour de Bronx.&nbsp; It&#039;s actually the safest and fastest way to get a group of cyclists through a light quickly instead of forcing them to be strung out between traffic and trying to regroup while drivers try to get around them.&nbsp; Would you rather have 1 group of cyclists to get past or 5 individual smaller groups.&nbsp; The major difference between our rides and CM is that we get the parade permits and the cops assist us in corking.<br /><br />If you&#039;re curious about how Critical Mass goes down in Brooklyn check out this video. (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V04T-mtuUg8)&nbsp; It&#039;s a lot different.&nbsp; And here&#039;s some food for thought, when car traffic gets backed up at the bridges the traffic cops often &quot;cork&quot; the pedestrians to allow car traffic through.&nbsp; They could easily do the same thing for CM Manhattan.&nbsp; In fact I personally think nothing would take the wind out of Critical Mass Manhattan than cooperation from the cops, half of the people who are there just to be &quot;counter culture&quot; would stop coming I think.<br /><br />And I personally don&#039;t think much of Critical Mass.

I think that if cops got paid more, there would be people actually competing for the jobs instead of the force just taking what they can get. The sad fact is that these days, because the pay is so low, the police force just takes anyone willing to do the job rather than selecting the people who would be good candidates. <br />

But those on bikes need to follow traffic laws, too.&nbsp; It&#039;s a two way street.&nbsp; I know this argument has been made before in a thread about waterfront parking, but the attitude of some (I stress some, not all!) bikers seems to be that since they are using a green method of transportation, they should be allowed to disregard the law, and hold motorists in contempt.&nbsp; I read a posting on some other board that put it very well - some Critical Massers have just as much of a sense of entitlement as Hummer drivers, but with more of a sense of self righteousness.

In Boston, on the first Friday of every month, CM meets downtown and rides up over the river to Cambridge and Sommerville. Cars knew it would happen and bikers were respectful and the sight of forty or fifty bikers make the residents happy. We never had any violence, arrests or anything like that. The point of doing it in Boston was to increase awareness of cyclists on the road. <br /><br />When I first came to NYC, I was looking forward to doing the CM here and getting to know people. I tried to go to one and was overwhelmed by how impolitely, aggressively and dangerously these bikers rode. They didn&#039;t have respect for the other cyclists riding with them, let alone for pedestrians or motorists.

Critical Mass is different in each city it exists in. No other CM that I&#039;ve been to is violent and disruptive the way NYC&#039;s is. When a group of &quot;activists&quot; has a reputation for being violent, it&#039;s understandable that the police would react differently to them than they would to a group known as being peaceful.

It&#039;s not that they shouldn&#039;t *try*, but it is an impossible task and, I think, the only thing you can do or ask anyone else to do is use the best judgment available to them at the time and for us all to remember that ignorance of a law is not an excuse for violating it.

While I can appreciate Para&#039;s view that cops are put in a tough position when there is a violent group that may threaten them or their fellow officers, I don&#039;t think that was anywhere near the case here. From what I&#039;ve seen, yes, CM tends to be rude, disrespectful to cops and disruptive, but that does not give an officer license to become violent without a direct threat. I didn&#039;t see anything that was directly endangering the officers or other citizens in this particular instance. <br /><br />And to whomever said it before, great question, how often does this sort of thing happen? Are cops falsifying police reports to cover their backs and get the collar more often than we think?

While I can appreciate Para&#039;s view that cops are put in a tough position when there is a violent group that may threaten them or their fellow officers, I don&#039;t think that was anywhere near the case here. From what I&#039;ve seen, yes, CM tends to be rude, disrespectful to cops and disruptive, but that does not give an officer license to become violent without a direct threat. I didn&#039;t see anything that was directly endangering the officers or other citizens in this particular instance. <br /><br />And to whomever said it before, great question, how often does this sort of thing happen? Are cops falsifying police reports to cover their backs and get the collar more often than we think?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I said it.&nbsp; And yes.&nbsp; Cops lie.&nbsp; They lie to protect themselves, they lie to protect each other and they lie to make more money.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t already know this, you need to wake up.&nbsp; Or just stay in your dream state, whatever.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, I agree with how you feel about Frappe&#039;s comments.&nbsp; he said it perfectly.&nbsp; The cyclist did nothing to induce an elbow to his face.&nbsp; If he was so dangerous, why wasn&#039;t the other cop helping out?

				Hey, I am no fan of Critcal Mass--the NYC branch seems to be full of obnoxious, aggressive cyclists who take great glee in intimidating pedestrians and blocking traffic.<br /><br />Having said that, CM is NOT the issue here. &nbsp;The issue here is that a cop attacked a cyclist who was not doing anything illegal, got caught on tape doing it, and also got caught lying about it. &nbsp;<br /><br />I hope that this bad cop gets an all-expenses-paid weekend in The Tombs, at minimum, as partial reward for his misdeeds (followed by a pretty, frameable, pink slip and a civil-action lawsuit by the guy he attacked that bankrupts him).<br /><br />

I dont&#039; know enough about that to speak to it. <br /><br />However, I think the practical approach would be to firmly punish any cops who abuse their power and to actively keep an eye out for that kind of activity, realizing that the temptation to lie to protect your job or your buddies, to take a bribe, etc etc, is hard to resist for a lot of people. We can&#039;t expect cops to act differently from the average human being. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Now I can appreciate that, and I don&#039;t think anyone can expect that cops won&#039;t give in to temptation to abuse their power.

Our expectations are the same for every day people- I expect people will screw up and break the law, but I sure am pissed when they do it. <br />

				I have watched that video over and over. If you look at the cops partner he is walking a few steps behind him and didn&#039;t look surprised at his partners action. The video really has one side to it. It doesn&#039;t show what the cyclist was doing before he &quot;met&quot; with the cop. Cops really don&#039;t have powers. Superman does. Cops enforce the laws that you and I vote for, so to speak. Not many people like cops because not many people like authority. I know there are a few bad apples out there but out of 35,000 come on! If anyone remembers what it was like in the 80&#039;s and early 90&#039;s they would appreciate seeing cops on the street. I am not a fan of the &quot;new breed&quot;. It seems that you can take the exam in July and be in the academy in the following Jan. Seems more like a whim than a career choice. I was told that it used to take years for a background check. This new department must be hard to police itself considering that you cant do a background check on someone from a distant country. Just my opinion. I know I kind of went off the topic but believe half of what you see and nothing that you hear. There are two sides to this story I am sure. I don&#039;t think any cop would do that for no reason with such a huge audience. Sorry so long.

When it comes down to his word against mine, a court will always believe a police officer.

And yes, there is incentive for a cop making $25,000 starting salary to get arrests so he can get promoted and make a fairly decent salary. <br /><br />

				Casicua and Jiggs,<br />&nbsp;You guys just don&#039;t get it. COPS DO NOT GET RAISES OR PROMOTIONS OR ANY &quot;POINTS&quot; FOR MAKING ARRESTS. A cops main concern is to come home every night. There is no us verses them on either side of the fence. There isn&#039;t a way for cops to go all out to get people prosecuted. It is up to the DA&#039;s office and they are not on the cops side. Just read the papers. Try going to the community board and do a ride along with the precinct cops. It is a real eye opener. I know of a few people on this board that did it. And why don&#039;t you test it out with a friend and grab his arm while he is riding a bicycle past you. Maybe the cop should have used a pillow.<br /><br />&nbsp;These people took to the streets without permits and created chaos. There are also people that antagonize the police. It is not a joke. If you want a bicycle parade apply for a permit like anybody else that assembles lawfully. Rules are set so things like this don&#039;t happen. Bicyclists are mandated to follow the rules of the road which are defined as a privilege by NYS, not a right.

				I&#039;m actually agreeing with Jiggs for once.<br />Look at anyone who has a job. If you do better at your job, it equals promotions. If you are a cop and you get more arrests that affects your promotion. It&#039;s a universal fact that producing better results at your job means promotions. <br />A cops main concern is not to get home every night, it is to earn a paycheck. I don&#039;t see any cops working for free. I understand a cop&#039;s job is difficult, I don&#039;t envy them one bit. The fact is that they have to play by the rules. They have restrictions and rules in place for a reason. I don&#039;t agree with what critical mass has become, but it does not justify the officer&#039;s actions. I despise thieves and burglars, but that would not give a cop a right to abuse his authority and shoot one of them in cold blood- it&#039;s an extreme example, but same principle. Cops do not have wanton license to do whatever it takes to get convictions. <br /><br />Back to the original post, can you explain to me why there is such a vast difference between what the officer wrote on the report (On OFFICIAL record) and what was caught on tape?<br />

				&nbsp;I will have to disagree with you and Jiggs. Just read the City Charter. Promotions are earned through competitive promotional exams. Disagree all that you want. The only other way to get promoted is through an investigative route which leads to detective. Before you make statements get the facts.<br /><br />&nbsp;A cops main concern and only concern at work is to come home. P.O. Timoshenko was killed in the line of duty and the following Friday his paycheck was cut. He definitely earned it but is not here to collect it. I am not looking for you to sympathize with the police but to listen with both ears. There are some bad cops out there I can&#039;t deny it. But there are bad seeds in every profession. <br /><br />&nbsp;As for the original post. There is an ongoing investigation.<br />

				Police promotions, and better assignments, are gotten by being what they call &quot;An active cop.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; They look at arrest numbers, and go for quantity over quality.&nbsp; I have&nbsp; a former friend who is a cop now (Once he got into it he became impossible to hang out with)&nbsp; &nbsp; He told me that he was told that if he wanted to get onto certain squads, or make detective, boost arrest record.&nbsp; &nbsp; One cop in his pricient got promoted by arresting anyone for anything---if he could write a&nbsp; ticket, he would not. He&#039;d find reason to get person to station and fingerprinted.&nbsp; &nbsp;He got promotion. My friend heard this, and got into that attitude.<br /><br />I also heard two cops discussing how to get a promotion, and one advised other that they were looking for active cops, and arrests figures counted.&nbsp; Don&#039;t go by what city charter says, the department sure doesn&#039;t.&nbsp; &nbsp;This is nothing new by the way, it&#039;s been going on since at least as far back as 1980&#039;s.&nbsp;

				Both of them didn&#039;t tumble down; the cop was standing the entire time. <br /><br />The cop didn&#039;t turn around &#039;til the very last second, and the cyclist steered around him. Sometimes pedestrians get startled when they see a biker coming their way, but the biker is paying attention and trying to see which way the pedestrian is moving so he/she can steer accordingly. That&#039;s what I do.
