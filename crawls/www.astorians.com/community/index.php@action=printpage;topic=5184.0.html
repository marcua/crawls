				decided to take a stick and throw it into traffic and ran this morning at the lovely hour of 6:45.&nbsp; :x&nbsp; No damage done but I don&#39;t think he gets how incredibly dangerous that is.&nbsp; Anyone know any details of a similar situation where kids threw objects into traffic?&nbsp; i want to find some news articles for him to read and report on as he sits in the office all day.&nbsp;

				Katlu,<br /><br />If you google &#39;overpass&#39; and &#39;rock&#39; you will find a bunch of sad news stories about individuals being killed or seriously wounded because of some kid or kids throwing rocks and other items onto the highway.&nbsp; <br /><br />What&#39;s frightening in your account is that the child didn&#39;t seem to realize that he did anything wrong!!&nbsp; How old is he?&nbsp; Where are his parent(s)?&nbsp; Have they been notified? <br /><br />Good luck with this situation!&nbsp; I hope that he learns his lesson so none of us become his victim later!&nbsp; <br /><br />

				There are frequently large, sharp icicles hanging off the pedestrian/subway overpass over Astoria Blvd/GCP. They&#39;re at about head level, and in an absentminded &quot;ooh, icicles!&quot; moment walking home I nearly knocked one off once. Fortunately, before I did, I realized that it would have fallen about 50 feet into traffic, and stopped myself. But am surprised not to have heard of any accidents as the result of icicles (or frozen turkeys) falling or being thrown off that overpass... There&#39;s no fence or anything as I would normally expect on an overpass like that.

				Frappe, Astoria Luv, and Harlan,<br /><br />I appreciate your help and printed out many articles for him to read.&nbsp; Also, his mother finally got the message and came.&nbsp; She made him carry the stick that he threw into the traffic,&nbsp; calling it his best friend.&nbsp; I don&#39;t think he will risk that again. By the time I was through with him and every staff member, he had understanding about how dangerous that was. <br /><br />&nbsp;Man, I was so heated this morning!!!&nbsp; It was like watching a train wreck about to happen.&nbsp; &nbsp;Again thanks! <br /><br />And Harlan, I can see myself doing the same thing!!&nbsp; glad you thought before you grabbed one.
