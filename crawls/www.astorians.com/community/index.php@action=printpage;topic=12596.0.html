				(I tried searching for this, but only found really old threads)<br /><br />What&#039;s the average utilities you pay per month and for what kind of space? I have a 3 bedroom and our bill for Sept was $150.&nbsp; It was the highest since we moved there--even higher than summer when we had fans on all the time. Which lead me to question whether rates have gone up? And also are we on par with what the average household uses? I feel we aren&#039;t and that my roommates have wasteful habits with energy....like leaving the tv on 24 hrs for the dog and forgetting to turn lights off when they leave. So naturally our bill will be higher, but I am just curious what I might be paying if I wasn&#039;t paying for a dog to watch Spongebob all day.<br /><br />

				Hello,<br /><br />I recall that we discussed the increase in utility bills from Con Ed.&nbsp; I found this thread that might be helpful.<br /><br />http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=11714.0<br /><br />Personally, my bill was pretty high, compared to last year, but it was manageable.&nbsp;

				Hell, my dogs won&#039;t even watch SpongeBob anymore. It must be boring. Now they watch It&#039;s Me or the Dog or one of their many DVDs.<br /><br />$150 for a three bedroom apartment is kinda cheap. Perhaps you should call and have ConEd come do a house survey so you can get it increased and pay like the rest of us!

				<br />I have a one bedroom and pay between $55 - $65 a month in the winter, and $70 - $100 in the summer (because of the AC).<br /><br />This is just for gas and electric, and I hardly ever use my gas stove.<br /><br />I can def recommend the energy saving fluorescent bulbs. I&#039;ve noticed a small savings since getting them.

				We just paid $115 this past month for a two-bedroom. Everything is on surge protectors for us too, except we don&#039;t turn off the one for the TV in the living room - then it wouldn&#039;t be worth paying for the DVR!&nbsp; :lol: Of course, the rates for electricity got cut in half from the month before that which helps!

				Friends,<br />&nbsp; I pay US$123.00 a month to Con Ed on a level billing plan, which I have always thought was a bit high for these three rooms in a pre-war building.&nbsp; However, I suspect that I&#039;m still somehow connected to the building as a whole and that is part of the problem.<br />&nbsp; During the Black Out, I completely, lost power to two of my three rooms (the front two), but had still had power to the light in my kitchen, but not to my refrigerator. This, would suggest to me, that I&#039;m still not independent of the building even though the building was extensively rewired to give every apartment their own &quot;breaker box&quot;.<br />&nbsp; Honestly, I don&#039;t turn off my power strips, cable box, etc.&nbsp; So, this could be a problem along with my ancient refrigerator, that I know sucks up electricity.<br /><br />-=:Astoristani:=-
