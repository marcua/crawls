				<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;" class="bbc_font"><span style="font-size: medium;" class="bbc_size">We have arranged with our current tenants to show the apartment on Sunday August 21st between 1:00 and 5:00. Please respond to this posting and we will call you to arrange a viewing.General information (positive and negative): It is <span class="bbc_u">two levels</span> the third and fourth floor. (My wife, my son and I live on the first two levels). There is a large stacked washer/dryer in the apartment. The stairwells are narrow - so you can forget about bringing in wide furniture. The heat is baseboard water heated by natural gas. You pay for your own gas and electric. We pay water. We believe in energy efficiency - the building has new exterior insulation and new double paned windows. This is a no-smoking building. Cats are just great with us - we have two ourselves (or do they have us?). The building is 100+ years old and we&#039;ve been in the process of renovating for 10+ years. The area is somewhat industrial and looks a bit rough on the edges, but we&#039;re working on that as good neighbors, and as founding members of the Long Island City Alliance. Over the course of the last two years we have re-imagined our street, and with the assistance of more than 60 internationally recognized graffiti muralists (The Welling Court Mural Project) the street is now a street level art gallery. There&#039;s no other way to say it: Welling Court is an amazing place! This is safe area; never an incident. On time rent is important to us. We expect kindness and consideration from those we rent to, and in return we make every attempt to be the greatest landlords on the planet.(Perhaps we&#039;re not always successful but we do try, and you&#039;re welcome to ask anyone who has ever lived here:-) It&#039;s a 10 min. walk from the house to the N or Q train, and there are 2 bus stops within a one minute walk.<br />Please include your phone number in your response and Georgina or I (Jon) will give you a call so that we can set up a time that won&#039;t have you milling through the place with a bunch of other people. - Fair is fair:-)<br />More info: The apartment is currently rented and will not be available until Oct 1. We have been living in this neighborhood for 11 years and have never had any problems with safety or security. The bedrooms are attic rooms with slanted ceilings and are quite large. We do not provide air conditioners but tenants are welcome to put in window units. The kitchen/dining area faces the south and gets terrific light. There is a ceiling fan in that room and there are original parquet floors. The stove is gas. There is a large refrigerator. If I think of anything else I will indeed add it in...<br />One further note: People either love this space, or not. There are no in betweens. In ten years there have been only four renters - obviously, they all loved it. <br /><br />Ellismail@gmail.com<br /></span></span><br /><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;" class="bbc_font">[/size]<span style="font-size: medium;" class="bbc_size">11-51 Welling Court</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;" class="bbc_font">[/size]</span>

				Sounds great.&nbsp; Do you have any photos to show what the rooms look like and maybe a link to a google map to show where the area is?&nbsp; Thanks.

				Although, I&#039;m not in the market for a new apartment, just wanted to say that your place sounds really nice! Good luck in your tenant search. :)
