				What is your favorite place to eat with a healthy or at least somewhat healthy menu? Somewhere with a nice salad or fish entree. for example (but not limited to).... BUT preferably a sit-down restaurant. So, some place other than Soho where I can order a &quot;make-your-own-salad&quot; to be delivered to my apartment at any time.&nbsp; :lol:<br /><br />

				Mundo is pretty healthy. Lots of grains and vegetables.<br /><br />Sushi is pretty healthy, but only if you skip the fancy rolls. Most of them are covered in heavy mayonnaise-based sauces, or have deep-fried components. <br /><br />Indian food at Seva can be relatively healthy, especially if you get vegetarian dishes. The sauces have lots of yogurt, but are otherwise very low in fat. And turmeric may reduce the incidence of Alzheimer&#039;s disease.

				Taverna Kyclades has a great selection of grilled fish. I like their branzino (whole fish, deboned). You can opt for a healthy side such horta (dandelion greens) or beets. Start off with a greek salad and it will be a healthy meal. Go easy on the feta and bread though.<br /><br />Really any greek place will have these offerings.

				My idea of &quot;healthy&quot; may be a bit unorthodox.<br /><br />Il Bambino has a number of healthful things - some vegetable salads, and soup in the wintertime.&nbsp; The crostini are a nice alternative to the panini, too.&nbsp; Less simple carbs, but the bread is fantastic.&nbsp; I like the goat cheese with rosemary oil or honey.<br /><br />I consider a burger at Sparrow to be just fine.&nbsp; Grass fed beef, and you can get a salad in place of the fries.<br /><br />Soho on 31st Street is a good option.&nbsp; Their turkey bacon is very tasty and I enjoy their whole wheat pancakes.&nbsp; Nice juices, too.<br /><br />Mundo is a good idea, too.&nbsp; The Red Sonja is particularly yummy.<br /><br />Fresh Start on 23rd Ave has a lot of prepared foods, too.
