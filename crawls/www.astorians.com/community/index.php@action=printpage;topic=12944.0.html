				I can&#039;t say I&#039;m surprised, but I can say I am saddened. Not that I was any help in keeping it open - by the time its final incarnation rolled around, I didn&#039;t have the money nor the local buddies to go there. Alas, our hipster wine bar is no more.&nbsp; :-( Seeing as that they&#039;ve had some success in Brooklyn, I hope the guys don&#039;t stop considering Astoria in their business endeavors.

				Has it even been around for two years? I know the economy is crap now, but i&#039;m not sure taht is what is at fault for Oleput...were they even able to establish a client base with the constant openings and closings? I tried going there several times, but so many times went and found a closed place, that it was no longer in my plans anymore. sorry its closing, but for all intents and purposes, it feels like its been closed since its been open, so a little hard to miss.

				Hmmm, we&#039;ve got more than enough sushi places, bistros, cheap coffee, expensive coffee, bodegas and delis in that area. Maybe The Little Soap Shop could move in there? Or Tony&#039;s Bikes?

				Wow, that sucks about Freezepeach. It&#039;s another place I didn&#039;t go to very often, but that place is how I found this board and it inspired me to get into making my own tea blends. I hope Waltz is okay. Maybe I should get those open mics in more frequently.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=12944.msg157722#msg157722">Quote from: Christine on November 08, 2008, 01:21:22 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Maybe Freezepeach could open in the old Oleput spot, which is more visible than where they are currently?

It&#039;s doubtful that they could afford any place on Ditmars proper. I wonder what the rents are like in those old real estate offices east of 33rd street that are sitting empty, and that old Sunshine produce place that has also been empty for a few months at this point. The rents really will have to come down at some point. I don&#039;t get these landlords that think they should charge Manhattan prices for Astoria businesses. Assholes.<br /><br />My roommates and I, and the guys upstairs, are being booted out of our apartments in February. The owner&#039;s plan is to renovate the hell out of the building (which will take a few months) and then charge several hundred more per month for the apartments. The building is in real need of renovation, but the huge rent jump doesn&#039;t sound to me like a practical decision. We&#039;re hoping Astoria rents go down a little bit by the time we have to move, because we don&#039;t want to leave the area.

				I was thinking more about this tonight, and passed by the SoupMan/ice cream place. Bingo! A soup and ice cream place! Two things we currently don&#039;t have but could use in that area. Maybe ice cream in the summer and soup in the winter?<br /><br />Personally, I could live without the ice cream place, but would prefer another branch of Pita Hot right there. Falafel is one of the few things you can&#039;t find within ten feet of there. <br /><br />Or a federally-subsidized cat shelter. Not enough room for dogs (but maybe they could carry dog adoption info.) Might be too small for even cats, come to think of it, but I&#039;d rather see an adoption center in every major shopping area than a freakin&#039; pet shop like on Steinway. Maybe when Obama&#039;s in office and puts the war to an immediate halt, we&#039;ll have quadrillions of dollars for programs like animal welfare, and mandate at least one retail space per square mile toward animal adoption.<br /><br />How about a Smoothie King? Just the right size. They could share the space with Auntie Anne&#039;s pretzels. Top Tomato could provide all the fresh produce for truly healthy smoothies. A decadent pretzel would be a nice pairing with a health smoothie&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br />

				&nbsp; oleput closed because they are never consistantly open.&nbsp; its not the kind of business you stoll into because you see it open from across the street, its a place you think in your head while you&#039;re at home, &quot;hey, ill go sit at oleput with my laptop and sip an expensive coffee.&quot;&nbsp; if it&#039;s never consistantly open, people will usually think, &quot;they&#039;re probably closed, so i&#039;m not wasting my time by walking over to check and they are most likely closed.&quot;&nbsp; that and the fact of the competition in the immediate area.&nbsp; theres starbucks and freezepeach all within a few seconds walk from oleput.&nbsp; plus three &quot;internet cafes&quot; where you don&#039;t have to spend so much to lounge and use the interwebz (copycom, cybercity, ditmars train station).<br />&nbsp; it is definately not because &quot;high rents squeeze out independent business&quot;&nbsp; because ditmars consisits mostly of independents who been there for years, one even just expanded into the storefront next to it (the womens accessory store next to starbucks).

As for the accessory store he also owns the building and he squeezed the Jewelry store out so he can expand. Also for the people who shop in the accessory store he just opened another location on Steinway next to Victoria&#039;s secret and the store is beautiful<br />

				My husband and I actually really liked Oleput, and we&#039;re really disappointed that it closed.&nbsp; It was actually our favorite place in the &#039;hood to grab a drink.&nbsp; Their wine menu was consistently good, and we loved the relaxed atmosphere.&nbsp; Admittedly, we didn&#039;t go there enough to keep it open, and I&#039;ll tell you why.&nbsp; It was a little pricey...more than we could afford as a regular thing.&nbsp; But actually less pricey than we find Crescent &amp; Vine.&nbsp; The inconsistent hours did bug us a bit, too.&nbsp; If we were picking a place to meet people, we wouldn&#039;t choose it, because it wasn&#039;t a sure thing that it&#039;d be open.&nbsp; Just wanted to add my two cents, because I&#039;m genuinely disappointed that it&#039;s gone.
