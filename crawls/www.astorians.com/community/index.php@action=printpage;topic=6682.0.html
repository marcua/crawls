				Greetings,<br /><br />As your browsing Astorians you may notice an ad will appear from time to time at the top of the page. I&#039;m giving this a trial run to see how it affects site performance, and to see if the ads are relevant for the content of the board. If you have feedback, please post it here.<br /><br />If you&#039;re a supporter (http://www.astorians.com/index.php?action=profile;sa=subscriptions) of the board, you won&#039;t see the ads BTW.

				Bravo. <br /><br />Any way Astorians can provide financial relief to the administrators of this board, I will support. Until this site is self-supporting we should all make a small annual donation to keep it going. People will always be coming and going from the board, but the board is always here. It provides answers to questions; friendships; and has become an important resource to the community-at-large. <br /><br />At the bottom of each page is a <strong>Become a Supporter</strong> (http://www.astorians.com/index.php?action=profile;sa=subscriptions) link. Please click it and donate. Do it now before you forget.

				i think that&#039;s an unfair stance.<br />it&#039;s one thing to have them unobtruseively in the top corner as was originally intended. to have them in the middle of the threads in my opinion is very distracting and takes away from the flow of the thread.<br />if i want to and can donate i will. i don&#039;t think i or anyone should be forced to in such a manner. i don&#039;t have the disposable income to make any sort of donation. if i did i would have done so by now. along with donations to about 5 other organizations i used to donate to but can no longer due to financial constraints. <br /><br />i&#039;m all for advertisements in the upper corner, but am totally against them being shoved within threads. especially ones that have nothing to do with astoria or queens at all.

				The ads in the middle of the threads are fine.&nbsp; I don&#039;t find them obtrusive or any worse then an overly long cut and paste.<br /><br />As I see it, Astorians.com is a wonderful community tool which I, and I&#039;d comfortably suspect, most users, pay nothing for.&nbsp; Therefore, I am in favor of any measure, which gives it financial support.&nbsp; This includes the mid-thread ads.

				The problem is that without the advertising, Merm is out the funds to keep the board up and going.&nbsp; I wish more folks would become supporters of the board and chip in to help cover the costs, but as that has not taken place, I think the advertising works best as it helps bring in revenue and is pretty minimally intrusive.&nbsp;

				Hi guys,<br /><br />Sorry if some of you find the ads to be annoying - the thing is that the ads don&#039;t work if they are in the upper right hand corner of the screen for the very reason pointed out - they are difficult to see. Ads are only worth while if occasionally someone finds something interesting about them and visits the sponsor site.<br /><br />That being said I&#039;m sensitive to the opinions and preferences of all members, but it&#039;s an illusion these days that running an internet site is free - it takes a lot of work, and the more the site grows, the more it costs in hosting and maintenance.<br /><br />I don&#039;t really feel that the ads are being &quot;forced&quot; on anyone though - the internet (and television, and radio) are all paid for by advertising - even our subway rides are partially paid for by advertising. That being said, I do like the model of giving people an option to disable the ads if they choose, and this is why the ads don&#039;t display for supporters. You can become a supporter by contributing <strong><em>any</em></strong> amount, and that is good for one full year.<br /><br />I&#039;m still trying to find the right balance needed to make this thing self-sustaining - so over the next few days/weeks you may see less, more, or different ads or ideas as I try and figure that out. I do appreciate the feedback, and also the support of everyone who uses the board. Whether that&#039;s by tolerating some advertising, or supporting the site directly.

				I have mixed feelings about the ads. The thing is, I am happy to support the board as I think it&#039;s a valuable tool for the community and I don&#039;t mind giving a few dollars to it. However, as someone who did read the board but maybe wasn&#039;t terribly thorough about it, I didn&#039;t know there was a simple donation thing to become a member or whatever until I started getting ads shoved in my face in the middle of threads. That said, I might&#039;ve donated before if it was made clearer that this was an option, without having to put these ads in place.<br /><br />merm, maybe the board would be better off if there were just an obvious line of text at the top of the screen that said something like &quot;Support Astorians.com and get more features&quot; or something, and donating would get rid of that line at the top of the screen (along with the other benefits). That and the <em>occasional</em> ad at the top of the screen, which would also go away upon donating, seems like it would be better. <br /><br />While the mid-thread ads did get me to donate simply because I never thought of it before, I think they do take away from the look and feel of the board, and I don&#039;t think people should have to put up with that if they don&#039;t give money to the site. Realistically, how many people actually click on those things, especially when they&#039;re not even specifically relevant to Astoria or Queens? The ads are ugly and obtrusive, and I can definitely identify with the people who don&#039;t like them while they&#039;re reading the board at work. Furthermore, some people don&#039;t like logging in at work, so they&#039;ll have these ads in the middle of threads whether they donated or not. This might actually drive some people away, and I don&#039;t think that&#039;s what you are going for.

The default donation is $12/year ($1/mo), but some people choose to donate more, or less depending on what they feel comfortable with. Any amount is fine, and I&#039;m grateful to those who choose to support the board this way.<br /><br />That being said, if people would rather not donate directly they are in effect supporting the board by tolerating the ads and visiting a sponsor site if they see something that interests them.

				I just contributed based on merm&#039;s post regarding cost and time and because to me, it was the right thing to do.

				Hey Luv, :)<br /><br />Thanks so much for your kind remarks!<br /><br />Also, wasabisam made a little Astorians supporter &quot;badge&quot; that stands out a little more than just the star that was there before. This had been suggested to me by a few members and I think she did a great job on it.

				The tags remind me of the little gold placks you see in churches so people can see who donated what. <br /><br />I might as well negative nod myself to get the lynching started for this comment.

When people get into flame wars, you know it&#039;s bad when people start demeaning others&#039; opinions because they don&#039;t have TotalFark accounts.&nbsp; :roll:<br /><br />I feel like adding that aside from some people not being financially comfortable enough for them to be able to justify giving money to a message board, some people hate paypal and some people just hate using their credit cards online, and some people simply do not feel vested enough in the board to want to give money to it. I think these are all fair reasons for not giving money. I really, truly do not think anyone should be made to feel like less of a board member or simply guilty if they choose not to donate.

But your argument is really just a hypothetical one because nobody around here is petty and immature enough to think less of anyone else because they didn&#039;t donate to the board. When or if this happens we can all deal with it as a group and let people know that we don&#039;t appreciate that in our community.<br /><br />To your other point about people not feeling comfortable with PayPal, or using a credit card online, etc I&#039;ll just say they are not required to do any of those things. The board doesn&#039;t require payment for membership as membership is free - they can continue to use and benefit from the board in the same ways as those who donate.<br /><br />I think the bar for accessibility is set pretty low here since people can contribute <em>any</em> amount if they&#039;d like to remove the ads, they can also purchase a T-Shirt, or if someone is really against using a credit card I&#039;d be happy to send them my mailing address so they can send a check. If they are against sending money at all I&#039;d be happy to arrange some kind of trade, or some individualized solution. I&#039;m very open to new ideas.<br /><br />BTW, if there was a huge influx of money I&#039;d happily ditch the ads. Do you have some extra sitting around by chance essen? :)

What the heck? I was talking about if many people started giving the standard amount or more, which it seems a lot of people are now doing. I thought the ads were put in because not a lot of people were paying, so I was wondering if the board ended up being sufficiently member-supported if you&#039;d take the ads down. Not sure how that warrants the snarky response. and I&#039;m not even sure why I&#039;m bothering to say anything about it at this point as I&#039;ve made my point and if people don&#039;t get it or are choosing to mock me about it, whatever. I&#039;m sorry, but placing ads in the middle of threads isn&#039;t the only way to make money for the board and I don&#039;t believe it is the best way in regards to the community we have here. If you disagree and you think making the board look this is great, fine. I&#039;m done with this.

				I don&#039;t think merm meant to come across that way.<br /><br />I have hesitated to jump into this conversation because I&#039;ve thought merm should be the main person to address this, but because I also consider this something I devote time, money, and energy to I&#039;ll go ahead.<br /><br />Typically I personally don&#039;t like advertising that infringes upon a site visitor&#039;s experience. Some websites that use advertising become &quot;cheapened&quot;, if you will, and it sounds like that is how a few people feel about it here. I would normally tend to agree, but being in the situation that I am (web/graphic guru, contributor of personal funds on a monthly basis for the entire existence of Astorians.com/.net, etc., etc.), I have to admit my perspective is a bit biased and relative.<br /><br />While neither merm nor I spend a tremendous amount of time posting new topics or posts we do spend a significant amount of time maintaining the website and trying to make it better. Being the web people that we are we&#039;re always trying to figure out how to make Astorians.com better. We&#039;re asking ourselves &quot;Does this work? Will people like it? Is it intuitive?&quot; In order for the site to grow and to benefit a larger and larger group of people we have to spend more and more time working on it - and with increased traffic, there is an increase cost when it comes to server load/space.<br /><br />Astorians.com would not be what it is without the continued participation from regular Astorians, but because there is an increase in traffic as well as an increase in the amount of time it takes to manage it, we do feel that we need to figure out ways to help with those types of costs. By no means is advertising going to make us a lot of money, but it will help to defray some of the costs. We also really appreciate the people who have donated money, either via direct donations or via the online store. Truly! Your contributions not only help us out financially while we try to manage this great big wonderful site, but they also help remind us that there is a great community out there that want to help us.<br /><br />You&#039;re absolutely right - advertising is not the only way to get support, and I&#039;ll agree that it isn&#039;t ideal to the user&#039;s experience, but as merm has pointed out people are not forced to donate. I&#039;ll also point out that we&#039;re still playing around with ideas. Being in the web industry (not just here - my day job as well), I will say that things are constantly changing. Even advertising on the web is changing. Everything online is always in flux, so Astorians will likely continue to change and evolve as time goes on.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t mean to make this so long, but my main point(s) here is that Astorians.com = really great website, and merm/wasabisam = really dedicated to seeing what works best for everybody involved.
