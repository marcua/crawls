				I like the story about his secret plan to raise taxes on the rich, only to have the taxes magically expire right before he ran for re-election so he could claim he lowered taxes. I tell you, Governor Paterson impresses me more every day.

				By the way, my dream SNL skit at this point is one where Fred Armisen plays Paterson, Obama, and Bobby Jindal all at the same time. (Obviously it would have to be a digital short or something.) I don&#039;t know what they would all do, but I know it would be great.

I was shocked when that judge agreed with Cuomo that the names of Merrill Lynch bonus recipients should be released, even after Cuomo wouldn&#039;t guarantee confidentiality.

There are many to blame for our current financial mess, vis-a-vis housing. But this is the guys who started the ball rolling. His proclamation that, sure there will be more loans defaulted on, is the absolute pinnacle of arrogance. Yet he has never, to my knowledge, come out and say that maybe, just maybe that was a bad idea. And I also feel that getting a job as HUD director because your daddy was viewed as heavy player in Democratic politics just shows the underlying rot in politics today.<br />There are a few people who have done their job so terribly, that they really need to find another line of work. He is one of them. And amazingly, people of this state will support him.&nbsp; :cry:
