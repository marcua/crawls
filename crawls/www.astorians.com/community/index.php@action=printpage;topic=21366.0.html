				My husband and I had an extremely difficult time finding a 2 bedroom pre-war in Astoria.&nbsp; We are admittedly rather picky.&nbsp; We literally registered at every office in Astoria.&nbsp; We saw over 40 units.. We also met some sleezy realtors.&nbsp; I was told things like &quot;Every apartment in NYC has roaches.&quot;&nbsp; <br />I work around the corner from Astoria Apartments and after stopping in pretty frequently we found our new home.&nbsp; And, even before we found the right apartment for us, they were the first office to only show us decent apartments.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure that the other folks hadn&#039;t even seen half of the units they showed us before taking us there because they admitted it.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />Our real estate agent,Tula, was extremely professional and took the time to understand what we wanted.&nbsp; Finally a break from the slimy folks.. When I met her, I liked her so much that I told my husband I hoped that we&#039;d find an apartment through her.&nbsp; She found us a great unit and even got the rent lowered $100 per month.&nbsp; I would strongly recommend Tula as the best rental agent in Astoria. (631)-478-5973.&nbsp; Tula and her Broker Taso are at Astoria Apartments LLC, located at 21-70 31st St.&nbsp; ( between Ditmars and 21st Ave. ) <br />cheers,<br />Nicole<br />&nbsp;<br />PS: I was a rental agent for 7 years, so I really appreciate a professional realtor.
