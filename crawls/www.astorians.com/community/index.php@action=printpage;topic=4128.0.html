				The most amazing of occurances.&nbsp; Clear proof the collective short-term memory of an entire political party is deficient and highly selective.&nbsp; Way, way down deep Republicans must feel this will make the permanent party of the remaining Redneck contingent.<br /><br />- Cannibal<br />I&#39;m usually not in the Sharpton corner, but hey, this is clearly a batch of white racists covering for other racists.

				you may have noticed Newt Gingrich is making a comeback too...<br /><br />I think some things just don&#39;t seem so bad anymore in light of what the current administration has been up to.

				That seems to mean the Republicans are digging deeper into their base--the people who wish Strom Thurmond had won in 1948.&nbsp; For the rest of us it means the Republicans are showing their true colors.

				I was saddened also. I&#39;m not much for politics, but wasn&#39;t Lott the gent involved with the group in gov&#39;t that opposed homosexuality and it&#39;s ideals?

				Lott is very homophobic.&nbsp; His election really shows what the modern Republican party is all about.

				Thanks McD! Justb wanted to be sure I was correct. Also, I do agree, it does shows where the party lies in it&#39;s platforms. Homos not accepted, yet there are tons of gay Republicans, but they to have restraints it seems. Let&#39;s hope for the best, and make sure us homos out there vote when the votes come around!<br /><br /><br />I am quite surprised and somewhat elated that Eric Goia, I think, actually has emails that come to me about Astoria&#39;s improvements and fights for gov&#39;t funds and opportunities. It&#39;s impressive. The fact that he took an interest in the &quot;as of late&quot; gay bashing in Astoria, pleased me....<br /><br />;)<br />

				Eric is great on LGBT issues.&nbsp; He has had gay staffers and goes to all the LGBT events.&nbsp; He&#39;s the next generation of politicians and is fully committed to our equality.&nbsp; He&#39;s a good guy and I think he&#39;ll go far (I believe he&#39;s going to make a run for Public Advocate in 2009).
