				I never use the sauna so didn&#39;t notice they weren&#39;t working. This was posted somewhere else, but I HAVE noticed that machines seem to be constantly breaking down, etc... I&#39;ve been noticing it less often recently, but still seems too frequent for what we&#39;re paying.

				I have noticed the sauna closed at the Astoria NYSC for a while as well but I don&#39;t consider it as bad as the renovations that have been going on at the 35th and Madison NYSC bathrooms/showers for the past three months. The switch the men&#39;s and women&#39;s rooms according to the day of the month which can get quite confusing.<br /><br />I, too, got the letter about the increased membership fee. Last year, I got the same letter and questioned it. Sure enough, in the fine print of your contract, it states that your membership will go up each year. Yes, it&#39;s annoying, but I do have to say that the NYSC in Astoria is MUCH better than some of the gyms in Manhattan. In my opinion, NYSC at 34th and 6th is a gross dump of a gym and I couldn&#39;t be paid to go there.

				The worst NYSC I&#39;ve been to is the one in the Crown Plaza hotel on 49th and Broadway.&nbsp; Absolutely filthy!&nbsp; You would think it would be better taken care of since it&#39;s in a hotel, and the guests can use it, but it&#39;s disgusting.&nbsp; Most of the lockers are broken, the facilities are nasty, and there&#39;s sweat all over the machines, yuck!!&nbsp; And this is the one with the pool.&nbsp; The showers are like mega force and actually hurts my body with the needle-like pressure.&nbsp; The water leaks all over the floor, and is a slip hazard.<br /><br />I go to the NYSC on 52nd and Broadway, a few blocks up.&nbsp; Empty.&nbsp; Clean.&nbsp; Nice friendly staff.&nbsp; And now 24 hours.&nbsp; Did I say clean?

				It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve been to any of the other NYSC&#39;s - been staying local - I forgot about how gross some of them can be. I agree, I think the Astoria club is one of the nicer/cleaner ones... despite sauna, etc problems.

				Sounds like it&#39;s not a matter of fixing &quot;it&quot; -- considering that it appears to be both the men and women saunas, both are out.&nbsp; I strongly doubt both are broken in any sense.&nbsp; Something real fishy going on here that both will be closed until January.&nbsp; And I doubt you&#39;ll get a straight answer from the manager.

				I&#39;d say in this case &quot;fishy&quot; = bad management.&nbsp; Both saunas have worked in the past, despite occasional down times.&nbsp; The gym has been thriving enough that it&#39;s branched out to two floors.&nbsp; Folks with Astoria-only memberships have stated that they&#39;ve been informed of a rate increase (and most people I know are already spending anywhere form $75 to $95 a month).&nbsp; It could be a case that the project of &quot;fixing&quot; (again, both are broken at the same time?&nbsp; Come on ...) this is in a long line of overall NYSC renovations to various gyms and simply has to wait its turn.<br /><br />Nearly every NYSC I&#39;ve ever been in has had sauna issues at one time or another.&nbsp; A few times, there was clearly a Health Dept notice stating the sauna was closed for failing inspection, or because of &quot;inappropriate use&quot; (mental image of Caligula-style roman orgy).&nbsp; If I&#39;m not mistaken, haven&#39;t seen that sort of notice posted in Astoria.&nbsp; When it&#39;s not Health Dept related, it always seems&nbsp; to be some sort of unexplained mechanical malfunction, although there&#39;s usually something in the posted notice asking users not to change settings themsleves, implying that someone somehow screwed up the sauna by setting it too high?&nbsp; I don&#39;t know.<br /><br />Before NYSC, I went to a social club in midtown that had a gym attached, with a gigantic sauna and steamroom next to each other.&nbsp; Which may have broken down twice in my five years there, and was fixed in a matter of days.&nbsp; As noted earlier, I&#39;m not a sauna person at NYSC due to the cramped quarters, but when you&#39;re paying a nice monthly fee to go there, this is the sort of thing that should be fixed in a few days, not months.&nbsp; And I have a hard time believing money is an issue.&nbsp; Ergo, I&#39;m thinking &quot;bad management.&quot;&nbsp; And that&#39;s what I mean by &quot;fishy&quot;!

				Gotcha. I thought perhaps you had a more sinister scenario in mind.&nbsp; :wink:<br /><br />Guess it would make sense that fixing the sauna is not top priority, given how run-down we&#39;ve mentioned some of the other locations are.... not that that&#39;s fair to those in Astoria.

				The real reason why the sauna is closed and will be closed forever is because New York Sports Club does not have a permit to run a sauna. The Health Dept. also busted inappropriate activity on numerous occasions whenever they made surprise visits. The management at NYSC Astoria is not only greedy but whenever you complain about a broken machine, it takes weeks for the machines to be repaired. Not to mention I have witnessed employees being harassed by Wanda Dryer who is the general manager I have seen her scream, yell and even made crude comments about their appearance. I wouldn&#039;t want to go to a gym where management is only after our money and treats employees like garbage. That shows that if they treat the workers poorly, the customers are going to be treated&nbsp; in the same exact manner.

The Health Dept. also busted inappropriate activity on numerous occasions whenever they made surprise visits. The management at NYSC Astoria is not only greedy but whenever you complain about a broken machine, it takes weeks for the machines to be repaired. Not to mention I have witnessed employees being harassed by Wanda Dryer who is the general manager I have seen her scream, yell and even made crude comments about their appearance. I wouldn&#039;t want to go to a gym where management is only after our money and treats employees like garbage. That shows that if they treat the workers poorly, the customers are going to be treated&nbsp; in the same exact manner. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Is the manager the woman with the ass that has its own zipcode?&nbsp; I don&#039;t get that.&nbsp; How can you work in a fitness facility and not be fit.&nbsp; Don&#039;t get me wrong - I&#039;m not expecting cover-model bodies, I recognize that fitness has many shapes and sizes but there is nothing fit about that woman.

				anyone been to the russianish sauna on northern blvd around 36st? i&#039;m so curious about it. i&#039;ve been wanting to check out the turkish sauna in the east village also. i&#039;m pretty sure it will be disappointing, having avidly attended amazing saunas in korea.

				I gave up on waiting for NYSC and joined Evolution Gym - I love Evolution, Anthony the owner is great, as are the rest of the staff, the small yoga classes and the giant super clean steamroom open 24hrs! Have been to the Turkish sauna in the E.Village and the one on Fulton Street, both are an out-of-NY experience - not posh, but great if you like it extra hot!

				I asked a woman who was taking a &quot;potential member&quot; tour of NYSC what the salesman was saying about the sauna. <br /><br />She said&nbsp; &quot;oh - he said it&#039;s broken but it&#039;s due to be fixed SOON.&quot;<br /><br />Grrrrrrrr.....<br /><br />Is there something we can do - knowing that the saunas (BOTH OF THEM) are NOT broken but are unlicensed and probably won&#039;t be reopening any time soon - yet the sales people are misrepresenting the situation to their members and their potential clients.&nbsp; <br /><br />I mean besides corner the potential new members in the locker room and set them straight (that&#039;s what I did). <br /><br /><br /><br />
