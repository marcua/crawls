				Hey, has anyone been to Freeport on Grand Bahama Island?&nbsp; I&#039;m going there in a few days ( 8-) ) and I&#039;m collecting ideas of what to do there.&nbsp; I&#039;m very excited.&nbsp; I plan to spend my vacation alternating between drunk and hungover but somewhere, between those two, I like to get out and do fun stuff.&nbsp; Any ideas or tips?&nbsp; Fun places?&nbsp; Things to avoid?<br /><br />I&#039;m spending the first three days getting Scuba certified so the underwater world is covered.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				Swim with the dolphins. It&#039;s an experience you&#039;ll never forget. It used to cost around $150 for the trip, but I&#039;m sure the price went up since it is such a popular thing to do. Ask your hotel concierge for details. BTW, where are you staying? I have fond memories of a restaurant called either Stoned Crab or The Crab Stoned. Most places don&#039;t take credit cards, so keep a lot of cash in the safe. Be sure to load up at the duty-free shops, take a breathtaking stroll through the botanical gardens (The Garden of Groves) and if you love golf, you&#039;ll be in heaven. The Fortune Hills golf course is stunning. You are overlooking the ocean on some holes. Just magnificent. If you are going alone they will pair you up with someone. If you are a water-sport enthusiast you&#039;re not going to contain your enthusiasm for all the activities available; windsurfing, para-sailing, jet skiing . . . a virtual water paradise. Also, if you still have some time, visit the Perfume Factory. It is a wonderfully unique experience. Have a ball, and report back here when you return.

				Wow, Mamamac, you&#039;ve done, like, everything.&nbsp; I&#039;m all about the Perfume Factory.&nbsp; That was one thing on my list.&nbsp; It sounds really amazing.&nbsp; I like botanical gardens.&nbsp; That sounds beautiful.&nbsp; I&#039;m not so good at golf but my bf is so maybe I&#039;ll let him talk me into going.&nbsp; Just for the scenery.&nbsp; &nbsp;And I like driving the carts.&nbsp; I&#039;m staying in a townhouse that&#039;s part of a resort.&nbsp; My friend has a time-share so there will be six of us total in the house.

				Don&#039;t forget to see the Bazaar..............I hope it&#039;s as nice as it used to be. A different country represented around every corner...and SHOPPING!! Then flop on the beach and have some margaritas. I saw Ike and Tina Turner there (yes, the last ice age) and it was great.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-P
