				So i thought it would be cool to start amassing a little online collection of menus for us. You know, when you&#039;re at work and thinking about take out and there is no &quot;menu pages site&quot; for our little piece of the world- it might prove useful. I made a flickr set for it. I&#039;ve only got a few right now, but i figure if i can bring one in each day and scan it and post it, we might get a decent selection. Feel free to direct me towards some that are necessities and i will try to grab a menu at some point and scan it in. Yeah i have some free time at work right now...&nbsp; :roll:<br /><br />http://www.flickr.com/photos/flooznyc/sets/72157600011409218/ (http://www.flickr.com/photos/flooznyc/sets/72157600011409218/)

				This is a great idea, but is there anyway to label these so that you can tell what they are before you click on them?&nbsp; It will make a lot of hunting to find the right menu unless you can recognize it from the thumbnail...<br /><br />Thanks, Flooz!

				I will label them all as well as i can. I&#039;ll also make sure the tags are as descriptive as possible. From what i can see, there is no way to see the labels when you are looking at the entire pool. But what i think is a better idea is once in the group pool, do a search with the name of the palce you&#039;re looking for. It will pop up if its in there. Just make sure you are doing a search of just that group.
