				At one time or another (and almost certainly more), this has happened to all of us:<br /><br />N/W service gets screwy and the line shuts down between Manhattan and Queens. Sometimes, you can take the 7 to Queensboro Plaza, where they'll shuttle an N/W train back and forth between there and Ditmars.<br /><br />:?: Question is, what to do when there's no N/W service at all? What's the best way to get to 30th Ave (and points North) along the N/W line? <br /><br />It seems like the only way to get close to there is by taking a cab from Queensboro Plaza (which is what I end up doing). Yeah, it's only like $5, but that's still money I wasn't planning on spending. (I use a monthly Metrocard, so any other subway or bus rides are &quot;free&quot; to me)<br /><br />Sure, I could take the R to Steinway &amp; Broadway and walk from there, but it's about a 15-minute walk to 30th Ave... which I don't mind so much except when it's pouring rain or freezing cold (often the case when the subway gets screwed up).<br /><br />Is there a bus that approximates the N/W route? <br /><br />Or should I just suck it up and keep taking cabs in this situation? I know that's probably the &quot;best&quot; way, I'm just curious if anyone has alternatives.<br /><br />thanks!

				Q19A takes you to Ditmars via 21st Street.<br />Q101--I'm not sure about this one, but it should get you up into the general area. &nbsp;Check with MTA. &nbsp;718-330-1234

				You can head over to 21st Street across Queensbridge Apts. and grab the 19 A bus. It goes straight up 21st Street all the way to Ditmars and then on to LaGuardia Marine Terminal area. Take caution, though -- Queensbridge can be an unsafe area.<br /><br />There may be other buses as well. Check out the MTA's bus service map (http://mta.info/nyct/maps/busqns.pdf) as well. You need a PDF reader or a PDF-friendly browser to read it.<br /><br />e: crossed w/ <strong>Telesphoros</strong>. &nbsp;:oops: &nbsp;:D

				Q101 goes from 2nd Ave near 58th st Manhattan to Queens Plaza, then to Steinway Street. If you're really tired, you can switch at 30th/Steinway for the Q18.<br /><br />Queens bus map is at http://mta.info/nyct/maps/busqns.pdf

				I just perused that map -- the 101R goes to Rikers. Good to know. ;)<br /><br />There's a 102 bus that runs up 31st St, then over 30 Avenue to what looks like Crescent. Queens Surface Corp runs it: 718-445-3100. I couldn't find a website for them though...<br /><br />I thought the MTA now owns all these erstwhile independent bus companies. Why haven't they updated their schedule info. Oh wait, they're too busy deciding what constitutes an &quot;open container&quot; and flip-flopping on keeping personnel on trains... &nbsp;:roll: &nbsp;:D

				Another alternative, and this is assuming you know about the subway problems <em>before</em> you've crossed the river, before you're stuck at Queens/Queensboro Plaza...<br /><br />You can take the 4 up to 125th St. and catch the M60 bus to Astoria Blvd (&amp; 31st St.) This is actually a pretty slick route if you live in the 30th Ave area, and I would think a pretty reasonable walk for anyone headed to Ditmars as well.<br /><br />Only drawback with this route is if it's late at night... as a petite woman, I wouldn't feel all that safe hanging around alone waiting for the bus in that neck of the woods.

				artgirl,<br />I'm shocked that you are able to find a cab at queensboro plaza, that is the reason it's so lousy to get stuck there, I never see tlc cars in that area.. are you calling a car service from your cell phone to pick you up, or have you been able to hail cabs from there?

				tuesday,<br /><br />I've actually had good luck hailing yellow cabs there... I've found the best place to be is under the tracks where they bend around to 31st Street. Go to the East side of 31st Street (the right side for Astoria-bound cabs coming around that bend), where they'll be able to pull off to the side. If you try to get a cab before this point, there's not really a good place for them to pull over, and they'll pass you by. (Don't try to hail a cab headed toward Manhattan because at a certain point there's nowhere for them to turn around)<br /><br />Just <em>be careful</em> walking over there, as you have to cross some turn lanes with cars whipping around corners... wait for your walk light, even the traffic signal is red.<br /><br />(Since so many cab drivers are based in Queens, <em>sometimes</em> they'll stop for you even if they're off-duty because it's not really out of their way to make a close stop.)
