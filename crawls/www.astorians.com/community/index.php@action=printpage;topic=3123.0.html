				Well just last week, I guess the debate was going on, and there was a point when they said &quot;Yes, it is a planet&quot;&nbsp; Colbert Report: 8/17 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwocBYzqMRA&nbsp; Hilarious!<br /><br />It is weird that after stating that it IS a planet, it is NOT anymore.<br /><br />(I haven&#39;t found his recent airing on YouTube yet.)

				Oh my goodness!&nbsp; My 9th grade science teacher taught us Kings Play Chess on Fine Glass Sets, and once we got that down, we had to recite the actual thing over and over again for the first 5 minutes of every class.&nbsp; And we all had to stand up and yell it!!<br /><br /><em>Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species</em>.&nbsp; At the end of which, Mr Hawkins would holler, &quot;AGAIN!!&quot;&nbsp; Interestingly, Mr Hawkins bore a striking an unfortunate resemblance to Hitler, complete with toothbrush moustache.&nbsp; <br /><br />He never mentioned Pluto&#39;s planetary status.
