				Does anyone know what&#39;s to become of this space &quot;Locale&quot; on 34th Ave &amp; 33rd St (near the old Tupelo)? Or am I just making this up? I walked by it during the transit strike and it had this big beautiful storefront of black-enamel painted window panes... but now I dont see the sign anymore? <br /><br />muchas gracias...

				Yes, I went there, it&#39;s a restaurant club of sorts. The food was not bad, though the menu was not terribly inspired (we only tried the appetizers) and the music was far too loud.<br /><br />the space is lovely though and it was actually packed... the one waiter was fairly overwhelmed.<br />

				I have been to Locale twice and I absolutely love it!<br />It is simple yet elegant as well as classic with a tinge of old world.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />The food is super, the aesthetic is beautiful.&nbsp; In addition to tables thee is a very elegant bar area as well as a small elevated lounge with couches.&nbsp; <br /><br />The music was varied.&nbsp; I enjoyed mellow electronica, and faster ambient beats, as well as some jazz and a little bit of the classic , sexy r &amp; b like Sade. They also played the entirety of Depeche Mode&#39;s new album and some euro-centric electro.&nbsp; Unfortunately they did throw some current pop in there, but I was happy regardless, as I sipped my Sauvignon Blanc and savored a huge plate of fried calamari. <br /><br /><br />

				i admit defeat. <br />i just do not <strong><em>get</em></strong> this place.<br />ultra-priced, uber-serious, over-loud, and a conspicuously manufactured atmosphere. <br />friends and i find the seats butt-wrenchingly uncomfortable.<br />i&#39;m sure it will do well, and i hope it does, but alls i can say is i don&#39;t get it and i give up trying.<br />maybe i just miss the hardware store that used to be there. boo hoo. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
