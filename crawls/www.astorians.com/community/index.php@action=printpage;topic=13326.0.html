				Hello everyone! <br /><br />My wife and I are looking for a reputable car dealer.&nbsp; We are expecting in April, and we&#039;d like to have a car to get to family, doctors, etc...<br /><br />Anyone know anything about the car dealers at the end of Steinway? I&#039;m looking for a used car, and I&#039;d prefer to stick with a dealer in case of any problems. <br /><br />Thank you in advance! <br /><br />Bill

				It all depends if you&#039;re looking for a new or used car. If you&#039;re looking for used then I don&#039;t recommend using a dealer at all - they can be a huge headache and will inevitably costing you a lot more $. I got a used Honda Civic a couple of months ago on Craigslist. It worked out really well but you have to do your homework: <br /><br />1.Research what make/model car you want to buy first and find out how much it should cost (Kelly&#039;s bluebook website is good). <br />2. When you contact the owner ask for the VIN number - if they can&#039;t/won&#039;t give it to you immediately, move on.<br />3. Check the VIN number on Carfax.com. They charge a small fee to do this but it&#039;s a must. If there is ANYTHING that comes up negative, move on - there are lots of cars out there.<br />4. Meet up with the seller and take the car for a test drive. Look at everything (inc. radio, heat/aircon, headlights, tires). Ask a lot of questions.<br />5. Take the car to a mechanic of your choice (if the seller isn&#039;t in your area find one that&#039;s in theirs) and have them do an inspection - it shouldn&#039;t take more that one hour or cost more than $50. If the seller doesn&#039;t want to do this, move on.<br />6. If everything looks good, make an offer based not on the asking price, but on the value of the car minus the estimated cost of repairs it might need. <br /><br />Remember, there are lots of cars out there. Don&#039;t be afraid to walk away unless you find the right car in the right situation for the right price!!!

				I have been looking for a used car for a number of months, and I totally concur with everything redtrainrider said. But, I would like to add a few more things to list.<br /><br />First of all, try to get to see the car at least 30 minutes earlier than your appointment. You just might find the seller getting the car ready for you to see. THAT IS A RED FLAG WARNING.<br /><br />Be sure to bring a flashlight and a small magnet with you. The magnet will tell you if there has been an accident if it doesn&#039;t adhere to all doors, the hood and the trunk; and the flashlight will help you look under the car if you know what you are looking for and making sure all the tires are the same size!<br /><br />Also be sure to check out the horn; if it has a CD or tape player, bring one with you to test; verify that the flashers and turn signals are working properly; make sure ALL windows, seats and dash bulbs are working properly.<br /><br />But none of this will be necessary if you don&#039;t the the Carfax report on the VIN BEFORE you go to inspect the car.
