				I remember going with my brother to the eastern part of Astoria, right near a highway, to drop off a cable box at a Time-Warner drop-off center. Now I need to drop off a cable box myself. But I can&#39;t seem to find any information about the drop-off center in the Time-Warner site. Does anyone know if it&#39;s still there?

				It&#39;s long gone.<br /><br />You need to go to:<br />Queens Center Mall<br />9015 Queens Boulevard (Queens &amp; Woodhaven Boulevards at LIE)<br />Elmhurst, NY 11373-4900<br />(718) 358-0900<br /><br />Monday–Saturday: 10:00 AM–9:30 PM<br />Sunday: 11:00 AM–6:00 PM<br /><br />Or is another borough better for you?

				Thank you, NYCMacUser.<br />Yes, that is the nearest listing to me given on the Time-Warner website. So, I guess the Astoria drop-off center is no more? I suppose I&#39;ll be going to the Elmhurst location, then if the Astoria one is no longer there.<br />It was about twelve years ago that I went to the Astoria location with my brother that time.

				There is one in Manhattan on 23rd St, I beleive.&nbsp; May be easier than going all the way to the mall.&nbsp; I&#39;m sure you could find that on the website too.

				Let me know if you&#39;re able to successfully do what you need to do at the Manhattan one, because I went through a whole thing over the phone with Time Warner about that.&nbsp; I wanted to pick up a self-installation kit, and they were going to send me to Elmhurst or Jamaica.&nbsp; I protested that I work in Manhattan and it would be a million times easier to pick it up there.&nbsp; They said that apparently the Queens kits are different, and are inventoried such that a Queens customer has to pick up and return everything in Queens, and that if I wanted to try to pick it up in Manhattan, Time Warner would &quot;not be responsible for the consequences.&quot;&nbsp; I asked what these consquences might be, and could not elicit an intelligible gibberish-free answer.<br />so, let me know how it goes, I&#39;m curious.<br /><br />bennyt

				I was able to change cable boxes and internet modem at the 23rd Street location in Manhattan, it wasn&#39;t even an issue. But that was last year, perhaps they changed policies about locations?

				Don&#39;t go to Manhattan!&nbsp; The boxes for Manhattan and Queens are different.&nbsp; When I moved from Manhattan to Astoria, I went to the Manhattan office and they gave me a box, but it wasn&#39;t a &quot;Queens box&quot;.&nbsp; They told me to just take that box to the Queens office and exchange it for an appropriate one.&nbsp; It was fine, but I had to make two trips to get the box.<br /><br />Later, my DVR fritzed and I called T-W and they said it was ok to go to Manhattan. At that office, they told me I had to go to the Queens one (might have been because they didn&#39;t have the Queens box on hand), so two trips again.&nbsp; It&#39;s all fine now, but unless you&#39;re just dropping off, don&#39;t go to Manhattan.
