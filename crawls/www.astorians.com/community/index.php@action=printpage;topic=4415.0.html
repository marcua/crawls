				As I head off to my company holiday party tonight, I can&#39;t help but laugh (and pinpoint exactly who is who at my office) using Gawker&#39;s guide to holiday parties.<br /><br /><br />http://www.gawker.com/news/unsolicited/unsolicited-everything-i-needed-to-know-about-office-parties-i-learned-in-high-school-221375.php (http://www.gawker.com/news/unsolicited/unsolicited-everything-i-needed-to-know-about-office-parties-i-learned-in-high-school-221375.php)<br /><br /><strong>Unsolicited: Everything I Needed To Know About Office Parties, I Learned In High School</strong><br /><br />At some publishing office Xmas bashes, they serve chili from crockpots in the conference room. At others, they serve caviar at the Four Seasons. But no matter how posh or pedestrian the surroundings, there&#39;s one constant in this geekiest of industries: everyone becomes a effing teenager once they get a little booze in them. The question, though, is what kind of high school style role will everyone fall into? <br /><br />&nbsp; The cool (&quot;cool&quot;) kids: Either the younger editors or the art department, depending on the publishing house/imprint. They leave early to go somewhere better and talk s___ about the total plebes that comprise the rest of the company.<br /><br />&nbsp; The wannabes: The boringest departments always get the drunkiest. This is their chance to shine! Alvin from contracts seems so mild-mannered all the other 364 days of the year, but come party time, he&#39;s suddenly breaking it down like Little Superstar. And why is Sara from preproduction doing the chicken noodle soup dance?<br /><br />&nbsp; The cool teacher: Every house has one -- that one older person (usually a dude) who is cool enough to hang with the younger kids. To his peers, there is something mildly creepy about him. He will hit on an intern tonight. Guarantee it. <br /><br />&nbsp; The chess club: The boring older editors, who like to bring their significant others to the party. This is a great time to get an inside peek into some inscrutable home lives. Expect some stilted, uncomfortable conversations. Even with the booze, most these spouses are so socially awkward, it&#39;s reasonable to assume they may have crawled out from some abandoned subway tunnel like mole people. <br /><br />&nbsp; The once a year hos: They are the ones sticking their boobs out at every available (and maybe not-exactly-available) straight guy. Yup, all two of them. <br /><br />&nbsp; The cheerleaders: Publicists are just cheerleaders, all grown up. It&#39;s hard to hate them when they&#39;re telling you how AWESOME!!!! you are and how much they LOOOOOVE YOU GUYS!! while downing their fifth pink margarita and swaying drunkenly to the music.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

Or maybe three. The first is that I don&#39;t drink, so that kind of takes the purpose out of wanting to go. The second thing is that I&#39;m not one ofr big social events, and because I work in a very competitive industry, which some could even call &#39;cutthroat&#39; or even pretentious, I like to keep my social life very separate from my professional life.<br /><br />I&#39;ll probably go to my fiancee&#39;s xmas party. It was a big event at some place in Central Park. Not Tavern on teh Green, I don&#39;t think. I can&#39;t remember. But I don&#39;t have to schmooze or wear my corporate mask there. I just eat some good food and try to pretend to hear people are saying over the very loud noise.&nbsp; :-D

				Our holiday party was yesterday. I have to say that it was better than last year in some aspects, but overall I wouldn&#39;t say it was that great. First of all I figured that I might be able to do vegetarian okay, but the only pasta dish they had there had little pieces of ham on top (wtf?), but I took it anyway and made sure each piece of pasta was sans little piggy. Then the vegetables and salad were only mediocre, and the desserts were not that fantastic either. On top of all of this one of my table companions decided to launch into a tirade (as he often does), and when I tried to point out that that was only an opinion that he was sharing he basically said that no, it wasn&#39;t an opinion, but fact.<br /><br />Overall it was okay, but then again - we have to pay for our party ($15 - but my boss paid for our team to go). I could most certainly live without and this year I almost decided to do that, but got convinced to go. Maybe next year I&#39;ll skip out. <br /><br />Oh and what&#39;s even worse is that everyone there usually laments, &quot;Our parties used to be so good.&quot; :roll:

				My work Christmas party is tomorrow and I am really excited.&nbsp; There&#39;s usually really good food and a raffle with fantastic prizes (including open plane tickets.)&nbsp; Last year our party was catered by Blue Smoke--I&#39;m hoping for Shake Shack this year, yum!&nbsp; The funniest part of our party is that people tend to get freaky on the dance floor at about 9.
