				So I&#039;m trying to quit smoking and wanted to see if anyone else had accomplished this feat or had tips, tricks, hints... especially anything I can do to try to be less of a grump than I&#039;m already starting to be.

				I quit 6 years ago cold turkey. Its hard- not gonna lie but it was the best thing I ever did. I still miss it sometimes but I am glad I was able to do it. A big motivating factor for me was health. I kept getting bronchitis and chest infections, since I quit I have been much healthier. Saving money was also an incentive.<br /><br />One of the things that helped me quit was not drinking for a couple of weeks as drinking and smoking went hand and hand. Might be differant now that bars no longer let you smoke inside. Exercise helped too. It was hard to run or do any form of exercise without getting out of breathe.<br /><br />If you need any support I would be happy to help you and I promise I won&#039;t lecture. Not a fan of people who used to smoke that act all high a mighty now that they have quit. Best of luck to you. <br /><br /><br />

				Thanks a lot for the words of advice.<br /><br />I just turned 24 and had a new person in my life ask me how long I&#039;d been smoking for and when I realized that it had been 10 years, it freaked me out a lot.<br /><br />I have quit before for 6 month stints, but it would always fade when I moved somewhere else, got a new social group or what have you. <br /><br />Have you ever, in those 6 years, had a bad night or given in? Have you ever snuck a smoke? Do you ever do it occasionally or are you just flat-out fuggidabowdit done?

				I haven&#039;t had a cigarette since I quit. I have wanted to, - came close to it several times- but I know my personality (addictive) so I thought better of it. I think it helped that I quit the month before I met my husband - he HATES cigarettes. So that motivated me even more to not smoke. <br /><br />Just don&#039;t beat yourself up if you do have one. Try to get back on track and remind yourself why you are doing it. Bottom line is you have to be really ready to do it. I tried to quit a few times before I was successful. <br /><br />Have you thought about trying acupuncture? I know some people say that it works for them.

				I&#039;m actually really really terrified of needles, so that&#039;s a no go. (Kinda funny from somone with tattoos...)<br /><br />I&#039;m hoping that this is the for real time and not another couple of month stint but I guess there&#039;s no way to really know and I just have to go for it.

				I quit smoking back in June 01, I was 23 and had been smoking since I was 15. I don&#039;t remember exactly why I quit, but when I was driving to work (I had a 2 mile, 8 minute commute, aaaah the days), I thought to myself, &quot;I wonder what would happen if I didn&#039;t have a cigarette on the way to work.&quot; It felt really wierd but it was ok. Then it was kind of like a game with myself, &quot;I wonder if I can make it to lunch without one, Let&#039;s see what happens if I go til 3:30 without one.&quot; Kind of dorky, but it got me through the first few days.<br /><br />After that, it was hard to break the routine of taking little breaks throughout the day to go smoke - I used to go out back by receiving for the building and BS with the guys down there, and I really did miss going, sitting outside, all of that. That&#039;s the part that really stunk for me.<br /><br />Oh, this is kind of silly too, but sign up on quitnet.com. You put in how many cigarettes you smoked each day, the day you quit, and how much you paid per pack. It&#039;ll keep a running tally of cigarettes not smoked and money saved.&nbsp; I just logged in (I haven&#039;t been on there in AGES), and its kind of ridiculous what my numbers are up to.

				http://www.nysmokefree.com/newweb/default.aspx<br /><br />I&#039;m not a smoker but I&#039;m literally surrounded by them.&nbsp; My mother of 50 has finally quit smoking this past New Year&#039;s, and she&#039;s going cold turkey.&nbsp; My father is still smoking though, and the stubborn type, so he&#039;s not much help to her endeavor.&nbsp; Many of my friends smoke as well.&nbsp; I probably don&#039;t smoke out of pure fear.&nbsp; If everyone has such a hard time quitting, I better not even try it.&nbsp; I hate to think that something has to happen for my father to actually think about quitting.&nbsp; I really hate it.<br /><br />The above website has helped a few friends of mine.&nbsp; They even have a counselor who can be a mentor to you.&nbsp; Best of luck to you, you can do this, but it&#039;s going to take perseverance and courage.

				Paratactical, good luck ! &nbsp;<br /><br />As you know, I&#039;ve been trying for the past three years! &nbsp;Unfortunately, something keeps pulling me back in. &nbsp;Currently, I am taking the generic form of Welbutrin for quitting, but apparently, you are not supposed to go out on the weekends and smoke three packs and then go back on bupropion during the week. &nbsp;I was going to try Chantix but the three people I know who were on it, had nausea and other unpleasant side effects, like severe depression. &nbsp;<br /><br />In my only other serious attempt to quit, back in 1998 or so, I paid for Zyban, as it was not covered by my insurance company and it worked, even though sort of knocked me on my butt. &nbsp;That stuff was really strong and I think if this bupropion doesn&#039;t work by the end of the month, I am going to pay the $150 + out of my pocket for the real stuff!

				I had to stop about 5 years ago when I had surgery for a chest infection.&nbsp; Since then, the pulmonary dr. who diagnosed me and got me to a surgeon has been my primary care guy. He was very surprised that I stopped cold. Every time I go in the first thing he asks is, &quot;when did you have your last cigarette?&quot; and so far the answer hasn&#039;t changed. Whenever&nbsp; time I am tempted to smoke, I think of having to admit it to him and decide, naw, it&#039;s not worth it this time.<br /><br />Still, I do look forward to the time I am old and decrepit enough that I can take it up again.

				Right on, paratactical -- go go go!!!&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />It CAN be done.<br /><br />Next week will be 4 years without a ciggie for yours truly -- and I&#039;d been smoking since &#039;91. I think it was on quitnet.com where I got this great piece of info: when you quit, you&#039;re going to feel sick, so treat it like you are sick: take a few days off if you can, lounge around eating grilled cheese and tomato soup, watch lots old movies. Take. It. Easy.<br /><br />As it turned out, the weekend I decided to quit was also when I had a horrible cold; so I couldn&#039;t tell the difference anyway between the withdrawal and real illness...<br /><br />Not saying you should wait to get a cold, though!&nbsp; :lol: <br /><br />Few other things I learned that helped for me:<br /><br />- lots of liquids (for me it was water and fresh juice I was making for myself)<br />- less salty foods<br />- remind myself that I&#039;m not going to have a cigarette <em>now</em>; kept it in the moment.<br />- accepting that there&#039;s no way I can be an occasional smoker; I tried having only 1-2 cigarettes a week and within 2 weeks I was back up to a pack a day.<br />- nicotine stays in the body for about 3 hours; it&#039;s metabolic derivatives only about 7 days<br />- for most people, it takes 30-45 days to form -- and break -- a habit<br /><br />I also learned that my other attempts to quit didn&#039;t work not because of the craving, but because I <em>feared getting a craving</em>. It was an important distinction for me to make, and it helped me see beyond the first pulses of anxiety, then deal with whatever withdrawal I was feeling by drinking some water or juice...<br /><br />One last note: I tried the nicotine gum before, but that didn&#039;t work. It just prolonged my nicotine dependence.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size">GOOD LUCK!!!</span>

				A couple of things that helped me...<br /><br />1.) Keeping some things around to snack on since my appetite increased when I quit.&nbsp; Sunflower seeds were key since they were healthier than candy and helped with the whole oral fixation thing.<br /><br />2.) Taking deep breaths when I would inevitably get the urge to smoke.<br /><br />3.) Toothpicks.&nbsp; I carried around a bunch of round-center toothpicks to put in my mouth/play with during those times when I would have normally been doing that with a cigarette like after eating, on the way to and from work, and at the bar when you could still smoke there.&nbsp; <br />Note: Chewing them until they splinter in your mouth does not release any hidden nicotine for some reason, but it did help me to quit. :mrgreen:

				Thanks for all the great advice and support so far!<br /><br />Any tips for how to deal with when you flub up? How did you keep on with the &quot;quitting&quot; after screwing up and having one? I know that&#039;s always been my downfall before--that I&#039;ll get drunk and have one or two and then the next day I&#039;m a-smokin&#039; all over again, figuring a whole what does it matter kind of perspective. How did you guys manage to get over your hiccups or did you just flat out not have them?

The taste and smell, the idea of having to go through the physical withdrawal <em>again</em>. I still remind myself of this -- especially when I work a really long day.

				Hey Y&#039;all,<br /><br />First, let me say, I&#039;m loving this post.&nbsp; I just got over a horrible cold, and went to the doctor and begged for some help.&nbsp; I&#039;m taking a drug called Chantix.&nbsp; I have heard some mixed things about the medication, but I&#039;ve been smoking a pack a day for 13 years.&nbsp; I needed something.&nbsp; I&#039;m only in week 2 of the cycle, but it has begun to help the cravings...much more than the patch or gum. <br /><br />I have a quit date for next week, and am SO nervous about that.<br /><br />Is anyone else trying Chantix?&nbsp; I&#039;m curious to know.<br /><br />xoxo,<br />CS

				So I&#039;m a little late. <br /><br />I quit cold turkey this past July. Get nose surgery!!! If you have health insurance. And days off. I had enlarged Adenoids and a severely deviated Septum. I smoked my last cigarette outside the hospital before I went in for the surgery. I didn&#039;t mean to quit. It wasn&#039;t something I intentionally, or even knowingly did, actually I had gone to DC the weekend before and came back with a whole carton of cigarettes! What ended up happening, was after the damn surgery **those with weak stomaches do not continue reading this** my nose was bleeding nonstop for almost a week. I looked like someone beat me in the face with a skillet. I had to keep gauze pads taped over my nose, and change them every 30 minutes because they were full of blood and boogers and goo. I also had these plastic brace things sewed into my septum to make sure it healed straight, so I had to clean around them with freakin&#039; q tips! anyway I was in so much freaking pain and so drugged I forgot what a cigarette was! Until my ever loving boyfriend (the insensitive, irresponsible, selfish mooch!) would come over to check on me, and spend time with me, and conveniently smoke all the cigarettes I brought back from DC. I would watch him smoke and remember how much smoking hurt my insides when I had a bad sinus infection cold thing or worse when I had strep throat, and the very thought of that kind of pain on top of the excruciatingly unbearable pain I was already in made me pop an extra vic every time.&nbsp; The pain was totally worth it, because now I sleep better (never mind my insomnia, thats different) and I also save money. Once my nose healed and I was back to smelling things and working and picking my nose, I just never picked up another cig. As I mentioned, my boyfriend smoked all the ones I had, and so I just never bought more, and when they would light up in front of me I would make sure not to look at them when they take a drag. Thats the part that makes me miss it. Watching the little cherry get all red hot while someone is taking a drag. <br />jesus Im long winded tonite!<br /><br />ps I&#039;d been smoking daily since age 12, which was 10 years when I stopped.

				&nbsp;:-o Whoa! Congratulations on quitting smoking! I didn&#039;t realize fixing a deviated septum required so much pain and torment! Having quit smoking-also cold turkey-almost 15 years ago, I&#039;m amazed at the high price of cigarettes these days. That would be enough for me to give up the habit. I think cold turkey is torture enough without the surgery! Sometimes though, it takes a few attempts to officially quit. It doesn&#039;t really get easier after the first month-didn&#039;t for me anyways, but if you stay strong and committed you will eventually free yourself after a few months from the grip of nicotine addiction. I used to smoke Lucky Strike (half a pack a day) because they were the only cigs around that tasted like tobacco to me-but they were smooth-unlike Camels. Yecch!! Good luck!

				My only word of advice I guess is that you gotta go 100% on quitting- no &quot;one cigarette won&#039;t hurt&quot; mentality, cause you just end up right back in there. <br />Every time I try and quit, it&#039;s always a stupid drunk night out that I end up with a cigarette hanging out my mouth, and right back to smoking. So go with fully quitting, not weening. <br />My dad recently quit after 35 years of smoking, and he did it with the Gum. He still chews it, and it&#039;s kind of expensive, but that might be an option for you. He has been 6 months without one after 35 years straight of smoking like an industrial chimney.<br /><br />Good luck, para! :mrgreen:

				I&#039;ve been trying to quit fairly intensely for the past 4 months.&nbsp; I started with Wellbutrin/Zyban and it messed with my head (a lot).&nbsp; It set me back a little but recently, I&#039;ve been using the patch and it is helping me a lot.&nbsp; I still want to smoke but it&#039;s easier to forget about it and not dwell on it.&nbsp; Another thing that has helped was reading the book &quot;The Easy Way to Stop Smoking&quot; by Allen Carr.&nbsp; It has changed my mentality about smoking quite a bit.<br /><br />Good luck!

				I&#039;ve a serious nicotine addiction. I tried Zyban- it helped b/c if I had a smoke it made me nauseous, but after a few months I went back. I did cold turkey and lasted about a year.<em> Et cetera.</em><br />Then I called nyc 311- they sent a generic version of the patch, free! (They also did an intake over the phone that made me realize I have been smoking twenty years!)<br />The great part about getting the patch was realizing that I was not demonic from withdrawal, however, the adhesive is terrible (it&#039;s free and generic), so, I started spending the money I used to spend on smokes on a name brand patch. <br />The adhesive was much better- very important to me as I am a swimmer, jogger, and the generic patch would either fall off during the after-exercise shower, or while I was on treadmill from&nbsp; sweat.<br />I still messed up many times. The day I go by is the first day of last summer, by then I was much less tempted. I had absolutely zero alcohol for three months, because the people around me who helped noted I was most vulnerable when under the influence of alcohol. <br />I also outlawed smoking in my kitchen; even the second hand smoke was enough to reawaken my addiction.<br />It has been about nine months now. I&#039;ve had a few setbacks, always while under the influence of alcohol. <br />The other night I went out and overdid it to the point where I don&#039;t recall walking home and I woke up panicked wondering if I had smoked. My clothes didn&#039;t smell like smoke, so I concluded I hadn&#039;t. (yeah, I know that&#039;s not the worst thing about not remembering ten minutes of one&#039;s life, but, whatever)<br />Some of my closest friends smoke, so I try and go places where smoking isn&#039;t allowed. I haven&#039;t been to the cafes in a while- too tempting. <br />Carrying a pen and paper is my substitute. If i feel nervous (one of my triggers) I just start writing- I write about how i want to smoke but i will not. <br />That&#039;s they key, i think; know what your triggers are and have a strategy for substitute behavior (like pounding madly away on a keyboard). And don&#039;t kick your ass when you falter-it&#039;s too easy to go on a binge. <br />Besides, why give those dirtbags your hard earned money- since I stopped the patch I have set aside the money I used to spend. I spend it on concert tix these days :-)

				I quit for 4 years.&nbsp; Then just thought &quot;oh I&#039;ll one.&quot; Right.&nbsp; 2 years + and I&#039;m still trying to quit.&nbsp; I can go two months then something ticks me off and it&#039;s get a gun or have a cigarette.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think I&#039;m cut out for jail.&nbsp; But sometimes, I get ticked off and I realize it will pass and it does.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t had a smoke in two weeks.<br /><br />I like smoking.&nbsp; I like the ritual. But I hate the way it tastes and smells. ugh.&nbsp; good luck, para. if you&#039;re still not smoking.
