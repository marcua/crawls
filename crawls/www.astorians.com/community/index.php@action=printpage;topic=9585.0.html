				Ok...&nbsp; don&#039;t know if anyone can help or offer a suggestion but what the hell.<br /><br />Bought these shirts online : http://www.amazon.com/Magellan%C2%AE-Outdoor-Shirts-PORT-ROYAL/dp/B000YER3FM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;m=A19XE0CFLN81HP&amp;s=sporting-goods&amp;qid=1203785501&amp;sr=1-1<br /><br />Now their great.&nbsp; &nbsp;Many pockets, vented back and long tails so they don&#039;t pull out of my pants.&nbsp; Perfect for work.&nbsp; &nbsp; My problem is that the royal blue and the port royal (burgandy-ish) are still bleeding the colors.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have washed them at least 4 times each.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t care so much but if I roll my sleeves up my arms are either light blue or pink.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ideas?&nbsp; Anyone, anyone?&nbsp; &nbsp;Bueller... bueller?

				What temp are you washing them in?&nbsp; Hot water will cause excess bleeding, so if you&#039;re washing the shirts in hot or warm water, try washing them in cold.&nbsp; That may help a little.<br /><br />There is some info here (http://www.pburch.net/dyeing/FAQ/fixrit.shtml) about fixing dyes (dye fixatives (http://www.pburch.net/dyeing/FAQ/fixative.shtml)) and removing excess dyes (Synthrapol (http://www.pburch.net/dyeing/FAQ/synthrapol.shtml)) with formulated chemical products.&nbsp; There are certain types of dye you are not supposed to use those on, though, which may be difficult since you probably don&#039;t know what type of dye was used to dye your shirt.&nbsp; It emphasises that home remedies such as using salt or vinegar don&#039;t work.

				OK, maybe bleeding wasn&#039;t the right term.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am using hot water, but to flush as much color out as I can.&nbsp; &nbsp;They&#039;re turning me colors as I&#039;m wearing them... when they&#039;re dry.&nbsp; &nbsp;I can&#039;t see how which temp I wash them in would affect them later on when I wear them.&nbsp; &nbsp;Testosterone doesn&#039;t usually equal laundry prowess, so I guess I&#039;ll give cold water a shot.

				Well, if they&#039;re staining your arms (which I did see), they&#039;re bleeding in the wash.&nbsp; It basically means that they dye in the shirts isn&#039;t fixed well.&nbsp; Washing them in cold water might help minimise the bleeding and subsequent arm-staining.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if it will completely work, but in my experience washing clothes in cold water does minimise bleeding.&nbsp; In the links I posted, there&#039;s reference to a dye fixative called Retayne, which they say is sold at local quilting supply shops.&nbsp; There are some fabric stores around in Astoria, and they might carry stuff like that.
