				It&#039;s an all-male class with a male instructor. <br />1) Some boys feel uncomfortable pairing up with girls for pratice of self-defense techniques, since it involves physical contact, however minimal. <br />2) An all-male class has a different dynamic from a mixed class and allows boys to ask a greater variety of questions unhindered by societal norms.<br />3) Some families have religious views and prefer a male only class.<br /><br />We have self-defense classes for different groups at different times. We have had a women&#039;s self-defense course taught by a female instructor. In the future there will be self defense classes for girls only (8-14) - for the same reasons as above, a mixed class for youngsters (4-7), etc. Dates undetermined.
