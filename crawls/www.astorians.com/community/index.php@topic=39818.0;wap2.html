			Hello all, I&#039;m a local writer and I just wanted to get the word out about my book, Stalker, which was recently released.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />It&#039;s a suspense book about a man who becomes obsessed with a woman he sees on the N train.&nbsp; It takes place in Astoria and it&#039;s written from his point of view, so he doesn&#039;t realize just how crazy he gets in his attempt to find out more about her.&nbsp; I&#039;m including the link to a commercial a friend helped me film on 30th Ave about the book and I&#039;m also including a link to the book&#039;s Amazon page. I hope you&#039;ll check it out and that you like what you see.<br /><br /><br />Thanks for reading!<br /><br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jnZa1FbnWQ&amp;feature=share<br /><br />https://www.amazon.com/Stalker-August-Cruz/dp/1544745982/ref=tmm_pap_title_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1503336210&amp;sr=8-1
