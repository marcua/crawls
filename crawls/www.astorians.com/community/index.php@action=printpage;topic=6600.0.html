				Contrary&nbsp; to &#039;popular&#039; belief and misreporting, some on purpose, of many in the NY/L.A.&nbsp; and&nbsp; even so-called&nbsp; &#039;alternative&#039; press, surge&nbsp; appears&nbsp; to be&nbsp; working. Al Qaida in&nbsp; Iraq, which&nbsp; was allowed to exist&nbsp; even under Saddam, and radical groups&nbsp; supported&nbsp; by Iran are repsonsible for&nbsp; the majority of&nbsp; tens of thousands of Iraqi deaths and the Iraqis&nbsp; are fed up. They&nbsp; are pleased we have not cut and run like we did&nbsp; in 1991, and leave&nbsp; them to Saddam. Our brave&nbsp; men and women are doing the right thing, and hopefully will complete their mission soon and&nbsp; come home. <br /><br />Baghdad tribes close to fighting al-Qaida<br /><br /><br />By Zeke Minaya, Stars and Stripes<br />Mideast edition, Monday, May 21, 2007<br /><br />TAJI, Iraq — Mirroring a nationwide trend, tribes near Baghdad are on the verge of banding together against al-Qaida and have met with U.S. military officials seeking aid and guidance in fighting the terrorist network.<br /><br />Acceptance of — if not outright support for — al-Qaida among the tribes eroded after the strict Islamic law imposed by insurgents clashed with the authority of the sheikhs, according to U.S. military officials.<br /><br />On Saturday, a group of local chieftains met with military commanders and a representative of the State Department at Camp Taji, about 20 miles northwest of Baghdad, and tentatively agreed to form a council that would oversee the creation of a provincial security force similar to the tribal militia created in western Iraq.<br /><br />“I think we all agree that our common enemy are extremists and that’s who we must defeat,” Col. Paul E. Funk II said to the roughly dozen sheikhs at the gathering. Funk, commander of the 1st “Ironhorse” Brigade Combat Tam, 1st Cavalry Division, presided over the meeting.<br /><br />With the fledgling alliance still in its early stages, the gathering at times resembled a negotiation. Several sheikhs asked for improvements in water treatment and electricity service as well as for inquiries into the detention by Iraqi security forces of relatives and tribal members.<br /><br />“Are you going to support us, or do we have to go knock on someone else’s door,” one sheikh asked.<br /><br />But even while U.S. commanders courted tribal support, they were wary of creating a new, separate fighting force and potentially further complicating the crowded battlefield around Baghdad that includes not only al-Qaida, but also Shiite militias.<br /><br />“We are not here to build another militia,” Funk said. Volunteers from the tribes must cooperate with the Iraqi government’s security forces, he said.<br /><br />The fragile, emerging alliance is being handled carefully by the military. No photographs were allowed at Saturday’s meeting, a nod toward security concerns and possible retaliation against the sheikhs.<br /><br />Lt. Col. Kurt Pinkerton, who commands the 2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry Regiment in Abu Ghraib, has been on the forefront of the military’s outreach to the tribes in the area. He said that the turning point in the struggle for the sympathies of the region came last September when al-Qaida in Iraq declared the establishment of the Islamic State of Iraq.<br /><br />The shadow government clashed with the centuries old tribal system, establishing Islamic sharia courts and often punishing dissention with kidnappings and death sentences.<br /><br />“Throughout history the tribes have been seen as a challenge and have been targeted. At one point Saddam tried to put them down, al-Qaeda tried, and now we need to keep the coalition from making the same mistakes,” Pinkerton said. “If you understand the [tribal] culture, you can understand the country better. Why not use tribal influence to meet your goals and objectives?”<br /><br />Tribes in western and northern Iraq have previously joined together to battle al-Qaida.<br /><br />The al-Anbar Revolutionaries have claimed to have killed dozens of insurgents, while after a meeting in the northern city of Hawijah near Kirkuk earlier this year, tribal heads and other community leaders issued a “declaration” against al-Qaida.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />http://stripes.com/article.asp?section=104&amp;article=53633&amp;archive=true (http://stripes.com/article.asp?section=104&amp;article=53633&amp;archive=true)

				Yesterday, I had an exterminator come by due to some issues in my backyard. &nbsp;He is a Marine just back from a tour of duty. &nbsp;He is proud of what he is doing over there, but is saddened and not at all optimistic about an end to the fighting. &nbsp;He was forthright in saying that we will be there for the next twenty or thirty years. &nbsp;He laughed when I asked him about the &#039;Green Zone&#039; and says that this is only reserved for the &#039;upper echelons&#039; and his experience was on the streets of Baghdad and Falluja. &nbsp;Honestly, I was hoping he would say something that would give me some faith that things are getting better, but there was no indication from him that this thing is going to work. &nbsp;I thanked him for his duty (we often forget to do that), and he then went on to tell me that when they get back, they have to fight tooth and nail for their benefits. &nbsp;This depressed him even more than his experience in Iraq. &nbsp;He says it is &#039;simply not worth it at the end&#039;. &nbsp;<br /><br />Just to clarify, I was vehemently opposed to the war and very leary of how to speak to a Marine, but I just asked him some simple questions and he was direct and forthright. &nbsp;I was hoping that he would say something positive, but nothing came forth. &nbsp;<br /><br />For those of you who think that Liberals take joy in the misery of our soldiers and worsening conditions, you are greatly mistaken.<br /><br />This war was a mistake from the beginning, and we need to come to terms with that, make some bold decisions and move on.

				Though I do not mind the copyright issue, I agree with Harlan that the big, long cut and paste is poor form and it inhibits discussion.&nbsp; Just post the link.<br /><br />Give a Vietnam War primer a read, even one written by a pro-vietnam war writer (though a generation of self reflection weeded most of them out) you won&#039;t be able to get through the introduction without seeing the gross similarities between the two conflicts and there was no way we were ever winning that little bad boy.<br /><br />&quot;we&#039;re fighting communism over there so we do not have to fight it over here.&quot;

				Hey FZ, if the surge is working then why is this http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/meast/07/08/iraq.main/index.html (http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/meast/07/08/iraq.main/index.html) happening?<br /><br />What about this http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L07597694.htm (http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L07597694.htm)&nbsp; ?<br /><br />Why do you people the propaganda compiled by the U.S. government(sic)? To me it is exactly like the propaganda made by the Nazis during WWII to make the world believe that there was nothing wrong or happening negatively in what they were doing in their control of Europe. Unfortunately that won&#039;t happen here this time. The rest of the world knows that the current administration are a bunch of despotic control freaks who think that everyone needs &quot;democracy&quot;. Unfortunately it is Dubyas version of democracy, not the ones that Founding Fathers had in minds when they wrote the Constitution and the Declaration of Independance.<br /><br />&nbsp; I hope that your conscience is clear since it is going to be chock full of guilt for a long time to come.<br /><br /><br />p.s.- Since most Americans seem to have forgotten that we are also in Afghanistan (not that they can point to it on a map), here are a few links to interesting happenings<br /><br />http://news.independent.co.uk/world/middle_east/article570217.ece (http://news.independent.co.uk/world/middle_east/article570217.ece)&nbsp; http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,,2121346,00.html (http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,,2121346,00.html)&nbsp; Here is one that I think you&#039;ll call &quot;biased&quot; http://www.projectcensored.org/newsflash/impeach.htm (http://www.projectcensored.org/newsflash/impeach.htm)<br /><br />Too bad it&#039;s all real truth, not real lies like Bush-wacker.

				War is hell...everyone can agree on that. I took the initiative of talking to a Vietnam vet about the troop surge in Iraq, and even he thinks it&#039;s pointless. Just taking another 20,000 mothers and fathers away from their family for 12-15 months, provided they don&#039;t come home in a box. Shoot, he thinks the whole war is pointless...but be that as it may, he says if you&#039;re going to be cocksure enough to go into a war like we did...YOU DON&#039;T FIGHT IT WITH YOUR HANDS TIED BEHIND YOUR BACK in the interest of political correctness.<br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong, I hate strife as much as the next peaceful man but at the same time...it puzzles me as to why &quot;Chairborne Division&quot; brass are hell bent on creating and enforcing &quot;Rules of Engagement&quot;...many of which I have been told are nothing short of ludicrous and which I am sure contribute to our guys getting killed. People who haven&#039;t been in a battle CANNOT fathom that it&#039;s not the movies. Things that may seem appalling and injust to the anti-troop yuppies are sometimes just a way of life on the battlefield. <br /><br />I find it almost funny how NATO and the &quot;Chairborne&quot; individuals are the first to outlaw &quot;inhumane&quot; weaponry. Let&#039;s look at napalm and flecchetes from Vietnam for a second. Both have been outlawed as &quot;inhumane&quot; because they&#039;re not a pretty weapon to use. They are devastating and gruesome...but by that same token...do you really think a terrorist is going to think twice to drop napalm or flecchetes on YOU if he had some? <br /><br />I feel if you REALLY MUST fight a war and use violence...you should only do it to defend yourself. And NEVER let &quot;Chairborne&quot; decide what weapons can and cannot be used. Let the guys actually FIGHTING tell you what they need to get the job done, and GIVE IT to them!<br /><br />It is pretty ironic how the &quot;domino theory&quot; from 40 years ago is back in full swing.<br /><br />1965-1973: &quot;If we don&#039;t stop communism from taking over this tiny SUB-3rd world nation, then WHAT&#039;S TO STOP THEM from spreading it all over the world?!&quot;<br /><br />Fast forward:<br /><br />2003-????: &quot;If we don&#039;t stop terrorism from taking over this SUB-3rd world nation, then WHAT&#039;S TO STOP THEM from spreading it all over the world?&quot;<br /><br />We really should learn to mind our own business in the world, and stop trying to be &quot;WorldCops&quot; :police:. However noble that cause may be, take a look around you! This country has MORE THAN ENOUGH problems that we oughta be dealing with before worrying about <span class="bbc_u">ANY </span> place else. Moral fiber has gone down the toilet, the nuclear family is in a meltdown, and you&#039;ve got an estimated 12 million undocumented illegal immigrants inside your borders. There&#039;s NO TELLING how many of those 12 million are carrying strange diseases, criminal records, or anarchistic ideals from the poor nations they came from. The old mantra rings true: The rich keep getting richer, and the poor keep getting poorer...all stressing the shrinking middle class. You&#039;re either a &quot;have&quot;, or a &quot;have-not&quot;...very hard to be a &quot;have-enough&quot; these days...<br />

				I agree about the public apathy thing. I&#039;m trying to figure out why this would be, and I&#039;m wondering if things like online forums and blogs have something to do with it. Because we&#039;re obviously not apathetic, but if the extent to which one responds to this sort of thing is to have a discussion about it on a blog or a message board while doing other things in the meantime, that could end up pre-empting any &quot;actual&quot; response from happening. <br /><br />You don&#039;t need to go anywhere to express your opinion about it; you can just post about it on the internet. In the past, in order to express yourself to a meaningful number of people you had to go to public gatherings, which would probably make protests much more likely to happen. But we can just sit on our asses and work our usual jobs and do our usual things while getting out all our feelings about what&#039;s going on.. and I think that is a big reason why hardly anyone bothers to do anything about it anymore. That and we can read some editorials about it in the paper, and maybe someone will write a letter in response. <br /><br />We can all hate the things Bush says and does, but what does he care if the most visible response he gets is a bunch of angry threads on the internet, and a few smatterings of people standing on street corners in the suburbs telling people to honk if they want the troops to come home? The way we express our opinions about this does not encourage action at all.<br /><br />That said, I do believe Bush is stupid, and I also believe he is evil and so are most of the people who serve immediately beneath him. It has nothing to do with being a &quot;leftist&quot; as I think you would find that, due to his approval rating being so low, leftists and rightists alike share this opinion. The fact that this government is allowed to continue as it has is due to both citizen inaction and the sheer amount of power the Bush administration has managed to accumulate since he took office.

				Your definition is interesting, however, this is how Webster defines &#039;Leftist&#039; -<br /><br />1 : the principles and views of the left; also : the movement embodying these principles<br />2 : advocacy of or adherence to the doctrines of the left <br /><br />So, based on this, are the principles of the &#039;Left&#039; to use the word &#039;Stupid&#039;???&nbsp; I think not.&nbsp; You need to study the principles of the &#039;Left&#039; a bit more.&nbsp; Your definition is just that - your definition.

				Chris Rock: Bush did some things you could never get away with at your job. When Bush started his job, there was a budget surplus. Now there&#039;s like a $70 trillion deficit. Now just imagine you worked at the Gap. You&#039;re closing out your register and it&#039;s $70 trillion short. The average person would get in trouble for that. Then he started a war? Now just imagine you worked at the Gap. You&#039;re $70 trillion behind on your register and you start a war with Banana Republic because you know they&#039;re selling better tank tops than you. So now you&#039;ve got employees bleeding all over the khakis. Then you finally take over Banana Republic and you find out they never made tank tops in the first place. <br /><br /><br />HA HA!

				Folks, let&#039;s be careful about how we label people.&nbsp; A Leftist may be different from a Liberal.&nbsp; I knew a number of Leftists in my lifetime, and they are very serious about their political views, very well read and do not use words like &#039;stupid&#039; or &#039;idiot&#039;.&nbsp; Think about the Leftists who hung out in the Village in the 20&#039;s.&nbsp; They did not sit around calling people stupid.&nbsp; The people that I knew (and still know a few) read Marx and had very serious discussions.&nbsp; They spent their time philosophising and certainly did not throw out random comments.&nbsp; Their words tend to be measured.&nbsp; Do you really know hard core &#039;Leftists&#039;?&nbsp; If you do, they are probably on some government list.&nbsp; Those are the folks I am talking about.

				<br />July 12th, 2007 <br />Metroland<br />The War Report<br /><br />Interview by David King<br /><br />&#039;Kirsten Gillibrand has no chance.&quot; That was the consensus around this time last year. Gillibrand was facing an election district that had a majority of registered Republicans, and many thought that a woman who ran on reforming Congress and bringing an end to the war in Iraq would be soundly defeated by the incumbent. It&#039;s a year later, and much has changed. Gillibrand (D-Greenport) has been in office for half a year. The country as a whole, including the 20th Congressional District, seems to have become more and more disdainful of the Bush administration&#039;s handling of the war. And in the next election cycle, many say, Republicans everywhere will face a steep climb thanks to President George Bush&#039;s dismal poll ratings. Despite all those changes, one thing has stayed the same. America is still at war in Iraq. <br /><br />On July 7, Gillibrand returned from a weeklong trip to the Middle East as a member of the Armed Services Committee, a trip that included visits in Iraq and Pakistan. In a one-on-one phone interview with Metroland, Gillibrand described her trip and explained how it will affect her policymaking. <br /><br />What sense did you get from the troops you were able to speak to? <br /><br />The troops in Iraq are incredibly brave and incredibly strong. They work every day in a war zone. It is very intense for them; they are young guys, and every mission they are sent on, whether they are on a convoy with supplies or tracking Al Qaeda, they are taking their lives into their own hands every day. It is incredible, and they inspire me because they are so dedicated and focused on their mission. In terms of politics, they don&#039;t talk about the politics of it. In Kuwait, waiting in line, one soldier said to me, &quot;Do what you can do to get us out of here. It is hard to see what progress is being made. I&#039;ve been here for a long time.&quot; I asked a number of troops what kind of an impact the debate back home was having on them. And they replied, <strong>&quot;Oh, ma&#039;am, we&#039;re in uniform. We don&#039;t talk about politics, but we appreciate the raise and what you are trying to do to reduce our rotation schedule.&quot; <br />A number of soldiers said, &quot;We will complete any mission you give us.&quot;</strong> And they will do it bravely, strongly, and with unparalleled commitment. They look to Congress and the administration for policy. But the debate does not undermine them or make them feel bad. You talk to the older guys, the generals, and they have a broader perspective. I spoke to a commander in special ops and he told me, &quot;We killed 10 members of Al Qaeda; let us stay the course. We are making progress.&quot; They see progress, but they are not looking at geopolitical issues and whether or not this is the best approach for undermining terrorism. Another general told me, &quot;You know, the debate in Washington is having an impact. What is happening now is Iraqis are realizing they have to take things into their own hands and make a decision to create stability in their region.&quot;<br />In the Anbar province, tribal leaders have expelled Al Qaeda in their region. They don&#039;t want what Al Qaeda are selling. They like their modern lifestyle, they like their lives how they are living them now. From my perspective, that is a key step in undermining terrorism. It will take the Iraqi people themselves to reject terrorism, to choose stability over civil war, and those are the benchmarks we are creating.<br />&nbsp;<br />What is life like for people in Iraq? What do they have to look forward to? <br /><br />Iraq today is a very unstable and unsafe place. We took a military plane into Iraq, and we had to file down into the airport. If you don&#039;t, you will be exposed to rocket fire and grenades. We took a Blackhawk helicopter into the Green Zone, and we were incredibly vulnerable to attacks. Any terrorist with a shoulder-fired missile could have taken it down. That is the situation our soldiers live in every day. On that helicopter, we went to the embassy, and two rockets were fired on the embassy while we were there having the meeting. Attacks are happening every minute of every day. And when they say there is success in the Anbar province, success there is instead of 50 attacks in one week there are 10. It will be a very long time before it is safe. <br />The real focus of American policy should be economic growth, political progress and a diplomatic effort. That is where we can make a difference. We have to bring the parties together. Young Iraqis have to have jobs to go to. That is going to bring about a much more hopeful result. When they are buildings roads and hospitals, they will choose peace over civil war. They will realize, &quot;I have a job. I&#039;m providing for my family; I don&#039;t want to be in a 20-year civil war.&quot; And they will have hope for their own future. <br /><br />During your campaign, you insisted that we would need to give Iraqis a stake in their country&#039;s oil to ensure they had an incentive to work together. Is that still possible? <br /><br />Having a job and having oil revenues are important to make sure the Iraqis have a real stake in their country. It is still troubling to me that 50 percent of oil revenues are still on the black market. We need to take the oil production and secure it, and give each group a certain stake. Right now they are trying to change the Iraqi constitution so that 80 percent of oil wells will be run by foreign entities. It would be a huge mistake. It is being debated in Iraq right now, and people are standing up against it. They realize that that kind of arrangement will have a destabilizing impact. When the country&#039;s greatest resources are given away to foreign entities, it takes away the carrots you have. <br /><br />Were you able to speak with any Iraqi citizens?<br /><br />The only meeting I was able to have was at the embassy, where I was able to meet with some women who received microfinance loans and started small businesses. They were seamstresses and involved in fabric-making. Some were in food production. They received $1,500, and they provided real hope for the communities because they could provide for their families. It was very inspiring, and the women were urging America to support these kind of efforts. It was clear that they make an enormous difference. <br /><br />What was the purpose of your trip to Pakistan?<br /><br />We went to Pakistan to assess what we are doing to undermine terrorism there. We met with the ambassador. We met with the military community. We met with the prime minister [Shaukat Aziz]. One of the things the prime minister said I thought was very powerful, he said it is the humanitarian work we are doing that is going to make a difference. He said that empty bellies are the targets for terrorism. What he meant is the greatest targets they have are people who are very poor, with a lack of hope, with a lack of future. Pakistan is very important; it shares a border with Afghanistan. That border is where refugees of the war [the Afghanis] had with the Soviet Union are, and those camps are very poor. And the Pakistani government believes Al Qaeda does recruiting there. They asked us to increase funding for education and health care, and the prime minister said he wanted to work with us militarily to track down Al Qaeda. And they are looking for our assistance economically. <br /><br />Your trip to Afghanistan was canceled. Did you get a chance to gauge the severity of the situation in that country while in Pakistan?<br /><br />We couldn&#039;t make it there because there were operations going on there, and they could not guarantee our safety. But Pakistan is very concerned about its porous borders. In particular, it&#039;s concerned about the Taliban and Al Qaeda. It really highlighted for me how broad anti-terrorism needs to be in this decade. We have to go after root causes: lack of hope, lack of a future, extreme poverty. Those are areas where organizations like Al Qaeda thrive. It really highlighted for me that the investments we need to make in Afghanistan and Pakistan are not military ones but much more focused on economic and social issues. <br /><br />You have said in the past that you expect more legislators from the Republican side to change their minds, and you expect to see significant legislation passed by the fall. Do you still expect that to happen? <br /><br />It&#039;s obviously a moving target, but I do see people across America really demanding a new approach by this administration. All types of areas of this country—conservative and liberal—are changing their minds, and more members will be moving away from the president&#039;s policies. I think we will see a move away from certain policies and benchmarks, away from military solutions and toward political ones. I think come this fall—and even sooner—bills may not pass the House, but we will come closer to the 218 votes needed.<br />&nbsp;<br />You have made a point to keep an open-door policy with your constituents and have kept up a busy schedule of Congress on Your Corner events. Have you noticed a change in your constituents&#039; feelings about the war? <br /><br />I talked to my neighbor this morning. He is a conservative Republican from my district, and he does not think this war is making a difference. He is concerned it is the wrong approach. He is concerned about the administration losing its way—and not just over the war but with the Scooter Libby trial as well. But that&#039;s just his anecdotal response. <br />Over the last two years, it&#039;s changed. At first folks wanted to give the administration an opportunity to pursue its policy. But there have been so many scandals, and they have undermined their confidence. The Libby scandal, the U.S. attorneys scandal—people are losing confidence in the administration. I see it even among my veteran advisory-board members. They really want forceful debate and advocacy for something different. <br /><br />You have stated that you believe the way to change things in Iraq is to put pressure on the administration. With Bush being so notoriously stubborn, and his poll ratings being as low as they are, does he really have anything to lose or a reason to change? Do you still think it can work? <br /><br />I do. Look at the number of Republicans last week who defected, and it is evident that the pressure is working. We are making a case to the American people that his approach is not the best. When senior Republicans start defecting, you are watching that pressure being effective. I think it is possible that we will have a significant troop reduction by the end of the administration, if not a withdrawal, and I think they will be shifting toward economic solutions. <br /><br />We all have an idea of what it is like in Iraq, whether we have been there or not. How did the reality of what&#039;s going on in Iraq compare with your expectations? <br /><br />It is far worse than I ever imagined it would be. It is so unstable. There are so many threats, and my admiration for our troops grew exponentially. They are so focused on completing the mission their commanders give them. You can&#039;t imagine how proud I was for their strength and courage. Before we went to Iraq, we went to Ramstein Air Base in Germany. Wounded soldiers are brought there before they are brought home. I met two guys who were in critical care. One was hit in the neck by a sniper&#039;s bullet and the other had shrapnel all over his body from an IED explosion. I learned so much on this trip about our soldiers and their sacrifice.<br />
