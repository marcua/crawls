				I don&#039;t know if this is a common service or not, but I have a Hoover vacuum that is broken but still under warranty. The thing works, but a plastic piece that supports the brush snapped off, so I can only use it with the belt undone or the brush spins against the inside and creates a burning plastic smell. <br /><br />I went to the Hoover website to look up service locations, and I saw there&#039;s a place called Meg Vacuum Stores on Broadway and 38th, so any input on them or any other repair place you&#039;ve used would be helpful.

				I used them some years back (probably 7 or 8 years ago) and was satisfied. My vacuum, not under warranty, was fixed perfectly and I still use it to this day.

				We used the Broadway place last year.&nbsp; UGH!!!<br /><br />first it cost around $70<br /><br />Immediately after we brought it home it was broken again.&nbsp; I think it got used once in between (maybe)&nbsp; <br /><br />It was a broken belt that had just been replaced. <br /><br />So we brought it back and the guy insisted that it was our fault.&nbsp; <br /><br />After some <em>discussion</em> he said he&#039;d give us 1 replacement belt on the house. <br /><br />If you have another option.&nbsp; Use it. <br />

				Was it $70 and under warranty or no? I was also wondering how that works, like do you pay the store for labor or would Hoover cover that if it&#039;s under warranty?

				Oh - sorry <br />No - it wasn&#039;t a Hoover and there was no warranty.<br /><br />So I guess this isnt&#039; much help. <br /><br />&nbsp;

One of them is Broadway Vacuum, and the other does sewing machines &amp; vacuum cleaners and I don&#039;t remember the name of it. Which one did you use? (I have bought parts at both, but I don&#039;t have any experience with repairs at either one.)<br /><br />There was also a vacuum cleaner place on Steinway, near and on the same side of the street as Mombar and Ali&#039;s Kabab Cafe. But I don&#039;t have any experience with them.

				I just dropped my sewing machine off at the vacuum and sewing machine repair place on the north side of Broadway this afternoon. (It&#039;s closer to Steinway than the other one, which is on the south side of the street) I liked that the place was tidy, and while I was waiting the owner took a call from someone asking if he could repair a beard trimmer and he said No. It may sound dumb, but I love a shop where they know their limits and don&#039;t say &quot;Well, bring it in, let me look at it and charge you a looking-at -it -fee.&quot;<br /><br />Nothing else to offer, but I&#039;d chance it if I were you. Good luck!

				That&#039;s Meg&#039;s, the Hoover-authorized place, and I&#039;m very satisfied with them.&nbsp; (I have a Hoover.)
