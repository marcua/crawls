				I am not looking for anything ornate or complicated, and I want to keep the price low.&nbsp; I simply need a 40&quot; x 27&quot; inch plain black metal frame for an art print.&nbsp; Dragging one back from Manhattan via subway is not something I want to do - I&#39;d rather carry it home from a place here in Astoria...

				I just went to Astoria Art &amp; Framing, a recommendation found on one of those links shared by a previous poster.&nbsp; It&#39;s listed as being on 35-04 30th Ave but I think I had to snoop around a little to find it because the address was slightly off... it is on 30th Avenue, though.&nbsp; I went there to get a gift framed just before the holidays.&nbsp; The man there was very nice and they did a professional job.&nbsp; I ended up going with a slightly pricier option than usual because of the importance of the gift but they have some reasonable options there if you don&#39;t want to spend too much money.&nbsp; Also, if you pay in cash you don&#39;t have to pay tax.&nbsp; He asked me to put down a deposit which was deducted from the total price.&nbsp; I was very happy with their work and plan on going again when I have something special to get framed.

				Hi,<br /><br />If you have not found a frame already you might want to check out American Frames.&nbsp; They&#39;re on the web and have many inexpensive frames in different styles and colors. The web site is fabulous!&nbsp; You can upload photos of your art and try out different frames on it.&nbsp; They even have a feature where you can &quot;paint&quot; the wall behind the frame.<br /><br />I believe it&#39;s americanframe.com but you might want to do a search first.<br /><br />They will even cut plexi and backing board for you but they don&#39;t ship larger sizes.<br />Melissa Wolf<br />Executive Director<br />Women&#39;s Studio Center
