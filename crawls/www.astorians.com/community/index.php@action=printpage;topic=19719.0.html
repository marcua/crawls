				<strong>Queens Markets Open For Winter!</strong><br />Jackson Heights and Sunnyside Greenmarkets will remain open until Saturday December 18 and Sunday December 19th respectively. There is also a proposal under consideration to make Jackson Heights a year-round market. A determining factor for the farmers and for Greenmarket will be market attendance in December, so come shop, tell your neighbors and fellow Queens foodies, and let&#039;s get our borough its first year-round Greenmarket. The farmers will be there no matter snow, sleet, or chilly temps so come out and keep us company this December. Stock up on all your favorite winter veggies, as well as locally produced bread, wine, cheese, and meat for all your holiday celebrating.<br /><br /><strong>Pumpkin Composting</strong><br />Don&#039;t be haunted by dead Halloween jack-o-lanterns or bury them in the landfill. Let them rest in peace at our compost drop-off events. The following Queens Markets will be accepting Pumpkins and yard debris, including leaves, for composting. Western Queens Compost Initiative (http://www.facebook.com/wqnscompost) in conjunction with Project LeafDrop (http://nycleaves.org/) will be accepting yard waste and pumpkins for compost and will turn them into beautiful soil for next seasons neighborhood community gardens.<br /><br /><div align="center">Long Island City Greenmarket<br />Vernon Blvd. and 48th Ave<br />Wednesday, November 3 &amp; 10, 8am -10am<br />http://www.grownyc.org/hunterspointlicgreenmarket<br /><br />Sunnyside Greenmarket<br />Skillman Ave and 48th Street<br />Saturday, November 6 &amp; 13, 8am - 12pm<br />http://www.grownyc.org/sunnysidegreenmarket<br /><br />Jackson Heights Greenmarket<br />34th Avenue and 78th Street<br />Sunday November 7, 10am - 2pm<br />* Author Reba Linkler will be reading and signing her new children&#039;s book Compost Heroes (http://compostheroes.com/)<br />http://www.grownyc.org/jacksonheightsgreenmarket</div><br /><strong>Turkey Time!</strong><br />Hard to believe Thanksgiving is right around the corner!
