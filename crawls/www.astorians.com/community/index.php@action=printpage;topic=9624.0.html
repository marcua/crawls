				Actually Daisy a comedy night out is not a bad idea - and we did come out and support them after the chalk controversey. It&#039;s just that for a mixer - most of us would be so chatty and that would be rude to the comics, or we wouldn&#039;t be able to chat and mix.

It seems that the last few Saturdays are hit-or-miss for them and that, since we&#039;ve talked to the management, we just need to give them an idea of how many people are coming sometime next week. (That&#039;s why the list is the awesome!)<br /><br />Also, I would totally go for schmancy wear if others were going to too.<br />

It looks it on the website- but I have gone there several times in jeans and a sweater and didn&#039;t feel uncomfortable at all. Its weird because it does look really swanky online. Its a nice space, nicely decorated and all the food I have had there was good. <br /><br />Enjoy- I wish I could join you all but I will be visting my folks that weekend.

				Hey all, I just wanted to let you guys know that they will have food and I told them we&#039;d be showing up around 8 and that I didn&#039;t know how long we&#039;d be there. Also, I&#039;d suggest everyone bring cash to help in divvying up of the bill.

				If you watch the radar or check weather.com you will see that all of the rain has passed and it is 0% chance of precipitation for the rest of the night. No more monsoon.<br /><br />http://www.weather.com/weather/hourbyhour/11106?from=36hr_topnav_undeclared<br /><br />I&#039;ll be there.

				Sorry, I didn&#039;t make it.&nbsp; I was out all day and had planned to go straight there, but then one of my plans got cancelled, and I ended up with too much downtime before the party.&nbsp; Then we had a monsoon, and I heard the wind, and the hermit inside took over.&nbsp; I took out the PJs and watched Volver.&nbsp; Sorry about that!&nbsp; Bad weather often dictates my social life, and that wind sounded horrible!!&nbsp; The news said to stay inside for fear of flying debris and downed trees, and I listened.&nbsp; Yup, I&#039;m lame.

				Sorry to disappoint you!!&nbsp; Well, I was at comedy night at Mezzo Mezzo the night before, so I wasn&#039;t completely hermitesque this weekend...&nbsp; But it was right after work, so I went straight there.&nbsp; I know the disappointment you speak of, my organizing the comedy night was a big one.&nbsp; &nbsp;But it did turn out to be a blast and my friends and I enjoyed it.&nbsp; The comedians were really great.&nbsp; <br /><br />I could be talked into going to Dillingers this Tuesday for wings though....&nbsp; We could talk animation there?

				I&#039;m sorry I missed it!&nbsp; My husband is getting over the flu, so I opted for making him some homemade soup (like a good little wifey) and watching a movie on TV.&nbsp; We hope to make it out to meet our neighbors soon!

				After hearing that wind I knew I&#039;d end up sick if I went out and I can&#039;t afford to get sick now.<br /><br />Will correct this next time.
