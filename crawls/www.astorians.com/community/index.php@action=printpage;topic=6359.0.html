				In another great move in political correctness and freedom of&nbsp; speech - Opie and Anthony are suspended from XM Radio ! For comments by a caller regarding Condoleeza Rice! This is just great. If you thought the Patriot Act is bad enough for our dwindling rights, the politically correct crowd is only furthering cause. <br /><br />It will be interesting to watch, because as we speak the phone lines to XM are flooded with subscription cancellations. Watch the stock drop.<br /><br />Every other week now - a broadcaster goes down - Imus, JV and Elvis, and now Opie and Anthony. Who&#039;s&nbsp; next ?<br />Soon we will turn on the radio and there will nothing but static.<br /><br />Remarkably Rush Limbaugh survives despite his felony plea and other offenses. <br /><br /><br />

				XM suspends Opie and Anthony for 30 days<br /><br />By MATTHEW BARAKAT, Associated Press Writer 1 hour, 32 minutes ago<br /><br />McLEAN, Va. - XM Satellite Radio suspended shock jocks Opie and Anthony for 30 days Tuesday, one week after they aired crude sex comments about<br />Condoleezza Rice, Laura Bush and Queen Elizabeth II and one day after they made light of the incident in their broadcast.<br /><br />&quot;Comments made by Opie and Anthony on yesterday&#039;s broadcast put into question whether they appreciate the seriousness of the matter,&quot; Washington-based XM said in a statement. &quot;The management of XM Radio decided to suspend Opie and Anthony to make clear that our on-air talent must take seriously the responsibility that creative freedom requires of them.&quot;<br /><br />Opie and Anthony, who last week apologized for the sex comments, struck a more defensive tone on Monday&#039;s broadcast. They lamented the state of radio and what they perceived as excessive reactions to comments made by themselves and other radio disc jockeys.<br /><br />&quot;We&#039;re under the same scrutiny as (National Public Radio) â€” it doesn&#039;t make sense,&quot; they said on Monday&#039;s show.<br /><br />The pair also expressed sympathy for Don Imus, saying his career is now &quot;gone, just because he was trying to entertain people.&quot;<br /><br />Last month, cable network MSNBC dropped its simulcast of Imus&#039; show, then CBS Radio fired him for using racist and sexist terms to describe the Rutgers women&#039;s basketball team.<br /><br />On May 9, Opie and Anthony, whose full names are Greg &quot;Opie&quot; Hughes and Anthony Cumia, aired a segment with a man they call Homeless Charlie. As the names of Rice, Bush and the queen came up, Charlie said in vulgar terms that he would like to have sex with each of them.<br /><br />Opie and Anthony laughed as they imagined Rice&#039;s &quot;horror&quot; while describing a violent sexual encounter in which Rice is punched in the face.<br /><br />Opie and Anthony were fired by CBS Radio in 2002 after broadcasting a call from two listeners who said they were having sex in New York&#039;s St. Patrick&#039;s Cathedral.<br /><br />XM hired the pair in 2004. Because the show airs on satellite radio, its content is not subject to regulation by the<br />Federal Communications Commission.<br /><br />Opie and Anthony also host a syndicated, tamer terrestrial radio program for CBS. Opie and Anthony will be on the air for that program as scheduled Wednesday morning, CBS Radio said Tuesday.<br /><br />A call to Opie and Anthony&#039;s agent, Robert Eatman, was not immediately returned Tuesday.<br /><br />A spokesman for XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc. declined to say whether Opie and Anthony would be paid during their suspension, calling it a contractual matter.<br /><br />

				The Patriot Act&nbsp; has not dwindled&nbsp; my rights. However, the&nbsp; PC crowd, usually on the Left, but, joined&nbsp; by some&nbsp; on&nbsp; the Right, have been trying for decades&nbsp; to stop free speech. The Fairness doctrine made sure&nbsp; so-called &#039;right-wingers&#039; were not on the air&nbsp; alone, and was&nbsp; correctly removed. If anything, from Al Gores&nbsp; wife and the PMRC&nbsp; of decade&nbsp; or so ago and Sharpton today, Free speech&nbsp; is usually under attack by those&nbsp; who claim to speak for&nbsp; tolerance and free speech.

				FZ, you are of course right to your opinion, but please get your facts rights. &quot;Free speech&quot; describes the constitutional right that prevents the government from restricting speech in most circumstances. Here, the government had nothing to do with anything. These yahoos were suspended by their employer, XM radio, for embarrassing them. Your rights are not in jeopardy here.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=6359.msg73669.html#msg73669">Quote from: FZ on May 16, 2007, 02:16:27 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The Patriot Act&nbsp; has not dwindled&nbsp; my rights.

				How much of an effect does this vanilla political correctness have on the arts &amp; entertainment?&nbsp; How many literary works, paintings, sculptures which we presently catagorize as innovative masterpieces were considered obscene and sick-minded when they were first produced?&nbsp; What type of stultifying effect might this have?&nbsp; Ought we just ready ourselves to be content with PAX televsion and soccer mom approved radio? <br /><br />A society gets the entertainment it deserves.&nbsp;

				And by the way, the reason why I had a problem with what was going on with Howard Stern was because the FCC, led by Michael Powell, Colin&#039;s son, was fining Howard for his speech.&nbsp; This, unlike Imus or Opie &amp; Anthony, involved the government censoring a private entity.&nbsp; You could make the argument that the same sort of censorship scared corporate executives into preemptively striking at offending jocks, but I really didn&#039;t see the FCC fining Imus for what he said. <br />

				Xm wants to (needs to)&nbsp; merge with Sirius. They need FCC and other government approval. The last thing Corporate wanted was anything upsetting the power elite.<br />In the present post - Imus millieu - evreyone&#039;s walking on egg shells, and XM, IMHO overeacted and loss of their subscription base and consequent stock drop will portend their demise.

As far as&nbsp; Opie and Otis or whatever that show is, as a Republican and suppoter&nbsp; of&nbsp; Rice, I hated it of course, but, FZ or anyone&nbsp; else&nbsp; should not have the Govt&nbsp; &nbsp;step&nbsp; in here.&nbsp;

				Here we are a couple of weeks later, and Free-FM is no more.&nbsp; Put back in place K-Rock 2.2 circa 2005 (as the first Krock in the early 90&#039;s was more oldies Rock and Stern, then later 90&#039;s through 2005 was more modern day rock with the odd rock classic thrown in).&nbsp; And the beloved (WoW) O&amp;A keep their terrestrial radio jobs while waiting for the 30-day suspension at XM to be over (if ever).&nbsp; Meanwhile, the rest of the Free-FM roster (Nick DiPalo, RadioChick, Ron &amp; Fez) are thrown to the bottom of the talk radio hovel.&nbsp; The most likely result of any time spent in radio, at one time or another, is being fired when the station you&#039;re on goes in another direction.&nbsp; Saddest for me, even after Ron &amp; Fez turned in a fairly strong (#2 in their male demographic) Arbitron in their evening timeslot, out the door they go&nbsp; :x.<br /><br />- Cannibal<br />Radio is still my first love.&nbsp; Too bad they don&#039;t do it anymore over at WBAI...
