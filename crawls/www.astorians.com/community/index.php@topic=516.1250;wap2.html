			Hi!<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve been in Astoria for five years now, and I&#039;ve love every minute of it! I&#039;m actually part of some local civic groups, including the Long Island City Alliance. If you&#039;ve got any concerns about local issues, e.g. parks, sanitation, traffic, etc., let me know - we&#039;re always looking to do more!

I&#039;m Clive, my wife and I just recently moved here in Astoria from Austin about a week ago and we have been enjoying our stay here so far. I have actually been following most of the threads here months before when moving here was still uncertain but now that we&#039;re here, I decided that it&#039;s time to join and become a member.&nbsp; Anyway, there are still a lot to experience here in Astoria and we&#039;re both very very excited about it.&nbsp;

			Haha, I&#039;m not going to say OK. I&#039;m just saying &quot;Hello, everyone!&quot;<br />I&#039;m Cocoli and I just joined here a moment ago. I&#039;m 27 years old and I work as a designer in Chicago now. But my uncle has been lived in Astoria for years. Astoria has my wonderful childhood memories. So very thanks for my uncle&#039;s caring. I&#039;m an optimistic, passionate, easygoing and aspiration woman. I like reading, photography, singing and traveling in my spare time. However, fashion design is my favourite. I&#039;m really intersted in studying fashionable products like clothes and apparel. And some inspiration from the common occasion really makes me excited. So if you&#039;re a fashion lover, welcome!&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />Thank you!
