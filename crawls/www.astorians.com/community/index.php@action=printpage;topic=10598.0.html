				I&#039;m surprised nobody has posted about this place yet. I guess they opened on Thursday (took the place of another Indian restaurant that I never went to. They are <em>not</em> the same owners). It&#039;s on 34th St., right off of 30th.<br /><br />Really excellent food. We had the chicken samosas, chicken vindaloo, and chicken korma. Everything was very tasty, and the nan was the best I&#039;ve had. I would very much recommend checking it out. They also said they would deliver to Ditmars, which was a nice surprise.<br /><br />Oh god, and I just realized they have online ordering on their website (http://www.sevaindianrestaurant.com/cafeseva/cafeseva.aspx), so I&#039;m totally in love.

				i&#039;m a little disoriented at the moment...is this restaurant where Mengha (i think that&#039;s how it&#039;s spelled) is/was?&nbsp; Have you been to Ghandi and if so, how would you compare the food to them?<br /><br />Thanks.

				Looks nice.&nbsp; I tried ordering online after seeing this post, but they either don&#039;t really have it up and going, or my order got lost in cyberspace.&nbsp; I always liked Meghna more than Ganhdi, it was just better quality food.&nbsp; The website looks nice, but there is no email to inquire about orders and when you register, it doesn&#039;t send you a confirmation of your registration.&nbsp; I suspect it&#039;s something they&#039;ll have in the future, but don&#039;t have up yet.

				I had Seva last night for dinner and then some left-overs for lunch today.&nbsp; LOVED it!!&nbsp; Great deal, they gave us the lunch special even though it was supposed to end at 3 and we got there at 3:30.&nbsp; ($8 for soup, main course, rice and a can of soda.&nbsp; So we had chicken tikka massala, chicken saag, and a veggie dish (cauliflower, potato, peas).&nbsp; It was all really good.&nbsp; I think my favorite was the chicken saag.<br /><br />and my stance on the Meghna - Seva comparison... Meghna was just okay, but Seva is kind of awesome.<br /><br />Also, we did take out, but there was a sign saying it was BYOB and the inside was really nice.

				We ordered from Seva a while back.&nbsp; A rather large order and big assortment of menu items.&nbsp; Everything was so delicious that we called back just to tell them.&nbsp; The owner answered and was very humble and happy we called.&nbsp; Said they had a restaurant in New Jersey but were giving Astoria a shot.&nbsp; We recommend it to anyone who likes Indian food.&nbsp; Roti Boti is also pretty good but more like fast food for the cabbies than Seva.&nbsp; But nonetheless, Roti Boti has tripled it&#039;s space and is remodeling to be much more &quot;fancy&quot; than before.&nbsp; We&#039;ve also had the food at the place on Broadway&nbsp; - maybe across from Bakeway.&nbsp; Is that this Meghna place?&nbsp; If so, Seva is much better.&nbsp; That was good and delivery was reliable, but the food at Seva is just much better.

				I tried Seva on Sunday night.&nbsp; Mixed review.&nbsp; I got take-out so I can&#039;t comment on service.<br /><br />The slightly unusual dishes on the menu caught my eye, and I knew anything would be better than Meghna (the biryani I got there was the blandest food I&#039;ve ever eaten.&nbsp; good riddance to that s&amp;^%hole).&nbsp; <br /><br />The appetizer (crab cake) was terrible.&nbsp; It was imitation crab meat, and not billed as such.&nbsp; Unforgivable.&nbsp; And no detectable Indian seasoning.&nbsp; They threw in a chicken samosa without charging me, perhaps to forestall disappointment with the crab cake.&nbsp; The samosa was average.<br /><br />Main course (green chili chicken) was delicious.&nbsp; I have an unsophisticated palate but I could tell there was a lot going on in that sauce.&nbsp; The complexity reminded me of Kalustyan&#039;s Curry Leaf restaurants, in a good way.&nbsp; The whole green chilis in the dish allowed me to control the spiciness.&nbsp; (hint: there were no leftover peppers.)<br /><br />Very nice naan.&nbsp; Buttered.&nbsp; They gave me LOTS of rice, the leftovers of which I&#039;ll eat tonight.<br /><br />I&#039;ll definitely try them again.&nbsp; I&#039;ll skip appetizers completely (seriously, do NOT order the crab cake) and try the vindaloo.&nbsp; Got to try their biryani, too.<br /><br />They&#039;re definitely making an effort, which is more than I can say for Meghna.

				It is the old Meghna space, and it&#039;s much prettier - they really made it look nice.&nbsp; I had dinner there last night and the food is good, the portions generous.&nbsp; It&#039;s a nice addition to the neighborhood.&nbsp; Despite there only being three tables of people, the service was very slow and haphazard.&nbsp; They may be working out some of the opening kinks, but it was really very slow and a bit weird (bread arriving at the end of the meal, um, thanks, but no thanks? - it was nice bread, but you need it with the entrees).

				Went last night, as far as the food goes, I was very satisfied.&nbsp; I really liked that there were items on the menu I&#039;d never seen before; bok choy pakora, green chili chicken, etc.&nbsp; The shortened review - We had the pakoras, green chili chicken, saag paneer, mulligatawny, rice and nan.&nbsp; All was really tasty and well seasoned. The mulligatawny was rich and smooth, nan (on time for us) was buttery, and the bok choy pakoras were light and crispy.&nbsp; Entrees were very good, although I&#039;ve been spoiled with the saag paneer from Mina&#039;s in Woodside, I would order both again.<br /><br />Our service was a little slow but nothing crazy and the owner(?) noticed and repeatedly apologized. I will <span class="bbc_u">definitely </span>be back. <br /><br />They had lots of covers for a Wednesday - the power of astorians.com perhaps?

				Just wanted to add my own thumbs up for Seva.&nbsp; I&#039;ve eaten there twice so far and really enjoyed the food both times.&nbsp; For my tastes it&#039;s better than Gandhi and much better than the old Meghna.&nbsp; Service was quick and friendly so they may have worked out some of the kinks that earlier posters mentioned.&nbsp; I just hope that they can keep up the quality of the food as the place becomes more popular.

				Another good review for Seva! We went on Sunday afternoon, got the bok choi pakoras, the bhel puri, the malai kofta, and sesame naan. The pakoras were really good, with two excellent sauces. The bhel puri was strange but strangely compelling; the only complaint is that one order serves 4-6 people! The malai kofta was (according to my GF, who claims to be a conaisseur of this dish), particularly good, with nice rich flavors. And the sesame naan was just the right mix of salty and oily and toasted. Friendly service too, and a pleasant space. Definitely worth a trip from anywhere in the neighborhood!

				I ordered in from Seva last week.&nbsp; I went with an old standby, Chicken Tikka Masala.&nbsp; I found it to be very rich and flavorful, but if I remember correctly, I don&#039;t believe it&#039;s suppose to be overly spicy.&nbsp; This was SPICY and more tomato-y than I&#039;m usually use to.&nbsp; So, it was very good, but next time I would request it more on the mild side and I would absolutely love it if it had more cream in it.&nbsp; <br /><br />I also ordered the garlic naan.&nbsp; It was heavenly!

				Yeah that garlic nan is amazing!&nbsp; Huge chunks of garlic just waiting to be devoured.&nbsp; So good.&nbsp; I tried Seva the other day.&nbsp; We ordered the prix fix for $12 each, and walked out with a bill of $46 and food to take home.&nbsp; I tried the lamb spring roll which was very tasty and crispy.&nbsp; The samosas were good too.&nbsp; They gave us 2 extra because the food took a long time to prepare and I think they felt bad about the wait.&nbsp; The Green Chili was very spicy, and the Chicken Saag as awesome.&nbsp; The dessert dough ball in honey was pretty cool too, although we were very full at the point.

				yum! i like this place a lot, though I didn&#039;t try very many menu items.&nbsp; I got Malai Kofta, vegetable samosas, and a sweet lassi.&nbsp; Samosas were very tasty, although the dark brown sauce that usually comes with samosas wasn&#039;t as good as some other places I&#039;ve tried (i&#039;m big on condiments).&nbsp; but considering that the samosa itself was crispy on the outside, delicious on the inside, it didn&#039;t really matter.&nbsp; not too doughy, either--that&#039;s key.<br /><br />My serving of malai kofta was massive! as in, I got three meals out of it.&nbsp; Usually you only get two little vegetable croquettes and some sauce, but with this there were four vegetable croquettes, and a ton of sauce!&nbsp; and it was like $8.&nbsp; that&#039;s a steal at twice the price. It wasn&#039;t the BEST malai kofta I&#039;ve had, but it was yummy.<br /><br />and finally, the lassi.&nbsp; The clincher.&nbsp; if it&#039;s a bad lassi, count me out.&nbsp; this, however, was sweet without being too sweet.&nbsp; Good consistency too.<br /><br />I got take out, and the ladies at the counter were super nice.&nbsp; I obviously need to try more items (will go with friends next time and share--am dying to try the chicken tikka), but I really enjoyed my meal.&nbsp;

				I love this place-- also, you can ask for how spicy etc. you want things to be which has made me like it even more. I can spend $8 and often that will last me more than one meal. The family that owns it is very nice. Definitely check it out.

				I feel like I&#039;m pretty spoiled when it comes to Indian seeing as I just moved to Astoria a few months ago from Woodside on the border of Jackson Heights so my basis of comparison is Jackson Diner and the like. Seva is good but could be better. It&#039;s the best I&#039;ve found in Astoria so far (I&#039;m not a fan of Roti Boti, their Jackson Heights location is way better). The garlic naan is not garlicky at all, I was convinced it was regular naan. The tikka masala was pretty good, not the best, but good. The samosas were good too. I thought overall it lacked spice. The chutney was strange, kind of watery and bland. Their rice pudding was really lame. I will not order that again. The portions here are great and the prices are awesome. I think overall it&#039;s good but not great. I still drive over to Jackson Diner and get takeout once in awhile though.

				FYI: I tried to order off their website and the order didn&#039;t go through, I had to call them. The food is OK, but I thought it was bland. They were out of naan when I ordered too. How can an Indian joint be out of naan? That&#039;s like a diner being out of fries.<br /><br />For the price you pay, you do get a lot of food. Their entrees are like $4 cheaper than Ghandi&#039;s.

				I had the chicken curry a few weeks ago. It was pretty good (altho a bit diff in terms of the curry taste than a few other places I have tried when I lived in Manhattan, etc.).&nbsp; I also got the Peshwari Naan (naan with fruit and nuts) which needed a bit more fruit but was pretty decent as well. I concur you get a TON of food for the price. The rice lasted me THREE meals, the bread and chicken 2.&nbsp; I had a place that was kinda under the radar that I used to order from and loved when I lived on the UES so I was sad with all the great food out here, Astoria was lacking in Indian (I hadn&#039;t tried the other 2 places which were always hotly debated on here but talk of roaches always skeeved me out a bit).&nbsp; Overall, i think this place is good, esp for the price and considering Astoria isn&#039;t an Indian food hotbed so do recommend it.

				i had another fantastic seva experience yesterday.<br /><br />my sister and i went for a late lunch/ early dinner so we were the only ones in there.&nbsp; they brought us free stuff to try and were super nice.&nbsp; the veggie and chicken samosas were awesome.&nbsp; i had the chicken saag again,&nbsp; :mrgreen:, and my sister had the green chilli chicken, which was a little bit too spicy for me, but still delicious.<br /><br />for dessert we had this almondy, honey-y dumpling, (sorry, forgot the name!) and it was also great.&nbsp;

				i tried Seva and liked it alot, my only problem is that i found the food to lack a certain spice that i wanted.&nbsp; It could just be what i ordered, but i expect my chick pea curry (i think it is called saag paneer) to be spicy, and this was not.&nbsp; It was very tasty, but not spicy. <br /><br />Has anyone asked for the restaurant to make their food on the spicy side?&nbsp; i am always worried that if i do this they will make it insanely spicy.<br /><br />That being said i thought the food was very good.

				My friends and I tried Seva for the first time on Saturday. Compared to other Indian joints in Astoria - I was impressed. <br /><br />The Vindaloo (Lamb) was near perfect (lots of sauce for Naan dipping). Incredibly spicey (effects reamining day after - a good sign). I do wish, however, that there would have been more lamb and potatoes. The service was great. The price is right. <br /><br />Before I give it my A+ - I need to try it another time or two (and order take-out). I can&#039;t remember if they deliver (if so, I&#039;m going to try this too).

				I went there last night for dinner and we got the prix fix deal. The food and service was excellent (I got the lamb vindaloo, they asked if I wanted it medium or spicy, I said spicy - however I&#039;d say it came out medium, but still very tasty), but I&#039;m confused as to all the posts about the large size of the portions. They seemed very normal to small sized. Was it because we got the prix fix?<br /><br />I&#039;m definitely going to be ordering from them for delivery in the future. Probably not the prix fix if that&#039;s the case.

				I went back last week for more take-out.&nbsp; Bypassed the appetizers and ordered lamb vindaloo and a side of dal.&nbsp; The vindaloo sauce was VERY delicious, as complex as the green chili dish I&#039;d ordered last time; not as spicy as I&#039;d hoped but spicier than most NYC Indian places will make it.&nbsp; The lamb was kind of tough, but flavorful.&nbsp; I&#039;ll probably stick with chicken next time, or try one of their shrimp or fish curries.&nbsp; The dal was the most delicious dal I&#039;d ever tasted.&nbsp; They put a couple pieces of tomato in it, but they were easily removed and they&#039;d kept their structural integrity rather than leeching their tomato-iness into the dal.&nbsp; If you&#039;re accustomed to the bland, I&#039;ll-eat-this-because-it&#039;s-legumes-and-it&#039;s-good-for-me dal that most places serve, you&#039;ll be surprised.<br /><br />So I was happy with it again.&nbsp; And on my way out I ran into Leah, so that was another plus.

				My boyfriend and I had an odd Seva delivery incident on Friday night that&#039;s worth mentioning.&nbsp; We ordered our meals around 8pm and about an hour later we get a call from the restaurant.&nbsp; They wanted to know if we enjoyed our meal.&nbsp; I told them we haven&#039;t even received it yet.&nbsp; They quickly said, &quot;Oh, it&#039;ll be there in ten minutes,&quot; and hung up before I could say anything.&nbsp; 15-20 minutes go by and there still wasn&#039;t any food so I call up.&nbsp; After talking with a couple of confused people there, I finally spoke to someone who confessed that they delivered our food to the wrong address and that they were making our order now and it would arrive shortly.&nbsp; And they profusely apologized.&nbsp; It really didn&#039;t phase me at all and we shrugged it off.&nbsp; But when the delivery guy did come he told us that the meal was on the house for the mess up.&nbsp; That shocked us a little bit and we have him a large tip for his trouble.&nbsp; And that was that.&nbsp; But then 10 mins later he comes back with a meal receipt/ticket and asked us to pay.&nbsp; I have no idea what was going on.&nbsp; I guess I&#039;m chalking-it-up to a huge amount of miscommunication.<br /><br />But hey, we did notice that they gave us an extra order of samosas for free.&nbsp; So, that was nice.

				Meg - I must have just missed you guys!&nbsp; I got there around 8:45 for dinner last night.<br /><br />I had high hopes for the lamb vindaloo myself, as it&#039;s probably my favourite dish (well, goat vindaloo is my favourite dish, but it&#039;s harder to find).&nbsp; I&#039;ve only ever had it once where it was spicy enough for me - as in knock your socks off-make your head sweat-stun you with its complexity that shines through the heat.&nbsp; Last night at Seva I asked the waiter to have them make it truly, really spicy.&nbsp; While it tasted good and the lamb was tender, I was truly, really disappointed in the spice level.&nbsp; It had some heat, but what I would consider average.&nbsp; I told them I was disappointed, and they offered me hot sauce.&nbsp; What they initially brought wasn&#039;t any hotter.&nbsp; I sent that back and they made it hotter finally -- but it still didn&#039;t make my scalp sweat.&nbsp; That&#039;s what I was looking for. <br /><br />Of the appetizers I tried, I liked the bhel puri and the chicken malai kebab very much.&nbsp; I also liked the taste I had of mulligatawny, but as gfb noted a while ago, the crab cakes were subpar - and not very Indian-tasting to me.&nbsp; The chicken malai kebab had a very nice heat level.&nbsp; We also all really liked the sesame naan.<br /><br />Service was lacking, although our waiter was pleasant enough.&nbsp; It was incredibly slow, and they told us it was because they had a lot of delivery orders.&nbsp; I can understand if they had just fired a bunch of orders initially, but the pace of deliveries clearly slowed and we didn&#039;t get our food any quicker.&nbsp; At this point, we were the only table seated in the restaurant.&nbsp; They brought the appetizers out one at a time, with minutes passing between each dish.&nbsp; We waited an inordinately long time for our entrees, and when we finally caught our waiter&#039;s eye and asked what was going on, the waiter said, oh, you were busy talking so I was waiting to serve you.&nbsp; ??? We all found that to be a really bizarre statement.&nbsp; He said the food was ready in the kitchen, but it still took 5-10 minutes for the dishes to start coming out after that.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would like to try other dishes there, particularly the green chili chicken, and I really want to push them on the heat levels.&nbsp; Don&#039;t get me wrong - I&#039;m glad they can adjust the heat level for those who prefer it less spicy.&nbsp; But given what I&#039;ve read on this thread, I was surprised at how timid the vindaloo was since I ordered it spicy.&nbsp;

				Yeah, Lanseaux, my BF and I also experienced the same slow as a snail service. We entered at about 4 PM on a weekday. The waiter was in the midst of a conversation with someone (the ONLY other person in the restaurant) about the difference between India and Pakistan. We said hi, sat down---and waited patiently, quietly. My BF asked for menus after a few minutes and the waiter said &quot;First I have to bring you glass of water.&quot; He brings two glasses of water with small white particles floating in them and goes off to continue his conversation. We look at the water, then at each other, thinking: if the water is this clean-imagine the food. Long story short- we wimped out, said sorry we have to leave and never had the chance to try the green chili chicken or anything else all of you have been raving about. We&#039;re both kinda paranoid, I guess.<br /><br />We&#039;ll probably try again...maybe

				I hope it sticks around too- and yes there isnt anyone ever there! I went with a friend awhile back on a fri nite- only one other couple there.&nbsp; i Have become somewhat of an addict- went twice in 8 days- hahaha- but I used to live on the UES where there was a great Indian place and I missed good Indian grub.<br />If you are watching your waistline- they use very little ghee in their cooking and they have this dish that I love called Chana Saag. Its basically spinach with ginger. I actually am not a big spinach fan but if u eat sag paneer u will love it but ALOT less fattening and spicy. Its probably the most diet friendly thing u can eat. Chicken Tandoori is also good as is green chili chicken. My bro had the lamb vindaloo and it wasn&#039;t spicy enough. The paratha is the best!<br />I also like that they are BYOB- saves money. Three of us ate for $35 incl appys. U cant beat that!<br />

				I had Seva for the first time last night.&nbsp; I ordered in Chana Masala and Vegy Samosa, and they were both very good.&nbsp; I&#039;d prefer the Chana Masala a little less tomatoey but since the chick peas were cooked to the right tenderness and the spices were well balanced, I&#039;m happy.&nbsp; The Veg Samosa was flavorful with an excellent mush/crunch factor and as un-greasy as a fried thing can be.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m a vegetarian&nbsp; not a vegan, but I prefer not to eat the Indian cream and cheese, so I really appreciate that they identify vegan choices from among their vegetarian options.&nbsp; That&#039;s very cool.

				I am so excited for Seva! Finally some GOOD indian in Astoria!! I almost licked the bowl of tikka masala sauce clean! Plus, it looked like they had some unique things on the menu that I haven&#039;t seen at other places, and some interesting nan - like the sesame and a fruit and nut nan. I can&#039;t wait to go and try some new dishes ;)

				We got a delivery Monday and it was definitely delish (as Rachel would say). This is far and above what one would expect. For example, our Mulligatawny soup had a hint of coconut milk. And, as I ate the chicken biriyani, i crunched up a cardamon pod. That, beyond anything else, is proof of the authentic food at Seva.<br /><br />No matter where you live in Astoria, give this place a try.

				Last Friday I had veg. samosas, (as good as Pineapple suggested, and pretty big too.&nbsp; We had some sort of potato patty in a pool of yummy sauce, the name of which escapes me now. And lamb saag.&nbsp; The flavors of spinach, lamb, and spices were very well balanced.<br /><br />My gf is stuck in a tandoori chicken rut. She was less excited than me, preferring Ghandi&#039;s version of that dish.<br /><br />I am eager to try the chicken tika masala.&nbsp; When Megna first opened in that space, their&#039;s was to die for. Then at some point they changed chefs, and lost the formula. Plank&#039;s got me hoping that these guys found it.

				Finally tried it. We did the delivery special and then got an order of naan and an order of paratha to go with it. I got the chicken samosas as my appetizer and we both really enjoyed them. I&#039;d never had samosa before but decided to go that route based on the thread; it wiill probably be my appetizer of choice from now on! Husband got the mulligatawny soup - neither of us particularly cared for it. We bought found it rather bland and I found the texture of the soup odd, too. Having never had mulligatawny soup before I don&#039;t know if it is supposed to taste kind of murky? I guess, but I didn&#039;t care for that. I got the lamb curry as my entree and he got lamb vindaloo - both delicious. Hubby remarked that the spice level was right where he wanted and the flavors in both were great. The paratha was airier and thicker than I&#039;m used to, but both that and the naan served their purposes well. We both got the kheer as dessert. I liked it a lot but sadly only managed a few bites because I was already so full. I&#039;m looking forward to finishing it off later, though! Overall, will definitely be ordering from Seva again and I look forward to trying out the other dishes recommended on this thread. Oh, and delivery took about 45 minutes.

				I&#039;m sorry to report that I had a horrible delivery experience recently with them.&nbsp; Over an hour and a half to deliver my food.&nbsp; It seems there was a screw up, although they would not say what was the problem.&nbsp; I had to call twice.&nbsp; It was awful.&nbsp; The delivery go was very apologetic but the woman on the phone seemed to not want to let me know what was happening other than to say the food was coming soon.&nbsp; I have heard other people have had delivery issues with them so a word to the wise, if your food is not there after half an hour....call to see if there is a problem or when u call, ask them how long deliver will take.<br /><br />The food is super yummy though.

				Went to the restaurant and did the lunch special the other day. Glad to report the mulligatawny soup actually had flavor this time, though it was pretty much just lentil and chicken broth. I would have preferred a bit more spice to the soup - I thought the flavorings were just a tad too subtle. My lamb korma was great. Had the rosemary naan as well and will probably stick with other variations - rosemary was too dry and didn&#039;t add a lot of flavor. My lunch companions very much enjoyed their fennel chicken curry and lamb saag lunch specials. The portions were quite large as well - we all ended up taking half our food home including half of one order of naan. Great deal all around.

				I just ordered the delivery special; 1: Chicken Samosa 2 :Chicken Tikka Masala 3 :Gulab Jamun. It was good better than most places for the $. However, I ordered from Ghandi last week and their Chicken Tikka Masala wasn&#039;t as bad as everyone is making it out to be. In fact you get what you pay for. At Ghandi&#039;s I received a lot more Chicken in my dinner even though the container it comes in looks smaller than the container that Seva gives you. Seva&#039;s sauce for the masala is a lot thicker but it is a bit tastier. Ghandi&#039;s was definitely flavorful just not as much. However, I like the sauce a little thinner and therefore Ghandi&#039;s was pretty good. The garlic naan at both were equal in flavor and texture. As for the Chicken Simosa and Gulab Jamun they were good but I only ordered the Masala at both places as a comparison. I would definitely order from either place again. Some days restaurants are either on or off, so we will see.

				Just ate at Seva last night, Thursday, April 9 at 8:00PM.<br /><br />This is the first positive review that I&#039;m writing since I&#039;ve eaten here.&nbsp; That&#039;s not to say that this is the only good restaurant in this area.&nbsp; It&#039;s just that this is the first new restaurant I&#039;ve been to since I&#039;ve moved in the area where it&#039;s been a great experience.&nbsp; Here we go:<br /><br />We ordered a tandoori mixed grill, lamb saag, and an aloo mottor gobi (potato and cauliflower) with a naan.&nbsp; The total was $33.&nbsp; It was a relatively quiet dinner service.<br /><br />First off, I immediately noticed that it was mostly women there, so at first I was a little hesitant.&nbsp; I was one of only two men all night.&nbsp; Because most women I know don&#039;t really go to places &quot;for the food,&quot; it&#039;s more about the atmosphere, I was thinking already that I wouldn&#039;t like this place.&nbsp; But as I looked around, I was wondering to myself <em>really?&nbsp; what atmosphere?</em>&nbsp; That&#039;s not to say that the place doesn&#039;t have atmosphere, it&#039;s just very standard Indian restauranty, so it&#039;s not like a clubbing scene to find guys.<br /><br />But on second look, I realized that there was a table with a young, attractive girl eating by herself.&nbsp; There was a group of women who weren&#039;t anorexic enjoying themselves and gorging on a lot of food.&nbsp; There was a couple sitting next to us having a great time.&nbsp; Two women came in and did take out.&nbsp; And all of the women looked like they knew how to enjoy themselves.&nbsp; And that&#039;s when I realized it.&nbsp; This place isn&#039;t for women, it&#039;s for foodies!&nbsp; At that single moment, even before our order had arrived, I was happy.&nbsp; All of a sudden, all of the women looked a lot more attractive to me (I&#039;m married, so I&#039;m speaking from a purely platonic sense, if that&#039;s possible) AND the restaurant looked that much more attractive as well.<br /><br />In terms of food, it had a full-bodied flavor with a lot of spices going on.&nbsp; They were not subtle about a lot of the spicing and it was really a &quot;big flavor&quot; place.&nbsp; All the dishes were actually spicy, and in this case, I mean spicy hot, which is AMAZING.&nbsp; My wife complained that it was on the verge of being too hot, but it was just right for me.&nbsp; The tandoori was moist served with sliced onion and green pepper and raita, and the saag had a not-so-subtle kick in your face of ginger and green chilis.&nbsp; The aloo gobi was bathed in a hearty curry.&nbsp; The naan was light and crispy.&nbsp; The basmati was spiced with fennel.&nbsp; And, for the first time in my life (I never thought I&#039;d ever say this about Indian), it wasn&#039;t greasy.&nbsp; WHAT?!&nbsp; Yeah, you read it right.&nbsp; It&#039;s Indian food that isn&#039;t greasy!&nbsp; WOW.&nbsp; That made the experience that much better.<br /><br />My wife and I suddenly started debating how this place stacks up to our favorite Indian places.&nbsp; As it turns out, we both agree that while it&#039;s not as good as Kabob King in Jackson Heights or Banjara in East Village, it&#039;s right up there with Ghandi Cafe on Bleecker Street (not to be confused with Ghandi Cafe on Broadway).&nbsp; So although it&#039;s not top top tier, it&#039;s a solid low top tier restaurant, which is really good in my book.&nbsp; And for $33, it&#039;s a steal.<br /><br />Portions: Portions were decent, not a lot, but enough.&nbsp; Indian food tends to sit heavy anyway, so you really don&#039;t want a behemoth mound of it.&nbsp; You want enough to satisfy without overwhelming, and Seva pulled that off.<br /><br />Value: It&#039;s value dining.&nbsp; This is my favorite kind.&nbsp; It&#039;s not cheap eats but it&#039;s not mediocre greasy food either.&nbsp; It&#039;s high quality food for a mediocre price, a price totally justifiable and worth every penny.<br /><br />Food: A- (lots of flavor, spicy, not greasy)<br />Portions: B (no complaints)<br />Value: A (good food at $10 an entree)<br />Recommend: Yes, I&#039;d recommend this place any day of the week.&nbsp; This place is definitely all about the food, something I really appreciate.

				Riteus,&nbsp; glad to hear there&#039;s another fellow fan of Seva (mmmm...we may just have to order that in tonight), but I do have to say that your generalization of women and their preference for atmosphere is more than a bit odd.&nbsp; There are foodies and there are scene/atmosphere people (as well as the mix) but I don&#039;t think they&#039;re split down gender lines.&nbsp; I think food is the great gender equalizer.&nbsp; &nbsp;:mrgreen:

				Yeah, what&#039;s up with that? I don&#039;t frequent the trendy places just for the atmosphere; the food is always the main concern. <br /><br />I&#039;m usually chowing down at the crowded little falafel place, or the street cart, or the crappy-looking bagel place, maybe the &quot;old-timer&quot; Dunkin&#039; Donuts chatting with one of the regulars about betting the horses (he was nice and probably bored!)

				I think I&#039;m going to order Seva this Wednesday - haven&#039;t had Indian in awhile and all the local places near my work are terrible. Not spicy, not tasty, smaller portions than Seva and pricier - even their stupid lunch specials are more expensive than Seva&#039;s normal dinner prices! Stupid, stupid Manhattan.<br /><br />On a side note, riteus made a mistake and he&#039;s sorry. You can stop harping on him now. All he really said was that most women that he knows (which may be true, I don&#039;t know who he hangs around with) don&#039;t care much about food and care more about atmosphere and decor. And that the women at Seva were clearly of a higher caliber. I&#039;d think his statements would only be offensive to the women that know him personally.

				You&#039;re right. It&#039;s not riteus&#039;s fault he apparently has often enjoyed the company of certain women who cause him to think most women don&#039;t give a crap about what they&#039;re eating as long as it&#039;s in a snazzy place with hot guys, to the point where seeing a large percentage of women in a nondescript looking restaurant that serves good food turns his entire world perspective <em>upside-down</em>. Not to mention the idea that anyone who finds his perception of most women to be offensive or bizarre is an angry feminist.<br /><br />Welcome to Astoria, where we have women who like eating delicious food at restaurants!

				Uhh...thanks for the backup, guys.&nbsp; I really thought I was going to be stoned.&nbsp; Seriously, my statements weren&#039;t made to offend, rather it was just a compliment.&nbsp; I guess it turned out to be a backhanded compliment, which was not my intention.<br /><br />Also, to put things in context, not only did I move here from Manhattan (and have been living in Manhattan for 10+ years), but I lived most of those years in Soho.&nbsp; My colleagues and classmates predominantly ended up in investment banking, consulting, and law (I&#039;m none of the above) and they tended to crowd around the chicy scene at places that served $20 vodka sodas (Meatpacking District, Turtle Bay, Chelsea, Soho, Tribeca).&nbsp; The women there are a much different breed than the women here.&nbsp; And to that end, the men are much different from the ones here as well.&nbsp; I have my own personal feelings on the hypocrisy of high-waged corporate men, but that&#039;s another topic altogether.<br /><br />I moved out to escape that scene (which I really haven&#039;t been part of for quite some time now).&nbsp; Personally, I was always much more of a dive bar and pub kind of guy.&nbsp; Again, I&#039;m happily married and run my own little startup on the side, so my comments weren&#039;t made to be interpreted as sexual advances of any kind.&nbsp; They were simply me stating how appreciative I am of my new surroundings, that&#039;s all.

				I haven&#039;t been there often enough yet to have a favorite yet (caloric restrictions and all!) But I enjoyed the lamb saag (I LOVE SAAG!) and lamb spring rolls. I&#039;m not a fan of Indian desserts in general, so I won&#039;t go there. And I didn&#039;t think their samosas were that great, but again, it&#039;s been awhile and things might have changed in the few months I&#039;ve been there. I noticed on their website that their specials are available on the weekends, so I might have to revisit. My only negative was that the service was not that great the last time I was there (group of 3) and there was no one else in the restaurant, and when my companion asked for spicy...they just couldn&#039;t quite meet that expectation. I would have to agree. Again, spicy is relative based on what you&#039;re used to, but it really wasn&#039;t spicy at all. I&#039;m now used to Poodam&#039;s version of spicy, so if it&#039;s not that hot, you&#039;ve lost me.

				Seven of us ordered take out from Seva last night - and unlike our usual Astoria gatherings - this one was not food centric so we didn&#039;t really discuss the food.&nbsp; I have NO idea what anyone thought of their food other than it was TOOOO spicy.&nbsp; I was a bit surprised after reading posts about the low spice content - but I ordered my dish mild and it was barely tolerable (for me).&nbsp; Everyone else ordered med and most complained of how spicy it was.&nbsp; And the person who ordered.... is it vindaloo?? that is supposed to be very spicy?? whatever the dish is that is supposed to be very spicy - was inedible b/c it was toooo&nbsp; hot.&nbsp; <br /><br />I thought the flavors were really good and there were a couple of other comments to that effect... but much was lost due to the spice factor.&nbsp; <br /><br />IN the meantime.... I tried the eggplant with peas dish...don&#039;t know the name - it was yummy.&nbsp; And I didn&#039;t order the spinach with cheese (chana saag?) but I ate someone&#039;s leftovers - omg... it was AWESOME.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				Tried Seva out for the first time on Sunday night and they were great.&nbsp; Had the lamb korma, which was delicious, and the kheer for dessert -- also delicious.&nbsp; Service was always genuinely friendly and mostly attentive, except towards the end when they got slammed with more guests than they had room for at the moment.&nbsp; I don&#039;t always think to go out for Indian food but I was curious to try this place out based on the recommendations I&#039;d heard.&nbsp; It didn&#039;t disappoint at all.&nbsp; I&#039;m also kind of stoked that you can order from them online and even get estimates on the earliest delivery and pickup times right off their main page:&nbsp; sevaindianrestaurant.com<br /><br />&nbsp;:-)

				My boyfriend and I have gone their regularly since they opened.&nbsp; We were glad when business picked up-as the good word obviously had gotten out.&nbsp; Good for them!&nbsp; Just really great Indian food for a great price!<br /><br />To the person that made the comment about women and atmosphere...<br /><br />Even when I was single, I NEVER went somewhere for atmosphere and NEVER went anywhere with intent to pick up men.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t care less to pick up guys.&nbsp; I go out to have fun, eat good food, drink good drinks, have great/funny conversations with friends.&nbsp; <strong>You should not generalize all women as mindless skanks that just want to be part of the &quot;scene&quot; and crave male attention</strong>.&nbsp; I actually hate when I&#039;m out and about without my boyfriend and receive some male attention.&nbsp; It&#039;s annoying.&nbsp; Some men act like they&#039;ve never seen a chick in their life.&nbsp; Stupid.&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t fond of it when I was single either.&nbsp;
