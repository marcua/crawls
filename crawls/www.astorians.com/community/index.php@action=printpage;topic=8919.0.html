				My girlfriend and I recently moved to astoria ( 30th and 31st, 30th ave stop) and we recently realized there are no movie theaters around here! We went to a place in Long island city we had to take the N/W to 36th ave stop and walk about 7 blocks to get there and it was kinda a sketchy neighborhood after midnight. One thing we noticed was that there was not one person that walked to the subway from the theater (we were the only 2 on the platform) which led us to think maybe there is a closer theater in astoria or does everyone just go out to the city to go to the movies???

				That&#039;s the only movie theatre in Astoria.&nbsp; The other one on 30th Avenue and Steinway closed down several years ago.<br /><br />As far as safety - I&#039;ve never felt ill at ease walking home from that theatre at all hours.

				We walk to the movie theater from the 36th St. stop all the time. The only sketchy part is that one block right before the theater, but I think it looks sketchier than it actually is. <br /><br />The only thing to worry about at that theater is all the brain-damaged parents who bring their small children to R-rated movies. I hate those people so much.

				We must live near each other - that&#039;s my stop too. My boyfriend and I regularly go to that <br />theatre. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a big trip at all - about 15 minutes total for the two stops on the<br />train and the quick walk. <br /><br />But yes, that is the only one in the area.<br /><br />I go to the movies often and do go in the city as well. The easiest one to get to are the two<br />on 42nd Street - the AMC and the Regal E-walk. They&#039;re directly across the street from each<br />other on 42nd between 7th &amp; 8th. Just take the last, rear car of the train and get off at Times<br />Square. Go up and walk around by where the number 1 train and exit there. They&#039;re both just up<br />the block.<br /><br />Total travel time is about 25 minutes.

				There is also the R train stop at Steinway, which is about an avenue and a block away.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s closer than the NW but maybe not by much.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never thought of that area as unsafe.&nbsp; But I do see it as Astoria&#039;s little slice of Times Square, what with Applebees and Uno&#039;s right next to each other.&nbsp; That theatre is nice, but just like Times Square AMC and Ewok, has become a hangout for teens who haven&#039;t nothing better to do all day.&nbsp; Since we have no local mall, I guess it&#039;s a good default.&nbsp; I did the same thing when I was a teen, it hasn&#039;t changed much.&nbsp; Cept I grew up.&nbsp;

				It really isn&#039;t sketchy, (it just kinda looks that way depending on how you get there...) besides... movies premiere there... Spiderman 3 comes to mind and that last Tom Cruise dealie. I can definitely say I&#039;ve been to way less safe theatres in way more safe districts.<br /><br />It&#039;s not the best theatre in the world, but it&#039;s safe enough.

				Well actually, there is also the AMMI nearby as well. Granted it isn&#039;t the same as the Kaufman theatre, but there are still movies shown there http://www.movingimage.us/site/site.php (http://www.movingimage.us/site/site.php)<br /><br />And the area isn&#039;t sketchy, just like other areas, there aren&#039;t always people walking about.

				We walk to the theater and I second that that only sketchy thing going on around that theater is parents who choose to bring liitle kids to totally inappropriate movies.&nbsp; Can&#039;t find a sitter??? Stay home or take the kids to a G or PG movie.&nbsp; Drives me NUTS!!!!!

We won&#039;t go there anymore since the last time we went ( I forgot which movie it was that we saw there) there was so much talking we couldn&#039;t even focus on the movie and missed half of the dialogue. ( it wasn&#039;t one of those shoot-em-up types of films.) So from now on we go into Manhattan.

				I think the timing and movie choice more than the movie theatre determine how awful your crowd is.&nbsp; I really try to steer clear of Saturday night movies anywhere, as the crowds are always atrocious and act so as well.<br /><br />I go to a lot of early matinees, or late-night films when I want to see something that would appeal to kids (Harry Potter, for example).&nbsp; For cult movies, I go early to try to catch the cult crowd; for popular movies I go later to avoid the masses.<br /><br />I&#039;ve found myself much less annoyed by people around me that way - no matter what theatre I&#039;m at.<br /><br />The occasional pointed glare also works in many circumstances (both at the movies, and in live theatre).<br /><br />I love the fact that the Kaufman Astoria almost always has the movies I want to see.&nbsp; They tend to have a good mix of new, popular releases and slightly more obscure, limited release films.

				My bad experiences at Kaufman-Astoria have happened at all hours of the day and night, weekdays and weekends, during holidays ( christian, jewish etc etc), and each time it was the same. Bunches of teens making endless noise and not shutting up when asked, mothers with their months old babies who were crying throughout the damned movies, and the usual&nbsp; idiots conversing on their cellphones as if they&#039;re in their own damn living rooms. So I&#039;d rather take the subway to Manhattan than have to put up with idiots who have nothing better to do than spend $11 talking on their cellphones.( and who think it is their RIGHT! HA!)

				Unfortunately, I haven&#039;t found many theatres here or in Manhattan where rude people don&#039;t congregate.&nbsp; AMC on 42nd and the Ewok are notorious for teen hangouts, fights, cell phone talking, and all sorts of general rudeness.&nbsp; UA on 14th and Lincoln Center are slightly better but certainly not immune.&nbsp; They should have a seat ejector button for cell phone jerks and talkers.

				I agree daisy, but that&#039;s why we prefer to go to the less mainstream theaters, like the Angelika, or Film Forum or BAM where those types of people would feel out of place ( and wouldn&#039;t go anyways to see a movie like &quot;Adams Rib&quot; or &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#039;s&quot;)

				Well, the subway will always&nbsp; rumble underneath, the floors will be sticky since people are too lazy to throw away their used drink cups. As for the sightlines, I don&#039;t know about that since I am somewhat tall and am usually not bothered by people iin front of me. And I have always preferred a smaller theatre.

				Slightly off subject, but about people talking during the movies: does anyone else get really annoyed when you read about the &quot;theater owners&quot; wondering why attendance is lower these days?&nbsp; Technology is a factor (people have kick-ass home theater systems), but cell phones and increasingly awful teenagers ruin movies for most folks.&nbsp; Personally I would go to the movies a lot more if I knew that the theater would enforce the &quot;silence is golden&quot; policy.&nbsp; They need to install cell phone jammers like they have been discussing, I&#039;ll take my chances that I won&#039;t need to call 9-1-1 in the 2 hours that I&#039;ll be in that theater.&nbsp;

				For me, it depends on the movie.&nbsp; A big stupid block-buster action movie is better with a roomful of wacky teenagers, in my opinion.&nbsp; I like the energy and the vibe of a packed house with excited people.&nbsp; For the theater in Astoria: Die Hard, yes.&nbsp; No Country for Old Men, no.&nbsp; Luckily, if the movie is even slightly &quot;artsy&quot;, no teenagers will step foot inside.&nbsp; I&#039;m not defending annoyingness in theaters but I just choose when I go and what I&#039;m going to see.

				Another plus about the AMMI - I&#039;ve been there four times for movies, and every time the crowd was very serious about their movie viewing - any talking, muttering, shuffling, bag crinkling, etc, was immediately squelched by an uproar from the majority of the crowd.&nbsp; I see this as a refreshing change, but something you should be aware of before you enter with a smuggled sandwich wrapped in deli paper, etc...

				In my experience the Times Square theaters are the worst places to see movies, followed by the 14th St theaters.&nbsp; I never wento to the big theaters at Lincoln Center, but the art cinema up there is great, and probably one of my favorite places to see movies if I want to see something in the theater.<br /><br />That said, until very recently I almost never went to see movies in the theater, and going to see Juno at KA reminded me why.&nbsp; The people talking, cell phones ringing, the jerks who show up 20 minutes into the movie and ask people to move, people walking in front of the screen.&nbsp; For $22 I can wait for Netflix to drop off a movie, order a pizza, and get a 12 pack of Yuengling (or a few bottles of wine) and have a perfect night.&nbsp; <br />

				Yuengling is probably my favorite brewery that isn&#039;t difficult to find.&nbsp; This is additionally influenced by the fact that a 12 pack is rarely more than 9.99 at Key Foods.

				I usually go to the two theaters right off the NW train at 59th street and 3rd Avenue (exit out the escalators at the back of the train if you are going into Manhattan/downtown).&nbsp; The two theatres are literally at the top of the subway exit stairs, show good films for grownups and are not usually as crowded and overwhelming as 42nd Street.&nbsp; Now, if I only knew the theatre names, that would be helpful...

				I live near the KA Regal and I love it.&nbsp; I like the sightlines and I usually get there early enough to get seats at the &quot;break&quot; with all the leg room.&nbsp; I have rarely had a problem with unruly brats.&nbsp; And fortunately nobody was idiot enough to bring kids to the midnight showing of <strong><em>Sweeney Todd</em></strong> a few weeks ago.<br /><br />The only thing I wish they would change is the long break between screenings.&nbsp; They don&#039;t need that much time to clean up the rooms; what they need is intermissions for movies that are more than 2.5 hours long!

				I&#039;m glad to see there is growing unrest about the idiots who ruin movies at K.A.&nbsp; I love having a theatre right in our backyard, but I have had showings interrupted by rude people at all times of the day and all variety of films.&nbsp; Sometimes the rude people will go to see a film that is outside of their usual genre preference and ruin it for everyone anyhow.&nbsp; Example:&nbsp; I went to see some Woody Allen movie (which I didn&#039;t like either) at K.A.&nbsp; It was a late showing.&nbsp; People were there with their crying toddlers in tow.&nbsp; The movie was boring, and they vocally commented on it.<br /><br />Once when I went to the theatre in Battery Park City, they gave me a handheld device which had keys on it that would alert theatre security if someone were talking, bootlegging the film, etc. They told me that they give that device to one random person at each film.&nbsp; I was rewarded with a free movie ticket and happy to do my duty.&nbsp; I wish Kaufman Astoria would adopt this technology.

				Yeah, the whole &quot;let&#039;s take our toddler or baby to the movies where he/she can cry and annoy everyone wanting to hear the film they paid good money to hear and enjoy&quot; thing is one of my biggest pet peeves.&nbsp; Unless it&#039;s specifically a kids G rated movie, leave the baby at home with the sitter.&nbsp; I don&#039;t need to watch Juno and hear your baby crying instead.&nbsp; It&#039;s not as if anyone can control their baby to not cry during a movie, so leave them with the sitter.

				I&#039;ve been fairly lucky with regard to this stuff, but I remember one couple a few years ago whose toddler tried running up and down the steps near his parents during a movie that wasn&#039;t appropriate for children. That is dangerous as well as otherwise irresponsible.<br /><br />People who bring infants into movies are also endangering their children&#039;s future hearing.&nbsp; Babies&#039; eardrums are not tough enough for the decibel levels for normal movies, never mind the action films.

				That is a great idea about the hand-held device. If I remember correctly, one of the<br />theatres at Battery Park - maybe the one you went to - is a Regal Kaufman, so I&#039;m surprised<br />our local theatre doesn&#039;t do this. Then again, they might end up having to give out too many<br />free tickets.<br /><br />I have to say though, my boyfriend and I regularly go to the RK usually every other Friday night.<br />I get him alternate weekends when he doesn&#039;t have visitation w/his kids. And even on an opening<br />night that&#039;s crowded, we&#039;ve never had a problem with noise, difficult people, etc. Maybe we&#039;ve<br />just been lucky or maybe it&#039;s because we tend to go to shows between 7 - 8:30 start time. <br /><br />In the city, my favorite theatre is the the AMC on 42nd. I&#039;ve been going there since they opened<br />and love the comfy seats, the huge screens and the fact that there are multiple bathrooms on<br />every floor so I don&#039;t have to wait on the long lines. <br />
