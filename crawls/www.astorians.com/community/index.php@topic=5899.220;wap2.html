			Woa...$400 for a 2 bedroom? Some astorians have said that it&#039;s actually a steal, but $2900 doesn&#039;t seem like a steal to me. It&#039;s a 1960s building, which I very much like, but it&#039;s not new construction which usually charges such rents for tiny spaces. <br /><br />I&#039;m very torn whether we should apply for the apartment. I love all aspects, but the rent frightens me. Based on the 40Xrent formula we can go for a $3500 apartment, but I think it&#039;s mad to pay that sort of rent in Queens. On the other hand, I love the idea of a balcony and a dishwasher and washer and dryer. Renting in NY with a modest rent you don&#039;t get those sort of amenities. <br /><br />I&#039;m just afraid that this will be a missed opportunity that will end up in regret. <br />

			Are u buying this condo or renting out a condo ?&nbsp; &nbsp; Im guessing u are renting it right ?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well to get all that , 2500 , is on the low end . I rent out apts in Astoria pretty much all my adult life and I can tell you if u were on ditmars , broadway or 30th ave&nbsp; ,&nbsp; &nbsp;that type of apt would be close to , if not 3k a month .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; First to get 2 queen size bedrooms,&nbsp; washer dryer&nbsp; your own laundry is huge .&nbsp; outdoor space....super huge plus a doorman ? wow&nbsp; &nbsp;.&nbsp; You would be getting a very good place for the money . Only thing is how is the neighborhood ? u said 3 blocks away from 30th ... well that&#039;s where some blocks get sketchy ,&nbsp; 34th-35th etc. Im not saying anything bad but just be aware and maybe the price reflects this .<br /><br />As far as heat ,&nbsp; more and more apts now are being converted where the tenant is paying for heat .What you use , u pay for . If you think abt it&nbsp; , it makes sense .&nbsp; &nbsp;Endless time the heat is on and no one is home .&nbsp; Windows are left open and heat goes wasted . Sometimes&nbsp; one person likes it colder&nbsp; while the other tenant likes it warmer .&nbsp; Solution , control your own heat . Electric everyone pays unless u are in a basement apt .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All new constructions are being built with separate controls and meters .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you and your husband are working most of the day , your heat would be off and&nbsp; it would only be used 6 months out of the year .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I doubt it would ever go to $400 .&nbsp; Mine has never gone over $200 but I also shut it off when its not needed (dress warm)&nbsp; &nbsp;and always off when we are out .<br /><br /><br /><br />Would I would do&nbsp; since u mentioned u can afford $3500,is either stick with the lesser rent or find a 1 bedroom in Astoria for the same price u pay now in Kew Gardens and save the rest of the would be rent money .&nbsp; Then buy that condo .&nbsp; &nbsp;U feel $2900 is too much for queens ?&nbsp; &nbsp;Well don&#039;t ,&nbsp; &nbsp;Astoria is one of the most wanted places around and plenty choose to live here over Manhattan like myself .&nbsp; Rents are always going up here and the demand is still huge . In 4-5 yrs , that price can look like a steal .&nbsp; &nbsp;BUT I really believe buying something makes a lot more sense .

The Queens waterfront is a market like no other part of Queens and that has to be realized before you can make quick judgments on price and value.

There&#039;s nothing wrong with 34th and 35th sts near 30th ave.

			I meant 34th 35th avenues.&nbsp; some of those areas depending aren&#039;t too nice looking or as safe as ditmars or 30th ave
