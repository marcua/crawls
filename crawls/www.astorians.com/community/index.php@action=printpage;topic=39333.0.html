				Astorians.com has made common practice of banning people who do not align themselves to politically correct speech so I wonder why it is they have labeled me an &quot;illegal alien&quot; in my profile? Is it common practice fot this site to insult people with such labels? What gives?

				Thats rather my point - they ban people for having conservative ideas and expressing displeasure about immigrant issues, yet they will utilize an anti-immigrant term. I am always impressed by the hypocrisy of this site&#039;s progressive webmaster: One thing is too sensitive, but another is not. It&#039;s like the head of the neighborhood cool kids club you grew up with, who just maguically made up the rules as s/he went...

				Leaving aside pc for a moment, does anyone think describing someone as &quot;illegal alien&quot; is particularly collegial&nbsp; or welcoming?&nbsp; Might as well call &#039;em &quot;derelict&quot; or &quot;homeless person&quot; which has the same degree of warmth.<br /><br />If my number of posts ever equals that of a &quot;president&quot;, I will not accept the title and I will not serve.<br /><br />cheers,<br />Interloper<br />

				<br />No one is given a warning on this site for their views, whether they are of a more conservative or liberal nature.<br /><br />Ananya, we both know that this is disingenuous and completely false.<br />I&#039;ve been censured and censored on this site many times by the moderation team. I was even taken to task one time for pointing out that a Greek landlord was Greek.<br />On other occasions, I was threatened with removal when I criticised the moderators lack of moderation and resorting to pc censorship when posts ventured outside their safety zone.<br />There is a definite reason why no one posts to this once vibrant forum anymore.&nbsp; Really only one or two posts a week? Anytime a discussion gets remotely interesting, a mod locks it down.
