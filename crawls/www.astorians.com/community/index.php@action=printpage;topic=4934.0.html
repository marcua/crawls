				An interesting article.&nbsp; Thoughts?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><strong><br />Last warning: 10 years to save world</strong><br />Jonathan Leake, Environment Editor<br /><br />Scientists say rising greenhouses gases will make climate change unstoppable in a decade<br /><br />The world has just 10 years to reverse surging greenhouse gas emissions or risk runaway climate change that could make many parts of the planet uninhabitable.<br /><br />The stark warning comes from scientists who are working on the final draft of a new report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).<br /><br />The report, due to be published this week, will draw together the work of thousands of scientists from around the world who have been studying changes in the world’s climate and predicting how they might accelerate.<br /><br />They conclude that unless mankind rapidly stabilises greenhouse gas emissions and starts reducing them, it will have little chance of keeping global warming within manageable limits.<br /><br />The results could include the destruction of the Amazon rainforest and the Great Barrier Reef, the forced migration of hundreds of millions of people from equatorial regions, and the loss of vast tracts of land under rising seas as the ice caps melt.<br /><br />In Europe the summers could become unbearably hot, especially in southern countries such as Greece, Spain and Italy, while Britain and northern Europe would face summer droughts and wet, stormy winters.<br /><br />“The next 10 years are crucial,” said Richard Betts, leader of a research team at the Met Office’s Hadley Centre for climate prediction. “In that decade we have to achieve serious reductions in carbon emissions. After that time the task becomes very much harder.” <br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />More, here (http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2089-2569944,00.html).

Yes, it&#39;s true that those countries are becoming more developed, but think of all the technology they have available to them now that hadn&#39;t existed yet when we were at that stage. I would think this is the perfect time to really push more efficient and less polluting cars, air conditioners, refrigerators, washing machines etc. to be available, so they have the choice to buy them. <br /><br />What I don&#39;t get is how people like Bush think that making industry cut emissions and use energy more efficiently would be bad for the economy. We could be coming up with all this new technology, and a bunch of new jobs could be out there if the government were actively funding and/or giving tax breaks to companies that are willing to cut back on emissions and/or develop more efficient technology. He could be giving college students incentives to major in things like engineering and science, fields that are responsible for this kind of innovation. He could be taking advantage of the situation, but instead he won&#39;t budge out of the old way of doing things and he doesn&#39;t expect anyone else to, either. Typical Bush, but it makes me sad that this is the way things are going. For example, they could put a limit on how few miles per gallon new cars can get, thus giving car companies the incentive to develop efficient new cars, which would lead to more jobs and more people buying these new more efficient cars, but no. Developing new things to sell is apparently bad for the economy. Tax cuts and lower gas prices for everyone so they can keep driving their Hummers! This is AMERICA!<br /><br />And why don&#39;t we plant some more f&#39;ing trees? Don&#39;t they consume CO2, or did the country forget learning about that in elementary school? Why isn&#39;t use of solar power more widespread?

I&#39;m not saying we&#39;re going to take some existing technology and save the world with it- but with solar power, you have power generated by something that we&#39;re not going to use up. Bush is talking about ethanol as if corn doesn&#39;t need a place to grow and we can just grow tons of it indefinitely for fuel, along with growing it for food. Unless someone figures out that using solar power robs the atmosphere of necessary UV rays or something, I don&#39;t see a reason for not finding a way to take the idea of solar power and turn it into something that <em>is</em> economically viable. Wind power too. Especially with the more severe storms we&#39;re due to get with climate change.&nbsp; :roll:<br /><br />As for the tree thing, again I&#39;m not talking about extremes. Obviously we&#39;re not going to stave off the effects of humanity on the earth by planting a forest. But if it&#39;s found that a certain type of plant absorbs a relatively large amount of CO2, and we have too much CO2 in the atmosphere as we&#39;re clearing out land to build things, it would seem to make sense to encourage that type of plant in the proper environment. Not to fix the problem altogether, but to make it at least a little less bad. This of course would take a lot of study, but it&#39;s just another idea. I wish I heard more ideas from people who actually have the power to do something about it.

She talked about the turbines being installed (http://www.verdantpower.com/initiatives/currentinit.html) in the East River that generates electricity with the tides, which will be a source of green, renewable energy. From the flyer (dated 5/2006):<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">By July [2006], a Gristedes on Roosevelt Island should be drawing power from an unusual source - a turbine under the East River being driven bythye ebb and flow of the tides. A Virginia company, Verdant Power, has received the go-ahead to place the first two of six turbines in a channel of the East River to test whether they can generate electricity efficiently without disturbing the environment. One turbine will send power to the supermaket and a nearby parking garage. The other will house monitoring equipment to gauge performance. If all goes well, four more turbines will be installed soon for an 18-month test that could lead to 200-300 of the devices.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well, the Gristedes is being powered already, and a number of volunteer groups have been formed to study the effects the turbines are having on the river, with regard to fish, birds, and recreation, to name a few. Also, they are going to see if the turbines affect sediment in the river. As of now, there is no sediment in the river because the water rushes by so quickly, but who knows if the turbines will slow things down, thereby creating sediment. Since the turbines have been put in, no fish have died as a result, which is good news (these turbines turn at 32 revolutions per minute, as opposed to conventional hydro-turbines, which turn at 600-700 rpm, so much safer). Eventually, if this test project succeeds, and all the turbines are installed, it could power 8,000-10,000 homes.<br /><br />For more info, go to http://www.verdantpower.com

				Gothamist has a short mention (http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2007/02/10/randalls_island.php) of the the Verdant Power project, plus the upcoming hybrid wind, solar and tidal-energy power plant (http://www.environmentalleader.com/?p=739) on Randall&#39;s Island:&nbsp; <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">New York City’s Department of Parks and Recreation is in final contract negotiations with Highland, NY-based Natural Currents Energy Services (http://www.e3-inc.com/website/index.asp) to build a hybrid wind, solar and tidal-energy power plant on Randall’s Island in the East River, CityLimits (http://citylimits.org/) reports.<br /><br />The facility, paid for with U.S. Department of Energy funds, will be the first hybrid plant in the five boroughs when it starts generating power in 2009.<br /><br />With the city’s overall sustainability plan due in March, the five boroughs could be on the verge of a renewable energy boom.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This, I was not aware of, but am excited to see how things work out for it.&nbsp; <br />
