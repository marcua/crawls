				I&#039;m looking to move August 1st, and I imagine you&#039;re looking for something sooner, but this looks so perfect I have to at least make an inquiry. I&#039;m looking for a place near the N/Q and you sound like someone I would get along with perfectly. Also very DIY, pretty introverted and usually only have a date/friend or two over for chill evenings, not loud unless we&#039;re listening to the same music, love going out to improv shows on the weekends, and want someone who respects space but friendly enough to chill with when we&#039;re both home. Love cooking for everyone as well. <br /><br /><br />I&#039;m a 21 yo female (prefer older roommates), working at an architecture firm in Manhattan and will be transferring to CUNY Hunter to finish part-time in the Spring. I can pay up to 750/month so this is ideal. Originally from Alaska, studying econ (entering urban studies at CUNY and will be going on to urban design), and familiar with the area. I&#039;m in queens fairly often so if you are interested I can meet up during the week. <br /><br />Best,<br />Andy

				Hey there,<br />My name is Melissa, I&#039;m twenty-four-years-old and looking to move to NYC by the end of August as I begin acting school starting the second week of September. Your budget is around the same as mine; I love cooking as well and really enjoy stand-up (my goal is to be an SNL regular one day haha) Please let me know if you&#039;re interested! =)
