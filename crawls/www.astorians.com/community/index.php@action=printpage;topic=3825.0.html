				Hello,<br /><br />I&#39;m a musician and music teacher, looking to start music classes for infants toddlers in Astoria beginning in January.&nbsp; (The program is called Music for Aardvarks and Other Mammals, and is geared toward children aged 3 months thru 5 years, incorporating a wide variety of musical activities, including singing, dancing, musical story telling, instrumental jam sessions and musical. The original material used in class uniquely reflects and celebrates the lives of children growing up in an urban environment, as well as more traditional themes universal to all children.&nbsp; The main Music for Aardvarks website is www.musicforaardvarks.com, if you&#39;d like to check out some of the songs, and an Astoria Aardvarks webite is coming soon!)<br /><br />In any case, I&#39;m wondering if anyone here has advice on a space I could rent one weekday morning per week.&nbsp; Children&#39;s play spaces seem to be difficult to find here, but a community centers, rec rooms at church or synagogue or dance studio could work.&nbsp; The main thing is that I need a child-friendly room that can accommodate 10 -12 toddlers per class, with room to dance and play with instruments.<br /><br />Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!&nbsp; Questions also welcome!&nbsp; Once I have a space, we&#39;ll be offering free trial classes, and I&#39;ll post that information here when it&#39;s available.<br /><br />Thanks so much!<br /><br />Best,<br />Allison :-)

				I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s still available but on the corner of newtown and 30th (across the street from amici amore) there is a space that is for rent. I think it&#39;s a great location being a block and a half from the train.<br />

				Hello all,<br /><br />Just writing to say that I&#39;m still seeking advice on a space for offering children&#39;s music classes.<br /><br />To clarify, I&#39;m not looking to lease a space on a monthly basis.&nbsp; Rather, I am looking for a space that will rent me a room for roughly two hours, one morning a week at an hourly rate.<br /><br />Churches, synagogues or community centers who have rec rooms that are often idle in the mornings would be ideal.&nbsp; If any of you know of such a place, your advice would be greatly appreciated!!!<br /><br />Many thanks,<br />Allison

				you can ask at st joe&#39;s church on 30th avenue and 44th street.&nbsp; Also the Yoga room on steinway might be open to an inquiry.... <br /><br />You should also know though that Music Together ( national program) already hosts classes on Ditmars and on crescent and 33rd.<br /><br />

				Yeah, I don&#39;t have specific contacts, but if you haven&#39;t already, I&#39;d just cold-call the local churches, centers, etc. <br /><br />I saw a sign at SAI Organics that they will be renting space in their new location on 30thAve/near 31st Street - I remember that it was for alternative health/spirituality practitioners, etc, and who knows what the space is - but hey, may be worth a shot.

				You could check out Bohemian Hall.&nbsp; In addition to the Beer Garden, they have a big ol&#39; building that I know has gymnastics classes on the weekends.&nbsp; You might be able to work something out with them.

				There are places all over the neighborhood that offer things like martial arts or dance classes as well as various community centers. I think just taking long walks and knocking on doors might be useful (though time consuming).&nbsp; I&#39;m thinking of the democratic hall that is next door to us (Newtown and 41st) it&#39;s empty 9/10ths of the time.&nbsp; There&#39;s the old Moose Lodge on 41st and Broadway there&#39;s a place that has dance classes advertised on 31st ave just east of Steinway - another dance place on broadway near 32nd street.&nbsp; Martial arts places are scattered all over - but I never really pay attention to where I see them.&nbsp; Some folks would be thrilled to have you pay to rent a room - other places probably have archaic rules about who is allowed to rent and who isn&#39;t.&nbsp; <br /><br />Good luck<br /><br />can grown ups come to the class?? I could use some hand clapping and marching at the end of the week!! (Shut it - Telly)<br /><br />

				Wow--I didn&#39;t log in for a few days and suddenly several of you have posted with great ideas.&nbsp; Thanks so much for the great suggestions.<br /><br />I actually managed to secure space at the Astoria Center of Israel on Crescent Street.&nbsp; Classes will be starting in February on Wednesday mornings, and I&#39;ll be offering free trial classes throughout January, and will post information about those very soon.<br /><br />In response to a few of the comments posted, Music for Aardvarks is also a national program, though not as well-known as Music Together....yet...we&#39;re working on it! :-D&nbsp; For more information on the program or to listen to the original music, please visit www.musicforaardvarks.com.&nbsp; In the near future I&#39;ll be putting up a Queens Music for Aardvarks site and will post the url when it&#39;s up and running!<br /><br />Also, all children attend accompanied by an adult caregiver, so if you&#39;re a grownup with a toddler, then yes...you get to rock out with us!<br /><br />Thanks again, and if any of have questions about classes, please feel free to contact me.<br /><br />Best,<br />Allison<br />
