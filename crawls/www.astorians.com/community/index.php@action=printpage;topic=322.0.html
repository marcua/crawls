				Once upon a time, I thought that work and career were the &quot;hard&quot; parts<br />of life to figure out, and that the personal side of things would fall<br />neatly and more or less automatically into place. Oops. This<br />assumptionhas left me with a great career, along with my<br />family(including my 2 younger siblings and my totally cool nephew),<br />and all the friends I've gathered along the way. Which is kind of a<br />lot to have already, if you think about it. But, being a selfish<br />glutton, now I want the rest of the perfect life. Living in NY, having<br />a great job, friends and family, AND being in love. I love to cook,<br />dance (swing and salsa, please), travel, go camping, to ball games and<br />to the theater. All things that are better WITH someone. It's no fun<br />to open a fancy bottle of red wine and not have someone to share it<br />with. (Well, it's kind of fun, actually, but it's better with someone<br />who appreciates it as much as you do.) Can't claim to know exactly<br />what I'm looking for, though it involves someone who understands that<br />almost everything is funny in some way, who's convinced I'm slightly<br />too good for her and who I suspect is slightly too good for me. I am<br />by nature and training a lazy couch potato who loves to spend a day<br />reading or watching bad TV. However, &nbsp;I can quote all sorts of<br />reallybad 80s movies. I have a large DVD, CD, book collection, and it<br />would be even bigger if I didn't keep drinking it. I like music. And<br />photography, and painting. Now I just need someone who makes me die<br />laughing and wants to cook with me. My ideal match laughs. A lot. At<br />herself as much as at anyone else. She's well read and intellectually<br />curious, but just as curious about the Behind the Music talking about<br />the one-armed drummer in Def Leppard. She enjoys trying new things.<br />She loves food and wine, and probably likes cooking. She enjoys the<br />outdoors, but probably isn't too obsessed with sports. (OK, this point<br />is flexible.) She loves movies, from Best in<br />Show to Rear Window to Kevin Smith movies to Casablanca to, of course,<br />The Princess Bride. He's not scared to hold a guy's hand in public.<br />She has, and understands, a deadpan sense of humor, and sees the<br />difference between making fun of people and being mean to them. She<br />hopes to find someone who's at least as smart as she is, and actively<br />wants someone who's successful and has hid own life. She gets that I<br />treat her very well and spoil her, and that I do so because I expect<br />her to do the same for me. She likes men who can take care of<br />themselves, and understands that just because he CAN take care of<br />himrself doesn't mean he doesn't like it when she does things for<br />him,too.Lastly, doing well at whatever she does is very important to<br />her,but work isn't the ONLY thing to her.<br /><br />OU CAN GET ME AT AOL MESSAGER: MANSEEKLOVEINNYC<br />email me at mydestiny@gmail.com<br />MORE PICTURE ON THIS SITE:<br />http://share.shutterfly.com/osi.jsp?i=EeJMWTdo5buEA
