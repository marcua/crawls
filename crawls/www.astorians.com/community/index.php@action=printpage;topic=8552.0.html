				That&#039;s a great idea.&nbsp; After Thanksgiving is probably better, but as there are tons of holiday parties for peeps coming up, a Monday or Tuesday would work best.&nbsp; What&#039;s the first Tuesday in December?&nbsp; Any new folks want to plan this one?

				Have you guys ever had a mixer at Rapture?&nbsp; It has a fun vibe and pretty decent food/drinks.&nbsp; It&#039;s on 28th Ave.&nbsp; Not too far for the Ditmars people and not too far for the Broadway people.<br /><br />Check it:<br />http://www.rapturelounge.com/home.html

				We&#039;ve done Rapture and it was really great.&nbsp; They have food too in case anyone gets hungry.&nbsp; Sounds good to me.&nbsp; By the way, Rover being divey wouldn&#039;t make it unworthy for a mixer.&nbsp; We don&#039;t always go for all the pretty establishments :)<br /><br />

				I love the Irish Rover, it&#039;s my favorite bar in Astoria :) Plus, it&#039;s one Block from Steinway so easy to take the Q101 to for those of you who don&#039;t want to walk :)<br /><br />The Rapture mixer was fun too, but if I recall correctly, it was kind of hard to &quot;mix&quot; during the busy time since everyone kind of parked themselves on couches.

				Sounds like a great idea.&nbsp; I&#039;m down for Dec. 4th.&nbsp; I was just saying that we should do a mixer on 28th Ave. so it&#039;s halfway in between those who live by Ditmars and those who live by Broadway.

				Ok I&#039;ll do it this time...<br /><br /><strong>Tuesday December 4th @ the Irish Rover, 7pm til the last one of us is left standing.</strong> (I think I left the last one around 10:30). If you are an early bird, just chirp up and I&#039;m sure there will be a few folks who would prefer to start earlier and you all can score a spot in the back. For those that haven&#039;t been, the Irish Rover is a fun laid back Irish bar on <strong>38th street and 28th avenue</strong>. They don&#039;t serve food, but they don&#039;t seem to mind when you bring it (I&#039;ve had Subway there at midnight). The back of the bar has tables and lots of space for us to congregate and mingle together. And the best part? This place rocks at buy backs. Like, every third or fourth is on them (usually the third though). <br />Ok, let&#039;s get the ball rolling. if you&#039;re in copy and paste the list into a new post and add your name at the bottom. If you&#039;re going to be early or late, note that next to your name. And if I erroneously included you, sorry and feel free to adjust or admonish me. I just went through the thread and included just about anyone amenable to the idea.<br />We&#039;ll see y&#039;all there!<br /><br />angastoria<br />Hrmph<br />Capibara<br />Daisy<br />gc_nyc <br />katlu<br />Edenpb<br />Alison<br />lizluv43<br />paratactical<br />PDQ Fruitbat<br />Heff<br />RedSoxFanNYC<br />MagicPie<br />NTrain<br />Firelight79 (probably on the later side since I don&#039;t live that close...circa 8pm)<br /><br />

Since I&#039;m one of the few idiots that has my face as my avatar, people sometimes see me and are all, &quot;hey...um....are you the astorian people?&quot; and I act like I have no idea what they are talking about and make them feel like a fool. (I kid! I kid! I&#039;m always all, &quot;hey! hi!&quot;)<br /><br />Also just to keep your eye out for other people: MagicPie is a scared donut and Daisy will be the scared kitten by the jukebox. I don&#039;t know why these people are so stinkin scared. Big Bryan is not Bon Jovi (sorry to blow your cover), and I&#039;ve never met Edenpb, but I&#039;ll be keeping my eye out for a milk carton.

				lizluv, I&#039;m so sorry to hear that :( that really stinks.<br /><br />So after paratactical&#039;s reception, you guys are really gonna hate me. Haha...<br /><br />I&#039;m really sick. (I&#039;ve had a cold for a couple weeks, but it&#039;s gotten worse.) I feel like my head is going to explode. My yearly soul crushing sinus infection has set in. I went to the doctor and I&#039;m on antibiotics, and I was hoping that I&#039;d feel well enough to go tonight. As the day has gone on, I&#039;ve felt progressively crappier. I&#039;ve been going back and forth on going, but the truth is, all I want to do is climb into bed. So that&#039;s what I&#039;m gonna do. Ugh.<br /><br />I&#039;m pissed I&#039;m not gonna make it, I was really looking forward to tonight, but it&#039;s just not gonna happen. Boo.<br /><br />If anyone wants to bring me hot chocolate after paratactical gets soup, it would make me very happy.

				Oh man I am so bummed I couldn&#039;t make it out last night! And even worse I didn&#039;t finish what I was working on last night!! I could&#039;ve just done it today and had a few pints. I totally love the Rover and don&#039;t go nearly enough. To top it off it&#039;s been slow at work so if I was a little hungover it wouldn&#039;t have mattered. grrrr!<br />glad to hear y&#039;all had fun though!

				Yes, last night was a lot of fun. I agree with everyone who said it was nice to put faces and names/avatars together. I still think we should do name tags with avatars on them for the next mixer! I wish I could have stayed longer but as some of you heard last night my job is quite crazy right now and I knew coming in hung over today wouldn&#039;t be the best idea. <br /><br />Daisy, don&#039;t forget to send the link to your pictures!

				I agree with daisy. The only reason I could think for a neg nod is the cross posting. But you know what? A comedy night seems fun and Matt is going out of his way to make sure astorians.com folk would not pay a cover AND get a free drink. Who would complain about that.<br /><br />I&#039;m totally down for a comedy night (says the girl who missed wingtacular because of a stomach bug...ugh!)
