				The current President sounds like a tyrant, maybe he doesn&#39;t believe in peace?&nbsp; It&#39;s pretty shocking that the woman who put up the peace wreath is a former Association President herself.

				Oh, man.&nbsp; Having just returned from visiting my parents and my childhood home, this brings up some lovely memories.<br /><br />Sometime in the early nineties, there was an attempt to form a homeowners&#39; association in our area.&nbsp; Now, I did not grow up in a subdivision, or in anything remotely resembling a suburb - this was a very rural area, we had neighbors with cows and horses and the like.&nbsp; Whether or not any given road around us was paved was kind of a 50/50 (and one of the roads leading to my parents&#39; street is still unpaved in 2006).&nbsp; <br /><br />We lived (and my parents still do) on a cul de sac up a hill, a little road off to the side with exactly five houses, none of them all that close to each other.&nbsp; The homeowners&#39; association was being instituted by a guy about half a mile away.&nbsp; It was rare that the neighbors on our little drive would see the neighbors up the hill, and vice versa - they rarely came up our way unless they were out for a walk, since there wasn&#39;t exactly anywhere to go.&nbsp; We&#39;d see them walking dogs from time to time, and maybe once in a blue moon somebody road their horse up our way, and we&#39;d walk over there for exercise or to feed the horses, but we really considered the cul de sac to be our neighbors, and everybody else, well, whatever.<br /><br />Under these circumstances, needless to say, my parents and the other four families on the cul de sac (who all got along pretty well) decided they didn&#39;t really have any need for any kind of association.&nbsp; This was also the year that they started the tradition of a progressive holiday dinner on the cul de sac.&nbsp; Somewhere there&#39;s a picture of all five families in one of the houses during the main course, posing beneath a Print Shop banner (oh, the early nineties) reading &quot;[CUL DE SAC] HOMEOWNERS&#39; DISASSOCIATION&quot;.<br /><br />Not content to have our never-seen cul de sac breaking from his ranks, the dude half a mile away went through the deeds and dug up some obscure code about acreage and lot size in the neighborhood which basically declared illegal our next-door neighbors&#39; lot, as well as the lot on which my family had been living for about fifteen years at that point.&nbsp; There was an exception in the files for our lot, which is why the lot had been divided the way it was about two decades before, but looking back as a New Yorker it makes me just shake my head.&nbsp; The dude was going to try to take legal action against my parents for our lot being too small, when we were surrounded by so many trees that you still can&#39;t see your neighbors during the spring/summer when the trees are full.&nbsp; (Winter is another story).&nbsp; Like, why?&nbsp; I understand the desire to keep the lots larger in a rural area to keep houses apart to keep the feel, but seriously, given the skinny shape of the hill, it made sense for our lots to be a little smaller.<br /><br />Eventually the homeowners&#39; association fell apart without ever really starting.&nbsp; All these years later, there are still exactly five houses on our cul de sac, and they still do the progressive dinner.&nbsp; One family who lived on the cul de sac left town for awhile, then returned to buy a house down the road, so now they have six families in the progressive dinner each year and just drive over for one of the courses.&nbsp; <br /><br />Other than that, things are pretty much the same.&nbsp; Everybody just respects everybody else as a general rule.&nbsp; Seriously, how hard is that?<br /><br />(There was a little issue for awhile with one family on the cul de sac with really annoying holiday decorations, but they moved out.&nbsp; I still think the neighbors would rather have dealt with them than with the homeowners&#39; association, although I did see my mother wistfully revisit the idea once or twice while being blasted with holiday music at one in the morning from the loudspeakers next door.)

				As I understand it co-ops and homeowners associations are basically communes so yeah, the &quot;community&quot; owns the outside walls, and you only own the inside walls of your house.<br /><br />As stupid as the leadership board of this association are, they are within their rights to do whatever they want to the outside of any house in their communal ownership.<br /><br />In a co-op or homeowners association you don&#39;t own your home - the community does. It&#39;s a very important thing to consider when you buy into one (you&#39;re not buying a house, you&#39;re buying into the commune.)<br /><br />And one reason why I personally too am not attracted to this kind of &quot;home ownership.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=4237.msg42170.html#msg42170">Quote from: daisy on November 27, 2006, 11:21:59 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">All the more reason not to buy into a coop.&nbsp; <br /><br />But apparently homeowner associations are in charge of other developments too?&nbsp; I&#39;m confused as to how much power they wield?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

Communes are income-sharing intentional communities (http://ic.org/), where any income you make from either internal or external work belongs to the group. Co-ops are a legal structure where the co-op owns the building, and you buy shares in the co-op in order to live in the building. This is distinct from a condo, where the condo association owns the walls of the building (and you pay maintenance to the condo association for the property), but you actually legally own everything &quot;from the paint in&quot;. And this is further distinct from a homeowners association (which I know the least about), where I think you own all of the property, but have entered into some sort of binding contract that restricts what you (and your neighbors) can do with the exterior of the property without permission from the association. (Please correct me if I&#39;m wrong about the homeowners associations...)<br /><br />I&#39;d also like to take this opportunity to plug intentional communities, including co-housing (http://www.cohousing.org/default.aspx) and &quot;hippie-commune&quot; style housing co-ops (http://www.nasco.coop/). I lived in, co-founded some of, and helped to run the co-ops in Champaign-Urbana, IL (http://www.couch.coop), and am very happy to have done so. Housing co-ops are like boarding houses that are owned and run democratically by the residents, while co-housing is like a condo or small housing development. Both are distinct from condos and New York-style co-ops by having an actual community feel that makes living in them more like living in a small village than just another building or just another development. For example, co-housing usually has a community center with child care, shared meals, etc. There are many thousands of people in the US and elsewhere who enjoy the community aspect of living in an IC.<br /><br />Thank you.

				I think co-housing is pretty neat.&nbsp; From my experience talking with those living in these communities, it&#39;s a lovely balance between community and privacy.&nbsp; Each familial unit (however many people) has its own flat or house (I&#39;ve only seen co-housing in CA, where there&#39;s more space) and there is also a community house centrally located where communal meals and such are held.&nbsp; The people I&#39;ve spoken to really enjoyed the balance, felt it was a safe place for their kids, and were active members of both their co-housing community and their greater community (cities of Oakland and Berkeley).&nbsp; Anyway, I have a lot of good feelings about co-housing.<br /><br />Does anyone know much about TIC (tenants in common)?&nbsp; I remember there was a lot of buy-up of buildings to go TIC in SF in the late 90s...

				Thanks for the very in-depth clarification. I was oversimplifying for the sake of conversation.<br /><br />The bottom line for me is that when it comes to &quot;communal&quot; ownership of any part of my dwelling I&#39;m inclined to be very careful what agreements I enter into whether that means my walls, entire house, or just the front lawn are communally controlled, or whether I hold &quot;shares&quot; that represent my stake in the dwelling. When it comes to my home &quot;democracy&quot; isn&#39;t always the best - as the person in this story discovered. If a bunch of crazy neighbors move in and democratically decide to make your life a living hell, your only option is to become crazy yourself or move.<br /><br />I&#39;m all for democracy - just not when it comes to certain aspects my personal life and what I&#39;d define as my personal space.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=4237.msg42199.html#msg42199">Quote from: Harlan on November 28, 2006, 10:53:59 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">No, neither co-ops nor homeowners associations are communes.<br />(http://forums.seroundtable.com/images/smilies/imported-smilies/hippie.gif)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				From today&#39;s NY Times:<br /><br />Pro-Peace Symbol Forces Win Battle in Colorado Town (http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/29/us/29wreath.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin).<br /><br />In part:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">In any case, there are now more peace symbols in Pagosa Springs, a town of 1,700 people 200 miles southwest of Denver, than probably ever in its history.<br /><br />On Tuesday morning, 20 people marched through the center carrying peace signs and then stomped a giant peace sign in the snow perhaps 300 feet across on a soccer field, where it could be easily seen. <br /><br />“There’s quite a few now in our subdivision in a show of support,” Mr. Trimarco said.<br /><br />A former president of the Loma Linda community, where Mr. Trimarco lives, said Tuesday that he had stepped in to help form an interim homeowners’ association. <br /><br />The former president, Farrell C. Trask, described himself in a telephone interview as a military veteran who would fight for anyone’s right to free speech, peace symbols included. <br /><br />Town Manager Mark Garcia said Pagosa Springs was building its own peace wreath, too. Mr. Garcia said it would be finished by late Tuesday and installed on a bell tower in the center of town.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
