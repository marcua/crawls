				If you&#039;re either looking to supplement your Great Adventures theme park rush or just looking to make a few extra hundred thousand...look no further. Your ride to work could be the deal breaker. Ever experience a ride into Manhattan on the N or Q as you approach Queen Borough Plaza (after leaving 39th Avenue)?!! For some reason, the motorman confuses the subway track with the Indy 500 track and manages to take that sharp turn on the left side of the wheels while the right side are air borne. No different than a kid chasing the Ice Cream truck around the corner on his bike with bent training wheels making a sharp turn.<br />If you are new to the ride, you could easily slide off your chair, hang from a pole like a curtain, or simply bust your caboose! Really, seriously, you should join me and contact the station manager for your Astoria stop and press this liability ($$$) concern.&nbsp; :shocked:

				That turn is the best part of the ride! Best when you&#039;re in the last car too.<br />No trains have fallen from the tracks so no need to get litigious. <br />Ride in the middle if you can&#039;t handle it.

				This has actually been concerning me lately too. It wasn&#039;t always like that, and it&#039;s worse for people who are at the rear of the train (which is where I ride when going to work). The train slows down while the front is going around the bend, and then it speeds into Queensboro Plaza, whipping the back of the train along with it. To me it seems like bad programming, assuming there&#039;s some sort of computer controlling the train&#039;s speed at different times. (Or bad driving, if not.)<br /><br />People laugh at your post, but every morning when we go around that turn the people standing up are jerked around, and the people sitting down dig their feet into the floor to keep from sliding off the bench. It&#039;s kind of wiggy for an elevated train, and I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if this is damaging the rails, especially with how loudly the thing squeals as this is happening.

				Yeah--I don&#039;t think riders should feel like they&#039;re going to fly across the car on that turn.

				I respectfully disagree and as a citizen of our city and taxpayer I will vociferously counter any petitions or write in campaigns to slow the train down.<br /><br />If 4 trains an hour take that turn, one can extrapolate that over a 50+ yr span that is over 1.75 million rides incident free. I feel quite safe the physics is right on regardless of the the queasiness or doubts of my fellow riders.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Ignatius Tremaine Splangford Esq.<br />(http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/William_Hallett_Ray.jpg)

				I take that train every morning.&nbsp; Never noticed anything drastic.&nbsp; Although today the train was riding slow and decided to speed up while turning on that bend.&nbsp; That was pretty stupid.&nbsp; I was also hung over and didn&#039;t feel like experiencing any more unnecessary movement.

				This post brought back a memory. Back in the 70&#039;s or 80&#039;s The Daily News had an astrologer name Jean Dixon. At the start of each year they would publish some of her predictions for the upcoming year. Some were like what celebrities would get married or divorced or have a kid. Some were about a&nbsp; natural disaster hitting a area.&nbsp; But the one I remember is her predicting that a train would fall off the tracks and fall to the street at that very turn.&nbsp; Well like 99% of her predictions it didn&#039;t happen.&nbsp; Yet.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				The wheels won&#039;t come off the tracks. Derailments usually occur for other reasons.<br /><br />There are safety mechanisms in place that prevent the trains from exceeding certain speeds. If you look at the tracks you will notice a steel lever powered by a hydraulic mechanism.&nbsp; Look at them the next time you miss the train, you will see the lever rise up. Then as a train approaches, or if you are looking at a train across the tracks, look at the front part of any car, just in front of the wheels. You will notice a steel trigger that is just at the level of the lever that rises up on the tracks. If the track lever is up, it will trigger the braking mechanism.<br /><br />Also, train suspension and chassis are engineered so that the train leans during turns, specifcally to prevent it from flipping over. If you have ever taken an Amtrak Acela train, you will notice that at high speeds the train leans. Another factor is that on turns, the tracks themselves are position to NOT be level and to allow for a gradient. <br />Think of a NASCAR race as the car approaches the turn on the oval, the road tilts. I can go into the physics of it all, but if you search centripetal and centrifugal acceleration with tracks + roads you should find good details.<br />
