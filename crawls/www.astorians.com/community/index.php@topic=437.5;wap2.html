			When Nick and I stopped by they said it was going to be called Waltz and they where going to be more of a music cafe. People could get stuff like pastries and listen to jazz, tango and classic stuff. No rock or anythig modern.

			Update -- it opened this weekend. &nbsp;Hours roughly 11am-10pm, no internet, dessert.<br /><br />They are going to have performance (music) and they've got a small selection of new and used books. &nbsp;Small. &nbsp;But I expect that will grow.<br /><br />The desserts looked good. &nbsp;The space is quite nice.
