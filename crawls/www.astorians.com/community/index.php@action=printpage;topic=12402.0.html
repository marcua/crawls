				She seemed so much more comfortable when McCain was sitting next to her in the follow-up interview, when he actually allowed her to talk - and when she said things he liked, he smiled like a proud parent. When she said things he didn&#039;t like, he got that weird, uncomfortable smile that he&#039;d get when Obama was saying things he didn&#039;t like in the debate.

				Most politicians at least try to answer the question, even if it&#039;s clear they&#039;re trying to lead the person away from what they really asked with the hopes that no one will notice. But Palin is an extreme case because she&#039;s so new at all of this, and the depth of her knowledge on national and international issues is limited to whatever one-liners and talking points she&#039;s been told to memorize by whomever&#039;s teaching her all this stuff. I don&#039;t blame her for not being comfortable talking about foreign policy and national issues, since both her life experience and governmental experience have been so limited to Alaska (and I&#039;m sure she&#039;s very familiar with many policies as they relate to Alaska), but that to me makes her unfit to be VP or, in the worst case, President. <br /><br />Katie Couric wasn&#039;t badgering her by any means. I mean it&#039;s pretty obvious that she&#039;s skeptical about Palin&#039;s qualifications and knowledge at this point, but she just wanted Palin to give her an answer that made sense.

Her answer to Katie (I wasn&#039;t really a part of &quot;that culture&quot;) was incredibly stupid because traveling to other countries doesn&#039;t really require a lot of &quot;that&quot; kind of money. I spent a year in Europe in college and believe me, I was not part of &quot;that culture.&quot; It was actually cheaper for me to live in Europe for a year than to go to college in California.<br /><br />It seems that any high-level executive should have at least <em>some </em>foreign policy experience or at least a larger world-view. I had a conservative friend tell me basically that foreign policy experience doesn&#039;t really matter since she would be dealing with U.S. matters anyway. Um. Okay. I couldn&#039;t even respond because I was so irritated with that comment.

				I guess that as someone who has spent time overseas I have the perspective that a least a wider worldview is only beneficial. Even though I lived in Europe for only about 9 to 10 months, it had a profound effect on how I perceive other cultures. I cringe when I think how she may possibly offend heads of state and other foreign officials because she has been so isolated. Clearly she appeared to charm a few of them last week (Pakistan was ready to hug her), but there&#039;s more to foreign policy than a pretty smile.<br /><br />I don&#039;t mean to belittle a person not being able to travel, but when you are aiming to be the vice president of &quot;the greatest&quot; or &quot;most powerful&quot; country on earth it would seem that you&#039;d want (read: need) to more intimately understand your allies and foes. And surely, if she is a heartbeat away from being our president she should have more knowledge than the cliff notes she&#039;s been given.<br /><br />This is just my $0.02.

				Here&#039;s the reason why people are so up-in-arms about Palin&#039;s lack of experience: Obama&#039;s lack of experience was one of McCain&#039;s main criticisms of him up until the point Palin was chosen. The other main criticism was that Obama is a better celebrity than politician. So then, after all that criticism of those two things, McCain now has a VP choice who is no more experienced and has become no less of a celebrity than Obama is. <br /><br />Now McCain attempts to explain it&#039;s different in her case by emphasizing all of Palin&#039;s &quot;executive&quot; experience, but give me a break. Executive experience as mayor of a very small town in Alaska, and then not even one full term as governor of the most sparsely populated state in the nation, which is also hundreds of miles away from the rest of the country. She never even got a passport until 2006, at 42 years old. This is not to demean her small-town roots or small-town people in general. But, by watching interviews she did before her being chosen for VP, it was clear she wasn&#039;t interested nor knowledgeable in how things were in the rest of the country or the world. She cared about how things were as they related to Alaska. Understandable as an Alaska governor, but not as a politician on a national level.<br /><br />To me, though, experience isn&#039;t the biggest of my concerns. Someone could have all the experience in the world, but I&#039;m not going to vote for them if I don&#039;t agree with their views. Obama supporters like Obama because they like his ideas, not the number of years he&#039;s been in the Senate. You can bet that so many liberals have reacted so harshly to Sarah Palin not only because McCain was hypocritical in his choosing someone no more experienced than Obama, but because she is viewed as being an ultra-religious ultra-conservative who wants pregnant rape victims to be forced to carry to term and doesn&#039;t care about polar bears.. among other things. Her being so inexperienced, and sounding so confused in interviews, is just the icing on the cake.

Education , the Chicago area schools are amongst the worst in the nation.what does that say about his work as a state senator or community activist,&nbsp; sex education in schools , we cant teach kids to read and write.do i want the same people who have failed to teach children the basics teaching them about sex. The financial crisis we are facing now ,all he can say about it is that this stems from the failed policies of the Bush administration. i watched an Obama spokesman last night and he could not say that McCain was right calling for better regulation of Fannie &amp;Freddie ,would not admit that the former heads of those 2 institutions are in anyway connected to his campain. What foreign policy experience does Obama have ? so far in his 3 1/2 years in the senate he has been campaining for president for the past 14 months, compairing the lack of experience of a vice presidential candidate to the presidential candidate , is freakin hilarious.

				odenhal, I&#039;m coming at this from a fairly objective perspective. While I do tend to lean liberal when it comes to social/environmental issues, I&#039;m not exactly a Democrat and I&#039;m not a big fan of Obama&#039;s. People have been comparing Palin to Obama because of the reasons I already mentioned - she is basically an Obama for conservatives when it comes to the things McCain had criticized Obama most about: celebrity/charisma and lack of experience. Prior to her being chosen, McCain&#039;s campaign wasn&#039;t exactly exciting, so people&#039;s attentions are naturally drawn to the person with more spark. Also, I would guess that a lot of independents were inclined to vote for him because of his experience. Palin throws that off a bit. By this point, she&#039;s probably drawn as many people to the McCain ticket as she&#039;s repulsed. As for an Obama spokesperson not being willing to admit that his opponent was right about something, McCain&#039;s spokespeople are exactly the same way. Nor can McCain admit he&#039;s wrong, even when it comes to lying in campaign ads. It&#039;s pretty pathetic.<br /><br />It&#039;s possible that if he&#039;d chosen a more moderate VP candidate, I could&#039;ve been convinced to vote for him, since as I already said I&#039;m not a giant Obama fan. But to me, the choice of Palin smacks of desperation to win the election, and I do not like the idea of someone with Palin&#039;s social/environmental views and parochialism being so close to the presidency. This is something that frightens a lot of people.... even Matt Damon.

				OK, see i fell that I too am coming from a fairly objective perspective, but i do lean in a Conservative direction on many issues .that being said i am not ready to pass judgement on Palin just yet .i think most of us seem to forget that she has not been running for the past year and a half like the other 3 candidates have been.do i think that the question af McCain&#039;s age put the question of the vice presidency more into focus , yes ,.do i feel that her experience is comparable to Obama&#039;s , yes<br /><br />As far as McCain&#039;s deceptive advertising , i am disappointed ,but his advertising is no more deceptive than Obama&#039;s. I remember a news clip of McCain on i think it was &quot;The View&quot; where they asked him, and he admitted it was wrong .now will those same host&#039;s ask Obama about the ad&#039;s running in the south with lies being told about McCain&#039;s stand on immigration ?&nbsp; no&nbsp; they wont . that&#039;s pretty pathetic<br /><br />Now as far as her social/enviormental&nbsp; views and parochialism those are the same concerns i have , but i will not demonize the woman, iwill not belittle the woman based on 1 interview . belittling her as a hick, being untraveled or insulting her outright just don&#039;t cut it with me.while i do like Matt Damon&#039;s work and would take advise in many things from him , presidential politics&#039;s is not one of them

It&#039;s every interview I&#039;ve seen with her - one before she was chosen as VP (interview happened last year, before this was even a thought) and then the few that have taken place since she was chosen. I wouldn&#039;t go so far as to call her a hick, and I think it&#039;s pretty clear that, due to her degree in journalism, she is a talented public speaker and is probably a talented debater when in her element. But McCain&#039;s campaign and the intense scrutiny she&#039;s coming under seem to be doing a number on her. She&#039;s so afraid of saying the wrong thing that she doesn&#039;t seem to know what to say anymore about just about anything. I have no idea what to expect from her tonight. I figure it&#039;ll either be really awkward to go along with her recent interviews, or she&#039;ll turn around and be her old self again. The ultimate anti-climax will be if the debate is as unremarkable as the first McCain/Obama debate.<br /><br />Now I&#039;m going to order a pizza and eat it by myself, as my own personal debate party.
