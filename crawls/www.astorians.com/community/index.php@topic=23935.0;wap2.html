			Is it only me or any of you noticed that as soon as you turn into Q plaza with the NQ trains the cell and data signal goes down?<br />shouldn&#039;t be the best served spot in Astoria?<br />Jussain&#039;...<br /><br /><br />Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk HD

			It&#039;s been like that since I&#039;ve had a cell phone ... so 15 years or so.

			I have a Verizon non-smartphone and don&#039;t generally have a problem getting a signal over there.

I think it was because historically Qb plaza was a waste land. Aside from the subway station and the state unemployment office that since closed, it was only frequented by prostitutes and drug dealers along with thier customers, not to mention&nbsp; people assoicated with the topless joints.<br /><br />As the plaza has been cleaned up over the years, the cell coverage has improved ever so slightly.
