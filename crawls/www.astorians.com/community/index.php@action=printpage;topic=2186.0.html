				Hey everyone,<br /><br />Just wanted to say thanks and let you all know that we @ Waltz will no longer post any events on the Board.<br /><br />Suffice to say , that we don&#39;t want to overstep any &quot; Rules &quot; in place for the Board<br />and would rather not be in the position of defending our &quot; promo&#39;s&quot; for events we <br />present here in Astoria.<br /><br />We feel that the acts or persons using the cafe&#39; for events would be better off doing <br />listings here.<br /><br />We feel that providing an outlet for musicians, artists, poets &amp; all fellow Astorians is <br />our contribution to The Area...<br /><br />To the &quot;Owners of this Board&quot; as well as those that frequent it.<br />We thank you and apologize to any of you that found our event postings <br />to be <br />&nbsp; &quot; Shame-less self promotions &quot;<br /><br />We will continue to list our events on our website and rant and rave&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;on our blog...<br /><br /><br /><br />Love<br />Bill @<br />Waltz

				It is now.<br /><br />Either place would have been okay just so you know. Let me know if you prefer this thread be in the &quot;General&quot; area. I&#39;ve merged the topics as to avoid duplicate posts referring to the same content.

				Bill &amp; Waltz,<br /><br />I hope you&#39;ll reconsider and continue to post here.&nbsp; While we do sometimes reorganize and have been attempting to clarify the forum posting guidelines, this shuffling about is NOT meant to reflect negatively on you (as merm said).&nbsp; <br /><br />The fantastic community spirit Waltz fosters in Astoria is a welcome thing -- and while clearly some of the promoting is business related, I see it as a business the community depends on.&nbsp; Sappy, yes.&nbsp; Do we need to know about operating hours and daily happy hour specials at the Beer Garden where most locals don&#39;t even bother with anymore for the stupidly long lines?&nbsp; Eh, probably not.&nbsp; But special events at a local cafe -- poetry readings, open mic nights, wine tastings -- all involving members of the great Astoria community, clearly <em>belong</em> here.<br /><br />All that and I&#39;m a big fan of cafes so.... rock on Waltz.<br /><br />cheers,<br />jayme<br /><br />edited my post for mis-typing.&nbsp; oops.

				I&#39;ll 7th or 8th the request that you continue to post here. :)<br /><br />And I&#39;ll reiterate that my comment about your shamless plug for your blog wasn&#39;t meant to reflect negatively on you personally, your fine cafe establishment, or your blog itself. It was just the method that you used to advertise&nbsp; your blog that I thought was over the top.<br /><br />I love it that Waltz posts here, especially when the posts aren&#39;t: duplicated in multiple categories, or miscategorized. The vast majority of the time there&#39;s no problem, as I said, just this time it seemed over the top.<br /><br />I too hope you&#39;ll reconsider.

				Hey Everyone,<br />Thanks for all the kind words and support.<br />But maybe I didn&#39;t make myself clear.<br /><br />Not only am I not offended by the replies, I admit that as the owner of Waltz I <br />clearly shamelessly promote&nbsp; us at every given opportunity. After all keeping a place like Waltz open and keeping the roof over our heads is not easy.<br /><br />I also, clearly understand the &quot;Rules&quot; and again apologize for any <br />double postings here that my have clogged up &quot;YOUR Board&quot;<br /><br />That being said, I continue to support Astoria , in every way, shape and form<br />and will encourage the artists that use our space to post events on the Board.<br /><br />I however, feel that the Board is best left for my fellow resident Astorians .<br /><br />Waltz is clearly here for the Community and for the Artists to have a space to perform , <br />experiment, work or just play . We will continue to support those freedoms of expression that clearly are part of the life of this community.<br /><br />On a final note ( no pun intended ) ... Clearly posting in two catagories on Your Board was not an attempt to SPAM , if it was taken as such ,again we apologize.<br />After re-reading the &quot;Rules and Regs&quot; for participation Both my Partner and l feel it best to remain un-registered.<br /><br />Thank You <br />All for the support &amp; Love<br /><br />Bill &amp; Song ...<br /><br />

				I&#39;m sorry to see you go Waltz.&nbsp; I&#39;m still not sure why you can&#39;t just post your events in the community activities area.&nbsp; I first learned about your events and your cafe from this site, and I think this site is a valuable resource for these kinds of things.&nbsp; So you posted in the wrong place, big deal.&nbsp; It&#39;s been corrected.&nbsp; I really like your cafe.&nbsp; I too hope you will reconsider, but I understand your decision, and everyone&#39;s elses opinions as well.&nbsp; I&#39;m sad to see you go.&nbsp; &nbsp; :-( :-( :-(

				As a relatively new Astorian I have to say that I have found this board invaluable for obtaining information about local events/issues/topics for discussion.&nbsp; That a business would choose not to post on the board for such petty reasons as that they were asked to restrict their posts to the appropriate category is petty and absurd.&nbsp; What we have is the equivalent of a child who doesn&#39;t like the way other kids are playing and whines, &quot;I&#39;m taking my toys and going home.&quot;&nbsp; No one wins with this course of action.&nbsp; Waltz is a good place and the board should be a good place to find out information about upcoming events.&nbsp; Perhaps a bit of maturity is in order and Waltz can choose to put bruised ego aside and continue to utilize a valuable resource.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				As one of the people that realize that any part of Astoria is as important as the next, Walt-Astoria is one of those places that is as valuable as even the bagle store across from Grow Tech Services (forgive me if I have spelled it wrong for the umpteenth time in my life..). Likewise, I urge a business like them to officially continue their scheduling in a post like this without any conflict regardless as to who says who, and as to which person didn&#39;t act on which certain day, etc.<br /><br />&nbsp;I also second on what chet said, because not only is that one person who officially tells people to restrict any post, be it moderator or head honcho of a legit site such as this, limiting everyone else who would like to spread and share ideas in a way so people can join into, but that person is literally reflecting themselves on the site itself and everyone else that has posted on it TILL NOW. To put it more clearly, if one person were to tell me to stop saying what I have to say and let everyone else chatter about, that could spark up a bigger hostility than expected.<br /><br />All I am asking is for Waltz-Astoria, regardless of my relation with both Bill and Song and as my limited presence in their cafe/lounge due to my strict schedule, to please continue posting up their ideas as much as possible, let bygones be bygones, and have everyone else here happy as everyone else in Astoria.<br />
