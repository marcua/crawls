				I love Astoria, and am sad to say that I&#039;ll be leaving.&nbsp; I need a place with more space and found it impossible to find a 1BR in my price range in Astoria that wasn&#039;t snapped up before I could get to it.&nbsp; My new lease (in Woodside) begins on September 1st and I will probably be fully moved in by next week.<br /><br />I found my new place so fast that I haven&#039;t told my landlord yet.&nbsp; He&#039;s been a decent landlord and I don&#039;t feel like it&#039;s right to just run out and not give him notice, so I thought I&#039;d find him a replacement tenant.&nbsp; I&#039;ll say this apartment is available September 15th, but if you need to be in earlier, we can arrange that.&nbsp; We can prorate the September rent (for example, if you move in Sept. 10th, you would pay $666.67 and I would pay $333.33.&nbsp; <br /><br />STUDIO APARTMENT<br />-basement apartment<br />-heat, hot water and electricity are included.&nbsp; The only thing you&#039;d have to pay besides the rent is cable/internet if you want it.&nbsp; Hookups are there already.<br />-located 4 blocks from the 36th Avenue N/W subway, or 10-12 blocks from the R/V train (36th Street stop or Steinway Street stop).<br />-4 blocks to grocery store, convenience store less than 1 block, Walgreens 2 blocks away<br />-laundomat 1 block away<br />-gym 1 block away, also another gym 3 blocks away<br />-I don&#039;t know the exact measurements, but the apartment is large enough to hold my queen size bed, dresser set (3 large dressers), loveseat couch, ottoman and microwave stand.&nbsp; <br />-Big closet<br />-full bathtub/shower<br />-separate entrance.&nbsp; Landlord and his family live upstairs but apartment is not directly connected.<br />-Please note that the kitchen area is not separate.&nbsp; On one wall of the apartment is the refrigerator, stove and sink.<br />-No pets allowed.<br /><br />If interested, please send me a PM with your phone number and I&#039;ll call you back.&nbsp; This is a good place for someone who wants to live in Astoria, doesn&#039;t want roommates but can&#039;t afford to get a 1BR.

				The landlord put a new floor in and painted before I moved in last August.&nbsp; I think the sink in the kitchen area and the cabinet above it was new as well.&nbsp; Older stove and refrigerator, but both in good working order.&nbsp; Bathroom items are not new, but in good working order.
