				Hey Astorians-<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I have a 12-week-old male Maltese puppy that I am thinking about selling. He is about 2 pounds or so. My boyfriend got him for me as an anniversary gift 4 days ago, and he didnt take into consideration that I work 10 hours a day. This is the time in a puppy&#39;s life when he&#39;s supposed to have attention and have someone training him, and me not being home most of the day kind of defeats the purpose. I can&#39;t afford doggie day care or a dog walker to come 3 times a day, so I want to see if anyone would be interested in being his new family. He is from a breeder and it cost my boyfriend $1500 to buy him. He would come with (for FREE): <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />ALL NEW:<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />1) His crate ($45)<br /><br /><br />2) About 50 wee-wee pads ($30)<br /><br /><br />3) A coat, matching boots, 4 sweaters, a sweatsuit, and a tee shirt ($100)<br /><br /><br />4) A doggy-bed ($35)<br /><br /><br />5) Nature&#39;s Miracle Odor and Stain remover (about 3/4 full)($5)<br /><br /><br />6) Special Puppy white coat shampoo and a special dog towel ($10)<br /><br /><br />7) Tear stain remover ($6)<br /><br /><br />8) Nature&#39;s miracle pet wipes ($5)<br /><br /><br />9) Special room deodorizer ($5)<br /><br /><br />10)Dog treats, toys, chew bones, etc ($10)<br /><br /><br />11) Harness, leash, 2 customized rhinestone collars with his name on them ($40)<br /><br /><br />12) A dog carrier purse ($40)<br /><br /><br />13) A special airline dog kennel ($50)<br /><br /><br />14) An automatic water feeder, and an automatic food feeder ($25)<br /><br /><br />15) Many other puppy odds and ends.<br /><br /><br />16) His vaccination papers &amp; registration papers. He also comes with a 1-year health guarantee from either one of 3 animal clinics in the area. One is in queens, the other in nassau county, and i cant remember where the other one is. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Max is a good puppy always playing and kissing me, but I just dont have the time for a 3 month old puppy, and I know he deserves someone who can give him more attention.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />If you are looking for a sweet, friendly, adorable puppy that you can keep in a small apartment or house, Max is the one for you. Please help me find him a better home than what I can give him. You can e-mail me with any questions or to set up a time to come and meet him. <br /><br />You can also check him out on dogster at: www.dogster.com/?418519.<br /><br />[img width= height=]http://img293.imageshack.us/img293/4519/img00073rx3.jpg[/img]<br />[img width= height=]http://img293.imageshack.us/img293/9428/img00074wv3.jpg[/img]<br />[img width= height=]http://img136.imageshack.us/img136/7927/img00075dv8.jpg[/img]<br />[img width= height=]http://img205.imageshack.us/img205/6913/img00077gd5.jpg[/img]<br /><br />[attachment deleted by admin]
