				Hi all!&nbsp; Like many of you, I&#039;ve been peeking in on construction and asking around about this curiously cool looking place.&nbsp; Yesterday I emailed the Agave restaurant in the West Village (www.agaveny.com) to confirm the rumor that they are coming in to that space (thank you Joey in Astoria http://astorianyc.blogspot.com/).&nbsp; They wrote back today and said that it&#039;s true and they&#039;re opening tonight!&nbsp; I&#039;ve been to Agave and if it&#039;s any indication of how great this place will be (Mojave?) we are in for a real treat!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Cool, thanks for letting everyone know! If the Agave menu in the city (http://www.agaveny.com/menus.html) is anything to go on, this could be a great to get reasonably-priced, well made SW food. FINALLY.<br /><br />We might try it this weekend.

				that was a quick example based on their Manhattan Menu. And for some people, $4 just might BE a deal breaker.<br />For that location, an &quot;upscale&quot; SW/Mexican type of eatery seems a bit out of place.

				My official review:<br /><br />Because we eat early like old folks, I think we may have been the first people to have dinner here. We had the butternut squash bisque, southwest caesar salad, garlicky potato frites, and shrimp tacos. The bisque, frites, and tacos were really yummy, and the salad was good. We had the molten chocolate cake for dessert, and it was a typically tasty molten chocolate cake. The service was a little slow, but they generally seemed to know what they were doing. <br /><br />I am very happy with this addition to the neighborhood, and from the number of people who were there by the time we left, it looks like many others have been waiting for a place like this to open up around here. Yes, it&#039;s a little pricey, but I&#039;m willing to pay for a great meal that I don&#039;t have to go to Manhattan for. <br />

				We just got back from dinner there. &nbsp;The menu and prices are very similar to Agave (we are big fans of that place) but the food was still phenemonal.&nbsp; &nbsp;Everything we had was really good. &nbsp;The design is beautiful and the bar was packed. &nbsp;Probably 65% of the tables were taken as well by the time we left.<br /><br />Our only complaint was the service. &nbsp;Our waitress didn&#039;t know the menu at all and left us for dead once the food hit the table. &nbsp;Everyone was kind of running around lost which is to be expected for opening night so is forgiveable. &nbsp;One of the owners stopped by and it sounds like they have a lot of plans for the back area including a garden. &nbsp;<br /><br />Overall this place is a welcomed addition to the neighbourhood once they get the kinks worked out. &nbsp;For opening night though I was pleased - especially with the guacamole.&nbsp; &nbsp;:mrgreen:<br /><br />P.S. They already have their liquor license so I strongly suggest the blood orange vodka mojito!

				I just walked past the restaurant on my way home and the place was packed.&nbsp; And everyone getting off the subway was stopping in front of it to check it out.&nbsp; So hopefully that&#039;s a good sign for lasting success.&nbsp; Can&#039;t wait to check it out.

				Just got back from there as well.&nbsp; My other half had to leave early, but we had started chatting to the people at the table next to us and they asked me to join them -- so I had a right good time.&nbsp; &nbsp;:mrgreen:<br /><br />We only sampled a few of the apps (guacamole and chips, fried oysters, and calamari), but they were all delicious.&nbsp; The oysters were a real stand-out.&nbsp; I usually prefer my oysters raw, but these were done perfectly so that they were still, oh, oyster-y inside, with a light, crispy crust.&nbsp; The blue tortilla chips with the guacamole were really first-rate.&nbsp; The dips with the calamari were tasty and bit unusual (one was chipotle with a really nice smoky flavour and I think the other was lime), but the calamari themselves, while good, weren&#039;t anything unusual.<br /><br />Our new friends got the soft salmon tacos and the short ribs.&nbsp; Both were pronounced excellent, and the short ribs looked absolutely amazing - and smelled heavenly.&nbsp; Definitely on my to-try list.<br /><br />Our waiter was attentive and knowledgeable (and cute!), although he admitted that he was there only for the night - he&#039;s usually at Agave.&nbsp; I got the impression from the moment I walked in that that was true for the majority of the staff.<br /><br />A lot of the mixed drinks sounded great - and I&#039;m not much of a mixed drink person, but I do have to recommend the delicious (and deadly, if pricey), special margarita made with agave nectar.&nbsp; They&#039;ve got a great tequila menu as well, including tequila flights.<br /><br />I thought the liquor prices were on the high side for Astoria, and the app prices as well, but the entrees were generally between $20 and $25 -- not cheap, but not sky-high, either.&nbsp; There were two shepherd&#039;s pies on the menu -- one was $14, and the other was $15.<br /><br />Just saw krocker&#039;s post as I was about to post -- yes, by the time we were leaving around 9:45, it was PACKED.&nbsp; Almost not a seat to be had, and I think they have 55 tables (tables, not seats) - we saw a list at a waiters&#039; station.&nbsp; They have at least 72 seats at two-tops along the sides that can be combined in numerous ways to seat larger parties, plus a number of larger tables in the middle, not including the bar area at the back.

				Checked out Mojave last night and I&#039;m happy to report that it met my expectations!&nbsp; We stuck with simpler things, and hoped the lower priced options could still be good.&nbsp; I was wowed by the buffalo style chicken wings app - so fresh and crispy, great sauce.&nbsp; Shared the steak soft tacos and crab quesidillas and they were both impressive for a &quot;standard&quot; choice.&nbsp; &nbsp;Our entrees were $13 and $15, I believe, and definitely filling.&nbsp; When we go back we&#039;ll explore the menu further.&nbsp; &nbsp;The fajitas were priced at $22 (!) but I suspect it&#039;s a larger portion and worth it.&nbsp; Definitely lots of great options and the 3 things we did have were great.<br /><br />About the price, it is the same as Agave and at first I would have expected them to come down for Astoria.&nbsp; But when you think about it, why lower the bar?&nbsp; That makes is easier for disasters like Oceano to think they have a chance.&nbsp; It&#039;s time for an upgrade around here.&nbsp; I&#039;m not saying upgrade means expensive - but Mojave has tasteful decor, a unique menu, great atmosphere and (so far) delicious - just like some of our other favs around here.&nbsp; And there is a range on the menu.&nbsp; For an app and two entrees, the bill was $39.&nbsp; That was without drinks - lots of options there too!&nbsp; <br /><br />The bar was packed and had a nice atmosphere.&nbsp; I think it would have been wise to make the bar area larger and have less tables.&nbsp; I think The space really is enormous.&nbsp; <br /><br />Looking forward to going back!

				We were there from 7:30-8:30 and the place was 75% full.&nbsp; We sat in the middle portion, along the wall and had no issue at all.&nbsp; From where we were, you could hear that there was more chatter towards the front of the room but I don&#039;t know if it would have been loud sitting in that section.&nbsp;

				I was there at about the same time, staying a little longer.&nbsp; I&#039;d say it was on the quiet side of loud.&nbsp; It&#039;s a big space and holds a lot of people.&nbsp; There were also a number of large groups streaming in about the time I was getting ready to leave who seemed to be there specifically for the opening, and so they created a larger volume of talking than there might be on a regular night.&nbsp; There was also music, and when I first sat down and noticed I was directly under a speaker, I thought it might be bothersome.&nbsp; It turned out to be fine - it wasn&#039;t too loud.&nbsp; They played a number of Morcheeba songs, which was nice.

				Thanks for the info on the volume level, stberg and lanseaux - it definitely sounds manageable.&nbsp; As I get older, I find I&#039;m more sensitive to the noise level in restaurants and bars, though I&#039;ve always found it&#039;s exhausting to try to talk over too much sound.&nbsp; Really looking forward to checking this place out soon!

				We actually ate at Mojave on their opening night. Food and ambiance were great. The prices are reasonable for that type of restaurant. Now here are a few areas that hopefully will improve. The frozen margaritas tasted more like a lime flavored slush from &quot;7 Eleven&quot;. I guess I am used to the great margaritas at Tequila Sunrise. The seating against the wall is way too high for the table and you have to lean over to eat. It also makes the person facing you feel very short and uncomfortable.<br />Overall the restaurant is a thumbs up and what we needed in the Ditmars area. <br />

				Hey all.&nbsp; I, too, was there last night.&nbsp; My take on the place:<br /><br />Upsides:<br /><br />*Food was delicious, different, and had &quot;just right&quot; portions<br />*My Margarita served &quot;up&quot; was fantastic and strong, and not full of filler to weaken it like a lot of places pour &quot;up&quot; drinks.&nbsp; It made it worth the extra dollar.<br />*Gorgeous atmosphere and furniture<br />*Bathrooms are actually on the same floor as the restaurant (this is a big issue not so much for me but for some of my mobility-impaired friends and family)<br /><br />Downsides:<br /><br />*Strictly amateur night on the service--took me forever to get a waitress, and then, to get a glass of water.&nbsp; Also, my waitress spoke bad enough English and didn&#039;t know the menu well enough to tell the difference between buffalo oysters and buffalo wings.&nbsp; &nbsp;I had to point to the menu and say &quot;NO, BUFFALO OYSTERS!!&quot; a few times.<br />*A contributing factor to the above may have been the volume level.&nbsp; Music was too loud.<br />*I usually dine solo in Astoria--if I dine out with friends, we usually meet up after our jobs in Manhattan.&nbsp; As such, I had every single service person in the place ask me if I was dining alone, and I got the feeling that at first, the&nbsp; matire&#039;d was trying to shunt me off to the crowded bar area.&nbsp; Granted, I would have LOVED to have eaten at the bar--it&#039;s always more social for solo diners-- but that area&#039;s current configuration would have made it impossible.<br />*Prices a bit high for the &#039;hood.<br /><br />Would I go back?&nbsp; YES.&nbsp; I had the buffalo oysters, the guac, and two margaritas for a light dinner and it was the best thing I&#039;d done for myself all week.&nbsp; The guacamole was a super-special standout and was just perfect, and the oysters were like nothing I&#039;ve ever had.<br /><br />My suggestions if the management is reading this:<br /><br />--Get your staff to learn the menu<br />--Get water on the table PRONTO and don&#039;t make me wave around like a drowning person to get more--you serve spicy food; stay on top of it.<br />--My money is just as green as the next person&#039;s; if you don&#039;t want to give 2-tops to solo diners (which I DO NOT recommend unless you want me to never come back) then at least expand the seating at the bar area so that the people sitting at the railing behind the bar aren&#039;t butt-cheek to butt-cheek with the people sitting on the stools behind them.&nbsp; If you DO decide to seat solo diners, don&#039;t try to shunt us off near the door or have every last person ask me if I am expecting someone else. Note that I have NEVER had this kind of treatment eating alone anywhere else in the area.&nbsp; Then again, Fatty&#039;s, Crescent on Vine, and most of the other places have large and well-situated bar areas that are usually packed with solo diners.&nbsp; Take the cue.<br /><br />

				One other thing--for folks who were there last night, the nice young guy with the trimmed &quot;pencil beard/moustache&quot; combo was the owner.&nbsp; I stopped to talk with him; he admitted that &quot;he&#039;s only there for tonight&quot; and is &quot;usually at my other place in Manhattan.&quot;&nbsp; Again, I do hope he reads these boards and takes our feedback.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;:mrgreen:

				My review:<br /><br />Left the apt at 6:15 and got to Mojave about five minutes later. Hostess sat us immediately without a reservation.<br /><br />Water was brought to the table immediately.<br /><br />A waitress, or who we thought was our waitress, took our drink orders. I ordered a frozen margarita and my boyfriend ordered a prickly pear mojito. <br /><br />Drinks came, the waitress seemed very unsure of herself while placing the drink in front of me- it was dripping full and slightly pink. Turns out they had made me a prickly pear margarita and a plain margarita for my boyfriend. No problem. I stuck with my margarita and she left to remake BF&#039;s drink. My margarita was great- really refreshing and fun. Although adding the prickly pear made my margarita $10 instead of 9. BF finally got his mojito and it was honestly...disgusting. Super sweet and not minty. Fatty&#039;s mojitos are lightyears better.<br /><br />Along with our drink orders, we had also placed our meal orders. This included the guacamole appetizer ($11), my entree Fried Buffalo Oysters and BF&#039;s entree was Blue Corn Chicken Enchiladas (18). I stressed Oysters when I ordered (&quot;I would like the fried buffalo oysters...Oysters.&quot;) because of earlier posts. She grinned and wrote this information down.<br /><br />While we sat, the couple to the left of us were getting worked up. BF and myself go out to restaurants frequently, BF is a chef and there is a restaurant in my family so we were prepared to wait. Not this couple. Their meal came after waiting for an hour and their appetizer arrived with their entree, and the couple sent the appetizer back. They wanted to speak to a manager because they seemed convinced that they gave their orders to a waiter who they watched leave the restaurant and never come back. Also while we were waiting for our appetizer, the four top next to us who had been seated with menus got up and left after waiting for about 25 minutes.<br /><br />After about a 70 minute wait our entree and appetizers arrived together. BF&#039;s enchiladas were cold and I had received Buffalo wings. Sent them back and asked for OYSTERS. The guacamole appetizer was great. No filler, wonderful cilantro and delicious fresh tomatoes. This also included a green salsa sauce that was so warm and delicious. Oysters came out. They were rushed but they tasted phenomenal with the blue cheese dressing. I only wish they had been a bit more crispy. Other than being cold, BF said his entree was fine. We were comped the appetizer and the bill came to $50. It doesnt look like our waitress actually gave our ticket to the line, and I don&#039;t even think she was a waitress- I believe she probably works in the bar because she didn&#039;t really wait on anyone but us and she was bringing drinks back and forth to tables..dropping them multiple times-and we had at least 5 different servers handle us after the appetizer issue. <br /><br />Music wasn&#039;t too loud. The place was PACKED. Great menu selection, food was very fresh, drinks were GREAT and fun.<br /><br />PROS: Diverse menu selection with emphasis on seasoning- this means the menu is packed with flavor. There are vegetarian options.<br /><br />Drink selection- they use a high quality margarita mix and fresh fruit. <br /><br />Quality of ingredients: Nothing was bagged or prepackaged, and if it was...bravo. It tasted great.<br /><br />Kind and attentive waitstaff.<br /><br />CONS: The restaurant has hired waitstaff who have obviously never worked in a restaurant before.<br /><br />The kitchen is possibly understaffed.<br /><br />There is a lack of communication between the front and back of the house, given that waiters oftentimes were seen without plates. It was a rarity that I saw a waiter with a plate of food.<br /><br />The hostess, although sweet, is a bit flighty and not really willing to actually acknowledge customers who are upset at that wait time. She would apologize but beyond that you could tell that that was all she was going to do.<br /><br />The seating for the booths along the restaurant&#039;s walls are about 3 inches too high so I towered over BF throughout the meal and made me slouch forward.<br /><br />Although BF disagrees, I think that the menu is overpriced by about $2 on appetizers and $3 on entrees. <br /><br />Wondering- are there dessert options? If so, we weren&#039;t made aware of them.<br /><br />SO. From a scale of 1 to 5 I gave Mojave a Golden Three. The golden means they did GREAT considering they have been open for two days and I have made room for growth. We will probably go back in a month, since the novelty of waiting 70 minutes for our appetizer will probably wear off before then. But we were prepared. The quality of the food is really awesome, the menu seemed inspired and the decor was fine-not too tacky or theme like. I really appreciate the way the designer has hid the waiter stations.<br /><br />It&#039;s a huge restaurant and I have a feeling that the kitchen probably needs 1-2 more people on the line.<br /><br />All in all...great..GREAT addition to the neighborhood. I was honestly impressed, and quite optimistic.

				Sounds good, looking forward to trying it. As for the prices, if the crowds keep coming it&#039;s not overpriced. Overpriced for *you* maybe (and likely me!), but not for its surroundings. Time will tell.

				We went on Saturday evening around 6:15.&nbsp; Soon after they opened.&nbsp; So I appreciate that it was soon after they opened (which is &quot;officially&quot; <strong>between</strong> 5 and 6).&nbsp; And I also appreciate that it was only their second day.&nbsp; But I agree with what others have said.&nbsp; The service is not just a little off - it&#039;s a glaring problem that needs to be rectified immediately.&nbsp; Our waiter told us he had never set foot in the place.&nbsp; That the owner took him from the Manhattan location and put him in Mohave for the night.&nbsp; He had no training or experience in that restaurant.&nbsp; He indicated that it was the same story for most of the wait staff on the floor.&nbsp; He also said the computer system is not yet installed.&nbsp; So they can&#039;t communicate orders to the kitchen efficiently.&nbsp; They also can&#039;t calculate checks by computer (check your check - there were a few mistakes on Sat night - though ours was added correctly).&nbsp; Enough with that.&nbsp; Our waiter was not to blame.&nbsp; This is an owner/management mistake.&nbsp; Our waiter tried his best for us and we tipped accordingly.<br /><br />I&#039;ll start by saying that we are not the kind of people that nitpick over prices.&nbsp; But that&#039;s not to say we don&#039;t recognize value.&nbsp; I do feel the drinks are priced high for our area.&nbsp; If you pop in after work and have a few mojitos, you can expect a nice tab -- not exactly a casual happy hour spot.&nbsp; And it doesn&#039;t take more than a few drinks to quickly escalate your total dinner check.&nbsp; $35 for a pitcher of sangria is high in my mind.&nbsp; We ordered the guacamole side dish.&nbsp; What came was a large thimble shaped bowl of guacamole.&nbsp; Not a garnish or nacho in sight.&nbsp; $4 for that seemed a bit much.&nbsp; Yes it was delicious.&nbsp; But for 3 tablespoons of guacamole?&nbsp; I should also add there is nothing to nosh on placed on the tables.&nbsp; At this price point, a little basket of nachos and salsa would be nice.&nbsp; They must think it would downgrade the experience.&nbsp; But I think they better come up with something for people to pick on while they look at the menu and wait an eternity for service.&nbsp; We also had the buffalo oysters.&nbsp; A good choice.&nbsp; But very heavy on the buffalo sauce.&nbsp; Too much to coat an oyster.&nbsp; Maybe fine for a chicken wing but oysters?&nbsp; (They need to sample the fried oysters at Mardi Gras on Austin Street in Forest Hills.&nbsp; They hit a homerun.)&nbsp; And they were not served hot (the computer/kitchen problems?).&nbsp; But I&#039;d try them again.&nbsp; I think they&#039;ll refine it in time.&nbsp; <br /><br />My wife had the short ribs.&nbsp; Portion was very generous and it was absolutely delicious.&nbsp; No complaints whatsoever.&nbsp; An excellent choice.&nbsp; I had the Pepita coated Atlantic Salmon.&nbsp; The fish was outstanding.&nbsp; Served over a bed of spinach and stewed tomatoes.&nbsp; It was really delicious.&nbsp; I recommend it.&nbsp; We also ordered a side of onion rings.&nbsp; Not good.&nbsp; A soggy, greasy mess of onion and batter (not together).&nbsp; The kitchen seems unfamiliar with the temperature of the grill and fryer.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure the onion rings will improve.&nbsp; The couple next to us ordered a hamburger medium.&nbsp; It was extra rare.&nbsp; Really raw.<br /><br />In the end, I think this is a great addition to the neighborhood.&nbsp; We will no doubt go again - probably often in fact.&nbsp; But, as a customer, you can&#039;t help but feel slighted that the owner would throw an untrained staff at our location.&nbsp; As if we didn&#039;t deserve better.&nbsp; Hopefully they will quickly realize that Astorians are discerning customers.&nbsp; That we have a neighborhood filled with outstanding eateries.&nbsp; Either they work out the bugs fast or they&#039;ll have an empty restaurant.&nbsp; We will go back in a few weeks.&nbsp; I&#039;d bet money that it will be a very different experience.

				we ate there last night! (sunday).&nbsp; me and my boyf are longtime fans of agave in the west village and went on a walk this afternoon while passing this place.&nbsp; not realizing that it was essentially the same thing, we decided to try it out for dinner.&nbsp; it&#039;s exactly the same!&nbsp; the food was phenomenal!&nbsp; the service, however, sucked.&nbsp; took a while for the waiter to take our order, they brought us our entrees before we were even halfway done with our appetizer, and we had to ask the staff to clear our tables after having our finished dishes in front of us for over 15 minutes!&nbsp; we even had to ask for a dessert menu!&nbsp; terrible service so far, but we&#039;ll go back since the food was so good.&nbsp; <br /><br />the short ribs were amazing, as was the chicken fried steak.&nbsp; i would however not order the CFS again because it wasn&#039;t so &quot;southwest.&quot;&nbsp; it was awesomely cooked and was delish, but would rather have something more southwestern influenced.&nbsp; if i was craving a CFS, then i would go.&nbsp; <br /><br />also, the guacamole appetizer... ask for no sour cream (unless you&#039;re crazy in love with sour cream).&nbsp; it just takes up a lot of the space in the chipbowl.&nbsp; i would have rather had more guacamole than sour cream.<br /><br />the prices were definitely manhattan.&nbsp; damn them...

				I wonder if they rushed to open without properly trained staff because of rent costs. It seems strange to have a place open with the service so up in the air, particularly from someone who owns a successful place in Manhattan. And for such a large restaurant, they need well-trained servers and an efficient kitchen. I hope they can iron out what everyone&#039;s complaining about. I&#039;m looking forward to trying it.

				I had dinner there last night and I would say that my review is definitely mixed.&nbsp; I&#039;m in complete agreement that the service was just a little off but I also think the food and drinks were a little off-the-mark as well.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Margaritas: I had one on the rocks and my boyfriend had one frozen.&nbsp; My glass was so jam packed with ice that I had maybe a sip and a half of pure &quot;drink&quot; before I was drinking a melted ice mix.&nbsp; The frozen one was better.&nbsp; If you like margaritas, stick to ordering them frozen, or better yet, straight up.<br /><br />Appetizer: We ordered the guacamole with blue tortilla chips.&nbsp; The guac came in a small bowl that was over-stuffed with sour cream, chopped tomatoes and lettuce.&nbsp; There was just over a tablespoon of guac in the serving if that.<br /><br />Main dishes:&nbsp; My boyfriend had the chicken-fried steak, and I had the jumbo gulf shrimp.&nbsp; His was very good and mine was just edible.&nbsp; My shrimp was bland, and the rice was mushy (i.e., as in over-cooked, not creamy).<br /><br />As everyone has stated, the restaurant itself is very pretty, but it reminded me of my first impression of Island Cafe, a nice-looking restaurant with only passable food.&nbsp; If I had to choose between a great-looking restaurant with mediocre food and a drab-looking place with great food, I&#039;d go for the latter.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m happy to have this addition on the north end of Astoria and would be willing to try the place again, but only after a couple of months.&nbsp; I would give them some time to get their act together on both the service and food fronts.<br /><br />

				Hmm.&nbsp; These reviews are actually making me glad I didn&#039;t try the restaurant this weekend.&nbsp; I was out of town and didn&#039;t have the chance, but now I think I may wait until they get their own staff, that staff gets used to the menu and their kitchen, and they work out these kinks.&nbsp; It sounds as if they just rushed this opening, without hiring and training their own staff, and having a kitchen and bartender who was ready and trained for business.&nbsp; I was really surprised when I had heard they were opening, because I didn&#039;t think they could possibly be ready yet, they had literally just put up the hopefully temporary sign for the place, and signs for hiring that week, and the place hadn&#039;t look completely done.&nbsp; I was thinking to myself, gee, they must have hired people mad quick!!!&nbsp; Now, come to find out, the waiters are from the Manhattan restaurant?&nbsp; As for&nbsp; being a Mexican restaurant and not having 1 chips and salsa on the table FREE, it&#039;s a big minus in my book, one big reason I like mexican is the free salsa and chips.&nbsp; As for Manhattan prices, I&#039;m actually not surprised.&nbsp; Ditmars has always had it&#039;s share of pricier establishments, where over $20 is the norm.&nbsp; For me, that&#039;s pricey, but I&#039;ll treat myself once in awhile if the food is worth it.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also noticed newer places are charging these kinds of prices, such as with Bar36 on 30th Ave, the martinis are $12.&nbsp; It&#039;s becoming the norm.&nbsp; Which really sucks.&nbsp; I would love to enjoy these places more, but at these prices, it won&#039;t happen very often.&nbsp; The less pricier joints will have my business though :)&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ll give these guys another month to work on learning to run their restaurant more smoothly.&nbsp; It&#039;s too expensive to just go and hope for the best.

We went on Saturday and loved it, although I agree with the service issues and that the guac appetizer needed more guac. The high &quot;Manhattan&quot; prices didn&#039;t bother me because I was happy to not have to travel into Manhattan to enjoy the upscale cuisine.

				I&#039;ve lived in Astoria for 5 years &amp; viewed this site many times before, but never felt compelled to reply to any posts. Well, that&#039;s changed. My BF &amp; I were at Mojave for dinner on Saturday night. I&#039;ve been to Agave several times before &amp; always enjoyed the experience. At 6PM when we walked in, the place was empty. However, it filled up quickly. Our waiter was clearly green. In fact, as tables filled up, I heard him tell everyone how nervous he was. He took our orders &amp; a few orders of people nearby &amp; we never saw him again. Literally. We didn&#039;t &quot;think we saw him walk out.&quot; Nope, eventually, when we flagged down another member of the staff, we were told that he quit &amp; he left with the orders. This was after we had waited 60 minutes with no sign of him. We were pretty hungry at this point &amp; since it had been so difficult to make contact with a member of the waitstaff, we just thought it would be easier to leave. The manager assured us our food would be right out. Food was brought out pretty quickly after that, appetizer &amp; entrees at the same time - appx 70 minutes after we orderd. So, we asked them to take the appetizer back. They brought the wrong entree for my BF, but he kept it since it seemed to be easier at that point. The food was very good. I agree the prices are a little expensive, but not outrageous. And yes, we did ask to speak to the manager b/c given what happened to us &amp; those around us, we just wanted them to know took place.<br />I will definitely go back, but it will probably not be for another few weeks. I can understand that opening night might be overwhelming, but the service was truly abhorrent. I am so excited to have a new place in the &#039;hood, that I hope it works out.

				Astorian24 you were very patient, indeed. If that was me, I would&#039;ve walked out! What was that waiter thinking? Astoria residents aren&#039;t ogres! Maybe management thought our little neighborhood would be a good training ground for new employees. <br /><br />Saturday night around 6 PM my BF and I had no idea where to eat and wandered around Ditmars like little lost lambs. I had read about Mojave&#039;s opening night on this board and suggested we check out the menu. When we saw the prices we both had the same thought: too expensive for a place with mixed reviews from Astorians members, so we ate at Wave instead (for the first time believe it or not) and loved it!<br />I have to repeat if I&#039;m going to pay that much for Mexican I&#039;d rather trek to Manhattan (58th and 1st Ave) and eat at Rosa Mexicano&#039;s. We&#039;ve been there twice and each time the service was excellent. Their food is just a bit more expensive, but their table-side guacamole is awesome, the dinners are absolutely delicious (love the filet mignon with mushroom, tequila sauce), desserts are heavenly, and their margaritas (&quot;La Unica&quot; made with reposado 100% blue agave) are fantastic---smooth, but deadly!

				Quick question for those who have been and have had major service problems (like Astorian24): When you complained to management, were you comped at all, or at least offered a free dessert or drink or something comparable? I think this is an important gesture for any restaurant that&#039;s experiencing problems, but especially those that are priced above average.

				Our replacement waitress was really nice &amp; clearly working very hard. She had to ask us for what we had to prepare our bill. I had to leave before the check came, but my BF stayed to deal with it. His plan was just to explain what happened to the mgr. As he spoke to the manager, an older woman (who seemed to have more authority) came over &amp; asked him to repeat himself. At this point, they offered to comp 50% of the bill. Sorry that I didn&#039;t mention that before, I included it in my original post, but somehow it was deleted. I&#039;m new to this, so will have to get the hang of it. On that note, why is there a little envelope (msg?) icon next to my profile? And how do I get rid of it?

				Hi All.&nbsp; Long time reader, not too many posts, but my Husband and I ate at Mojave last night, so I thought I&#039;d post my review.<br />We arrived around 8:30, and the place was about 60% full.&nbsp; We were seated against the wall, and I agree- the bench is a few inches too high, which was a little awkward.&nbsp; They just need thinner cushions.<br />Unlike some others, our service wasn&#039;t too bad.&nbsp; Our waiter was a bit harried, but polite, and our busboy/water guy was *very* attentive (my water glass was never more than 1/2 empty).<br />We must have been a lucky table, because we did receive free nacho chips with 2 types of salsa on out table immediately (the red one was limey and delicious).<br />My husband drank beer, but I had 2 cocktails: the Agave Margarita (on the rocks), which was good but too sweet for me, and the Hot &amp; Spicy, which is a jalapeno infused tequila margarita. YUM. This was an A+ drink for me, I love spicy food and it was served with sliced jalapenos. We ordered the buffalo oysters and guacamole for apps.&nbsp; The sauce I thought was a little overpowering for the oysters, but the texture was beautiful and they were yummy nonetheless.&nbsp; I agree with the other poster who said order your guac sans sourcream- we had about 2 tablespoons of guacamole and a cup each of sour cream and tomatoes.&nbsp; The guacamole itself was good, but not great (I make my own though and am admittedly a guac snob).<br />For entrees, my husband ordered the crab quesadillas and I had the short ribs.&nbsp; My dish was wonderful and huge and he ended up eating half of it!&nbsp; The quesadillas were good too- very full of crab meat and very, very rich.<br />We were given a dessert menu, but were too full (big shock from all of the food we ordered).<br />Overall, it was a nice night out and we will be back.&nbsp; They need to work out some kinks, which I&#039;m sure they will do.&nbsp; I will definitely be back with some girlfriends to enjoy more Hot &amp; Spicys :)

				Help!&nbsp; I don&#039;t mean to sound like an idiot but my husband and I drove along 31st Street between Ditmars and 23rd Avenue three times last night and could not locate the restaurant.&nbsp; Can someone tell me what is right next to it? or on either side of it?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />

				I also ate at Mojave this weekend.. and was thrilled.. Its a great addition to Astoria and a nice deviation from the typical greek, sushi and italian places. I got there earlier than my friend, so I sat at the &quot;bar&quot; which I would not recommend. the bartender didn&#039;t seem to want me there- not even asking if he could get me something until I asked for a drink menu.. the so called bar is also where the waitstaff get their drinks and submit orders.. its not a bar that you would want to sit in... but the meal more than made up for it. Once my friend arrived, we sat promptly in the cozy restaurant.. and ordered.. Yes, we were greeted with nachos and two salsa options. <br />The corn crusted calamari is the best i have ever had.. it actually beats out any Italian-Style fried calamari that i have ever had. it melted in your mouth, as opposed to being over cooked and chewy.. for being fried, it was light and crisp.<br />I had the fajitas and while they didnt come out &quot;sizzling&quot;, they were hot and tasty.. The beef could have been cooked more, the standard is medium, where i prefer well done but the meal was delicious. the flavor was wonderful, the tortillas were light and served warm.<br />my friend had the tuna and enjoyed it. <br />I def recommend Mojave and will be going back... Try it out.&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				This place is very nice.&nbsp; I just went to eat this evening.&nbsp; I was seated right away and the place quickly started to fill up with people.&nbsp; The blue chips are like an appetizer.&nbsp; My sister and I had sangria to start.&nbsp; Then we both ordered the corn on the cob.&nbsp; This was lovely.&nbsp; It was grilled just right.&nbsp; I ordered the jumbo shrimp and my sister had the steak tacos.&nbsp; Both dishes were great.<br /><br />We decided to have a dessert.&nbsp; We ordered the wonderful chocolate molten cake with banana ice cream.&nbsp; YUMMY!&nbsp; They left a nice amount of time before serving the dessert.&nbsp; The chocolate cake also takes a little time to prepare.<br /><br />I would definately recommend it!

				Two questions for those who have gone to Mojave in the past week:<br /><br />1. Were your experiences with the service better than what was described in the first day or two of the opening?<br />2. If you tried the brunch, how is it, and what sort of selection is it?<br /><br />I&#039;m very excited about trying out this place.

				I was there for late brunch on Saturday -- around 4.&nbsp; Margaritas are good but strong.&nbsp; Appetizers are the best.<br /><br />Brunch selection is eggs (including huevos rancheros), pancakes (4 or so kinds), french toast, + sandwich &amp; quesadilla list.<br /><br />Was tasty and very filling.<br /><br />

				There is def. still some kinks being worked out in the service.. for instance my friend ordered the tuna and asked the waitress what comes with it and she said mashed potatoes and asparagus... when the tuna came, it was on sauteed tomatoes and with asparagus. But the waitress gave her a side order of mashed potatoes for free, since it was her mistake. <br /><br />Warning on the <span class="bbc_u">Margarita&#039;s</span>, they are def. strong.. the table next to us returned theirs because they thought they were terrible- not too much tequila, too much lime and super bitter, even with the strawberry flavor. I had the champagne sangria, which was good but expensive ($8 for a tiny glass)..

				I ate here last Tuesday. The waiter we had was a jerk. He was not attentive at all. He brought us the wrong drinks. He didn&#039;t apologize for it. We were there for 2hrs&amp;15min and it wasn&#039;t even busy! He lied straight to our faces when he gave us the check. Thank GOODNESS I had good company, but c&#039;mon!!&nbsp; My chili was AWESOME, and my friend&#039;s butternut squash soup was killer.. but the salmon tacos and the crab quesadilla fell waaaaaaaaaaaay off the mark. Dry - no flavor - bleck. I say stick with their beef/pork dishes. Probably better than any of the seafood.

				I dined at Mojave last week.&nbsp; I have to say that the decor is stunning.&nbsp; Very pretty and upscale restaurant.&nbsp; I had the steak tacos. Very good.&nbsp; The meat was cooked perfectly.&nbsp; Nice portions and great presentations.&nbsp; The wait staff seems knowledgable but they hardly ever came by.&nbsp; At first I asked for a Corona.&nbsp; They came by ten minutes later to say they did not have any more.&nbsp; I then asked for Grey Goose and tonic.&nbsp; Another ten minutes a different waiter came by to inform me they didn&#039;t have it.&nbsp; Since they just opened I just looked at the menu and asked for a good ole margarhita.&nbsp; It was worth the wait.&nbsp; Delicious.&nbsp; I&#039;ll definetely go back.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)

				We had lunch there last friday.&nbsp; Food was excellent, service left a lot to be desired.&nbsp; The waiter didn&#039;t know the menu at all, and it took 45 minutes to get our food.&nbsp; Even though the food was delish, I will probably wait a while to go back-they need to get things running more smoothly.

				Went last night around 9ish. Most of the dinner crowd had left, so place wasn&#039;t as packed. Service was excellent, whether it was as a result of the low number of tables or maybe they have gotten their act together since opening, who is to say. The food, however, was excellent. I orders the fried oysters for an appetizer, and they were nice and spicy. Followed that up with Chicken quesadillas, covered in their mole sauce with some guac on the side and rice...so much food, left in a food coma. For me and one other person, food and drinks (3 beers between us) bill game out to about 65 not inclusive of tip, so I thought it was pretty fairly priced.

				I went tonight with some girlfriends. Overall liked the food, though didn&#039;t try anything ground -breaking. <br /><br />Service was great, if not excessively over-attentive. I&#039;ve never had a busboy remove a fork before,but this guy was just looking for something to do. <br /><br />Regardoing the pricing, it seemed incredibly reasonable to me. Four of us eight, with eight drinks and full entrees and it came to about 124, which I thought was incredibly fair. <br /><br />Atmosphere was beautiful, music was great, and I loved the lighting. The food was good, but not phenomenal.

				I actually went there last night because my friend insisted we try this new place MOJAVE. Southwester cuisine???? didn&#039;t know what to expect exactly, i am visiting a friend just around the corner.<br />As soon as i walked in i was greeted by two Italian accent guys who courteously seated me at a table of my preference, one of them speak also German because he picked up my accent too and asked me how i was and at my request also gave me a good explanation of the NEW MEXICO SANTA FE cuisine in perfect German!!! ( i love NYC). <br /><br />The waiter was a girl and she knew the menu pretty well because i am really not familiar with this type of cuisine, i am from Switzerland here on business. <br />Everything i ordered (which was reccomended) was delivered promptly and the waitress always checked on me during my meal. they were quite busy but yet very organized for a place that has been open only 10 days..<br />Food was good and presentantion nice, in the end i really have to say i liked this place very much. I am definitely going to come back next time i visit.<br />By the way, i work for the Michelin guide for Europe, we do review of restaurant around the globe and i love NYC because you find restaurants like Mojave that are a hidden treasure .

				Dinner their last Friday was okay.<br />The Tuna Sasimi app. was seared served over greens w/ avocado and 2 dressing, we liked the citrus better than the wasabi. The tuna was good :roll:<br />The Steak my friend ordered was not cooked to temp as for my short ribs they were very tasty and tender but they were not in that mole type sauce described on the menu, which was a real bummer.&nbsp; :|<br />As for Drinks the Margaritas on the rocks were great.<br />Our Waiter the tall mid 20 guy was great.<br />And the 2 italos Andrea and Aldo were very nice.<br /><br />Run down based on what we ate: Their food isn&#039;t truly southwest. It is American fair with HINTS of cuisine from all over that is popular. Prices are fair, hey we pay hi rents too and some of us work in NYC why not spend our $ here in the hood? From 1-10 over all: 5. This would be a place where i would have a get together for 6 heads or more, eat a little, talk and drink alot. I like Luna De Juarez more.<br />Ciao a tutti and have a nice Dr.MLK day. :mrgreen:

				My boyfriend went to Mojave last week in the afternoon--around 2ish for a late lunch. Being vegan, I was excited to see &quot;vegan tempah tacos&quot; on the menu. If you&#039;re vegan, this is the ONLY thing you can eat there besides chips and salsa (but being vegan, you&#039;re probably used to this at mainstream restaurants so it&#039;s cool). However, sour cream accompanied the vegan tacos. This annoyed me because obviously sour cream isn&#039;t vegan. I never ever send food back to the kitchen (I&#039;ve heard horror stories from my mom about that who has been a waitress for 25 years) so I ate the taco not touching the sour cream--which was AWESOME--and then scooped out the insides of the other one and mixed it in with the rice that came with it. The food was really very good and the service was ok, but if you go here and are vegan, order the vegan tacos without sour cream. I would go back and do that because I liked the tacos so much.<br />My carnivorous boyfriend ordered the steak quesodilla and said the mushrooms made it a little slimy, but it was ok. However, for the price (13 dollars) he thought it should have come with a side of rice or something. Otherwise he liked it a lot. We didn&#039;t order any alcoholic drinks, but we did get sodas which were 3.00 each and were not offered a refill. <br /><br />

Went there on Monday night for the first time. Our simple dinner at 8:30pm (only about 8 other patrons at the time) lasted until 10:30pm. Ugh. We really liked the food, the ambiance, but the service was killing us. To be honest, our meal came fairly quick, but waiting for the waiter to come around each time was painful. We were probably there 20 minutes before we got a chance to order. My awesome friend who treated is a former waitress and was mentally deducting our waiter&#039;s tip the whole time (I doubt she actually reduced it). <br /><br />I am beginning to wonder - is slow service a part of their shtick?

				I went there last Friday and did not experience a wait at all. The entrees came rather quickly and I think we were out of there in less than an hour. Perhaps they have a bad server or two that need to be weeded out? <br /><br />The beef fajitas and chicken quesadilla was pretty awesome, btw.

				A friend here at work also went last Friday night, around 9:30-ish, and said it was very good.<br />Everyone enjoyed their food and the service was great. They may have one or two servers<br />who aren&#039;t that good and unfortunately if you get them, that can totally ruin your meal.<br /><br />

				Yeah, it must be different waiters.&nbsp; I finally went there a few weeks ago, and it was great.&nbsp; Actually, the waiter was very attentive, and very friendly.&nbsp; I got the short ribs and they were amazing.&nbsp; They don&#039;t give out free nachos, darn.&nbsp; The apps were good and sangria is awesome.&nbsp; Just very expensive.&nbsp; A pitcher of sangria is $32 and they put ice in it!&nbsp; Which is weird and makes for less sangria.&nbsp; Just FYI, ask for no ice.

				Actually maybe that&#039;s not such a bad thing that they don&#039;t automatically put out<br />the chips &amp; salsa. Sometimes we eat so much of that at our regular place that I&#039;m<br />too full for the meal. Might force me to exercise some self-control........

				I agree, it is great to see Mojave engaging with Astorians(.com).&nbsp; I&#039;ve been happy about this addition to the neighborhood, and what looks like a very promising business start.&nbsp; This behavior seems like a good community business model to me.<br /><br />Now that vegetarians like me can look forward to expanding options there, they&#039;re definitely earning my love!

				For all I know it may be fantastic by delivery, but to me it really doesn&#039;t feel like a delivery-type place.&nbsp; It seems like more of a <em>restaurant</em>-restaurant where the dining experience is as important as the food.&nbsp; But that&#039;s just my opinion and the food may be just as enjoyable in your home.

				Thanks to all for posting&nbsp; and also emailing us , we already got a few emails. <br /><br />As for delivery, we just started, and we had a meeting yesterday. We want the food to get well packed and HOT ~~ to the comfort of your home or apartment. (maybe i should make delivery with my vespa). We are getting to know the intricacy and complexity &quot;at least for me&quot; of the streets and avenues. I always lived in Manhattan so, be patient :-)<br /><br />As i stated before, MOJAVE is YOUR restaurant, what i mean is that we are really looking forward to receive emails with suggestions, criticism, and good review to help us grow and little by little&nbsp; with your help become what the neighbourhood need.<br /><br />We are thinking to change a beer (kronnenburg) to something more unique that i think the neighbourhood would love, like a Belgian beer, Trappist maybe so to satisfy the delicate palate of our female clientele. (please email your opinion with your 3 favourite beers)<br /><br />thanks again for your help<br /><br />Mojave mgmt

				My &quot;delicate female palate&quot; loves a good sangria and yours is quite delicious (both the red and the white) but I think it is very expensive for the amount that you get in a pitcher.&nbsp; It only filled four glasses which doesn&#039;t make it a bargain at $32 verses the single serve $8 glass.&nbsp; My suggestion is to either lower the price, leave out the ice, or serve it in bigger pitchers.&nbsp;

				Hey, Mojave, thanks for being a part of the conversation, this is great.&nbsp; Not many restaurants engage their clientèle and it&#039;s encouraging, positive, and welcome.&nbsp; We&#039;ve all been very excited to have a Southwestern/Mexican restaurant in this area, and it&#039;s 100 times better than another fast food joint.&nbsp; It&#039;s great to be able to go somewhere and have margaritas and stumble on home in your own hood.&nbsp; <br /><br />I second the sangria suggestion.&nbsp; I LOVED it, but yeah, no ice please.&nbsp; It makes it hard to get at the fruit too and that&#039;s the best part!&nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe that would make for 5 glasses as opposed to 4?

				Nice to see you here, Mojave!&nbsp; My &quot;delicate&quot; (er. . . :?) female palate loves beers from the Victory Brewing Company (http://www.victorybeer.com/home.html), specifically:<br /><br />Storm King Stout (http://www.victorybeer.com/storm_king.html) (year-round)<br />Baltic Thunder (http://www.victorybeer.com/beers.html)<br />Old Horizontal barleywine (http://www.victorybeer.com/old_horizontal.html)<br />St. Victorious (http://www.victorybeer.com/st_victorious.html)<br /><br />Those are mostly seasonal, but Victory has a great selection of year-round beers as well.&nbsp; There are several restaurants and bars in Astoria that serve Victory beer, and I&#039;d be happy to see you add some to your menu.<br /><br />I also really like fresh hop ale, like Sierra Nevada&#039;s Harvest Fresh Hop Ale (http://www.sierranevada.com/beers/harvest.html).<br /><br />I&#039;ve enjoyed several of your margarita offerings (including the jalapeno margarita), and found your mojito refreshing and delicious (even though I don&#039;t usually like sweet or mixed drinks).

				Went here last Sunday with my BF.&nbsp; It&#039;s very attractive.&nbsp; I have to say I wasn&#039;t crazy about the brunch menu, though - both in selection and in what we chose.&nbsp; He had the caesar salad with chicken which was surprisingly dull (even for caesar salad) - and I had - I don&#039;t know what it was called but it was basically over-spiced chopmeat that was fried and greasy that was supposed to be over rice but I asked them for salad instead (which they kindly agreed to).<br /><br />The benches, as already mentioned numerous times, are too high, they should change that if possible because had it been dinner it would have been too uncomfortable.&nbsp; The music was BLARING AND WE WERE SCREAMING AT EACH OTHER - and while I love salsa and the like I thought it was rather loud for (a) mid-day, and (b) a restaurant, not a club.&nbsp; Lastly, I thought the prices were too high for this neighborhood.&nbsp; It&#039;s not manhattan, and it&#039;s not park slope - it&#039;s Astoria.&nbsp; They weren&#039;t outrageous, just off by a few dollars.<br /><br />I&#039;ll definitely try this place again, I would like to try the dinner menu, and I think that most places deserve a second chance.<br /><br />

				I can&#039;t say about the lunch and dinner menu, i have only had Brunch there, and that&#039;s what I was commenting on. The menu is limited (which has already been posted on the board), and the prices are higher than any other brunch I have seen in Astoria. <br /><br />If the dinner menu is better thought out then best of luck to them.<br /><br />I was really hoping for finally getting decent mexican food in the nabe, or at least a margarita fix during the summer. Hopefully they will have specials when the weather gets warmer.

				Hi to all, i have been reading your posts and i am really sorry that some of you had encountered some problems with us. It was not in our intentions to serve you with something that you didn&#039;t like. Next time that some of you encouter this, please call Aldo or Andrea and we will make sure you get RIGHT AWAY something else that you like. I would prefer that when something like this happen you call the waiter and tell them to replace the dish for something else, we rather lose some dishes you didn&#039;t like than lose an unhappy customer..... so PLEASE&nbsp; ASK!!!<br /><br />SANGRIA- we went ahead and REMOVED almost all the ice form the pitcher , and off course as per your request added extra fruit, which makes the sangria taste even better like some emails&nbsp; i receive says.&nbsp; THANKS for the suggestion MagicPie &amp; daisy,&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />As per BRUNCH, i received some emails very positive but as i see on the board people are saying that we are on the expensive side. As my defense i just want to point out the fact that we use ONLY organic, cage free chicken eggs and also the rest of the ingredients are organic as well. As well everything is prepared at the moment!!! no precook is being made in our kitchen EVER!!!! As i repeat, if you don&#039;t like something or have questions please ask us, don&#039;t be afraid..<br /><br />we are working also on a new organic herbal , SUGAR FREE ICE TEA, which is sweetened in the brewing&nbsp; process with fresh fruits, please ask for a sample when you come in...<br /><br />thanks again for your criticism.<br /><br />PS, as for the high benches, we replaced the thick foamy cushions with a really thin ones trying to solve the problem.&nbsp;

				We ate at Mojave on Friday night and I have to say that the overall experience has improved a thousand fold since we were there on opening night.&nbsp; Our Waitress, Kim, was AMAZING and very attentive even though she had a huge section to look over.&nbsp; The food continues to be wonderful as well.<br /><br />It&#039;s great to see that management is taking such an active interest in our thoughts here.&nbsp; If only other restaurants in the area would do the same thing I&#039;d never have to leave Ditmars for a superior dining experience!<br /><br />Keep up the good work!

				I&#039;m really interested in how some savvy restaurateur&#039;s read their reviews and threads on this site. It&#039;s beyond smart, it&#039;s becoming a necessity in operating a business, especially a restaurant where so much is spread word of mouth. It&#039;s very neat to see it in action- it really speaks to the ways we communicate and evolve now. The people who use this board are the core of the neighborhood in many ways- at least the core that is digitally vocal- and these are the people who will be the consistent customer base. It&#039;s really very cool to see the feedback.

				And actually, I don&#039;t think you (Mojave)&nbsp; have to defend your prices too much, because honestly, Ditmars has always been an area with expensive restaurants - take Trattoria L Incontro, 718, Olivo, Mezzo, Oceano, that new Greek place on 23rd Ave...&nbsp; As long as the quality of the food and service matches the price, it shouldn&#039;t be an issue.&nbsp; You will succeed.

				Sounds great and it&#039;s fantastic to have owners who are really listening to the community. Two questions -- is there someplace to find the menu online (or is the menu identical to Agave)? and how does the restaurant feel about substitutions/modifying an order? My gf is a very picky vegetarian who is more likely to modify a meat dish (like hold the chicken) instead of going for the vegetarian selection (which usually has other ingredients she&#039;s not a fan of). Anyone ask to modify a dish?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				My wife and I finally went there and frankly, we were disappointed.<br /><br />We liked the locale/decor, the menu seemed varied and reasonably priced. The food was.... OK. Lacked a little &#039;umph&#039;, not necessarily spiciness, just flavor and temperature heat. The food came rather quickly so I was surprised that it wasn&#039;t that hot. I got the feeling they rushed our order, which is odd since it wasn&#039;t crowded.<br /><br />Aside from temperature, my dish wasn&#039;t cooked to order, either (too rare). And for my wife, they brought her the wrong item.<br /><br />The service was hands-down one of the worst I&#039;ve experienced. I could go on and on, but my justifiably low tip (and I&#039;m a generous tipper) reflects how dissatisfied we were with our waiter. Unattentive, ill-informed and tactless. We had more interaction with the manager and the food expediter (who were both super-polite, BTW) than him.<br /><br />Next time we go -- and we resolved to try it again -- I will make absolutely sure we don&#039;t have that waiter again.

				The negative experiences really surprise me. I&#039;ve gone to Mojave twice now, once for lunch and once for dinner. Both times the food was fantastic and the service was good. I did have a similar problem that others have had the second time, I ordered the buffalo oysters and they brought me the buffalo wings. But I told them and they had my oysters (which were amazing by the way!) out to me within a couple of minutes. Also the Queso Fundido there is phenomenal, if only I wasn&#039;t too proud to lick the bowl clean...&nbsp; :-) <br /><br />When a friend and I went for lunch I had the Chicken Quesadilla, which I thought was a terrific mix of flavor with a little bit of spice. My friend had the Chicken Club which was also very good especially with that chorizo on it. <br /><br />About a week later I went with another friend for dinner and had the Blue Corn Enchiladas which I was very happy with. The mole sauce had just enough of the chocolate flavor to make it feel a little more authentic to the southwest/mexican style cooking than a lot of other places. My friend had the Winter Green salad, and asked that they hold the goat cheese and put some grilled chicken on it for her instead, which they seemed to have no problem doing. The salad was good and the dressing was fantastic! At the end while we were waiting for our plates to be cleared she tried dipping chips into the dressing which turned out to be really tasty. To my undiscerning palette, it tasted like the dressing was based on peanut oil which gave it a much richer, nuttier flavor that worked really well with the salad, and the chips! :-D<br /><br />Both times I went I had a margarita... or two... and was happy with all of them. I could definitely tell that they were strong but I didn&#039;t feel like it was overly strong... if that makes sense. At dinner my friend had the Red Sangria, and while it was my first time trying sangria I had nothing to compare it to, she loved it and said it was some of the best sangria she&#039;s had.<br /><br />I definitely look forward to going back many times to what I&#039;m pretty sure has become my new favorite restaurant...&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				At this point, my husband and I tried this place twice. It&#039;s not bad, however, they need to do a lot more work.<br />First Time:<br />I asked the server what tequila was used in their margarita - answer &quot;don&#039;t know&quot;<br />While taking my order (slow braised short ribs) - server asked what temperature I want that cooked - Funny<br />Then, I finished eating before my husband, they tried to take my plate away, (made my husband stop eating).<br />Then, no one came around, couldn&#039;t find the server. I needed the check. Took awhile.<br />Second Time:<br />Server and busboy kept coming over to my table constantly and refilling my water glass. Very anoying, every time I took a sip, they refilled it again. Should probably wait till it&#039;s at least half way.<br />Busboy opened both of the front doors, I was freezing, had to put my coat on.<br />When the runner brought the food, I said to put the plates in the center - that we are sharing, he put the place in front of me - so I said again to put in the center - I think he didn&#039;t understand English.<br />Overall the food is good and drinks are strong, but the staff is still not properly trained.<br /><br /><br />

				I just have to post. My husband and I are from Texas and we LOVE Mojave. I&#039;m actually shocked that people have had such bad experiences. I&#039;m not saying that bad service doesn&#039;t happen (here or anywhere, because it definitely does), but I think so much of your experience is in your expectations. If you go in expecting to have a nice meal and good service, then that&#039;s what you&#039;ll get. Also, everyone is different. The first time we went to Mojave, our waiter kept pronouncing &quot;quesadillas&quot; with an L instead of Y (think armadillo instead of...well, I can&#039;t think of another word with the eee-ya sound, but you get the idea). I thought it was charming and kind of funny, my husband thought it was lame. So, I guess that proves my point: I am an optimist and my husband is...not an optimist.<br /><br />Anyway, back to my experiences and away from my philosophizing on the impact expectations have on experience. I&#039;ve had the carne asada quesadillas, the beef tacos (forget the real name) and the short ribs. The short ribs were unbelievably good...so delicious I wish I could eat them every day. Very tender and well-seasoned. The guac was also very good. My husband is in love with the chicken fried steak (the first time we&#039;ve seen it since leaving Texas!) and really enjoyed the chili as well. I actually liked the chicken fried steak and I usually don&#039;t like chicken fried steak. The gravy is just amazing. And back to the chili, it&#039;s made with real beef, not ground beef. That really makes a big difference. He ordered the pork with apple cider vinegar once (again, forgot the Mojave name) and neither of us liked that too much, but it wasn&#039;t bad. Oh, and we didn&#039;t enjoy the onion rings very much either -- they weren&#039;t crispy enough. The taste was good though.<br /><br />I really want to try their burger. It sounds good and I love finding tasty burgers.<br /><br />Their rocks margaritas are also really good (and strong, as others have mentioned). I really like the pomegranate. I didn&#039;t love the agave nectar as much as the pomegranate. My husband just gets the plain. We always get it on the rocks; the one time he ordered a frozen margarita it was NOT GOOD and we actually complained to our waiter. And we never complain. They were great though and didn&#039;t charge us for it.<br /><br />One other note. We&#039;ve always gone on weeknights. Maybe that is the trick? Go when they are a little less busy? Oh, I take that back; we went to Mojave on Valentine&#039;s and they were packed. We still had great service and a great meal.<br /><br />I lied; one other other note. I really appreciate that the owner/manager reads the message board. Kudos to you. Keep up the good work!

				Hey Mojave,<br /><br />Again let me say how awesome it is that you not only read the comments but actually post as well. I am super psyched about the possibility of an after-work happy hour! And 4 to 7 is just right for me because I get back to the &#039;hood at about 6, so I have enough time for a drink or two, but not three or four, which is never a good idea for me on a weeknight. Yay! Can&#039;t wait.<br /><br />Oh, and I personally wouldn&#039;t be into the 10-midnight happy hour most nights, but it would be a fun option from time to time. I&#039;m sure other people who aren&#039;t as boring as me would enjoy it. ;)

				MegC and I had dinner with a bunch of friendly Astorians there about a week ago. It was a great space to meet in- great ambiance, you could actualy hear conversation - but the food wasn&#039;t very inspired. I had a chicken quesadilla and meg had a chicken mole&nbsp; thingee...<br />I was hoping for more of a &quot;pop&quot; or an &quot;Ole!&quot; but no such luck.&nbsp; The service was a bit pokey as well.&nbsp; To be fair, we were warned about the mildness of food.

				Hallo everybody, thanks again for posting and writing....<br /><br />From tomorrow we are going to have HAPPY HOURS..&nbsp; I never worked in a place that implemented happy hours, so i hope it&#039;s not going to backfire on me. The happy hours will be weekdays from 4 to 7 pm and also from 10 till closing i am thinking about extending the nights to an everyday happy hours.. The prices are $5 for all house cocktails and $3 for draft beer, Sierra Nevada and dos xx are really good. and now we finally perfectioned the SANGRIA.&nbsp; i am sure you will like it, it comes with fresh fruit left in the wine for 1-2 days.. and very very very little ice.....<br /><br />Anyway, for who of you write in this site i would to offer you an afterdinner drink when you mention about astorians.com <br /><br /><br />thanks again<br />

				We FINALLY had dinner at Mojave last night and really enjoyed it.<br /><br />The space is very relaxing and comfortable. Our waiter was great about<br />explaining the dishes we were interested in and made spot-on recommendations<br />that we were pleased with.<br /><br />I had the pepper-crusted salmon filet w/sauteed spinach with a spring roll appetizer.<br />My boyfriend had their corn-coated calamari with two sauces and a chicken enchilada<br />with a yummy mole sauce. <br /><br />The red sangria is just right - not too sweet and a nice change my usual wine or margarita.<br /><br />Service was fast - it was pretty empty at 5:00 on Sunday afternoon, but we had theatre tix<br />so we were glad. <br /><br />Dessert menu was tempting, but we were too full. Next time.<br /><br />I hope Mojave does well - I&#039;m seeing too many local businesses closing down so hopefully <br />they&#039;ll be around for a long time.

				Just wanted to offer my 2 cents...<br /><br />My husband and I had dinner at Mojave the Saturday night before last. It was crowded but the host quickly brought us to a cozy table towards the back in between two empty tables which was lovely. I like the decor and the seperate bar section in the back. Im sure we will visit that in the future. The techno music was a little loud but since the restaurant was full of talking tables.. I understand.<br /><br />&nbsp;Kevin was our waiter (i believe that someone else on here complimented him as well), and he was wonderful. We will definitely be back to see him. He was charming and ready to answer any questions we had (esp since this was our first visit). We never had to flag him down and even though he had many many tables to attend to, he always showed up to ask us if we wanted more drinks before they were empty. Also (and this is an intangible thing)...but my husband and I were clearly exhausted but still &quot;on a rare date&quot; and our conversations were never interrupted. I have worked in restaurants and I have to say, it is a real plus to have servers that can quickly read the customer and create a wonderful environment specific to the situation.<br /><br />On to the food.....The chips and two types of salsa that we recieved beforehand were good but the quantities of the yummy salsa were way too small, even for 2 people. But I have to say, the serving dish for the salsas was cute so maybe the form won out over functionality there? <br /><br />My husband had the Jumbo Gulf Shrimp w/tomato garlic sauce and arroz verde and I had the Blue Corn Chicken Enchiladas. Both were great, came out quickly and the portions were more than adequate. I thought it was interesting that we were asked about any special condiments we like BEFORE the food came out. That way, we never had to wait and ask. Why dont all restaurants do that? <br /><br />My margaritas were particularly good. No sour mix to give me heartburn...only fresh lime juice the way it should be. And my husband loves tequila and they have several good ones on the menu to choose from.<br /><br />So all in all, we will be back....it is pricier than other Astoria mex establishments, but I feel like it is justified. It was a relaxing meal out that exceeded our expectations. And we dont have the time to do that everynight...<br /><br />I mean, I love cheap taco carts just like anyone else but you arent paying for environment/service/etc in that situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;:mrgreen:<br /><br /><br />

				Mother&#039;s Day, we would like to extend a free infused Margarita to all the people the will dine with us. I don&#039;t know how many of you came the cinco de mayo, but it was a lot of fun. we had over 400 people that dinner and we clearly didn&#039;t expect such a huge response. we had to stop deliverying because of too many people waiting to be seated. Thanks for coming, next time i promise wi will be more organized so that everybody can be served and so that we don&#039;t have to turn away as many people as we did on monday. If you want to take a look at the pictures http://picasaweb.google.com/mojavenyc <br /><br />we are also going to have a cinco de mayo every thursday with live music from 6:30 to 10:00. we will probably offer to all the diners a free frozen margarita, just to start the engines....&nbsp; Let us know your ideas.<br /><br />Also we are going to open up the garden in the back soon, we will fit probably 100 people....<br /><br />waiting to hear from you..<br /><br />thanks

				My husband and I ate here a week ago. The food was good, my butternut squash soup was amazing, I&#039;m definately coming back for that. The entree&#039;s were very good as well, my steak fajita was great. The marinade they used for the steak was really tasty. I need to try dessert here but I was too stuffed at the time. The cons are the bus boy threw away our food after my husband asked him to wrap it up to go. He didn&#039;t understand our request and just tossed it. The portions were so huge we could have had another meal out of it. I&#039;m not upset that he threw it out, just confused that the bus boys should only have to know a few phrases in English, &quot;can I take that to go&quot; or &quot;can you wrap that up&quot; should be taught to the bus boys. We&#039;ll be back though.

				Tried Mojave on Saturday and was not really impressed. The ambiance is nice however the location, on a busy block on 31st street (aka under the train) is not the most ideal. The drinks were not that great...our table had mojitos and capirinha&#039;s (spelling??) and the consensus was that they all missed the mark... <br /><br />The food was okay....had the short ribs...which were on the bone...not my fav. and were somewhat tough and not tender. All in all, it was just an okay dinner. There are many other options in the hood that I would much more like to drop cash for a nice dinner. <br /><br />Recommendation: Try it if you are curious but don&#039;t go expecting an amazing meal. <br /><br />

				i was actually in mojave tonight, monday night. The food was delicious, and the prices are not expensive at all. off course IMHO astoria is in for a change in quality, and i think that some &quot;old residents&quot; still think of astoria as suburbia. I think that places like mojave and some pizza places on 31st &quot;2.50 for a slice&quot; are adapting to the current prices, and instead of cutting in quality they raise the prices a bit. I rather spend the few extra bucks and eat quality food, than save and eat the average. I really liked the &quot;short ribs&quot; in mojave, but not everybody knows the prices of shortribs fo angus beef, it&#039;s quite expensive. i know that ossobuco &quot;similar to the shortribs&quot; now goes for 35$ in almost all the restaurants, and it costs me at the supermarket almost 20... plus 5 hours cooking and seasoning and rice and the rest... well, here we are at the wooping price of the restaurant.

				I went to Mojave three times in the last two weeks.<br /><br />1st -- Brunch with my man two weekends ago. It was a last minute decision before we headed into Manhattan. I had the steak and eggs and he had the heuvos rancheros (sp?). We were both thrilled with the food and with the discounted margaritas that came with the breakfast. Service was fast, friendly and knowledgable. We had such a great time and were so stoked with the qualities of the drinks, food and service that we came back the next Thursday for dinner.<br /><br />2nd -- Thursday dinner with my man last week. I had the Tejas shrimp and he had the porkchops. I stuck with the margarita, he tried a cocktail. The waiter was great, helped us pick items and went out of his way to help me pay the bill without my boyfriend knowing! (That always makes me happy.) Everything was perfect for the price (we each had two drinks, split appetizers and desert and it came out to less than $80) and the atmosphere was great with the live music. The hosting staff had seated everyone very intelligently to keep the music far, but not too far.<br /><br />3rd -- This past Sunday we were starving and needed brunch and decided to go back to Mojave to try their sandwiches. We got there around noon and had a hard time deciding what we wanted. The drinks were great, again, but the food came slower than last time. It looks like it was because we ordered more of a lunch-y selection than the breakfast stuff. I know restaurants get into rythmns and we must&#039;ve not been spot on. Our waitress this time, though, was not very good. I&#039;m hoping that she was just new to the restaurant because she didn&#039;t seem to know what was on the menu, what things came with and seemed to have a hard time understanding our orders. We both ordered sandwiches and got a side of fries to split and she didn&#039;t tell us the sandwiches came with fries. The food and drinks were great, as always, but we didn&#039;t stay for the second drink like we usually do because of the awkward service.<br /><br />Basically, if we&#039;d had the third experience two weekends ago, we wouldn&#039;t have had the others. It&#039;s nice to know that it&#039;s just hit or miss service, but hopefully they can get all of the waitstaff on the page of the two excellent servers we had.

				I ate at Mojave for the first time yesterday.&nbsp; At first, I was slightly disappointed because on the weekends, they only offer the brunch menu until 4:00.&nbsp; The brunch menu is less extensive than the full menu, specifically, there were almost no vegetarian dishes.&nbsp; There was a quesadilla with asparagus and tomatoes, but I can&#039;t have tomatoes and I don&#039;t like asparagus.&nbsp; When I told the waiter my concerns, he was extremely helpful.&nbsp; He immediately suggested substitutions and I ended up having a quesadilla with artichokes instead.&nbsp; It was very good and the service was awesome!&nbsp; I&#039;m incredibly impressed and cannot wait until I go there again!&nbsp;

				John has fallen in love with this place all over again. To the point HE wants to take MY MOM out to dinner here. She will be off her ass with one margarita, no doubt.<br />I can&#039;t wait to go back for dinner and try the sangria, always looking for good sangria (had really bad sangria at spanish taverna in manhattan last month, blech)<br />We&#039;ve done brunch twice in July and both times were spot on. They were even able to accomodate our friend crutchy magee, who at that point was actually getting around with a walker. John tried the brunch that involved blue crab and eggs in some sort of vessel, and he about creamed himself at the table he thought it was soooo good. <br />I need to venture out from quesadilla land. Sometimes i&#039;m just jonesing for one, and as long as they hold off the peppers it&#039;s gravy baby.

				Time Out should be down on one of the best places in our neighborhood.&nbsp; They must have gone in with the wrong preconceptions (did they think it was Mexican rather than South Western?) or maybe hit an off night (every place has them).&nbsp; I love the food and the drinks at Mohave - it&#039;s a great place - I just wish it was on Broadway!

				Was really surprised by the bad Time out article but for a different reason.&nbsp; They NEVER give a bad review. Must have been a really off night for Mojave.&nbsp; Not a fan myself. The food is bland to lack luster. The service, decor and drinks are very good though.&nbsp; The are such better choices in the &#039;hood for Mexican or whatever style they are claiming.&nbsp; Too bad because it is such a nice place. A real Manhattan quality establishment, except for the food.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				i&#039;ve seen time out give plenty of bad reviews to places. you can read the review here (http://www.timeout.com/newyork/articles/restaurants-bars/46691/mojave), but basically i think they just panned mojave because southwestern food isn&#039;t hip to them right now. admittedly i&#039;ve not been to mojave yet, but between the reviews on yelp and the number of people i see in there as i pass by, i&#039;m willing to chalk it up to either a bad night, or a whiny reviewer.

				Doesn&#039;t surprise me at all.&#160; The first time I tried Mojave I thought the food was edible but nothing to write home about.&#160; The service was awful.&#160; I figured they just didn&#039;t have it together yet so went back about a month or 2 later and the service improved but the food is just not that good.&#160; Much better Mexican elsewhere in the hood.

				nycParkie, I have to completely agree with you here. I remembering ordering that hash...I was very unhappy to get a bowl of potato soup instead. I think the drinks are great, maybe an app to share but if I&#039;m taking out of towners to dinner, I don&#039;t take them here...maybe Stamatis, Sparrow, Bistro, Watawa or Fattys. Much more consistent. I just go to Mojave to drink at the bar now after several unimpressive expensive meals. Im sorry!

				Mojave is the best place to get a nice, well-seasoned, cooked to order steak in the Ditmars area that I&#039;ve found. The steak and eggs brunch is $11 and is a good hunk of meat that they prepare very well. I love me some steak and eggs. I&#039;ll get a side of the guac and it goes great with the steak. The shrimp and crab I&#039;ve had at Mojave is also amazing.<br /><br />I think that certain things (a southwestern Shephard&#039;s Pie?) just sound ridiculous and aren&#039;t my style, so I don&#039;t get them. There are other items (like some of the traditional Mexican stuff) that I feel are good, but there are better values on the menu. I think what you order has a lot to do with it.<br /><br />I&#039;ll keep going back for brunch and dinners. There just isn&#039;t anywhere else I&#039;ve found close by that has the quality of steak that they do.<br /><br />

				I have been eating at Mojave quite a few times, the quality of food is top quality, the only drawback is that sometimes is not prepared as it should. What i mean is that even the best quality of items can taste bad if not prepared with care. I think that Mojave read the review and will take care of it.. they really accept criticism, and in the end it will work out better for us.<br />I read the earlier review, about the sangria, the cocktails and some other stuff. I have seen that whatever astorians complained and discussed in this board HAVE been corrected and fixed. The sangria is now perfect, with little ice and lots of fresh fruit. their cocktail list is almost tripled and is not that expensive for the quantity they give you.<br /><br />Personally, i am sorry about bad reviews about Mojave but i am also glad because i am positive that they will do anything in their possibilities to change.<br /><br />as your review NYCparkie, i am sorry, but you seem to have posted only one review, and usually i don&#039;t consider a first bad review.. Regarding CHOWHOUND.. A friend of mine is a critic that works for chowhound, and after what i saw, i never take them seriously. He gets free meals in most of the restaurants he reviews...

No one even attempted to talk to me about it to determine if I was genuine or not, and there was never a chance for discussion of the restaurant since the thread was deleted so quickly. It was really weird.<br /><br />Anyway, as for Mojave, I&#039;m not going to write it off because of this review. Honestly the description of the shepherd&#039;s pie from that review sounds kind of tasty to me (anyone else? :|), though I wouldn&#039;t pay Mojave prices for something like that.

				Fellow Astorians,<br /><br />We couldn&#039;t belive the review in Timeout, I was like Damn do they have something personal with the owner here or what! :|<br /><br />So i went to Timeout and it looks like i was the 1st to voice a comment and it followed like this (if they will post it remains to be seen).<br /><br />&quot;I don&#039;t think this review was fair. We eat their 3 times a month since they opened and really enjoy there food, drinks and atmosphere.<br />Their Caesar is spot on, Short ribs ROCK, Swordfish excel, fried Oysters nice with one of there 4 tap beers. Oh and the Chef salad with steak. Perfect for the price.<br />Perhaps Tony should swing by again and Take a shot of the Punisher.&nbsp; :-D<br />Maybe she could be the 20,050person to check out the thread on Astorians.com.&quot; <br />(i and the owner of La Pequena Colombia, Dimitri, were the 20,000th, YESS)<br /><br />So the BEST news of the week- The Garden in the Back is looking really nice, I was certainly positivly surprised.<br /><br />In the restaurant business only time can tell if you are good or not. And i am putting my Mula right in the new Jardin del Paradiso, Orale Buell! :lol:

				<br />I&#039;ve been to Mojave once, and I thought it was OK. I would go back. There is a nice vibe/ambiance, and I really liked how the space was designed and laid out.<br /><br />My only complaint, and this goes for any place that serves Margaritas:<br /><br /><strong>Please, please, please use sea salt/margarita salt and NOT TABLE SALT!</strong> :-P<br /><br />am I the only one who thinks using table salt ruins an otherwise good margarita?

				You will see I posted previously about how on two other occasions i greatly enjoyed mojave, well after tonight&#039;s trip, i have to agree with the majority of the posts here that it was just not good. <br /><br />they opened a new back yard patio which is very nice - but doesn&#039;t make up for the bland food or terrible waitstaff. <br />Our waitress was kind, checked in and knew her menu. she recommended some things to the table and we each got one of her recommendations. I had the short ribs and my companion had the meatloaf. <br /><br />He enjoyed his, or rather did not complain to me if he did not. <br /><br />However, <br />1. we were not even 1/2 way through our guacomole when they came out with our entrees and removed the appetizer we paid $15 for. <br />2. the guacamole was mostly chopped tomatoes and sour cream with a small tablespoon of actual guac in a fried shell.<br />3. my short ribs were bland, on the bone and very fatty, the sauce they were in was watered down and lacked-flavor.<br />4. we were not even done with our drinks and they were clearing the plates<br />5. the constantly kept saying, &quot;are you done&quot;, &quot;miss, take away&quot; for everything we touched. i took a sip of my full drink and they wanted to take it away already. the restaurant was not packed and it was not closing time, so there was no reason to be rushed out, unless of course they didnt want us there... <br /><br />Besides for the variety of mojitos, both flavors and tequila, vodka or rum options, I&#039;m not sure i&#039;d go back again...<br /><br />BTW, they didnt increase the size of the portion of the free salsa and chips you get on arrival. the salsas are still teaspoon portion each and they lack true flavor, very liquid. <br /><br /><br />

				I was in Mojave Saturday night, in the patio... it looks really nice, the service to me was good, and the food too. I was in a rush to go to the movie, but i was able to finish the salad and then after 5 minutes the main course arrived... they told me that the patio was closed and only few people were allowed tonight to try the kitchen and the new waitstaff. so i was warned in case of any mistake. well i have nothing bad to write because to my table everything was perfect. And it did happened in other places that the food was rushed.. not a big deal.. i just speak up and tell the waiter to hold it a couple of extra minutes, or if it&#039;s a salad i just move the salad on the side.. no big deal...<br /><br /><br />PS - I have to point out that sometimes when i go out with my coworker and his boyfriend (a gay couple) they seem to attract&nbsp; a bad vibe, i just tell them to relax and stop complaining.... what can i say... i guess i am a simple person.

Nothing against being gay please, i love the gay community, just pointing out that when i was there with my 2 friends they were really excessive in demandind things, lika primadonnas..&nbsp; that&#039;s all. I am surprised that mojave sometimes put up with those requests...

				I agree.&nbsp; Some of their stuff is overpriced.&nbsp; I don&#039;t mind paying if it tastes great but I didn&#039;t enjoy some of these items such as:<br /><br />Chicken wings - I ordered this appetizer when Mojave first arrived and I was disappointed at how dry and sort of tasteless they were.<br />Grilled corn on the cob - I guess it&#039;s my fault since I was kind of expecting a whole <span class="bbc_u">grilled</span> corn prepared Cuban style (similar to Cafe Havana in Manhattan) but instead got a small stub of corn that wasn&#039;t grilled (pos. steamed or boiled?) and wasn&#039;t very flavorful.<br />Chicken Pot Pie - This dish varies.&nbsp; Sometimes the chicken is cooked properly and the crust is crisp and flaky.&nbsp; Other times the chicken is really tasteless and chewy and the crust is soggy.<br />Steak Taco - The steak was chewy.<br /><br />The only items I seem to enjoy every time I order is the quesadillas (esp. the shrimp, the steak and the chicken), some of their brunch/lunch menu items, and their garlicky fries. I order the burger at times although this one varies too in the way it&#039;s cooked (sometimes it&#039;s over or under cooked based on what I ask for) and how they salt it (way too much salt at times where I had a hard time eating it).&nbsp; I enjoy their drinks and haven&#039;t had a bad experience with any of them.&nbsp; I really like the atmosphere and every time I go or order delivery I receive great, prompt service.

				Finally got around to trying it tonight. Had the vegetable spring rolls, salmon tacos, seared ahi tuna and fruity iced tea. <br /><br />The lime sauce for the rolls was wonderful, though probably just a twist on the sweet/sour sauce you get at any Chinese restaurant now that I think about it! Tuna had too much going on; really good seared tuna doesn&#039;t need a whole lot else. But the BF enjoyed it. Salmon tacos were very good- simple, but all sides fresh and flavorful. Oh yeah, those tomato bits on everything were especially tasty. Excellent little touch. Fruity iced tea was <em>meh.</em><br /><br />I wasn&#039;t at all keen on the prices, like stated already, this would be an occasional extravagance for me since I kept thinking how other local places had similar items for much cheaper. <br /><br />That bar and those mixed drinks sure did look good, though...!

				i&#039;ve been to mojave a hand full of times now and i have to say it&#039;s really not worth the bucks. on my last visit the unfriendly waiter brought our food and it was literally cold. not even room temperature, just cold as if it had just been in the fridge. we had to send it back to be heated up and i never send food back. after we were done eating the waiter disappeared for 20 minutes. we actually had to ask another waiter for our check. the service is inexcusibly awful and the food is mediocre. on a positive note, it didn&#039;t induce any violent bowel movements on us. save your money...

				Mojave gave you the runs?? That is funny, i should go there more often then, i go there 2 times a week, and i suffer from constipation... damn..why that didn&#039;t happened to me..<br />Anyway, you review was not nice but CREATIVE though, i mean, i had the runs 3 times in IGLOO and never said anything to anybody. Plus the fact that also your cousin and relative had the same problem is way too much of a coincidence.<br />&nbsp;Talking about expensive? the pizza next to the train is $2.50 for a tiny square slice, and you need at least 3 to feel satisfied.&nbsp; I talk with a lot of people in the hood, and we don&#039;t think places like mojave, 718, or watawa are expensive at all, Astoria is changing, and if some thinks that places like these are too expensive, then they should move to corona. I mean, Trattoria l&#039;incontro is really expensive, food ok but still i go there many times per month as well, rocco is a really nice guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;I have seen many mean reviews in astorians.com but i have to say that Mojave have really started something. I go there often, and i have to tell you the truth, i am shocked that some astorians are so against new businesses that are doing well. I mean to say it to people that think that these placese are too pricey, service sucks (like the review i just read about watawa (please give me break), food not that good. As a customers i will speak up for the managers as well, which are too nice to defend themselves in this board.<br />Did you know that 2 of the business around Mojave (2 other food establishments) CALLED the health department 2 times during the month of august and some neighbors called the building department 7 times to stop the construction of their backyard, and they also received visits from the fire department because some customer was smoking in their backyard. (you can check all that on the building department, is there to be seen by everybody). Their front flowers were trashed a few times, and also they got things stolen too from their backyard, (that i read on this board) How do i know this things??? I live in the neighbourhood for quite a few years now and i eat out every night because i love food,&nbsp; By the way, i am not GREEK, i am Italia - AMERICAN. Sorry Greek people for intruding in YOUR neighborhood, but is still in a the USA in case you didn&#039;t know. I mean what is all this venom..I have never seen anything like that, and Mojave is not the only one, i can name you a few others that are having problems with already established (Greek) businesses. I was there last night in Mojave and they were totally packed, i mean like swamped like never before and the manager Andrea was telling me that 2 waiters called in sick that day. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised to read bad review now about the bad service, but i got my service well taken care of, so no complaints for me. I don&#039;t want to badmouth other establishments, but there are places that really delivers BAD service and also ATTITUDE, like one Greek restaurant i go.. so what, s___ happens.<br /><br />I am sorry to have intruded like thins in this board, but i feel like someone should have spoke up from the Mojave management against all the bad staff that they are fighting against..

				I will have to try Mojave for sure, now. I don&#039;t like the above negative reviews of dubious origin. Their prices might be on the high side, but I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll be able to find something within my budget, especially since the owners seem very nice and are sincerely trying to please Astorians.<br /><br />Seems like the restaurant business can be pretty cut-throat around here.<br /><br />(Anastasia- I think I know which Greek restaurant you had a really bad experience in!)

				Is it Stamatis on 23rd? I almost threw my dish at one of the waitresses there because of her attitude. <br /><br />At Agnati, I practically picked up my dishes and took them to the kitchen myself when the bus boy flat out refused the waitresses&#039; repeated requests to clean off our table. <br /><br />Watawa waiters have more than once spilled drinks on me that they&#039;ve replaced of course, but that I still had to pay for in the end. <br /><br />Mojave too, service sometimes sucks, but the food is always pretty good - I wouldn&#039;t stop going.<br /><br />As for the Building Department complaints, because of the development going on everywhere, Astorians have gotten the 311 itch. <br />The were 6 complaints when the building I live in was under construction, including that it was literally according to the caller &quot;about to collapse&quot;. The reality (which is what the inspector found and documented), a door was being replaced. <br /><br />

				I think it is impossible to find a restaurant that everyone will love.&nbsp; It is not unusual to find that there are people that have had a bad experience at a place whether it be because of the food or service.&nbsp; It&#039;s hard for me to believe that there are people out there that think the food at Lincontro, for example, is not that good but I&#039;m sure these people exist.&nbsp; Some people have clearly had great experiences at Mojave and some people have not.&nbsp; I personally have not.&nbsp; I have been there on two occassions and was not impressed with the food or the service.&nbsp; Maybe I just happen to hit two bad days at Mojave.&nbsp; Maybe I just don&#039;t like their food.&nbsp; Maybe I think there is much better Mexican elsewhere in Astoria.&nbsp; At the end of the day, hopefully people will simply make up their own minds about the place.&nbsp; I think all reviews, good, bad and ugly, should be appreciated, so long as they provide constructive criticism.

				My husband and I finally tried Mojave on Saturday night. We&#039;ve been out of town most of the summer (getting hitched, woo!) so didn&#039;t get around to it as soon as we would have otherwise. We both enjoyed the salsa that came with the chips, but agree that larger portions would have been preferable. We got the buffalo fried oysters as our appetizer. Fabulous. I&#039;ve never had that particular combination before, but I loved it. The combination of the heat and spice from the buffalo spice with the salty of the oyster was just right for me. Unfortunately, some of the oysters were too small and completely overwhelmed by the breading and buffalo sauce. You really got the full impact on the larger oysters where you could taste all the flavors interacting. Overall, though, my favorite menu item at Mojave thus far.<br /><br />I got the crab quesadilla for dinner. I thought the crab was cooked very well, but there wasn&#039;t a lot in the quesadilla. To be fair, I couldn&#039;t even finish my quesadilla because I got so full, but again like the oysters, I want to taste the crab and cheese in every bite and not just tortilla. Unfortunately for myself, I forgot to ask for no spinach because I can&#039;t stand it cooked (love it raw), but it was relatively sparse and easy to remove, so it wasn&#039;t much of an issue. My husband got the enchilada chicken breast and liked it, though he said he preferred my quesadilla to his dish. I can&#039;t really comment because I don&#039;t like molé sauces, but I had a piece of the chicken without the sauce, and again thought it was cooked perfectly. Didn&#039;t do dessert because we both got so full beforehand, but plan on checking them out another time.<br /><br />I am really intrigued by the habañero infused tequila. Has anyone on the board tried it? How about met the 5 in 25 challenge? I couldn&#039;t do 5 in 25 with regular tequila, much less that stuff, so I&#039;m amazed to see that some people actually have their bottles up! A bottle of it was sitting on the ledge over my head the whole time I was there, and I couldn&#039;t stop checking out the pulp at the bottom of the bottle. They don&#039;t just infuse it, they blend the peppers right in!<br /><br />Our server was very attentive in the beginning, but got swamped by a large table later on. Was still very nice, though, and was obviously working so we had no problems with it. He was completely professional the entire time. Only quibble with service was that I ran out of water a couple times and had to wait quite awhile to get refills. That could just be because I&#039;m a fish compared to most people so they don&#039;t anticipate I&#039;ll run out of water that fast, though.<br /><br />Overall, really liked the ambiance. It&#039;s a cool space and they&#039;ve obviously worked hard on the decor and vibe they offer. I thought the service and food both met expectations and exceeded in some areas. I would definitely go back again.

				I ate at Mojave last week with the fiancee and another couple. I had a great meal, chicken fried steak, and enjoyed my fiancee&#039;s angus fajitas (she is a slow eater lol). Desserts were great too. They drank the sangria which they liked and I drank wine by the glass. The 2nd glass I had didn&#039;t taste right and the manager came to the table and tried a glass for himself. He agreed that it was corked and bought me the next glass opening the bottle in front of me. Nice atmosphere and awesome backyard for happy hour. I will definitely go back. Nice touch to Astoria.

				So, I&#039;ve posted here before about how much I love Mojave. However, my husband and I just went there with another couple for my birthday dinner and I have to say, we were sorely disappointed. It&#039;s been awhile since we went to Mojave, so perhaps these changes were implemented a while ago, but we just discovered them.<br /><br />In the past, I&#039;ve praised both the service and the food at Mojave. But, this time, both fell severely flat.<br /><br />Food: Both guys LOVED the chicken fried steak, which is no longer on the menu. My serrano ham quesadilla was not nearly as good as it was last time I had it (probably 6 months ago). Everyone agreed that the guacamole was subpar, but this could be because it&#039;s winter and maybe avocados aren&#039;t in season?<br /><br />Service: We sat down and were not acknowledged for nearly 5 minutes. After our waitress introduced herself, it took another 5 minutes (and us asking) to get water. We ran out of water twice during the meal and had to ask for more. I&#039;m one of those people who drinks a lot of water and really appreciates having it refilled whenever necessary. Our waitress was clearly new, because she wasn&#039;t sure what the &quot;traditional sides&quot; were that came with the fajitas. While she wasn&#039;t rude, she wasn&#039;t particularly nice or helpful either. It took longer than average to receive both our drinks and the food, despite the fact that the dining room wasn&#039;t crowded.<br /><br />Also, when it came to dessert, I wanted to order the molten chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream (instead of the banana praline). My friend wanted just a scoop of vanilla ice cream. However, scoops of ice cream are no longer on the menu and our waitress didn&#039;t think we could order that, which just seems silly because obviously they have ice cream if it comes with dishes. She also didn&#039;t want to let me substitute the ice cream with my cake (which I&#039;ve done in the past with no problem at all).<br /><br />Honestly, we&#039;re not that interested in going back to Mojave, since one of our favorite items is no longer on the menu and the service was so abysmal. I am so disappointed. Maybe we&#039;ll wait a couple months and try again. I&#039;m hoping we just had an off night.

				The service at night has always been hit or miss.&nbsp; On the flip side though, the two gentlemen who work the day shift on the weekend are both really amazing, attentive and go out of the way to make it a pleasant experience.&nbsp; We have more or less made it a habit to go when they are working as we know what to expect.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just a side note - did you ask if they could still make the chicken fried steak?&nbsp; The reason I ask is because when we went this past weekend it was during brunch and my better half wanted calamari (which wasn&#039;t offered on the brunch menu).&nbsp; He asked the waiter if it was possible to get an order and the kitchen was more than happy to comply.&nbsp; <br /><br />Hope that your future experiences there are better and that tonight was just an &quot;off&quot; night.

				Good tip, CJ. We&#039;ve only been to brunch once, and now that you mention it our waiter was particularly good that day. Thanks!<br /><br />And no, we didn&#039;t ask if they could make the chicken fried steak -- probably should have. (although given our experience with asking about substituting ice cream, I&#039;m not hopeful, at least not with the waitress we had!)

				A friend of mine and I had dinner at Mojave the other night, and while the food was really good, the service was not.&nbsp; We had to request water from the busboy, as our waiter forgot about our section by the window.&nbsp; We had to ask twice or three times for water, coffee, even the check!&nbsp; It really detracted from the experience.&nbsp; Fortunately the entrees were really good.&nbsp; I shudder to think about how bad the service would have been had the restaurant been full!&nbsp; I think I will eat at the bar next time I go.&nbsp; At least you always have someone to handle your request if you need them.

				I had a pretty bad experience at Mojave on Halloween. They weren&#039;t that busy at around 9:30 on Halloween, I went there with 3 other people. We all ordered our food, the waitress forgot our appetizer and then insisted I didn&#039;t order it. I distinctly said &quot;guacamole for the table&quot;, everyone else heard me and she made a note on her pad when I said it. Then she brings it as a side later. Then, she forgot my friend&#039;s entree. She pretty obviously lied that it burned and another would be right out. My friend said he didn&#039;t want it now and not to bring it. She said she&#039;d take it off the check (well of course she should). So she brings the entree after we&#039;re all mostly done with our food. My friend again tells her he doesn&#039;t want it, nicely. She insists not once or twice, but at least 7 or 8 times that he take the plate. We&#039;ve all worked at restaurants before and we all know this is so she won&#039;t have to tell her manager that anything went wrong if we take the plate. If it goes back to the kitchen she&#039;s busted. So after everyone at the table says in unison &quot;he doesn&#039;t want it&quot; she finally goes away. She hid for the rest of the night. Now, I understand people make mistakes but own up to it. Also, if they would have comped us a round of drinks or offered us a dessert on the house it would have made up for a lot. We wound up leaving pissed off and vowing not to return.

				not sure if this is worth a new post but I went there last night and it was great. But the place was empty and a few neighbors of mine had never heard of the place. My only issue was that the service wasn&#039;t the best but i got the feeling that they weren&#039;t used to having a large group of people at one time. Anyone else have any issues with this place it is one 31st street, right off the train. <br /><br />Topic merged by moderator - AJTNYC

				My wife and I went (again) last night and sat in the &quot;garden&quot; in their backyard. What was especially interesting about it was that there&#039;s pretty much no way to know you&#039;re still in Astoria -- something about the whole atmosphere seemed very European to us. We almost felt like we were on vacation!

				Yeah that back garden is really nice.&nbsp; You would never even know it&#039;s there.&nbsp; &nbsp;The decor is so nice that you feel like you&#039;re in a park somewhere with all those surrounding trees.&nbsp; The fountain and color choices are really great too.

				I must say I was highly disappointed with my recent trip to Mojave. After hearing and reading in here mixed reviews, I decided to try it for myself as I love Mexican cuisine. <br />Upon being seated we waited a good 10 minutes before being greeted by a server, which happens, I can overlook that. What I can&#039;t overlook are the dirty glasses and dirty table, extremely long wait for food, drinks came right before the meal&nbsp; and the bill i had to get up and go to the bar, confused servers and mediocre food at best. The server kept blaming things on how &quot;busy&quot; the restaurant was, and about the new managment, which is always unprofessional. For one, we made reservations at 7:45 for 6 people and the restaurant was not busy at all, yes there was a game on tv , but isn&#039;t the staff suppost to serve the customers and &quot;not watch the game&quot;?? Moving on, once I received the margarita I ordered, I was pleasantly surprised, however not enough to enjoy my overall experience. The margaritas and location are the saving graces of this establishment. Overall, I was disappointed and will not be back.<br /><br />P.S. Maybe &quot;the manager&quot; should spend more time fixing the glitches of his restaurant and less time flirting with the waitress.

				&nbsp;:-(<br /><br />I used to be a regular here and I always have been a great support for Mojave, but the past few times I do not understand what happened to this place. The food, not great as it used to. The drinks, okay. The service, well, let&#039;s say someone needs to teach the new staff the basics of customer service!.<br /><br />Management??? I spoke with the manager about what i felt&nbsp; since i have been a supporter and left with the impression that he also could care less. I am sorry, i thought they were improving and putting efforts in managing this place since last year. Potential is great here, just the space itself, but they really, really, need to improve management in here...<br /><br />&nbsp;

				I go here almost once a week (mainly for brunch) and think the new managers (new in the past couple of months) are actually pretty good.&nbsp; They seem to always be talking to tables and making sure everyone is happy.&nbsp; When we arrive the staff greets us politely and the service is always consistent as well as the food.&nbsp; <br /><br />*tosses two pennies into the bucket*

				i go here pretty often, but i do think it&#039;s a bit overpriced and the service is veryyyyyy slow. But that doesn&#039;t bother me so much. I go to relax, have a drink and chill. I think management cares about trying to make people happy, but they are probably not professional/educated enough to understand how to manage a place (like someone was mentioning about flirting w/ the waitress)

				I&#039;ve actually been meaning to post about this place. I&#039;ve gone a handful of times, even went last year for their New Years Eve party. And I&#039;ve always been extremely underwhelmed. Last time I left there, I even turned to my boyfriend and said, &quot;I really don&#039;t know why we keep coming back here.&quot; In fact, my food has never been hot (lukewarm, at best), nor has it ever tasted fresh. Yes, I could&#039;ve sent it back, but, as a number of these posts have pointed out, it&#039;s hard to get the attention of the wait staff and they never came back to check on me. <br /><br />Another minor point- I really dislike how their guacamole is served. I hate that I have to try and mix it all up myself. And even at that, it&#039;s totally not seasoned at all (at least not up to my standard...and everyone I know says I make amazing guacamole). I feel the food should be much better for the prices they charge. If I do back, it will be for the drinks, which I think are yummmyy!
