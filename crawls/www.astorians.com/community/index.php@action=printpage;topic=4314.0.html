				So NYC passes the trans fat ban: http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16051436/ (http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16051436/) <br />Will there be any restaurants left?<br />Is this going overboard?&nbsp; Should we as consumers have a right to decide or is the general populace that much in need of big brother to watch over them?<br /><br />Think of the fries!

				Why would anyone choose transfats? Unless you prefer having your arteries clogged. <br />I would love to be able to eat out anywhere without worrying about what I&#39;m eating. This is not the case now.<br /><br />Fries cooked in non-trans fats taste just as good- taste is not an argument. There are bans on transfats in other countries (Denmark, at least) and that is working just fine. I really hope this passes, as it will only help <em>all </em>of us.<br /><br />Another argument is the future price of healthcare. Call me selfish, but I don&#39;t want healthcare to keep rising in order to care for the obese and unhealthy as we get older.<br /><br />This is a personal issue for me, as my mom had to have stents put in her legs recently because of blockage caused by... transfats! <br /><br />

Like butter, lard or tallow, or tropical oils like coconut or palm oil. Butter&#39;s expensive and hard to work with (for some things). Vegetarians can&#39;t eat animal fats. Tropical oils are rather expensive, and I know there&#39;s some issues where palm oil is sometimes grown in plantations where first-growth rain forest used to be. For frying, sure, trans fats are easily replaceable, but for baking? What else could you use in biscuits that would let you sell the results to both Jews and Hindus? <br /><br />And just in general, I&#39;m with the others here who see this as government over-reaching when it should be educating..<br />

				I found the Wikipedia entry on trans fats to be rather interesting:<br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_fat<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">New York City has embarked on a campaign to reduce consumption of trans fats, noting that heart disease is the primary cause of resident deaths. This has included a public education campaign (see trans fat pamphlet) and a request to restaurant owners to voluntarily eliminate trans fat from their offerings. Finding that the voluntary program was not successful, New York City&#39;s Board of Health has solicited public comments on a proposal to ban artificial trans fats in restaurants. The board voted to ban trans fat in restaurant food on December 5th, 2006. New York is the first large US city to strictly limit trans fats in restaurants. Restaurants will be barred from using most frying oils containing artificial trans fats by July 1, and will have to eliminate the artificial trans fats from all of its foods by July 1, 2008.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				So it looks like health wise there isn&#39;t one single redeeming quality to trans-fat.&nbsp; All it&#39;s got going for it is it can be quicker to cook w/, kosher and cheaper.&nbsp; Yet, for the life of me I can&#39;t accept a ban.&nbsp; Tax the hell out of it, make its use required to be published, educate the public.&nbsp; It can be part of a healthy lifestyle.&nbsp; Everything in moderation, except for moderation.&nbsp; <br />I&#39;m not sticking up for businesses here who thrive off of it, forget them.&nbsp; I&#39;m just more cynical about government.<br /><br />MmmmmMmmmmmm lard.

				I can&#39;t help wondering if everyone would feel the same way about a ban on high fructose corn syrup, the horrors of which were discussed on this board.<br /><br />Personally, I don&#39;t eat fast food very often, mostly because I know it&#39;s not good for me.&nbsp; I don&#39;t see anything good to say about trans fat, and if it was an ingredient in medicine that was found to be harmful, I think everyone would want to see that ingredient in the medicine banned.&nbsp; Bad analogy maybe....&nbsp; But certain pesticides have been banned because they&#39;re harmful too....&nbsp; But just like I appreciate not having to breathe cigarette smoke while I&#39;m eating, I will appreciate knowing that the food I eat at restaurants will be somewhat healthier now.&nbsp; I can see why you wouldn&#39;t want a ban and government interference, but there&#39;s not much good to say about trans fat.&nbsp; It kills.

				I&#39;ll preface this by saying that I&#39;m wary about this ban.&nbsp; From the wikipedia entry, it appears that restaurants etc were given the opportunity to refrain from using them voluntarily after being advised that transfats were affecting their customers adversely.&nbsp; They did not comply, so I guess the next step in the minds of some was to take a more agressive stance (banning the trans fats).&nbsp; I&#39;ve seen the trans fat pamphlet that was distributed to restaurants and it&#39;s pretty straight forward with its information.&nbsp; However, who knows if it was even read by those who received it.&nbsp; Anyway, I really wish restaurants had voluntarily chosen (presumably after being educated) to eliminate trans fats.&nbsp; That&#39;s what would have happened in an ideal world...<br /><br />Also, daisy&#39;s question about HFCS is a good one.

				The reason why HFCS is so ubiquitous is because (a) American corn growers are subsidized so there&#39;s too much corn on the market, making the cost of making HFCS extremely low, and (b) American sugar growers are protected by tarriffs so there&#39;s less sugar on the market than there would otherwise be, making sugar in the US something like twice as expensive as in most of the rest of the world. Fix these two annoying policies, and you&#39;d see a lot more sugar in soft drinks and a lot less HFCS in processed foods. <br /><br />I&#39;d much rather see that done than any sort of ban on HFCS. It&#39;s bad for you, yes, but mostly because it&#39;s cheap...

				I support the ban. <br /><br />I notice that no one said a word about JTrane&#39;s analogy to lead paint.&nbsp; I&#39;m sure feelings were strong when THAT was banned.&nbsp; Sure - we don&#39;t eat it (so maybe feelings weren&#39;t SO strong) but people were probably ranting.... &quot;damn - my trim will never look so good without my lead based paint.&quot;<br /><br />What about asbestos??

				Well, after reading all about trans-fat and hearing the arguments of its likeness to poison I&#39;ve been swayed to believe that the ban is a valiant attempt to protect the health of the people and marginally justifiable.&nbsp; But, even still, I&#39;m doubtful that in the long run it will have any benefits.&nbsp; If this is a means to protect those inaccessible to a healthier lifestyle then unfortunately a super-sized big mac with fries hold the trans-fat is still a super-sized big mac with fries.&nbsp; <br />The chemistry of fast food also hasn&#39;t had its last word yet.&nbsp; How long before The Colonel finds something cheaper and nastier to deep fry in?&nbsp; Where there&#39;s a will and money to be made, there&#39;s a way.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think Harlan hit it on the head too; the government subsidies http://www.ewg.org/farm/region.php?fips=00000 (http://www.ewg.org/farm/region.php?fips=00000) are a bigger enemy here.&nbsp; I don&#39;t know what kind of effect would be had on inflation were they to be immediately lifted, but if there were some redistribution to produce that would help more than any trans-fat ban.&nbsp; That however might be a little out of reach for our city council.

				And to top it off, I see in the news that the Bush administration wants the EPA to get rid of the clean air act limits on lead air pollutants.&nbsp; It seems the lobbyist groups for smelters, oil and gas companies have been protesting about the high costs of doing business and this would help them. Their angle is that since the law came into effect during the Carter administration lead air pollution is down over 90% and therefore the law isnt needed any longer. According to them the air is now clean enough to support some lead pollutants again.&nbsp;

				I support the ban. The way I see it, some people would sell you lead lightly fried in puff pastry if you would eat it. They don&#39;t give a damn what the result is, just that you buy. Somebody or something has to curb this behavior, and in this case it&#39;s a law. <br /><br />Sure, those of us who are well-educated and have internet access can do research and find out that they are dangerous and make an educated choice about whether or not we eat the arsenic pastry, but as Jennifer says, we are not the ones who need protection. What does choice mean for those who don&#39;t have the education or resources to inform themselves well?&nbsp; Or who, even if they do have the information, don&#39;t have access to better choices?<br /><br />We are, or should be, judged according to how we treat the least powerful among us.

				I suspect the banning of trans fats will become a trend, much like banning smoking in public places.&nbsp; It is somewhat intrusive by government, but I think it will have positive health impacts.&nbsp; I still think people should be able to use trans fats or smoke if they want to, but government should be working to protect people&#39;s health.

				The Board made three decisions that day, two good and one less so.&nbsp; They allowed off-leash regulations for dogs in parks during late night and early am times (which is good) and made progress on transgender equality allowing people of transgender experience who have had sex reassignment surgery can change their sex on their birth certificates and other documents.&nbsp; They did, however, not go all the way to allow people who are still transitioning or who have GID (gender identity disorder) to be able to change their documentation to reflect their gender without surgery.<br /><br />I think Megc&#39;s right - education is needed about transfats.&nbsp; People might not want to eat them if they knew their impact.

				Education is great, but it doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that once you are educated to want healthier food that it will be within your range of choices (geographically, financially, etc.) <br /><br />My perception is that for people who are poor and less concerned about their diets because they have a long list of other, more immediate, things to stress out about, it&#39;s very difficult to absorb nutritional education and then to make and enforce (within a household) the necessary changes.

				I think education is important, but enigmacat is correct, even when people know that something is bad for them, they may buy it if it is cheap and available.&nbsp; That&#39;s where the bans on transfats come in - remove the widespread ability to obtain food with transfats.&nbsp; I think restaurants and food manufacturers are going to do everything they can to keep the prices and tastes as close to what they already are as possible, so hopefully the regulations and bans result in everyone eating healthier.

				Does anyone really believe that regulating such minor things as trans-fats will really combat arterial clogging and obesity in NYC? &nbsp;I for one don&#39;t. &nbsp;If you actually ingest this crap in the quantities it would take to cause serious harm - you&#39;ve got more problems that switching from trans-fats to saturated fats is not necessarily going to help. &nbsp;Now if you started getting people to reduce their overall fat and calorie consumption - that&#39;s progress.

				Where I&#39;m from, many of my relatives would never know what a trans fat is, and honestly, they are too busy just trying to make it, with kids, gas prices, housing payments and everything else, to really understand or even have time to understand how unhealthy it all is. &nbsp;I wish this ban was in effect up there as well. &nbsp;Anything to help them be healthier. &nbsp;Along with education, but to be honest, I&#39;m not sure they&#39;d have the time to listen. &nbsp;And I imagine that most of suburban America is like this.<br /><br />I&#39;m not positive on this, but I think Bill Clinton was involved in a government initiative to get soft drinks and junk food (?) out of schools.&nbsp; Or was that nyc?&nbsp; It was on the news somewhere.&nbsp; Don&#39;t have time to look this up, perhaps someone else does.

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Theme Parks Now Offering You Trans-Fat Free Food<br />Article Date: 28 Dec 2006 - 6:00 PST<br />http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/healthnews.php?newsid=59851<br /><br />Following in the footsteps of the public initiative in New York restaurants, Universal Studios has announced it is introducing healthier side dishes and aims to eliminate artificial trans-fats from its menus. This began on Christmas Eve with certain adult and children&#39;s meals in many of the theme parks. Fries not cooked in artificial trans-fats will be on offer in some of the parks in Orlando and Hollywood, as will side salads and fruit and a range of healthier beverages. The aim is for all theme parks to be 100 per cent free of artificial trans-fats by the end of 2007.<br /><br />In making this announcement Universal Studio&#39;s executive chef of Parks and Resorts, Steven Jayson, said that they while they want their guests to feel good about their food, they also want them to retain the element of choice, &quot;that is why our program is about choices rather than absolutes&quot;. Universal Studios have been researching healthy alternatives and eliciting customer feedback and Jayson adds that &quot;We did not want to sacrifice taste or quality. It’s important for our guests to know that healthy food can taste good.&quot;<br /><br />Artificial trans-fats are made from vegetable oils that are hydrogenated to make them easier to use in processed foods such as pastry and confectionery, and to keep it semi-solid like butter for frying and spreading and to extend its shelf-life because it takes longer to go rancid. While this makes it more convenient for food producers, research has shown that a diet high in trans-fats contributes to obesity and heart disease.<br /><br />Natural trans-fats do exist but they form a very small proportion of the natural fat we eat, so the term &quot;artificial trans-fat&quot; has become shortened to &quot;trans-fat&quot;.<br /><br />Trans-fats are not saturated fats (their chemical structure includes double carbon-carbon bonds, whereas saturated fats have only single carbon-carbon bonds), they are in fact partly saturated, retaining the same ratio of hydrogen to carbon atoms as naturally occuring poly-unsaturated fats. It is thought the problem lies in the structure of the trans-fat molecule. <br /><br />The term &quot;trans&quot; comes from the shape of the fat molecule that is produced when the vegetable oil is hydrogenated. Hydrogenation simply means the double and triple bonds between some of the carbon atoms in the poly- or mono-unsaturated vegetable oils are broken to cause hydrogen atoms to become attached to them instead. <br /><br />The problem with trans-fats seems to lie in the fact that when hydrogen atoms are added to the carbon-carbon bonds, they form a transverse pattern, lying on alternating opposite sides of the carbon-carbon link. This is different to the &quot;cis&quot; configuration, more common in naturally occuring fatty acids, where the hydrogen atoms lie next to each other on the same side of the carbon-carbon link. <br /><br />It is possible that it is this &quot;trans&quot; spatial configuration that interferes with the fat&#39;s properties, for example when it interacts with cholesterol. Although chemically different to saturated fats, trans-fats act like them by raising the level of bad cholesterol (LDL). However, unlike saturated fat they have another undesirable effect - trans-fats also lower the level of good cholesterol (HDL). <br /><br />So in a way, trans-fats are even more harmful than saturated fats as a prime source of fatty acids in our diet. That&#39;s what all the fuss is about.<br /><br />The average person in the US consumes 2.2 kg (nearly 5 pounds) of (artificial) trans-fats in a year.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Here&#39;s a newer version of the Healthy Eating pyramid, too:<br />http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/pyramids.html<br /><br />[attachment deleted by admin]

				Ironic that when people find out I&#39;m a vegetarian they still ask &quot;REALLY?! But what do you eat then?&quot;<br /><br />Uh, I&#39;m eating everything in the lower 95% of the food pyramid. :)<br /><br />Guess that&#39;s slightly off topic, sorry...

				We just returned from New Orleans.&nbsp; They only eat from the top portion of the pyramid. Well that and alcohol.&nbsp; <br /><br />We saw no veggies on a plate except for garnish.&nbsp; All seafood dishes were in butter sauces with chorizo.&nbsp; If you ate raw oysters you had it with beer.<br /><br />The only exercise we saw were people walking from work to lunch and people walking from bar to bar.&nbsp; And cardio consisted of throwing beads at womens chests from about 20 feet away.<br /><br />Those people are going to die fast but boy are they going to die full and happy.<br /><br />Can&#39;t wait to go back.

				Yes, the condiments have to go, especially salt...our diets are too high in sodium...in fact, someone should get into the kitchens and start monitoring how much salt cooks are putting into the food...best bet would be to only allow a quota of salt to each eatery per month in order to keep blood pressure down. But then, people might go elsewhere to get the salt...we better blockade the beaches and the oceans..can&#39;t be too careful..
