				If you have a child or children who scored into G&amp;T (either local or city-wide) in District 30 or District 2, PS 217 on Roosevelt Island is accepting applications for Kindergarten and 1st Grade.<br /><br />Background: The program was prematurely closed to D30 in the spring, but after a meeting with the DOE last Friday, it is now welcoming D30 once again and we hope to fill a K G&amp;T class for the fall!<br /><br />If you are interested in your child attending the program, YOUR ACTION IS NEEDED! You MUST call or e-mail the Parent Coordinator at PS 217, Lauraine (212-980-0294, LRademakerATschools.nyc.gov) IMMEDIATELY, and ask her to put the child&#039;s name down on the list.<br /><br />By expressing your interest in the program you are not giving away any spot you may already have at a different school; you are only opening up another wonderful option to your child and helping to keep the program open.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the PS 217 G&amp;T website: http://rigandt.blogspot.com/<br /><br />There will be FOUR TOURS of the school within the next two weeks, STARTING THIS WEDNESDAY:<br /><br />Wed, June 16 @ 8:45 am<br />Friday, June 18 @ 8:45 am<br /><br />Tuesday, June 22nd @ 8:45 am<br />Thurs, June 24 @ 8:45 am

				Title: <strong>P.S. 217 G&amp;T Update (June 15th)</strong><br />

				The Administration &amp; PTA of PS/IS 217 has decided to go forward with the planned G&amp;T Kindergarten class for the 2010/11 School Year – regardless of DOE’s stated minimum requirements. What does this mean? It means that there WILL BE a Kindergarten G&amp;T class in place, and that you can still put your child’s name on the list to attend – regardless of whether you’ve already registered at another school. <br />IF YOU WANT TO ENROLL YOUR CHILD AT PS/IS 217: <br /><br />1) Immediately contact Parent Coordinator Lauraine Rademaker at lrademaker@schools.nyc.gov (or call 347-563-5165) to express your intent and to fill out a ‘Placement Exception Request Form”, which is a required document in this process.<br /><br />2) Email Kim Cobb (kcobb@schools.nyc.gov), and Michael Greenberg (mgreenberg5@schools.nyc.gov), in the Enrollment Office of the DOE expressing your intention (please cc: Nikki Leopold at nikkipta@gmail.com).<br /><br />Per the DOE’s Elizabeth Rose, Director of Portfolio Planning: “Families will not give up their current seat unless and until we make a decision to open the class at 217.” <br /><br />THEREFORE, FOR YOUR OWN PIECE OF MIND, WE WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO REGISTER TO THE SCHOOL YOU WERE MATCHED WITH (IF APPICABLE), UNTIL REGISTRATION AT PS/IS 217 OPENS.&nbsp; We anticipate this to happen sometime after Friday, June 24th.<br /><br />DON’T DELAY! CONTACT PS/IS 217 &amp; THE DOE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO REGISTER YOUR CHILD’S NAME FOR THE G&amp;T KINDERGARTEN CLASS!!<br /><br />If you have any questions or require any additional information, please contact Nikki Leopold, PS/IS 217 PTA President, at nikkipta@gmail.com<br /><br />Scheduled Tours of 217:<br />===============<br />Wednesday, June 16 @ 8:45 am<br />Friday, June 18 @ 8:45 am<br />Tuesday, June 22nd @ 8:45 am<br />Thursday, June 24 @ 8:45 am
