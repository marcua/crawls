				I watched it when it was documenting the battle for Guadalcanal. So far, Ithought it was exceptionally well done. I liked the fact that the focus is on the experience on the ground, the day-to-day horrors of what happened. AS well as the effect back home.<br /><br />To early to tell, but I think this is going to be another huge success fo rBurns.<br /><br />I probably won&#039;t be able to see all of it, but will definitely look for it when it&#039;s out on DVD.

				All I can say is thank God Ken Burns is taking an exhaustive look at a topic that has been so ignored and so very seldomly covered as WWII.&nbsp; I mean when was the last time you saw a documentary on that chapter in American life?&nbsp; What?&nbsp; It&#039;s History Channel&#039;s bread and butter?&nbsp; Oh.&nbsp; Thanks voices in my head.

				I actually thought Band of Brothers was well done and a good show of what the war was like.&nbsp; The movie was based on the book which was made from letters and actual interviews with Easy Company.&nbsp; I can watch the film (or miniseries..whatever you want to call it) over and over and never tire of it.

				I have to agree, Band of Brothers is / was awesome, and it&#039;s the TV box set that gets the most viewing time in my home, but it&#039;s not to say that the subject matter hasn&#039;t been covered before (even Tom Hanks - who produced BoB had done Saving Private Ryan a few years earlier).&nbsp; <br />By the way, does anyone know anything about the rumors of a Pacific front version of BoB being made?&nbsp; I would love to see that.

				I had read that their was a BoB Pacific theatre in the works as well. Haven&#039;t seen anything in awhile, although below is a wikipedia link. I also have and love the BoB series. As much as I liked Saving Private Ryan, many WWII vets didn&#039;t like it because many of the privates were borderline insubordinate to their superiors in the movie. I read BoB before the series came out and thought it was done perfectly. <br /><br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pacific_%28TV_series%29

				I saw the first episode of the war.&nbsp; It was good, but it didn&#039;t quite stick to me like Ken Burns baseball did.&nbsp; Burns romanitcizes things and when it comes to Jackie Robinson, the Staten Island Scot and the 62&#039; Mets (Yo La Tengo!) that&#039;s fine with me.&nbsp; But WWII is a bit different because its history (though Civil War was history and that was a masterpiece.&nbsp; maybe he lost a step over the years?&nbsp; or maybe its easier to romanticize an event in the pre-media age?).&nbsp; I&#039;ll still watch it of course, but on those cold rainy stay at home autumn saturdays, I&#039;d rather watch Band of Brothers, or the full length version of Das Boot (best WWII movie ever made in my book)<br /><br />Hrmph, do you know where I can read up on the insubordination issue on Private Ryan?&nbsp; That thought ran through my mind a bit while watching it, but I didn&#039;t know if that was considered acceptable wartime behavior.
