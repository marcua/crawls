			I couldn&#039;t find a recent discussion of this topic here, so I thought I should post something about it. While the shelter isn&#039;t in Astoria proper, it is very close by and will certainly affect Astoria. BTW, I&#039;m not looking to debate the issue...just want to share the info.<br /><br />http://astoriapost.com/2014/07/24/residents-want-homeless-shelter-gone-expressed-concerns-about-crime-and-schools/

			I&#039;m baffled. If this place was NOT a homeless shelter, it is then a place for hourly stays for adultery and prostitution. But people have a problem with homeless people having a place to live instead? Seems backwards to me.

			One of the differences may be that the prostitutes weren&#039;t long-term residents sending their kids to already crowded schools. Not that the homeless residents are the same as prostitutes....just following the previous comparison.

			They don&#039;t say Westway is the best way for nuthin&#039;.<br /><br /><br />This is a very, very on-going situation. This motel has been used as a temporary homeless shelter on and off for many years and before that it used to as a temporary shelter for people awaiting deportation.<br /><br /><br />Why it&#039;s become so contentious now is that the city has been opening &#039;permanent&#039; homeless shelters throughout the city without consulting the community or local elected officials. Another shelter was established at the Pan Am hotel on Queens Blvd in Elmhurst, though the city said this would not happen.<br /><br /><br />In 2012 residents were able to stop the shelter from becoming permanent, though it is my understanding that the Westway stilled housed some homeless residents on a temporary overnight basis since. <br /><br /><br />It&#039;s mostly NIMBYism but also, I think the main objection is that the city warehouses homeless families with complex needs and offers little to no support and it&#039;s the local residents who have to deal with any problems that arise. Supposedly the Westway shelter will be run by an organization called Women in Need, so maybe it won&#039;t be the case in this instance.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />
