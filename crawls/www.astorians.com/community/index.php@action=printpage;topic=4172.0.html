				as much as I would do those places, Xahc has a very specific palate and isn&#39;t the adventurous type. <br />what about that Stove place? or Ploes? maybe another greek joint? have done agnanti, taverna, opa, elia&#39;s so not those... hahaha. keep going, rack your brains!<br />

				<strong>Ploes</strong> is good: there are lots of traditional Greek offerings (no surprises with souvlaki) but also lots of more exotic stuff (like tons of mezes and cheese dishes). Not cheap, but not totally pricey. Somewhere in between. Upscale family crowd. highly reccomended!

				Well, I was kidding a little bit about Just Arthur&#39;s. &nbsp;:-) &nbsp;I&#39;ve only been there once, in July 1995, so I really can&#39;t say one way or the other how it is now. &nbsp;I&#39;m pretty sure I had a steak, and I think it was good. &nbsp;I can&#39;t remember anything about the pricing. &nbsp;It might be a little high for what you&#39;re lookiing for.<br /><br />BZ grill sounds like a possibility. &nbsp;What about Michael Angelo II? &nbsp;23rd Ave. between 31st and 29th. &nbsp;Really good thin crust pie, good Ceasar salad and calamari (unless they&#39;re slammed, and then quality suffers a little). &nbsp;They&#39;ve got fairly good variety of other things on the menu, and they&#39;re quite reasonable.<br /><br />

				I like Brick (cozy and rustic Italian) and Koliba (Czech food) and Fatty&#39;s (oh Fatty&#39;s is so great,great sweet potatoe fries!!!).Central is fancy but has great fish!&nbsp; Sac&#39;s Brick Oven Pizza, nice atmospher, tableclothes etc but not fancy.....best brickoven this side of the Atlantic. Manducati&#39;s (hidden gem in LIC...not for the impatient you can wait 1 and 1/2 hour for your freshly made entree, no joke)....Kycladis (best Greek seafood, casual). Hope this helps.<br /><br />
