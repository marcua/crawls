				Nice snaps Zip, there are a lot of us in the area who take photos and are generally interested in photography. Sorabji (who I haven&#39;t seen a post from in a long, long time ...) does terrific work and has a wonderful site: <br /><br />http://www.sorabji.com/<br /><br />And then there is the Astoria group on flickr where some of us post to as well:<br /><br />http://www.flickr.com/groups/astoria/<br /><br /><br /><br />

				^thanks for the links.<br /><br />You&#39;re right - Sorabji&#39;s got a ton of good stuff up, and also Flickr is probably a better place to post lots of shots than here.&nbsp; I guess I should get an account at some point.

				I&#39;m also pretty fond of Zooomr, which is like Flickr but has a couple of extra features (and some annoying bugs, but hopefully they&#39;ll squash &#39;em soon). One feature is geo-tagging, where you can put your photos on a Google map and then find other photos near them. And it&#39;s a little more Web 2.0 in interface than Flickr too. <br /><br />Here are my photos that I&#39;ve put up there: http://beta.zooomr.com/photos/harlan (http://beta.zooomr.com/photos/harlan)

				Speaking of photography, any suggestions on where to get good-quality but inexpensive photo frames? The local places in Astoria seem to charge about $60 for frame/matting/etc for an 8x10 photo.

They&#39;re not expensive, they have standard size frames and mats, but, the best part is you can create your own, any size frame or mat, multiple image mats, and get them in any color, shape, position, etc. Plus, you can design it all online with a preview. Used them to get the frames and mats for my comic book art pages (couldn&#39;t use standard sizes for them - they&#39;re 17 x 21 and mat, frame, glass, and backing were just under $20 each).<br /><br />http://www.framesbymail.com

				Hey duluoz cats -<br /><br />With frames by mail, what do you do about glass?&nbsp; I see they won&#39;t ship glass (probably a good idea), but they offer plexiglass.&nbsp; Have you tried that?&nbsp; Do you buy glass locally afterward?<br /><br />I&#39;ve been trying to figure this one out for a little while now...<br /><br />Thanks!<br />

Plus, you never know who you&#39;ll run into there.
