				I live on 34th Street and we have always gotten our fair share of street traffic from those who take it instead of 31st Street off the Triboro.&nbsp; I have lived in the same building, facing the same street for almost 6 years and have noticed that this year the horns and street noise is getting ridiculous.<br /><br />People honk at garbage and recycling trucks in the morning - so if you manage to sleep through the noise of the pick ups you get woken up by the honking. People don&#039;t really think their honking will make the garbage truck move do they? And what about the person who use to honk at 6:15am for their pickup...get a clue and call the person you are picking up or ring the buzzer for them! I guess that might wake up other people in the apartment, which would be really inconsiderate - let&#039;s just wake up the entire neighborhood instead!&nbsp; I know there will always be noise in NY - but do we really need horns waking us up every morning??<br /><br />I know there are areas in Manhattan where they have the signs posted regarding the fines for unnecessary honking. What would it take to get these signs in Astoria as reminders of the potential fines and more importantly to have noise ordinances enforced in Astoria?

				I don&#039;t have an answer for you, but I live on Steinway (above Ditmars, so you&#039;d think quieter, right?) near a traffic light, and the constant double parking and subsequent beeping/trucks going to the BQE that do (what I call) the truck fart thing (if you knew what I was talking about you&#039;d think it sounded like a truck fart too)/busses that honk at people parked in the bus stops/taxis honking at people in the bus stop/etc etc etc drives me mad too.<br /><br />I&#039;ve thought about just sitting on my roof and egging people one random morning, but then I had the genius idea of paint balloons (instead of water balloons). Perhaps you&#039;d like to join me?<br /><br />(Not trying to be a jerk, but I can&#039;t stand it either.)

				RJK, I&#039;m on 34th street too -- I feel your pain. :cry: <br /><br />Also, let&#039;s not forget when the drivers stop honking and decide to get out of their cars to yell at the garbage trucks. I&#039;m sure that&#039;s a big help as well. I also love the guy accros the street from me that liked to use his circular saw (and shop lamps!) at 11:30 on a Sunday night. Who are these people?!?!?<br /><br />I feel worse for my boyfriend who works nights and crawls into bed at that time of day. There&#039;s only so many pillows he can bury his head with. *sigh*<br /><br />Sadly, I have no real suggestions unless you want to get together sometime and build a potato cannon to fire at these people. ;)<br /><br /><br />Oh, and hi everyone! I&#039;ve lurked here for a while and this is my first post. I&#039;m a Queens native who has lived in Astoria for a little over a year... minus my noisy block, this is a great hood. I love this forum too!<br /><br />

				It also seems that the caliber of person driving in Astoria has changed over the past decade - aggressive, cutting you off, and the worst, the tooting of horns at the moment the light turns green. I do not know where this type of person learned to drive, but it must be in a culture that is a bit different than the one that taught me &#039;easy does it&#039; when on the road. The SUV, LTC and pickup trucks seems to be the worst offenders.<br /><br />The other problem is the increasing number of cars - where there used to be one or two cars at a light, you now have five or six. Everyone I know that has lived in Astoria for more than five or ten years notices this. Yes, this is a result of over building and illegal conversions. The infrastructure of our community was never designed for this weight.<br /><br />I do not understand the apparent helplessness the authorities display when is comes to do anything about motorcycles. <br /><br />Hell, I can walk down any avenue or street and hand out a dozen violations. Must be beneath the dignity of the boys in blue to notice such mundane issues.

				I have been on the road for decades and have never seen the kind of short-tempered reckless driving that seems to be the &#039;norm&#039; in the past few years. Driving is no longer the pleasure that it once was. I nor anyone I know have changed their habits, and when I ride with others, I hear the same comments. They did not teach us this in drivers ed in high school. <br /><br />I find it very very hard to believe that this is the sort of driving you find in the midwest, especially urban areas (farmboys behind the wheel is another issue). Indeed, when I drive out there the people are so laid back they seem to be asleep on the road.<br /><br />But even ignoring this, the number of cars on the road is skyrocketing. Something must be done to put a limit to this or the noise will just get worse and worse.&nbsp;

Ever since I lived in the city, which was in 1990, NYC drivers were aggressive; that their reputation, I thought.&nbsp; I might be repeating myself here, but I found that LIC/Astoria was not as bad, but it was still a lot more aggressive than the midwest.&nbsp; This is why I choose not to drive.

				&quot;In fact, if you ever heard a horn honking, you knew it had to be an emergency&quot;<br /><br />Absolutely - the horn meant there was something wrong - not just a minor inconvenience of being delayed for 2 seconds.<br /><br />I was just in Guadalajara Mexico for five days and I think the entire time I heard 2 horns - it was so wonderful!!!<br /><br />So every one agrees that the horns are out of control - what can we do about it?
