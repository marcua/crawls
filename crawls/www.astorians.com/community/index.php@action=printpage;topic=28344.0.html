				Is Yogurt La Crepe open yet?

				OK - so maybe I&#039;ve succumbed to the whole gourmet pizza trend in Astoria, but we went to eat at Razzie&#039;s last night only to find a sad looking place with high top tables jammed into a small space, and an overall unappealing look.&nbsp; The pizza may be very good but I think we&#039;d only go here for take out or delivery.&nbsp; I guess I expected it to be larger and more like a restaurant.&nbsp; I&#039;m really looking forward to trying PS on Broadway.&nbsp; That place looks great.&nbsp; I really enjoy these pizza/pub combo places.&nbsp; I think Tuffino on Ditmars has very good pizza but they could work on the atmosphere and jazz it up a bit.

				Me too with being on the shorter side - and their stools looked really tall even for high tops.&nbsp; But worse, it was a lot of furniture crammed into a very tight space.&nbsp; Really claustrophobic to me.&nbsp; We live close enough to try delivery when they offer it.&nbsp; Like you say, maybe with outdoor seating, we&#039;d stay there and eat.&nbsp; I noticed the crepe place next door got their A rating back too.

				They need a better interior decorator.&nbsp; If they got regular tables and not high tops it would have been bettter.&nbsp; But the important thing is that the pizza is good. I also saw a menu and they have a very big selection of different kinds of dishes.

				Having not tried their pizza yet, trying to stay open minded, but their take-out menu is not encouraging. It has about 400 items listed as available, which tells me that this is a good place to go if you want food taken out of a freezer and prepared with less-than-fresh ingredients...

				I have come to the conclusion that Razzie&#039;s doesn&#039;t know how to run their business.&nbsp; On Saturday around 12noon I thought I would have a slice at Razzie&#039;s so I got there and there was a lady with 4 kids about to enter and the guy behind the counter waved his hands that they were closed.&nbsp; He lost 6 customers and I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll be going back for a while.&nbsp; This makes no sense to me to close at lunchtime

				I saw that Razzie&#039;s now has smaller tables that seat 1 or 2 people the most, but they are still the high top tables.&nbsp; Do they really think this is going to help their business?

				From the looks of it Razzies has gone belly up.&nbsp; Place was dark, chairs up on tables, open/closed sign removed from door.<br /><br /><br />I think one lesson to be learned here is that if you are starting a new business, you need to be on site working at it full time, especially when it first opens up.&nbsp; You cannot just have one person there, making the pizzas, running the register, etc.&nbsp; You need to have soda in the cooler, water available.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Let me just say I would never wish that a business go under...especially since I didn&#039;t feel that the people were bad or anything.&nbsp; That said, it was wrong from the start.&nbsp; They took forever to open the place and once it did open, it wasn&#039;t great pizza.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t terrible though.&nbsp; But worse, they never had any buzz around the place and they never did anything to lure people in.&nbsp; They should have run specials.&nbsp; They should have flyered and advertised.&nbsp; Can you imagine if they did an after school special?&nbsp; Those kids from St. John&#039;s would have been over there in droves.&nbsp; They just didn&#039;t do enough to garner any real attention.<br /><br /><br />A new pizza/souvlaki place?&nbsp; Really?&nbsp; Why not just go across the street to Pizza Palace?&nbsp;

				Walked by today on my way to the subway, and there is a sign posted in the door, that the place is under threat of seizure by the landlord for failing to pay rent for March, April, May.&nbsp; <br />So any plans for this place to be sold to a new owner are probably on hold until the landlord gets his 12 grand.<br /><br /><br /><br />
