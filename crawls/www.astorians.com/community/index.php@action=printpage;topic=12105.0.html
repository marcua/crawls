			<dd class="postbody">
				I don&#039;t know about other dog-owners out there, but I&#039;m not very impressed with the size or location of the current dog park in (barely) Astoria Park. There are many areas around the park proper, specifically right under the bridge on the south side of the pool, that would be ideal for larger dog parks if fenced off.<br /><br />I&#039;m currently looking into the feasibility/funding possibilities for this. While the Department of Parks and Recreation has a large say in what goes on in city parks, dog runs are generally results of community groups and community care. With the right fencing, landscaping, and a few benches, I don&#039;t think it would take too much time or money to make a nicer, more practical, more appealing dog park for Astoria residents and their dogs. <br /><br />If anyone&#039;s interested, has any ideas, any connections, or wants to help out, please join this group! Before I start bugging city and park officials, I want to make sure I have enough community support.<br /><br />Thanks!

				If Astoria Park gets a sanctioned Dog Run, the Department of Parks will no longer allow off-leash hours for dogs in Astoria Park. I believe the Community has already made this decision. It is very expensive to get a clean well-run Dog Run up and operating for all sized dogs. Off-leash hours can be enjoyed by all well-behaved dogs and their well-behaved owners from the hours of 9:00 PM to 9:00 AM.

				I&#039;m not impressed with the dog runs in Astoria either, in fact, there are no dog runs to speak of.&nbsp; I&#039;m fully in favor of establishing a great dog run in Astoria that is not located in or around Astoria Park.&nbsp; Sign me up Sooperpaz.

				OK I&#039;m going to start to put together a cleanup crew for the existing dog park - like a new fence, some landscape repair, and some benches. I&#039;ll be setting up a website soon (.org) and possibly file for a DBA under Astoria Dog Park Cleanup Crew. The DBA is expensive, but would be necessary to accept any donations. Does anyone have any information about who actually owns the dog park? I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;s not owned by the city itself, but I can&#039;t seem to find any information online regarding who the land belongs to. Only minor repairs could be made without permission of the actual owners.

				I&#039;m Bill, the owner of the two border collies who play frisbee every so often in the morning at 8:15.<br /><br />I&#039;m the moderator the Yahoo group, and worked to rally people to get the city to legalize off-leash hours.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t been that active in park politics.&nbsp; Martha has done that. If you PM me I can give her your contact info.&nbsp; Martha knows everything about the park and the dog run.&nbsp; The dog run is along the river at the deadend of Hoyt.&nbsp; The dog run is privately owned by a guy named Tex.&nbsp; It&#039;s his private property and he allows us to use it, but it&#039;s his.&nbsp;

				Hi Bill.&nbsp; Thanks for your response.&nbsp; Love Border Collies by the way...but I digress...<br /><br />I am very familiar with the enclosed dog run.&nbsp; It&#039;s very run down as was described by Sooperpaz.&nbsp; I am just curious as to whether or not your group would support a clean up/renovation of the enclosed dog run.&nbsp; I was confused by your statement about a preference for the off leash dog run over Tex trying to give the run to the City to be maintained.&nbsp; I think Sooperpaz is encouraging a public effort to improve Tex&#039;s run.&nbsp; Unless I am missing something, I can&#039;t imagine that he would object to something like that.

I have used the same vet for the past 35+ years and he hands all new clients a severe warning about the use of most dog runs. There are so many diseases spread in these places by careless and negligent pet owners who don&#039;t get their dogs vaccinated; who encourage their dog&#039;s aggressiveness; who find it cute that their dogs (male and female) will hump anything that is vertical (please remember that humping is not sexual with dogs—it is a very aggressive, and manipulative power move); that come with intact males or females in heat; that spread intestinal worms through their feces that owners don&#039;t clean up . . . dog runs are confined spaces that need to be clean, safe and healthy places for both dogs and dog owners. The only times I have seen this in New York City are the few that have a full time attendant or full time volunteers to help maintain both a clean and safe environment. <br /><br />Dogs need to run freely to use up all their energy and, along with a proper diet, it also helps keep them in condition; as a result they tend to live longer and healthier lives and are happier pets. <span class="bbc_u"><em>In my personal experience</em></span>, people who will only take their dogs to a dog run are dog owners who have not succeeded at training a well-behaved dog. A well-trained dog is a well-behaved dog; a well-behaved dog can be allowed off-leash in a public space because they will follow their owners&#039; commands to sit, stay come, etc. A well-behaved dog is not aggressive. A well-behaved dog is non-reactive. A well-behaved dog is a pleasure to be around. The only way to achieve having a well-behaved dog is through a healthy diet, reinforced obedience training, daily breed- and personality-specific exercise, consistent discipline, and lots and lots of affection.

And despite the common image of animal protection agencies as cash-strapped organizations dedicated to animal welfare, HSUS has become the wealthiest animal rights organization on earth.<br /><br />HSUS is big, rich, and powerful, a “humane society” in name only. And while most local animal shelters are under-funded and unsung, HSUS has accumulated $113 million in assets and built a recognizable brand by capitalizing on the confusion its very name provokes. This misdirection results in an irony of which most animal lovers are unaware: HSUS raises enough money to finance animal shelters in every single state, with money to spare, yet it doesn’t operate a single one anywhere.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />To read in its entirety please see: http://www.activistcash.com/organization_overview.cfm (http://www.activistcash.com/organization_overview.cfm)<br /><br />Now for the NSAL (North Shore Animal League) . . . during the evacuation of the government enforced abandonment of all pets, domestic and otherwise, in the aftermath of Katrina, NSAL sent down 2 HUGE trucks and in excess of 1200 crates to collect dogs, cats and rabbits, bring them back to Long Island WITHOUT ANY OF THEM HAVING BEEN PROPERLY IDENTIFIED AND/OR VETTED and then proceeded to sell, errr, hmmm, put them up for adoption. All this while their owners were still frantically searching for them. When a few of the Rescues that I work very closely with were able to PROVE that NSAL had transported beloved pets whose owners were looking for them, NSAL REFUSED to ALLOW the owners to come to NY and claim them. <br /><br />So, for me, quoting any literature of either of these organizations makes the point moot.

Also about Tex i do give him props don&#039;t get me wrong but all we want to do is just help and restore it we aren&#039;t going to take over it, it would still be his and i think if it looked better he would be happier , i know i would. Does anyone know where in the Shore Towers he lives i would really like to talk to him. Has anyone done that already?

The Primary causes in dogs are: ligament, tendon, or muscle disease; fractures involving the joint; developmental disorders; congenital disorders;&nbsp; dietary and hormonal disease; metabolic disorders; cancer; degenerative joint disease; inflammatory joint disease and degenerative spinal joint disease. In fact in many types of Arthritis any form of exercise is contraindicated. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=12105.msg208961.html#msg208961">Quote from: Valentin Mosnegutu on January 23, 2011, 04:04:27 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">and how can you make a nonsocial dog into a social one ?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>There are two separate and equal socializations that a dog must be taught: human and canine.

Your very knowledgeable. As for Tex i found out today he doesn&#039;t live at the Shore Towers he lives right across the street from the dog run. I also talked to a man who said he didn&#039;t like Tex because his dogs(2 boxers he said) started barking at the other owners dogs. Why wouldn&#039;t he take legal action? Its his property. I would also like to ask, what if someone was to sew him for unsafe condition for dogs and dog owners would the land be taken away by the city, or would he have to fix it up to meet the public dog run standards?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

He is just a grumpy old man, but even the crankiest person is still approachable if addressed in an appropriate and respectful manner. What&#039;s the worst possible scenario? He speaks gruffly and dismisses you? Nothing gained, nothing lost. There is an old Yiddish expression: (roughly translated it means) If you don&#039;t ask the question, you will never learn the answer.<br /><br />I am just curious, what kind of dog do you have and how old is it?

				&nbsp;I myself don&#039;t have a dog since i don&#039;t have my own place and my mom loves her cats . the apartment isn&#039;t big enough for a dog not even a small dog. Which sucks because I&#039;ve always wanted a dog. My grandmother has a dog and i visit it often, not as often as i would like because my grandmother is a chatter box ( lol ). i actually have no idea what kinda dog it is but it is defiantly a mix&nbsp; i don&#039;t think she does either.. its a big black dog that&#039;s all i know, sorry. Also i saw a old post of yours that you offred to train dogs for free in astoria park .. do you still do that? I would do every summer if i knew how to. And also your right whats the worst that can happen, what i had in mind was to not approch him at all start doing small things like get a lid for the trash can upgrade the pooper scooper area a bit you know... I wouldnt want to rip the fence out and then get get arrested/sewed for distruction of property .. what do u think ?

I&#039;m not saying he is anything because I haven&#039;t met him yet but i am cautious now that I heard that sure.
