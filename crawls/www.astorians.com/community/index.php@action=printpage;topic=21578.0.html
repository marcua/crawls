				<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: Arial;" class="bbc_font">Dear Greenmarket Community,</span></span> <span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: Arial;" class="bbc_font"> </span></span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: Arial;" class="bbc_font">We will learn about the full extent of the damage caused by Tropical Storm Irene in the days and weeks to come, as the waters begin to recede from upstate farms. The Black Dirt region is still flooded, Sullivan County and Ulster County have seen significant damage, and there are parts of Greene County that no longer exist.&nbsp; We estimate that 80% of Greenmarket farmers have been impacted, with about 10% reporting severe loss—80-100% of their products. This couldn’t have happened at a worse time of year— as you know, September is when our farmers make the money they need to sustain their farm businesses. It is too late in the season to re-plant, and in addition to the great summer harvest that typically arrives in September, these farmers have lost their winter storage crops as well—beets, onions and squash—the products that sustain year-round sales.</span></span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: Arial;" class="bbc_font"> </span></span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: Arial;" class="bbc_font">Markets were open at 5 a.m. the day after the storm, and we are encouraging residents to support regional farmers first and foremost by shopping at Greenmarket. Some of the farmers you have forged strong relationships with over the years may not be back at the markets this season due to the aftermath of the storm, but we will do everything we can to ensure that they return to market in the spring of 2012. In the mean time, we don’t anticipate that our markets will be impacted in terms of the quality or the variety of products you have come to expect. </span></span><span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: Arial;" class="bbc_font">We have set up a donation page on the GrowNYC website, which you can find at </span></span><span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: Arial;" class="bbc_font">www.grownyc.org/blog</span> (http://www.grownyc.org/blog)</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: Arial;" class="bbc_font">. We plan to have a message board up on our website by this weekend, where those seeking assistance (volunteer help, or in-kind donations) and those who are ready to volunteer can be put in touch. If you have any questions, please reach out to our office: 212-788-7476.</span></span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: Arial;" class="bbc_font"> </span></span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: Arial;" class="bbc_font">Greenmarket farmers are a resilient group of individuals, who have weathered many storms prior to this one. Thanks to an incredible community of shoppers and supporters, we’ll help our regional growers get through to a strong recovery.</span></span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: Arial;" class="bbc_font"> </span></span>
