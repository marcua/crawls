				The Beer Garden &quot;officially&quot; opens for the season on April 1st, but I went there with my family today.&nbsp; It appears they now have a hostess and table service.&nbsp; That means table service for the beer, too.&nbsp; It&#039;s very odd.&nbsp; There appeared to be about 6-8 on the waitstaff and a busboy who was a little overeager, trying to take away beer glasses that weren&#039;t quite empty.&nbsp; The waitstaff aren&#039;t even chek.&nbsp; It&#039;s madness in there, I tell you.

				I was accosted by one helper walking in the door yesterday who wanted to know if I needed help. I said, no, I&#039;m ordering a beer and then heading out back. Well then, I was told, could she get me someone to take my order for me at the table? I said, no, I&#039;d prefer to order here then join my friend already at a table. She said, well then he probably has a server already, you should go out there. I did, and there were about 10 of these &quot;servers&quot; lined up like an army just outside the door. <br />We did get that table service (it seemed mandatory, which was quite off-putting), and we helped her through ordering (seems they are all &quot;new&quot; and none of them know the menu yet). I ordered a Becherovka and was met with an inquisitive glance, one trip to the bar, a return question and finally my friend pointed to the GIANT banner in the yard advertising it and said, &quot;he wants that.&quot; <br />It was really awkward. <br />It was a nightmare. That place is gone.<br />What a damn shame.

				I go to the Beer Garden every summer and I have never once seen a hostess, never once seen more than 2 servers for the entire garden, and we always had to go to the bar for beer service.&nbsp; Service there is notoriously slow and with a surly attitude.&nbsp; That and the crowds is a huge turnoff even though I love the place.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been hoping for a change for years, and if all that eblack says is true, I&#039;m very intrigued.&nbsp; That said, I hope the crowds don&#039;t just break the whole system and I wouldn&#039;t be surprised this doesn&#039;t last.

				I&#039;ve seen servers sometimes but it&#039;s infrequent, and they are usually moving, on their way somewhere else besides my table, even when I try to flag them down.&nbsp; I&#039;ve gotten used to their ineffectiveness when it comes to ordering food.&nbsp; The grill is a better option for me for this reason.&nbsp; I&#039;ve always ordered beer as a walk up to the bar(s).&nbsp; I wonder if they had some serious trouble with this system last summer?<br /><br />Anyway, I sure hope the Beer Garden has plenty of servers this summer because if they don&#039;t, there are going to be mobs of pissed of people who can&#039;t get what they want.

				They have a new manager. According to what they said, they are trying to provide table service for the ordering of food and drinks.&nbsp; The waiter told me that they are putting in additional POS (point of sale) units. I do not like standing in line to get a drink, and then standing in line to get food too. So perhaps this will be an improvement if it works. I never saw tons of servers there until this year. Usually more busboys clearing garbage than servers. Also looks like they are increasing the number of bartenders.

				Yeah, in all the summers I&#039;ve been going there, I&#039;ve only ever seen two or three servers before now and they were usually lost amongst the crowds unless you were lucky enough to get their attention and get a menu.&nbsp; &nbsp;Then they&#039;d actually come back to get your order and bring you food eventually, so that wasn&#039;t so bad.

				Can you still not wear jerseys? I find that rule ridiculious considering it is an informal outdoor atmosphere.

				I stopped by this Friday and Saturday, and it&#039;s just awful.&nbsp; Lines snaking around the place just to get a beer, there&#039;s no place to sit, the place is a madhouse, packed to the gills with people.&nbsp; It&#039;s loud too so you&#039;re shouting the whole time.&nbsp; Friday night I went to the Why Leave Astoria party, but it felt like a high school dance because it was in the auditorium, and the crowd was so young.&nbsp; &nbsp;I left after pizza came and people ripped it apart like rabid dogs.&nbsp; Had dinner at Sparrow instead and ended up at Hell Gate Social, much better.&nbsp; Saturday night, a friend asked me to stop by Beer Garden.&nbsp; The place was nuts again.&nbsp; We managed to get one of those small standup tables, but had no luck with the waitress.&nbsp; She kept saying she&#039;d come back but to no avail.&nbsp; Ever since the place has been written up in Time Out, it&#039;s been invaded.&nbsp; It&#039;s no fun anymore, there&#039;s just too many people.&nbsp; There was a girl from Brooklyn sharing our little table who kept trying to get food too.&nbsp; I told her it&#039;s been like this since it got so popular, and they left soon after.&nbsp; I like to think it was something I said.&nbsp; I too got tired of standing and shouting, and left.&nbsp; I&#039;m so bummed this place has lost its magic for me.&nbsp; I was hoping people would get over the Beer Garden, but they haven&#039;t.&nbsp; Astoria&#039;s lost its secret for good.&nbsp; I&#039;m going to stick with Hell Gate Social from now on.&nbsp;

				I was there this afternoon from about 1:30 to 3:00.&nbsp; When we got there, about 1/3 of the tables had people sitting at them, but by the time we left they were almost all full.&nbsp; When we stepped outside, a server/hostess came up to us and asked us if we wanted a table, sun or shade.&nbsp; It was a bit surreal - why couldn&#039;t we pick our own table?&nbsp; Anyway, she seated us but didn&#039;t give us menus or say that a server would be over or anything.&nbsp; We could see people getting beer at the outside bar on the right, and the grill looked like it was open, but we couldn&#039;t see clearly from where we were sitting whether they were serving food from it.&nbsp; A server finally came and took orders from the table next to us, so we snagged a menu, and she took our order promptly.&nbsp; They didn&#039;t have any kielbasa!!&nbsp; (Or any chicken wings or a couple of other things.)<br /><br />Our food came relatively quickly and was decent for the most part, although one dish (a bit of an adventure pick) that we assumed would be crispy bacon and pickles (I even envisioned deep-fried pickles, but that might be the result of having recently eaten at the Chip Shop) turned out to be cubes of cold very thick-cut bacon that was cured but didn&#039;t look otherwise cooked, and four dill pickle spears.&nbsp; It was really odd.&nbsp; The potato pancakes were very good, and our third dish, a sort of pickled sausage, was ok.<br /><br />By the time we left things were getting crowded, and we were glad to leave.

				We went Friday night (not my idea!) and while we managed just fine, it was <em>packed.</em> The long line out front moved quickly, thank goodness. The lines for everything else seemed daunting, but we always had pitchers at the table- since we were a large group, there&#039;s always somebody from one end of the table getting them.<br /><br />Even with the grill, though, the lines were always long for food. As long as you treat it as a pub and not a place to eat, that&#039;s probably your best bet. The Neptune is close by, as is the pizza place under the Ditmars stop, and Dunkin&#039; Donuts, among other places.

				Just imagine how much easier it would be if the Beer Garden stopped trying to serve food and just let you order delivery? The grill&#039;s lines are too long, the wait staff do their best, but are overrun and generally humorless while the Czech food is the same crap that you&#039;d get in a Czech roadhouse between Plzen and Prague but for 8 times the price (if you want good Czech food - Zlata Praha underneath the 30th Avenue subway). Do what the BYOB places do, but charge a &quot;plating&quot; rather than a corking fee.<br /><br />Could keep the lines down and actually make the place fun for locals when the weather is good. I live 4 blocks away and find myself actually spending more nights in when the weather is good because I can&#039;t face either the Beer Garden or Sparrow across the street because of the number of people who come rushing out to Astoria the moment the sun comes out.

				I was there in early April and I noticed something was different when a hostess welcomed us at the door, instead of the security guys.&nbsp; But man, the service SUCKED.&nbsp; We got waiter service and waited a good hour for our food.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t even crowded.&nbsp; And the guy never came back.&nbsp; My friends didn&#039;t even pay (I left my money with them and went home, since I had a cold).<br /><br />Then last week, I went after the Mets game and it was a mad house.&nbsp; It took longer to get a beer, the BBQ in the back is gone, the second bar outisde is gone and they take credit cards at the remaining bars.&nbsp; I&#039;m actually sort of against that b/c it really holds up the line.&nbsp; When someone closes or opens up a tab, the bartenders are really confused and it takes them a long time to get it all sorted out.<br /><br />I waited about 30 mins for a beer.&nbsp; I asked a security guy if management changed and he went, &quot;You can feel it, huh?&nbsp; You must be a local.&quot;&nbsp; He didn&#039;t like the changes, either.<br /><br />I don&#039;t like it.&nbsp; Terrible changes.

				I went last Saturday with friends, and while the waitress was perfectly nice, it was obvious that she was totally overworked.&nbsp; She forgot our first pitcher refill order and it took at least fifteen minutes to get it once we reminded her (and it took at least ten minutes to track her down).&nbsp; We took to ordering another round as soon as she bought a pitcher by, because it literally took as long as half an hour to get a pitcher.&nbsp; &nbsp;If we wanted to go up to the bar the line would have taken just as long.&nbsp; Beyond the service we wound up splitting a table with several obnoxious girls (clearly not from the outer boroughs) complaining about splinters getting stuck in their sundresses.&nbsp; Fun as it is to be outside with beer in the summer I may have to stick to Sunswick&#039;s from now on. :cry:<br />Not that I don&#039;t love Sunswick&#039;s... :mrgreen:

				we were there on Saturday - it was pretty quiet when we arrived and there was no hostess to seat us.&nbsp; We ordered beer immediately and stupidly I wasn&#039;t ready to order food yet (BIG mistake).&nbsp; &nbsp;The beer came pretty quickly and THEN we put in our food order.&nbsp; And then we waited.... and waited.... and watched the crowd come in and get seated by the hotess... and we watched our neighbors order food .... we watched our neighbors GET their food... watched said neighbors EAT their food... watched as a non waiter came out with a tray of food - scolded our waiter and then disappeared leaving our waiter with a tray (not ours) of food....watched our waiter look confused.... watched our waiter shuffle through his orders 3 or 4 times.... watched the tray of food (not ours) sit... and sit.... and sit (in the sun) .... joked about taking THAT food... watched as a nearby table conversed with waiter ... watched waiter GIVE THAT table the tray of food (not theirs either).... watched our neighbors finish eating... watched our empty pitchers get taken away.... Told our waiter that we&#039;d be leaving now and to please cancel our order if it wasn&#039;t up immediately.... told by waiter to look around at all the people (who were not here when we arrived).... given our beer tab by waiter who DIDN&#039;t bother to look for food b/c he knew it wouldn&#039;t be there b/c he screwed up his orders.... <br />Went to Sparrow and ate burgers (which is what/where I wanted to go in the first place).&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />

				Besides on the sides of restaurants?&nbsp; Central and Cavo are somewhat outside/inside.&nbsp; I hear there is an outside area in the back of Mojave and Stini Yamas(spell check).

				This is an email someone sent me<br /><br /><br />Exciting news! The Bohemian Hall and Beer Garden is gaining a competitor, Studio Square Beer Garden Event Space, which is scheduled to open at the end of May. The space boasts an impressive 18,000 square feet and all the beer-gardeny culinary delights that the heart desires such as bratwurst sandwiches, black Angus burgers, beef and chicken kebobs and pulled pork sandwiches.<br /><br />In addition to the impressive-sounding food--it is a beer garden after all--it features over 15 imported (Spaten and Franziskaner), domestic and draft beers. In addition to bruskis, they&#039;ll also have various spirits and even sangria. I was surprised about this and kind of excited too.<br /><br />In terms of the neighborhood, Studio Square is located near Kaufman Astoria Studios and the Museum of Moving Image, hence its name. The atmosphere will be modern-rustic, with exposed brick walls, industrial fixtures, handcrafted communal picnic tables and fire iron pits.<br /><br />Entertainment promises movie nights and live music throughout the year.<br /><br />I welcome this new addition to the &#039;hood yet it has a lot to live up to with our beloved Bohemian Hall &amp; Beer Garden. An obvious pro will be a less crowded Bohemian Hall but the results have yet to be seen, as Astoria&#039;s current beer garden has a lot of sentimental value and history. We shall see...<br /><br />Studio Square - 35-33 36th Street, Astoria NY 11106<br />718.383.1001<br />N/W Train to 36th Street or R/V/G Train to Steinway Street<br />www.studiosquarenyc.com <br /><br />

				Prepare yourself for disappointment.<br /><br />Well, I once I ordered a &quot;cosmo&quot; but they didn&#039;t have the ingredients. So she made me something else sort of like lemonade with firewater in it.<br /><br />The second time, I ordered a margarita. She took the salt shaker and shook salt into the drink. Pretty hideous.<br /><br />Beer is their thing, apparently.<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard from others at the bar that if you want the hard stuff, go for shots of the various vodkas they have front and center.

				By the way, my kids go to Sokol gymnastics there. Sokol also has a branch in Manhattan that--yes--has a czech bar alongside. And there&#039;s another in New Jersey.<br /><br />I think that the bar originally started as the business model to support affordable gymnastics for kids. The fact that it&#039;s crammed in the summer is even better.<br /><br />A happy thought that your beer helps support hundreds of wiggly bodies get exercise. A win-win situation.

I guess I just always went there order 2+ pitchers from the start, knowing that they had to last until we got a chance to order again. And I&#039;ve never ordered food ... It&#039;s the &quot;beer&quot; garden, not the &quot;bratwurst&quot; garden. ;-) I still think they are doing okay. They are just capitalizing by the brut force method of the sheer numbers of nightly patrons -- aka, quantity not quality.<br /><br />It is however a real shame that so many people on this thread that obviously patronized the beer garden more often than I have in the past few years have seen such a drastic drop in service, but that always seem to be the way things go when something gets trendy. Sorry guys, but the good news is that trends fade, so give it some time and things will quiet down again.<br /><br />

				From what I understand the grill will be opening either this weekend or next (they put new gas lines in)<br />The best time to go (to avoid the maddening crowds) is Monday or Tuesday night or noon on Saturday......I have been going there for close to 20 years and those are now the only times I will go.

				I went on Saturday night with a group of friends at around 9:30, and while it was busy, it wasn&#039;t as nightmarish as I thought it would be. We waited in line for our beers and were able to get a table. It was a really nice night, so I was surprised it wasn&#039;t more crowded, but there wasn&#039;t even a line outside when we got to the door. It&#039;s definitely a different vibe from the last time I went a few years back, but it wasn&#039;t a terrible place to hang out and drink Staropramen outside.

				Went last night with friends, on the earlier (dinner time) side. <br /><br />We waited for over 45 minutes for our food, and had to remind our waitress twice. It came to us ICE COLD. <br /><br />I felt bad, though I couldn&#039;t help but be a little annoyed by it. Our waitress was clearly over worked. We also waited 45 minutes for our bill, and finally had to stand by the doorway to the inside bar and track her down for it. Twice.

				I&#039;ve never known another establishment that struggles with table service quite like the Beer Garden.&nbsp; It&#039;s woefully unprofessional and I wonder if the management realizes just how embarrassing it is.&nbsp; Because of their anemic track record with the service side of things, rarely do I go with plans to order food (well, except for food at the grill, which never required a server to complete the transaction).&nbsp; I&#039;m not happy with that solution, but c&#039;est la vie.

				I went yesterday for the first time this year and was somewhat nervous based on what people have written here lately.&nbsp; Needless to say, my fears were all for naught as it turned out to be a pretty pleasant experience.<br /><br />We got there around 2 and were able to choose our own table.&nbsp; There was a $10 cover due to the Czech Slovak festival going on but we knew this in advance and decided to pay since one of the people in our group was Czech.&nbsp; Needless to say, the cover was actually worth is as the band played nearly nonstop for the four hours we were there and the gymnastics demo was pretty entertaining.<br /><br />As for the service, it was surprisngly good as well.&nbsp; We went up to the bar to get our own pitchers but ordered food directly from the waitress, who couldn&#039;t have been nicer.&nbsp; There were people ordering directly from the grill but we were too lazy to do so.&nbsp; Even though we ordered from both the grill and regular menu the food only took about 20 minutes to come out for a party of seven people.&nbsp; We never had trouble locating our waitress when we needed something and overall the experience was much better than expected.<br /><br />Given it&#039;s close proximity to my house I&#039;m a little more inclined to keep patronizing this place as Studio Square gains popularity as it hopefully will mean that the locals can enjoy the Beer Garden we&#039;ve come to love over the years.

				I went yesterday for the first time this year.My daughter was in a gymnastics exhibition.The food situation was horrid.Slow,confused service.The kielbasa and fries that was $10 last year became $15 once they charged you separately for the fries,added tax and a tip.The worst part was when my wife asked for a little sauerkraut that used to come with it and was told that would be an additional $4.<br /><br />I&#039;ll still drink there,but I&#039;ll eat before I go.

				Rolf/Wunderbar, it&#039;s understandable that you want to promote your restaurant as much as you can, but what you don&#039;t want to do is annoy the crap out of the very people who might go there. People who were considering going there before might be turned off by your incessant, interruptive (and now deceptive) posting about it and end up not going at all. Nobody likes a shill.
