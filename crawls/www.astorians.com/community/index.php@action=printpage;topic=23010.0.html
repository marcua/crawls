				What&#039;s up fellow Astorians?<br /><br /><br />I recently moved into the Ditmars/Steinway area (as indicated in previous posts) and have myself quite a large backyard.<br /><br /><br />I decided to start a vegetable garden despite having 0 experience. My chances of failure are high... Despite this I am determined to make s___ grow!<br /><br /><br />I have planted four varieties of tomatoes, eggplant, red and yellow bell peppers, basil, cilantro, some type of peppers I have never heard of, shallots, bok choi, and thats about it for now.<br /><br /><br />If anyone is interested I will post pictures...<br /><br /><br />If even half of this stuff I planted grows, I will have far too many vegetables, so I am open to suggestions as to what to do with all the extras.<br /><br /><br />If none of this stuff grows, I will live in shame and never return to the Astorians Forums. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Signing out... <br /><br /><br />Smelly Nancy in Astoria

				How lovely! I suggest you can the extra tomatoes for the cold winters where the sun is not abundant. Great for spaghetti sauces amongst other uses. Does anyone have canning experience they would like to share with the Smelly Lady? Quite the green thumb you are becoming...keep up the organic goodness!&nbsp; :cheesy: <br />&nbsp;

				If you are growing in plots that were already there when you moved in, I suggest getting your soil tested.<br /><br />http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/14/garden/14lead.html?pagewanted=all<br /><br />I did this, and was surprised to learn my soil was loaded with arsenic.&nbsp; Who&#039;d have guessed?<br /><br />But if you&#039;re growing in planters, then nothing to worry about!<br />

				Don&#039;t worry about failure.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s a learning process.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m doing this now for my fourth season and there&#039;s been some level of failure each time (including this year)&nbsp; &nbsp;I have very high hopes for next year because I don&#039;t think there&#039;s much left to screw up on my end.&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />can&#039;t wait to see pictures!!<br />

				@ Chinaski I am not growing with planters, so it might be a good idea to get my soil tested. To the eye it seems very healthy, loaded with worms, ladybugs, and other little critters I am not accustomed to seeing. Still this does not mean it is necessarily healthy soil. I did however purchase some organic soil which I placed at the bases of all my plants.<br /><br /><br />I will post pictures soon... All this rain we are getting must be helpful, unless of course it is acid rain which gets absorbed by my vegetables, giving me acid vegetables.

				The issue stems from rain runoff - a lot of buildings were painted before lead paint was outlawed.&nbsp; I did my soil testing at Brooklyn College, and I think it ran me about $20.<br />

				I did plant away from the house. This was not intentional, but could have proved to be a positive thing. <br /><br /><br />Did you bring samples of the soil to the college?

				It&#039;s pretty easy - just fill out a form and mail it in.<br /><br />http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/web/academics/centers/esac/services/soil.php<br /><br />Planting away from the house could definitely help.&nbsp; The trouble with my garden stemmed from a fence that surrounded it made of old pressure-treated wood.&nbsp; It loaded my soil with arsenic and chromium - yum!<br />
