				First off, my apologies to the ACLU who would be be happy if I had said &quot;holiday&quot; song.&nbsp; *sarcasm*<br /><br />To those of you celebrating different holidays, or not celebrating at all, start your own, or ignore this thread.<br /><br />Ok, it seems lately that every artist has a Christmas album of sorts.&nbsp; Haven&#039;t liked much of what I&#039;ve heard.&nbsp; All recycled similar sounding versions of the same old songs.&nbsp; (There&#039;s only so much you can do with Silent Night and I won&#039;t even bring up Streisand *makes face*)&nbsp; These however, are some of my favorites, both covers and originals.<br /><br />Christmas Time -Bryan Adams<br />New Your Christmas -Rob Thomas<br />Do They Know It&#039;s Christmas -Band Aid<br />Please Come Home For Christmas -Eagles<br />Father Christmas -The Kinks<br />Christmas (Baby Please Come Home) -U2<br />Santa Claus is Coming To Town - Bruce Springsteen<br />Christmas Wrapping -The Waitresses&nbsp; (that&#039;s right, isn&#039;t it?)<br /><br />I&#039;m sure I&#039;ve forgotten some, but I have no idea where my 45&#039;s are.<br /><br />Looking forward to hearing some of yours.<br /><br />And yes...&nbsp; I know it&#039;s not even Thanksgiving yet.&nbsp; :-P

				I do think of Christmas Wrapping as one of the greatest new classics.<br /><br /><br />Strangely, one of the rare happiest things about winter is hearing<br />again about the Christmas Donkey. Fun to sing year-round.<br /><br /><br />One of the strangely magical songs:<br /><br />And I see forests and it&#039;s the 25th of December<br />and my old man plays the piano for Christmas.<br />He plays the piano for Christmas.<br /><br />And we&#039;re all there, all the aunties and uncles,<br />and the angel&#039;s on the top of the tree.<br />Up there o the top of the tree.<br /><br /><br />And I never, no I never ever realised.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />And I&#039;m sitting, sitting on the top of the stairs,<br />and you&#039;re crying out on the towpath by the river<br />with all the swans and all the people walking by.<br /><br />And all of a sudden I&#039;m stuck with an urge to unlock a door<br />with a key that&#039;s too big for my hands<br />and I drop it, and it falls at your feet.<br /><br />Come on, come on, it&#039;s there at your feet.<br />And I never, no I never ever realised.<br /><br />

				<span class="bbc_u">Fairytale of New York</span> - The Pogues<br /><br />Not the cheeriest Christmas song ever, but brilliant none the less.<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">The Chipmunk Song</span> - Alvin and The Chipmunks (obviously an oversight on your list) Well, maybe not the most contemporary of Artists, but lets see about that after the movie comes out&nbsp; :wink:<br /><br />I&#039;m also a big fan of <span class="bbc_u">Christmas Wrapping</span>

				All I Want For Christmas - Mariah Carey. YES I LIKE THIS SONG AND I&#039;M NOT ASHAMED TO ADMIT IT.<br /><br />I do not like any others I&#039;ve heard, unless &quot;River&quot; by Joni Mitchell counts as a Christmas song. I know it&#039;s been on at least a couple Christmas albums.

				My favorite has somehow become a Christmas song, though I don&#039;t think it started out that way.<br /><strong>A Few of My Favorite Things</strong> - John Coltrane version<br /><br />Also:<br /><strong>Merry Christmas (War is Over)</strong> - By John Lennon<br /><strong>White Christmas</strong> - The Drifters version<br /><strong>Fairy Tale of NY</strong> - The Pogues<br /><br />

				Even though I&#039;m Jewish, this has always been my &quot;favorite&quot; christmas song :<br /><br />Grandma got run over by a reindeer<br />Walking home from our house Christmas Eve. <br />You can say there&#039;s no such thing as Santa, <br />But as for me and Grandpa, we believe. <br /><br />She&#039;d been drinkin&#039; too much egg nog, <br />And we&#039;d begged her not to go. <br />But she&#039;d left her medication, <br />So she stumbled out the door into the snow. <br /><br />When they found her Christmas mornin&#039;, <br />At the scene of the attack, <br />There were hoof prints on her forehead, <br />And incriminatin&#039; Claus marks on her back. <br /><br />Grandma got run over by a reindeer, <br />Walkin&#039; home from our house Christmas Eve. <br />You can say there&#039;s no such thing as Santa, <br />But as for me and Grandpa, we believe. <br /><br />Now we&#039;re all so proud of Grandpa, <br />He&#039;s been takin&#039; this so well. <br />See him in there watchin&#039; football,<br />Drinkin&#039; beer and playin&#039; cards with Cousin Nell. <br /><br />It&#039;s not Christmas without Grandma. <br />All the family&#039;s dressed in black. <br />And we just can&#039;t help but wonder: <br />Should we open up her gifts or send them back?<br />SEND THEM BACK!<br /><br />Grandma got run over by a reindeer, <br />Walkin&#039; home from our house Christmas Eve. <br />You can say there&#039;s no such thing as Santa, <br />But as for me and Grandpa, we believe. <br /><br />Now the goose is on the table <br />And the pudding made of fig. (ahhhhhh) <br />And a blue and silver candle, <br />That would just have matched the hair in Grandma&#039;s wig. <br /><br />I&#039;ve warned all my friends and neighbours. <br />Better watch out for yourselves. <br />They should never give a license, <br />To a man who drives a sleigh and plays with elves. <br /><br />Sing it Grandpa!<br /><br />Grandma got run over by a reindeer, <br />Walkin&#039; home from our house, Christmas Eve. <br />You can say there&#039;s no such thing as Santa, <br />But as for me and Grandpa, we believe.<br /><br /><br />Enjoy!

				Not quite contemporary but &quot;Christmas Time is Here&quot; by Vince Guaraldi from <em>A Charlie Brown Christmas</em> (the instrumental version btw, not the one sung by the Peanuts cast.)<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=213PQuV83<br /><br />Actually, the version sung by Scott Weiland of Stone Temple Pilots is pretty good.&nbsp; :rock:

				Well, what is considered contemporary. I guess I took it to mean not a &quot;classic&quot; christmas song, so i think the CHarlie Brown applied, even though I find it a little sad at times.<br /><br />I love &quot;the Christmans song&quot; by nat king cole. I always thought it was magical when I would listen to my mom&#039;s 8-track built in to an incredibly oversized T.V. with a wooden frame incorporating an Lp, radio and 8-track.

				I too find Guaraldi&#039;s piece a little melancholic. Actually, more reflective and introspective, which is how I usually feel during Christmas. For me it&#039;s a quiet time, around the shortest day of the year, to reflect on the year gone by....<br /><br />And yeah, Nat King Cole is one of the best. His entire <em>Christmas Album</em> (I think that&#039;s the name) is outstanding, esp &quot;Adeste Fidelis&quot;. Such a moving, powerful voice he had.....

				This time of year you hear WLTW in about half the places you go to.&nbsp; And WLTW has such a short playlist: &quot;Rocking Around the Christmas Tree,&quot; &quot;Jingle Bell Rock,&quot; &quot;Santa Claus is Coming to Town,&quot; &quot;Winter Wonderland,&quot; &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas,&quot; &quot;The Most Wonderful Time of the Year,&quot; and about a half dozen less-frequently-played songs.&nbsp; Even if I once liked some of those songs, I&#039;m sick of them all.<br /><br />All except &quot;Do You Hear What I Hear?&quot; and the 2x I heard the song this year I could have sworn &quot;Pray for peace, people everywhere&quot; was edited out.

				We got Raul Malo&#039;s Christmas album (Marshmallow World) last year and we all loved it.&nbsp; Felt it was too short, wanted more.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t listened to it since so I can&#039;t single out one song, though I recall the title track being really good.&nbsp; That said, I&#039;m not usually a big fan of Christmas music (The Waitresses being my fave, too.)

				O.K. I&#039;m not the x-mas song liking type.

				I found the CD my mom has that&#039;s a bit different for Christmas music: http://cdbaby.com/cd/jazznativity<br />Bending Towards the Light - A Jazz Nativity<br />&quot;The Christmas story told through jazz with Dave Brubeck, Tito Puente, Lionel Hampton, Clark Terry and others&quot;<br />It&#039;s a concert recording that came out in the 90s. Might not be your cup of tea, but they have some clips up that you can listen to.<br />This is the official site and has more clips and you can read more about it: http://www.jazznativity.com/jn/

				Here are some favorites of mine:<br /><br />Julie Andrews, <em>Greatest Christmas Songs</em>.&nbsp; This album used to be called <em>A Christmas Treasure,</em> and for reasons unknown to me, RCA has tacked on 3 year-round songs at the end, which you can play or not.&nbsp; She has another Christmas album called <em>Christmas with Julie Andrews,</em> which ought to be good.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Greatest-Christmas-Songs-Julie-Andrews/dp/B00004XR5U/ref=pd_bxgy_m_text_b (http://www.amazon.com/Greatest-Christmas-Songs-Julie-Andrews/dp/B00004XR5U/ref=pd_bxgy_m_text_b)<br /><br /><em>The Holly and the Ivy,</em> sung by the choir of Clare College at Cambridge U., conducted by John Rutter.&nbsp; It also had a former name, <em>Christmas from Clare.</em><br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Holly-Ivy-Carols-Clare-College/dp/B0000041VV/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1228626590&amp;sr=1-1 (http://www.amazon.com/Holly-Ivy-Carols-Clare-College/dp/B0000041VV/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1228626590&amp;sr=1-1)<br /><br />And this is an anthology, but a delightful one: <em>Sleigh Ride!</em>.&nbsp; My favorite tracks are Victor Herbert&#039;s &quot;March of the Toys&quot; and Handel&#039;s &quot;Or Let the Merry Bells Ring &#039;Round.&quot;<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Sleigh-Ride-Classic-Christmas-Favorites/dp/B000003FCB/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1228626833&amp;sr=1-1 (http://www.amazon.com/Sleigh-Ride-Classic-Christmas-Favorites/dp/B000003FCB/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1228626833&amp;sr=1-1)<br /><br />This album I&#039;ve heard only in the 30-second sample clips at Amazon.com, but they&#039;re enough to make me want the album:<br /><br />Yo-Yo Ma et al., <em>Songs of Joy and Peace</em>.&nbsp; Not all the songs on the album are actual Christmas songs, but when taken together they have a Christmasy feel.&nbsp; And no, it does not include&nbsp; &quot;River.&quot;<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Songs-of-Joy-Peace/dp/B001BN1V8U/ref=pd_sim_m_69 (http://www.amazon.com/Songs-of-Joy-Peace/dp/B001BN1V8U/ref=pd_sim_m_69)<br /><br /><br />
