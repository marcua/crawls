				Was just wondering if anyone else is having an electric outage? I came home a little before 7 to see that the elevator was out and two neighbors told me all the hall lights were out and at least one room of their apartments. Schlepped upstairs and my bedroom and bathroom are totally out, and part of my kitchen. I&#039;m in a 60-unit building on the corner of 31st Ave and 35th Street and was wondering if this is a larger problem or just something wrong with my building? I tried asking the super but they don&#039;t really speak much English and I couldn&#039;t understand. And ConEd told me I&#039;m the only one who called in a problem, but I find that very hard to believe. It also looks like the businesses across the street are doing fine. Anyway, if you&#039;re having problems, please, please, please call ConEd. The more people to complain the faster they will come!<br /><br />Thanks&nbsp; :|

				Well, I got my electric back. Turns out it was just our building and a fuse outside was blown. Unfortunately this whole thing has somehow messed up my really old desktop computer and now it wants a boot disk and it seems somehow related to all this electric business, but hopefully I&#039;ll figure it out.
