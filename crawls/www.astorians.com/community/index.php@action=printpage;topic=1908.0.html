				Awesome! That&#39;s the best political news I&#39;ve heard in a while...<br /><br />Now, I admit I plead ignorance -- is Weld running for governor? I presume he&#39;s going to shoot for the GOP nomination and not run as an indepedent, which would kill his candidacy, no matter how much he spends (look at Golisano).<br /><br />e: I guess he is. http://www.weldfornewyork.org

				Wow, at least one is happy with the news.<br /><br />Golisano nominally was favored, but perhaps had the better sense to drop out and enjoy his millions, oops billion.<br />So as usual, we have primarily a choice of millionaires.<br />Fat Cat GOP vs Fat Cat Dem<br /><br />And Bloomberg looks down and pities their misfortune.<br />Who needs to be governor when you can have cake and be mayor and enjoy your weekends.<br /><br />(fyi, Faso is making a very hard convincing push for the GOP nomination.<br />Long last democracy might hit NY.)<br /><br />- snarky

				Is democracy as limited in Iraq?<br />Voters may not have a voice here, but at least it seems much safer and peaceful.<br />(and often as predictable as a Saddam Hussein unanimous re-election)<br /><br />Liberty, Equality, Fraternity<br /><br />***<br /><br />http://www.democratandchronicle.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060408/NEWS01/604080314/1002/NEWS<br /><br />GOP candidate takes issue with Minarik&#39;s leadership<br /><br /><br />Yancey Roy<br />Albany bureau <br /><br /><br />(April 8, 2006) — ALBANY — Republican gubernatorial candidate John Faso unloaded Friday on state party leader Stephen Minarik, saying Minarik&#39;s 17-month reign has been a disaster for the GOP. <br /><br />Faso accused Minarik of failing to attract good candidates for the Legislature and Congress and of driving a rift through the party by pressuring grass-roots leaders to get behind William Weld for governor. <br /><br />&quot;The party is being led over the cliff by the state chairman,&quot; Faso said.<br /><br />Minarik, also the Monroe County Republican chairman and Gov. George Pataki&#39;s choice to lead the state party, has endorsed Weld. Minarik has been critical of Faso&#39;s ability to raise the tens of millions of dollars likely needed to run for governor. <br /><br />Faso said Minarik has maneuvered to block him from getting 25 percent of the delegate vote at the state Republican convention next month, a threshold that would trigger a September primary. Former Secretary of State Randy Daniels also is seeking the nomination. <br /><br />Minarik &quot;is trying to foreclose a primary, which he is not going to succeed at,&quot; Faso said while talking to reporters at the State Capitol. &quot;He is trying to exert pressure on various people ... county chairmen and the like.&quot; <br /><br />In a statement, Minarik did not address the fight for convention delegates. He refrained from criticizing Faso and said the GOP, starting with a round of candidate interviews last summer, has used an open process. <br /><br />&quot;There is no question that John Faso and I have different opinions of who should be our candidate for governor this year,&quot; Minarik said. &quot;But at least our party is providing John an opportunity to seek the nomination.&quot; <br /><br />YROY@Gannett.com <br /><br /><br />

				(no, not cutie)<br /><br />The Queens Tribune looks to have a fine current edition.<br />There is a quote I love in the one article. (On the ground, realistic representation should be more common in NYC)<br /><br />And immigration discussions could hardly be more relevant for Queens.<br />(Dont we know we are home to every language, every cuisine, every talent, every economic engine, every quest for opportunity,...)<br /><br />http://www.queenstribune.com/<br /><br />Chasing Their Dreams: Queens’ Illegal Immigrants Hope For Freedom&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />[Feature Story]<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />http://www.queenstribune.com/news/1144947157.html<br /><br />&quot;Council’s Met Threat ‘Extortion’: <br /><br />&nbsp;A rendering of the new Mets stadium. <br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />&nbsp;<br />By ANDREW MOESEL<br /><br /><br />Queens officials said last week that they will not back the new Mets stadium unless the team donates additional money to the community. <br /><br />The stadium negatively impacts the quality of life of the surrounding neighborhoods by increasing traffic and pollution, and the sports franchise should have to contribute something in return, said Councilman Hiram Monserrate (D-Corona). <br /><br />Monserrate said the new stadium’s construction, planned on the parking lot adjacent to Shea Stadium, will temporarily remove thousands of spaces from the area, further inconveniencing residents fighting for a spot on game day. <br /><br />“This does not make me anti-Mets. I’d love them to win the World Series, and I want them to stay here. But I also want them to be good corporate neighbors,” Monserrate said. “If anyone can speak out about that, it’s the councilmen who are on ground zero of the new stadium.” <br /><br />The Mets offered to pay $200,000 a year for little league uniforms, but Monserrate and others are asking for $1 million annually and 20,000 free tickets for special groups, sources said. <br /><br />The Mets have not supported the community over the past 30 years as much as sports clubs elsewhere, Monserrate alleged. They balked at an offer to provide the uniforms for all the high school baseball teams in exchange for community approval of the new stadium, he said. <br /><br />Mayor Michael Bloomberg criticized Monserrate and other elected officials for attempting to “extort” money from the Mets over a project that promotes economic development. <br />Building the new stadium will bring 6,000 new jobs and tens of millions of dollars in tax revenue to the City, the Mayor said. <br /><br />“Every development project in this city cannot be an excuse to extort money out of the developers, and I think that’s happened many times too often recently,” Bloomberg said. <br /><br />Councilman Peter Vallone Jr. (D-Astoria) also reacted skeptically. “Why not ask them to pencil me in at shortstop and [councilman Joe] Addabbo at first base?” he wrote in an e-mail to the Queens delegation. “C’mon people, let’s come back to Earth.” <br />...&quot;<br />

				<br />From: &quot;Weld for New York&quot; &lt;info@weldfornewyork.org&gt;<br /><br />Believing in Our Communities<br />&nbsp;<br />Bill Weld recently delivered his vision on how to strengthen New York to the Republican National Hispanic Assembly at a luncheon in Yonkers. <br /><br />Bill delivered his remarks in Spanish about providing immigrants the opportunity to work towards citizenship, offering tax relief, and providing choices for families in both education and health care. The crowd enthusiastically embraced Bill&#39;s proposals to empower families, but cheered the loudest after hearing his initiative to eliminate the state income tax for those earning less than $75,000 per year. <br /><br />Bill reminded the group that, as Governor, he will unite all communities to work towards bringing change to New York. <br /><br />...<br /><br />Full text of the speech | En Español <br />http://www.weldfornewyork.org/news/Read.aspx?ID=98<br /><br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />More about Bill Weld: <br />Weld became governor of Massachusetts in 1991 at a tumultuous time, when the state&#39;s bond rating was near junk status, unemployment was nearly 10%, and the state had continuously borrowed money to close huge operating deficits. Weld restored order to state government: he balanced six budgets in a row, passed 19 tax cuts without any tax increases, reformed Medicaid, a major &quot;budget buster,&quot; overhauled the antiquated workers&#39; compensation system, and significantly reduced the size of state government. In the year Weld left office, 1997, it took 15,000 fewer state employees to run the government&#39;s operations than it had in 1988. Mr. Weld is widely credited with improving the business climate in the state by reducing taxes and state regulations on businesses. Prior to becoming governor, Mr. Weld served as the Assistant U.S. Attorney General in charge of the Criminal Division of the United States Department of Justice in Washington, D.C. <br /><br />If you believe in Bill Weld’s ideas and vision for a stronger New York, <br />please share this newsletter ...<br /><br />&nbsp;:mrgreen:<br />(mrgreen has no identified position on political statments made by others...)<br /><br />[I like tax cuts; I like balanced budgets; It would be interesting to see the details.<br />My guess is that rolexes and escalades might be harder to come by, but if you got it then what are you worried for] - TRx<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />
