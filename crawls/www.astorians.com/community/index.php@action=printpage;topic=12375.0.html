				Hi,<br />I just moved into a new place and I have a feeling that my landlady will go into my apt.&nbsp; I found out that she kicks out alot of her tenants and I don&#039;t want to be the next.&nbsp; I was told by another tenant, that the landlady found the previous tenant passed out on his living room floor and stuff.... my thing is ITS His apt, if he wants to be passed out then fine, but how did she know if there was no emergency that she had to go in...????<br />Let me explain, me and my hubby moved in June, she went away for the WHOLE summer.&nbsp; My hubby works the night shift so he gets home at 10am.&nbsp; well the day that she came back she came to say hi and to also tell us that the neighbors say that we are too noisy in the daytime.&nbsp; Noisy..... ITS DAYTIME, all he does is play XBOX or sleep..... they should be happy its not at night....<br />anyway I have a bad feeling that she will come and go from my apt whenever she wants.&nbsp; I mentioned to her that I was interested in getting a security system, since I am home at night alone and she was madamant that I not get one, that it isn&#039;t needed.....<br />so I was wondering if anybody knows another alternative to just make sure nobody goes into my house, with out them knowing its there???

				Froggy, do you have a lease?&nbsp; If, so did you take a look at the lease to see if there are any provisions about the landlord entering yoru apartment?<br /><br />I would set up something like a nanny cam so you can see if she is in fact entering your apartment when you are not around.

				There are a bunch on Amazon.&nbsp; I&#039;d imagine they are fairly easy to set up - just point it at your front door or something.<br /><br />Someone on the original thread I posted had a webcam (I believe) which would work just as well.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_e?url=search-alias%3Delectronics&amp;field-keywords=nanny+cam&amp;x=8&amp;y=19<br /><br />

				This is a tutorial for Windows users on setting up a motion-detection cam. Some PC savvy is required.<br /><br />http://www.simplehelp.net/2006/09/27/how-to-use-your-pc-and-webcam-as-a-motion-detecting-and-recording-security-camera/<br /><br />I set up one on Linux using the program &quot;motion&quot; and it works pretty well. It takes a lot of pictures of my cat when I&#039;m not home. :P

				Forget cams, you can always set up one of those baby devices that sits a top any door. <br /><br />My neighbor used to have one of them for her child and anytime the door would open it would ring real loud. You can always turn it off at any time too so that it won&#039;t be annoying. But you would have to turn it off from inside the household (closed area).<br /><br />It&#039;s cheap, affordable and the most effective way to deal with intruders.

				booby traps, like a bucket of paint over the door&nbsp; :lol<br /><br />I once had a lecherous landlord who said he came in to close my windows when it rained. The windows were open just a crack&nbsp; :? People told me back then, &quot;He should NOT be in there unless there&#039;s an emergency, like a fire.....and even THEN he should call you first!!&quot; <br /><br />I just changed the locks without telling him after that.&nbsp; :roll:

				Kung Foo,<br /><br />Thanks for the link I am going to buy a webcam and try this.&nbsp; just some questions, even if my comp is on sleep&nbsp; mode, will it wake up with a motion.&nbsp; Also will it take 1 pic, or multiple..... each time somebody passes the comp?&nbsp; does it save with date and time?

				So, I wonder Froggy, what do you plan on doing armed with this information.&nbsp; You live in a private house which affords you limited if any protections by landlord/tenat law.&nbsp; Not to say that your landlord should be allowed to enter your apartment, she shouldn&#039;t.&nbsp; But what action can you take?

				Well hopefully I wont have to take any action, cause she wont go into my apt.&nbsp; But to be sure that she isn’t, somebody from this site (sry I forgot your name) send me a link to set up my web cam as a motion sensor to take pics and email to me should their be a motion in my house, when I am not there.&nbsp; If&nbsp; I do find out that she was in my apt, I wont confront right away, well depending what she is doing, but I will gather evidence and go to her and then the police.&nbsp; I don’t know all the laws, but I am sure that there has to be a law preventing her from hanging out in my house whenever she wants.&nbsp; I am going to try to install the web cam today, try is the main word……<br /><br />I don’t know if I mentioned this before, but I also found out that my downstairs neighbor found out that she was paying coned for her apt and the apt next to her, and she confronted landlady who continued to deny, till she had con ed investigate, and sure enough it was TRUE, she was paying for 2 apts.&nbsp; That is so Shady!!!!!<br />
