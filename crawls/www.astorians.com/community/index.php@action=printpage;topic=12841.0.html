				So for the first time since high school, I will be walking in to a polling place, as opposed to filing an absentee ballot for an election, and google has been of no help with this so far.&nbsp; I would like to go into Tuesday being confident that the person who gets my vote is the one I believe in the most, so I was hoping that somebody here could point me in the direction of a list of positions that I will be voting on and the candidates running for those offices, so I can soothe my candy hangover with some political reading this weekend.&nbsp; <br />I appreciate your help.

				While 3 or 4 or more voters say we might soon be in a great depression, surveys say nearly 60% are hopeful that Obama <span class="bbc_u">would </span> be a good President.<br /><br />I expect to vote for several parties on Nov. 4<br /><br /><br />Wish Americans very well.<br />Vote wisely.

				It really bugs me that all these people are on the ballot, but, aside from the presidential candidates, it&#039;s difficult to find much information about any of them. You&#039;d think, with technology and internet accessibility these days, every candidate for every office would bother to put up a basic website that details his/her views, but no. This is how we get so many people that vote for parties rather than candidates.

				The link that enigmacat posted offers a web link for each candidate.&nbsp; I think that I only found one that wasn&#039;t right.&nbsp;

				<br /><br />http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/11/04/1635579.aspx<br /><br />NADER: I HAVE ONLY ONE WORD FOR YOU... <br /><br />Reporters played along with little protest and reached for questions that led to one-word answers. Many even started asking one-word questions, though that wasn&#039;t in the rules.<br /><br />But there were some telling moments. Here&#039;s a sampling:<br /><br />What is your opinion of Obama?<br /><br />How much money did you raise for your campaign?<br /><br />What is your opinion of the media?<br /><br />...<br />
