				I keep walking by and have been meaning to stop in, but I usually am walking by too early or too late. Looks cool, glad to have it. I live off of 23rd ave and am sad that it&#039;s kind of like a grave yard for new businesses. They opened up Seek Fitness and a yoga/aerobic place right next to eachother, and in my opinion both would have a hard time staying up and running, never mind two nearly identical places right next to eachother. Anyone else think this?

				PJ, you skate?<br /><br />don&#039;t know if they timed it to set up shop just about when you astoria park skatepark was opened, but i doubt they would have survived without having the skatepark nearby.&nbsp; i see skaters with their boards on the subway get off on Astoria Blvd. most likely to go to the skatepark, i doubt they would come all the way out here just to go to a skateshop when they could head in the other direction into manhattan to a bigger, more established shop.<br /><br />i haven&#039;t stopped in yet, but pass it just about everyday.&nbsp; haven&#039;t skated in ages, and skatestyle has been played since the mid 2000&#039;s.<br /><br />i think they will survive just by having the skatepark as an anchor.&nbsp; it will build a strong core of skaters who spend money there long after the skatestyle fashion trend is long over.
