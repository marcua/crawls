				i hate working in a cube. i hate the bright lights and communal living. i decorated the heck out of it for years but lately took all that down for a fresh start. everyone was wondering what was wrong with me <em>(it really was way crazy with the random pictures and toys everywhere).</em><br />with the holidays driving me crazy at work i decided to go a different route to help maintain my sanity. yesterday with the help of a co-worker i decided to &quot;construct&quot; an office for myself. this gives me more privacy and quiet. <br />so far its a hit.<br />what do you do to help the office not be so blah?<br />(http://static.flickr.com/99/315375868_a246ea0ff6.jpg)<br /><em>that stuff on the bottom left is part of the crap i had on my walls....</em>

				A view usually helps brighten up an office.&nbsp; Or maybe one of those tabletop light up scrolling window displays that you get in Chinatown.

				Yesterday to make the office not so blah, I hid my neighbor&#39;s mouse in a jello mold while he was on vacation.&nbsp; It camouflaged so well he had to go searching for it.<br />(http://img213.imageshack.us/img213/7097/lookingformouseov5.jpg)<br />Pwned! :wink:

				I didn&#39;t see that episode, but a few people did pick up those blue yoga balls to replace their desk chairs.&nbsp; I get a reoccurring urge to go out them with a pair of scissors, ala The Office.

				i have a non cubicle that the actual cubicle behind me looks directly into. it&#39;s fun having every convo i have heard by 3 people and knowing that whatever i am doing can be seen on my giant monitor by the dude behind me. <br />my desk has also become the supply room since almost a year after moving in the building isn&#39;t finished yet. yay
