				I have t-mobile so I don&#039;t know about Sprint but when my phone has broken I just call and they send me one that&#039;s free in the mail.<br /><br />You should insure it though, it&#039;s only 3 bucks more a month and covers you for sure when it breaks.

They should replace it for free.

				There is also a sprint store on 31st and Ditmars, or at least it&#039;s says Sprint on its awning.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t think it&#039;s just a storefront but I could be wrong.&nbsp; Besides the official one at Steinway, there is an official one on 48th St just off of Northern Blvd next to Stop n Shop.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t been in years though, so I&#039;m not sure it&#039;s still there.

				My experience has been that if you complain politely for long enough, you can get a free phone.&nbsp; <br /><br />With Verizon, I called to complain every time my phone dropped a call.&nbsp; After a while I just asked for a free phone since mine was just not working.&nbsp; They gave me one after I was on hold for a while.&nbsp; (The street value of my free phone: $20 ... but it&#039;s the principal of the thing!&nbsp; Not to mention, the cheapie phone worked.)<br /><br />Good luck.&nbsp; Take it to the store and try to talk to someone who can make decisions.&nbsp;
