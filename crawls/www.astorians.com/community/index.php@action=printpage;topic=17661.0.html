Photographers are explorers at heart and tend to take more photos and discuss technique <br />when accompanied by other photographers. And if it turns out to be a gorgeous day with blue skies and white fluffy <br />clouds, it&#039;ll take even longer. <br /><br />I&#039;d be up for a May photowalk, as long as it&#039;s prior to Memorial Day weekend.
