I think it would be easier to eat a pound of feathers than a pound of lead.&nbsp; You might even get a laugh out of the feathers if you swallowed them just right.&nbsp; <br /><br />And just to say it, I actually agree with MR FZ. Hot dogs are filler food just not as dense or real as a burger. Maybe you should try chopping up one hot dog and putting it in one hamburger. That way you would be technically eating 8oz of meat but more likely 6oz.&nbsp; <br /><br />HEY!&nbsp; I think this is a good idea for a weight loss diet.&nbsp; Combine real foods with fake foods and save 1/4 the calories. <br /><br />I&#039;m stuck at work by the way and losing my $H1t.&nbsp; It&#039;s lonely and too hot.&nbsp; Sounds like when I was single...<br /><br />Somebody rescue me.

				I agree that hot dogs can have filler, but my point was that 4 oz. of hot dogs weighs the same as 4 oz. of hamburger, no matter what the ingredients are.&nbsp; My point about the calorie count and macronutrient ratios is the same as yours - that the ingredients that go into making up those 4 oz. are probably what make the difference.<br /><br />For kicks, I looked up the ingredients of Sabrett 100% beef hot dogs.&nbsp; They are:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Ingredients: Beef, Water, Salt, Contains Less Than 2%= Sorbitol, Flavorings, Paprika,Garlic Powder, Hickory Smoke Flavor, Sodium Erythorbate, Sodium Nitrite, Nisin Preparation.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No filler.&nbsp; That&#039;s not to say that that all of the ingredients are stuff you&#039;d want to eat all the time, but all the extra &quot;stuff&quot; are flavourings or preservatives.<br /><br />PP - the feathers would probably tickle, but the lead would be harder to chew.&nbsp; Might crack a tooth.

				No the point is that the hamburger fills you up more even though you eat 1 bun with it, and two buns with the hotdogs.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried putting two hot dogs in one bun, I&#039;ve also made long thin hamburgers to fit on a hot dog bun, and two hotdogs on 1 burger bun.<br /><br />I think the real solution is to eat <del>french fries</del> freedom fries with every meal.

				You could also make a double hot dog pannini. Two grilled hot dogs, laying on 3 slices of crisp bacon, covered with strips of aged, extra sharp cheddar cheese on one bun, then pressed and toasted. I&#039;d serve it with a Dijon mustard dipping sauce, and, of course, I&#039;d only be using all beef, preferably Kosher, hot dogs.

				Or to make a real nice &quot;meal&quot;, you could do what the Bubbe of my childhood friend used to cook, which we all loved as children. A meatloaf with a hot dog in the middle.
