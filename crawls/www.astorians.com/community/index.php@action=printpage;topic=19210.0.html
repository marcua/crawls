I&#039;m not convinced there has been but for arguement&#039;s sake let&#039;s say there has been. It would only be newsworthy if the increase was significantly higher than the rest of the city.

				Some reasons why crime is surging is because of the economy and the influx of young people who are inexperienced with life and it is easier for criminals to take advantage of those who do not know much about Astoria or New York in general.

				<br />Saw article this morning.<br />DN - Crime Makes Comeback<br /><br />General news, some anecdotes, poli quotes, and stats.<br />What struck me is focus on domestic violence, and increase of murder elsewhere in Queens.<br /><br /><br />The rest of the paper read to me like a crime blotter.

				This happened right around the corner from me.&nbsp; My parents who also live nearby were awakened by the shots.&nbsp; <br />Sorry to see there are so little details about this reported in the news.&nbsp; It makes me think there is nothing being done about it.&nbsp; To be fair Long Island City is better than some other neighborhoods and worse than others.&nbsp; There will always be some bad along with the good. <br />I remember when there was <em>much more bad </em> in this neighborhood..
