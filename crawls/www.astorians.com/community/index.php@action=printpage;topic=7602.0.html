				Our police officer resources are seriously misguided. Today as I was driving in upper ditmars to park my car in front of my house, a cop car is coming at me, the wrong way down a one-way street...were they in pursuit? trying to stop a crime? No. It was easier for them to give tickets this way because they could see expired registration and inspection stickers without getting out of their car. <br /><br />I stopped them, and calmly asked if they were aware that this was a family block, with children running around and many of us not expecting a car to come the wrong way down the one way. I then said &quot;is this allowed&quot; and was told &quot;yes, we are police officers&quot;<br /><br />I called the police commissioner. It is in fact NOT allowed, and the car was called in. I&#039;m still upset though and furious with the laziness and misplaced resources of the officers. Any thoughts?

Some may, but MANY do not. Of course this is from my own interaction talking to people that have made that decision, and while I would love to think that altruism is a guiding factor, I can&#039;t get behind it 100%. <br /><br />This is an important job, but I&#039;m also not about to give credit to individual police officers and certainly not the ones that would rather break the law and risk the life of adult and children pedestrians, cyclists, runners and drivers in order to avoid getting out of the car and walking past in order to survey an expired inspection and give a ticket. There is NOTHING about that I can get behind. <br /><br />I also can&#039;t get behind the attitude with which blocking Ditmars in order go into Dunkin Donut&#039;s to get a coffee with no regard for other people. <br /><br />Regarding resources allocated inappropriately, I stand by this in Astoria as well. Suddenly, in the past few week, we have seen an influx of police presence at high noon on Ditmars, on the train platforms during rush hours, and on broadway during mid day....and yet, walk down ditmars at 11 at night, and....nothing...I know, because I do this several times a week. Even after the attack of a young woman on Ditmars. I am not an expert on allocation of police officer resources, but this just doesn&#039;t make sense. <br /><br />Why don&#039;t fireman have the same arrogance. That is a job which you are guaranteed situations that are lifethreatening. And yet, a fireman has never given me an attitude, nor have they blocked ditmars with their firetruck to stop and get a bottle of poland spring.

				I deal with cops on a regular basis. The majority of the ones that I&#039;ve come in contact with have been pompous jerks. I can count the number of polite, by the book cops I&#039;ve dealt with over the years on one hand. <br /><br />My clients are kids. Routinely, my clients come to court after being arrested for minor offenses (graffiti, smoking pot, trespassing, shoplifting), covered in cuts and bruises after being roughed up by cops. My clients have described situations where much larger police officers have flung them to the ground, dug their knees into their backs, and smashed their heads into the concrete sidewalk. One young man (arrested on a train platform for blocking subway doors) was thrown down the subway station stairs. My clients&#039; parents ask me what they can do -- I suggest the CCRB, going to the precinct captain, complaining to their local council member -- but my clients are predominantly poor people of color whose complaints often fall on deaf ears.<br /><br />I guess what I&#039;m trying to say is that cops blocking Ditmars for some donuts, talking on their cell phones while driving, or standing around on duty with a cigarette dangling out of their mouths are really minor when you consider the truly unlawful things they get away with every day. Talk about an abuse of power...

				The abuse of power is evident. <br /><br />TAlking on cell phones is one thing. Just lucky for me that I wasn&#039;t riding my vespa as the cop car was pulling out of my block the wrong way causing me to crash into the car and risking my life.<br /><br />I&quot;m just still pissed at the attitude and general disregard.

				I am going to have to really temper my response, because I can see that I am outgunned in this thread on my very pro law enforcement views.&nbsp; I&#039;m such a square.&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; <br /><br />You guys don&#039;t seem to be very big on the &quot;Broken Windows&quot; theory of policing.&nbsp; I&#039;m a proponent of this theory myself, so it&#039;s particularly upsetting to me that the cops out by your neck of the woods don&#039;t seem to be actively doing patrols.&nbsp; One of the most important lessons of Broken Windows is that cops riding around in cars (or doing less than that) don&#039;t work.&nbsp; You need cops on the ground, engaged in the community.&nbsp; And obviously, they should not laugh at people who try to engage them, as apparently happened in the case of Alexa.&nbsp; My perception is different, though, because I live in the area of Broadway, and I see tons of cops every day, both on foot and in cars.&nbsp; Also, I worked for a very short time in the Police Commissioner&#039;s office in a civilian capacity when I did a fellowship with the city government.&nbsp; And in my current job, we work a lot with law enforcement agencies.&nbsp; In fact I work directly with George Kelling, one of the people who devised Broken Windows back in 1982.&nbsp; So I have seen firsthand what works and does not work in policing, and I guess to a certain extent it would be fair to say that I have consumed some of the Kool Aid. It was the Ecto-Cooler flavor, which they no longer make.&nbsp; &nbsp;:wink:&nbsp; However, it is an indisputable fact that this city is safer than it has been in recent years, and safer than at any other time.&nbsp; The numbers don&#039;t lie.<br /><br />In regards to the altruism/non altruism discussion, it&#039;s not for me to say what motivates people to become cops.&nbsp; But the fact is that, whether they become cops because they want to help the community or because they want to retire after twenty years, they are all aware of the fact that they are out there to protect us.&nbsp; And they know all too well that this could lead to their serious bodily injury or death.&nbsp; Just look at those poor cops who got shot at close range by those repeat offender car thieves.<br /><br />In regards to what barrister said, we have to keep in mind that the aggressive policing of so-called minor offenses such as graffiti, smoking pot, etc. is part of why crime rates are so low.&nbsp; I don&#039;t mean to suggest that I am in favor of police brutality, and the cases you describe seem way out of line.&nbsp; But, statistics bear out that the policing of such minor offenses precipitates a huge drop in major crimes.&nbsp; It&#039;s not that all people who commit minor offenses commit major ones.&nbsp; But the vast majority of people who commit major offenses also commit minor ones.&nbsp; Case in point, back in the early 90s, the transit police, then a separate department headed by Bill Bratton, started to go after turnstyle jumpers.&nbsp; Violent crimes and other serious offenses plummeted.&nbsp; The proof is in the pudding.&nbsp; The most frustrating thing about negative encounters with the cops is that this perpetuates negative feelings towards law enforcement.&nbsp; Also, it perpetuates the sense of defiance towards authority and air of entitlement which likely led barrister&#039;s clients to commit their crimes.&nbsp; That hurts all of us.

				Sorry I didn&#039;t read the last paragraph of your post closely enough. If you acknowledge that those with minor offenses don&#039;t always commite major ones, why deal with the minor offenses through violent, overbearing reactions rather than try to rehabilitate the offender before they become violent and serious criminals? Why the focus on punitive causes rather than improving our society as a whole? Do you think punishment for crimes does anything for us as a group of citizens living together?

				It is not universally accepted the Broken Windows has been debunked, though many of the elites seem to stand against it. &nbsp;I don&#039;t have the energy to research and mount a full defense of the theory, which will fall upon deaf ears. &nbsp;But suffice it to say that while crime did drop in general in the 1990s, by far the greatest drops were seen in Broken Windows cities. &nbsp;Note for example that Mayor Dinkins enjoyed a 3 percent or so drop in crime his final year in office. suddenly, Giuliani takes over, and the crime rates fall in the double digits. &nbsp;In the documentary &quot;Giuliani Time,&quot; which is pretty much a mouthpiece for Wayne Barrett of the Village Voice to slam Rudy, Dinkins makes the rather dubious assertion that crime rates would have gone down just the same had his administration continued. &nbsp;I highly doubt that we&#039;d see the same reduction in crime over the years in a non Broken Windows environment. &nbsp;It&#039;s no coincidence that the minute Bratton instituted Broken Windows in the subways, crime started to drop.<br /><br /><del>If you reread what I wrote about people who commit major offenses, I was very careful to qualify what I said.&nbsp; I am not suggesting that brutality be inflicted upon anyone, be they the perpetrators of minor crimes that barrister deals with, or major criminals.&nbsp; Nor did I suggest that minor crimes on a record mean that someone will go on to commit major crimes.&nbsp; What I said, and still maintain, is that the vast majority of major criminals commit minor crimes as well.&nbsp; And when you police minor crimes, you actually wind up netting major criminals as well.&nbsp; Interestingly, this is also proving true in the case of terrorism.&nbsp; Many would-be terrorists are busted doing things like selling counterfeit DVDs or untaxed cigarettes.&nbsp; I am not saying that I am in favor of unnecessarily violent tactics, but I feel like some of the so called progressive tactics have had their day and failed.</del><br /><br />Whoops, you reread my post as I was about to ask you to reread it.&nbsp; Thank you!&nbsp; Look, I&#039;m not closed to the possibility of working with minor criminals so that they don&#039;t become violent offenders.&nbsp; But the unfortunate reality is that the gateway is often contact with the system, which can mean being arrested for your criminal offense.&nbsp; And again, I am not for anyone being brutalized.&nbsp; There is a gray area where violence should probably be employed, such as those who resist arrest in a bodily way.&nbsp; But I don&#039;t think that anyone should be preemptively beaten by cops.&nbsp; On the other hand, I am all for people being charged with criminal offenses.&nbsp; If this can lead to some sort of program that will empower them to steer clear of crime, then great.&nbsp; If that program is community based, rather than a government program, all the better.&nbsp; Punishment for crimes does do something for us as a society.&nbsp; It helps maintain the rule of law which holds us together as a cohesive society.&nbsp; I&#039;m not a cultural conservative or anything, but it&#039;s pretty clear that I am as conservative as heck on this board.&nbsp; :-o

				I mean, I&#039;m open to the idea that appearance of a neighborhood can influence one, but that hasn&#039;t provided any strong, statistical evidence that it is what made the change. There are lots of other possibilities with stronger indicative measures. <br /><br />It&#039;s funny, too, that the article posted mentioned Anthony Braga and it seems to steal quite a few phrases directly from him without quote or citation. <br /><br />At any rate, I think there&#039;s a big difference between arguing (which I&#039;m not trying to do) and the free exchange of ideas (which I&#039;m trying to do). The article at the very least led me to Braga and while I&#039;ve just started reading the articles I&#039;ve found, I&#039;m interested to see where his position goes and why the article writer drew the conclusions about Braga that he did and to see if I concur.<br /><br />I&#039;m not steadfast in a belief that broken windows is wrong, I just think there&#039;s a perponderance of evidence to insinuate that the drop in crime in 1990s is not reliant upon the broken window theory and that labeling it as such is a misnomer and not giving credit to the other factors of social import working at that time.

				Also, in fairness, much more goes into Broken Windows policing than the physical appearance of the nabe.&nbsp; Most simply put, if people see that quality of life infractions go untended, there comes to be the perception that greater offenses will be tolerated over time.&nbsp; The famous metaphor being that broken windows in an apartment building lead to the understanding that the building is untended, leading to the acceptance of greater transgressions.&nbsp; George Kelling never meant to imply a direct connection between quality of life crimes and major crimes.&nbsp; It&#039;s an indirect, though very strong, connection.<br /><br />It&#039;s fun that Alexa started this discussion over cops going the wrong way down a one way street!&nbsp; I don&#039;t think she could have forseen this impromptu policy roundtable.

				I&#039;m trying to find some empirical studies (in between the stuff I&#039;m actually supposed to be researching).<br /><br />I know it&#039;s more than just appearance, but the issue is whether police action actually dictates crimes committed. Ugh. Long politity type stuff.

				http://legalaffairs.org/webexclusive/debateclub_brokenwindows1005.msp<br /><br />Some puddin&#039; ?<br /><br /><em>Why is there no reliable evidence supporting broken-windows policing? The answer is, there&#039;s no good reason to believe that disorder is causally related to crime. There are only two social scientific studies that explore the relationship between disorder and crime on large data sets—the Sampson and Raudenbush study of Chicago neighborhoods that I mentioned yesterday, and Jens Ludwig and my newest study on MTO—and both of these studies undermine the idea that disorder causes crime. <br /><br />This raises probably our sharpest disagreement. You write that the social sciences have &quot;asked the wrong questions&quot; and suggest that they should instead weigh in, somehow, on the fact that graffiti and panhandling &quot;are wrong.&quot; But that&#039;s a moral, political, legal, and aesthetic judgment, not a social scientific question. The social sciences have been asking the only appropriate questions for social scientific inquiry in light of the broken windows hypothesis. I&#039;d be happy to debate whether disorder is &quot;wrong,&quot; but realize, that doesn&#039;t call for scientific reasoning. It doesn&#039;t call for regression analysis or ethnography. <br /><br />And ultimately, I don&#039;t think that &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; are the correct categories. Those terms don&#039;t begin to capture the complexity of order and disorder. Once we move away from the narrow social scientific inquiry, then a whole new set of questions arise, and they&#039;re different than the ones you mention. The proper questions are: How do we define disorder? Who defines disorder? How do we come to believe that any conduct is disorderly? In other words, what do we see as disorderly and at what price? You suggest that disorder, in contrast to crime, &quot;is what you can see.&quot; That, I believe, is what the debate is really all about. </em> <br /><br />It&#039;s also a back and forth debate that&#039;s on that page, so it might be worth reading.<br /><br /><br />And Billz, I&#039;m not a &quot;progressive&quot; either. And I&#039;d doubt barrister wants to be labeled, but I&#039;ll let her speak to that. I&#039;m just somebody who tries to make their own decisions about what&#039;s true, what&#039;s right and what&#039;s wrong.

It&#039;s cool. I have accumulated many negative nods here.

People pick up a label (be it conservative or progressive or liberal or libertarian) and start looking at the world through those ideas rather than looking at those ideas through the world. Now, I tend to be social liberal and fiscally conservative, but that shouldn&#039;t decide how I feel about crime, taxes or the death penalty. We have to look at things honestly and I think it&#039;s hard to do that and have an open, honest and free exchange of ideas when people restrain themselves because their self or otherwise labeled viewpoint seems in the minority.

When arrested, they&#039;re brought to the precinct and are to be kept separate from the general population in the &quot;juvenile room.&quot; The parents are to be contacted immediately. Any interrogation is to be done after Miranda warnings are administered to both the child and their parent (a rule rarely followed). Kids are supposed to be released to a parent or brought to court as soon as possible (if the arrest takes place during court hours). Again, this is rarely done. I once represented a 10-year old boy held in Spofford (the secure juvenile jail in the Bronx) for an entire weekend for stealing a Yu-Gi-Oh card from another kid. The poor kid was traumatized after a weekend of being housed with violent kids who were significantly older than him.<br /><br />No counseling is offered, no services provided until after the case comes to court. Once the case does come to court, then the probation department can &quot;adjust&quot; a case -- where the case is handled directly by probation and the kid never sees the judge -- or they can refer the case up for filing. Once the case is filed, it goes before the judge and the case follows a path similar to that of any adult criminal case, albeit with slightly different timelines.<br /><br />And I understand that Billz not advocating the use of excessive force, but I do think to some extent he&#039;s justifying it and frankly, I can&#039;t see the justification for any degree of force to be used on a kid. Even if the kid wasn&#039;t beaten by police, I often see kids who come in with red welts where handcuffs were put on too tight, clothing is torn, or the cops spoke to the kids using obscene racist and sexist language. If the parents of these children treated them that way, the kids would be removed by ACS and an abuse/neglect petition filed against the parent, yet the police treat kids like that on a regular basis. Problem is, who is going to believe a kid?<br /><br />

They also have to deal with the most mundane to serious crap every day. We live in a city where firefighters and EMS techs, people whose only role is to help and save lives, yet are sometimes, harassed, pelted with garbage and assaulted while on the job. Can you imagine what the police are subjected to? How can you not develop a layer of arrogance? <br /><br />So like you, I may be annoyed when cops give attitude, drive the wrong way up a street or block Dunkin’ Donuts and other incidents of a**hole-like behaviour but am willing to let it go.<br /><br />Barrister&nbsp; -- I really respect that you take an compassionate, active role in the system and for your dedication (because I guessing you don&#039;t do it for the money) and from what you point out it confirms a trend that I find disturbing --the current attitude of criminalizing minor incidents in regard to children and increasingly adults. But are the police driving this trend or reacting to it?<br />

They also have a terrible reputation (before and after Katrina) of brutalizing young offenders. And while correlation is not equal to causation, it may be the kind of thing worth noting.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=7602.msg89448.html#msg89448">Quote from: Billz1981 on August 23, 2007, 04:38:38 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> Also, if the abortion point were true, you would have seen a drop in crime to correlate with the advent of the pill.&nbsp; But actually, crime was high in the 70s.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I disagree with this statement for a number of reasons. First, birth control and abortion are not the same thing. You&#039;d need to do studies of the demographics of people utilizing BC upon its invention and of people utilizing abortion upon its legalization. I&#039;m not saying this statement isn&#039;t potentially true, merely that we don&#039;t have substantial evidence to confirm nor deny this. There are all kinds of factors that would need to be looked into to use this as a negating proof on the abortion arguement.<br /><br />I also think it&#039;s pertinent to pay attention to these other possible influences: the enforcement of Rockefeller drug laws, the crack epidemic and increased employment rates. There&#039;s more, obviously, but the important thing is to think of the 1990s crime drop as a group of related socio-economic fluxuations that caused demographics to shift and mutate.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve got friends who are cops (in the 114, too) and they&#039;re the first to admit that some of the guys they work with are bad dudes. Even in my small PA hometown, there was one crooked nasty S.O.B. on the force. I think in every precicnt you&#039;re going to have at least one guy who is in it for the power, but it&#039;s important to remember that there&#039;s a division between each individual in any given job and just like there are lawyers like barrister, there are also lawyers just out for the power and the money. I&#039;ve been arrested by good cops and bad cops and I&#039;ve heard the stories of a good cop losing it on one day or one case. Not to say it&#039;s right, but it does happen. The real problem is that there doesn&#039;t seem to be a proper method of restraining and punishing the police officers who go too far or are too physical with people who do not warrant that kind of pressure without limiting them too severly in moments where they may need to make crucial decisions to save their life and the lives of others.<br /><br />Like anything, it&#039;s a potent balance that we have not yet achieved, but I do not think that means it is impossible.

				I&#039;m not &quot;from&quot; NOLA, but I&#039;ve got those friends that might as well be family there and I spent quite a bit of time working hurricane relief there (right up until I moved to Astoria) alongside the firemen who stayed and we had some altercations (read as &quot;shouting matches&quot;) with the returning police. I won&#039;t go into specifics on the internet, but it was a very negative experience. And my experiences were nothing compared to others that I met there.<br /><br />As far as Heart of Darkness, it&#039;s a really great book that (like Apocalypse) gets into what it means to be a civilized man in the world. My favorite part is this section where the narrator asserts that it takes either a saint or a fool to be good in the wild.<br />

The idea behind the bullets was to shot the people climbing the outside of Fenway in the back and get them to come back down. They had been inadequately trained with the equipment. While Victoria was not doing anything with the riot, she was in the crowd. I went to Emerson and knew her through the journalism programs there. And while the students were upset and such, this was not a case of unwarrented police brutality, it was a case of police being given equipment without appropriate training and being thrown into a situation they were afraid of.

				A few months back I had a conversation with a couple police officers, asking them to send a few more patrol cars around the side-streets to try and enforce the dog-curbing law and they pretty much shrugged the suggestion off, even after I told them it was a major problem in our neighborhood. On the same note, my mom asked a cop on LI if there was anything they could do about it out there, and the cop said the law is pretty much &quot;un-enforcable&quot;, even if you take pictures of the person letting their dog &quot;go&quot; and subsequently walking away. So I guess that&#039;s why no one picks up after their dogs anymore...<br /><br />Did anyone see Superbad?&nbsp; I feel like the cops in it weren&#039;t too far off!
