				Yea I saw the sign&quot; Public Auction&quot; then a closed for Renovations sign. They kind of had it coming. All these years they failed to put money back into the business and update it. They had ok Greek food but nothing special compared to the rest of the Greek restuarants in Astoria. I never saw a female waitress too. It was always a couple of creepy older Greek guys eyeing my female friends. I wish this place stays Greek though. Hopefully another Greek owner takes over transforms this places and makes a great Greek restaurant!

				I agree.&nbsp; I have fond memories from that place too.&nbsp; But the time had come.&nbsp; Bring on something fresh, new, and great.&nbsp; With Bahari already there, maybe a really good Greek seafood for Broadway along the lines of Psari.

				This is a good thing. I know too many people who were food poisoned from that place. They weren&#039;t exactly clean. There are a lot of better options in the neighborhood if you want souvlakia.

				<br />&nbsp;I&#039;m 30 this year, as&nbsp; a kid I remember going into Sanford&#039;s at night with my dad, having pancakes,&nbsp; &nbsp;eggs, all sorts of&nbsp; greasy spoon food, loving it, I ate in new Sanford&#039;s twice , it sucks.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Astoria had many&nbsp; better places in old days, I only remember Penna (31st off Broadway)&nbsp; &nbsp;and The Bank (36th and Broadway)&nbsp; &nbsp;the later which would draw people from Manhattan to this area in a time when&nbsp; coming to Astoria to eat was practically unknown for&nbsp; Manhattanites.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think Vesta sucks too, but people love it.&nbsp; <br />Uncle Goerges had soemthing like a 30 year run, now places open, get very popular, then close in 2 years.&nbsp;

				Uncle George&#039;s had a long run, but it was different ownership the last few years, and it sounds like the product got a lot worse. I understand nostalgia for the &quot;good old days&quot; but I tend to think the dining scene in Astoria is pretty darn good right now.

				I have a ton of great memories at Uncle George&#039;s.&nbsp; Great, simple food and wine at dirt cheap prices.&nbsp; Open at all hours.&nbsp; A surly yet consistent wait staff.&nbsp; You always knew what to expect there, and you were never disappointed.&nbsp; I always wondered if the old woman who usually operated the cash register was related to Uncle George.&nbsp; I do agree that in the last few years, the quality of the food declined and the prices went up.&nbsp; I unfortunately went there less and less in the last few years.&nbsp; Many other places in the neighborhood have better food (and definitely better ambiance), but don&#039;t feel as cozy as Uncle George&#039;s did.&nbsp; Thanks for the memories!

				I don&#039;t think the article is correct that Uncle George&#039;s has been open since 1978, at least not in that location on Broadway.&nbsp; I recall it opened either in the late 80s or the early 90s.

				I ate there a lot when I first moved to Astoria in the early 90s, but in the last few years, avoided it - the last two times I ate at Uncle George&#039;s I got sick.&nbsp; Always surly waiters.&nbsp; The Tzatziki was good though.<br /><br /><br />I ate at Penna once and it was a weird experience.&nbsp; They didn&#039;t seem to want me and my date there (but maybe it was the gay thing more so than the non-member thing).&nbsp; I&#039;d always thought it was a social club until I was told it was open to the public.&nbsp; My date thought it was the best food he had in NYC.&nbsp; I thought it was ok.

I think rapidly rising commercial rent is main reason for Uncle George closing.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />If rents keep rising like they are, it&#039;s possible no place in Astoria we like today will be around in 10 years.&nbsp; I find that a&nbsp; bit scary. <br /><br />

				I remember when Uncle George&#039;s expanded back in the 1990s on 33rd St.. They took over a place that was near and dear to my heart, a Chinese Hand Laundry (which don&#039;t seem to exist anymore in Astoria) where I took my dress shirts to be cleaned, ironed &amp; pressed. The hand laundry moved to 41st St. &amp; 31st Ave. &amp; even though I lived at Broadway &amp; 32nd, I followed them and continued to bring my shirts there until they went out of business 10 years ago or so.

				Just passed by it early today and realized it&#039;s been like a year now since it closed.&nbsp; Same sign that says restaurant coming pasted on the door is still up there. I wonder what&#039;s taking so long for anything to open up. Anybody have any new update?
