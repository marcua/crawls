				Multiple trips to the C-Town on Broadway have turned up empty. Out of all the grocers in the Broadway area they were the only ones who had it. Associated, Bravo, Pathmark and Stop &amp; Shop have never had it. I&#039;m slightly addicted to it since it&#039;s tasty and somewhat healthy (yogurt cucumber garlic, how can you go wrong?)<br /><br />At this point, as long as I know the store in question has it, I&#039;m willing to leg it up to Ditmars. I haven&#039;t tried any Greek shops because quite frankly I am unfamiliar with most. I&#039;m willing to go there as well, as long as I know where it is and that folks have been happy with the store. <br /><br />The catch is that is has to be the Fage one. I bought some other version from the Associated by my office in Manhattan and the consistency is quite different and is certainly not as healthy as the Fage (30 calories for 2 tablespoons, which is more than enough for one warm piece of pita, as opposed the random one which is about 100 + calories for the same serving size. For that many calories I basically have one whole grain cracker, which makes it a less enjoyable eating experience). <br /><br />Between me and John we go through a container a week; faster if I use it as part of a meal or have friends over. I&#039;m in withdrawl!! And that other brand just isn&#039;t cutting it (I&#039;d tell ya what it is but I&#039;m too lazy to go downstairs to the fridge and identify it).<br /><br />Help me....please.....

				I would definately check with Titan Foods to see if they have it.&nbsp; It&#039;s a Greek Grocery Store on 31st St just south of the N/W Astoria Blvd stop.&nbsp; They sell the Fage Yogurt for sure, but they probably have the tzatziki as well.&nbsp; <br /><br />Titan Foods<br />(718)626-7771<br />http://www.titanfood.com/main.htm (http://www.titanfood.com/main.htm)

				I&#039;ve been buying it at C-Town all year. If not longer. When did the Bravo open? I remember hoping that since they&#039;re related to C-Town they&#039;d have it and save me the much longer trip (this was when I lived 2 short blocks from the Bravo). The funny thing was that I checked just about every market near me and never saw it except at C-Town. Plenty of Fage yogurt but no tzatziki. <br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if it had been there and it never registered with anyone because it wasn&#039;t something you were looking for. Then you see the thread and remember you saw it; activated that brain cell so to speak. <br /><br />Oh and that other brand I got that&#039;s still sitting in my office fridge (tzatziki sauce never lasts that long with me-one of Sunday&#039;s containers is almost gone) I still can&#039;t get the name to stick, but I took another look at the nutritional label and the calorie content is actually 200+ calories for 2 tablespoons as opposed to 30 calories for the same serving of Fage, and it tastes waaaay better (and I don&#039;t feel bad about having eaten most of a container in a few days). <br /><br />Thanks to this board I will always have places in Astoria to get my fix. <br />And for those of you who haven&#039;t tried it; in case you can&#039;t tell I think it&#039;s super yummy and you should try it!<br />Unless you make your own, then I can&#039;t compete with that. But you&#039;ll have to share&nbsp; :-D

				I went to Key Food on 31st and Ditmars last night all ready to eat a tub of this stuff, and there was none there.&nbsp; D&#039;oh!&nbsp; I looked in the dairy section, and saw the Fage yogurt, but no Tzatziki sauce.&nbsp; Is it located in some mystery spot that I just missed?

				Gotta try it! I used to buy tzatziki from Christos, but alas no more! I don&#039;t think it was Fage. This brand is imported from Greece. I wonder how it compares to freshly made? <br />For all of you wanting to make your own tzatziki:<br />If you use Fage plain yogurt you don&#039;t have to put it in cheesecloth over a bowl to drain the excess liquid (unless you want to) because it&#039;s already thick. <br />After you&#039;ve shredded or chopped the cucumber salt it lightly and let it sit in a strainer over a bowl for a few minutes (30 minutes). Later squeeze out all the water from the pieces with your hand. The salt leaches out the water from the cucumber. Now your tzatziki will be nice and thick-not watery!<br />Don&#039;t forget the garlic and a bit of vinegar. Optional-a little chopped dill.
