				So i was in UWS yesterday wandering around and had hankering for some coffee, i wander into Cafe Lalo and notice they had many many treats as well! So I wait for and get a table. I&#039;m all excited, and I wait for a waitress. <br />One comes after five minutes to bring food to the girl at the table next to me, ignores me. I figure, well, who knows, maybe it&#039;s not her section.<br />I wait five more minutes. A guy sits down at the table to the left of me.<br />I wait another five minutes. <br />A DIFFERENT waitress comes to HIS table, and expressionlessly takes his order, and again, ignores me!!!<br />WTF? I sit for a few minutes dumbfounded, and finally decide f___ THIS, and go to leave. I grab the host dude who seated me, a fey italian-ish chap. I tell him, that I sat there for fifteen minutes while two different waitresses served the people around me and I never got waited on. <br />He kind of puts his finger on his chin and stares at me blankly and says, &quot;yah?&quot;<br /><br />I would have tripped a waitress on my way out but they were busy ignoring other customers in the corner at the time.<br />YUCH!!<br /><br />

				&quot;Hipster&quot;? Aw come on, it&#039;s fair to gripe about a fair number of things hipster, but a cafe on the UWS that was featured in &quot;You&#039;ve Got Mail&quot; I don&#039;t think can be blamed on the hipsters. <br /><br />&quot;Hipster&quot; is not a general term for anything you don&#039;t like -- it&#039;s a term for *specific* types of places you don&#039;t like, of which this doesn&#039;t sound like one of them :-)<br /><br />And it seems many shared your feelings (sans hipster) over at Yelp (http://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-lalo-new-york). It sounds like you made the right call by leaving - mold!
