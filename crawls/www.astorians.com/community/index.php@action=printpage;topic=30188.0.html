				I just got an email from the organizer that they are going to open this Saturday at the Hall of Science.&nbsp; &nbsp;They are just finalizing details on the last few vendors.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am psyched.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Went with a friend tonight. I have high hopes for this night market but the first night was a little tough. We got there at 6:30 and the lines were so long (and barely moving) that we had to leave. It was very hard to tell what food was at each stall, particularly from a distance with the long lines, and my vegetarian friend couldn&#039;t find anything he could eat. The food looked good, though--we just couldn&#039;t get to it. There was Burmese, Japanese, Chinese, Taiwanese, arepas, some kind of mystery crepe situation, grilled corn &amp; lemonade, tasty looking sandwiches stuffed with sliced meat and onions, and some interesting tea as well. They had a couple of dessert options too. As we left there were still people streaming in, so it looked like the situation was only going to get worse, not better. <br /><br /><br />This market has a lot of potential. Clearly the interest is there, but they need more vendors who have enough food that they can quickly turn around. I hope to go back another time, but I may go with a plan B ready just in case.

				Not too much at the moment -- they did have live music and maybe about 4 non-food stands that sold artisan crafts like handmade greeting cards and scarves. I assume they&#039;ll be building that out and developing it further as they get underway.
