				As some of you know, I started an after school program last year and I have had quite a few inquiries by Astorians.com members as to whether we will continue in the fall. After seeing what worked and what didn&#039;t, and in response to parent feedback, I think we have a very good and affordable option with our new vision of Serious Fun, but we would need a firm commitment from families to go forward. In looking over the school age child care programs and interviewing parents, I found a lot of confusion over what options are out there.<br /><br />I thought it would be helpful to have a neighborhood get together to talk about what&#039;s out there, and let people know their options, including Serious Fun. So we&#039;re is sponsoring a neighborhood meeting featuring some entertainment for the kids by one of our partner groups, Song and Beat and inviting all interested neighborhood parents with school age children to talk about it over coffee and donuts. Please encourage anyone who is interested in this topic to come and add to the discussion and help us all find the right fit for our families. The information is below:<br /><br />***********************************************************<br /><br /><strong>Do you need after school child care for the 2009-10 school year?</strong><br /><br />Please share your child care experiences and questions at our<br /><br />School Age Child Care Coffee &amp; Conversation<br /><br />11:00 – 12:00 noon, Saturday, June 20th, 2009<br /><br />Steinway Reformed Church<br />41-01 Ditmars Ave (at 41st Street)<br /><br />Family entertainment provided by Song &amp; Beat<br /><br /><br />Come have coffee and discuss after school care options available in our neighborhood, including:<br /><br />• <span class="bbc_u">Sports and Arts Foundation Champion</span>s Program at PS 122<br />• <span class="bbc_u">Beacon</span> Program at IS 141<br />• <span class="bbc_u">Serious Fun</span> and other private care programs<br /><br />If you are a childcare provider, please bring information on your program.&nbsp; If your a parent with experience, please tell us about it.<br /><br />Let’s help each other get informed so we can figure out what works best for our families
