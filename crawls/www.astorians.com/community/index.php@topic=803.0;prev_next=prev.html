								<div class="inner" id="msg_4649">F.A.Q. (frequently asked questions)<br />&gt; Q: Okay, I&#039;ve read your call. And I sure don&#039;t like Bush. But is it really as<br />bad as you say?<br />A: No. It&#039;s probably worse. There is no doubt that there are crimes being done and<br />plans being hatched that are beyond the ones listed in our call and beyond your<br />imagination. On top of this, way too many people are letting themselves get lulled<br />into a gradual acceptance of the outrages that are going on, and allowing themselves<br />to be blinded to the actual direction of things. So it is as bad as we say and it&#039;s<br />getting worse.<br />&gt; Q: But it&#039;s not fascism yet, is it?<br />A: No it&#039;s not. But what&#039;s your point? That we should wait &#039;til it is, when it&#039;ll be much<br />much harder to defeat? And look B if all this is not bad enough for you already, if you<br />can look at Abu Ghraib or the indefinite solitary detention of Jose Padilla solely on<br />Bush&#039;s say-so, if you can watch the debate over whether Harriet Miers is &quot;Christian&quot;<br />enough to sit on the Supreme Court, if you can do all that and more without puking<br />and still console yourself that at least it&#039;s not fascist then something&#039;s wrong. You<br />know it and we know it.<br />&gt; Q: I don&#039;t like those things either, but it seems as if Bush is actually losing<br />power. First there was Cindy Sheehan and falling public support for the war<br />in Iraq, then all the anger around his handling of Katrina, and now even<br />people in his own party are attacking him about Harriet Miers. Isn&#039;t the Bush<br />presidency really on the rocks? Won&#039;t it just sink of its own accord?<br />A: No. While the Bush Regime has suffered some important political setbacks, it is<br />like a wounded animal, most dangerous when cornered. So long as he is president,<br />there are many ways that Bush and his regime can bounce back and re-seize the<br />initiative. For instance, Daniel Ellsberg, the man who exposed the Pentagon Papers in<br />the 70&#039;s and who knows quite a bit about the inner workings of the U.S. government,<br />has warned that the Bush administration is counting on another 911 type incident to<br />change public opinion and enable the regime to bring in a draft and a clampdown<br />&quot;that will make the Patriot Act look like the Bill of Rights.&quot;<br />On the other hand, Bush is hurting and if we don&#039;t seize the initiative now, if we<br />don&#039;t press our advantage, if we don&#039;t all throw in and demand his ouster, if we are<br />stupid and passive enough to allow him to regroup . . . then SHAME ON US.<br />&gt; Q: But who will replace Bush? Won&#039;t it just be worse?<br />A: To answer the second question first, no, it won&#039;t be worse; it will be much, much<br />better, it will be like removing a forty-pound tumor from your gut. We will be a hell of<br />a lot closer to ending this obscene war in Iraq, to ending the American torture camps<br />at Guantanamo, Abu Ghraib, Bagram and who know where else, to stopping religious<br />fanatics from deciding who makes the laws, to the right to abortion not being under<br />imminent threat, etc. How in the world will that be worse?<br />And, by the way, there won&#039;t be a &quot;President Cheney&quot; either this movement is going<br />to send Bush, Cheney and the rest of those fascists packing, and they can take their<br />whole damn program with them.<br />What there will be is a people that have driven out a monstrous clique and are newly<br />Page The World Can&#039;t Wait - Drive Out the Bush Regime! e 1 of 6<br /><a href="http://www.worldcantwait.org/faq.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.worldcantwait.org/faq.html</a> 10/18/2005<br />energized and organized and ready to take society in a much much better direction.<br />&gt; Q: Yes, but what does come next?<br />A: Again, the first thing that &quot;comes next&quot; will be an energized people, in their<br />millions, that have lifted their heads and are finally acting for basic social justice.<br />After that, there are people in &quot;World Can&#039;t Wait&quot; who are working for everything<br />from impeachment to communist revolution. And isn&#039;t debating that out a hell of a lot<br />better than talking about &quot;how much more can we take before we move to Canada?&quot;<br />&gt; Q: But aren&#039;t there communists in World Can&#039;t Wait?<br />A: Yeah, there are. Supporters of the Revolutionary Communist Party helped initiate<br />it. They&#039;re in it because they think it&#039;s absolutely urgent to get rid of this regime, that<br />it would both lift a huge burden from the world and would also give people a sense of<br />their own potential power, and they think all that would open up avenues to get to<br />the society they want. Same as a whole lot of other people in World Can&#039;t Wait<br />which, by the way, includes Greens, Christians, Republicans, anarchists, Muslims,<br />Jews, feminists, Democrats, pacifists, and people who claim no affiliation who also<br />think it&#039;s urgent to drive out the Bush Regime and who also think it can help lead to<br />bigger changes that they want in society, coming from their own viewpoints.<br />But to turn the question around, if you refuse to pitch in to November 2, when you<br />know that this is what has to be done, just because there are communists in it, then<br />you need to think about how well that worked back in Nazi Germany (when the many<br />forces opposed to Hitler could not find the ways to unite). And how exactly would you<br />explain your particular brand of &quot;abstinence only&quot; policy to a prisoner at Abu Ghraib<br />or a teenager in Tennessee who desperately needs an abortion or someone whose<br />mother was killed at a checkpoint near Falluja? And then after you think about that,<br />you need to actually start working on November 2. To stand aside at this point is<br />really unconscionable.<br />&gt; Q: But what about the Democrats? Why can&#039;t we make them fight harder,<br />and then vote Bush out in 2006? That sounds more realistic.<br />A: If you&#039;re trying to actually stop the Bush program and reverse the direction he&#039;s<br />taking society, that&#039;s the most unrealistic plan possible. First of all, the Democrats<br />won&#039;t win. And second, even if somehow they did win, a) they agree with the<br />Republicans on the war and repression and many other major issues, and b) they<br />won&#039;t challenge them on the ones they don&#039;t agree on.<br />And besides let&#039;s stop being like Charlie Brown, eternally hoping that Lucy won&#039;t pull<br />the football away as we run up to kick it. Face it: if you asked this question, you&#039;ve<br />been pouring your hopes, money and energy into the Democrats for years now. And<br />how&#039;s that been working for you?<br />&gt; Q: What if this polarizes people?<br />A: Good. You need argument and debate in order to change people&#039;s minds. You<br />need lines to be drawn sharply for people to get up and act and make change. You<br />need all this to get society to move. Name any progressive change that didn&#039;t<br />polarize people. The problem right now is that people are finding too many ways to<br />live in the moral shadows of this regime.<br />The people in power right now are wreaking terrible suffering on the world and they<br />Page The World Can&#039;t Wait - Drive Out the Bush Regime! e 2 of 6<br /><a href="http://www.worldcantwait.org/faq.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.worldcantwait.org/faq.html</a> 10/18/2005<br />are attempting to bring down even worse. Anyone who supports them is WRONG,<br />and they need to learn that. The people trying to drive out this regime are doing a<br />great thing, and they are RIGHT, and they need to start acting like it. And the people<br />sitting on the fence are. . . well, they need to get off it. Now. To refuse to take a<br />stand when the fate of the world is at stake is morally bankrupt and unacceptable.<br />&gt; Q: Maybe you&#039;re right. But it seems so hard to take on a whole regime.<br />Wouldn&#039;t it be better to take on one thing like the war, or torture?<br />A: People should righteously fight against every outrage, and we should all support<br />such resistance. But all these outrages are part of an entire program, an entire<br />direction, that is right now represented by these people in power and unless they are<br />stopped, that program will not be deterred. Again, without taking anything away from<br />those fights, we don&#039;t want to fight over deckchairs or even lifeboats on the Titanic,<br />when we need to change the whole direction of the ship.<br />&gt; Q: But you&#039;re talking about hundreds of thousands and eventually millions.<br />Can we really get all those people mobilized? Can we really realize the vision<br />in the Call?<br />A: There are millions of people who not only voted against Bush, they poured their<br />money and time into working against him. They didn&#039;t do that because they loved<br />John Kerry, they didn&#039;t do it because there was this or that part of Bush&#039;s agenda<br />that they objected to they did it because they were sickened by the whole direction<br />of this country under Bush. If anything, more people feel that way today than ever.<br />Our Call speaks to these people; our demand is their demand. The more we&#039;ve gotten<br />this messabe out there in radio ads, with the Call, and so on the more that people<br />have responded and stepped forward. And yes we have a lot more to do to reach the<br />goal a hell of a lot. But if we spread the word fast enough and far enough, if we<br />really organize with all we&#039;ve got in these next two weeks, if we reach into their<br />hearts, if we work and think and struggle like we never have before. . . then we can<br />do it. The potential exists. It has to be realized.<br />And it can be. If you help make it happen. November 2 can and must be a real<br />beginning the day that marks the beginning of the end of the Bush Regime. This<br />CAN be done if you join in.<br />&gt; Q: But &quot;regime change&quot; is scary.<br />A: Not as scary as &quot;regime staying in power.&quot;<br />&gt; Q: I just don&#039;t know. There&#039;s too much tradition in this country, too many<br />good people, too many safeguards, for fascism to get established. I just<br />think that it can&#039;t happen here.<br />A: And where have we heard that before?<br />* * * * *<br />from 9/29:<br />From the organizers: We think it&#039;s a great thing that the most common question is<br />not whether we should drive out the Bush regime, but whether it&#039;s possible, how<br />we&#039;re going to do it, and what will replace it. We appreciate your feedback as we<br />Page The World Can&#039;t Wait - Drive Out the Bush Regime! e 3 of 6<br /><a href="http://www.worldcantwait.org/faq.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.worldcantwait.org/faq.html</a> 10/18/2005<br />continue this conversation.<br />&nbsp;Is this possible? How do you drive out a regime? What will November 2nd look like?<br />&nbsp;If we drive out the Bush regime, what will replace it?<br />&gt; Is this possible? How do you drive out a regime? What will November 2nd<br />look like?<br />In recent years, millions have spoken out, protested, refused to comply with<br />outrageous new repressive measures, given money, voted, and more. Still, the Bush<br />juggernaut of war, repression and hurtful fundamentalist morality has rolled ahead.<br />All this has shown two things:<br />1. There are indeed tens of millions who are deeply disturbed by and opposed to the<br />whole direction that the Bush administration is dragging our world into.<br />2. The will of the people means nothing to the Bush regime. The people&#039;s will must be<br />forged into an organized political resistance which repudiates and reverses the<br />whole direction of society, and forces Bush himself from office.<br />Of course, everyone wants to know exactly what steps will be taken to create a<br />political situation where these things happen. But setting out to drive out a regime, in<br />particular this regime, in this country has never been done before and it is not<br />possible to say exactly what steps will be required or what its final days will look like.<br />The future is unwritten. Right now, we need very urgently to start writing a new<br />chapter.<br />Think about this: When four young people sat in at a lunch counter in the South, they<br />didn&#039;t know exactly what forms of struggle the Civil Rights movement would develop<br />or how many and who would join them. When women and doctors developed<br />networks to provide abortions and held speak-outs to make it legal, they didn&#039;t know<br />exactly what court ruling or piece of legislation would codify this right.<br />They did these things because living one more day without resistance was<br />intolerable. And, by doing what was right and not compromising, they set new terms<br />for society, changed what was deemed possible and realistic and were able to<br />galvanize and activate many thousands more in ways that couldn&#039;t have been<br />predicted.<br />Today we are facing an unprecedented situation. The challenge is bigger, the stakes<br />are higher, and the window of opportunity is being hammered shut rapidly. There is a<br />moment to seize right now while public support for Bush is at its lowest and millions<br />are seething with anger and aching with desire to affect things. The world cannot<br />wait. The Bush regime must be driven from power. But, we must leave the<br />comfortable ruts of familiar territory and politics-as-usual if we are to stand a chance.<br />Think of how many people were inspired by the uncompromising and courageous<br />stand of Cindy Sheehan. We are in a moment when one person stepping boldly<br />forward, pointing out that the emperor not only has no clothes, but is a lying, callous<br />brute, can change the whole national discourse. Imagine what can happen when<br />hundreds of thousands, on one day, refuse to bite their tongues or stay at home.<br />November 2nd, 2005 will be a launch of a new kind of movement, a societywide<br />resistance. It holds the potential to break open new space and possibilities for<br />Page The World Can&#039;t Wait - Drive Out the Bush Regime! e 4 of 6<br /><a href="http://www.worldcantwait.org/faq.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.worldcantwait.org/faq.html</a> 10/18/2005<br />the struggle going forward.<br />November 2nd, 2005 must be a day when history starts to turn.<br />November 2nd will be a day when those who hate and fear the future Bush is<br />creating will pour into the streets together, out from beneath the suffocating<br />“mandate” Bush claimed last November 2nd, out of the “acceptable” political<br />framework that forces people to speak in “reasoned” tones about compromise<br />positions, out of the dynamic of fighting Bush&#039;s outrages one at a time constantly<br />losing ground to the whole onslaught, out of the logic of waiting…and waiting…and<br />waiting for someone somewhere else to say what must be said and do what must be<br />done, while each day people grow accustomed to unspeakable crimes.<br />On November 2nd, in society-wide outpourings – in large cities and small towns,<br />emptying high schools and colleges and lining the highways in rural areas, buzzing<br />through the media and provoking frank debates among families, friends and<br />coworkers – we will say: NO MORE! WE REFUSE TO BE RULED IN THIS WAY! BUSH<br />DOES NOT REPRESENT US AND WE WILL DRIVE HIM OUT! THE WORLD CAN&#039;T WAIT!<br />Everyone will be clear – this outpouring is just the beginning of a new kind of<br />movement which takes the offensive in society and really wages a pitched political<br />battle for the whole direction of the future. The gatherings will bring together the<br />impatience of the youth who walk out of school, with the experience of those from<br />the 60&#039;s generation, with the stature and voices of prominent artists and intellectuals,<br />together with the anger and perspective of those who have been hardest hit by the<br />Bush program of repression and heightened poverty and racism. The organizers will<br />direct participants to trade phone numbers and emails with other protesters, to start<br />up discussion groups and book-clubs about fascism and resistance movements,<br />building communities of resistance going forward.<br />By bringing together hundreds of thousands nationwide in outpourings of many sizes<br />which become the lead story in small towns and large cities on the news that night,<br />this day will give heart and inspiration to millions of others who are looking for a way<br />to stop this direction and will very quickly draw them into an organized resistance. It<br />will put a challenge to many who still support Bush, causing them to question and,<br />for some, begin to break with a program that is not in their interests. It will also give<br />notice to the regime and its die-hard supporters that they will not have a free-hand in<br />reshaping the world, leaving them further exposed in the eyes of millions.<br />This day alone will not stop the regime, but it will introduce a whole new dynamic and<br />will enable millions to make a big leap towards a movement that can stop it. This day<br />will embolden individuals and groups everywhere to speak up, to defend others who<br />come under attack, to challenge the Bushian mentality and program everywhere it<br />pops up – from the local school boards pushing “intelligent design” and Abstinence<br />Only, to the pulpits promoting hurtful intolerance of gays and non-Christians, to the<br />unjust war and continuing torture, and beyond.<br />November 2nd is a day for which thousands must immediately throw in all their<br />energies and time, creativity and critical thought, connections, skills and finances to<br />pull off on a scale that accomplishes this important beginning.<br />From there, further organization and planning will be required, but all of it will be in a<br />new context and with new strength. As organizers of the World Can&#039;t Wait – Drive<br />Out the Bush Regime, we pledge to take responsibility for leading and broadening the<br />core of those leading this all the way through. We will hold a national summit to chart<br />our next steps, bringing to bear all the strength and momentum and lessons we have<br />gathered and surge ahead on a higher level which impacts the terrain again<br />nationally and internationally.<br />Page The World Can&#039;t Wait - Drive Out the Bush Regime! e 5 of 6<br /><a href="http://www.worldcantwait.org/faq.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.worldcantwait.org/faq.html</a> 10/18/2005<br />Years from now, when children want to know the character of their parents -- as they<br />lived in a country that was normalizing torture, moving to condemn half the<br />population to enforced motherhood or back-alley dangers, attacking science and<br />critical thought, waging wars of preemption based on outrageous lies, snatching<br />people off the street without lawyers or charges, and no major office-holder was<br />making a stink – they will ask, “Were you in the streets that day, on November 2nd,<br />2005?”<br />&gt; If we drive out the Bush regime, what will replace it?<br />Our government&#039;s agenda, actions and direction are intolerable. We must act now;<br />the future is in the balance.<br />What the world needs most at this moment is massive and broad political resistance<br />to the Bush regime. We can and must bring millions of people into motion to stop and<br />reverse the political direction the Bush regime is dragging the country and the world.<br />We must drive the Bush regime from office.<br />The question of what will replace the Bush regime should be discussed and debated<br />as we join together and work shoulder-to-shoulder toward our common political goal.<br />There are, there will be, and there should be many diverse views on this question<br />among us. Our unity is embodied in the Call and our main slogan, The world can&#039;t<br />wait—Drive out the Bush regime!<br />Answered from another angle by the World Can&#039;t Wait Youth &amp; Students:<br />What is the point of the question? Are you saying that if we don&#039;t have a full vision of<br />where society needs to ultimately go that we should not go anywhere? Are you<br />saying that people should not unite broadly on a great need that desperately calls out<br />to be done, by millions of people all around the planet, because people disagree<br />about what to do once that need is met?<br />Let&#039;s take this outlook into other realms. Imagine being in a prison, and knowing that<br />everyone in there, or the vast majority of people, were unwillingly there and wanted<br />to get out. Now imagine you had a plan to break through the walls. You had a vehicle<br />that could bust the wall open and free the prisoners, but you heard that it would take<br />all of the people, or the majority of the inmates, to unite to operate the vehicle in<br />order to bust through the wall, and, in order to do that, people needed to first escape<br />their assigned duties that the guards were telling them they needed to stay within.<br />If you heard this plan, saw its viability, and saw, while difficult, it was reasonable,<br />and achievable, in fact the only way to actually get out of the prison, would you say,<br />“well, f- this plan, I am not getting down if you don&#039;t know what we are going to do<br />once we get past the walls.”<br />THAT&#039;S CRAZY! When the walls come down, a whole new world of possibility will open<br />up, and we need to have talked about what we should do with the potential that does<br />open up. But as we do so, let&#039;s not lose sight of where we are, and where we will be.<br />And let&#039;s not lose sight of the fact that a more appropriate analogy may not be a<br />prison, or even a plantation. A more appropriate analogy may be a ghetto, or a<br />concentration camp.
