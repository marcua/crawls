				Really, what kind of music do you play?<br />Is the club hip and trendy?<br />Is it the hottest night club in town?

				I forgot my Sarcasm flag.&nbsp; I&#39;ll lay it on thicker next time.&nbsp; <br />Should have just cut and pasted what&#39;s on the other threads verbatim.<br />Thanks for ruining my joke. :-(

				Please rest assured that I recognized and deeply appreciated your sarcasm and all the work that went into it and I am aware of the rich history on this subject. <br /><br />Lorem ipsum is dummy latin text used by web designers when mocking up pages they don&#39;t have text for yet. It&#39;s not supposed to be shown in a production environment, though - only testing.&nbsp; Whoever is in charge of their website appears to have made a slight error.

				Well I&#39;m glad my sarcasm was appreciated.<br />I didn&#39;t realize you literally meant their website had the phrase lorem ipsum on it (I&#39;m also not down with the web designer lingo).&nbsp; I thought you were just telling me to go to their nye post for the details.&nbsp; But I just went to check it out but couldn&#39;t get that far.&nbsp; They&#39;ve got bigger problems than lorem ipsum.&nbsp; It&#39;s slow to load, the navigation is unintuitive (that rubs me in such the wrong direction), completely undermining usability and functionality for unnecessary flash that I would just rather skip over.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you&#39;re listening NY Humanistic... I went there to see events, specials, club info and I should be able to view all of that within seconds without having to sidestep flash (give the user the ability to skip the flash intro before it loads, not after) and without having to guess which icon to click on or rollover.&nbsp; DAMN IT... I just wasted another 2 minutes of my life I&#39;ll never get back.&nbsp;

				It&#39;s actually the &quot;read more&quot; under the menu tab. Which is at the bottom. <br /><br />Yeah, the moving pictures are cute but if you really want to find information it&#39;s a struggle.

				And here I thought that language was something intelligible... Darn.<br /><br />The more mystery that abounds about this place, the more excited I get about going.&nbsp; I&#39;m just so excited.&nbsp; Really, just so very very excited.&nbsp; I can&#39;t wait to check it out next year and report back.&nbsp; &nbsp;How will I sleep not knowing the mysteries that await me?
