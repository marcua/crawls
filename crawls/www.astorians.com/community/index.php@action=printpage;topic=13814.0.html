				http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28848679/?GT1=43001<br /><br />I think this story must be made up, because WHY would anyone get on the A train at 2am?&nbsp; Especially from the airport (most people would have luggage), and it&#039;s not like the subways run frequently at 2am, or are directly connected to the airport.&nbsp; If this guy is a famous actor, can&#039;t he afford a cab?&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve seen groups of MTA workers hanging around stations late at night.. that tends to be when a lot of the track work and cleaning gets done.
