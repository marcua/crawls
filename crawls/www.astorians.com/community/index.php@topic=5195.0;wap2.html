			I&#39;m not sure if I should post this here or not...<br /><br />but for the past couple of days when I open astorians.com from work the adobe 6 screen pops up (I have adobe 7 pro) and the site takes longer than usual to load. <br /><br />it&#39;s not a big deal but I wonder if anyone else has noticed it.

			I haven&#39;t had the same thing, but the last fiew times I open it, realplayer opens up with it...every single time...I&quot;m not sure what is going on...<br /><br />Today, I had a lot of issues opening the site.

			I don&#39;t think this is something going on server-side. I think it&#39;s possible that your browser is thinking that it&#39;s supposed to launch real when it hits the page. My browser at work does this with some sites as well. You may want to try coming to the site with www.astorians.com, or just astorians.com

			I have a problem with CLOSING the site.&nbsp; &nbsp;But then I don&#39;t think that&#39;s computer related as much as me having no willpower and being totally addicted to this joint.<br /><br />Can we have a thingy that refreshes the &quot;unread posts&quot; every few minutes?&nbsp; &nbsp; I&#39;m going thru mouse batteries like crazy clicking there all the time.&nbsp;

			Yeah, my IE7 says that &quot;this website wants to run the following add-on&quot; - Quicktime. I don&#39;t experience this with Firefox though...
