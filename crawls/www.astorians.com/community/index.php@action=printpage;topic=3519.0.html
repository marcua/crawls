				So I was walking home from the Astoria Blvd train station tonight around 1am, going across the elevated walkway with my friend, when a guy speeded by, weaving urgently through everybody as if going towards some big emergency, and I immediately saw that he had a gun in his right hand facing down. Then another guy followed suit, running by with a gun in his right hand too. <br /><br />Bizarre. I&#39;ve never seen handguns in plain sight like that before, held by people in plain clothes running by. Made me feel uncomfortable, and I held back so as not to be near guys with guns. <br /><br />Could they have been police in plain clothes? Or what else could it have been? Anyone hear anything? My friend said she&#39;d heard sirens right before we saw these guys run by us.

				Wow - that totally sucks. What makes it worse is that you couldn&#39;t even tell if they were police officers in disguise or regular citizens/criminals. Then again, not sure I&#39;d want to trust someone running with a gun no matter who they are since it sounds like an unsafe situation to begin with. Glad to know that you&#39;re safe at least!

				I&#39;ve been in the middle of police chases before (between the bad guys and the good guys) -- briefly -- and usually the cops pull out their badges and hang them around their necks.&nbsp; This probably assumes they&#39;ve had a moment to do that but police are usually fairly well identified.<br /><br />FYI.

				Good to know. Sounds like they may have been the bad guys in this situation then...although I still don&#39;t want to assume...

				I kinda think that if their guns were facing down, they were police officers.&nbsp; I kinda doubt criminals would make that effort.&nbsp; I think it&#39;s part of police training to learn about that kinda thing.&nbsp; But not really sure.

				Hey all - thanks for the kind messages. It&#39;s funny, I never felt all that unsafe, but definitely uncomfortable and unsure what to do seeing guns in plain sight like that without knowing for sure who these guys were. <br /><br />However, now I&#39;m pretty sure they were police officers. I agree with Jtrane, the fact that their guns were facing down, and also - the air about them was of responding to some emergency. Also I never really saw their fronts since they were zipping past us, so they could have had badges around their necks as jayme said, I just couldn&#39;t see them. Plus, they didn&#39;t really seem like criminals who would probably have been more reckless with people in their way. And lastly my friend later said that she saw the 2nd guy drop a pair of handcuffs when going down the stairs and he had to turn around and pick it up.<br /><br />So I felt better feeling sure they were police officers, though they didn&#39;t make us feel all that confident in the cops since the 2nd guy seemed a little discombobulated dropping his handcuffs and having someone else help him pick them up.<br /><br />A strange experience though - don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever been in the middle of a police chase before like jayme has! We should invest in one of those police scanners so we can find out what goes on around here. I&#39;m so curious what it was, and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll never find out!
