				This is the title of a very interesting article at ABC Radio National out of Australia.&nbsp; You can read the transcript or listen.&nbsp; The summary:&nbsp; <br /><br />&quot;A researcher in the United States claims that the reason for the obesity epidemic is more than just the calories we eat and the lack of exercise. It&#039;s a substance that food manufacturers are widely using.&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />The researcher is Dr. Robert Lustig at UCSF.&nbsp; &nbsp; This &quot;substance&quot; is high fructose corn syrup.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure we&#039;re all aware that HFCS is not good for you, and many of us have read numerous articles about HFCS in the food supply, but I liked the way they talked about it and presented the subject.&nbsp; My favorite quote: &quot;Fibre turns any food into a low glycaemic load food.&quot;<br /><br />There&#039;s a lot of medical/scientific jargon but it&#039;s still understandable.&nbsp; I hope you find the article helpful.<br /><br />http://www.abc.net.au/rn/healthreport/stories/2007/1969924.htm<br />[edited to add link!]

				This reminds me of the article I read this morning on the train in Mother Earth News which is thankfully online, too:<br /><br />http://www.motherearthnews.com/Livestock-and-Farming/2007-06-01/Growing-Trust.aspx<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Nobody should need science to prove the obvious, but plenty of studies do show that regularly eating cheaply produced fast food and processed snack foods slaps on extra pounds that increase the risks of diabetes, cardiovascular harm, joint problems and many cancers. As a country we’re officially over the top: the majority of our food dollars buy those cheap calories, and two-thirds of our citizens are medically compromised by weight. The incidence of obesity-associated diabetes has doubled since 1990, with children the fastest growing class of victims. One out of every $7 we spend on health care pays to assuage (but not cure) the multiple heartbreaks of diabetes — kidney failure, strokes, blindness, amputated limbs.<br /><br />An embarrassing but arguable point is that we’re applying deadly priorities to our food budgets because we believe the commercials. Industrial agriculture can promote its products on a supersized scale. Eighty percent of the beef-packing industry is controlled by four companies; the consolidation is exactly the same for soybean processing. With such vast corporate budgets weighing in on the side of beef and added fats, it’s no surprise that billions of dollars a year go into advertising fast food. The surprise is how handsomely marketers recoup that investment: how successfully they convince us that cheap food will make us happy, and maybe even thin.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				The mechanism for HFCS causing obesity (more than just sugar) is not yet clear, apparently. But they&#039;re narrowing down another obesity cause: plastic. Here&#039;s an article (http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/11/AR2007031100918_pf.html) from earlier this year about the very common plastic chemical bisphenol A, which mimics hormones in the body, and how it might damage fat cells in development and lead to obesity. Between the two, makes a Coke in a plastic bottle sound exceedingly appetizing!<br />
