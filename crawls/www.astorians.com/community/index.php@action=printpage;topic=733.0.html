				Can anyone recommend a great framing shop in our village or a nearby hamlet. &nbsp;I don't want to have to cross any bridges to get there.

				I'm sorry that I don't know the name of it (and I'm don't know where in Astoria you are) but I have taken several posters/pictures/diplomas in to get framed at the photo lab shop next to Blockbuster on Broadway (just east of Cresent). &nbsp;They have a nice selection of frames to choose from and they are about half the price of most Manhattan framers I've used. &nbsp;We've always had very good service with them, even with our picture developments and enlargements.

				There is a great little place on 30th Ave between 36th and 37th Street. &nbsp; They recently moved locations (across the street) and I believe its called Astoria Framers. &nbsp;They have a ton of selections and the guy who runs the office (I think his name is Pablo) was very careful with some of our sensitive/valuable prints. &nbsp; &nbsp;The rates were very reasonable and he gave us a discount because we had a lot done at once.

				i was hoping someone would post about the spot on 30th. &nbsp;I'm only a few blocks away so it's really convenient. &nbsp;It's good to hear you've had good luck there. &nbsp;I have a number of things to get done as well. &nbsp;Thanks. <br /><br />Jen

				My place on Broadway actually orders in all of their materials as needed for the customer, including the matting. &nbsp;I know that they cut the wood for the frames so I believe that they cut the matting themselves also...but I'm not 100% positive.
