			Take Root presents KaNu Dance Theater and Johnnie Cruise Mercer/TheREDProjectNYC <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;KaNu Dance Theater: An abstract but forward narrative about the fight for economic, social, class, and political justice in Haiti and how similar it is to what is currently going on here in the United States of America. Many people are sacrificing their lives every day in the fight for a better tomorrow in Haiti; but still not much has changed. Despite all that is happening around them Haiti and itsâ€™ people are still standing. The Human Spirit is on that is resilient.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Johnnie Cruise Mercer/TheREDProjectNYC: Johnnie Cruise Mercer/TheREDprojectNYC provides an in depth look at memories relation to reality. A Decade from Hell (quoted from TIME magazine) traces back to familiar times, quoting and sourcing American society between the years 2000-2010 to understand contemporary times and its relation to the past, the inevitable, and the future. Using director Johnnie Cruise Mercer&#039;s conscious memory as a launching point, the work engages subconscious memory in order to understand history&#039;s conscious motion of action and its connection to colonization of self. This work has been created while in residence at the 92Y Harkness Dance Center.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;May 12 &amp; 13, 2017 at 8pm<br />&nbsp;Admission: $15<br />&nbsp;Green Space Studio<br />&nbsp;37-24 24th Street, #301<br />&nbsp;Long Island City, NY 11101<br />&nbsp;718-956-3037<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Tickets are available at the door or online at http://www.greenspacestudio.org/TakeRoot.html<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Take Root is a monthly curated series that supports dance makers by providing an opportunity to show a half evening work paired with another artist.<br />
