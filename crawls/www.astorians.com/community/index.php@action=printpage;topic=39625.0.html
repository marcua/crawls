				I&#039;m not clear on what electronics can or cannot be thrown out. I know TVs, DVD/VCRs and Computers must be brought to electronics retailers, but what do you do about items such as steam irons, coffee makers, vacuum cleaners, and such? Can I throw them out with the trash?<br /><br />Also, what do you do with old TVs when you just want to throw them out, and the new one you purchased was from online merchant? Local retail stores won&#039;t want to take old TVs if you&#039;re not buying a new one from them, right?

				Thanks, I had seen that site. It appears the Queens drop off site for electronics is all the way out in College Point. Since the electronic items I mentioned on not listed, I want to be sure I&#039;m doing the right thing by throwing them out with the trash.

				This new law really makes it hard for someone who can&#039;t lift heavy things and who doesn&#039;t have a car to get rid of big things such as tvs and also old computers.&nbsp; There should be an easier way.&nbsp; There&#039;s no way I could lift my heavy old tv so I just keep it and also my old computer

				The main reason I started this thread on electronics disposal is that when I previously attempted to throw out small appliances they were not picked up. So I assumed I was doing something wrong. After reading the answers here, I attempted disposal again of the same tiems, and this time they took them.

				Regarding old televisions, it appears electronic stores that sell them don&#039;t want to take them.&nbsp; <br /><br />PC Richards refuses to take my old TV. I went there with the intention of buying a new television, but they have a policy of not taking the old one. I don&#039;t know the law but I thought electronic stores that sell TV&#039;s are required to accept the old ones. I left without doing business with them. As a long time customer who has purchased a lot of items from them, I find their refusal to take back the old TV a serious disconnect with the community they want to do business with. <br /><br />As for Best Buy they are willing to accept your old TV if you pay $25 charge. Both stores appear to not comply with NYC law to take back old TVs without a fee.

				<br />I didn&#039;t read every response here but... please, please.... if you have any type of appliance or electronics that you no longer want, and which the city will not accept, or you don&#039;t have the ability to drop off somewhere.... please try to recycle the item.&nbsp; Many people want such items, whether in working condition or not.&nbsp; (Some people like to tinker with things and try to &#039;fix them&#039;.&nbsp; Other people want the items for their parts.)<br /><br />Our landfills are obviously FULL of &#039;stuff&#039;.&nbsp; Please do what you can do add less to our landfills.<br /><br />Post a note on Craiglist Classifieds in the FREE section offering up the items.&nbsp; You can also just say CURB ALERT in the header, and indicate that &#039;the following items will be on the curb in front of address such and such&#039;.&nbsp; Then it&#039;s up to folks to come by for it.<br /><br />https://newyork.craigslist.org/search/zip<br /><br />Or post on Freecycle.org.&nbsp; Freecyle and TrashNothing are somehow related I think, and considered a Yahoo Group.&nbsp; I DO recall it was a bit confusing first setting up an account, but once I was setup the process was super easy.&nbsp; Folks OFFER stuff on the site, or indicate stuff they WANT, and people find each other that way.<br /><br />https://www.freecycle.org/<br /><br />

				Also consider the Lower East Side Ecology Center, (https://www.lesecologycenter.org/) located in Brooklyn (despite the name.) They have occasional “recycling events” at various locations, see this schedule (https://www.lesecologycenter.org/calendar/category/ewaste/ewaste-events/).
