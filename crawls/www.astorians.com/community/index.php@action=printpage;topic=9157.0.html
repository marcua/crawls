				Title: <strong>Manning makes it to next round of playoff. No, the other Manning.</strong><br />

				What a great game the Giants had last night. They&#039;re one of the few teams in NFL history to beat two teams on the road in a row during the playoffs. If they can pull it together and send old man Favre packing, they&#039;ll be (I&#039;m pretty sure) the first team in NFL history to win three road games in the post season.<br /><br />Also, I could not believe the holding call on the Chargers during the second quarter. I watched the play over and over again (thank god for DVR) and for the life of me could not find the hold. None of the sports casters could find it during the half time shows either. What a load. It was arguably the worst referee call that I have ever seen. I&#039;m sure the Monday &quot;sorry for the penalty&quot; letter will be nice, but that almost cost them the game. Great to see the Chargers rally against Indy.<br /><br />Congrats, Eli, you&#039;re finally on your way out of your brother&#039;s shadow. And Peyton, you better buy some bigger shirts.

				1) The Giants won&#039;t beat the Packers at Lambeau.&nbsp; <br />2) The calls against the Chargers were some of the worst I&#039;ve ever seen, ever.<br />3) The Chargers / Pats game next week is going to be awesome, if the Chargers aren&#039;t as beat up as they looked at the end of yesterday&#039;s game.

I&#039;ve read some articles with Favre making comments about how no one will ever catch up to the records he&#039;s setting now and the bottom line is that it&#039;s just plain untrue--if Brady&#039;s career lasts as long as Favre&#039;s, he should, by all rights, catch up. Of course, now I can&#039;t find the article because every single sports article published in the last 24 hours contains the words &quot;Tom Brad&quot; + &quot;Brett Favre&quot; + &quot;Records&quot;.
