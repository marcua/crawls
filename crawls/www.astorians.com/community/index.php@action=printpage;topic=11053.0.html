				I&#039;m due to go see an endocrinologist for possible hyperactive thyroid problems in August, but really have no idea what to expect or even if the person I am going to go see is good (seems good based upon her online resume). She appears to focused primarily on obesity issues, so I have no idea if that bodes well for me or not, or if it doesn&#039;t really matter since she calls herself an endocrinologist.<br /><br />Anyway, since my appointment is a couple of months off I figured I&#039;d check in with the group to see if any of you have a good endocrinologist to recommend or stories to share.

				Wasabi, I&#039;ve had my own thyroid issues, though not hyperthyroidism. I&#039;m very happy with the endocrinologist I&#039;m seeing now, Dr. Katz (http://www.nyp.org/FPHTML/1168360089075.html). <br /><br />All endocrinologists are not created equally. The range of normal for TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone, which is what they generally test when a thryoid disorder is suspected) is currently under debate, and whether other tests such as T3 and T4 should be part of the diagnostic tests is also a hot topic. <br /><br />The bottom line is, if you feel like crap and all your doctor is telling you is that the numbers say you are perfectly healthy, get a second opinion, a third, and a fourth until you find someone who pays as much attention to your symptoms as they do to the test results. <br /><br />Best of luck, and feel free to PM me for more thyroid chatter :) <br /><br />

				Thanks guys (and everybody who PM&#039;d me). Haven&#039;t had a chance to respond to your very helpful posts until now.<br /><br />BigBryan, I&#039;ll PM you momentarily with the name of the doc.<br /><br />My thing is that I want to make sure that I find a doctor that will definitely pay attention to me, talk with me in depth about my symptoms (and I&#039;ve got a bit of a list), and give me good advice. Really, I would like a holistic approach where I&#039;m not getting cookie cutter recommendations/advice.<br /><br />It&#039;s not that I distrust the doc I am set to go see, but the fact that her &quot;about&quot; page doesn&#039;t mention the word &quot;thyroid&quot; once is kind of irritating to me, and makes me think I might get a more cookie cutter approach from her. She may be great (and she looks like a nice person from her picture, which is a bonus), but would like to evaluate my options.<br /><br />Anyway, off to research more doctors.

				I feel your pain, because recently I had to look for another endocrinologist.&nbsp; My endocrinologist here in Astoria moved away, and I&#039;m limited to those doctors who take Blue Cross-Blue Shield.&nbsp; There was only one such endocrinologist in Astoria last time I checked.<br /><br />You&#039;ll probably have to go to the city.&nbsp; Most of the endocrinologists seem to be in group practices in Manhattan.

				Yeah, per my insurance I have to get the referral from my PCP - which is not the doctor I got my original referral from. So now I am going to my PCP and he&#039;s running tests first, then plans to sit down with me next week and refer me to someone.<br /><br />It&#039;s such a hassle, and I&#039;m not fond of going to the doctor, but when you get to a point where you&#039;re actually physically miserable it&#039;s pretty much time time to bite the bullet and just do it. So far it hasn&#039;t been too bad, but will be nice when I&#039;ve been officially diagnosed and know what I need to do.<br /><br />On a side note, I am wondering if not eating iodized salt on a regular basis can truly cause thyroid problems? I have been using a gourmet, natural salt for at least a couple of years now and so my iodized salt intake has been lower than the average person. Anybody know anything about this? I just realized the other day that this could potentially be my problem.

				Here (http://www.med.umich.edu/1libr/aha/umioddef.htm) is a list of symptoms of iodine deficiency.&nbsp; It generally would cause <em>hypo</em>thyroidism rather than <em>hyper</em>thyroidism, though.&nbsp; Besides iodized salt (which I don&#039;t use either), I think the most common sources of iodine are animal-based (mostly seafood and dairy), so you may need to take an iodine supplement (or eat a lot of kelp) on a vegan diet.&nbsp; Here (http://www.veganoutreach.org/health/stayinghealthy.html#iodine) and here (http://www.veganhealth.org/articles/iodine) is specific information about iodine supplementing on a vegan diet - they note that in Europe, where salt is not iodized, many vegans show signs of abnormal thyroid function.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know how much soy you eat, but the second link notes that &quot;large amounts of soy combined with inadequate iodine intake can exacerbate iodine deficiency.&quot;

My soy intake is definitely high, probably too high (but it&#039;s tasty...what can I say?). When I asked my PCP if it was related to diet, especially since more recently I&#039;ve been vegan (for about 3 years), he said that it is an autoimmune disorder, and really has nothing to do with diet. It&#039;s likely that I may get more specific insight from an endocrinologist as my doctor is an internist and doesn&#039;t have as much experience with hyperthyroidism. I&#039;m of the mind that diet does have a big influence over how your body operates, so wouldn&#039;t be surprised if an endocrinologist or a dietitian would point out some things I should be doing differently.

				depending on the salt you are using, you may still be getting iodine even if it&#039;s not &quot;iodized&quot; salt. <br /><br />if it&#039;s sea salt, it&#039;s got iodine - though I don&#039;t know how much, I only know I absolutely couldn&#039;t have it when I was on the low-iodine diet.&nbsp;
