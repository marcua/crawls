				Experienced Drummer and Bassist ready to get a band going. We need some VOX/Lead Guitar(s) and anything else. Funky, Hippie Rock, Jam oriented sound. Definitely need some strong VOX in a musician. Bassist can sing lead on some songs and backup on all others. <br /><br />Look, we have been on the road, stayed in cheap hotels and slept in a van. That was 10 years ago. We are in our early 30&#039;s now, and we are looking to get music going again and find its place in our lives. Rehearse once a week (maybe twice), with the intention of playing monthly gigs. Don&#039;t let any of this fool you though, we are obsessed, dedicated musicians. We have done mostly originals our whole careers, but here&#039;s the covers we&#039;ve been jamming on right now (Grateful Dead, Phish, Allmans, etc)...please use the following song lost as a measurement of the type of musicians we are and what we&#039;re looking for : <br /><br />Cream Puff War (Grateful Dead) <br />Cryptical Envelopment &gt; The Other One (Grateful Dead) <br />The Eleven (Grateful Dead) <br />Salin&#039; Cross the Devils Seas (Allman Brothers) <br />Axilla (Phish) <br />Woflman&#039;s Brother (Phish) <br />Fee (Phish) <br />Julius (Phish) <br />Mike&#039;s Song (Phish) <br />Horn (Phish) <br /><br />Plus a Few Original Tunes from back in the day as well. (If you have any as well, bring &#039;em)<br /><br />Let us know!!! We rehearse at Astoria Soundworks right now, with the occasional excursion out to the drummer&#039;s house in LI. If you want to get together and jam towards a goal, let us know. <br /><br />PM me if you are interested. <br />Peace out.
