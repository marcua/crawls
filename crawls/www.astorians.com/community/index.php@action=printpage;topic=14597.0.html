				I just passed by the old Thessaloniki Pastries on 31st Avenue and 34th Street; there&#039;s plywood on the outside and a sign saying &quot;Bare Burgers&quot; is coming.&nbsp; Apparently, they&#039;re going to be offering organic burgers, shakes, etc.

				I came on looking for some gossip on this. I walked by the other week while doing laundry and spoke to one of the owners (I think) who said they&#039;re getting licenses together and it should be about 1 more month. Organic beers, grass-fed burgers and other crazy burgers--like ostrich he mentioned.<br /><br />Anyone else have any news? They&#039;re just east of Himalayan Tea House where that old sketchy Greek bakery used to be.

				Oh fantastic! Walked in last weekend and really loved all the cleverly reused materials and beautifully designed space. Prices didn&#039;t seem too crazy, but we&#039;ll have to wait and see what the portions and quality are like. I&#039;m dying to try a shake, too. Oh, and owner said they&#039;ll be delivering.

				Checked it out yesterday.&nbsp; My group had the beef, elk and bison burgers.&nbsp; Overall everyone enjoyed and had a good experience. Here are the only drawbacks in my opinion: <br /><br />a) They currently only take cash (credit card machine wasn&#039;t working yet).&nbsp; This obviously will be fixed but we weren&#039;t informed until the end of our meal and had to walk over to the ATM.<br /><br />b) At least on the Bison burgers, the buns seemed to dominate the sandwich and are too big in relation to the patty<br /><br />c) Thought they overcooked the bison/beef from what we ordered, I&#039;ll write this off to busy and opening night<br /><br />d) I personally think their price point is a bit too high.&nbsp; As a pro-organic consumer, I understand that their is a premium for organic ingredients but $15 for a bison burger and fries seems a little much.<br /><br /><br />All things considered, I will be back.&nbsp; They also plan on serving beer once they get their liquor licence.

				My wife and I went yesterday as well.&nbsp; We were really excited for this place to open as there aren&#039;t too many restaurants in the neighborhood that focus on organic ingredients.&nbsp; All in all we both really liked the place and will definitely go back.<br /><br />We got there about 5pm yesterday and the place was packed.&nbsp; We got the last table and there was even a small line for to go orders.&nbsp; I am sure that the owners were very happy with the opening - i can&#039;t imagine how excited/nervous small business owners must be when they first open the doors - but they seemed slightly overwhelmed by the amount of people.&nbsp; They only had one wait-person for the floor and she was running all over taking orders - she did a good job under the circumstances.&nbsp; It took a little while to order but this was obviously due to just opening and I suspect it will be sorted out. On the other hand they seemed to have enough people behind the counter and at the grill. Once we ordered we did not have to wait very long for our milkshake and then food. A couple of the people behind the counters were running food out to the tables which helped out a lot. The staff was very friendly and attentive. Several people came over to our table during the course of our meal to see if everything was okay.<br /><br />They obviously put a lot of time and energy into the atmosphere: garage door walls, metal chairs, cool light fixtures with forks and bar glasses hanging from them and funky green high back booths.&nbsp; It seems like they have plenty of space for an outdoor seating area if they need it and if they can get the required cafe license.&nbsp; The atmosphere was very fun and almost celebratory with a lot of energy.<br /><br />We ordered an original beef cheeseburger with fries, a California Burger (topped with avocado, onion and tomato) with onion rings, a peanut butter chocolate milkshake and an iced tea.&nbsp; We liked the Original Burger much more than the California and the onion rings and the milkshake were excellent. <br /><br />The Original Burger comes with there signature special sauce which seemed like it was a bbq mayo.&nbsp; It had a subtle smokey flavor that did not overwhelm the rest of the burger.&nbsp; It was a great compliment to the other condiments - jack cheese, lettuce, tomato and red onion. We both thought the Original Burger was very good with some issues with the actual burger patty (see below).<br /><br />We ordered the California burger with beef - they suggest the veggie burger.&nbsp; We found this one a little on the bland side but maybe it is better with the veggie burger. We thought that the avocado needed a little something more - salt, pepper, and/or mayo.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />We ordered both burgers medium as suggested by the waitress. The flavor of the beef was good and the beef patties are handmade which is nice. As m_bart said above, the burgers came out a little overcooked -maybe medium well with very little pink- and pretty dry.&nbsp; I would suggest ordering the burger medium rare.&nbsp; I am not positive but I think they use a fairly lean mix of beef that is finely ground.&nbsp; I would like to see a little fattier mix with more juice - especially when they have other lean options on the menu like bison and elk.&nbsp; On the other hand, the burgers both had a really nice charred crust that added a nice grilled flavor and good texture.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Peanut Butter milkshake was excellent and tasted very fresh.&nbsp; The milkshake tasted homemade and not from a mix.&nbsp; The ice tea was excellent as well.&nbsp; It was light, refreshing and slightly sweet.<br /><br />The onion rings were also another standout and probably the best single item we had.&nbsp; The rings were crisp on the outside with juicy soft onions on the inside.&nbsp; They had a really nice think crunchy covering.&nbsp; I thought the fries were okay but I have to admit that I am usually not a big fan of the fresh cut fries as they often come out too dark for my liking.&nbsp; To Bareburgers credit, they seemed a little better than the fresh cut/dark fries I have had in the past.<br /><br />As m_bart said above, the place is definitely on the pricey side. It was about $50 for two burgers, two sides, milkshake, drink and tip. Unfortunately for us the price puts Bareburger into the occasional category - maybe 4 or 5 times a year. It is nice, however, to support a restaurant that focuses on the environment with quality ingredients and a fun atmosphere.&nbsp; I hope they do some sort of a discount on weekday nights.&nbsp; Maybe a two for tuesday - two burgers for the price of one - or possibly $1 sides, something like that. <br /><br />All in all I highly recommend this restaurant as a fun burger joint with cool decor, quality food and friendly staff.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I went in yesterday (6/13) after weeks of being excited for a burger place to open just two blocks from me (I&#039;m a burger fiend)<br /><br />I had just eaten a burger earlier that day so I went to take in the atmosphere and have a root beer and the Panda Meal (chicken dish)<br /><br />They&#039;re obviously just getting used to things there as our waitress was a little absent minded and forgot to bring my friend the water he asked for. He had also ordered a milkshake (pistachio) and she brought it in the metal mixer cup along with a glass but didn&#039;t pour it. Maybe they don&#039;t do that there. Maybe she was busy. But whenever I&#039;ve gotten a milkshake at a place they pour the metal cup mix in the glass and leave the dregs for you to finish off.<br /><br />The fries were pretty undercooked too.<br /><br />I still got high hopes and expect them to get better in the coming weeks. Maybe next time I&#039;ll try a burger. :)

				I tried it for lunch and was very pleased.&nbsp; The atmosphere is great--corner place with windows on two walls, nicely designed.&nbsp; They got my order slightly wrong but were prompt and cheerful about fixing it, so no worries.&nbsp; The elk kind of tasted like a cross between venison and beef; I&#039;d been hoping for a radically different flavor but that&#039;s not the restaurant&#039;s fault; I&#039;m glad there&#039;s a place in Astoria where I can get ostrich burgers (if you haven&#039;t tried them, try them).&nbsp; <br /><br />The fries are awesome--they&#039;re thin, which isn&#039;t my favorite, but they&#039;re skin-on and have sort of the consistency of English chips.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if they boil them before frying like chips, but whatever they do, the results are spectacular.&nbsp; Though the bun is kind of bulky (I got the seven-grain), I didn&#039;t think it was out of control.<br /><br />

				I picked up an order to go last night.&nbsp; I had the original burger, with onion rings and a peanut butter chocolate shake.&nbsp; Overall, I&#039;d give them a 7 out of 10.&nbsp; The burger on its brioche bun was tasty, but I have to say that I couldn&#039;t taste the pepper jack cheese at all.&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing it&#039;s because it looks like they put a very, very thin slice on the burger.&nbsp; This is shame because if you&#039;re using pepper jack, one would expect a bit of added flavor to the burger.&nbsp; &nbsp;The onion rings were awesomely good, but for $4 I expected more than 5 rings of varying size.&nbsp; Also, while very tasty, the shake is rather small for it&#039;s $5.95 price and in consistency it was more like a smoothie than a shake.&nbsp; I was looking forward to a nice thick creamy shake.&nbsp; So, for $20.40 in total, I&#039;d say there are lot of areas needing improvement.&nbsp;

				I got the jalepeno express elk burger wrapped in lettuce w/fries, and although it was tasty, $15 is way too much. The fries serving was very modest. We got it to go and it was ready very quickly though. I know it&#039;s organic and everything, but I hope they lower their prices a tad.

				Generally agree with&nbsp; most of the comments so far.&nbsp; Went on Sunday for an early dinner (around 5pm) and tried to be very understanding of the place just opening and expected there to be some things that they would need to work out or not have yet (for instance, beer?&nbsp; Anyone know if they&#039;ll be getting a liquor license? There appears to be a place for taps.)&nbsp; While the food was, frankly, pretty average I think the concept is still great, the atmosphere is good, and there is a lot of variety and potential for the place.&nbsp; <br /><br />The most notable downside was the service.&nbsp; As a former server, there is NO WAY an inexperienced server could handle on their own that number of tables once they were all full (which they were.)&nbsp; I felt terrible for the poor girl that they had running around as this was clearly her first time waiting tables and she was struggling.&nbsp; And I certainly didn&#039;t feel like this was entirely her fault.&nbsp; The electronic ordering is a good idea in concept but in actuality there seemed to be a lot of problems with it - for instance we decided on a minor order addition about 30 seconds after she hit send on the machine and couldn&#039;t get this relatively easy change made because of their computerized order placing system.&nbsp; The change we wanted to make was shrugged off by the girl who was supervising the server who said we&#039;d &quot;have to try it next time.&quot;&nbsp; I think what really bothered me was that this more &quot;experienced&quot; girl who was training the main server really wasn&#039;t a help at all.&nbsp; We had to ask her for water.&nbsp; Twice!&nbsp; We also had to seat ourselves and get our own menus.&nbsp; Also it would&#039;ve been nice if someone mentioned that they did not take credit cards yet before we got our bill.&nbsp; A friend who went Sunday night after I was there also mentioned they ran out of the brioche buns and weren&#039;t informed of it until they tried to place their order.<br /><br />The burgers didn&#039;t wow me for a burger place - overcooked, pretty small in size/overwhelmed by the bun - but I would be willing to give the food a second chance... except I&#039;d get take-out this time!<br /><br />Walked by last night and they were packed which is remarkable in this economy for a new place in the middle of the week.&nbsp; I&#039;ll be curious to see if they can shake off these issues.&nbsp; One of the things that I think is so great about Astoria dining is the high level of service that you get and here Bare Burger was a serious miss.

				So it&#039;s a full sit-down kind of place?&nbsp; I was expecting it to be along the lines of Petey&#039;s, where you place your order at a counter.&nbsp; And why does <span class="bbc_u">every</span> burger option have cheese on it?&nbsp; I dislike cheeseburgers immensely and hope they let you have just a regular burger.

				You can definitely get it without the cheese, as my fiance did, but yeah it sucks that you essentially still have to pay for it.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also, the cheese slice is so little and thin that you don&#039;t even taste the cheese, which is a shame.&nbsp; I&#039;m a big cheeseburger fan. <br /><br />Yeah, the place is set-up very similar to Petey&#039;s - that is, big&nbsp; cash register counter with poster size menus on the wall above.&nbsp; So, it really looks like you should order up there and grab the burger when it&#039;s ready or have it brought to you.&nbsp; Having the wait service is stupid, IMO.&nbsp; It&#039;s an unnecessary added cost.&nbsp; &nbsp;Hopefully they will do away with the waiter service.

				I finally got to try the place yesterday, it was packed and waited a few minutes for a table. If you want to eat there, you need to order with a server, they had 2 yesterday.<br /><br />The food was awesome imo, I love burgers and the place hit the spot. The service, errr... lacks a bit for sure. I had a tall skinny girl as my waitress, she fudged up the order, no big deal to me since I was a waiter myself for 4 years, but when i mentioned it, she had a pretty snotty attitude. Whatever, i&#039;m not there to argue with anyone, just my obversation, i tipped properly as usual, but with regrets of doing so.<br /><br />My thoughts, great for take out, not so great for sitting in. Also it is a bit on the pricey side for what it is, $40 for 2 of us, 2 burgers with fries no drink (tip included)

				My husband and I stopped by Bareburger late this afternoon around 2:30pm.&nbsp; Looks like they are doing pretty well -- tables were almost full for a late Friday afternoon.&nbsp; &nbsp;We ordered to go.&nbsp; &nbsp;I got a their basic beef burger with jack cheese on a 7 grain bun.&nbsp; My husband wasn&#039;t going to get anything because he&#039;s watching his carbs, but then we noticed that we could get a burger wrapped in iceberg lettuce.&nbsp; &nbsp; He ended up getting an ostrich burger wrapped in lettuce.&nbsp; &nbsp;We both really enjoyed our burgers. My husband said they got the temperature on his burger exactly right (medium rare).&nbsp; &nbsp;And my burger had this great sauce on it and just the right amount of lettuce tomato and onion.&nbsp; &nbsp;My burger was about $9 and the ostrich burger was about $11 -- all in all we thought this was a reasonable price for the quality and will definitely be back for more.

				My BF and I finally tried BB this past week.&nbsp; I had the bacon cheeseburger with beef and he had the same but no cheese and he chose bison.&nbsp; We both ordered our burgers medium and both received overcooked burgers.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t send it back because I hate wasting food but next time I will send it back - I hear they&#039;re having a problem with that.<br /><br />Honestly, I don&#039;t know why people are up in arms about the price.&nbsp; I thought $9 for a burger that&#039;s made from organic meat is a fare price.&nbsp; If you add on the fries and everything comes to $15 - I&#039;ve been to plenty of places that charge that for a regular conventionally-farmed burger.&nbsp; Plus, where else in NY can you get an organic elk burger around the corner?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I didn&#039;t think it was as good as I had hoped it would be.&nbsp; I will try them again and beg them not to over-cook the meat next time.<br /><br />Lastly, they really have to get a liquor license - or at least some sort of temp permit so we can bring our own.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know about you, but I love burgers and beer - organic root beer doesn&#039;t cut it.<br /><br />and, in response to the baby question:&nbsp; I get really uptight about babies in nice restaurants but this is a casual burger joint, anything goes.

				Went Saturday afternoon and had the lamb burger (this one doesn&#039;t have cheese on it). Before I ordered, I asked our very gracious and friendly waitress, how many ounces the burger was. She said 8 oz. Ok, now because I&#039;m always weighing my food, there is no way that was an 8oz. burger, it was more like 4-6; 8 maybe if you include the bun, toppings, etc! Ha. I asked for medium and my husband, who got their signature bareburger, asked for rare. Both of ours came out well done. My lamb was very tasty and very very lean, not what I was expecting, but still good. Would I order it again? Probably not unless I really tell them to watch the cooking on it. My husband&#039;s burger probably had a bit more fat on it and it was really good. We didn&#039;t order any extras like fries, onion rings or shakes, so our bill for two burgers was $23. Not exactly cheap for burgers, even organic burgers. At this price point, I&#039;d throw in the damn fries.

				Agreed.&nbsp; I think $4 for fries or onion rings is a bit much, especially considering that with the onion rings I literally received 5 rings of varying size.&nbsp; And with the fries, I was hoping the portion would be big enough to share with my guy.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; It won&#039;t keep me from going there, but it will keep me from going as often.&nbsp; And while I will (and have) recommended the place to my friends, I have told them about the price, portion and cooking issues.

				mcgowan, I don&#039;t want to belabor this point because I probably won&#039;t be going there very frequently. BUT, I do cook on a regular basis and I know that ground and cooked will weigh differently. Setting aside for now whether she answered me in oz for ground or cooked, at the most, the difference would have been 1 oz, not 2. If we give her the benefit of the doubt and say the burger was 6 oz instead of what it looked like to me, more like 4-5, then that&#039;s a lot of juice and fat that left that little burger! I don&#039;t expect her to know this, but I thought it was conveniently not advertised off of the take out menu. (Didn&#039;t see the regular menu.) Most places, burger, diners, and restaurants list what their burger size is; it&#039;s a matter of pride to advertise the size. If it actually had fat in it, then I could expect there to be a bigger difference between the ground and cooked, but like I said, the meat was really really lean, very little juice to speak of. I don&#039;t begrudge them the restaurant. I think it&#039;s gorgeous, has a very hip vibe, close to another good restaurant, is very family/baby friendly (there were 3 babies and 2 kids in the restaurant when I ate there) It uses recycled material, organic food, etc... BUT, in this economy (and frankly in any), I can&#039;t understand the stinginess of separating all the things you&#039;d get in a typical burger place and charging too much for all of those extras. I love eating out as much as the next person, but this place right now with what it&#039;s offering, is great when someone else is picking up the tab. For the same price of $12, I&#039;ll be going back to Brick when I want a real burger that I can&#039;t make myself at home, and it will come with fries.

				I went there on Sunday for takeout as my apartment is a 1/2 block away. The place was busy which I was happy to see and I had already been just to try out a shake. I had the chocolate peanut butter and it was very good.<br /><br />I ordered a medium Bison Bacon Cheeseburger and fries. After taking the burger home I discovered the inside was not cooked at all - it was basically the ground meat. I like my meat medium rare usually but this was inedible so I packed my dinner back up and took it back to Bareburger where they cooked it a bit more and gave me fresh fries(without me asking). My roommate later asked why I just didn&#039;t cook the burger more myself.<br /><br />The burger was good and the fries were as well. I would give it another shot but I have a hard time paying these high prices when I could get a good burger elsewhere cheaper. The organic-ness of it all is def a draw so I will give it another shot.<br /><br />Also staff was very nice and accomodating.

				My original feeling after visiting Bareburger was that they were definitely worth another shot.&nbsp; Let them work out the kinks of being a new restaurant, figure out the service issues, etc.&nbsp; But, honestly, the more I&#039;ve thought about it the more I&#039;ve realized that the burgers I&#039;ve had at the diners in the area (like the one in the shopping plaza on Broadway at 21st) have always been way better than what I had at Bareburger.&nbsp; There are too many other great, locally owned, reasonably priced places to dine with awesome food and outstanding service in Astoria.&nbsp; I won&#039;t bother with Bareburger again.&nbsp; I was REALLY excited to see this place open and am still disappointed with my experience there.

				was at BareBurger on a Monday night.&nbsp; Wasn&#039;t that crowded - they seemed to be making an effort on the service which addresses some of the prior commentary - although again it wasn&#039;t a full crowd.<br />Had the Jalapeno Burger (piedmontese beef) and the ranch swiss burger (bison) - both ordered medium with fries and onion rings.<br />The 7 grain bun was a definite winner but as for the burgers - they came out slightly overdone - (although quickly) - and were a little disappointing overall.&nbsp; The Jalapeno burger wasn&#039;t very spicy for some reason and the beef while good was a little overcooked to really tell.&nbsp; Liked the Swiss burger (bison) better - thought the meat was leaner and more flavorful.&nbsp; As for the fries - kinda weak - overcooked again - and generally not flavorful - and the onion rings were burnt to a crisp making them almost inedible.<br /><br />Still not a terrible experience but not one that I&#039;m in a rush to try again for $20 a head (w/tip).&nbsp; If the prices came down I&#039;d be willing to try them a few more times - in the meantime - I&#039;ll wait for better reviews.

				I tried the new burger place out Saturday afternoon and kind of agree what others said.&nbsp; &nbsp;I felt my burger was a tad overcooked, but not bad.&nbsp; &nbsp;The fries were out of this world, though, and they were the best part of the meal.&nbsp; &nbsp;I tried the organic cola and they gave me a refill on the house, which was nice.&nbsp; &nbsp;Service was très excellent.&nbsp; &nbsp; I was full after my meal and declined to order the milk shake, which sounded delicious.&nbsp; &nbsp;I agree about the prices, over $18 with tip.&nbsp; &nbsp;I would go back.

				Just tried Bareburger for the first time tonight.&nbsp; Got their primary Bareburger #1 to go.&nbsp; Overall, the only complaint I had was waiting a little over half an hour for take out.&nbsp; (Not necessarily their fault - they got an onslaught of dine-in, take-out and delivery orders literally at the same time.&nbsp; People seated right around the time I ordered still hadn&#039;t received their food when I left.)&nbsp; I got an apology twice from a goateed guy in a more beige shirt who works there.&nbsp; Told me the delay was due to hold-ups in the kitchen.&nbsp; I looked back and saw about 10-12 slips hanging, and with that small space they have, could imagine the chaos.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyways, my burger and fries were hot and fresh - so they certainly weren&#039;t sitting in spite of the long wait.&nbsp; The burger - pretty good - could definitely make a run for the best in Astoria.&nbsp; This place is definitely tops for designer burgers, with all their meat and topping options.&nbsp; The fries - simply unbelievable!&nbsp; They need to get their liquor license in tow to deliver on the beers part of their tag line.&nbsp; Overall, would I go back, yes! (Will bring a friend from Sunnyside there soon.)&nbsp; Though, at $11.95 and up for a burger and fries, it won&#039;t necessarily be a regular choice (certainly better burger deals can be found in this hood, though the portion sizes at Bareburger are plentiful to go along with their top quality ingredients).<br /><br />Overall, I liken this to an Astoria/Queens version of Rare and several of the other upscale, designer burger spots that have popped up in Manhattan in these past few years.&nbsp; Next is to measure this up against Donovan&#039;s in Woodside, which to my knowledge, is the most talked about burger spot in the borough.&nbsp; This place still has some service and capacity kinks to work out with the kitchen, but provided that gets dealt with in time, looks like we have a new neighborhood spot.

				So, we had the take out again last night.&nbsp; I&#039;m happy to say that it looks like they&#039;re taking some of the suggestions to heart.&nbsp; First off, they have an email sign-up sheet near the register for coupons/specials and they say on the sheet that they welcome feedback.&nbsp; And our meals were better than before.&nbsp; Our burgers were just as tasty but even bigger than before.&nbsp; Also, I told them that we&#039;d be sharing a side order of fries, so this time we got a huge container or them instead of the burger size container.&nbsp; <br /><br />We were quite happy with our meals and we&#039;re now always coming here for our burger fix.

				Made it over to BareBurger last week, and ended up being impressed.&nbsp; I had the (very good) veggie burger, and my mates had a beef burger and an ostrich burger.&nbsp; They both were happy with theirs, too.&nbsp; Good milkshake and fries too.<br /><br />I noticed that they now have a bottle of Annie&#039;s organic ketchup on each table.&nbsp; The service seemed to be very conscious and focused on making everyone feel welcome and attended too.&nbsp; I think they&#039;ve been working to keep upgrading, maybe even reading this site to take some hints.

				Went for the second time this weekend hoping they would cook our burgers right now that they&#039;ve been open awhile.<br /><br />They didn&#039;t.<br /><br />I want to support this place because it&#039;s adorable and because I believe in what they do and because they&#039;re nice.&nbsp; But they ruined our burgers both times by overcooking them.&nbsp; <br /><br />BAREBURGER:&nbsp; WHEN YOUR PATRONS ASK FOR MEDIUM RARE PLEASE COOK THE BURGERS MEDIUM RARE.<br /><br />I&#039;ve now blown $60 on ruined organic meat.&nbsp; If they won&#039;t cook the burgers to order because of the supposed microbe risk then they should state that on their menus.

				I&#039;m with Geoworld. I gave BB a 2nd chance 2 weeks back and got their original burger this time and asked for medium. The waitress looked at me funny and I said, &quot;Because they didn&#039;t cook it right the last time, I mean medium.&quot; She said, &quot;You know that&#039;s going to be pink inside.&quot; Really?&nbsp; :-o<br /><br />Anyway, the fries that we got ended up being a good deal because they were an enormous portion-we got the basket for $5, but I would have preferred to get a 1/4 of this, really easily split among 4 people even if you&#039;re hungry. I love any kind of fry, so I liked these, too. Do they offer less than the basket size?<br /><br />So, my burger, at least half of it, came out medium and I was happy, then I got to the other half of the burger and it was raw. I don&#039;t mean pink or slightly cooked, it was RAW! How does this even happen—are they frozen and defrosted? I don&#039;t get it. Very frustrating. I can see this becoming one of those co-dependent relationships, where I want to give Bare Burger another chance because they&#039;re cute and funny and are trying so hard to be part of the local, organic blah blah movement, but each time I go back, I&#039;m disappointed. :-( They should offer counseling in that bar section.

				Have to say, just went today for the first time and it looks like they must have read the criticisms on here and taken it to heart. <br /><br />And it may have been the best burger I&#039;ve ever had. EVER. <br /><br />Definitely better than all burgers I&#039;ve had in Astoria, including the Sparrow (and Sparrow I love you you will always be my first love)<br /><br />First of all the patty of beef was flavorful... I cannot remember the last time I have had a burger where the beef was actually seasoned, not just thrown on the grill. All the fixins were in perfect proportion to the amount of meat, which was generous. I am full, but not stuffed to the gills which is a good feeling. Really liked the special sauce on it also.<br /><br />The bun was perfect (brioche), it stayed together with almost no sogginess during the entire meal, and I felt it was a great balance of smushy breadness and crusty crunch.<br /><br />As for the done-ness of the meat, I ordered medium rare and that was done perfectly as well, brown on the outside with about a 1/4 inch of nice juicy pink stuff in the middle. <br /><br />It&#039;s gonna be hard not to go back every day ;)

				I&#039;ll have to give Bareburger&#039;s shakes another try. I had their peanutbutter chocolate shake the first week it opened.&nbsp; I was very disappointed because it was both tiny for the price (although, good for the waistline) and very thin/melted.&nbsp; However, their burgers and fries have definitely improved since then so I&#039;m guessing the shakes have as well.

				We finally got around to trying it and we were both really disappointed.<br /><br />I got the original, no cheese, with the beef. I asked for it medium, but it came seriously overcooked. I didn&#039;t think the meat was that flavorful, or at least that it was a good flavor. I had it on the brioche bun, which seemed kind of stale. <br /><br />My partner had the veggie burger, which isn&#039;t a housemade burger, but an Amy&#039;s frozen patty (waitress told us). She said the burger tasted like it was microwaved -- mushy in the middle and hard on the outside. If you&#039;re going to use a frozen store brand patty, at least prepare it better. Petey&#039;s, otoh, makes two different kinds of excellent veggie burgers in house and is a fraction of the cost of the Bareburger veggie burger.<br /><br />The fries were okay, not awesome but okay. With the fries we got the spicy chipotle sauce. We consider ourselves connoisseurs of the dipping sauce and this sauce was watery and not really spicy at all (for an excellent chipotle dipping sauce, we highly recommend Press 195 in Bayside/Park Slope or Stew Leonard&#039;s). The onion rings were good. The milkshake (plain ol&#039; chocolate) was great, but can you really screw up a milkshake? My partner had the diet cane cola which was kind of odd tasting. The decor of the place was nice. The service was lacking -- our waitress&#039; shift ended and we sat there for a good 10-15 minutes before someone acknowledged our presence and brought us the check. <br /><br />For $42, this was a pretty sucky meal. We definitely won&#039;t go back -- which is disappointing because we live around the corner and could always use another local place to add to our dining out/ordering in rotation.

				Their excuse regarding overcooking seems to be that it&#039;s hard to make the burgers juicy and delicious because the meat is very lean. I&#039;m no burger chef, so I&#039;m not sure how leanness of the meat relates to the color of a cooked burger, but if the case is that they simply cannot cook burgers as requested, they should note that on their menu. Waitresses should convey that to anyone who requests anything below well done. And make sure all the cooks are on the same page. They seem to be terribly inconsistent.<br /><br />All I know is that when I want a burger, I want it to be delicious. I don&#039;t want a dry, overcooked burger, regardless of how lean and &quot;healthy&quot; it is. I just want it to be very tasty and cooked the way it&#039;s ordered, with no gristle or mystery particles in the burger, and perhaps some toppings. Otherwise, I will eat something that isn&#039;t a burger.

				Not to be a pain, but why do people keep going here? The reviews are almost completely negative, with the same complaints (burgers not cooked as ordered, crappy service, expensive, etc.) over and over. Seems like a place that everyone wanted to like, but it hasn&#039;t delivered. There&#039;s a lot of good restaurants in Astoria (and the extending area) that deserve to be frequented over a place that just doesn&#039;t seem to get it. Just my two cents.

				I ate in Bare Burger.<br />Sure they got some glitches but no biggi.<br />They fix most of it and their burgers are excellent.

Who in God&#039;s name orders a veggie burger and have expectations its going to be good?<br />Unless Diet coke tastes good to you.<br />Rockaway beach is the most beautiful beach u ever seen in your life.<br />And flan is the most luscious dessert u ever had. <br />Obviously u like to go to a steakhouse and order grilled Portobello mushrooms sandwich w/ steak sauce.<br /><br />And to the astorian who thinks is overpriced &amp; that Jackson Hole &quot;rocks&quot;:<br />Are you insane? Jackson hole is that a --HOLE. Their burgers are greasy and awful. I bet u think Boston Market is a gourmet meal. <br />Second, next time you go to any restaurant in NYC watch what you order --restaurants are here to make money not to be cheap and lose revenue so they can compete with greasy diners. <br /><br />Comprende?<br /><br />Jean Georges sales a dinner for one for $35 but if you start ordering sides w/ desperation ur check goes up. <br /><br />FYI restaurants are business.

				I had Bareburger over two weeks ago and am only getting to the review now.&nbsp; The place did make an impression on me though, enough that I can remember the details quite lucidly.<br /><br />First off, the place is gorgeous.&nbsp; It was designed and decorated well.&nbsp; The bathrooms are state of the art.&nbsp; Every aesthetic exudes of modern and eco-friendly green.&nbsp; Seriously, I thought the place looked awesome.<br /><br />And that&#039;s where the compliments end.&nbsp; Hey, I said the place made an impression, not the food.<br /><br />So here we go.<br /><br />I ordered the regular beef burger, the original, with cheese medium rare, and my wife ordered the one with guacamole -- we were and still are in a huge avocado kick -- cooked medium well along with a vanilla milkshake.<br /><br />For all their pride in using &quot;natural&quot; or top grade meat, they sure add a lot of seasoning, which is fine, if that&#039;s the chef&#039;s personal taste.&nbsp; More than any other spice, the meat was loaded with pepper.&nbsp; It just happens to be that I love my pepper, so it was tasty in that regard, but I can see how purists would see this as a cowardly way out of showcasing the supreme quality of the meat.&nbsp; As well-seasoned as it was, the fact that they didn&#039;t know how to control the temperature of the grill is inexcusable.&nbsp; My &quot;medium rare&quot; was clearly cooked well-done.&nbsp; My wife&#039;s &quot;medium well&quot; was chewy, dry, and a bit like crumbled jerky.&nbsp; But, it was well-seasoned, so in her case, it was well-seasoned jerky.<br /><br />To me, a burger should be seared shut over high heat to retain all of its moisture.&nbsp; Layers of richness (usually the cheese and sauce/dressing) are then added to ensure max moistness and juiciness.&nbsp; An inherently excellent and juicy burger doesn&#039;t even need sauce, because the sear on the meat did its job of maintaining the moisture.&nbsp; In Bareburger&#039;s case, not having the sauce would have been painful to swallow.<br /><br />The toppings on my burger were fine.&nbsp; Nothing to brag about, nothing to snicker at either.&nbsp; On my wife&#039;s, the guacamole was probably the saddest &quot;fresh&quot; guacamole I&#039;ve ever seen comparable only to grocery store-bought artificial varieties.&nbsp; The most obvious shortcoming of their guacamole was that it was made a while ago.&nbsp; The tomatoes were soggy and limp, which made the guacamole runny.&nbsp; The avocados had oxidized, turning it much darker and less appealing.&nbsp; Thank god they were not generous with it as it only comprised of a small, thin layer on the burger.&nbsp; Both the amount of guacamole and the way in which it was made/tasted could not justify the extra couple of dollars they charged for it.<br /><br />The bread was fine.&nbsp; The brioche was neither inspiring nor deflating.&nbsp; It did its job although it&#039;s nothing to write home about.<br /><br />Then comes the shake.&nbsp; It was unanimously the best part of the meal.&nbsp; It was cold, rich, creamy, and in a reasonable (slightly small) portion enough to satisfy those who can easily satisfy their sugar tooth with moderate servings.&nbsp; Of course, for those of us who like a heaping mound of dessert, it definitely won&#039;t curb those joneses.&nbsp; The biggest disappointment with the shake was that it didn&#039;t really taste of vanilla.&nbsp; It was just smooth, creamy, and dense.&nbsp; But the flavor was lacking.&nbsp; It might behoove them to add a little more vanilla to their vanilla or by giving the shake a good douse of extract before serving.<br /><br />The service was good.&nbsp; I actually liked it quite a bit.&nbsp; Kind waiters and waitresses (different people waited on us).&nbsp; In the end and except for the food (which wasn&#039;t bad, it just wasn&#039;t good either), it was a very pleasant experience.<br /><br /><br />By the end, I paid $30 for a pleasant experience but lackluster food.&nbsp; You can tell that they put a lot of thought into the menu and that in theory it should all taste amazing.&nbsp; They clearly spent money on the location and carefully sourced their food.&nbsp; But the cooks in the kitchen is where it all starts to unravel.&nbsp; They should have spent a little more money there and hired themselves some better burger flippers instead of the space age bathroom.<br /><br />Food: C<br />Portion Size: B-<br />Value: C-<br />Would I Recommend?&nbsp; I appreciate how the owners/designer but a lot of time and thought into the place.&nbsp; I was sorely disappointed with the execution of the food.&nbsp; That being said, because my experience was pleasant overall, I would give them another chance.&nbsp; If they disappoint me again...well then never again...can&#039;t fool me twice.

				Just tried bareburger with my wife since we both heard so much abt it&nbsp; /&nbsp; I had&nbsp; the swiss turkey burger with fries and she had the blue cheese burger no fries .&nbsp; Tasted pretty good , no complaints but for $30 dollars we were both kinda shocked . The place looks nice and their ideas seem good but way too much money these days . We ordered to go and she didnt even get a side and neither of us got drinks , so basically&nbsp; if we stayed (tip abt $7) and did get drinks and an extra fry it wouldve been abt $45 .&nbsp; &nbsp;Dont know how people r gonna keep going back with those types of prices . Sure astoria has alot of people who love to eat out and many people are on the health tip&nbsp; but going there with the wife &amp; kids&nbsp; would equal abt $100 a meal for burgers in the end .<br /><br />P.s&nbsp; one of my friends knows one of the owners and he told me that the owner reads alot of reviews online including this site . maybe he will get the hint abt the prices being way too high

				I&#039;m just curious as to when they&#039;re going to take the hint.&nbsp; I mean - really?&nbsp; How many people have to write that the burgers are overcooked before they change it?&nbsp; Or at the VERY least - could they tell us as to why they refuse to cook the burgers differently?&nbsp; Maybe there&#039;s a reason (although, I can&#039;t imagine one that would outweigh our need for a good burger).&nbsp; <br /><br />HELLO TO BARE BURGER!&nbsp; PLEASE STOP OVERCOOKING YOUR BURGERS OR TELL US WHY YOU DO.<br /><br />PLEASE.<br /><br />Sorry about the caps, I just really want to like this place - the organic stance?&nbsp; don&#039;t know why really - and I know I&#039;m not alone - but I can&#039;t bring myself to go back there again until I hear better things about the meat.

				That is such a shame.&nbsp; I really want to try this place, but overcooked burgers really turn me off - especially if they claim to cook to order.&nbsp; And the &quot;organic meat is leaner and not as juicy&quot; is such a cop-out -- I also buy organic/grass fed/finished yada yada meat (and in addition to beef/lamb I have at various times bought whole/ground bison, ostrich and elk) all the time and it&#039;s not difficult to cook it properly.&nbsp; Slightly different, yes; difficult, no.

				I have gone a handful of times because my boyfriend loves burgers and shakes.. I am from the Midwest and eating game meats of all variety was pretty much the norm. I have consumed vast amounts of venison, buffalo/bison, moose/elk, etc, and even bear meat if you can believe that lol &nbsp;:-o. We also had a few ostrich farms back where I&#039;m from so I even had that before eating at Bareburger. <br />Needless to say, I am tough to please since I know my game meats. I normally tend to stick with the ostrich burger, if not that then the piedmont beef. The Bison was okay but not great since it was overcooked. Maybe they were having an off day since they normally cook my ostrich burger fine every time I order it. The elk burger I will NEVER order again, it was literally the most gamey tasting elk I have ever had. There is a number of reasons that could&#039;ve of caused the elk to taste THAT gamey. I am a bit curious as to who their source is for elk meat? &nbsp;If they process the elk meat into patties themselves then maybe they are not trimming enough fat off, a lot of that gamey taste is in the fat. Either way, a little bit of good seasoning could&#039;ve went a long way in making that elk burger taste better, gamey or not!<br />I think my favorite item at Bareburger aside from their ostrich burger is their shakes! They have the BEST pistachio shake I have ever had, no lie!!!!

				I find all the talk about how they &quot;should lower their prices&quot; funny. Why would they if they&#039;re a big hit and people will overpay for it? Business is booming -- you lower prices when you need incentive to get people in the door.<br /><br />Heck, I&#039;m a vegetarian and I love this place. I&#039;ve ordered from it three times in the past two weeks. I don&#039;t care about the veggie/portabello burgers, so I don&#039;t order those anymore. Meh. But the fries, dipping sauces, salads and shakes are super-tasty. <br /><br />It&#039;s not good for my waistline or my wallet, but I&#039;m hooked.

If you won&#039;t cook your burgers to order, it means you don&#039;t trust your meat. I have a real problem with a place that doesn&#039;t flat-out say they will not cook something below a certain doneness, especially when they will let you order that way but then just send out something cooked more. That isn&#039;t the right way to do business and from the reviews, sounds like how Bareburger runs their restaurant - unless, of course, it&#039;s that they just have incompetent cooks. Not sure which one is worse in the end. Either will keep me from giving them my business, however.

				I&#039;m a big burger fan and I have to say I loved the 3 times I&#039;ve eaten at Bareburger. The meat was excellent and I asked for it medium (which I guess is their default). I&#039;ve also had medium rare there too and my husband got his rare and we were satisfied. Most places default to medium well as a food safety handling issue. If you ask for another temp, I&#039;ve never had a problem getting it there. But hey, different strokes. I&#039;ve tried 5 guys and maybe it was an off night there but I thought it was awful, flavorless, and tougher than a hockey puck when I asked for it medium. Shake Shack, Bareburger and Donnovans are my top 3 for burgers. All the times I&#039;ve had fries there they were awesome too.

				Don&#039;t think Sweet Afton has a good vegetarian selection. Yeah there&#039;s macaroni and cheese, and grilled cheese, and fried pickles.......eh, I dunno, guess for a bar what can you expect. Just wish there were a portobello burger, for example.

				Did the Brioche bun change?<br /><br />The last two burgers I purchased had a flakey, mushy, very soft bun. <br /><br />When I first moved to Astoria a year ago - the bun was firm, and definitely not flakey. <br /><br /><br />Anyone know whats going on?<br />

				you think with a name like culinary spotter...you would get a review more than &quot;nothing special but above avg&quot;<br /><br />you dont find it special that you can order a burger made from weird and wacky animal meat like bison, elk or ostrich.&nbsp; i think thats kinda special no?&nbsp; what about choice of breads?&nbsp; beer selection?

				We have started eating here lately also..<br /><br />I tried the bison the first time but didnt love it. I had never had bison before so maybe I just dont like it. <br /><br />The next time I had beef and I was happy :) hubby is into the elk which he has had a few times there.&nbsp; I also tried the chicken and pickle sandwich which is tasty :)&nbsp; Fries and onion rings, shakes and the dipping sauces all delish too.

				<br />BB certainly has its fans. When it is good, it can be the best.

				I read the complaints above about wrong degrees of cooking. My girlfriend and have been twice, and we like the food, but today we both ordered burgers medium rare and we both got rare. We were hungry so we just dealt. But had I read this thread first, I would have sent mine back. <br /><br />The burgers are very good. I&#039;ll give them another shot.

				I had the Ommegang beer. It was really good. <br />My Boyfriend had Wolaver&#039;s.<br />The beer selection is really good. A lot of local and small brewerys are represented. <br />&nbsp;<br />I didn&#039;t taste the veggie burger but just looking at it I knew it was better than most because it had a burger like texture and just looked like meat. None of the usual mushiness that you would associate with a veggie burger. If you are really a meat lover I would stick with meat but I don&#039;t think you would be disappointed by the veggie.
