				I just tried them last night and was pleasantly surprised. I had heard that Watawa was the best but I found everything very bland. Everyone has different ideas on what is good but I think others should try Sakura. They never seem to be very busy and I would hate for them to go under. I ordered take-out and they brought me a glass of ice water while I waited and even included a free can of coke as a hidden surprise when I got home. :mrgreen:

				I&#039;ve tried Sakura a few times and it was quite good. The first time I went I was skeptical b/c of the lower cost (compared to Watawa and JJs), but went ahead and ordered sake don (salmon sashimi over sushi rice) anyway.&nbsp; The salmon was very fresh and the portion was rather generous, not to mention that it came with soup, salad AND a bowl of edamame. <br /><br />I like Watawa as well, so I might end up splitting up my sushi visits depending on what I have a &quot;yen&quot; for.&nbsp; :-D

				Sakura is on the north side of Ditmars between 35th and 36th Sts.&nbsp; We&#039;re quite happy with them as a neighbourhood sushi place; we haven&#039;t been to Watawa in quite some time - Sakura is definitely a better value.&nbsp; They are very friendly, and the fish is always fresh.&nbsp; They also do an ume shiso roll, and at Watawa they had never even heard of it when I asked if they would make one.

				count me in as another one who prefers Sakura to Watawa.&nbsp; Not only are they a little cheaper, but I think the food is slightly better and the service is always impeccable.&nbsp;

				I agree.&nbsp; The food&#039;s great and the prices are cheaper.&nbsp; I really like a lot of their special rolls.&nbsp; I also like their portions which seem more than Watawa.&nbsp; I like Watawa too but it&#039;s great to have other options.

				I like Sakura too.&nbsp; I usually go for lunch, but have been for dinner at least a couple of times.&nbsp; The food can be very good, though a couple of times I thought it wasn&#039;t great.&nbsp; The place is particularly comfortable for me, and they always offer wonderful service.&nbsp; I also like patronizing this establishment.&nbsp; I know Watawa seems to get the glory, but I may enjoy going to Sakura as much or more, in part because it&#039;s a better value, and more relaxing to be there.

				Ok -- I went to Sakura last night, and it&#039;s the best sushi in town. I&#039;ve been to Watawa four times, and Linn (on B-way between 29th/30th) once. Linn was good, but very pricey, and Watawa has some decent stuff, but the fish always seems bland.<br /><br />I sat at the Sushi bar at Sakura and was awarded with two free pieces of Sashimi, and a delicious sashimi seaweed salad to start. And the best part is that the food is *extremely* inexpensive. Most pieces of sushi are 2 dollars? A special combo with 18 pieces of fish, and 2 rolls is 35 dollars? That&#039;s absurd. Anyway. I recommend it, great service, huge cuts of fish, just all around good.

				I also like Sakura and I prefer it to Watawa, which IMO is extremely overrated. <br /><br />

				I&#039;ve wondered if Watawa is over-rated too.&nbsp; I do know that they somehow seem to have never stopped being confused by the concept of a vegetarian entering their restaurant.&nbsp; Sakura is great for vegetarians, and they are prepared to go through their menu pointing out all of the veg options (which are numerous) and which don&#039;t work.&nbsp; At Watawa, each time I&#039;ve been there, they&#039;ve seemed at a loss, and brand new to the concept.

				yes this is good news.....<br /><br /><br />everyone who eats at Watawa should move to Sakura. Enjoy.

				Speaking of Watawa, it looks like Watawa has bought the property next door to them and is expanding. I passed by it tonight and they had a sign up saying they are expanding to have a bar/lounge area.

				I&#039;m yet another person that prefers Sakura over Watawa.&nbsp; Friendlier staff, cheaper food, roomier tables (although I would love to sidewalk space), and as subjective as it may be, tastier food.

				Love Sakura, friendly, quiet, good food and personally, I&#039;m glad they don&#039;t have a sidewalk cafe. <br />The folks who are sitting outside at Watawa are really right on the sidewalk.... looks uncomfortable.

				Sakura always has the yummiest, top quality sushi. I still frequent watawa a lot because I am obsessed with the fuji roll, but I have to say the quality of the fish is about twice as good at Sakura. And they seem to really appreciate my business, friendly service and they like to give freebies...
