								<div class="inner" id="msg_222616">OK, maybe not &quot;avoid&quot; the entire fee altogether, but I had to get your attention with the subject line somehow. But I&#039;ll explain how you can at least pay less than that one-month&#039;s-rent rule every broker seems to have. I&#039;m pretty convinced that one of the reasons brokers in this city have such a stranglehold on the real estate market, and can charge such ridiculous fees for such bad service, is because most renters simply don&#039;t know any better. Or they&#039;re too afraid to negotiate. Yes, a lot of it has to do with simple supply and demand, but lots of brokers make lots of money by depending on the ignorance of their clients. Don&#039;t be one of those clients.<br /><br />At the beginning of the year, I moved to Astoria from Sunnyside. I had already scoped out Astoria and knew I wanted to live here. In just under a month, I met with 20 brokers and saw 25 different apartments before finally settling on a place. Here&#039;s what I learned.<br />&nbsp;<br />You know how most brokers have you fill out a form or a little index card with your name and contact info, and then have you sign the agreement at the bottom that says you&#039;ll pay them one month&#039;s rent as a finder&#039;s fee if you rent from them? <strong>DON&#039;T SIGN IT</strong>. In fact, <strong>DON&#039;T SIGN ANYTHING</strong>. This is the single most important thing you can (not) do in order to get out of that broker&#039;s fee. That little card is a legal contract, no matter how amateurish it looks. If you sign that paper, and that broker shows you an apartment you really want, you&#039;re committed to that fee. Again, <strong>DO NOT SIGN ANYTHING BEFORE SEEING AN APARTMENT</strong>. I can&#039;t stress that enough.<br />&nbsp;<br />Now you may be thinking, &quot;But everyone signs those things, I saw whole stacks of those cards with people&#039;s signatures in every broker&#039;s office.&quot; Yes, you did. Those people didn&#039;t know any better. They shouldn&#039;t have signed them. Now, to be clear, when they ask you to sign the form and you decline, you shouldn&#039;t be confrontational about it. Don&#039;t get into an argument right off the bat. Every time a broker presented me with one of these forms, I would just politely say that I wasn&#039;t comfortable signing anything in advance. Sometimes I would frown at the contract and feign confusion (even though it&#039;s pretty straightforward) and say that I wasn&#039;t a lawyer and didn&#039;t really know what to make of this big tangle of words, and how about we just go see the apartment and talk about the broker&#039;s fee later?<br />&nbsp;<br />And if they refuse to show you an apartment without signing something first? Fine. Tell them politely that you&#039;ll have to go elsewhere. And why should you feel pressured to sign something before even seeing a place, anyway? It&#039;s not like finding another broker is hard in this neighborhood. Brokers are a dime a dozen here. They&#039;re on every corner. Worried that the broker you just refused to sign with has a great apartment that only he knows about? He doesn&#039;t. We all know how most of them bait-and-switch people anyway with the initial Craigslist photos or descriptions they tell you about just to get you in the door. And don&#039;t believe anything about &quot;exclusive&quot; access to an apartment that only this one broker has. Why would a landlord let only one broker show his place? The landlord wants to fill it as soon possible, and you&#039;re paying the broker&#039;s fee. The more brokers he has showing the place, the faster it&#039;ll get filled. The broker doesn&#039;t care which middle-man gets the new tenant. <br />&nbsp;<br />So let&#039;s say you see a few places (without having signed anything first), and you think you like a couple of them. Start negotiating the broker&#039;s fee. They&#039;ll always start at one month&#039;s rent. But why should it be that way? What&#039;s the logic of that? Imagine you&#039;re considering an $800 studio. The broker would want $800 for his fee. Now imagine you tell him you want to check out the $2,000 two-bedroom upstairs. He&#039;ll want $2,000 for his fee for that one. But why should he charge more for that second one? The broker does <em><strong>the exact same amount of work in getting you each apartment</strong>,</em> yet somehow his work is worth $1,200 more for the bigger one. Why?! The reason, of course, is that they assume you have more money if you&#039;re going for the $2,000 apartment and are better able to afford a $2,000 fee. In a way, you can&#039;t blame them. Lots of businesses charge different prices to different customers for the same product or service. But that doesn&#039;t mean you have to fall for it. I asked several of them this very question during my search. They&#039;d usually respond with &quot;That&#039;s our policy, that&#039;s the way it is.&quot; And I would say, &quot;Yes, but <strong><em>why</em></strong> is that your policy?&quot; while making the point about charging far more money for the same amount of work. At this point I&#039;d usually get a vacant stare, followed by irritated attempts to change the subject. But just by bringing it up, you let them know that a one-month&#039;s rental fee is illogical and too much. They&#039;ll already be mentally adjusting their price.<br />&nbsp;<br />To be fair, not every broker was like this. When I brought this point up with one guy I spoke with over the phone, he told me he charged a flat fee of $1,000, including all credit checks, paper work, etc. for all apartments. So at least someone seems to get it. Nevertheless, $1,000 just to get you keys and print out some paperwork is still a ripoff. So how do you get it lower?<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Do all the things you would normally do if you&#039;re negotiating a big purchase, like a car. Don&#039;t ever reveal that you love a place. Even if you find a place you like, it&#039;ll be far from perfect, since this is New York housing we&#039;re talking about, after all. When they&#039;re showing you a place, every time they boast of some feature, point out some feature you don&#039;t like. Tell them you&#039;re considering other places that you like better (which you probably are). Look up the management company of the building and see if they&#039;ve had any violations. If so, mention them. When they ask you when you&#039;re looking to move, <em><strong>tell them you&#039;re flexible and have no firm date, and that you&#039;re currently in a month-to-month lease</strong></em>. Otherwise, they&#039;ll know you&#039;re desperate as your move-out dates approaches. You have to give them some assurance that you&#039;re ready to move soon, but don&#039;t reveal a firm date. All those things together will make the sale tougher and make them more willing to drop the fee.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;In the end, of the 20 brokers I met with, here&#039;s how they broke down:<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;11 just showed up at the agreed location and didn&#039;t attempt to make me sign anything beforehand. Of these, 2 offered me a discount of a couple hundred bucks off the broker&#039;s fee right off the bat, without me even asking about it. (One, strangely, refused to tell me her fee after I asked following the apartment showing, and insisted that we&#039;d talk about that later. Another one tried to get me to sign the agreement <em>after</em> we&#039;d seen the apartment, saying we couldn&#039;t go forward without me signing. I refused. Lo and behold, she called a few days later to see if I was interested in the place.)<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;5 initially wanted me to sign the form before seeing anything; after giving them the routine I outlined above, they relented. One of these guys showed me a second place a few days later, and told me the owner would be paying the broker&#039;s fee if I wanted it.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;4 wanted to me to sign something and after my refusal, they refused to show me anything. We were deadlocked, so I left.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;So what ended up happening in my case? My hours of trawling Cragislist ads finally paid off when I found a no-broker&#039;s fee apartment. They&#039;re there if you look long enough. Unfortunately, brokers have totally flooded that site, and places listed as no-broker-fee are almost always bullshit. But the occasional legit listing is there and luckily it was also my first choice of the places I saw. But had I chosen another place, I&#039;m sure I would have paid quite a bit less than a month&#039;s rent for any broker&#039;s fee.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;The bigger point is that brokers wouldn&#039;t charge so much <em><strong>if renters simply stood tough and negotiated hard from the beginning. </strong></em>So this post isn&#039;t as much about sharing some secret weapon to let you get out of a broker&#039;s fee while everyone else suffers as much as it is about exhorting my fellow Astorians and New Yorkers to collectively change their behavior when apartment hunting. Tell your friends! Spread the word! Seriously, if everyone just started by agreeing not to sign that broker&#039;s agreement in advance, it would go a long way to making brokers more competitive with their fees. If renters stood up for themselves a little more, en masse, we would pay a lot less for the &quot;service&quot; brokers provide. Do it!</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_222630">Thanks Alex123 and Jennifersciumi. And if anyone else has any other tips, please share! The more transparent the broker process is, and more information renters have, the less able brokers will be to charge this ridiculous markup for their fees.<br /><br /><br />Also, one edit from my original post: I should have said &quot;the <strong>landlord</strong> doesn&#039;t care which middle-man gets the new tenant,&quot; not &quot;broker.&quot;</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_223092">@ NYC Native:<br /><br />It&#039;s well-nigh impossible for people who want to find a no-fee rental to simply find a no-fee rental. I managed to do it, but it was only by sifting through hundreds of Cragislist ads, day after day for weeks, before one Sunday I just happened to be in an Astoria Starbucks looking through the ads and found a legit no-broker fee for a place that I liked. Luckily, i was the first to see the place.<br /><br />Up until then, EVERY &quot;no-fee&quot; listing I saw on Craigslist was in fact just a broker using their first name only with a cell phone number that was probably pre-paid and changeable. Trying to report all these fraudsters to the local housing authority and expect results would be a waste of time. I also tried walking through Astoria all day one Saturday randomly ringing supers&#039; buzzers and asking if anything was available for rent. Of course I got nowhere. But really, how sensible is that plan anyway? You have no idea what any random apartment looks like based on the outside of a building, so it&#039;s a million-to-one odds of finding something that way.<br /><br />I suppose my initial post was a long-winded way of saying we all know that rental brokers in this city charge far too much for what they provide, and it&#039;s ridiculous that they even charge anything at all to renters, as they&#039;re doing the landlords a favor, not the renters. The landlords should be the ones paying the broker&#039;s fee. There are many theories as to why brokers manage to continue to be such a rip-off (seen here in this article, which is mostly about home sales, but applies to rentals too: <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21554204" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.economist.com/node/21554204</a>), but the sucker theory is one I&#039;m partial to. And so I was telling people a few simple steps for how they can avoid being a sucker in the negotiation process to lower that fee.<br /><br />Yes, if you&#039;ve just arrived in NYC, and you have no time to find a place, and a broker needs to arrange 10 apartments for you to view in 3 days, they deserve a fee for their work. But otherwise they&#039;re generally useless middlemen who are only able to charge the fees they do by maintaining a cartel-like stranglehold on information--namely, a database of available rentals.</div>
