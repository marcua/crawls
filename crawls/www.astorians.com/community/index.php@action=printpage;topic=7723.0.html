				ANIMATED COPS TO PATROL WEB IN CHINA.<br />The Chinese government announced today that it would use animated beat<br />&nbsp;cops<br />to patrol 13 of China&#039;s top Web portals in an effort to steer users<br />&nbsp;away<br />from illegal content, reports THE ASSOCIATED PRESS. Starting Sept. 1,<br />&nbsp;2007,<br />the cartoon cops will walk, bike and drive across Web surfers&#039; screens<br />every half hour, warning them to stay clear of material &quot;the Communist<br />Party finds politically or morally threatening.&quot; By the end of the<br />&nbsp;year,<br />the animated warning will appear on all websites registered with<br />&nbsp;Beijing<br />servers.<br /><br />Designed by Web firm Sohu, the male and female cartoon characters are<br />&nbsp;meant<br />to startle users and remind them that the government is monitoring Web<br />usage. Additionally, if surfers need police assistance, they can click<br />&nbsp;on<br />the characters, which link to the police authority&#039;s website. <br /><br />In a statement, the Beijing Public Security Ministry said, &quot;We will<br />continue to promote new images of the virtual police and update our<br />Internet security tips in an effort to make the image of the virtual<br />&nbsp;police<br />more user-friendly and more in tune with how Web surfers use the<br />&nbsp;Internet.&quot;<br /><br />

				At least speeders are breaking a law that is there for everyone&#039;s safety, all these people in China are doing is checking out web sites the state forbids.<br /><br />Got to hand it to the Chinese gov&#039;t, they keep thinking of new ways to keep fascism working.

				Websites or internet domains that are deemed by the Chinese government to contain objectionable material - often political in nature, for example, anything concerning Tibet - are blocked by government firewalls.&nbsp; The use of internet police is probably a response to the fact that actual internet users in China have become a lot more savvy about getting around the government firewalls.<br /><br />http://www.greatfirewallofchina.org/ (especially the faq section)<br />http://chandan.myblog.com/75352.html<br /><br />Big brother, yes, but not fascism - growing pains, if anything.&nbsp; China is changing tremendously - at warp speed.&nbsp; The Cultural Revolution ended 30 years ago, and China joined the WTO only in 2001.&nbsp; The high school and college students of today - the ones most likely to be internet users - are the first generation not to have grown up under the political indoctrination of the Mao era. <br /><br />For the record, astorians.com is accessible in China.&nbsp; But now that we&#039;re discussing this, I&#039;m sure it will be blocked right away.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)&nbsp;

				I can&#039;t attest to the veracity of the article that I attached, but I heard before about Internet browsers agreeing to censor Internet sites that the Chinese government deemed subversive.&nbsp; If I&#039;m not mistaken, people who worked for the American companies involved, argued that they did more good &quot;engaging&quot; China instead of isolating them further. <br /><br />http://news.zdnet.co.uk/internet/0,1000000097,39161877,00.htm<br /><br /><br />

				There was an article on NYT.com earlier today which said that Thailand has just lifted a ban on Youtube (originally placed because of a video mocking the Thai king).&nbsp; I&#039;ve been looking for it and can&#039;t find it.&nbsp; At the end of the article, it also said that Yahoo or Google have agreed to block sites to users in Germany and France that deal with Holocaust denial.<br /><br />heff, I&#039;m aware of the Tibet situation but I also think it is a lot more complex than what you presented.&nbsp; There are radical Tibetan groups based in India, but the Dalai Lama won&#039;t meet or engage with them.&nbsp; There are problems with the educational system in Tibet, especially the language of instruction, but the biggest problem is funding, the same as in China, and with children gaining access to education at all.&nbsp; Traditional Tibetan culture will never be allowed to die out in the Tibetan Autonomous Region, because of its attraction to tourism, which is a huge cash cow.&nbsp; Tourists cannot travel anywhere outside of Lhasa without obtaining a travel permit, which you can only get by hiring a driver and guide for each day of travel - very costly. <br /><br />So the Tibet situation might qualify the Chinese government as fascist in your definition, but it is a big difference from a fascist society.&nbsp; I am not condoning internet censorship, but I am saying that there is a lot more information and discourse available to individuals than the press on censorship in China would lead people to believe.&nbsp; And if the government doesn&#039;t go through with &quot;vulgar&quot; censorship, it is because the people won&#039;t stand for it or will find a way to get around it, aided by new technology.&nbsp; The biggest problem will be if the current urban generation, who have the potential to become something like the baby boomer generation in the U.S., cease to care.&nbsp; The greatest worry I have regarding censorship, quite frankly, is censorship of textbooks and what young people are learning about China&#039;s history vis-a-vis their Asian neighbors, especially Japan.

				<br />Imagine if the US would block sites because of objection to the content.<br />I think it is important to take the media with grains of salt. It can be trying sifting through layers of spin.<br /><br /><br />And, here, I ask if I am as free now as I was 4 years ago or 10 years ago. It may not be as easy to arrange a protest but still possible. Might be more cautious about dissent but still feel largely free to speak.<br /><br />One good thing for China is that many Chinese have experiences living in other countries of the &#039;free&#039; world.<br /><br /><br /><br />In advance of what comes next, I still worry more about promotion of fearing another country more than the limited threat posed by others.<br />Fear, what is it good for?<br /><br />Found something also of interest - <br /><br />http://normblog.typepad.com/normblog/<br /><br />**<br /><br />&quot;In my Normblog interview, I was asked about threats to the future peace and stability of the world. Islamofascism was #1, of course, but I also spent a bit of time explaining my worries about one possible future for China: a future of <strong>state capitalism under dictatorial control,</strong> a strong need for external resources to fuel that economy, carefully fostered xenophobia, a legacy of belief in the racial superiority of Chinese peoples, a major demographic problem in an excess of young males, and the meme that China is being cheated of its rightful place in the world. Germany&#039;s history in the 20th century teaches us what this combination portends.&quot;<br /><br />:<br />Germany in the years of 1933 to 1945, when it was governed by&nbsp; (National <span class="bbc_u">Socialist </span> German Workers Party)
