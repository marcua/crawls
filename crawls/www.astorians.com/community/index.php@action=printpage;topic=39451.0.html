				I heard 5-7 shots. I got to bed late and couldn&#039;t fall asleep right away because I was a bit tipsy, so yeah I heard them. I wonder what it was all about.

				I heard shooting in the same vicinity Saturday afternoon. Sounded more like a shotgun than a revolver though.

				Why is the 114 so absent? You occasionally see them driving around and that&#039;s it. We are a tightly packed urban environment with a ton of retail, restaurants, and bars yet they never walk around. It seems like a no brainer that they would be on the ground in the area where the shooting was as those are ongoing problem spots.

				I happened to speak to a few of the police officers yesterday near the street closures. I was told that all of these crime related issues are a result of the Steinway Hookah bars that attract a rough crowd from neighborhoods such as the Bronx. The cops I spoke to said this shooting was probably drug or gang related. A few bars were named (Melody Café on Steinway St. was one in specific). We&#039;ve had several shootings in this specific area over the past year, and I am getting tired of it. This is a safe neighborhood with a lot of great places to eat and enjoy. However, if these businesses are attracting gang members, it&#039;s time to raise the issue to the Community Board/City Council. If the city does not have enough cops to patrol the streets, then these establishments should either be shut down or forced to give up their liquor license.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Cant single out &quot;these businesses&quot;.. it&#039;s racist. which is why it seems that double/triple parking along Steinway is seemingly legal.

				All you have to do is walk up and down the block and you&#039;ll see that the hookah places are different from each other. To me it seems some are more conservative and laid back and don&#039;t pose a problem, whereas others have much more of a club vibe, and the latter is the problem.<br /><br />As for &quot;these businesses&quot; and &quot;it&#039;s racist&quot;.... well, I guess that depends on what you&#039;re talking about....<br /><br />And yeah, the double parking is super annoying, and I don&#039;t even drive!

				In terms of the double parking..the NYPD doesn&#039;t even attempt to address the issue. If it were up to me I&#039;d make Steinway transit/pedestrian only.

				The 114<sup>th</sup> had a checkpoint set up at 28<sup>th</sup>/Steinway last night, similar to what you might see when cops set up a drunk driving checkpoint. Four police vehicles with lights on, flares in the intersection, and 7 or 8 cops directing traffic and pulling certain cars over to check ID. I’m not sure how much this will actually help w the issues that have been happening on Steinway, especially on a Tuesday night, but at least they were doing something visible. I hope they do this on weekend nights when the general douchebaggery factor on that corner tends to go up exponentially.
