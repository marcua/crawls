				Hi<br /><br />My cheap landlord says that I need to replace my own kitchen floor.&nbsp; He&#39;ll pay some of the cost, but he says that because it&#39;s the tiles, it&#39;s a decorative thing and he doesn&#39;t have to pay the entire cost.&nbsp; <br /><br />My boyfriend and roommate are sissy boys and have no idea how to re-floor a very tiny kitchen.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-o <br /><br />Do you know where I can get a REALLY good rate on this?....<br /><br />Thanks so much!

				Are you living in an apartment with *any* controls? Or are you in a small walk-up consisting of less than 6 tenants?<br /><br />If it is just the tiles that are loose, damaged or just plain filthy, you could do it yourself with supplies from Home Depot and a good scissors.<br /><br />But, if the floor itself is damaged, then you will need to put down a new subfloor. That is not gonna be done cheaply by anyone. In order to put down a new subfloor *everything* in the kitchen needs to come out. Stove. Refrigerator. Cabinets. Sink. I did it a couple of years ago. There is *nothing*, (just in case you don&#39;t get my drift I&#39;m gonna repeat that) <strong>*NOTHING*</strong> in the whole world that will ever make me do *that* again!<br /><br />NYCMacUser<br /><br />

He&#39;s probably right that he doesn&#39;t legally have to do it, but if you move out, he certainly will have to do it then if he wants anyone not on drugs to rent the place. How long are you going to be in that place? Self-stick 12&quot; tiles are (if I recall) less than $1/sq ft, although they&#39;ll probably only last a couple years if you&#39;re putting them on top of a dirty subfloor. I can be a bit too confrontational myself, but I might remind your landlord that you won&#39;t be there forever, and also that a damaged floor will lead to water damage to the subfloor (assuming you mop occasionally), which will cost a lot more to replace later than sooner. <br />

				Thanks for the very helpful info.&nbsp; I don&#39;t think the floor itself is damaged, just the &quot;stick on floor squares&quot; are coming up and are really gross.&nbsp; <br /><br />Cheers to fix-it-men!<br /><br />I&#39;ll let you know how the repairs go...
