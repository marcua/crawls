				Does anyone take their children to the pediatricians there? Dr. Sharon Ho or Dr. Greendyk? Someone recommended them, but I don&#039;t know much about them.

				I do.&nbsp; I love the doctors at this practice but the front desk is not always so great and the neighborhood is a little rough.&nbsp; Feel free to email me if you have more questions.

				I did. Once. I never returned because the support staff was awful. When I first moved to Astoria, they were the closest in network facility so I tried them out. Aside from the front desk being awful, we had never done lead screening (thanks NYC). The techs were so incompetent and rude I decided I wasn&#039;t go to allow it. At which point the informed me that I had to. I didn&#039;t know whether I should laugh at them or yell at them so I just walked away. <br /><br />Down the street at Broadway and 23rd Street, we go to Dr Matos who my wife and I really love. The facility ain&#039;t great, but she makes up for it.
