				So I&#039;ll be leaving on a jet plane Friday for a glorious vacay and wanted to see if any of you astorians had any great must-not-miss recommendations. I want to go to the Getty to see the architecture, but I thought you guys might know some stuff I don&#039;t!

				Universal Studios is always fun - Maybe you&#039;d be good for Fear Factor :evil:<br /><br />Maybe a side trip to Catalina Island - The Beaches are great - Venice and Santa Monica are recommended&nbsp; Definitly rent a car you&#039;ll need it.<br /><br />Have a great time!

				If you&#039;ll be renting a car just drive north up Highway 1 as far as you can. The scenery is spectacular along the coastline, especially at Big Sur-north of San Luis Obispo, where the Hearst Castle is located. <br />Of course, just sitting on a beach in California at sunset and watching the sun go down is real nice too! You will be at the western-most edge of the continent, you know. HAVE A GREAT TIME!

				Downtown LA can sorta be looked at as similar as Midtown/Downtown NYC, but then again slightly different.&nbsp; Tall buildings, it has...&nbsp; It also has a Jewelry District that is much more prominent than NYC.

				I&#039;m in LA right now! (Well, Long Beach, now.) My sister and her husband live in Pasadena, where I was yesterday, then today we stopped briefly in Koreatown to see where she works, then went to Santa Monica. Spent the afternoon on the pier (cool, not crowded on a Wednesday afternoon), and on the 3rd St. promenade. It&#039;s sorta like the South St Seaport, but about 10 times larger, and not as historical. Now I&#039;m in a hotel, facing away from the beach, preparing for 3 1/2 days of mostly work...<br /><br />Oh, and apparently, downtown LA is fine during the day, but at night it&#039;s deserted, like downtown NYC used to be, and somewhat dangerous.
