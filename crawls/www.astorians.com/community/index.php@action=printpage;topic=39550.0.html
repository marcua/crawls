				Hey all,<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve been living in Astoria for about 4 1/2 years now and love it. Currently living right near the Broadway stop but considering moving to the Ditmars/upper Ditmars area. I&#039;ve done a little looking on craigslist but I feel like I don&#039;t see as much on there in terms of housing in that area. What&#039;s the best way to find a place around there? Would love to find a 1BR or 2BR in a two family home, ideally with driveway parking. Of course I&#039;d like to avoid a broker fee, but is a broker the best way to find something like this? Any suggestions?<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />Emily

				I think a broker is the easiest and fastest way to find an apartment.&nbsp; That&#039;s how I found my apartment 22 years ago

				Try walking on a nice day, up and down the various side streets.&nbsp; I imagine you&#039;ll encounter a resident or two coming or going&nbsp; from their house or car.&nbsp; Approach in a very friendly way, asking if they happen to know of anyone in the nabe that might be looking to rent an apartment.<br /><br />There are also some small, older apt buildings that typically list the name and phone number of the in-house property manager (no broker fee) and/or the building Super&#039;s info.&nbsp; That&#039;s another way to try and contact a building owner/manager directly to ask about vacancies.&nbsp; In such buildings there obviously won&#039;t be driveway parking for you but then, you could always consider getting rid of your car.&nbsp; (With the MTA, taxis, Uber, Zipcar, etc., you can easily manage.&nbsp; It&#039;s an adjustment for car-owners, but eventually very freeing to not have to deal with car expenses, parking, shoveling, etc.)<br /><br />You can also check here for a list of Astoria buildings, and contact info/rental availability....&nbsp; You will have to call these places often though, as newly-available apartments will constantly be becoming available...<br /><br />https://www.nybits.com/queens/astoria/<br /><br />
