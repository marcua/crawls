				Hi everybody, they replaced the bathroom at my place but never got around to putting up the new ceiling lamp (which i have)&nbsp; I started playing around with it but stopped for fears of being electrocuted since i do not really know what i am doing.<br /><br />Any electrician or person out there that knows how to wire and install these things?&nbsp; Right now there is just a lightbulb hanging down with the 3 little wires with caps on them.&nbsp; Any info on a contact and price will be greatly appreciated!<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Sambarella

Do you know if the fixture your using will drawn too much amperage over the size wire in the house? Do you know that cloth insulation on the wire needs to be changed and reinsulated? Did you know that its not just black and white and thats why thousands of houses go on fire. Yes its because dumb assholes like your self think its simple and an idiot can do it. This is people lives at risk here. Go ahead and practice without a license and see what happends when you start your very own fire! I know I&#039;m not a doctor... but then again a doctor doesn&#039;t have to work for seven years before they can even think about getting there own license. Please stop with the electrical advice. Stick with fixing screen doors and painting.

				My problem is that I am burning through light bulbs incredibly fast in my kitchen overhead fixture.&nbsp; I just replaced them a month ago and they are already burnt out.&nbsp; This was happening frequently enough that I stopped buying the dollar store bulbs and swtiched to GE. Last time I even decided to buy the $5 light bulb that is supposed to last for 5 years (based upon 4 hrs per day of use) and after a month it is already burned out.&nbsp; <br /><br />Even if I use the light 24 hours a day (which I don&#039;t) that should still give me 300 days of use.<br /><br />Is there something wrong with the fixture?

Something like a recessed fixture with thermal insulation behind it?&nbsp; Or using a higher wattage bulb than the fixture is designed for? If this is the case, maybe a compact fluorescent bulb would give the light you crave without the problem.<br /><br />Poor contact between the socket and the bulb? If the thing flickers or dims for no reason, or makes little sounds when it&#039;s operating, there could be a poor connection socket-to-bulb, or in the wiring, or a faulty switch.<br /><br />Abnormally low voltage or use of a dimmer can shorten the life of halogen type bulbs - the process that makes them &quot;long-life&quot; depends on maintaining a particular range of operating temperature.<br /><br />Abnormally high voltage. A symptom might be that the light gets brighter when some appliance like the refrigerator switches on. This would be unusual, and indicate a serious flaw in the wiring that had better be corrected.<br /><br />Actually, any of these problems need to be corrected.

				Thanks for the ideas.&nbsp; I have two 75 watt bulbs in there now.&nbsp; Could it be that those are too high?&nbsp; How would I know?<br /><br />I have not noticed any of the things you mentioned like dimming/brightening when the fridge goes on or any noises when the light is operating.<br /><br />Though I do notice the fridge making weird noises sometimes, but I didn&#039;t think this would affect the operation of the lights.<br /><br />For a light that I use probably most of the day every day, maybe regular bulbs won&#039;t last longer than a month?&nbsp; Maybe this is normal?&nbsp; In all the other places I have lived, I have spent most of the day out of the house whereas here I spend most of the day in the house - so maybe it&#039;s just par for the course?<br /><br />Though I really can&#039;t explain the 5-year bulb expiring after a month - that one doesn&#039;t make sense.

				It may sound dumb but checking the voltage of both phases of electricity coming into your apartment may help.<br /><br />Should be 120 +/- 10 volts on both, normally one circuit breaker next to another represents each phase.<br /><br />Had a problem with one phase, half the lights in the apartment were dim, only took ConEd two months to correct.<br /><br />If the voltage is too high &gt; 120 volts it could cause the problem you are describing, but would most likely be a ConEd vs apartment issue.<br /><br />Good luck, PM with any specific questions.

Sockets for higher wattage bulbs are typically made of porcelain ceramic material, and have wires with high temperature insulation. <br /><br />High wattage fixtures are designed to allow air circulation around the fixture. If the fixture is enclosed and essentially flat against the ceiling, its probably intended for 60 W bulbs.<br /><br />Fixtures of recent manufacture will have a sticker in there too, though maybe that is all burned up by now. :)<br /><br /><br />A normal run-of-the-mill light bulb has an expected life of 750 hours average. If it&#039;s on 24 hours a day, that&#039;s about 31 days. <br /><br /><br />The 5 year bulb is a mystery.&nbsp; Some specialty bulbs are designed for a particular orientation - the box or bulb may something like &quot;Base down to horizontal&quot;, meaning it shouldn&#039;t be used in a fixture where the socket base is above the body of the bulb.<br /><br />Dimmers and certain automatic-timer switches do not play well with ordinary compact fluorescent bulbs.<br /><br /><br />The suggestion to find (someone with) a voltmeter is a good one. It is possible, after all the stuff con-ed had to replace last year, that they have made a mistake and the voltage to your house is just plain high.
