				I didn&#039;t think I had a problem, but apparently I do. I am cleaning my house today, and realized that I have been storing a ridiculous amount of empty boxes...all the boxes from my china, stemware, plates, dishes, silverware, and it must have accumulated to about 100 EMPTY boxes. Put this into the context of Astoria Queens closet space, it just doesn&#039;t make sense, yet here I am, lamenting the loss of each box as I pack it p for recycling. So a couple of questions. <br /><br />Does anyone have this need to save boxes?<br /><br />And, if I have boxes from my stemware, saved with all the bubble wrap and cardboard in place for my next move, whenever that may be, should I keep it, or dump it as it is not worth it and I&#039;ll buy more when the time comes to move...I really really really need advice on this. It feels so wrong just to thrown them away. <br /><br />They just look so nice....

				I have the same problem.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been working to learn to pitch things, but I tend to let my place get a bit cluttered saving things.&nbsp; I was saving boxes for my next move until I&#039;d been in the apartment for over a decade and decided I was being silly, though it was still hard for me to pitch them and I didn&#039;t manage to get rid of them all.

				I&#039;ve been here for almost five years, and the amount of boxes is comical. I&quot;m throwing away most of them now, but it is breaking my heart ( In know, doctor mend thyself) and I&#039;m checking the board in case someone is telling me &quot;DON&#039;T DO IT!!&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;m saving the stemware boxes for last...um...just in case.

				Oh I have the exact opposite problem. I don&#039;t keep any boxes. I have no storage space to keep them. But my biggest reason that I don&#039;t keep cardboard boxes is that roaches eat cardboard- so I really try to limit the amount of cardboard in my house. I am a totally roach-a-phobic.

				Big time!! Thats why when you get boxes to move- its a really good idea to check the inside of the boxes really well - lots of times they lay their eggs in the boxes.&nbsp; Plus they eat the cardboard. But that being said- I think they eat pretty much anything. I keep everything in clear storage containers just to be safe.

				I&#039;ve never seen a roach in my house but I always thought the reason there were roaches in boxes is that the boxes may have been used to store food, and remnants attract the roaches, but not enough to risk it. <br /><br />I&#039;ve tossed about 50 boxes now, as I look lovingly at my wine glass boxes...what to do?

				Alexa I am amazed that you had enough storage space for 50 boxes to begin with. I am impressed! We have no storage space in our apartment, no coat closet, no linen closet, barely any cabinets in the kitchen!

				You might consider offering them for a $$ or free because lots of people move and boxes are unnecessarily expensive. We picked up a lot of boxes this way for our last move from Craig&#039;s list this way. Saved us a bundle.&nbsp; :lol:

				I couldn&#039;t believe it either. When we first moved in we didn&#039;t have enough stuff, so I figured I&#039;d save then, and hid them up high in just about every closet. <br /><br />I&#039;m happy to say I am down to 8 wine boxes (you will have to pry them from my cold dead hands), and two china boxes. I may get scolded when my husband gets home that we still have them, but he won&#039;t be able to deny the progress. <br /><br />I&#039;ve also dumped four garbage bags of clothing I haven&#039;t worn in at least three years. And three crates worth of junk that has accumulated. Some of it is cool stuff, but just no room. <br />

				Edava - they aren&#039;t like moving boxes...a lot of plate boxes from my dinner plates (each place setting came in a box and I saved all twelve). But thanks for the heads up. <br /><br />With each post, I sound more like a lunatic.

				I know you love the boxes, but honestly..who cares about them.&nbsp; You have something better..the actual product.&nbsp; Why look at stemware on a box when you can go look at the real thing.&nbsp; I know you think I am being harsh, but I have learned over time.&nbsp; I used to be a big time pack rat and kept everything.&nbsp; I have learned to throw things out and not hold onto things I don&#039;t need.&nbsp; Space in Astoria is precious.&nbsp; Why clutter it with things not needed.&nbsp; Enjoy your things that are sitting on the shelves, not the boxes.<br /><br />R.I.P stemware boxes

				whatever you decide to do&nbsp; (didn&#039;t read the whole thread) make sure you recycle properly.&nbsp; &nbsp;your super or whoever is responsible for your garbage where you live will appreciate it.

				I know...I dumped them all.<br /><br />The clothes - when I said dumped, I meant got rid of...I always give them to a women&#039;s shelter on astoria blvd.<br /><br />Regarding recycling - its my house, so besides the whole environmental thing, I don&#039;t want to get ticketed. <br /><br />It isn&#039;t that I&quot;m attached to the boxes really, I just keep thinking, should I save them so I can pack the glasses easier later...I don&#039;t know. <br /><br />I&quot;m surprised no one else has this problem with keeping boxes.

				I used to keep a few boxes above my kitchen cabinets, until one day while cleaning them away, I noticed the bugs in them.&nbsp; Most were dead, and that was where the moths (that sometimes fly into my apartment if I leave the door open) would hide as well.&nbsp; I don&#039;t keep boxes up there anymore, and only keep my computer ones, and those are under my bed.&nbsp; I sincerely hope there are no bugs in those!

				I keep those also...but at least they are easier to store, and useful quickly. <br /><br />I also don&#039;t like throwing away pretty and sturdy ones, like for example, I have three boxes that sake sets came in, all black with japanese writing on them. I have no use for them, but I feel like one day i might...
