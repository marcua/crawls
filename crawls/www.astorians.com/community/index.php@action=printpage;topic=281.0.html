				I have a glass tabletop (just the glass) that I'm not going to use. I originally thought I'd make a table out of it, but I just can't find the creative energy or time. It's 4 feet in diameter and 1/2 inch thick. It has beveled edges so it is basically ready to be put on a tabletop. You could also put it over your existing round table. This glass was over $150 when it was made.

				Hi, is the table top still available? <br /><br />We have a wrought-iron table with a formica/wood top that we incautiously left out on the porch last winter; by spring it had split and curled up, leaving us with the table legs. <br /><br />Where are you located? We're at 29th St and 21st Ave with no car.

				Greetings,<br /><br />I'm at 29th st and Ditmars. So looks like it's just one block away. It is still available.<br /><br />It's really heavy though so you might need some help. I'll PM you with my phone number so you can give me a call.

				shoot.<br />I just measured our old table (should have done this before) - it is only 3 ft. wide. your tabletop would take up most of our porch width. I'm so sorry, it's not going to work after all... and it seemed so perfect.<br />thanks for getting back to me, and I hope you find it a good home.

				No problem. I hope I find a home for it too. I hate to just throw it away.<br /><br />Update in price. This is now FREE! I would rather give it to someone who can use it than throw it away.

				I'm racking my brains trying to think how I could use it, because it sounds classy. &nbsp;Unfortunately I am not a classy person and have no classy items, so it would really clash with my life.<br /><br />there should totally be a white elephant sale for those of who have stockpiled stuff we can't use but which is too cool to throw away. &nbsp;<br /><br />When spring gets here and there are street fairs again, all we would need is a bit of sidewalk space and maybe a table or two to barter, give and spend. &nbsp;Think of the landfill space we'd spare, the goodwill and community generated by great bargains, the henna tattoos and all the tea we'd drink trying to stay cool in the summer heat.

				We'd love it if anyone would take it. Anyone? Anyone? We'd rather that any one of you than us have it (because it is not being used, and right now it's just in the way). Please. I beg of you. Take the round tabletop.<br /><br />*And please note that you'll probably need a couple of burlymen to get it out of here, because well, it's just too damn heavy for anyone else. You can roll it fairly easily without the aid of burlymen, but stairs are the main problem.<br /><br />Please take it. &nbsp;:cry:
