				I recently bought the Reeses that is more peanut butter than chocolate.&nbsp; It was <em>yummy</em>.&nbsp; I&#039;m looking at their website - maybe it was the White Chocolate.<br /><br />Oh, and I had bought two of the muffins, the 2nd for next day&#039;s breakfast.&nbsp; I heated it in the oven, which was nice, but I think it would have been better if I had sliced it and toasted it under the broiler.&nbsp; If you do the broiler, you have to check it often because toasty goes to burnt very quickly.

				I never had DD&#039;s pumpkin latte until this thread motivated me to go try one. Now I&#039;ve had three this week. A couple of things I noted - the hot latte is much better than the iced, and for some reason the DD on east 55th serves a better one than the DD in the 53rd st. subway station. <br /><br />Thank you all for helping me discover a new addiction!&nbsp; :-D

				How does it compare to Starbucks&#039;? I had a delicious pumpkin spice latte from a coffee shop in Lancaster, PA, last week, and then yesterday I got one from Starbucks that was disappointing. I&#039;ve always felt theirs is too sweet unless you get it with the whipped cream and an extra shot of espresso, which seems excessive to me, but not a whole lot of coffee shops have pumpkin spice lattes to begin with. And I do love a good pumpkin spice latte.
