				Gleasons is opening soon! They tore off the paper early this week and have &quot;opening soon&quot; signs on the windows.&nbsp; For those of you who haven&#039;t had the pleasure of walking past it for months...it&#039;s on Broadway between 33rd and 34th and looks like an upscale Irish pub.&nbsp; I&#039;m dying to check it out as it looks awesome inside.&nbsp; Let&#039;s support it as its obviously been a struggle for them to get everything up and running!

				How you get a neg nod for coming here and saying a neighborhood enterprise is finally opening for business is beyond me.&nbsp; In the eye teeth of a recession I&#039;m sure this establishment means local jobs.&nbsp; I sure hope this wasn&#039;t a hickup of the software.

				Thanks for the support Cannibal!&nbsp; If you notice I&#039;ve got a low # of posts because I find it insulting to get neg. nods when I try really hard to just post things that are helpful/supportive to people in the neighborhood.&nbsp; I can only assume that the neg nod came from a competitor or someone who lives near Gleasons and isn&#039;t looking forward to the possibility of additional noise.<br /><br />

				Everybody&#039;s been walking past that place with the butcher paper over the glass and wondering, wondering, wondering what sort of headwind it was facing to get open.&nbsp; That doesn&#039;t mean we&#039;re all sitting back in a cheering section letting all comers open their doors.&nbsp; Their caption &quot;Fine Food and Spirits&quot; has to be literal.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want what was there in the recent past.&nbsp; I want people who&#039;ll consume completed meals instead of just libations.&nbsp; &nbsp;A neighborhood doesn&#039;t survive on just firewater or insurance sales alone, ya know.&nbsp; If they&#039;re responsible merchants who will be sensitive to that stretch of Broadway in the way they conduct themselves, then every other establishment there will benefit.

				&nbsp; The delay in opening was because of a burglary they had there a while back, and in difficulty in getting a liquor license, probably because of what went on there when it was Nubar, or because the owner used a lawyer to get a license.&nbsp; You don&#039;t need a lawyer to get one, and it usually takes longer because the lawyer drags their ass to pump up their fee.

				I had an English teacher in 7th grade named Mr. Gleason, and he was Greek, as I recall -- I think his first name was Alexander. Anyway, he had a paddle; it was probably a cricket bat, or slightly smaller. Talk in his class, and he&#039;d introduce you to the &quot;board of education&quot; right in front of everybody.<br /><br />If I go to this bar, you can bet I will be well behaved.<br />

				Gleason&#039;s was open tonight with their front windows/doors wide open, which is one of the reasons I stopped in. The free buffet is meant to be a preview for their menu which will be ready some time next week. They had buffet basics like chicken wings, chili, potatoes, pasta, etc. Saw some other people eating steak and potatoes. The staff was really friendly and the drinks were decent prices. I am not a beer drinker, but they do have Magner&#039;s on tap. Definitely stop in and give this new place a try!

				This place is really great!&nbsp; I went by for a drink tonight and it was pretty packed.&nbsp; The bar is huge and there&#039;s lots of room.&nbsp; The buffet is still going and the chili was awesome.&nbsp; It&#039;s nice to have a wide variety of choices to go to in the Broadway area now.&nbsp; If only Ditmars could get another irish pub, we&#039;d be all set.

				&nbsp; Nice, pleasant atmosphere, spacious, plenty of tv&#039;s, great food at the buffet (I second Daisy&#039;s praise for the chili!), and the waitresses and bartenders were so friendly and efficient.&nbsp; The owner was there, and he is such a gentleman.&nbsp; He put alot of money, sweat and tears into the place, and he seems to know exactly what kind of a place he wants to run.&nbsp; I think this could very well be my new spot, along with Gilbey&#039;s of course!&nbsp;

				it&#039;s buffet (and it&#039;s good) only until they roll out the menu. it&#039;d be cool if they made like the pubs in maspeth and did a once a week buffet. but if the buffet is any indication of the proper menu i am going to be happy to hand them my money.<br />john wasn&#039;t too thrilled with his guiness as a heads up. <br />I really liked the space, but i think they could do with one or 2 more tables in the front bar area otherwise seating space goes fast. the music was a bit loud when we were there on sunday but it wasn&#039;t unbearable.<br />i believe this is my new fave neighborhood spot&nbsp; :smitten:

				I stopped in this evening with my girlfriend and her mom/sister... it is definitely large with a lot of potential, but even with the bar area roughly half full, it felt kind of cramped.&nbsp; I&#039;m hoping they add more seating in the empty areas.&nbsp; The menu looked good, though I&#039;m wondering if it will be expanded (it was only one large menu page).&nbsp; I would not be surprised if this were not the final version of the menu, mostly due to the number of typos in it (mashed potatos, french fires, masculine salad, wings 6/6.95 4/12.95 &lt;- I&#039;m not even sure what this means).&nbsp; I&#039;m also hoping that they&#039;ll put up a beer menu somewhere, because on a crowded night it&#039;s going to be tough to get close enough to read them off the taps.<br /><br />Overall, as we all know it&#039;s very nice and large.. and it&#039;s been pretty busy lately.&nbsp; I hope the operators continue to be as serious about this place as those of us in the neighborhood!&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t too impressed (though the interior is VERY well done), but hopefully they&#039;re still working on getting things finalized.

				Just got back from my first visit there and will definitely be going back.&nbsp; We went for dinner and the food portions are outrageous for what you pay, service was very good.&nbsp; I had a burger which was cooked just right and tasted terrific.&nbsp; I always felt Broadway Station&#039;s burgers were a little salty, but Gleason&#039;s was just right.&nbsp; They had two different Hofbrau beers on tap (I tried them both) and they were served in a proper Hofbrau glass which was a small pleasure after having been to the actual Hobrau house in Munich.&nbsp; All in all,&nbsp; two thumbs up for Gleason&#039;s.&nbsp; :)

				We went tonight.<br /><br />This place was awful.<br /><br />First, they did not have three of the beers on their menu and the waiter didn&#039;t know until he checked at the bar each and every time. Then, with the Fish &amp; Chips entree, they did not serve the chips until we had a lengthly conversation with one of the servers about the fried fish being the &quot;fish&quot; and the french fries being the &quot;chips&quot;. The food was also severely sup-par. I didn&#039;t expect fabulous food, but the fish was clearly frozen. In some places, that would be understandable for a pub, but several bars in Astoria have fresh fish in their Fish &amp; Chips (like Sunswick). Finally, they waited to let us know that their credit card machine was down until we got our bill and put out our card.<br /><br />The final straw was that we were very clearly unhappy with this appalling service and the owner or manager avoided eye contact with us as he brought bottles of sambuca to his friends at the table next to ours.<br /><br />I understand that this is a pub and I don&#039;t expect four-star service or anything resembling it, but I did not except such an awful disappointment. I will not be patronizing this establishment again, which is a shame, given the beautiful decor and great location.

Such a fun, relaxed, and clean place, my BF and I plan to make a weekly date to catch Yanks games. It was also karaoke night...but we left before anything tragic, such as me singing, happened.<br /><br />Didn&#039;t get any food but was tortured by the couple next to me eating some ungodly-delicious looking fried plate of goodness next to me.
