				There is an incredible snow globe on the lawn of a house on 24th ave. between 24th st. and Crescent st.&nbsp; It is a giant inflatable snow globe, with a big snowman inside - and snow blowing around everywhere.&nbsp; It&#39;s totally rad.&nbsp; Check it out!

				That does sound fantastic.&nbsp; All anyone ever used to put up in my parents&#39; neighborhood were those white reindeer that look like cardboard cutouts - the only fun there was watching the results when someone took it upon themselves to rearrange the reindeer into mating positions.

				The Peanuts inflatable snow globe was deflated this morning - I passed it on the way to the subway (24th ave. btw. 24th and Crescent).&nbsp; It was a pretty depressing sight - Snoopy collapsed in a pile of white foam pellets (the ersatz &quot;snow&quot;) with the roof of the globe caving in on his head, Woodstock nowhere to be seen, probably suffocating to death deep in the recesses of a folded plastic and rubber abyss.&nbsp; The fact that it was like 70 degrees out and shpritzing rain made everything a bit more sad.&nbsp; To give you an idea of the shape of the deflated globe- it looked like one of those leather basketballs from the 1930&#39;s that is in the trophy case in the gym of my NCAA Division III alma mater.<br /><br />I&#39;d rather not post pictures of somebody&#39;s lawn ornaments on this page - I wouldn&#39;t want some anonymous person taking pictures of my apartment and putting them on the web for no good reason; I think their privacy should be respected a little bit.

				Now three or four other houses on that block (24th ave. btw 24th and Crescent) are all decked out in full regalia.&nbsp; It is quite a sight to behold at night - every square inch of house-front for a good two thirds of a block is occupied by a lit-up Christmas light or decoration of some sort.&nbsp; It&#39;s sort of like if you took my whole childhood block in the burbs where I grew up, and crammed all the houses into a quarter of the space, and then plugged them in.&nbsp; And if you&#39;re walking west, home from the subway, you see all of this with the Triboro bridge all lit up in the back.&nbsp; And then you realize that only a few short blocks ago, you passed by the Beer Garden.&nbsp; And then you love Astoria.

				29th St bw 21 Ave and Ditmars.&nbsp; One house is lit up from roof to yard full of lighting and lawn ornaments.&nbsp; I think this one bought the store out!&nbsp; Light&#39;s up the whole street.&nbsp; It&#39;s so tacky but I love it&nbsp; &nbsp;:lol:<br /><br />Oh and there&#39;s a globe across the street with a penguin and a Snowman standing together with snow blowing all over them.<br /><br />And yeah, this reminds me of the burbs too.&nbsp; My street a few blocks up from there is full of lights as well.&nbsp; It&#39;s so holiday spirit!

Basically, if you can see it from a public space (as a sidewalk or a street is), you can do what you want with it, EXCEPT if you want to sell it (and even then, if you can prove you shot it for artistic reasons, and you sold it as fine art, you don&#39;t need a release. But that&#39;s something else entirely). If it were for commercial gain, that would be an entirely different matter (and you would need a property release, I believe). But for something like this, its a non-issue. This is how paparrazi can hide in trees next door to a famous person&#39;s house and shoot them sunbathing in their backyard. They can sell them to celebrity rags because they&#39;re the &quot;press&quot; (freedom of press), but they wouldn&#39;t be able to make a poster or calendar of it and sell it at the mall. I know the local paper back home does a spread on decorations (and publishes street names and a map for those who want to drive around and see the best displays in town), and when I asked a lawyer who visited my photo business class (I&#39;m at SVA) about it a couple weeks ago, she said it was completely legal, even if they didn&#39;t ask permission.<br /><br />All the law babble aside...ethically, I&#39;d say if its out in the front yard or on the front of the house, then its fair game. However, just to be decent, if you really want to put pictures here, you should knock on the door and let them know. I probably would, and if they&#39;re not home, I might leave a note on the door with my name and email or something. If they&#39;re not cool with it, you can still do whatever you want with it (except make it into postcards or posters to sell...you can even use it as your personal Christmas card next year, that&#39;s within your rights), but you might feel bad.

				Yeah, I was less concerned with legal issues of right-to-privacy, and more concerned with keeping this thread within the bounds of good taste.&nbsp; I don&#39;t want to be the person responsible for posting pics of neighborhood peoples&#39; houses for the purpose of exposing them to mockery.&nbsp; I don&#39;t want to be perceived as coming into this neighborhood and making fun of peoples&#39; Christmas decorations.&nbsp; But hey, the paparazzi are nice respectable fellows, right?

Of course, if they don&#39;t speak English (you didn&#39;t mention), that could be a problem. But even then, walking by a few times over the course of a couple weeks, waving hi, and then stopping by one time with a camera and doing a charades version of &quot;can I take your picture?&quot; will probably get you your shot.<br /><br />Ok! back to twinkly lights!!!&nbsp; :lol: I love twinkle.
