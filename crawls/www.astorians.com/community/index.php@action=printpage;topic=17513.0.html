				So I&#039;m dropping off dry cleaning and see that Capital One Bank on the corner of Broadway and 32nd is taped off by the police.&nbsp; First thought I had was ...Bank robbery?&nbsp; &nbsp;Sure enough, Gothamist is reporting that they had a robbery today.&nbsp; Crazy thing is that there were a few reports on Gothamist about bank robberies throughout the city.&nbsp; We have also had a few bank robberies throughout Astoria the past year or so.&nbsp; I know some might argue it&#039;s the economy but seriously, who the hell thinks they can rob a bank and get away with it these days???

				yeah, a surprisingly large amount of people get away with it.&nbsp; 25% is a pretty high success rate, especially if you consider that many of the thieves try multiple times.&nbsp; I read somewhere a while ago that the increase might have something to do with the lack of armed security guys in banks these days.&nbsp; Before the bulletproof glass shields you always used to see an armed guard at the door.&nbsp;

Are you sure it&#039;s not a 75% success rate? Wow, remind me never to take up bank robbery. I believe that most crimes have <em>arrest </em>rates <em>below </em>25%, and conviction rates rather less than that. (Google...) Yeah, that&#039;s right (http://crime.about.com/od/stats/a/ucr_property.htm). <br /><br />Incidentally, Harper&#039;s Magazine this month reprints a sermon in which a reverend in the UK advocates shoplifting (not robbery) as the last resort. (Subscription required (http://www.harpers.org/archive/2010/03/0082850)...) Interesting reading.

				My sister is a manager of a BofA branch in California and a branch she had just been transferred from was robbed several months ago.&nbsp; Right before she left, she was suspicious of a few men who were very obviously casing the bank and its security.&nbsp; She even alerted the higher-ups, but no one took her seriously.&nbsp; A week or two later, that branch was robbed and the guys got over $50,000.&nbsp; Luckily, they had the faces of the guys on camera from when they cased the branch.&nbsp; Anyway, the execs don&#039;t seem too concerned about robberies because, as Speebs said, they&#039;re insured.

				They&#039;re insured and instructed to give the money over to the robbers because it would be a PR nightmare to have the robbers take hostages or shoot anyone.&nbsp; Does anyone know if Washington Mutual&#039;s (RIP) tellers-don&#039;t-have-access-to-money system works?&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t imagine how to steal money from them.&nbsp; The tellers never touch the money.&nbsp; <br /><br />Alison, we have a getaway car (thanks, Mac) and genre of film.&nbsp; Now all we need are some pantyhose and a big sack with a giant dollar sign on it.

				My father just retired after a lifetime in the banking industry. He was really impressed back in the day (sixties) by the guy whose life was made into the film &quot;Catch Me if you Can.&quot; <br /><br />Among his loooooong list of other crimes, this guy (Abagnale) replaced the deposit slips at the bank with ones that had his account number on them, then cashed out after a week or so. <br /><br />He also rented a security guard uniform, and after hours, posted a sign on the night deposit box that said &quot;Out of Order- Leave deposits with security guard.&quot; He stood in the vestibule all night with a box, and in the morning, returned the uniform and walked off with all the cash. <br /><br />Maybe this gives you guys some ideas?&nbsp; :lol:

All these years of confusion about what to major in and random jobs...MagicPie, let&#039;s do some scheming....it&#039;s never too late to dream! We just need a soundtrack now. I&#039;m thinking Prodigy&#039;s &quot;Smack My B***h Up&quot; - we can have someone running behind us with a boom box of sorts...<br /><br />(I know the soundtrack defeats the purpose of the silent movie, but we are revolutionary.)

				That was one of my favorite movies. The story was so interesting, I got the book, convinced most of the stories were made up......turns out they were true! How much Abagnale embellished, though, makes me wonder....he was a professional scam artist after all, so what would stop him from stretching the truth about his own life story? But he sure was good at what he did, so ya never know.<br /><br />I would recommend you get the book if you can&#039;t get enough of the movie. It goes into sordid detail about the time he spent in French prison, what it was like to be freed.....fascinating. And you might want to familiarize yourself with prison life if this is the path on which you choose to embark&nbsp; :-D

				Thanks for the whole website of ideas, Jayme.&nbsp; An excellent website for research as Alison and I spiral toward a life of crime.<br /><br />Alison, in silent movies, there was often a live piano player in the theater to provide music.&nbsp; We will simply have a DJ instead.&nbsp; Revolutionary.&nbsp; Like you said. <br /><br />I like &quot;Smack My B***h Up&quot; and also &quot;Run this Town&quot; by Jay-Z.&nbsp; But mostly because it gets stuck in my head.&nbsp; Once we are rolling around in money at our secret lair, I think the song should be, &quot;Eye of the Tiger.&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />I will now read &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; to get more in the mood.&nbsp;

				when i clerked for a judge, he always said that in his 30 years on the bench, he had never seen a bank robber get to the vault. &nbsp;That means that most bank robbers don&#039;t usually get much more $$ than they would get by robbing a liquor store. (the $50,000 mentioned above is far more than most bank robbers get). &nbsp;But, unlike robbing a liquor store, bank robbery is a federal crime. &nbsp;that means a federal prison, no parole, and MUCH longer sentences if you get caught. &nbsp;<br /><br />not that i am advocating anything, but the judge always advised that if a life of crime was in our future, there were better things to rob . . . &nbsp;:-D

Cops also canvassed the area in search of the suspect who apparently made a successful getaway.<br />Police are still searching for an armed bandit who struck the same Capital One branch on Oct. 31, 2009, also making off with an undisclosed amount of cash.<br />The suspect in the February 27 holdup is described as a white or light-skinned Hispanic male, 25 to 30 years old, approximately 5 feet, 8 inches tall and 140 pounds.<br />Police said the teller was shaken but no one was injured in the incident.<br />Anyone with information on the suspect is urged to call the Crimestoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS. A $2,000 reward is being offered to anyone with information leading to the arrest and conviction of the suspect.
