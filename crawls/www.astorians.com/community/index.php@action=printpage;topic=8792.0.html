				I went there yesterday to buy a camcorder. I found the selection, but they were all bolted to the display which made it difficult to look at the merchandise.&nbsp; A salesman approached and I asked if there was a way I could actually hold the product that I was looking at and he said there was no way.&nbsp; Now these items are in two or three tiered rows and the one I wanted was on the inside top tier so it wasn&#039;t directly in front of me.&nbsp; When I told him that I was a little uneasy buying an item that I couldn&#039;t hold, he shrugged his shoulder and walked away.&nbsp; I found the manager, George, and let him know that I wanted to buy a camcorder but needed to be able to see it up closely and he told me there was no way. <br /><br />&nbsp;If ever I need to buy something that I can get within our neighborhood, I will always make a point to do so, and that&#039;s why it&#039;s so frustrating that this store was so uncaring and not accommodating to a request that I think is fairly reasonable. <br /><br />Thanks for allowing me to vent.&nbsp; Anyone know of another place I can buy a camcorder in Astoria?

				There&#039;s always the best buy on Northern and 50 (or so) and a number of no name electronics stores on Steinway.&nbsp; I have rarely had a good experience at PC Richards and it&#039;s always the same type of thing you just described.

				I agree PC Richards is the worst.&nbsp; Last year, I was buying two laptops for work.&nbsp; I started off asking if they had them in stock and was told yes. Then went through the whole sale with the salesperson only to find out after I had paid that one was out of stock.&nbsp; Ended up having to drive to the Queens Blvd.&nbsp; store to pick up my item.&nbsp; The manager and salesperson could care less that they were putting me out of my way or that they lied to me to get the sale.&nbsp; If I didn&#039;t need the laptops right away for work, would have returned both of them.&nbsp; &nbsp;:x&nbsp; KidMurdock is right, Best Buy is a better option, their customer service is much better even though its a chain.&nbsp;

				It&#039;s worth supporting local shops when they deserve your support. In my experience, PC isn&#039;t one of those places. <br /><br />Try B&amp;H Photo or Adorama in Manhattan. Both pro (and amateur), internationally-known photo shops that would find it as crazy as you did to not allow someone to hold a camera before buying. And employees who know what they&#039;re talking about, and can likely point you at a better choice (not necessarily a more expensive one either).<br /><br />B&amp;H is quite a spectacle actually, and worth visiting almost just to see it, though that means big crowds often. Adorama is smaller and cozier and a shorter walk from the train (unless you can easily get to the A/C/E at 34th). <br /><br />http://bhphoto.com/ <br />9th ave 33rd/34th street. N/R/W to 34th and a 5-10 min walk.<br /><br />http://www.adorama.com/<br />42 West 18th Street , N/R/W to 14th<br /><br />Note that since they&#039;re both run by orthodox jews their weekend is not the norm: they close Friday around noon and are closed Saturdays. But you don&#039;t have to be jewish to shop there ;-)<br /><br />If you know exactly what you want and don&#039;t need any advice, I imagine a BB or CC would be fine.<br />

				I think B&amp;H would be your best bet - I&#039;ve used Adorama for some of my photo supply stuff, but I think their sales staff leaves a bit to be desired (especially this time of year), and since it&#039;s smaller, you might be waiting around forever for service (I know I&#039;ve waited around forever in the middle of the year).<br /><br />Also, a plus when it comes to buying at B&amp;H - A friend just got a job there (as a salesperson on the floor) and told me that their sales people DO NOT work on commission because management wants them to be honest, rather than selling someone who might not know the difference the more expensive thing. They actually care about their reputation (imagine that!) He said that honestly in selling is one of their big things, which is nice to hear.<br /><br />It seems like it would take FOR-EV-ER to get to from Astoria (they&#039;re at 9th and 33rd), but if you can get to Queens Plaza (via the R or V or whatever), take the E to 34th street, and it&#039;s a block from there. I did it once on a Sunday from Steinway &amp; 21 Ave (I took the bus down to Broadway), and it didn&#039;t take long at all.<br /><br />Also, I LOATHE PC Richards. I&#039;ve had to make a few trips there for little things like blank CDs or whatever (there was one near school), and even with that, I remember hating the place. I&#039;ve never had or heard of anyone having a good experience there, I&#039;m surprised they&#039;re still around, to be completely honest.

				The last 3 visits I made to PC Richards I left without purchasing anything, even though I went there to buy something. THey are either out of stock, or apathetic, or unprofessional. I recommend J&amp;R Music if you&#039;re interested in electronic like a camcorder.

				For anything in cameras you must cross the river and go to B and H.&nbsp; They are a huge store and have any camera equipment that you need.&nbsp; &nbsp;They have the best prices periods.&nbsp; Other camera stores do not post there prices until they see what B and H are going to charge.&nbsp; They also have great customer services and sales people.&nbsp; Believe me they are going to let you touch and play with the camera for as long as you want.&nbsp; Every professional photographer gets there equipment there.&nbsp; But they are just as happy to serve non professional too.<br />

				I have never had anything but pleasant experiences with PC. But, I would only use them for appliances. I always arrange to go there or call them when I know that one particular salesperson will be there. Her name is Nancy. I don&#039;t know her last name. I&#039;ve bought 2 refrigerators, a gas stove, a high-end front-load, under-counter washing machine, 2 microwave ovens, 2 low-end televisions, and 2 air conditioners. I was pleased both with the price and with their delivery and set-up. Most recently, when my refrigerator dropped dead, I went online to see what they had, called Nancy, and I had a new refrigerator in my kitchen overnight . . . and it was $250 less expensive than any other place. <br /><br />However, when it comes to anything that could be bought from B&amp;H, that&#039;s where I go. Not only is their floor staff extremely knowledgeable and professional, their telephone staff is the very best around. They talked me through setting up my first digital camera with a sense of humor and followed up a few days later to find out if there was anything else they could do. I&#039;ve also bought a high-end TV from them, 2 CD players, 2 DVD burner/players, and another high-end digital camera, to name a few of the things that I remember. I am not the touchy-feely kind of person, so I have no problem first checking with Consumer Reports and then going online and ordering something from B&amp;H. Their regular standard delivery via UPS arrives overnight. I especially love their open box or used items. Talk about cost effective!

				Whenever store employees work on commission, their customer service seems to be really horrible.&nbsp; I&#039;ve noticed it with Circuit City, Comp USA, and PC Richards.&nbsp; I&#039;ve always had good experiences at Best Buy and B &amp; H Photo.&nbsp; I usually buy most of my electronics online though.&nbsp; I check pricegrabber.com and cnet, and do a lot of research before choosing what I want.&nbsp; And then buy it wherever it&#039;s cheapest, which is usually online, without tax and free shipping.&nbsp; But B&amp;H and Best Buy often have good prices.

				I agree - Circuit City/PC Richards/Comp USA are terrible.&nbsp; Im really surprised that al three are still in business. It seems like most stores have been upgrading their customer service in the past couple of years, so its kind of strange that these three are still around. I once went to PC Richards to buy a TV and boy was that an adventure. I gave up and walked out the store bc I thought I was about to have a stroke with all the nonsense I had to go through in there. Sales Associates standing around like statues and pretty much being useless when you ask them about a product, and so on.&nbsp; <br /><br />Best Buy and BH deserve the great endorsements. Good customer service, lots of items in stock, etc... the whole deal. You never have some 20 year old following you around the store trying to convince you that they know all about the item you want to purchase. And when you ask them to give you more detail they are like &quot;um its just great&quot;.&nbsp; Its happened plenty of times. <br /><br />In general before I buy any electronics, I definately try to do some research on it on CNET, Amazon, Eopinions, etc&nbsp; first before going into the store and purchasing. That way if some associate trys to &quot;school you&quot; on the product, I can zing them with difficult questions about it

				Having spent&nbsp; :-o money at B&amp;H through the years, I&#039;d have to agree with all of the positive feedback about them on the board. I use them primarily for professional lighting and camera purchases (which I ship out of state to avoid the&nbsp; :-P taxes. For consumer stuff, they&#039;re pretty competitive, but several things count against them, not the least of which is NYC tax. <br /><br />Our local Best Buy (over on Northern) is pretty great, too. It will price match local stores, including B&amp;H, and it has a 30 day no questions asked return policy on most consumer electronics stuff, which is certainly superior to B&amp;H&#039;s. Best Buy may be a big chain, but there are only two of them in the city and we have one right here! Pretty cool. But, again with the :x taxes.<br /><br />Amazon is great for its prices, return policy, and the whole tax avoidance thing. Of course, you have to be around to pick it up, but if you sign up for Amazon&#039;s Prime shipping program and order from them frequently, you save a small fortune. Concerned about your dollars helping people locally? Well, the local delivery guy gains the business that you&#039;re not giving to the local store.&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />PC Richards... anyone else see that as a prime location for a HUGE Barnes and Noble? <br />&nbsp;

				I&#039;m pretty sure Circuit City dosen&#039;t work on comission anymore. But they did fire most of their veteran employees I think about 3000+ last spring because they made more then $13... so that can tell you what kind of direction they are going in and with their stock at amout $7 they&#039;re pretty much done.<br /><br />P.C. Richards is only good because they take away your old appliances. <br /><br />Hey how about The Wiz? Remember the one on Steinway and Broadway where you&#039;d buy your item first then have to go over to that elevator thing to actually pick it up only to find out they didn&#039;t have it or charged you for the wrong one?<br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;m not sure if they sell camcorders, but what about Radio Shack? There&#039;s the one<br />right by the Ditmars station and the other one on Steinway, a few doors down from<br />Duane Reade.<br /><br />Best Buy is great though. I have one near me on 23rd St. &amp; 6th Ave. It&#039;s always busy, <br />but the few times I&#039;ve gone in there, I&#039;ve always been able to find someone to answer a <br />question or just point me in the right direction of something. <br /><br />

				Another vote for B&amp;H. Great combination of service and good prices. The whole not open on Saturdays thing is a bit of a drag, but I&#039;ve managed to survive. J&amp;R is pretty good, although I don&#039;t think quite as good and park row is far (unless you are downtown for work/friends etc.)<br /><br />IMO, BB and CC are pretty much 6 of 1, 1/2 dozen of the other.

To this day I don&#039;t know the name of my favorite type of cookie, because I always got it from there, and like never knew the name cuz I was so young it didn&#039;t matter. And no bakery I&#039;ve ever bought them from since has known the name, either. It&#039;s crazy. They&#039;re kinda crispy and covered in chocolate.... oh man ... i want one ....<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=8792.msg103716.html#msg103716">Quote from: adamwc on December 03, 2007, 01:32:18 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">PC Richards... anyone else see that as a prime location for a HUGE Barnes and Noble? </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I DO I DO I DO!!!!!!! But we can all dream can&#039;t we? Personally, I went into that stupid place this summer to get an a/c, and it was HORRIBLE. The one I bought was so freaking loud I couldn&#039;t take it. I could hear it over my vacuum!! And they would NOT take it back. I told them it had to be defective, there&#039;s no way it&#039;s seriously that loud, and they said I had to contact Fredrick(sp? the brand ... of a/cs...) and they just wouldn&#039;t help and I HATE them!! Stupid-heads!

I bought 2 Friedrich air conditioners and one of them was far too noisy. I contacted the manufacturer and they sent someone over, found the problem and still removed and replaced (including and installation) the unit, all within 8 days. They both run extremely quietly and I love the way they save me money during those unbearable hot days when the energy saver button is depressed and maintain a steady temperature and humidity. I found their customer service to be so far above par that I wouldn&#039;t hesitate to purchase (replace) another unit should the need ever arise.

I traded my dad my noisy one for the one in his spare room. He doesn&#039;t work, so he would make it a project to try to fix it himself, you know. It worked out in the end. Although the one he gave me came with a remote, which I find absurd.

				The thing is not one sales person there knows a thing about electronics.&nbsp; It&#039;s sort of a game now when I go in.&nbsp; You see just how little they know about something.&nbsp; You realize they know crap, they just want to make the sale.&nbsp; Actually they don&#039;t even seem to care that much about the sale.<br /><br />Best buy is the place to go.&nbsp; The guys in the auto stereo section really know their stuff.&nbsp;
