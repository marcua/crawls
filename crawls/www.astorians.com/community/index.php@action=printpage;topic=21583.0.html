				We had lunch here this week.&nbsp; A hoe in the wall location with out of this world authentic Kansas BBQ.&nbsp; <br /><br />I had the two meat and two side platter.&nbsp; Burnt ends (brisket) and pork ribs.&nbsp; Both perfection but the burnt ends we just a bit better than that. Super moist and tender with a smokey finish. Really good stuff folks.&nbsp; My sides were coleslaw and baked beans.&nbsp; The slaw is vinegar based and finely shredded.&nbsp; A nice balance to the meats.&nbsp; The beans were a deep rich flavor, studded with bits of meat and surprisingly the whole thing was not overpowering in any way.&nbsp; A perfect side dish.&nbsp; The platter came with two slices of Texas toast (double think) white bread.&nbsp; The table was set with a roll of paper towel and a squeeze bottle of house bbq sauce, mmm mmm goodness.&nbsp; The Guys behind the place are alumni of Hill country and Dinosaur BBQ.&nbsp; <br /><br />People have complained about the so so fries and desserts.&nbsp; Personally I don&#039;t see a need for french fries at a smokehouse.&nbsp; The sodas were from a self serve fountain and there was no sweet or any house made iced tea.&nbsp; On the other had the place is just a month old so they get some slack here.&nbsp; The fact that the bbq and sides may be the best in NYC is good enough for me.

				Definitely get the beaked beans side.&nbsp; Truly amazing stuff.&nbsp; I asked Jared, the manager /bbq guy, what to eat for lunch and he suggested his favorites.&nbsp; Figured it was a good way to start my experience there.&nbsp; Go for lunch on the early side.&nbsp; When we got there at 2pm they ran out of burnt ends after my order.<br />

				This is the second great review I&#039;ve read about this place. I really need to check it out. In your estimation, is this the type of place that is lunch only, as they&#039;ll run out of stuff before dinner, or could one conceivably make it in for dinner as well?<br />Also, do they offer any beer options (even byo, because I find good BBQ goes great with cheap beer).

				Kid, good&nbsp; questions.&nbsp; Fist of all, they have no beer for now but encourage BYOB!&nbsp; As for food running out, Jared said the produce more for dinner.&nbsp; Maybe the rule should be get there early for now till they get a good fix on crowds and consumption.&nbsp; Something tells me they will be around for a long time or until they find a bigger location close by.&nbsp;

				Awesome. Good to know, since a number of the best smokehouses I&#039;ve been to are lunch only deals, since they start smoking at I don&#039;t know 2Am, and shut down when they run out. When I did the lockhart triple threat (Kreusz, Blacks, and Smittys) I remember Smitty&#039;s running out of certain things by the time we got there at 1 or so. Granted I had put away a disgusting amount of meat at that point, but I certainly took note.

				I seriously need to go back to Austin. I ate better in that town than almost anywhere else I have ever been. The only places that are even in contention are New Orleans and NYC. I&#039;m still shocked that I&#039;m not a 1,000 lb monster.

				This does look great, and right near our apt.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Reminds me of Pearsons (now called Rangers) in Jackson Heights - anyone ever been there? <br /><br />Did you happen to notice if they had highchairs at John Brown&#039;s?&nbsp; &nbsp;

				To follow up on my post above, we went there this weekend.&nbsp; Twice.&nbsp; &nbsp;Excellent meat.&nbsp; &nbsp;We had (keep in mind this is 2 trips):&nbsp; pork ribs, chicken, burnt ends, pulled pork, pork belly, collard greens, baked bean, mac and cheese and coleslaw. <br /><br />The meat was all tender and smokey, and as was mentioned here previously, the BBQ sauce was awesome.&nbsp; &nbsp;I really liked their baked beans and coleslaw.&nbsp; &nbsp;My husband really liked their collards.&nbsp; &nbsp;Not a big fan of the mac and cheese - but I like mine really cheesy and runny, and that&#039;s just not the style here.&nbsp; <br /><br />My one piece of advice to the owners would be to get 1 or 2 highchairs or booster seats - they seem to be kid friendly (maybe &quot;kid friendly&quot; is&nbsp; inherent in a BBQ place) but we forgot to bring our child seat and luckily our 2 year old was content to sit in his stroller for lunch - he usually isn&#039;t.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Went over the weekend and really enjoyed my pork belly sandwich.&nbsp; Took home a pound of burnt ends (brisket) and it was very good, almost as good as the moist brisket at Hill Country if anyone has tried that.&nbsp; <br /><br />Love having this in the neighborhood. I see myself getting off the train at 39th or 36th Ave and bringing food home on my way from work.&nbsp; Bit of an out-of -the way location (37th Avenue and Crescent) and a healthy hike from my apt, but if I want to consume pounds of meat I will need to walk it off somehow.<br /><br /><br />

				I wish they had collard greens when I went yesterday.&nbsp; Are they off the menu permanently?<br /><br />No one&#039;s mentioned the lamb sausage yet.&nbsp; A local Greek butcher makes it, and it&#039;s very juicy (nearly on the side of too fatty) and full of flavor.&nbsp; I personally enjoyed the fries, but I really like steak fries in general.&nbsp; They&#039;re also trying out smoked turkey; the sample I had was peppery and surprisingly moist.<br /><br />Do they plan to get a beer &amp; wine license, or are they too close to the school for that to happen?

				The french fries are public school system grade.<br />The ribs didnt really &quot;fall off bone&quot; ... but I have to agree - the taste is right. <br />That said - The burnt tip&#039;s are to die for! and deliver is super quick ~15-20 minutes. <br />

				I&#039;d have to agree with you on the fries.&nbsp; I was hoping for something other than store-bought frozen food item fries.&nbsp; I also didn&#039;t realize it&#039;s kind of a take out joint with seating.&nbsp; I honestly found the brisket and ribs pretty bland - I was expecting something with more spice.&nbsp; But it could certainly be that I&#039;m not familiar with smoked food so perhaps it&#039;s just not flavored with spices.

				Yes, I did.&nbsp; But I guess I was hoping that the meat would be flavorful on its own, so that the sauce would solely be a compliment to the food&#039;s taste.&nbsp; In this case, it was used to make it taste, I hate to say, edible.

				I spent the day thinking about the burnt ends and had to go back for the second day in the row. It&#039;s clearly their best cut!<br /><br />The white sliced bread is also my favorite side (and free!).<br /><br />The only way they wlll improve the quality of the food is to get higher traffic in that space. <br /><br />I went during dinner time and there was only 1 other couple sitting. <br /><br />So most of the cuts arent fresh out the oven and have been sitting in plastic wrap for most of the day.<br /><br />The potential of this place is huge.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				The ribs seemed a bit fatty but the pulled pork and burnt end sanwiches are really good. The sides need a bit of improvement.&nbsp; The fries were very average and I was surprised to see no corn on the cob available.&nbsp; The baked beans were delicious.&nbsp; Looking forward to returning.

				have to say I love the food here still and the owner is a great guy, but from now on I&#039;ll probably only eat there, they need to sort out their delivery. I have ordered from them 3 times and they have yet to get the order right, the last time I ordered they left out 3 sides, rather than bring them up they said all they could do was refund me.<br /><br /><br />not sure I would ever order delivery from them again, but I hope they get their act together.

				I ate there twice.&nbsp; Once to check it out, and was underwhelmed to say the least.&nbsp; And another time to give them a shot.&nbsp; Yeah the owner is cool in a country hoaky way, nut the ambiance of the store, and the fact that the sides, and yes the frozen fries were hyorrible, made me never go there again.&nbsp; When you use Restaurant Depot as your sole source of purveyor, this is the result.&nbsp; Great effort on bringing this cuisine to the neighbor hood, but bad business decisions are apparent everywhere in this place.&nbsp; And believe me it&#039;s not just the delivery.&nbsp; I prefer Butcher Bar located at 37-08 30th Avenue.&nbsp; www.Butcherbar.com (http://www.Butcherbar.com) Not only do they do a bang up job on the bbq, they only use the highest quality meats, from 100% grass fed beef, to heritage breed pork.&nbsp; Sustainabilty and business savvy and ethics.&nbsp; My support all the way!&nbsp; Sorry John Brown.

				I ate at John Brown&#039;s yesterday and I was EXTREMELY impressed.&nbsp; What a classy operation there.&nbsp; The brisket and burnt ends were DELICIOUS.&nbsp; Some of the best BBQ I&#039;ve ever had.&nbsp; The side I had were also out of this world -- sweet potato mash and collard greens (usually hard to make tasty).&nbsp; For those who complained about the fries on the board, I am happy to report that they are now made in-house like all of the other items, including the amazing apple cobbler.&nbsp; There are so many other types of meat to try with all of the regular menu items and specials.<br />&nbsp;<br />On top of the incredible food, the owner (former pitmaster at Hill Country) and his staff are very friendly and accomodating.&nbsp; There&#039;s music there Tuesday and Thursday evenings.&nbsp; I would encourage everyone to check out John Brown&#039;s on 37th Avenue at Crescent St.&nbsp; It&#039;s worth the trek.

				FINALLY made it here.&nbsp; Really really delicious.&nbsp; We had a pulled pork sandwich - super tasty, Brisket - delish, collard greens - yum, and foie gras - mmmm.<br /><br /><br />While I really like to eat organic when I can (access and affordability being the factors), I have to say that I really preferred the taste of the food at John Brown&#039;s to Butcher Bar.&nbsp; I also liked the low key vibe of the joint, the sincere friendliness of the staff, and the complete lack of self-important-up-its-own-arse-ness.<br /><br /><br />To each his own but this will be my new go-to place for bbq.&nbsp;

				Are the in house fries good? I actually liked the old fries -- but I&#039;m a low brow kind of diner, and appreciate a frozen crinkle fry. <br /><br />I wish they would have a better salad selection, though. Yes, salad selection. My wife is a vegetarian and likes the salads and corn bread muffiny things at Butcher Bar, but I like John Brown&#039;s mac &amp; cheese, meat and the option of fries better. As a compromise, grateful that she&#039;ll let me eat BBQ, we go with Butcher Bar. If there was only something to lure her over to John Brown&#039;s, I&#039;d be one happy camper.

				Perhaps we should organize an Astorians dinner at John Brown&#039;s.&nbsp; Would anyone be interested?&nbsp; The place is small but takes reservations for larger parties.&nbsp; I suppose with enough advance notice we could even reserve a few tables.

Ribs were good, though they could have used a bit more flavor. Pulled pork -- fantastic, as usual. Turkey -- better than the turkey at Butcher Bar, nice smoky flavor but retained the moistness well.<br />&nbsp;<br />The new fries are okay, albeit greasy, and the packaging of said fries could be better for a to-go order. Still preferred the old crinkle fries. The mac &amp; cheese wasn&#039;t as good as it has been in the past -- not especially cheesy. Still good, but a bit off.<br />&nbsp;<br />The cat definitely approved, as he busted into the trash last night while we slept to get the rest of the leftovers. The dog wasn&#039;t smart enough to follow along, and missed out on all the fun.
