			<strong>JessC</strong>:

			I&#039;m moving out of state and want to sell the rest of my CSA share to one lucky Astorian. The CSA share originally cost $380 for weekly veggies from June through November. I&#039;m offering the same share (minus one month) for only $200! For approximately $10/week you can have enough fresh, organically-grown produce for 2-3 people. It all comes from Norwich Meadows Farm in Chenango County, NY. <br /><br />I just picked up the first haul of the season today:kale, Swiss chard, Napa cabbage, mixed lettuces, kohlrabi, radishes, baby beets, and spring garlic. It all looks awesome!&nbsp; <br /><br />For more information about Harvest Astoria, check out their website: http://www.harvestastoria.com/pricing/
