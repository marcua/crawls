				I get emails from Rooftop Films in brooklyn, and thought some may be interested in this...<br /><br />---------------<br /><br />Rooftop Films is offering two more Introduction to Avid Xpress DV classes, one in January and one in February. <br />&nbsp;<br />There have been a couple changes to the policies, so please read this email carefully before you register. The main differences are that the cost of the class will increase in February, and that payment must be received at least a week in advance. <br />&nbsp;<br />More details about Avid and the class are available at &lt;http://rooftopfilms.com/classes.html&gt;.<br />&nbsp;<br />Rooftop Films’ Introduction to Avid Xpress DV &nbsp;is a six-hour class, held over two weeknights, for $175 for a limited time, and for (a still cheap) $200 from February on. For an additional $25, you can also schedule two hours of lab time on another date: time for you to come in and play with the Avid on your own. <br />&nbsp;<br />The next classes will be: <br />&nbsp;<br />Tuesday, January 11th, from 6:30-9:30pm, and<br />Wednesday, January 12th, 6:30-9:30pm. &nbsp;<br />Cost: $175<br />Payment must be received by: Tuesday, January 4th<br />&nbsp;<br />Also:<br />Tuesday, February 8th, from 6:30-9:30pm, and<br />Wednesday, February 9th, 6:30-9:30pm.<br />Cost: $200<br />Payment must be received by: Tuesday, February 1st<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />REGISTRATION<br />To sign up, simply reply to this email, and include your name, address, phone number and the class you would like to take (January or February). Since the classes may fill up quickly, your place in the class is only guaranteed IF YOU HEAR BACK FROM US. That is very important: if you don’t hear back from us, that means you did not register in time. You will be placed on the waiting list for that class, and if there are any cancellations you will be notified. <br />&nbsp;<br />PAYMENT<br />Payment must be completed at least a week before the class, or you will lose your space. If you register, you will be sent an electronic invoice. The preferred method of payment is via credit card online through PayPal. If you are not a PayPal member, it's easy and free to sign up. <br /><br />You can also mail a check made out to Rooftop Films to: <br />Rooftop Films / 232 3rd Street / Studio E103 / Brooklyn, NY 11215. <br />&nbsp;<br />If we do not receive your check one week in advance of the class, you will lose your place. <br />&nbsp;<br />If you wish to pay cash, please contact Mark Rosenberg at &lt;avid@rooftopfilms.com&gt; to set up a time to come by the office. Do not stop by unannounced, as the office isn't always open.<br />&nbsp;<br />CANCELLATION<br />If you choose to cancel your registration less than a week before the class you will be refunded %50 of your money. Sorry, but we lose too much money on cancellations to refund more than that. <br />&nbsp;<br />CLASS SIZE<br />Classes will be limited to 5 people, so you’re sure to get plenty of time to work with the Avid. One space in each class will be reserved for people who have shown a movie at Rooftop Films or actively volunteered with Rooftop Films in the past. You know who you are – basically, if your movie screened or if you've come to a show and set up chairs, you're eligible. If not, don't ask. <br />&nbsp;<br />LOCATION<br />Classes will be held in the Rooftop Films office, located at 232 3rd Street, Room E103, in Brooklyn. For directions, please visit &lt;http://rooftopfilms.com/directions.html&gt;. Detailed directions will be emailed to you when you sign up. <br />&nbsp;<br />INSTRUCTOR<br />The instructor is Mark Elijah Rosenberg, the artistic director of Rooftop Films and a professional editor since 1996. Mark has been teaching Avid classes at other institutions since 2001. &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />Sign up now and get ready to make your movie. <br /><br />MORE CLASSES<br />If you would like to take a class, but cannot attend these sessions, please email us and let us know that you are interested. If there's enough interest, we might add more classes, and we’ll notify you about the next available session. <br />&nbsp;<br />Information about Rooftop Films Basic Video Production and Sound for Video classes will be coming soon.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />* * * <br />SUBMISSIONS<br />&nbsp;<br />Rooftop Films is seeking submissions for our 9th Annual Summer Series, to be held from June to September 2005. We show comedies, dramas, experimental shorts, animation, music videos, short and feature documentaries, political exposes, home movies, found footage and more. We want motion pictures that tell us about where you live and how you live, and we offer our filmmakers an audience in some of the most unique and inspiring open-air theaters to be found anywhere. We seek independent movies with original ideas, regardless of production values, and we screen the work of experienced professionals, long-time amateurs and first-time filmmakers alike. We strongly encourage submissions by women and people of color. We show films of all genres, formats, and lengths, as long as they're daring, creative and unique: so submit your work now. <br />&nbsp;<br />Full details, including a submission form, can be found at &lt;http://rooftopfilms.com/submit.html&gt;.<br />&nbsp;<br />_______________<br />Thanks for your time and interest in Rooftop Films. If you would like to be removed from this mailing list, please reply with “remove” in the heading. Or (better idea) if you would like to add friends to the list, please forward them this message with both their name AND &lt;subscribe@rooftopfilms.com&gt; in the “To:” heading.<br /><br />-- <br />Mark Elijah Rosenberg<br />Artistic Director, ROOFTOP FILMS<br />232 3rd Street / Room E103<br />Brooklyn, NY 11215<br /><br />Movies on a roof in Brooklyn.
