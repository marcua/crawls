				I think I posted about the temp (4 days) job I have now downtown? Tomorrow is my last day so I wanted to be sure and talk to the guy today (company VP) who hired me. I thanked him for giving me a chance and told him how many resumes I had sent out over the past month (200). My husband had told me before that I had to quit thinking &quot;Amarillo&quot; and realize a lot more people were applying for each job. Guess how many emails my boss told me he received in response to this job that was only four days long? Okay I&#39;ll just tell you - I&#39;m still blown away by it - 483 resumes for a four-day job!!!!!!!!!!!! Is that crazy or what?<br /><br />When I asked him if I could put him down as a reference on my resume he said &quot;sure, but I&#39;d really like to offer you a job here&quot;! I&#39;m so happy!! (Cathy does a little dance...not the salsa or flamenco, more like a macarena.) It isn&#39;t an exciting job, but almost everyone there is super-nice, (which means a lot to me), they have excellent perks and going by what I&#39;m being paid as a temp, they must have pretty good starting wages. Also this is a company that isn&#39;t going anywhere - they are making money hand-over-fist. <br /><br />At first I was like, eh, I don&#39;t know, what if one of these other more exciting &quot;only in New York&quot; places that I applied for calls me? Then I just kept thinking about how upset I&#39;ve been that I haven&#39;t gotten any callbacks on my resume, how broke I am, and about how in three months I will be kicking myself in the ass - HARD with my Ropers on - if I still don&#39;t have a full-time/stable job. And that number 483 just kept flashing in front of me. I mean, if this many people applied for a 4-day job how many are applying for the permanent jobs???<br /><br />I&#39;m going to get more details tomorrow (pay, vacation, etc) but I think I&#39;m going to take it!! I&#39;m still waiting to hear about a temp data entry job that is about two weeks long and at a really cool museum, but I&#39;m sure this place would be okay with me starting end of Sept/beginning of Oct. The commute is so easy, the hours are great, no weekends, not the kind of job you &quot;bring home&quot; and it would still allow me time to pursue classes/freelance work, can even wear jeans if ya want, which most people take advantage of! They order lunch in each Friday - $2000 worth (I signed the receipts), if that says anything about the kind of money they are making (it does to me) for about 60-90 employees. Falafels, pizza, salads, sushi and more. Never saw a business with such fancy beverage machines that are just for the employees, (there aren&#39;t a lot of customers who come to the office). Coffee, espresso, cappuccino....guess you can tell what I&#39;m impressed by.... :-) Actually it tells me they appreciate their employees!<br /><br />Anyway I&#39;m so so SO happy! And it has felt so good getting up early the past few days and heading off to work - like I said, being a contributing member of society again!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;:-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-)<br /><br />

				I am so happy for you! &nbsp;I know how dispiriting it can be to be out of work, even for a little while. &nbsp;The perks sound great I am jealous of your drink machine and jeans!! &nbsp;Congrats! &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;:-) &nbsp;:-) Two smileys up!<br /><br />In my former life we called those boots &quot;roach killers.&quot;

				Congratulations!! Sounds like some nice job perks. I can&#39;t believe how many applications employers get for temp jobs. Finding work is not easy... we should have a job-search support group (&#39;tho i am only ever half-heartedly looking myself....)<br /><br />Is this the same job you posted about last week?

				That&#39;s great news!!&nbsp; 8-) Congrats!<br /><br />Our supervisor said that he received <em>double</em> the amount of resumes for our seasonal position this year than he did last year.&nbsp; :-o It&#39;s a low-paying seasonal job fer cryin&#39; out loud!<br /><br />We were encouraged to apply w/in the company, only to find out that most of the positions are available to &quot;year-round employees only.&quot;&nbsp; :?<br /><br />They extended our stay an extra month to help us out, which is very nice, but the job market seems worse than ever.

				It&#39;s hard to make job-hunting your priority when you have a full-time job and others things going on! But try we must.... it really is all about being smart about networking and putting yourself out there, which is always a bit of a challenge for me.

				Congrats!<br />this job market sucks. its the only reason i haven&#39;t quit my job. i&#39;ve not only been applying to others but applying to grad school. the program i really want that has turned me down twice, told me last year there were 120 applicants for 20 spots and this year was over 200 of the same amount of spots. <br />its ridiculous. <br />i kind of had a breakdown over the whole thing last night actually. miserable at my job but i can&#39;t leave it until a) i have another one and b)that other ones pays at least the same. but i don&#39;t want to leave one admin job i hate for another one i will grow to hate, only it will take me less than 4 years to hate it. *sigh* until something better comes along, i console myself with ties socks and office supplies.<br />sorry didn&#39;t mean to highjack this very happy good news thread with a depressing diatribe.<br />cathy, once again congrats! you deserve it!
