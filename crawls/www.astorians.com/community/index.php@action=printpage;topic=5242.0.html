				Greetings,<br /><br />Tonight you&#39;ll see something new on your screen while browsing the site - an Astorians.com sponsor. In short, two Astorians have agreed to be part of a pilot program to sponsor two of the categories within the site in the form of a small banner advertising their service or product. The first Astorian to participate in the pilot is our own JustDesserts, who will be sponsoring the &quot;Restaurants &amp; Food&quot; category with her pastry products. The second Astorian to participate in the pilot will be announced shortly, but is a well-known local musician on the board.<br /><br />The hope is that Astorians.com will be able to provide a valuable service to local artisans, musicians, artists, and entrepreneurs that make this community strong - while also providing an additional way for individuals to support this site. The intention is to keep the advertiser-sponsors local, and evaluate them on a case-by-case basis. Your ideas and feedback are welcome.

				Would you please tell us the cost for such advertising so that we may tell our local merchants and cottage-industry friends and how they may contact you other than registering on the board and using a PM. Thanks.

				I haven&#39;t really settled on a suggested price yet. I hope that we&#39;ll be able to gauage how valuable the idea is both to Astorians, and to the sponsor. After a week or two hopefully we&#39;ll have a better handle on that and can think about how the process more formally might work. :)<br /><br />Can I assume you like the look of it NYCMacUser?

				I love it. I tried the link and checked out the shopping cart. Smooth as JD&#39;s ganache. She needs to add a few classic and seasonal pies and a couple of classic cakes, and she won&#39;t have time to worry about rent ever again!<br /><br />The link is innocuous and does not interfere with the way the board works.<br /><br />Bravo.<br /><br />Yes, I am very pleased, merm, very pleased. All the luck in the world JD.

				I would like to take this opportunity to thank merm and wasabisam for putting this all together for me.&nbsp; I&#39;m really touched and proud that they believe in me and product enough to advertise on this unique, special site.&nbsp; It&#39;s an honor to be the first.<br /><br />Massive thanks to flooz for hooking me up with my fly business cards and labels - without them I&#39;d just have scones in a plastic bag.&nbsp; Your labels make them professional.&nbsp; More massive thanks to lanseaux for her gorgeous photography of my pastries.&nbsp; I certainly couldn&#39;t have gotten those shots without you.<br /><br />And thank you to NYCMacUser for your words of encouragement.&nbsp; As I grow with my business (and kitchen space), the menu will indeed expand.&nbsp; Expect to see a cake menu very soon.<br /><br />This is amazing for me; thank you so much!!<br />

				Very cool!! Good luck, JD :) <br /><br />ETA:<br /><br />I clicked JD&#39;s link on the restaurants page - it goes here - http://www.astorians.com/artisan/justdesserts - but what&#39;s displayed is the astorians.com home page. <br /><br />

				Hey, I am having problems viewing JD&#039;s ad.&nbsp; Will it appear all the time, or only on certain threads/posts?&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen it once or twice, but not so far today since I&#039;ve been on the board.

				Is the Mets Express sponsoring this site now?&nbsp; There&#039;s a ad in the business section, by Google.&nbsp; Did I just notice it and it&#039;s been there forever?

				I&#039;ve been testing some local banner ads delivered by google. It is supposed to only advertise local stuff - so hopefully that works.<br /><br />Any initial thoughts?
