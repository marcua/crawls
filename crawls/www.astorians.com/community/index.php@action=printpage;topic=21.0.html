				i dont know about indian around ditmars, but there is a smelly, dingy, little hole of a bangladeshi curry joint down on 21st and astoria blvd called roti boti that makes fresh naan all day and night, has veg curries and a roti oven... knows what i mean when i say i like spicy food... coriander, anise, cumin, cloves... a little bit of a walk, but by bike like five minutes. definately worth the trip. oh, and i forgot. CHEAP.

				On 30th Ave there are a couple of places - Gandhi is so-so.. I've had their lunch special and it's alright. &nbsp;Meghna is awesome though.. it's on 34th street (I think) and 30th ave.. it's actually around the corner from 30th ave. &nbsp;It's great Indian Food. &nbsp;Takes them a really long time to cook it though - but well worth the wait.<br /><br />And also - it's not Indian food, but there's a guy with a cart on Steinway and 34th ave that makes the best Chicken and rice plate ever!

				There's a thread on Chowhound you might want to check out. &nbsp;They mention Gandhi and Megna, but also some others:<br /><br />http://www.chowhound.com/boards/outer/messages/51652.html

				The indian places in Astoria proper aren't very good, though Roti Boti is decent, especially for the price. &nbsp;Jackson Heights is a short ride on the 7 away. Take it to 74th and go to the Jackson Diner for the best Indian this side of Bombay.

				I'm surprised there aren't more Indian (or Bangladeshi) restaurants in Astoria. &nbsp;There used to be more. &nbsp;But the one I like is Meghna. &nbsp;Thank you, Timarimba, for offering your well-deserved praise.

				I love Meghna, too -- I usually order from there every Sunday. &nbsp;They recently changed their menu, and the order of Chicken Tikka Masala I had last week wasn't quite up to their usually high standards -- I'm hoping ownership and kitchen staff didn't change as well!

				I think the ownership did change--I hope they didn't get rid of the old cook &nbsp;:(
