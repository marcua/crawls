				I&#039;m 25/f looking for some other runners in Astoria. I see you out at the park and by the water but it&#039;d be creepy to approach you and say that I&#039;m looking for a running partner (which I am). Nothing too serious but please be able to run at least 3 miles at a 9:30 minute pace or faster. I consider running a hobby and therefore looking for someone who enjoys it not just for staying in shape but also as a social activity.<br /><br />Thanks!

				Just got back from a nice night run in the park, but one lap around the park = almost 15min for me! I usually do 4 laps (not often enough.)<br /><br />If you see a brunette ponytailed runner going about half your speed, feel free to say hi!

				I am trying to get back into running shape and probably can&#039;t work at your pace just yet.&nbsp; I hang around the 10-11 min. mark.&nbsp; After a few years of being inactive and recently quitting smoking, I&#039;m having to make up for lost time, but for me, part of having a partner is to help push each other.&nbsp; If you&#039;re ok with having to be a bit motivational at first and running with a guy, then feel free to contact me.&nbsp; I&#039;m usually available any evening and/or weekend for runs.&nbsp; Right now I run about 3 miles at work on the trails we have + at home, I run to the park and do 4 laps around the track before running back home.<br /><br />Have fun, and hope you find a partner.<br /><br />Justin

				Hey I&#039;m looking for a running partner as well!&nbsp; I&#039;m around 10 min. pace, but am very self-competitive and so tend to run faster with other people, esp. those faster than me.&nbsp; What hours/days are you available to run?&nbsp; If we&#039;re looking for the same times, we could do a test run and see how it is&nbsp; :-)

				Hi I&#039;ll be moving to Astoria next month.&nbsp; Been training for a 1/2 marathon at a slow pace 13-15 min mile.&nbsp; Normal runs are about 3-4 miles with one long run per week.&nbsp; Looking forward to seeing other runners out. Is there an organized meed up?
