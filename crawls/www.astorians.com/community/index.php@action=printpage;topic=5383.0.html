				Yes and it&#039;s very hard.&nbsp; Unless you have friends that let you know when someone is going to move it&#039;s extremely difficult.<br /><br />When I was looking for a place I literally walked every single block writing down the numbers posted in front of the buildings to the Management Companys and asking people that I saw walk out of buildings if there was a &quot;super&quot;.&nbsp; In all cases the Management Company referred me to the realtor/broker they used (a few of them have in-house brokers) and the &quot;super&#039;s where no help at all.&nbsp; I was lucky, I found my apartment through craigslist. <br /><br />Lately though I have seen a lot more &quot;for rent&quot; signs posted, you may want to just take a day and walk around the neighborhood.&nbsp; It&#039;s hard work but it&#039;s worth it.

				also, 15% fees are only standard in Manhattan. Astorian brokers seems to require either one month or 12%.<br /><br />I guess it really depends on how much your time is worth to you.

				I&#039;ve gotten 2 apartments out of 5 in Queens without fees.&nbsp; But it&#039;s hard work.&nbsp; Back then, I used the newspapers, I knew which days had the listings and which to use.&nbsp; But now, all those listings are online everyday.&nbsp; So check nytimes.com, newsday, village voice every day, I want to say all the time, or set up some email alert system.&nbsp; Some sites have this where you select criteria, and they email you listings fitting them as soon as they come in.<br /><br />As soon as you see a listing you like, get on the phone and be prepared to see it asap.&nbsp; Have a credit report and references handy.&nbsp; Be prepared to take it if you like it.&nbsp; Ask questions.&nbsp; Make sure you get a lease with the monthly rent in writing.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s probably the hardest way to find an apartment, but if you have lots of time on your hands, go for it.&nbsp; Otherwise, most realtors around here do charge only one month&#039;s fee, and the ones that ask for more are screwing you.&nbsp; See someone else who will charge you a month.&nbsp; And either have your own current credit report, or don&#039;t let them charge you more than $30.&nbsp; Credit reports are never $100, I learned this the hard way.<br /><br />Good luck!

				Thanks everyone....the advice totally helps. I suspected that we would have to go to a broker, and I&#039;m considering it a necessary evil. :)

				(sigh) I&#039;m trying to avoid using a broker as well...i don&#039;t have a huge budget (it might even be too tiny...) but i&#039;m trying to leave my roommates.&nbsp; Just a bad situation where we&#039;ve been &quot;trying&quot; to look for a place for over a year...and i&#039;m grown tired of waiting for them to pitch in and help, so i&#039;m thinking might be time to break free...<br /><br />Like someone else mentioned, i work crazy hours that constantly change as well...days off are often spent catching up on sleep, doing laundry or who knows what else.<br /><br />I&#039;m probably going to need a broker eh? ....but even still, I don&#039;t have a ton to spend---is there hope for me?

				I guess you should ask yourself how much you like Astoria and NYC, in general, and what are you willing to spend?&nbsp; I got really depressed before I found my current apartment because I thought I would have to leave Astoria and NYC for that matter!&nbsp; I considered moving to Philly, Chicago, or *gasp* Minneapolis!&nbsp; However, after much thought and talks with friends, I decided to stay.&nbsp; Maybe I was just lucky, but I found the perfect realtor (George @ Century 21, close to Ditmars 718-204-0101 http://www.c21alexiourealty.com/rental.html ) and he found in two weeks, the a nice apartment for a decent price!&nbsp; If you really can&#039;t afford a realtor, and I know it&#039;s hard!&nbsp; You should plan to save up a bunch because they&#039;re going to ask for everything as soon as they find the place!&nbsp; I was in a race, literally, with another person to get the cash to the realtor.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you really can&#039;t afford a broker, you can try craigslist, keep your eye on the posts here, or walk around the desired neighborhood, looking for vacancies. <br /><br />Best of luck on your search!&nbsp;

				I think you can do a search on Craigslist if you want to rent directly from an owner.&nbsp; My husband and I are renting directly from the owner of our 2-unit building; we totally lucked out and found our place in the ads in the back of the Village Voice (print version, not online).&nbsp; No fee, and since our landlords live nearby, everything gets taken care of quickly.

				It is extremely difficult to find something without using a broker, as I have been finding out the hard way. I have been looking for an apartment for my mother for several months now just combing the blocks, writing down the management companies phone numbers, and ringing super&#039;s doorbells. It has gotten me nowhere. I fear that I will have to suck it up and use a broker.
