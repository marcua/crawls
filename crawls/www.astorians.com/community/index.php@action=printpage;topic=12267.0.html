				My wife went to Michael&#039;s on Sunday, almost going into Boston Market first but decided not to. When she came out of Michael she saw police, firemen, and paramedics in front of the store.&nbsp; Turns out a car went through the front of the building.&nbsp; She is so gratefull that she didn&#039;t go in.<br /><br />Anyone seen any articles about this accident.&nbsp; I googled it and found nothing.&nbsp; I am just curious how it happened.&nbsp; Anyone that knows that parking lot know you can&#039;t drive that fast there.&nbsp; I am thinking someone did this on purpose.

				i heard nothing<br /><br />although, stuff like this happends all the time, most likely the person driving put the car in drive rather than reverse....i doubt it was done on purpose

				Yes you were PJ.&nbsp; Talk about wanting to make a speedy get away.&nbsp; If I mistakenly have the car in drive when it should be in reverse, or vice versa, I hit the breaks a second after the car starts to move.&nbsp; I don&#039;t understand how one could drive through a freaking storefront.... :-o

				It doesn&#039;t make any sense...<br /><br />Why would you press so hard on the pedal whether you&#039;re in drive or reverse. He must&#039;ve pressed on it for a substantial amount of time. Not only that but isn&#039;t there a curb he had to jump when going forward? <br /><br />What an idiotic driver, seriously...<br /><br />Revoke his license.

				Yeah Scribbles, you might be right about there being a curb he had to jump.&nbsp; It&#039;s been a while since I have been at the shopping strip.

				It&#039;s so strange, I was just there the day before and hadn&#039;t been around that area for years and years, but was somehow drawn to go to Home Depot and felt like having some Boston Market since there&#039;s none by me.&nbsp; One day later and... <br /><br />Weird.
