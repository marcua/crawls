				hey -<br /><br />i&#39;m more of a lurker than an active poster, but wanted to get the word out about a great little cafe that just opened across the street from my apartment building called Il Bambino. It&#39;s in the space where Martha&#39;s and, more recently, Corona Bakery used to be. In my opinion, it&#39;s an improvement over both. I got a mozarella &amp; pesto panini to go tonight, and it was fantastic - best i&#39;ve had since moving here. The baked goods all looked amazing, and they have something called &quot;warm maple milk&quot; i&#39;ll be trying on my way to work tomorrow. It&#39;s a relatively small space, but the design aesthetic is great and the variety of food is terrific.<br /><br />I mostly despair over the culinary options in my neighborhood; when my fiancee and I go out to eat, it&#39;s almost always in manhattan or Brooklyn. I&#39;m hopeful that Il Bambino will fill the huge need for cafes/tapas restaurants that dont think booming techno is suitable dinner music.

				well, i think the despair comes from there being a fair amount of cafe-type places where the quality of the food takes a backseat to the flouting of the smoking ban and the loudness of the thump-a-thump dance music. (cafe bar is another exception here.)<br /><br />anyway, i went to il bambino yesterday and it was super. everyone was friendly, my sandwich (prosciutto/mozz panino) was perfectly prepared, and i actually finished the saturday crossword.

				Just want to pile on some more love for this place. We checked it out the other night and tried the prosciutto di parma and the chicken, fontina &amp; olive spread panini. Both were excellent. The service was wonderful, too. <br /><br />I&#39;m so glad it&#39;s only a 30 second walk from our apartment! Between this place, Brick and Loveday 31, 31st Ave is finally getting interesting. :mrgreen:

				I finally stopped by this place tonight to try it out (hey, I&#39;ve been out of town!). I chatted for a bit with the owner - he&#39;s really nice. I think I remember he said his name is Darren - I have horrible memory with names. <br /><br />Anyway, he was cool enough to go through the long list of panini on the menu with me and explain all the meats and cheeses. I tried the prosciutto with gorgonzola dolce and fig spread. Yum! Apparently he had been working as a chef in Manhattan for a long time before he decided to open a place in his own neighborhood. I told him about Astorians and we swapped notes on our favorite restaurants in the area.<br /><br />I want to go back soon and dine in. It&#39;s BYOB right now, so you can take a bottle and settle in with a pile of tapas. Nice!&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				I went for dinner yesterday.&nbsp; Met the owner, nice guy from the neighborhood.&nbsp; <br />They do not have a wine beer license yet so went two doors down to the liquor store and got a bottle of wine. Love BYOB.&nbsp; Snagged one the the NY times sitting on the counter and settled in for some good eats.<br />Told the chef that I had to kill some time so he sent out some samples.<br /><br />-Proscuitti, fig jam and dolce gorgonzola panini. Delicious and well done. Very good ingredients.<br />-White bean, Parmesan, proscuitti and rosemary soup was sooooooo good. Chunky too.<br />-Tasting app. of slow roast tomato with riccota and lemon, roast beet and dry sausage, truffled potato.&nbsp; All very good and very pretty little items.<br />-speck panini that I brought home for wife.<br /><br />Everything was great and the place is warm and music was not too loud or intrusive.&nbsp; Will definitely be going back.&nbsp; Sort of blew my diet but it was worth it.<br />

				I actually had food delivered from them last night. <br /><br />I had the Soppresata, Fontina and Olive Spread Panini which was fantastic. For dessert I had the Chocolate rice crispy treat which had chocolate-peanut butter spread on it. That was really really yummy. <br /><br />This place is a godsend. I really love their food. And yes my diet is blown as well..... :-P

				OK, I went to Il Bambino this evening with a foodie musician friend tonight, and I have to say, we both loved it.&nbsp; The food was truly fantastic with clean, vibrant flavors.&nbsp; We decided to have tapas as opposed to paninis.&nbsp; We had:<br /><br />Smoked tomato bisque to start.&nbsp; A substantial bowl with lots of smokey peppery goodness that did not overpower the tomato flavor.&nbsp; It came with a crostini that was covered in a sundried/ovendried tomato spread with finely grated parmesan on the top. <br /><br />Il Bambino Antipasti:&nbsp; giant beans in salsa verde, house marinated artichoke hearts, roasted piquillo (I think) peppers, roasted and marinated cipolline onions, and beets with goat cheese.&nbsp; I loved the onions especially and also liked the earthiness of the beets.&nbsp; It was beautifully plated, too.<br /><br />Salad of asparagus with parmesan and portabello vinaigrette: asparagus was grilled (love the grill marks), parmesan (really good stuff) was microplaned on top.&nbsp; The vinaigrette had good sized bits of mushroom in it and it was nicely balanced a tiny bit on the acid side, which is the way I like it.<br /><br />Salad of beans with chorizo and salsa verde:&nbsp; More giant beans!&nbsp; Yum.&nbsp; They were covered in the same stuff the beans in the antipasti were, kind of a chimichurri sauce, but much tastier.&nbsp; Loved the thin slices of chorizo, which were more like dry salame than the mexican chorizo I&#39;m used to.&nbsp; Great flavors.<br /><br />Oven roasted tomatoes, rosemary ricotta fresca and black olive oil:&nbsp; One of my favorite dishes of the night.&nbsp; The tomatoes were sort of sweet, and the ricotta was gentle and sweet as well.&nbsp; Loved the back olive oil, which brought it all together.<br /><br />I asked the chef what he had for dessert, and he said, &quot;There&#39;s only one thing - warm truffle cake.&nbsp; That&#39;s it!&quot;&nbsp; He admitted he was kidding, but he said the truffle cake was fantastic.&nbsp; And it was.&nbsp; It was amazing!!&nbsp; I&#39;ve never had anything like it.&nbsp; It was so smooth and velvety.&nbsp; One slice is enough for two, if not four, people.&nbsp; JD, you gotta try this!<br /><br />So, I though the food was just stellar, some of the best I&#39;ve had since moving to Astoria.&nbsp; It was reminiscent of the kind of food I might have eaten in the Bay Area.&nbsp; Just really simply prepared and simply presented food.&nbsp; The chef was a super nice guy and his waiter assistant was really nice as well.&nbsp; A friendly couple of guys.&nbsp; &nbsp;I absolutely loved my time there and will most certainly be back.&nbsp; This place deserves much success.&nbsp; I encourage each and every one of you to go and eat this wonderful food.

				For me, last night, the big discovery was speck.&nbsp; So good!&nbsp; I&#39;d not heard of it before.&nbsp; I loved its smoky goodness.<br /><br />My panini was pretty delicious as well.&nbsp; Love those oven roasted tomatoes!

				I ate their Italian sausage panini for lunch yesterday and that filled me up quite a bit for such a moderately sized sandwich.&nbsp; I was a little worried, though, because despite all the well-deserved plaudits, it was pretty empty.<br /><br />I forgot to ask the proprietor what&#039;s the deal with the empty picture frames on the shelf.&nbsp; Seems like there&#039;s got to be a story behind displaying empty picture frames.<br /><br />They need bigger coffee cups (their coffee is excellent), but they were playing the Beatles the whole time I was there, so they get three thumbs up.

				Having been there 3x now, I constantly crave Il Bambino paninis. Unfortunately, their cappucinos are not that great, both Adam and I had one after a dinner and the coffee tasted burned with too much milk. It&#039;s too bad, but I still love that we can bring our own wine there and it&#039;s not like there aren&#039;t enough other coffee places in Astoria-duh!!! If I had money to burn, I&#039;d eat there once a week, just the egg salad panini alone makes me swoon....&nbsp; &nbsp;catch falling body.

Hey edava -&nbsp; you&#039;re referring to the truffled egg <i>crostini</i> right? If they put that egg stuff on a panini, that might be too good to be true. A bit messy.. but delish.&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				I love the truffled egg crostini as well as the crostini with Speck and Grana. Such a great combination. Im so glad they put a Panini shop in the area (Now all we need is a good pizza shop and were set!) . Hopefully they expand their menu to some more paninis and maybe some salads. I was thinking of giving them some suggestions next time I go there. They are probably starting out small for now just to test the interest, but im looking forward to what they do in the future. <br /><br />Speaking of Il Bambino, on Friday I attempted to recreate the Panini with Prosciutto and Gorgonzola, which is my favorite.&nbsp; I went to the Salumeria on 30th ave and got the goods, Actually I asked the guy at the Salumeria and he said that Gorgonzola Dolce and regular Gorgonzola are the same. I took his word for it. . It came out really good, even though I was missing Fig Spread. Does anyone know who sells that? <br /><br />I checked Key Food and I was surprised they didnt, seeing that they have just about every other obscure item. <br /><br />Do you know where they sell that? <br />

				I went over to bambinos when it first opened up with my b/f and we spoke to the chef and he&#039;s from high end french places in the city. We were pretty excited so we ended up trying it even though it was 10:00pm and they closed at 11. TRUFFLED EGG CROSTINI is my favorite. Very good selection of paninis. I have something called maple milk.....SOOOOO GOOD!!! Im going to try and mimic it see who I do. Fig spread, gorgonzola cheese thingy was good to. Over all I do recommend it....

				So glad to have found this post! We had walked past this place at one point and wondered over it, but reviews here and on Joey in Astoria sealed the deal. We tried it tonight and got the prosciutto de parma, fresh mozarella, and sundried tomato pesto tapas, the speck and grana crostini, the manchego and membrillo crostini, and the prosciutto with gorgonzola dolce and fig spread panini. It was all absolutely amazing, only cost about $25, and we couldn&#039;t even eat it all! Oh, and we got it delivery, which was refreshingly quick. Oh, and they accept credit cards for delivery orders, which seems to be somewhat of a rarity around here. Anyone know why that is?

				I&#039;ve been frequenting Il Bambino, my favorite restaurant in all of Astoria, for months now. Therefore I was shocked to find, upon my arrival last night, that the menu had been slightly modified. My shock quickly turned to glee however as I perused the menu and spotted all sorts of new, intriguing dishes. I went the vegetarian route and started with the roasted garlic butter and parmesan crostini, which was delicious and easily rivaled my old favorite, the oven roasted crostini. I followed that with an extremely flavorful salad of penne pasta, cherry tomatoes, olives, pesto, and Cacio di Roma cheese and I was floored.

				Another rave for Il Bambino.&nbsp; My friend knows someone who works there and took me there a couple of months ago.&nbsp; Couldn&#039;t believe I hadn&#039;t found out before!&nbsp; I had a soppressata panini that was out of sight.&nbsp; Really made me take notice because I&#039;m used to paninis being a bit boring, quite frankly.&nbsp; They&#039;re ubiquitous and not all that interesting in the Midtown delis near my office.&nbsp; Not boring at Il Bambino!&nbsp; The cupcakes are delightfully sinful.&nbsp; Love the iced coffee too and I agree the staff are really on top of their game.&nbsp; Good with the pointers and very welcoming.&nbsp; I hope this place thrives.&nbsp; Looks like it&#039;s on the way from all the positive reviews here.

				Went there last night and had the roasted garlic butter &amp; parmesan crositini (fabulous) and the penne salad.&nbsp; I was disappointed they removed the asparagus &amp; portabello salad.&nbsp; However, not many things were removed on the menu and most of the additions were under the Crostini section.

				Had another great meal at Il Bambino.&nbsp; Wonderful food, lovely service... everything was awesome.&nbsp; Had the panini with hot peppers, sopressata, asiago, and basil pesto, YUM!&nbsp; Love that crostini with the rosemary ricotta and tomatoes, and the tomato with the tuna is also delish.&nbsp; The antipasti platter had a terrific selection of roasted red peppers with tomato pesto, beets with goat cheese (my favorite), beans with pesto, artichokes with olive spread, and portobello mushrooms with asiago chese.&nbsp; I have a cupcake waiting for me, very exciting.<br /><br />This place is one of the best restaurants in the area.&nbsp; I hope astorians keep supporting it, too!&nbsp; :)

				Tonight I had some of the new Crostinis delivered.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Roasted Garlic Butter with Parmesean is to die for!!!! That was the best thing I have tasted as of recent.&nbsp; :mrgreen: :mrgreen:&nbsp; Also the Prosciutto/Pesto/Parmesean crostini is wonderful. I wish they could make that as a regular panini.&nbsp; There are a few more the guy rattled off to me on the phone, but those two stood out.&nbsp; I also had the mozzerella with black olive spread crostini which was good, but the other two totally overpowered it. <br /><br />&nbsp;I have a feeling all the new items will be on the website soon, since the website is under construction.&nbsp; I will totally continue to support Il Bambino and I look forward to all the amazing things they bring to us in the future.

				OK, I had the peanut butter-chocolate cupcake and I now think it&#039;s the best cupcake I&#039;ve had in Astoria.&nbsp; The cake is nice and light, not overly sweet, chocolatey, and of a pleasant texture, plus the loads of peanut icing on top studded with a few halves of mini peanut butter cups is delicious.&nbsp; It&#039;s velvety and peanut-buttery, with no graininess at all.&nbsp; It&#039;s a silky peanut buttecream, basically.&nbsp; This cupcake and the oreo cheesecake cupcake are both made in house, whereas the others are contracted out.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had them elsewhere and they are pretty tasty.&nbsp; But this peanut butter one is pretty fantastic.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also eaten the brownie, which is fabulous.&nbsp;

				I see no one has raved about the soups Darren is serving now. Guess I&#039;ll step up to the plate! <br /><br />They are amazing. <br /><br />Yes, it&#039;s just that simple. I don&#039;t know what magic is in that man&#039;s fingers, but he turns what should be the simplest meal into an incredible culinary experience. All of his tomato soups are wonderful - word is that Saturdays are going to feature them now because they are so popular. Then again, he mentioned the other day that he has sold out of soups every single day save two since they started serving them this winter, so that should say something about how great they are.<br /><br />Oh! Best part - soup and crostini designed to match the soup is $4.50. Definitely enough for a meal, or you can split another crostini or a panini with a second person, and be very satisfied. The first time I got the soup I was with two other people and we made the mistake of each ordering soup (which we didn&#039;t realize came with a crostini at the time), a crostini to share for the table, and a panini each. None of us could finish the paninis we were so full on everything else. <br /><br />Oh how I wish Darren did catering or rented out his restaurant for parties. It would be amazing. I&#039;m just praying for a lobster bisque to show up on the menu one of these days.

				So I finally got around to trying out this place.&nbsp; I got the aspargus and mushroom panini, and my parents tried the italian sausage and cheese, and the chicken cutlet with spicy mayo.&nbsp; The spicy mayo was too much for my mom, probably should just be a side order, it did look like a lot of mayo on that thing.&nbsp; But the other paninis were awesome!&nbsp; I have to say I was rather disappointed in the decor and atmosphere there, it&#039;s really cold, little heat, and the music was blasting.&nbsp; It was hard to hear each other.&nbsp; And the decor on the walls, the color paint, the set up of the back eating area, it&#039;s just kind of boring and drab.&nbsp; It could use some color, instead of dullish gray and yellow.&nbsp; The setup looked cheap, like the walls could fall apart if you kicked them kind of cheap.<br /><br />At $3.50 each, the brownies aren&#039;t cheap, but they are pretty darn good, and those cupcakes look to die for.&nbsp;

				I tried it in the hopes of it being as tasty as the Peanut Butter Hot Choc. Unfortunately, it was meh. It really just tasted like hot chocolate, no real hazelnut taste. <br /><br />I think the problem is that they use a &quot;base&quot; hot choc and then just steam it with nutella, which means its like a 2:1 ratio of chocolate to hazelnut. I&#039;m wondering if adding a little hazelnut syrup or extract would balance it out better. Or perhaps I got a dud one. Caveat emptor, I suppose.

				Thanks to you guys, I tried Bambino and had it twice last week.&nbsp; First night I had the chicken cutlet with olive spread panini and a red lentil soup.&nbsp; The panini was good but I fell in love with soup at first taste.&nbsp; &nbsp;A few nights later I had the proscuttio with&nbsp; hot peppers panini and cream of cauliflower soup.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure what I was thinking with the hot peppers because they really were hot (I have a low tolerance for very spicy), but once I removed most of them, there was still enough hot pepper seasoning left that it made for a perfect sandwich.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m not usually a cream of whatever/blank fan, but this soup was pretty darn good. And hey, I still have the leftover in my fridge.&nbsp; <br /><br />Haven&#039;t gotten around to the cupcakes or brownies yet, oh but I will, I surely will!

				I had a post about the Nutella hot chocolate that must have been lost in the server outage - I tried it a couple of weeks ago and really liked it.&nbsp; It&#039;s not in your face, but I found it did have a really nice level of subtle Nutella flavour that was just right for me.&nbsp; Then again, I don&#039;t like things like flavoured coffee or so-called &quot;coffee drinks&quot; like &quot;pumpkin spice latte&quot; or what have you, so I appreciated the understatement.&nbsp; It was definitely noticeable, though.<br /><br />They&#039;ve also just renovated -- painted the seating area a really nice two-toned brown/grey scheme and added funky mirrors and other wall hangings.&nbsp; It looks great.

				Well, now I&#039;m getting positive nods.&nbsp; You are a fickle bunch!<br /><br />Okay, I&#039;ll call Il Bambino tonight and start the thread.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t want to know about the soups, don&#039;t click on it.

				I guess some folks just like to be surprised when it comes to their soup.&nbsp; It&#039;s like waiting until birth until discovering the gender of your baby...or something...

				Echoing all of the praise of Il Bambino. It is an Astoria treasure. I almost hate to add to the online praise for fear of having to wait for a table. <br /><br />Aside from the spectacularly fresh food - you can&#039;t beet the BYO policy. <br /><br />It&#039;s also a great place for a date. <br /><br />Lastly, try the cupcakes. Their essentially Crumb&#039;s, but much cheaper.

				Just wanted to let everyone know that Il Bambino now has opened their outoor patio/garden in the back.&nbsp; I was there this afternoon and thought it was lovely.&nbsp; They do plan to install awnings for shade, because it can get warm back there mid-day.&nbsp; Anyway, it&#039;s great!&nbsp;&nbsp; Worth a visit for sure. <br /><br />They added a bunch of new things to the menu, too.&nbsp; I would recommend especially the spicy avocado and goat cheese crostini, as well as the &quot;salsa formaggi&quot; crostini.&nbsp; The carrot and feta salad is also delicious.&nbsp; I&#039;m a big fan of the &quot;Rain&quot; white wine - it&#039;s delightful.<br /><br />This is a great addition to Astoria&#039;s summer outdoor restaurant spaces!
