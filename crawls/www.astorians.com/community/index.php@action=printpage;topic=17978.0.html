				Let&#039;s add the corner of Broadway and 32nd St to this problem area.&nbsp; Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights between 1 AM and 4:15 AM tend to be a street brawl at least once or twice a weekend.&nbsp; The police are on this block a couple times a week handing out tickets between 4 and 7 pm to drivers turning left onto Broadway off of 31st.&nbsp; Why can&#039;t they have a cop car there at the chicken stand just to keep the peace?&nbsp; Plus that chicken stand doesn&#039;t help matters (although it is damn good....)

				These things always go on, why be surprised now?&nbsp; &nbsp;There was also a fight of some kind on Broadway&nbsp; between 29th and Cresent last night, ambulance came.&nbsp; &nbsp; If they put&nbsp; a cop car on 33rd avenue and 28th they could make an arrest a weekend between 3 am + 4:30 am.<br /><br />It&#039;s a shame, but so many people, and so many clubs and bars, it unfortunatley is going to happen.

				Let&#039;s wait til one or two isolated incidents happen somewhere, and have a freak-out knee jerk reaction to it afterward as if it&#039;s an epidemic sweeping the borough. We can arrange protests and petitions to our councilman. I am going to march on Washington and make the world aware of the violence that is overtaking Astoria!!!

				Sounds like it&#039;s definitely more that one or two isolated incidents. What&#039;s wrong with being concerned for the safety of one&#039;s own neighborhood?

				Like I said, every weekend on 32nd and Broadway.&nbsp; &nbsp;Not just a knee jerk reaction.&nbsp; Besides the safety factor of coming home late at night why should my child be woken up constantly by fights in front of my building.&nbsp; I can deal but try to tell a 4 year old what is going on when he can hear and see the brawls outside his window.

				I apologize- I was just poking a little fun to what I perceive as over-reacting. <br /><br />These sorts of things happen. Of course nobody wants to live in a neighborhood where people get stabbed or in fights all the time. Unless it is really becoming an escalating problem, I wouldn&#039;t really feel the need to call my local politicians and demand some sort of rectification for this problem. I have personally come to expect the fact that in any neighborhood, no matter how nice, fights will break out once in a while, particularly when there are bars or clubs involved. <br /><br />That&#039;s pretty bad that someone got stabbed, but I personally would not get too up in arms about it. We live in a city, these sorts of things happen once in a while.

				I do have agree that there is a consistent problem with the 32nd/Broadway corner between 2am - 5am on Saturday and Sunday mornings. &nbsp;That wanna-be club on the North side of the street closes down and out spills a bunch of drunken MTV&#039;s Jersey Shore-like folks. &nbsp;I&#039;m often woken up to what sounds like riots in the street. &nbsp;That will go one for a 1/2 before I hear police sirens. &nbsp;I just wonder why they don&#039;t post more cops around that area since it is a known trouble area.

				Not the first time there&#039;s been a stabbing in that area:<br /><br />http://gothamist.com/2008/09/29/queens_club_no_stranger_to_violence.php<br /><br /><br />There was also a shooting on Steinway and 19th avenue Friday night at a :shock: night club.<br />

				Mer, get ready for more action on the corner of Broadway and 32nd.&nbsp; Looks like another club is going into the basement space next to the fitness club.&nbsp; There was a club there that closed down about 4 years ago, below the closed banquet hall.&nbsp; The brawls were out of control there at 4 a.m..&nbsp; I have heard another bank will go in on the main floor and the club in the basement.
