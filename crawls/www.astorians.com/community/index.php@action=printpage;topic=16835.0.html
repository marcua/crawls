				I think they&#039;re on the corner of 23rd or 24th St., right across from the Triboro ramp.<br /><br />Like everybody else, we&#039;re hoping to buy soon and take advantage of the lower prices, but remain leery of the cheap construction and prices that remain inflated in the &#039;hood.<br /><br />Might just stop in and check it out, if they don&#039;t require a credit check, appointment, etc. etc.<br /><br />What sucks is that all the developers seem to be holding out for the people who want to live in Manhattan, but are still priced out.<br /><br />

				I mean, those who feel Manhattan is too much money are likely to look at the closest outer boroughs. I suspect developers are hoping that those people will snatch up overpriced apartments with few amenities, figuring that the prices are slightly lower than Manhattan.<br /><br />For those of us who never could (or would) consider Manhattan, there aren&#039;t any realistic options. It&#039;s either faux-luxury or something dilapidated. Nothing in between it seems.

				Query: Prospective buyers perpetually feel that housing prices are inflated.&nbsp; Yet, even in this market, prices never have and never will fall to those desired.&nbsp; <br /><br />So, are prices truly inflated, or is it simply expensive to buy in this area.

				I think people don&#039;t seem to know better or are a poor judge of value and quality...and will <em>seemingly</em> pay whatever for anything.&nbsp; I guess I don&#039;t really get it - these apartments all have no closets, poor floor plans, etc.&nbsp; But these apartments are all getting to the point where people have to be spending a disproportionate amount of their income on housing...and for a rental it just seems silly.<br /><br />A luxury condo in Brooklyn (the one featured prominently on top chef, new york) went bankrupt this week...there are many units all over the city that have vacancies or didn&#039;t sell well and were forced to go rental.&nbsp; Even though prices have remained high, that doesn&#039;t mean the buildings are financially viable.&nbsp; <br />

				Feels like a monopoly- all the developers are going to hold out because people HAVE to live someplace!&nbsp; :-P<br /><br />Who on earth has that kind of money?? And if they do, why would they overpay for a place that won&#039;t yield much of a profit when it comes time to sell? Isn&#039;t that one of the main reasons to own?

				I love they call those buildings &quot;luxury&quot;. We all saw them build those things and know they&#039;re *cheap construction*. <br /><br />I wonder how long it&#039;ll be before they&#039;re renting them out at what the neighborhood folks can afford?<br /><br />I agree with you guys, who in their right mind would want to live next to the Triboro/RFK bridge and pay through the nose for a cinderblock building, even if it does have a waterfall in the lobby.

				Hi all...just saw this posting and wow there is some harshness out there.<br /><br />I went to Hoyt South a couple weeks ago and was sooo impressed that I rented there. I am in the Real Estate / Construction industry and this place is built SOLID jamiebwolcott if you ain&#039;t been there, do not knock it. You do not hear a thing in that place and you are right on the bridge, tells you something right there...I mean I could hear a pin drop in my apartment sooo way to gooo Anderson and insulation that the developers of Hoyt South used...<br /><br />Water Fall is awesome (not cheap so if you drive by again Christine, I urge you to stop in for a real glimpse of the place)<br /><br />I have been in Astoria for a long time and this family owned business is a pleasure to deal with and treat tenants like their own family. Meticulously kept in all aspects!<br /><br />BTW, I changed the title of the post because it was mis-leading, they are all ONLY apartments and not for sale.<br /><br />Sorry for the rant, but someone had to tell the truth from someone who actually visited and rented at Hoyt South...

				Was this originally constructed as condos and then switched to rentals due to the current market being so lousy?<br /><br />Central heating-a/c would require a bldg engineer to be on-site 24/7.

				Picasso, how would I be paying for the waterfall electric if I have my own central unit specifically for my apartment? There are no common charges in the building, just what you use in your own unit.<br /><br />Christine, I asked the same question when I first visited and the answer is no. They told me they have other properties and none are condos, only apartments. I thought the same when I saw it, they have to be condos...but they never were. Not sure what you mean about A/C comment, a bit confusing. Depends on individual comfort, does it not? They do have people on-site to help with anything you need.

				Keep in mind, J Dog, that whenever somebody comes on the board as a first-timer with glowing reviews about anything (recent examples include hairdressers, restaurants, and real estate brokers), we tend to get pretty suspicious! <br /><br />It&#039;s part of the new marketing trend, getting people to pose as customers and write glowing reviews online. As a community, of course we&#039;re going to question newcomers (who often only post about that one thing, and are never seen/heard from again.)<br /><br />There&#039;s a tremendous demand for decent, reasonably-priced apartments for sale. If they existed, they&#039;d sell immediately. Instead, we keep seeing the same crap over and over again, pseudo-luxury, when we&#039;d be happy with plain old quality and good amenities.

				Dropped in to check the building out for ourselves today. We walked in and called the number advertised, and the owner was by within a couple of minutes.<br /><br />He was gracious enough to give us the full tour at the last minute, knowing that we weren&#039;t likely to take something (just browsing.) Very nice guy, seemed to be on a friendly basis with the tenants we saw.<br /><br />19 total units, both 2brs are taken. We saw the 1brs and penthouse studio. There are four different layouts to choose from for the 1brs (661-701sq ft.) Central rec areas, gym and laundry room which seem to facilitate social interaction, including rooftop access (landscaping in near future.)<br /><br />Pros: Contemporary decor, hardwood floors, stainless steel kitchen appliances, hot water heat included. Cool views, I enjoy being able to see the Triboro and across to the train trestle, plus fun people-and-traffic watching opportunities. Ample windows and natural light throughout w/good noise insulation. Some great views of NYC skyline (Empire State Bldg.) High ceilings, stone countertops. Nice closets w/solid wood single-panel doors. Exterior doors, thermal pane w/weather-seal. Jaccuzi tubs. Nice hardware/fixtures. Kitchen appliances and countertops are beautiful. Small terraces, room for seating. Wired throughout for cable. Ample outlets and cabinet space in kitchen. Close to train. ADA compliant. Video security door buzzers (you can see who&#039;s buzzing.) Elevators. Parking available for extra cost.<br /><br />Cons: Traffic noise (on Triboro side; tradeoff for the views), some face directly across from other apt windows, new building construction nearby might block views eventually. Small size- you can see the entire place while standing in the doorway. No pets allowed (could also be a &quot;pro,&quot; depends!) Roof is not ADA accessible (not a con for everybody.) High price compared to local average.<br /><br />Our overall impression: This is a sleek, friendly place that would suit high-earning single people who are not home much. The space is a little too small for couples IMO (at least, until the 2brs open up again.) Kinda like a vertical gated community for young people! I still wouldn&#039;t call it &quot;luxury&quot; due to the size and location, but I&#039;m sure it&#039;s better than the Pistilli and other new bldgs in the area with tiny kitchens and less closet space. We were impressed with the attention to detail, which was refreshing. &quot;Upscale contemporary&quot; is more like it.

				I was lucky to be at the open house of Hoyt South a few months back.&nbsp; <br /><br />Having rented from the owner of this property (at a building at the other side of this block on Hoyt)...I may be bias, because frankly, i love the man.&nbsp; So sweet and accommodating.&nbsp; Thought these rentals were REALLY nice.&nbsp; Every unit has a terrace.&nbsp; The kitchens are incredible....several elevators, gym, etc.<br /><br />Yes, you have the bridge. but having lived RIGHT THERE for 3 years, i never had a huge problem with the noise (only the occasional police car pulling someone over)<br /><br />It&#039;s expensive, but if i had a family and a decent job, i&#039;d think about it.&nbsp; You&#039;re only 3 blocks from the train!

				I had a friend that lived on Hoyt, a block away from the bridge, but the whole apartment would shake and you&#039;d hear so much noise from the truck deliveries all night.&nbsp; It was a loud place and hard to sleep at with all the racket.&nbsp; &nbsp;I would never choose to live near the bridge or the subway, why subject yourself to all that noise and (direct) smog?&nbsp; The place sounds nice but the luxury can&#039;t make up for the horrible location.&nbsp; I guess some people get used to it, but I also guess I would rather not.
