				Hi, I&nbsp; was wondering if anyone in the &#039;hood would like to meet up a few times a month for a playdate either in a group or with my almost 4 year old daughter. She is friendly, fun, and an only child.&nbsp; I would love for her to have more contact with kids on the weekends....she does go to school full time and hangs out in the playground afterwards and has school &quot;friends&quot; but on the weekends we&#039;re usually on our own.&nbsp; I am concerned that she should spend more of her free time with other kids.&nbsp; if anyone&#039;s interested in meeting up in the eve for quick playground fun or on the weekend for an outing (I have a couple of family memberships to share) or a trip to the park, I&#039;d love to&nbsp; hear from you. Pls. pm me if this would be of interest.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				i&#039;m sorry i can&#039;t set something up with you-- i have a new baby as well as a 4 yr old, so i&#039;m booked and exhausted-- but i happen to know that next saturday there will be many 3-5 year olds at the Two Coves Community Garden harvest festival... and until it gets too cold to garden, my 4 yr old (and my baby and me) will be there saturday mornings. you&#039;re welcome to come dig in the communal dirt!

				All are welcome this Saturday (and technically every saturday. there&#039;s a reason it says &quot;community&quot; in the name, despite what some gardeners might think... cough cough...)<br /><br />Anyway, it&#039;s the little triangle of land where 30th Ave and Astoria Blvd intersect, round about 8th street. Head West on either road and eventually you&#039;ll get there. :)<br /><br />They ask that all children be supervised by an adult, and to respect others&#039; plots. (ie, don&#039;t let the kids run through the gardened areas or pick plants there). However there&#039;s a big green lawn and a big dirt pile that are very kid-friendly. This Saturday there will be some kids activities, as well. (i believe a costume parade might happen?) And yummy food to share.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />alia
