				Anyone know a good tax preparer in the nabe that knows how to get the maximum refund? I am just sick of using H&amp;R Block and the likes. And the Liberty Guys the velvet robes scare me. Lol.<br /><br />Any suggestions would be great!

				How complicated are your taxes? If you&#39;re salaried, rent a house, don&#39;t have significant investment income, and are taking the standard deduction, you can almost certainly do it yourself. If you make less than (I think) $55K, you can download free software from the IRS to fill out the forms for you so you don&#39;t have to worry about math errors. You should have a copy of last years&#39; tax forms that H&amp;R submitted for you. Assuming your situation hasn&#39;t changed much, you might walk through it to see if you can figure out what they did, and then try doing the same things this year. <br /><br />If you own a house and have lots of investment income, (a) lucky you, and (b) I guess you should hire a real accountant... :) Preferably not one wearing a costume!&nbsp; :crazy:<br /><br />(I&#39;m doing mine by hand this year, as usual, and hoping my Federal refund is bigger than my State/Local amount-owed!)<br />

				yeah actually the reason i am so eager for a rouge individual again is that I used someone else last year that got me 3 times (seriously) the return and pointed out that H&amp;R was missing a few huge deductions. either way I&#39;ve lost my contact with this guy and am now looking for someone that good again! I have the return so I can see what he did, half of me just wants to plop it down on H&amp;R block&#39;s desk and say.. do this for me! lol<br />

				A word to everyone on this board (and everyone they know) about Liberty Tax Service-do not use them!!!! I went to them when I first moved here to take care of some past tax issues, which I thankfully did take care of&nbsp; :-) Then about six months later I get a check in the mail for about $400 from the feds and a letter stating that a mistake had been made on the part of Liberty Tax Service and that as a result I was due this refund, well howdy dooty tooty fruity :lol: :lol:, how often does that happen. I put that baby in the bank, stopped in Liberty one day on my way home from work and let them know of the mistake and also informed them I would not be giving them my service as well as telling them instead of having some character in costume, they should spend more of a focus on how they fill out thier customers tax forms. I now go to Jackson Hewitt and have been very happy with them for three years :)

				Honestly, I would just use an online tax program.&nbsp; I&#39;ve used Tax Act online and I&#39;ve been pleased.&nbsp; You can do it for free, or fork out a little extra (I think like 10 bucks) and they&#39;ll remember your tax information from the previous year and add it to your current.&nbsp; I actually ended up getting an extra couple hundred back because it remembered that I&#39;d had an income loss with Student Loans and Investments that I was able to carry over.<br /><br />It&#39;s step by step and easy to use and, seriously, if you need help, I could probably walk you through it.&nbsp; Your taxes would probably take about 30 minutes if you don&#39;t have anything crazy.&nbsp; <br /><br />And I STRONGLY advise against H&amp;R.&nbsp; I paid them $210 and the guy missed out on about 500 bucks that I should have gotten back and actually found on my own the next year when I decided to do them myself.&nbsp; The guy didn&#39;t put ANY of my education expenses on the form.&nbsp; I guess I could have figured it out when I watched him try to dial out on the telephone USING HIS COMPUTER KEYPAD!<br /><br />Honestly, most of the tax preparers are seasonal and go through a, relatively, short training process.

				Use your computer!&nbsp; I&#39;ve been doing it online for about five years now and the software I use actually saves my information online (which might be a little scary, if you think about it) so it only takes about a half an hour to complete my taxes.&nbsp; Of course, I file the 1040 Very EZ and the NY State IT100 (I believe that&#39;s the simple form).&nbsp;

				I e-file mine using TAX SLAYER.com.&nbsp; It is free if you are 25 or under.&nbsp; Otherwise it is only 9.95.&nbsp; It is quick and easy.&nbsp; They ask you questions through an interactive wizard.&nbsp; I guess it is much easier if you just have some W2s, standard deductions, and a couple things here and there.&nbsp; This also includes the FEDERAL and STATE returns.&nbsp; There are questions about NYC tax, too so that will be included.&nbsp; I have them just put the refund right into my bank account.<br /><br />The Student Loan Interest stuff is definitely a good thing to remember.&nbsp; Max is $2,500 a year.&nbsp; Also teaching expense of $250 max a year!

				I use Crowley in Brooklyn. they are very good if you are an independent contractor, have multiple income sources, and deductions or work in a unionized job. I&#39;ve dealt with the same people there for years and they always know the latest tax laws and what you can and cannot deduct. They will also give you advice for the following year on how to reduce your tax burden which I always find helpful. I do everything via mail and telephone. I&#39;ve been going to them so many years I won&#39;t go anywhere else. Last year they charged $115 to do everything.

				I&#39;m home nursing a headache this morning, so I decided to do my taxes. (wtf!?!) Easy this year. Only three Federal adjustments -- interest income, student loan interest deduction, and the telephone tax credit. I&#39;m getting $42 back from the Feds. NY state was easy too this year, since all my income was from New York State, unlike last year when I lived/worked in CT part-time. Interest income, student loan interest deduction, standard sales tax adjustment and NYC school tax adjustment. I&#39;m getting $8 back from the State. That $50 isn&#39;t going to get me to Bermuda this year. Sigh... At least I don&#39;t owe anything...&nbsp; :|
