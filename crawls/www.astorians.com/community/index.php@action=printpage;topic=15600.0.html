				I&#039;ve suddenly decided that I&#039;d like to learn another language.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t yet on the language.&nbsp; It&#039;s a toss-up between French, Arabic, Russian, Japanese and German at the moment, but French is leading the pack.&nbsp; I&#039;m curious as to whereabouts I can go to take classes in the language.&nbsp; I&#039;m bilingual and have studied two other languages so I&#039;m familiar with grammatical tenses and the like and feel like I can teach myself a language after a certain point, but feel like I need a guide such as an introductory course to get the ball rolling, just to learn proper pronunciation and to get in-person answers to inevitable questions that arise.&nbsp; Anyone have any idea on where I can go to take evening or weekend classes in a language and as far as roughly how much they will cost.&nbsp; Of course, I&#039;m trying to keep the cost down, but don&#039;t want to totally scrimp on quality to save a few bucks.&nbsp; <br /><br />This doesn&#039;t necessarily have to be in Astoria.&nbsp; In fact, I&#039;m expecting it won&#039;t be.&nbsp; I work a 9-6 near 14th Street in Manhattan and am really open to anyplace subway-accessible in Manhattan or Queens.

				The New School offers language classes through their continuing education program.&nbsp; They generally have excellent classes and are on the pricey side.&nbsp;

				The French Institute has a wide range of classes. I took a couple awhile back and enjoyed them.<br /><br />They&#039;re located on 60th Street between Madison and Park - very close to the Fifth Avenue N/W/R stop.<br />They also have a lot of French cultural events - films, lectures, etc. <br /><br />Good luck!<br /><br />
