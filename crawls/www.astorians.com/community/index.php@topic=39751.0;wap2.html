			Hello!<br /><br /><br />I am a cat mommy of 3 and have done volunteer work with a rescue group, as well as fostered cats in my home. I am available to provide care for your kitty at your home, or can cat sit in mine. Open to taking care of other animals, however, can&#039;t have dogs in my apartment. <br /><br /><br />I am fine with administering medications, and have a large, clean home with windows that are perfect for cat naps, overlooking the gardens below. Please message me with any questions or inquiries.<br /><br /><br />Amy
