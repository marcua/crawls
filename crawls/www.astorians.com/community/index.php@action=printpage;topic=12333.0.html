				My gf and I went to El Jamon (2551 Steinway) today for a late lunch.&nbsp; The restaurant was fairly empty, with spanish music playing in the background.&nbsp; We set down and ordered from the prix fixe menu.&nbsp; I got the lentil soup for app, then pasta with littleneck clams for main course, and flan for dessert.&nbsp; My gf got the grilled pork for app, grouper in white sauce for main course, and chocolate mousse for dessert.&nbsp; After the order, we got an amuse bouche of chorizo and croquettes, which was nice.&nbsp; Bread and olive oil came shortly afterward (good oil, btw).&nbsp; After that, the lentil came.&nbsp; It was a nicely cooked in a delicious broth, with bits of chorizo in it.&nbsp; I really wanted to finish the big bowl of lentil, but decided to save my appetite for the main course and desert.&nbsp; <br /><br />My main course--pasta--came pretty quickly after the soup.&nbsp; There were about a half dozen clams in a white wine/(seafood?) broth with tomatoes, onions, and maybe a bit of saffron.&nbsp; The pasta was cooked al dente, as it should be.&nbsp; It was a simple pasta dish, but slightly too salty (not unforgivable).&nbsp; It was okay, but any decent Italian restaurant can do this much better.&nbsp; I ate most of the pasta, but did not finish as I was starting to get too full.&nbsp; After a short breather, we got our dessert.&nbsp; The flan that came was just standard restaurant flan, which is to say it wasn&#039;t mind blowing, nor was it bad.&nbsp; While we were eating our desserts, the waiter brought out some sweet croquettes and a sweet dessert wine.&nbsp; The gesture was appreciated, but we did not fully appreciate the whole thing since we were both bursting at the seams.<br /><br />Overall, it wasn&#039;t an exceptional experience, but a slightly above average lunch for a very average price ($12.50/person).&nbsp; After tax, tip, and drinks, we were still under $45.&nbsp; While this is restaurant week, we learned that their prices are the same as with their normal menu.&nbsp; The restaurant is about 6 months old, so it still has lots of room to improve--foodwise.&nbsp; The service was very good for us (perhaps because we were the only people there).&nbsp; We both left in a semi-food comatose state of being--our palates satisfied.&nbsp; We do want to come back and try their dinner menu at some other time.
