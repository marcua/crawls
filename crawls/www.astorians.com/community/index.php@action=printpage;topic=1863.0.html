				One of my favorite condiments is hot sauce.&nbsp; I&#39;m a big fan of both the Chipotle Tabasco (don&#39;t like regular Tabasco) and Cholula, I think perhaps because of their high vinegar content.&nbsp; Tapatio is good, too, if I want a strong pepper flavor.&nbsp; I&#39;d like to expand my hot sauce palate.&nbsp; What do you like?&nbsp; And where do you get it?

				Lately I&#39;ve been using more powdered habanero pepper than sauces, but I like a green habanero sauce called El Yucateco, and my brother sent me a Scotch bonnet sauce that has a nice, fruity flavor.&nbsp; I have to admit that I bought one hot sauce, &quot;Weapons Of Ass Destruction,&quot; just for the name--but it turned out to be worth it; it&#39;s great.

				Yup, the place I was thinking of is the one south of plaza lounge on the same side of 29th St. (east side of street), and not on the corner of 29th St. and 30th Ave..&nbsp; It&#39;s got a green awning with white lettering (I think) on it that says &quot;Original Mexican Food&quot;.&nbsp; Quite an extensive menu.

				You know, I&#39;ve seen it (Cholula) before in Key Food, but it&#39;s not a regular thing. They&#39;ve also stopped carrying Tapatio recently in favor of some inferior sauce.<br /><br />I think Trade Fair may carry them both though, up on 36th St and Ditmars.

				Well it could be that I&#39;ve seen the Cholula at Key Food before and it wasn&#39;t at Trade Fair. No matter what, both of those stores are horrible at keeping things on the shelf regularly. Just when I find something I like they are &quot;out of stock&quot; for 4 months, and then get a whole bunch. I&#39;ve started shopping at Key Food much like a Costco shopper. Buying several months worth of things just to be sure I can last through until the next restock.

				That&#39;s true. With the developers increasing density in the neighborhood there will be so much demand for the Tapatio that likely the infrastructure that supports the local flow will become maxxed out. I say we blame the politicians now for our future shortage of Tapatio.<br /><br /><br />It&#39;s located in the little vegetable stand under the subway station on 31st Street at Ditmars.

				While on vacation, I tasted the Tabasco Habañero sauce...WOW.&nbsp; Such great flavor and heat!&nbsp; Spicier than the Chipotle Tabasco, which is my favorite, and definitely spicier than the Jalepeño Tabasco.&nbsp; I would love to get my hands on some of that Habañero sauce, mmm...<br /><br />P.S. I had this sauce at Disneyland&#39;s California Adventure.&nbsp; Awesome on fries.

				Once, I saw the habanero Tabasco at the Key Food on 31st St.&nbsp; Once.&nbsp; It was only the little bottle, and for some reason, I only bought one.<br /><br />I&#39;ve ordered stuff off their website before.&nbsp; It&#39;s fast service.<br /><br />In fact, I need to get some more of the habanero Tabasco.&nbsp; It&#39;s really great stuff - such a great balance.<br /><br />(p.s.

				The Key Food on 31st near Ditmars carried the little bottles of the habanero once -- that&#039;s where I got it.&#160; Haven&#039;t seen it since, and I&#039;ve asked them a few times about it.<br /><br />I suppose you could try to buy a bottle off of Fatty&#039;s.&#160; That&#039;s the first place I ever tried it.<br /><br />I really like the chipotle, too.&#160; I like all of them.&#160; We currently have the regular, green, chipotle, garlic and habanero Tabasco (plus numerous other hot sauces).

				Give me Naga Jolokia :-D or give me death :evil:.<br /><br />They are hard to find though&nbsp; :-(. Nicobena has some Naga pickels for sale. Much hotter and flavorful than Habaneros. Though Habaneros and it&#039;s Jamaican cousins are great too. :lol:
