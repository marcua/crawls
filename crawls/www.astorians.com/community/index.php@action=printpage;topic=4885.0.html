				So I&#39;ve always been a supporter of local music, and local spots to hang out grab a brew and listen to some tunes. The only places I know of though are down in the village, are there any cool spots around Astoria I should know about? I&#39;m not looking for anything too loud, i&#39;d prefer something with more of a mellow atmosphere, but I&#39;d be willing to try any place out at least once.<br /><br />the floor is open, don&#39;t be shy!

				Cassidy&#39;s used to have cover bands, but they&#39;re closed and I&#39;m not sure what is going in that space.&nbsp; Waltz has music on occasion, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s usually bands.&nbsp; I wish we had some small indie venues that would bring bands to the neighborhood - maybe the guys from Bowery Ballroom and Mercury Lounge could open something up here in Astoria!

				Hell Gate social has some &quot;interesting&quot; events that attract an even more interesting crowd...but you have to keep on top of what they have as it changes week to week.<br /><br />They had areally cool art show a couple of months back and displayed AMAZING local artwork. <br /><br />Also really dig the artists the Waltz showcases....but would love to learn of a few more..

				I know the Irish Rover on 38th Street and 28th Ave has live music a couple nights a week.&nbsp; Alot of times they have this Irish guy Maloney who place old Irish folk songs, reminds me of a one man Flogging Mollys.

				Forgot to mention Walt-Astoria.&nbsp; I&#039;d have to say that Hell Gate Social and Waltz-Astoria are the two greatest places for live music and hanging out in Astoria!
