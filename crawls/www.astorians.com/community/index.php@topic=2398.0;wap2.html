			like the title suggests share blogs here about each game, or your &quot;deep&quot; thoughts on the social, political, psychological, economic, spiritual, anthropologic essence of the world cup....how ambitious, i know...<br /><br />i&#39;ll post a couple of mine to start:<br /><br />Italy v. USA: hot headed game<br /><br />Well what can I say, perhaps as a direct result of the environment that I was watching the game in (Beer Garden full of revelers whose nationalist bravado gained momentum maturing into vintage hooliganism with each guzzled mug of beer) the match seemed ultra aggresive. Not so much because it had too many strong tackles or fist fights, although it did have some of the former, but mainly because a sense of unusual even by world cup standards urgency (bordering on desperation) carried in the way both teams played on the field today. <br /><br />Perhaps it was pride and the heavy weight of expectations that each team had to shoulder. For the Italians perhaps it was also a bit of the scandal ridden present of their soccer culture, but mainly it had to be a combination of their 70 year old history of being in the world&#39;s elit and most resented top teams and the unforgiving, zero sum &quot;affection&quot; of their national suporters. On the pitch this would roughly translate into an identity of player&#39;s as soldiers representing their tribe on the international stage; God forbid or rather &quot;hell awaits&quot; should the lowly soccer imposters of the otherwise vaunted America mess with that 70 year old mythology of what it means to be Italian. This later reality seems to have been eclipsed by delusions of granduer and clueless enthusiam on the part of the American soccer watching public and to some extent the team playing mentality as well. Seems like our collective fixation with wining has lead to irrational expectations to &quot;matter of factly&quot; repeat the miracle of &#39;02 when we finished in the top eight. But of course miracles are special if not singular occasions. Mythology on the other hand....is a hard won and hard fought victory of lasting bliss. It is perception built around laboriously accrued instances of self-validation and persistance rising to soaring heights of nationalism and self-esteem. In the Itlalians&#39; case that mythology is a leaning tower of Pisa. In America&#39;s case today our mythology smacked of Rambo, give or take a few red-card tackles, a bloodied face and a sometimes beligerant coach on the sidelines. In the end the old adage that this is more than just a game, which is usually reserved for the sublime imagery of Brazilian soccer culture, is so pattently true in the case of the world cup......and I suppose in all other world cup like human endeavors. Bring em on then. One nation&#39;s glorified notion of self takes on anothers.<br />

			#2<br /><br />does Brazil have a coach? <br /><br />The answer to that question is in the negative: Brazil does not have a coach. What Brazil does have is an unrully legacy and a taboo driven footbal hierarchy that looms far larger than any one coach could ever tame. It is an entrenched system of thought, an ideology which dictates implicitly what is and what should never be. Rule numero uno &quot;Don&#39;t f___ with the good old boy network&quot; because you are part of it. Ronaldo remains a superstar in the minds and psyche of Brazilian culture. The nation is not yet ready to let go of his legend. Like the blindness of passion or the clinging to a painful love affair that has ended long ago Ronaldo and the rest of us are being tortured by the experience of seeing him drag the corpse of his past-greatness around the field, but neither he nor his compatriots and even more so his so called coach in the national team are &quot;ready&quot; to face reality. I suppose reasoned thinking in any instsance where denial and taboo roam freely is usually lost in the face of other priorities. What is evidently clear is the wishful thinking that Brazil&#39;s coach Pereira eminates about Ronaldo&#39;s fitness and expired greatness and the fact that this delusion has turned into an embarassment that is almost certain to become a fiasco if someone doesn&#39;t put an end to it. What is most unfortunate is that it has clearly affected or should i say infected the rest of the team and fucked royally with its composure and chemistry. In my opinion, the psychological burden of carrying this 400 pound gorila with them every time they step onto the field makes the Brazilians less cohessive and less bonded. And frankly speaking i don&#39;t blame the players. It is a major distraction becasue it opens up a whole pandora&#39;s box of issues pertaining to group dynamics (selfishness, double standards etc.)<br /><br />Another significant factor contributing to distraction and spiritless team efforts by the brazilians and which btw is probably interrelated with the whole Ronaldo taboo is the mythology surrounding &quot;jogo bonito&quot; aka &quot;the beautiful game&quot; and the notion that Brazilians (and this national squad in particular) are gatekeeprs and protectors, heirs and rightful rulers of its legacy. I mean Ronaldinhio steping on the ball and faling down a few steps before scoring?? what was he thinking? certainly not the shortest distance to a goal, but perhaps a more dazling one. Self consciousness is the last thing that should be prescribed to or forced upon the Brazilian team when it comes to creating football chances. But of course their trials are just proof that they are human after all. We are all responsible in a way for having created this image of them that is even larger than the players themselves turning them into glorified and perhpas even deified objects. It&#39;s a sure way of ruining natural beauty and contaminating an otherwise flalwless footballing imagination with artificial expectation. It induces a kind of inadvertent but inevidable micromanagement, which for the Brazilian players stems from being more in tune with what the world&#39;s expectations are of them more so than being themselves. I am optimistc though...ok i&#39;m lying, i&#39;m just wishful like Pereira... that Robinho (Ronaldo&#39;s masterful 21 y/o heir) will enter the starting line up and we will finally allow the corpse of Ronaldo to be layed to rest in the dignified and trully respectful manner that it deserves. He has been nothing short of a phenomenon in his career and he hopefully will be remembered for that, as opposed to having suffered a less than dignified death at the &#39;06 world cup and becoming a story to scare children with.&nbsp; <br />

			an overwhelming repsonse to this open blog.....what a waiting list...<br /><br />blog numero tres:<br /><br />so Ronaldo scores: it&#39;s not his corpse any more it is his shadow<br /><br />yes indeed the goal scoring record for combined world cups has been tied by the footballer formally known as &quot;el fenomeno&quot; and order in the football universe has been restored if somewhat clumsily...the guy cannot, does not, and simply refuses to run, sprint, or otherwise pretend that he can get to the ball before his opponent...he spends about 40% of the time on his backside while on the pitch and amazingly still has the capacity to mesmerize oponents by virtue of his reputation even though the most he is capable of is jogging...... this is the same player who at the peak of his form seemed quicker than Flash Gordon (how dare I) and had more artistry on the pitch than Borishnikov did on the stage (double how dare I)....... he has been reduced by injury to a static threat with a great shot, diminished but still fancy footwork and a legend that affords him far more respect from opposing defenders than ordinary footballers. the only reason he is in the line up is the good old boy system of Brazilian football culture (see previous blog), which reminds me to just stop obsessing about Ronaldo....so hard to control myself sometimes....i can&#39;t help it though since i am as infatuated as everyone else with the poetic fantasy known as &quot;jogo bonito&quot; and i follow the Brazilian team like a good addict follows a utopian football high....<br /><br />in any case, if i&#39;m permitted to continue ranting somewhat aimlessly i&#39;d like to bitch some more.......this time it is about the apparent or self-concocted &quot;void&quot; i see between fans who folow the European leagues (the best international football there is) regularly and those who don&#39;t: aka average American fans....my apologies in advance for the blatantly elitist under and over-tones in this paragraph but i admit i am no humble man when it comes to this subject........it is of no big surprise to anyone who follows the Euro leagues that the Americans were no better than they showed in this tournament and that Ghana, for instance, which advanced at our expense, albeit, with a little help by the ref, was as good as it showed......of course at this level of play games are fluid and outcomes can sway either way..... but let us not be surprised with Ghana.........i mean Michael Essien, Steven Appiah, Amoah and company?? these are all solid players who have consistently proved their skills in top football teams in Europe and i mean top teams: Chelsea, Juventus, Borusia Dortmund etc. and perhaps most importantly have done so in the toughest/best leagues in the planet.<br /><br />A simple glance of the leagues/teams that Ghana players practice their craft in versus those of American squad players and it becomes plainly obvious that Ghana has a solid bunch of four or five players who compete, for example, in the Champions League (the top tournament in the planet on par with the world cup), whereas, Da Markus Beasley is the only USA player who does........so it shouldn&#39;t be a major surprise that Ghana beat us out today......once again these pseudo-rants are all about setting the record straight and frankly i can&#39;t blame fans here who simply do not have easy access to Euro leagues and have to go out of their way (Nevada Smith&#39;s on 3rd and 11 st.) to watch the best international football more regularly....and one last note about the USA team: they did REALLY WELL on the whole. they showed that American soccer is PROGRESSING (on the whole). when seen in a vacuum they did not do very well, but similarly to how the spirited 2002 world cup campaign was seen in a vacuum and therefore mislead people to believe that we&#39;ve become one of the top teams in the world we ought to avoid narrow conclusions and instead appreciate the game of soccer through its vast history, legacy, and depth....it just takes a lot more than six MLS seasons to build a lasting soccer culture ....not to mention an educated fan base....so team America keep your head up

			don&#39;t cry for me Espana<br /><br />blog numero quatro<br /><br />Ronaldo you are making me look bad :wink:....i still can&#39;t believe that goalies defenders and the footballing world in general keep falling for that classic step over move he made so popular, which admitedly is sooo sweet to watch..... even though he does it in slow mo nowadays (compared to the warp speed dance moves of his early days). but nevertheless, as much as i am jubilant about the intrigue of a possible el fenomeno come back, today i am more inclined to write about the ongoing melodrama known as the national team of Spain. i mean are there really any words with which to describe the very precedent setting tendency of Spanish national teams to simply loose by virtue of their own legacy? heartbreak after heartbreak after heartbreak ...... today&#39;s disappointment seems even worse considering that the team appears not to have learned anything from past lessons and to settle for humility and persistence as opposed to the hyped logic of an underachieving giant. they remind me a little of the impatience of an adolescent who wants to be seen and treated as an adult. <br /><br />consider exhibit (A): all the nonsensical hype before the France match fueled by such epic moments is Spanish football as having beaten neophyte Ukraine and two John Does of world soccer (meet Tunesia &amp; Saudi Arabia) by several goals. consider exhibit (B): Fernando Torres the rising star of Spanish football merely 22 y/o and with only scarce sensibility to show for his inexhaustible soccer talent prior to the France game was quoted as having implied a less than deferential insinuation about Zidan who at the twilight of his legendary career is hardly in need of acolades but can still produce mastery on the pitch.....and i would aver especially if crudely challenged about it. so pure naivette on the part of Mr Torres? unlikely....as far as the Spanish national football character is concerned imaturity is a lesson that keeps repeating until it is learned. <br /><br />of course, as i&#39;ve said before, at this level of football things are never simple. the game is dynamic, results can always sway and momentum usually supplants all other factors in affecting team morale and chemistry. the France team for instance, otherwise not short on individual talent, had a very good result prior to the game with Spain not so much because they beat a John Doe African team but because by advancing to the next round they partially quelled rummors that their best days were way behind them. after that the team had more of an insentive to bond together even more, put aside menial diferences that can loom large when results aren&#39;t favorable and if given a chance by a less than experienced opponent, or as in Spain&#39;s case a more self-absorbed one, to take advantage and do what they already know how to do very, very well: win important matches. <br /><br />looking ahead to Saturday&#39;s rematch of the &#39;98 final, as good as Brazil is (miles apart from its nearest rival) momentum can carry even a mostly unimpressive team like France, which with its quality footballers at this level is not incapable (a break or two and whole lot of team purpose provided) go from a big victory to an epic one...and beyond...stay tuned, Saturday&#39;s game between France and Brazil is a defining test for both teams just as today&#39;s was for Spain. only problem for the later was that somebody forgot to tell them that they can&#39;t pass this test before they actually play the game. la lucha continua...

			to be or not to be: Germany v. Argentina<br />blog # five<br /><br />I love this Monday morning quarterback stuff….it just makes me feel so smart and special all over!! But this time acting on the advice of my shrink (not really) I’ve decided to put an end to this charade of self-indulgence and speak before the actual game(s) are played. So here we go, it&#39;s Germany v. Argentina:<br /><br />I like my momentum theory (see previous blog) and am willing to put it to a test with these two. Germany keeps on keeping on mostly by feeding off their wining ways and subsequent joy of their home-crowd. Their team chemistry has really benefited insofar as they have not lost any games or fallen behind in the score (which makes me skeptical of how they will respond if down by a goal or two) and their play showed exponential improvement in the Sweden game. I was impressed! I admit it. But where does my momentum theory leave Argentina then? Well in not so good of a place if we were to judge them from their last (Mexico) game: flat, uninspiring, predictable and dare I say somewhat daunted. Yes, I know most mortals were keen to jump on the Argentina and every other bandwagon that rolled through this world cup early on during the group stage matches, but this is “win or go home” territory and there are no Saudi Arabias or Kosta Ricas left to showcase one’s “greatness” on. Thus, if team psychology from the previous game is any indication Argentina will have a tough time against the home team tomorrow. That having been said, I do expect that a seasoned and experienced team like Argentina will arrive on the field with added urgency and focus and that the game will be a close one with possible lead changes between the two teams and very likely an overtime or penalty kicks decision. <br /><br />It would not surprise me if we saw a 2-2 tie in regulation with both teams giving it their all and rewarding fans with heart and bravado during the match. I really do wish that players like Mesi and Tevez from Argentina would start though, rather than come off the bench, simply because they produce so much energy on the pitch and accelerate the pace and rhythm of the game so well. Their presence would allow for more goal chances and perhaps a more attacking friendly style. But the Argentinean coach is obviously not crazy and thus unconcerned with wishful fantasies about exciting, fast paced football and more interested in winning the cup. Argentina will likely start more conservatively than the Germans. I do expect more pressure by the later early on, which can help to make the game exciting still since the Argentina team has the potential for dangerous counter attacks and could score first. In such an instance we will surely see a more anxious yet entertaining game. My prediction is Germany wins: I love tango but Maradona will only be in the stands not on the field and I am still in disbelief over how fast the Germans were running in that Sweden game (I mean did they take something before the game or what?) as well as how flawless and strong their passing game was. <br /><br />As far as the Italy/Ukraine game is concerned I really wish FIFA would enact a rule against boring soccer play so that we wouldn’t have to waste our time with such games and instead I propose that we could just watch the Brazilian team practice…. or something like that. Needless to say of course that I hope I am dead wrong and that it turns out to be an ultra exciting game, but please don’t forget to exhale people………<br />
