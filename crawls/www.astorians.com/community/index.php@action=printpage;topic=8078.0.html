				I get emails from the&nbsp; &nbsp;Biden for President (http://www.joebiden.com/home) campaign. This morning they commented about this, calling out Rudy for crassly exploiting 9/11 again.&nbsp; They asked supporters to donate $20.08 to Biden instead.

It&#039;s a mistake to just assume this is the case.<br /><br />Frankly, I have no problem with him receiving money from people who want to pay to hear him talk about 9/11. I don&#039;t see what is immoral about it. There are people who really like him, who want to see him run for office, who were impressed by his role in addressing the 9/11 crisis, who want him to rise to national prominence based largely on this. They throw a party for other like-minded people and they pay for his time. He sets a price, if they want to pay it, they do. If they don&#039;t, they don&#039;t. You would be okay if he went on a speaking tour and turned away donations, or directed them to charities. But what if the people giving the money to him want him to use it for his campaign, or want him to keep it as their way of expressing gratitude for what he did. I just don&#039;t see what&#039;s immoral about this, sorry. <br /><br />Reasonable people can both criticize and praise his performance as mayor. I happen to disagree with his stand on the war and I think that his negligence after the first WTC attack in upgrading the intercommunication technology of the police/fire department/emt services is inexcusable. He was also a reassuring presence on 9/11 and during its immediate aftermath.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />In the spirit of tit-for-tat, the Democrats regularly scaremonger about what will happen if the government doesn&#039;t feed or house people, what will happen if they don&#039;t socialize health care, support the teachers&#039; unions, etc.<br /><br />Republicans and Democrats are equal opportunity exploiters of baseless scare tactics, mon ami.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I think the tactic shows a lack of imagination among Giuliani&#039;s fundraisers. My inclination is that was in poor taste, but I chalk that up to 9/11-fatigue.

				People who host fundraising events for candidates usually don&#039;t work for the campaign. Many of them volunteer their time (and their connections...&nbsp; :mrgreen: ) to bring folks together, pass the hat or whatever, and kick it upstairs to a campaign committee, usually a state organization.<br /><br />The guy behind this controversial event isn&#039;t the same person that Giuliani replaced.

				Although in bad taste, perhaps the fundraiser just doesn&#039;t know any better :(&nbsp; I do think Guiliani did a good job with 9/11 but he&#039;s good at telling people what to do, taking charge, and being all dictator-like.&nbsp; It&#039;s a joke, lol.&nbsp; I find it annoying that it&#039;s being used as a campaign booster, but I didn&#039;t really expect much else.&nbsp; He&#039;ll say whatever he can to get elected, most politicians do.&nbsp; Look how he&#039;s fallen all over himself telling the NRA he loves the Second Amendment.&nbsp; His record as mayor said otherwise, but hey, guess you can always change your mind when it&#039;s convenient for you.

				While Giuliani probably had nothing to do with the &quot;theme&quot; and has tried to distance himself from it, which I think is the right thing to do, he could go a step further and say he won&#039;t take checks in that amount.&nbsp; If he really was trying to not use 9-11 as a fundraising tool, I think that is what he should be doing.
