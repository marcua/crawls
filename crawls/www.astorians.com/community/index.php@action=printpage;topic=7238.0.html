				Hello everyone!<br /><br />As some of you may know, for the past 6 years, I&#039;ve been the Astoria organizer for a world-wide event called The September Concert.<br /><br />The goal of the September Concert is to bring people together each September 11 with a message of peace through the healing power of music.&nbsp; Events take place all over the city, as well as in Japan, Ghana, Italy, Indonesia, the UK and many cities around the U.S.&nbsp; More information including photos and video from past events can be found here:&nbsp; http://www.septemberconcert.org.<br /><br />Since 2002, I&#039;ve placed volunteer musicians at about 10 small businesses in the neighborhood, mostly along Ditmars and Steinway, though I&#039;d love to see more of the neighborhood involved.&nbsp; Once again, I&#039;m looking for volunteer musicians, and would also like to extend an invitation to any local business owners on this list who&#039;d like to participate.&nbsp; <br /><br />Although in the past I&#039;ve placed musicians at venues, this year, I&#039;d like to streamline the process by inviting people to arrange their own events as well.&nbsp; Are you a singer-songwriter who frequents a neighoborhood restaurant?&nbsp; Why not ask them if they&#039;d be willing to let you play?&nbsp; Are you a cafe owner who knows that some of your regular customers are musicians?&nbsp; Ask them if they&#039;ll stop by to share some songs.&nbsp; The only requirement is that all events must be free and open to the public.&nbsp; This is an all-volunteer effort.&nbsp; It&#039;s really about the spirit of community.&nbsp; If you plan an event, please email me at septemberastoria@allisontartalia.com, so that I can be sure your event is included on the September Concert website and in any printed materials (last year all of the events were listed in the Daily News).<br /><br />Venues do not have to be traditional music venues.&nbsp; Past venues have included cafes, restaurants, a take-out noodle shop, bagel shops, and a haircutting place, where the owner each year plays outside between hair appointments!&nbsp; It&#039;s really open for all kinds of involvement, whether you play classical, jazz, bluegrass, pop or are a singer-songwriter; whether you make music for a living, or as a hobby.&nbsp; Since many of these untraditional &quot;venues&quot; don&#039;t have a PA system, anything unplugged is especially welcome!!!!<br /><br />Feel free to email me either here or at septemberastoria@allisontartalia.com for more information or if you&#039;d like to be a performer or venue.<br /><br />Thanks so much!<br />Allison<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Would anyone like to put together a little chorus/choir for this?&nbsp; It could be a really great experience.&nbsp; Mixture of readers and non-readers would be welcome.&nbsp; Thinking 8 people or so.&nbsp; Let me know if you&#039;re interested!

				Hi Meg,<br /><br />This sounds like a wonderful idea!&nbsp; <br /><br />Nice to meet you, by the way.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had a long time obsession with the harpsichord and keep hoping to make it to one of your shows eventually.<br /><br />Best,<br />Allison
