				Yikes.<br /><br />Just went to the opening night of the annual Venison Fest.&nbsp; It was really, really horrible.&nbsp; I have been to Zlatha Praha before and had an excellent Goose entre.&nbsp; But this was bad.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ordered Venison loin in a garlic sauce and should have been tipped off when the server walked off without asking how I wanted it cooked.&nbsp; We also had to remind him that our meal came with soup.&nbsp; He didn&#039;t know what kind of soup they had to serve.&nbsp; Thought it was goulash, it wasn&#039;t.&nbsp; When the entree came, the Venison seemed like it had been simmering in broth for about 5 days.&nbsp; So overstewed it was dry.&nbsp; The garlic, which was a major component of the meal, was clearly minced garlic from a jar.&nbsp; You can taste the difference.<br /><br />Waitstaff were very confused except for a 10 year old girl who was bussing tables and expediting things.&nbsp; She seemed to be helping the adult staff work the computers/register.&nbsp; She was very sweet and was the one to finally come by our table and ask if we wanted a check.&nbsp; The place was not even full, so it wasn&#039;t <em>that </em> busy.<br /><br />We were never offered the pastry and coffee that came with our meal.<br /><br />The Pilsner Urquell was good.<br /><br /><br />We spent $40 a person.&nbsp; Petey&#039;s, Tastee Corner, or the The Taco King on 33rd (my Bro) would have been much better and much cheaper.<br />

				yeah, i was there last night too.&nbsp; Very disappointing.&nbsp; Had the cold venison appetizer which consisted of two kinds of rather tasteless sausage and bland pate.&nbsp; the soup was actually pretty good.&nbsp; It was hunters soup with small slices of meat and some cabbage.&nbsp; The venison loin with garlic.&nbsp; Well, it was one chop and a piece of meat that included a piece of vertabrae.&nbsp; it was dry and tasteless as mentioned above.&nbsp; Also, aren&#039;t there laws about child labor?&nbsp; The girl working there...and she was indeed working the hardest in the place was no more than 10-11.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Haven&#039;t been to Zlata Praha before, and had been planning a small group outing sometime soon.&nbsp; Not as excited after reading these posts.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been to Koliba a couple of times recently and have really enjoyed it.&nbsp; How do these two places compare?

				Haven&#039;t been to Zlata but we were very impressed with Koliba. It&#039;s upscale-cozy, ski lodge-type atmosphere, but with hearty, tasty food. Been a while since our visit, sorry I can&#039;t remember the details. But I have been wanting to go back.

				Every comment I&#039;ve ever heard, including from Czech people, is that Koliba is much better.

				Koliba is wonderful!&nbsp; I&#039;ve always had delicious food there.&nbsp; Sorry the venison feast at Zlata Praha was so disappointing.

				Would you consider Koliba to be a kid friendly place during the day?&nbsp; Or is it more of a bar setting?

				During the day, I can&#039;t imagine it would be a problem. At night, they probably wouldn&#039;t kick you out, but please think about the other diners (we spent a lot on a fancy meal last night, and somebody brought their newborn along.)

				We&#039;ve fought about this before. (http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=10992.0)<br /><br />This thread is about Zlata Praha. For those of you looking for a debate on whether or not parents should bring their kids to restaurants please continue the conversation in the thread above.

				It&#039;s all fun and games until someone loses an eye...<br /><br />The parents and children posts have been merged into the thread posted by merm. If you wish to continue that discussion do so there -- and please, as nicely as possible.<br /><br />This thread is about Zlata Praha<br /><br />...and now back to our regularly scheduled program.
