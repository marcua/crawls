				One of my favorite foods in the world is fried zucchini blossoms with mozarella and anchovies inside. The problem is that it is practically impossible to find zucchini blossoms in NY, even when they are in season.<br /><br />So my question is (and I know it is a little early, but I figured I would throw it out there now)- do any of you people out there with gardens grow zucchini? and if so, would you be willing to let me take your blossoms if you don&#39;t eat them... I promise to share the fried yummy goodness... I may even be willing to make them without anchovies.<br /><br />Marta

				Mmmmmmm.<br /><br />My late (Italian) husband turned me on to this.<br /><br />But, making them without anchovies is sacrilegious.<br /><br />Have you checked out the greengrocers on Ditmars? They used to sell them, in season, for the local Italian aficionados.<br /><br />NYCMacUser

				I don&#39;t have a garden, but I&#39;ll trek out to the Union Square greenmarket to hunt for them when the time comes.&nbsp; It goes without saying that my share of the end product will be considered part of the deal.<br /><br />(I&#39;ve been wanting to make squash blossom soup for the longest time)

I don&#39;t really cook with recipes, but they are very simple to make.. you just clean the blossom and stick a piece of mozarella and an anchovy inside, then you dip them in a batter made with water, flour, salt and a litlle white wine or beer, and fry.<br />They are super yummy!

The only place where I ever found them, &lt;once&gt;, was at fairway at 125th street about 5 years ago. My only hope is that since restaurants are now starting to serve them they will start appearing in shops as well. <br /><br />I have also asked the locals, but perhaps I will try again and be a bit more persistent. <br /><br />otherwise I am coming to raid your garden :)

				I have definitely seen them at the Union Square Greenmarket.&nbsp; (With which I really have no affiliation.&nbsp; Honest.)<br /><br />But Jonathan&#39;s back yard is closer.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />If Jim and I get our act in gear and finish cleaning out our meager strip of land in the back, we could conceivable try to grow some, too.&nbsp; Is any particular variety recommended over another for the best blossoms?

				I remember last summer the farmers market in LIC had a stand where they sold zucchini blossoms.&nbsp; They looked too pretty to eat.&nbsp; I don&#39;t know how to cook with them, but I had had them once with a garlic ricotta filling.&nbsp; YUM!&nbsp; Hopefully that farmer will be back this summer.&nbsp; As much as I love the Union Sq F.M it&#39;s good to support our local F.M. (plus, it&#39;s closer to home).

				My neighbors who own the corner plot at 43rd Street and 25th Avenue have a huge garden.&nbsp; They grow zuchini flowers every year.&nbsp; They take up the entire garden and I&#39;m sure they don&#39;t use them all.&nbsp; They are such nice folks and wave to me all summer.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />It&#39;s worth stopping by to ask...

				What a great topic...<br /><br />My family in Sicily always makes Fiori di Zucca stuffed with fresh ricotta and not mozzarella, which I highly recommend. Ricotta is a bit lighter.&nbsp; The flowers themselves are fairly easy to obtain from the vast selection of Italian oriented Astoria produce markets in the summer. These differences in recipes are usually regional and it is quite interesting to compare the difference/alterations in ingredients.<br /><br />Buon Appetito!<br /><br />
