				A while back, there were small signs on the door and one of the windows of El Olivo, stating that it would be closed for renovations.&nbsp; After a relatively long time, the signs are now gone, but there is still white paper completely obliterating anyone&#039;s view of the interior.&nbsp; Does anyone know if a different restaurant will actually be taking over the location or is there just a delay in renovations?

				Wow, I didn&#039;t know this.&nbsp; It&#039;s a tough location, though Wave Thai seems to do okay.&nbsp; Their food was delicious and the service was friendly.&nbsp; It suffered a bit from a tired look and style.&nbsp; I wonder if they will come back with a makeover?&nbsp; I think most of us know that &quot;closed for renovations&quot; usually means &quot;gone for good&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m glad we still have El Boquer√≥n and La Rioja for good Spanish cuisine.

				I would be very disappointed if El Olivo were to go away.&nbsp; The food is great, the drinks are the best in town, and the service is even better.&nbsp; Ricardo and his family are part of the neighborhood.&nbsp; &nbsp;My wife and I have eaten here countless times.

				El Olivo opens TODAY at noon.&nbsp; My wife and I enjoyed a sneak preview last night, and it was astonishing.&nbsp; The new menu has so many great options, with most of the traditional El Olivo favorites still available.&nbsp; The new space is so bright and very modern looking.&nbsp; For those who were fans of the armor and swords, they retained one panel of swords.&nbsp; I think El Olivo 2.0 is going to draw a lot of new customers, without alienating the current clientele.&nbsp; And that first sip of sangria was worth the wait.&nbsp;

				The bar itself is about the same size.&nbsp; But they did get rid of the closet that was near the bar, and set up a couple of two seat hightops.&nbsp;
