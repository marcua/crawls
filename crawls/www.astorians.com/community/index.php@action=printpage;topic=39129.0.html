				Does anyone know what&#039;s happening with Last Stop?&nbsp; Their gate was down early last night, and today the &quot;Closed&quot; sign was up, and no one answered the phone.&nbsp; I&#039;m afraid the moment I&#039;ve feared for some time has happened, that Last Stop is the next 31st Street shop to shut its doors.&nbsp; They&#039;re never very busy, but I love their pizza.&nbsp; Say it ain&#039;t so!

				I heard that they were struggling and that they closed.&nbsp; I am so sad to hear about this.&nbsp; I loved their chicken parmigiana hero.&nbsp; The Italian food there was really good and so were the prices.&nbsp; I&#039;m going to miss this place.&nbsp; There isn&#039;t any good place for pizza in the Ditmars area.&nbsp; I&#039;m hoping that if Last Stop doesn&#039;t reopen they will open a good pizza place in there or a good Italian restaurant since they already have a pizza oven in there.

				I hope that they were wrong, but someone told me they will be opening an organic bakery in there.&nbsp; We sure don&#039;t need an organic bakery right across the street from Rose and Joe&#039;s

				This spot was good, not great.&nbsp; &nbsp;I liked their Spinach Pie Quesadilla.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s sad to see another neighborhood staple go away.

				Oh my, that&#039;s sad to hear&nbsp; :embarrassed:&nbsp; &nbsp;the older brother who I would see most times when I passed by was always cordial towards me as serious as he appears.&nbsp; I used to frequent that place back in the day.&nbsp; On one of my last dining visits, he handed me a fresh squeeze OJ and said, &quot;you have a cold? you drink Orange Juice, good for you.&quot;<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m going to have to ask my contact to see if they are actually closing shop ...
