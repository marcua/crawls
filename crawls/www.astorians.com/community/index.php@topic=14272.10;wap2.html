			Go to your local Key Food/Rite Aid/etc in the evening (like after 7) and ask them if they have any boxes you can have. You can get a variety of nice, sturdy ones, some with dividers of all sizes. They&#039;re boxes that their product shipments come in, and they just sit around until someone cuts them up and puts them outside at night. This is really the best way to do it.
