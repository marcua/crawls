				I live in a building where the owners have decided to renovate each unit after the tenants leave. I think that&#39;s great. Everything in my apartment was new when I moved in.<br /><br />However, the unit to one side of me is apparently undergoing renovation now and the workers appear to make noise after 6 PM. So, I am treated to a nightly serenade of hammering, drilling, banging, and the like. It often continues, like now, until well after 9 PM.<br /><br />This irks me to no end, so I did some Internet digging. (Which is completely noiseless, I might add.) I found this website www.nonoise.org (http://www.nonoise.org) It has a link to the New York City Department of Environmental Protection Noise Code from 1998. It reads in part:<br /><br />24-224 Construction activities. <br />(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, <strong>no person shall engage in or permit any person to be engaged in construction activities in any zone other than on weekdays between the hours of seven a.m. and six p.m</strong>. A person may, however, engage in construction activities on one or two family dwellings, convents or rectories, which are classified in occupancy group, J-3 as defined by section 27-266 of the administrative code, on Saturdays and Sundays between the hours of ten a.m. and four p.m. Such activities, however, must be located a distance of three hundred or more feet from a house of worship.<br /><br />This is the link to the whole code: http://www.nonoise.org/lawlib/cities/newyork.htm#224 (http://www.nonoise.org/lawlib/cities/newyork.htm#224)<br /><br />I guess I want to know if there is anything I can do and if this code is legit. Would I be able to call the building owners and see if they have some kind of permit for after hours construction? <br /><br />I hate this building!! :ticked:<br /><br />(Sorry, rant over.)

				Definitely call the landlord.&nbsp; Tell them what&#39;s going on.&nbsp; If they don&#39;t cooperate, call the city and file a formal complaint.&nbsp; Tell the landlord you&#39;re going to do so.&nbsp; They shouldn&#39;t be doing construction past 6.

				I&#39;d also call 311 and let them report it to the DOB. Be sure to get a case number.
