				For the recent arrivals who have recently discovered and ventured to our fair shores –&nbsp; Some history about the neighborhood in case you didn’t know… <br /><br /><strong>The ‘smell’</strong><br />Who the heck needs an alarm clock when you have ‘the smell’ to greet you each morning? The tide goes out and the smell comes in – voila! – eyes a poppin’ and nose a waterin’. I remember a study was done when I was in grade school, some government agency, the EPA or the Port Authority I think, gave out ‘smell-o-meters’ to a few residents so they could measure the smell and the study confirmed what everyone already knew (don’t they always?) – Flushing Bay around the airport was not so flushing anymore. They dredged the muck around the airport and Bowery Bay and the odor abated somewhat. Aside from the unfortunate stretch of stench when the boilers went out at the sewage plant recently, it’s been almost rosy compared to what I remember growing up. Don’t worry -- you’ll get used to the smell, and, after 20-30 years of living here, won’t even notice it that much.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Astoria Pool</strong><br />A melee at Astoria pool? Yeah it’s been 100 degrees for weeks but now I know it’s summer! Let’s go! If you were lucky enough to experience one of these free-for-alls you can proudly claim you are practically native Astorian. There’s at least one, sometimes two to three per summer. Temperatures and tempers flare and a few hundred people baking in the heat do not a picture of tranquillity make. Scary yes, but at least no one was stabbed or shot. Who said quality of life isn’t improving?<br /><br /><strong>Motorcycle racing</strong><br />Ah boys and their toys. Guys think that making the biggest spectacle of themselves as they can will attract the ladies but the truth is it only attracts other guys…plus hasn’t the thought crossed your minds that the louder the bike means the smaller the penis? They&nbsp; say it pays to advertise but really, why a guy would want to call attention to himself in this way? Well, again it’s not summer until the bikes come out. Racing/noise has been a problem for as long as I can remember, especially down by the park. Sometimes the cops close off Shore Boulevard to help control the problem but it’s a short-term fix that usually results in the riders moving to other parts of the neighbourhood to annoy the people elsewhere. Complaints have been made; committees have been organized but nothing much is done about it – unless we outlaw motorcycle sales to young male between the ages of 18-24. Turn up the Air con, turn up the TV and tune out (and buy ear plugs).<br /><br /><strong>Book store</strong><br />I hate to shatter the dream but I feel I must. It’s better you know this now to avoid heartbreak in the future so here it goes: There has never been and probably will never be a decent bookstore in Astoria. Give this thought up right this minute and save yourselves a lot of pain and aggravation. Until recently the population has been mostly working class, largely immigrant, and for the most part non-English as a first language speaking and the demographics just never worked to support one. Where did B&amp;N open their stores when they first expanded into Queens? –Forest Hills and Bayside, neighbourhoods with people with higher incomes and better educations. It’s just the way it is. Accept it and move on.<br /><br /><strong>Architecture</strong><br />The darkest day in Astoria architectural history was not the day they erected a five story apartment house in the middle of a beautiful run of row houses on 36th street but much longer ago, in the early 70s when the Loews Triboro theatre – the one screen, 3290 seat movie palace, on the corner on 28th Avenue and Steinway – that was demolished and replaced by the most undistinguished, uninspired stretch of shops and apartments were imagined. All I can say to the buildings of Astoria is avert your eyes and learn to love. There’s small apartment building and house on the corner of 33rd street and 31st avenue where, after the initial feelings of revulsion, you just can’t help but love – c’mon the spectacle, the pizzazz, the balls it took to clad your property in pink, grey and white flagstones. Astoria was never really an architectural hotspot but we have (had) our gems. I don’t know what to say but I just wish the esthetics could improve. What does it cost a developer to add some distinction to a simple two- to three-family row house? Peanuts I think. But my beef is at the people who buy them. You get what you pay for. It’s sad when the quite plain row house that I grew up in can be considered downright pretty compared to the monstrosities going up today. Oh well, if you travel to Italy, Greece and dare I say Ireland (I was in Dublin a few months ago) not the pretty parts mind you where the tourist and the well-off live but the areas with the ‘real’ people you’ll find you haven’t left home.<br /><br /><strong>Shops and cafes</strong><br />What’s the problem? Real stores that sell real things -- not boutiques that sell useless items at ridiculous prices. At least we don’t have empty storefronts which was about to be a problem not so long ago. I know we could do without another .99 store, or a nail salon, or a cell phone store, or a bank – it’s all so boring but they wouldn’t open if people in the neighbourhood didn’t frequent them. At least we don’t have to deal with high-end shops that sell designer-ware for people’s pets or too-cool-for-school cafes filled to the brim with hipsters and wanna-bes, dressed in the same clothes, reading the same things (if they could find a bookstore that is), and droning on about whatever they drone about. Okay, maybe one of those places would be nice but when one opens it’s only too soon before we&#39;re overrun. I don’t know, I may not sip my coffee at some of the euro-cafes but a part of me is glad they’re there.&nbsp;<br /><br />Come and enjoy Astoria..we have the park, the waterfront, and a beer garden...what else matters?<br />

				(Erin Lippincott was a reporter for the Queens Chronicle for a few years: she covered Western Queens and lived off Broadway in the 40s. Written before she moved out west in 2002)<br /><br />Why I Don’t Really Hate Queens <br />E.E. Lippincott (NYC)<br /><br />I hate the borough of Queens or, more accurately, until last week I hated the borough of Queens. <br /><br />It&#39;s an unsightly place, full of the pollution that the rest of New York City won&#39;t tolerate being produced in its backyard. It&#39;s full of immigrants who may or may not take their new country seriously. It&#39;s full of longtime United States citizens, who decided decades ago that with as little learning and bravery and creativity as possible they could just about avoid any progress. <br /><br />It’s full of large, dirty thoroughfares, two huge airports and a second-rate baseball stadium. It&#39;s decorated in cheap wrought iron and gaudy fake-gold appliqué, like a prize out of a 25 cent machine in a grocery store. <br /><br />Buildings keep going up all over the place as rents in Manhattan become too severe and people move east towards Queens and Long Island. And that construction is of the poorest quality possible because the entire borough has been put up for sale by the smalltime crooks who are elected to run it. Families hand down run-down diner or restaurant dynasties to their offspring. <br /><br />Newspapers are bought out by the advertisers or the politicians who pay for their printing. <br /><br />The old ladies, Italian or Greek or German, sit on their front porches and are very sure they know exactly the way life should be and why you are not acceptable. The men make a lot of talk about what they won&#39;t tolerate and how they&#39;re not afraid to stand up to so and so and then quietly, with harsh lined faces, let themselves be hoodwinked again and again. <br /><br />It&#39;s a place of sit down and shut up and don&#39;t you dare talk back you&#39;d better like what&#39;s coming to you. It&#39;s a place that refers to Manhattan, the next borough over and often plainly visible on the horizon, as &quot;the city.&quot;<br /><br />It&#39;s a borough full of losers. It&#39;s a borough made to be suckered. I hated it because I felt I was suckered too. No man is an island, so they say, but its very easy to get walled off onto what you think is an island. It&#39;s easy to loose sight of the rest of the world, and instead become blinded to everything but the few opportunities in your immediate sphere. <br /><br />About two years ago I embraced a job as a reporter covering a culture that was different from anything I&#39;d ever seen before. The Queens woman: her hair permed and teased into a ball framing her metallic, rose-tinted glasses. How exotic. <br /><br />The well-groomed Queens man: clean shaven, often with a mustache, and leaving a scent trail of cologne behind him. The wide &#39;ahs&#39; in the word &quot;horror&quot; and &quot;radiator&quot; enchanted me. <br /><br />The long dirty streets with their crazed traffic, the kids from the projects who soup up their cars and race them, one block at a time between stop lights, the manner of the butcher and the shifty eyed behavior of everyone in the traditional Italian bakeries thrilled me to the bone. <br /><br />I was a stranger in a strange land. I was an anthropologist.<br /><br />I&#39;m not quite sure how it happened, but somehow I became caught somewhere along the line and enmeshed within the culture I was studying. I was breathing the Queens air, I&#39;d moved to the Queens neighborhood of Astoria. I was faced day in and day out with the conversation of Queensites. I felt I had lost the larger view of life. I guess for a brief time, kicking and screaming, I became a Queensite too. It was horrible. It reached gnashing-teeth level about three weeks ago, as I stood in line at the Steinway Post Office. As I waited I composed the following tome to my disgust.<br /><br />Post Office On Broadway, Queens<br /><br />Even the children look stern<br />at a post office in Queens.<br />Men, the bags beneath their eyes hard won at 40,<br />stand silently in the line that always stretches out into the street.<br /><br />Women from Yugoslavia try to be polite to the tellers <br />while struggling to get a money order<br />which will send their American dollars far away.<br /><br />The tellers, also do not speak English, <br />behind the scratched plastic walls.<br /><br />Girls, wherever they were born, waiting primly <br />neatly put together in cheap imitations <br />of today’s fashions.<br /><br />A Hispanic man, his wavy hair immaculately parted <br />in some 1950s method<br />attempts to retain his dignity at the window, <br />his cravat around his neck.<br /><br />He is reduced to awkward straining <br />because the Post Office is not a dignified place <br />and his English is still not so good.<br /><br />A middle-aged woman, her hair hennaed red, stares <br />at the girls with an unpleasant face.<br /><br />When she speaks, her voice is too young <br />to match her sagging flesh and harsh lines. <br /><br />Two young boys, their hair and skin look dusty, <br />are very quiet as they wait for their mother. <br /><br />They smile but there is no play here<br />where an old Indian man waits an hour <br />to buy one 34 cent stamp.<br /><br />But you can’t sum a whole culture up in disgust—can’t turn your nose up at an entire world. <br /><br />What’s so bad about Queen anyway? <br /><br />In terms of New York, it isn’t as decayed and suffering as Harlem. It isn’t as dirty and isolated as parts of Brooklyn. It isn’t racially divided like the Bronx. It isn’t ignored like Staten Island. It isn’t congested with cars and insipid small talk like parts of Manhattan. <br /><br />Queens is pretty mild compared to a lot of other places in this town. It isn&#39;t lovely or inspiring but it isn’t THAT BAD. <br /><br />I hated Queens because I had gotten stuck in Queens. I had an apartment I’d invested in, I had a car I had to make payments on. I had a job that sucked all the energy out of me so at the end of the day I didn&#39;t have the drive to go anywhere. Feeling trapped is an awful feeling. I would have hated heaven if I’d felt trapped there. <br /><br />So while what I saw at the post office is true, from a slightly different perspective it could have been fascinating rather than damning. The proud Hispanic man may have seemed dapper and touching. The young girls’ mimicry of expensive fashions may have struck me as ingenious. The whole scene could have been proof of the resilience of pop culture or that cultures make small improvements on a concept in order to make it their own. It could have been a very different poem. <br /><br />I am leaving New York City within the next couple of months to seek out adventure in other parts of the globe. I made the decision last week. I will most definitely miss being a daily part of this crazy, mile-a-minute town, which I truly love. Maybe when I visit again I’ll put some time aside to make a special trip to Queens. <br /><br />I imagine then, I’ll see something quite different.<br />

I had. It was such a joy to be inside surrounded by all that grandeur. She had supplied every housewife in the neighborhood with a full set of dishes and glassware and even silverware with serving pieces; every kid with Saturday morning cartoons and a feature film for only 25 cents; every teen a resplendent place to graduate Junior High or High School from; everyone a place to cool off on those brutally hot summer days and nights. With wide comfortable seats, a screen bigger than most neighborhood houses, the Loew&#39;s Triboro Theatre will always be missed by those of us who grew up in her awe.<br /><br />In her place are some miserable stores and a few living spaces above them. <br /><br />I intentionally avoid going past the intersection of 28th Avenue and Steinway Street. It breaks my heart.

				I wish we could see more pictures.&nbsp; It sounds beautiful.&nbsp; I just don&#39;t get people destroying their history.&nbsp; I visited Las Vegas a few years back and was very surprised by their approach to historic preservation, there didn&#39;t seem to be any - they tore down the old casinos and didn&#39;t seem to care (along the strip at least).&nbsp; It&#39;s always surprising to see this happen in NYC, though I guess it happened more in the 70s and 80s than these days, not that landmarked buildings are always protected now.&nbsp; There is a really wretched developer in the East Village who is gutting the details from a landmarked building as the community is fighting his plans to put a dorm there - it&#39;s just appalling behavior.&nbsp; He bought the building from the Giuliani administration, taking it from a well-loved community based organization.

				I agree NYCMACuser...it was a dark day. The Triboro was special --grand, galmorous. I was in single digits age-wise but remember it well -- it was exciting to just walk in the door, no matter what movie was playing. I read somewhere though that it was torn down in the 60s, this can&#39;t be correct? It had to be the early 70s?<br />...and compared the Astoria theatre, well there was no comparison. The Astoria was a dump, even when it was a single screen, though I admit it was another institution I was sad to see go.

				Well, there&#39;s the Greek monastery (orthodox) and the Greek church on 33rd.&nbsp; There&#39;s a big Catholic church on Ditmars at 29th street, too.&nbsp; Also Russian Orthodox church on 37th.&nbsp; There must be a bunch of other Greek O churches in town, too.&nbsp; Don&#39;t know if the Lutherans or Presbyterians do up First Communion.&nbsp; Anyway, I think it&#39;s possible for the stores to have enough business here in the Ditmars area.

				Take a look at photos from 50 or 70 years ago. The buildings were beautiful when built. Walk around Sunnyside Gardens or Boulevard Gardens. Queens was the nation&#39;s laboratory for planned communities during the first half of the last century.<br /><br />Back 30 years ago some of the places you admire in Brooklyn were hell holes. Battered, graffiti covered, dangerous. They look different now. Why?<br /><br />Today Queens had 10 times more illegal conversions than any other borough. Front yards are paved over, trees cut down, basements a rabbit warren of cells, and the cheapest lowest quality of housing is encouraged. Check out the blogs around the city: Queens in general, and Astoria in particular, is now a laughing stock when it comes to urban style.<br /><br />The problem is our leadership is stale and complacent. The have bred apathy in the public. The papers churn out one real estate puff piece after another. You would think that Elmhurst is a delight compared to Williamsburg.<br /><br />Its up to you to demand something better.<br /><br />

				oh give it a rest today would ya?&nbsp; Im only talking about Astoria.&nbsp; Relax.&nbsp; there is a lot of truth in what Im saying here. Nothing wrong with it and nothing wrong with just letting it be.<br /><br />I dont care about the politics of it or your useless ranting or your lack on conversation skills or your inability to answer a question.<br /><br />I was just giving my opinion about my love for Astroia and lack of great architecture. And it doesnt have to include anyone of us writing a letter or petition to the government in order to express one self.

				Before we came to Astoria, we used to live in a gorgeous loft apartment in Brooklyn. Bushwick. The neighborhood was so craptacular and dangerous and ghettoized and depressing that I used to wish we could transplant that big beautiful (old opera house) apartment building to a bettter neighborhood. One like Astoria. Yes, the architecture here is abhorrent. Seriously, its bad. On par with parts of LA (ha! Jonathan you looooove it). But in this neighborhood we found something we couldn&#39;t find in our luxe Bushwick loft: friends (and places to hang with them where we won&#39;t be stabbed)! For that, I can live with Astoria&#39;s ugly, decaying, roach-infested buildings. But yeah, Fort Greene is nice.

				I happen to live a on a block that reminds me of Glen Park in SF, believe it or not.&nbsp; Lots of different kinds of buildings, some average looking, and some really really good looking (like Derek Zoolander!).&nbsp; I love the building across the street from my apartment because apart from its interesting architectural ornament, it has the old numbering system chiseled into the front entryway.&nbsp; Very cool.&nbsp; The building next to it is also a nice old brick apt. bldg that looks cool, too.&nbsp; The landlords just painted the fire escapes and they look great.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have an awesome landlord that keeps the place really in great shape.&nbsp; It&#39;s not the prettiest house, but it&#39;s clean, bug free, rat free, and the grounds are tidy.&nbsp; It&#39;s a fine house, and structurally sound.&nbsp; Trash and recycling are all taken care of and things never look amiss.&nbsp; Down the street I often hear a guy noodling on his electric guitar, which is fun.&nbsp; A little bit before and across from him is a house that looks like it belongs in Cambridge, MA.&nbsp; There are row houses, too.<br /><br />I live close to two subway stations, numerous wonderful restaurants, a 10 minute walk to Astoria Park, am within walking distance to lots of friends, and there&#39;s public art everywhere around where I live.&nbsp; I live in a community.<br /><br />I learned a long time ago that &quot;home&quot; is more than just the way a building looks.&nbsp; Some of the coolest places look completely different inside than they do outside.&nbsp; It&#39;s really not always about the way something looks that makes it worthy.&nbsp; I think most of us do realize this.&nbsp; I love my home in Astoria.<br /><br />Brooklyn and Queens are so different in their makeup.&nbsp; I like the fact that Queens is a collection of individual towns and cities, rather than Brooklyn, which is one entity.&nbsp; It&#39;s logical that Queens has a lack of consistency.&nbsp; And it&#39;s ok.<br /><br />I love living in Astoria with all its quirkiness! :lol:
