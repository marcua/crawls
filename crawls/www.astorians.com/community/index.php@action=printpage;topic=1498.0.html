				I wonder if they have fans blowing the odor onto the street.&nbsp; Why don&#39;t you smell bread cooking from the bakery across the street?&nbsp; I wonder if it&#39;s actually even bread that we smell, or some chemicals they pump into the air infront of their stores.

				I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s chemicals. I&#39;ve read that Dunkin Donuts does that too, but at least their chemicals smell delicious (if that&#39;s true, anyway). For Subway I think it works against them. It smells absolutely putrid. I almost threw up from walking past a Subway on a hot, humid summer night because of this.

				i think it&#39;s a shame that there is another &#39;chain&#39; fast food place coming to our neck of the woods. here in ASTORIA. there is so much diversity in food and places all around, why do we need chains?!<br /><br />ever since i moved to NYC, i refuse to eat at chain food places. there&#39;s no reason to.&nbsp; NYC is the heart of awesome food. <br /><br />anyway, i&#39;m rambling. <br /><br />i have a fantasy that people will boycott subway sandwich shop and keep going to all the awesome delis and other places around here for their sandwiches. <br /><br />after-all------ &quot;ASS&quot; (Astoria Sandwich Society) has flourished on all the cool places to get a sandwich around here. :)

				I find the smell of McDonalds much more disgusting.&nbsp; At least with Subway, it&#39;s only the smell of bread.&nbsp; McD&#39;s is rancid low quality fried beef.&nbsp; I love the smell of good cooked beef, but that ain&#39;t it.&nbsp; So I kinda hope some other place will take over McD&#39;s location when they renovate the fire damaged building.&nbsp; But yeah, a locally owned place would have certainly been preferable.<br /><br />All hale the corporate food machine!

				The Subway is going in the old Hershey&#39;s ice cream shop (which used to be Baskin Robbins before that), which closed up shortly before the chain one opened on the other side of the alley.&nbsp; (A great local choice for gelato and ices is La Guli, on Ditmars between 31st and 29th since the 1930s, I think.)&nbsp; The KFC is turning into a Cohen&#39;s Fashion Optical - not the one, if I recall, that got burned out in the fire this summer.<br /><br />I honestly can&#39;t remember if I&#39;ve ever eaten at a Subway, and I plan on keeping it that way.&nbsp; The Sandwich King of Astoria is just around the corner, on 23rd near 33rd, and Buon Appetit Deli is on Ditmars between 36th and 37th!

				ah yes, sorry I got the building wrong. Speaking of the new Cohen&#39;s, their big wood plank thing was halfway falling down when I walked past it tonight. I expect it to be fully fallen over by the morning, hopefully not on top of somebody. Some of Subway&#39;s food isn&#39;t that bad, especially as far as fast food chains are concerned, and the prices are good.. but you can get much better for a dollar or two more at various other places near just about any Subway in the city. And I don&#39;t trust the quality of the meat there. Not that it&#39;s spoiled, just poor quality. I swear the grilled chicken&#39;s black stripes are painted on.<br /><br />Disappointing about both places... is another store going to go where the old Cohen&#39;s was? I didn&#39;t really expect better given a lot of the other kinds of places that have been opening (Planet Wings, The UPS Store, the Sprint store that hired that poor man to stand out on the sidewalk all day trying to give people ads, Coldstone Creamery). Is Thirty One ever going to re-open? I saw into the place a month or so ago and it still looked terrible.

				Hi Annie,<br /><br />The humorously anacronymized Astorian Sandwich Society does in fact still meet @ the Freezepeach cafe on Tuesdays at 1:30 in the p.m. (according to Jayme whom you can contact via the board) when they order out or send some poor soul to pick up the called for morsels.<br /><br />Being a long standing and proud member of this illustrious organization i have neverthless not been able to attend for quite a long time since I usually completely run out of cash by Tuesdays... yes, not even enough to afford a sandwich!<br /><br />You can glean more information <span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size">Here</span> (http://astorians.com/index.php?topic=306.0).<br />Welcome to A.S.S.!

				Thanks for the details! I&#39;m already planning to hit up both sandwich locations ASAP, hopefully this weekend!! I only wish the weather were warmer so I could ride my bike up there... pish-posh, sandwiches call. Any more reccommendations? My favorite sandwiches are sadly the ones I make myself on my DeLonghi panini press (yes its pretentious but I got it as a wedding gift). The proscuitto and fresh mozzarella balls from Gary at D&amp;F Deli on Broadway are the mainstays. I also like to add asparagus, arugula, tapenade, and a myriad of other sandwich goodies. I&#39;m still working on Club Sandwich East Coast chapter: people get together monthly/weekly at someone&#39;s flat and assemble their own sandwiches or discuss sandwiches or plan new sandwiches to make...<br /><br /><br />Also, the British are naturally sandwich-obsessed. They have their own association:<br />http://www.sandwich.org.uk/ <br />

				Hey neighbor! Im on your other side at NBC. <br />I hear ya about the dreaded concourse, i don&#39;t step foot down there unless its after regular hours but then your selections are minimal anyways, so yeah-not worth it. <br />I know of the falafel dude you&#39;re talking about, i coulda sworn he was further down but i&#39;ll have to ask my boss. But even in that little middle of the block area in the diamond district-the cross thru place- i think the kosher place there is supposed to rock too. I&#39;m down for lunch next week. It will give me a few days to run recon! i&#39;m telling you, i bring my lunch or venture to the dreaded commisary if need be, but rarely do i try to deal with the mass of tourists out there.

				Are you sure the falafel place isn&#39;t Moshe&#39;s Falafel on 46th near 6th?&nbsp; I believe it&#39;s kosher.&nbsp; Very tasty.&nbsp; A nice, big, messy sandwich - good and spicy if you like it - for $3.75.&nbsp; Love the skinny pickles, too!<br /><br />

				From what I hear the owner of the buldings with all the stores from Key Food to where the old hershey store used to be is being picky about renewing leases. He is only doing shirt term leases. As soon as Key food/s lease is up they are getting rid of Key food and all the other places there. We new key food was going months before it did becouse my husband was trying to get other stores in its place there.

				Too bad they can&#39;t stick a Whole Foods in place of Met. <br /><br />Anybody see the new Whole Foods locations in NYC? Holy freakin&#39; food heaven. Except for the lines out the door. I just might start taking the train into the city just for Whole Foods.<br /><br />I like Subway for their veggie-wheat-bread sandwiches (basically overpriced salad on wheat bread, but I&#39;m weak.) Also their oatmeal-raisin cookies are to die for. <br /><br />Almost got tuna salad there the other day (location on B&#39;way/21st) but it looked more like hummus- a leeeetle too much mayo for my taste!!<br /><br />Oh, and the Associated supermarket in that location is pretty cheap- 99 cents for a box of hot chocolate on sale (usually $1.50), same box is $2.19 @ Key Food.

				I wouldn&#39;t exactly consider Freeze Peach hipster central, as most of the people I know who frequent the place work for a living, including myself.&nbsp; And it&#39;s no more expensive than Starbucks, with a much more relaxed and comfortable vibe.&nbsp; Not to mention better selection of teas and stuff.&nbsp; It&#39;s a nice community if I may say so myself.&nbsp; And I totally agree that better Subway than McDonalds.&nbsp; I&#39;ve been know to get a sandwich at Subway from time to time in a pinch.

				I&#39;m sure JoeSteel is just trolling, but at any rate, I think we&#39;re all well aware and fairly accepting that Ditmars &amp; 31st St isn&#39;t exactly Mom &amp; Pop Shop central. Considering that Subway is replacing a Hershey&#39;s, which is right across from a Starbucks and around the corner from Dunkin Donuts, down the street from Blockbuster, and next to a Coldstone Creamery, it isn&#39;t really all that big a deal that we&#39;re getting another chain. I just hate the smell of the place and find the food rather low-grade (not compared to McDonald&#39;s, but compared to most places that sell sandwiches). As for cheap, it&#39;s pretty easy to get cheap food around there. SoHo does have good salads - you can get one that&#39;s chock full of goodness for around $6. The spinach salad at Igloo is wonderful also.

				My suspicions about my aversion to the aroma of Subway bread have to do with the fact that I lived across the street from one, and passed by every day.&nbsp; I used to eat there sporadically, but one day something just snapped and the bread began to smell awful to me.&nbsp; Sometimes I would feel nauseated from the smell.&nbsp; So, I have a bad association with the place.<br /><br />I will say, I think Subway smells differently in California compared to NY.&nbsp; Perhaps it&#39;s the aromas in the air around the Subway mixing with the bread that make it smell so putrid to me.&nbsp; I also find the smell of the pretzel vendor carts in Manhattan to be pretty awful, too.&nbsp; They smell rancid to me, similar to Subway, actually.&nbsp; Perhaps there is something in common, I don&#39;t know.<br /><br />For me, it&#39;s hard to get past something if it smells awful.&nbsp; Except some cheeses.<br /><br />

				megc, I grew up on L.I. But as a single grown-up, I&#39;m totally nuts for this neighborhood. <br /><br />Kings Park was where I lived before here, and I noticed (while driving out there last weekend) that there&#39;s a Dairy Barn directly across the street from my old apartment- and it&#39;s a small sidestreet!<br /><br />When I first walked around Ditmars/31st, my first impression was that it was like a bazaar. A blur of storefronts, harried crowded sidewalk, noisy train, stinky alley, and a homeless camp. <br /><br />As I got into a routine, I learned the stores one by one, the cast of characters and the general rythym or it all. The charm gradually unfolded and now I&#39;m pleased that I can see it underneath the chaos. <br /><br />On L.I., where people team up and isolate themselves as family units, it&#39;s like a Mad Max movie trying to do errands in the car. Around here, you walk around more and get to know folks at a more intimate level. Ironically, it&#39;s got more in common with small-town America than the former farm villages out east, I think.<br /><br />

				Hey Christine, I know where you&#39;re coming from! :-)&nbsp; &nbsp;When I lived on LI I lived on Route 25A, across from a bunch of businesses, and of course right on a super busy highway.&nbsp; I saw a lot of crazy driving while I lived there.&nbsp; I also lived on LI without a car, which was quite a feat at times.&nbsp; I will admit that it is quite pretty and very green where I lived in Stony Brook, but there were more things that frustrated me about living out there, which counteract the bucolic nature of the place.<br /><br />When I moved to Astoria, I also found the area around the Ditmars station to be a flurry of activity and bit disorienting.&nbsp; But yes, over time I was able to make sense of it and find order in the chaos.&nbsp; I love the area and have developed a real fondness for my new neighborhood.&nbsp; I&#39;m certainly way healthier here than I was on LI.&nbsp; I&#39;ve met such terrific people in Astoria!&nbsp; And made some good friends.&nbsp; I love it here!<br /><br />

				I happen to love Soho.&nbsp; They have a big variety of things to order and they have a lot of healthy selections along with good burgers and fries.&nbsp; The price of breakfast is reasonable and the home fried potatoes are delicious and not greasy and I love the honey whole wheat pancakes.&nbsp; And yes they do serve bacon and also turkey bacon.

Freeze peach has a nice atmosphere where you feel welcomed as soon as you walk in. They have a lot of community type groups that meet there every week because it is not a cliche cafe. (Crafty group called ACK, a Tecnological brunch group and many more) I can even go as far to say that you can not find a cafe simular to the peach anywhere. It is different from any other cafe in New York City. It is because the cafe is so different from any other place that people enjoy going to this cafe. <br /><br />Second of all, you must have never actually been in the freeze peach. They do not searve food there. Only drinks, and compared to starbuck the drinks are not only better tasting and better for you but also a lot cheaper for the quality you get. If anyone is inside there eating a Tofu-Hummus-Alf-Alfa-Whole-Wheat sandwich then it is because they bought it elsewhere and brought it in. Since the peach does not sell food they let people bring in there own food as long as they take thier own trash from the food out with them.
