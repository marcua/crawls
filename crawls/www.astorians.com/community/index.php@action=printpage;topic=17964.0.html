				Has anybody noticed that the El Rey del Taco truck has been missing this past week?&nbsp; Unless I&#039;ve missed something, they haven&#039;t been parked in their usual spot outside the Rite Aid at night.<br /><br />I certainly hope they&#039;re on vacation.

				Hi guys-<br /><br />I wanted to bump this topic in case anybody had any new information.&nbsp; Does anybody remember them mentioning a hiatus or a vacation?<br /><br />I really hope it&#039;s just a permit renewal thing - that taco truck is a neighborhood mainstay, and I would hate to see it go.

				I&#039;m on the lookout for the truck too! I remember a few years ago they were gone for almost two weeks; turns out they took a family trip to Mexico. I&#039;m hoping they&#039;ll be back rapido...I need my tosada fix.

				El Rey is my favorite truck.&nbsp; There is another one on Broadway at 36th Streets sometimes, which is also good, though not as good as El Rey.

				I was going to ask also last week but I got busy.&nbsp; &nbsp; I tried calling the number on the menu and it went to voicemail, so at least it&#039;s not disconnected.

				I saw a post on Why Leave Astoria that said the truck was going in for repairs.&nbsp; But a month and a half is a pretty long time to fix a food truck.

				This is the blog posting you were referring to:&nbsp; http://www.whyleaveastoria.com/profiles/blogs/taco-truck-alternatives<br /><br />It was written by my friend Brad who is a food blogger. It is dated April 24th. That truck has been gone a loooong time. :(

				Talk about minds running in the same channels--I just visited this site earlier today looking for a thread on this, and if I hadn&#039;t found this thread I would have started one on the same subject.<br /><br />Where is it, indeed?
