			I have had the fortune of working as a volunteer and employee at Sunnyside Community Services for the past 2 years. We are currently in search of volunteers who speak another language, especially Greek. We also usually have a high need for male volunteers, as we try to pair older men with male volunteers. <br /><br />The program is one that is close to my heart, as I first learned of Sunnyside Community Services through this program. The commitment is only for one hour per week. I can personally speak to the good it does in the lives of seniors to have someone who visits them consistently. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />If you would like to learn more, you can visit us online here [https://www.scsny.org/programs/senior-programs/friendly-visiting-pet-pals][/size], email me, or call me at 929.335.7800. Thanks.
