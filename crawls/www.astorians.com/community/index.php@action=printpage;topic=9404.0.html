				Didn&#039;t like the 1st episode, but LOVED last night&#039;s. SPOILER ALERT-GO AWAY!<br /><br />I loved the latest group of nerdy scientists coming onto the island and how ironic that the only person who knew how to handle the group and get Ben was killed before any of them...and she was there to protect them. HHAAA! <br /><br />I&#039;m just concerned that there are going to be only 6 more. NO!!!!! I&#039;m hoping the writers for this show are so crazy about it, that they&#039;re still writing for it. Is that wishful thinking or what?!&nbsp; :roll:

				I am intrigued by the new people as well but right now I feel like there are so many differant story lines going on - that I am having a hard time keeping them all straight. Good thing they keep showing the recap programs- because honestly I would not have remembered half of what happened last season- I am lucky if I can remember what I ate for breakfast yesterday!&nbsp; &nbsp;:-P<br /><br />I can&#039;t believe there are only six shows left in this season. I really hope the writers can come to some sort of agreement as well and write at least a few more episodes. I hate the thought of having to wait another six months to a year to get some more answers. <br /><br />I am really bummed about Charlie. I really liked him. I am dying th know who rounds out the Oceanic 6!!

				Alright MasterJ, if you&#039;re a real Lost connection, you keep that news coming! GOD Bless you. Each and everyone of&nbsp; you.<br /><br />I was very upset about Charlie, too, even tears, and I&#039;m pretty thick-skinned when it comes to having my tears manipulated by tv shows. I don&#039;t know, mabye it was time of the month and I like how Charlie sings&nbsp; :-D (I&#039;m also a Trilogy fan,) ....and I watched this episode 2x. <br /><br />So, so far, we know of the six: Kate, Jack, Hurley. Next week, we fine out one more. I&#039;m still trying to figure out whose funeral Jack went to. I still think it&#039;s Sawyer or maybe Locke??? She had to care but not care, so who!?<br /><br />By the way, for some fantastic theorizing, check out Lost-Forum.com (worth registering), some uber-lost smart people watching and recording these episodes and plot rehashing and analyzing all this out. GREAT reading.

Jack was going to kill Locke; to me, that was the surprise! And we&#039;ve seen Locke from the very beginning try to foster these more aggresive, hunter/survivor type instincts in himself since he got on the island. I think Locke, in his own way, a more intuitive way, is on a mission. I don&#039;t even think he knows what that is, but clearly he has some sort of symbiosis with the island: his unparalysis, his healing wound, his ability to read the weather, seeing the man in the cabin, etc.... It looks like the Island is starting to favor him over Ben. I think that both Ben and Jack are headed in the same direction but just taking different paths.

				big fan of this show but its starting to get on my nerves.<br />First episode was so-so. <br />One think about the writers they know how to fill an hour without giving us one answer only more questions. for example last season we heard that they are coming to pick them up its been 2 shows and the ship is no where to be found.<br />Adding all this new people and twists to assure another 2-3 seasons will get to be tiring IMO (i hope i am wrong).

				I love Locke, and I like this almost final split between Jack and Locke.&nbsp; But if someone is getting desperate I also think its Jack.&nbsp; I think Locke was surprised and disappointed when Jack would have shot him (Its not loaded).&nbsp; I&#039;m looking forward to seeing Locke start a new band of island natives, I think he&#039;s supposed to be the new leader for the island that Ben was supposed to be but wasn&#039;t.<br /><br />And the Not Penny&#039;s Boat folks... just a guess but I think they&#039;re Dharma trying to get back to the Island since Ben led the purge.<br /><br />Also I read on lostpedia (another great lost site) that the producers said at ComicCon that Mikhail (&#039;Ol Patchy) was killed when he blew up the Looking Glass and killed Charlie.&nbsp; I hope not, I love that guy, and they&#039;ve &quot;killed&quot; him before and he&#039;s come back.&nbsp; By the way, MikHail Bakunin (the characters name) was a Communist philosopher, so you can add him to the list of characters named after philosophers.

				What&#039;s the deal with &quot;Jacob&quot; or whatever that endity is in the haunted looking house ? Whassup with Jack going back there ? What&#039;s the deal with these new characters from the boat , and why are they always adding new characters when wer&#039;e confused&nbsp; enough with the ones already there ?<br />Always more questions than answers... I love it.<br /><br />PS Even if the writer&#039;s strike ends today as rumoured - to write shoot and edit episodes won&#039;t happen in time for this season - unless they want to do a special summer series on it.<br /><br />PSS I&#039;d take Hawaii even in the rainforests - oh boo hoo

				I am a LOST fanatic.&nbsp; I can&#039;t believe that there&#039;s only six episodes left this season, but good to hear that they&#039;re going to start filming back up again soon.&nbsp; Maybe this will mean an earlier start to next season.&nbsp; I believe that LOST is only doing 16 episodes per season whereas most shows do around 24 so theoretically after these 8 episodes air, perhaps they can take a few months off, air the next eight episodes, then then a few more months off and start up the next season.&nbsp; If I&#039;m not mistaken, didn&#039;t the creator say that the show was only going to go on for five seasons?&nbsp; If that&#039;s the case, then next season will be the last one.&nbsp; Hard to believe that it will be possible to answer all of the questions questions and mysteries that have popped up over the course of the show.

				I loved this week&#039;s episode.<br /><br />I&#039;m guessing that the people Ben is getting Sayid to kill are part of the Dharma Initiative, sort of trying to kill them before they can perhaps kill the other survivors left on the island, hence why Sayid feels he must help.&nbsp; I totally didn&#039;t expect Sayid to shoot that guy on the golf course, or for that German girl to shoot him later on.<br /><br />So far, this has been a great season.<br /><br />

				Well there are two islands, they showed them in the episode where Sawyer and Kate escaped in season 3.&nbsp; Not in some space/time continuum but in reality though.&nbsp; And I&#039;m under the impression that the other Flight 815 is a fake plane planted as a dummy.&nbsp; The new pilot character (whose name I forget) said that the dead pilot in the 815 crash can&#039;t be him cause he wasn&#039;t wearing his wedding ring, which I took to mean its not the actual Flight 815.<br /><br />And I also think the guys on the boat are from the original Dharma Initiative or the Hanso Corp.<br /><br />Also, I did a little internet searching cause Fisher Steven&#039;s name is in the credits.&nbsp; He&#039;s the voice of Minkowski, the guy on the boat who first spoke with Jack and Kate on the phone and seems to be the man in charge on the boat.&nbsp; Maybe he&#039;s Ben&#039;s mole.

				I think there&#039;s definitely something to the whole time difference. There is at minimum a 50 minute difference as we just found out, but maybe there&#039;s a bigger time loop caused by Desmond&#039;s hatch switch way back when. After the switch, we see him see his future-as an alternate version of his life. Also, in one time line, Charlie doesn&#039;t know how to swim, in another time line (after the switch) Charlie is a championship swimmer who has now made the distress call. <br /><br />On a side note, I&#039;m really curious how the writers are going to explain all the islander&#039;s relationships with their parents. They all are very untidy, either emotional orphans or strained relationships, etc... with one or both parents. I wonder if this is another tie that brings them all together in an emotional sense or if this is simply a nice little poetic coincidence for the story.

				Yeah, I must have missed the half sister thing.&nbsp; And I didn&#039;t realize that she said Aaron, I thought it was Erik, but couldn&#039;t figure it out.&nbsp; I thought it was Sawyer&#039;s baby because the kid had blonde hair like his, and that made sense why Jack would not want to see the baby, as it would be a constant reminder of her being with Sawyer.&nbsp; And then I assumed Sawyer was dead now.<br /><br />So I guess I&#039;m all off now, because the name she said was Aaron.&nbsp; &nbsp;This show is so confusing!!!

Most likely, Jack, Kate, Sayid and the rest of the Oceanic 6 have some sort of vested interest in keeping this fact secret from the rest of the world as there seems to be a lot of people who for whatever reason have an interest on those on the island (i.e. Mr. Abaddon, the faux-Oceanic lawyer who visited Hurley in the hospital, and also most likely whomever is on Ben&#039;s list of people for Sayid to kill).

				I think Michael is Ben&#039;s spy on the boat.&nbsp; <br /><br />The past two episodes have been really good, but the previous week&#039;s episode with the time traveling left me with a headache.&nbsp; It was just too much for me to wrap my head around.&nbsp; I&#039;m really liking Faraday as a character and think the actor who plays him does a good job at adding idiosyncracies that come across as very genuine (i.e. he ACTS very well) but man, Charlotte is way more Lara Croft than I realized.&nbsp; I admit that as cliched and predictable as it may have seemed, I got choked up at Desmond and Penny&#039;s phone call.<br /><br />I do not trust Juliette at all.&nbsp;

				Was I the only one who thought the revenge thing with Ben was the last straw of things getting a little hokey and annoying?&nbsp; We finally see Whitmore again, and it opens yet another can of worms?&nbsp; How about telling me why he thinks it&#039;s his island in the first place?&nbsp; How about answering some friggin questions?&nbsp; And we lost 3 good characters in one shot!!&nbsp; That&#039;s a bit much for this girl to take!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;:x&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m WAY too addicted to this show.&nbsp; I want answers, dammit.

				I love this series so much. I&#039;m nervous reading this thread&nbsp; though (had to skip a bunch of posts to avoid spoilers) because I haven&#039;t watched the episode that aired 2 weeks ago an I&#039;m waiting till tomorrow night when my girlfriend is around and they are playing the extended version. <br /><br />I totally called Ben and the smoke monster though and that made me feel like a winner.

				Looking forward to watching this season finale tomorrow since I&#039;m at work until 830 and I would miss the beginning. That is unless one of you lost fans has a DVR and room on your couch for a handsome gentleman and a six pack of beer.<br /><br />Come to think of it I will have to avoid this thread entirely until I watch the episode or risk spoilers (like anything is ever answered in Lost anyway).

				I loved that crank to move the island and all the fire bursting from the cracks. Ben better come back in the next two years. What is up with this show-2 years to get us off the island and now 2 years to get us back?!!!&nbsp; :-o All I gotta say is it better be worth it besides &quot;this island is special&quot; and &quot;it must be protected.&quot;

				Ok, so that was so over the top, even for Lost. But I love the island moving wheel which looks like something out of an Indiana Jones movie! They need to go back to finish up what they started when their plane &quot;crash&quot; landed on it. It&#039;s complicated (duh it&#039;s lost- everything is complicated) but it has to do with The Others, Charles Whidmore, John Locke, Ben, and who will ultimately control the island, where it will end up ( or should I say when it will end up). Ok I said too much already.

				I think it&#039;s more like a cake that you were all excited to eat, but then you put it in your mouth, and it tastes slightly off, and you realize some ingredients were missing. And you&#039;re really bummed because you were really excited about that cake. But somebody left the cake out in the rain...and it too so long to bake it...and I&#039;ll never have that recipe again...<br /><br />***SPOILERS AHEAD*****<br />but seriously i&#039;m disappointed. The episode before last was building up to something awesome (the Ben and Hurley candybar episode) and this just feels like they kitchen sinked a bunch of crap for next time. <br /><br />I did enjoy it, though. It was fun guessing what was going to happen to the ones outside the &quot;oceanic 6.&quot; Was nice to know that things worked out for Desmond and Penny. But I wanted to know if Penny knows what her dad is up to. Why her dad hates Desmond.&nbsp; <br /><br />Problems: <br />1. The reason for them lying is stupid. The plane at the bottom of the ocean story is already out and accepted. If it is now shown that there were survivors, aren&#039;t the survivors now going to be targeted by Widmore and his gang? I&#039;d think now that the island has been moved, the ones left on the island are now pretty safe too. <br />2. What has Locke done that is so horrible that they all hate him? <br />3. Why would it have been so important for Jack to remain on the Island? Obviously the island has plans for Locke, and Ben (hd), but I never got the impression the island cared one whit for Jack. Unless it&#039;s woven into this whole Claire thing. Tht&#039;s really confusing. <br />4. Why would Kate be like, &quot;i have to explain to (Aaron) every day why you&#039;re not here). It&#039;s not like Jack is his biological father! And she&#039;s not even his mother! Just seemed kinda weird.<br />5. Why didn&#039;t Desmond yell at all the deck hands to get off the boat? When he came running up top, there was a poor dude swabbing the deck - shouldn&#039;t he at least have said, &quot;if I were you I&#039;d get the hell off the boat!&quot; <br /><br />I do however liked how they repeated a flash forward, and how now we know how Ben ended up in the desert with that parka on. Ben has really grown on me the last few episodes.

				I&#039;m waiting for a guest star appearance by theoretical physicist Dr. Michio Kaku explaining everything in one neat package, which of course no one will really fully understand. Perhaps he could be in one of the Dharma Initiative films which are so good at explaining everything else.<br /><br />I have to say when they talked of Moving the Island, I had not thought of moving it in the 4th dimension. In retrospect, it should have looked obvious.<br />Wonder if there will be time shift repercussions &quot; a la &quot; the&nbsp; &nbsp;Philadelphia Experiment and other issues.

While initially I would have agreed about the lying being a stupid idea, after seeing the episode last night, and seeing how the 6 are being &quot; watched&quot;, most surely by Whidmore, I don&#039;t think it makes much of a difference either way that they lied. Plus I think that they lied to protect the island and the others, and also the whole world thought that they were dead. Whidmore is sort of like a Rupert Murdoch/Donald Trump sort of person who can get anything he wants to be done his way, and nobody will ask questions.<br />&nbsp;Did Ben actually &quot;die&quot;?
