				UPDATE: ALL ITEMS NOW SOLD<br /><br />Hi everyone,<br /><br />We&#039;re starting to go through all our stuff because we have to move soon. So I&#039;ll be posting things to this thread that we&#039;re getting rid of. You&#039;ll need to be able to pick up the items at my apartment near Ditmars and 31st Street (PM for exact address).<br /><br />I&#039;ll just keep posting items to this same thread with pictures. If you want something just send me a Private Message (http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?action=pm).

				The first items are brand new, unused cooking sets. These are great for a gift for someone, or if you don&#039;t have some of the items in the kits.<br /><br />WOK 101 (http://www.amazon.com/KitchenPrep-101-Pc-Tabletops-Unlimited/dp/B000HYK9BY) - This is a WOK set, see the link for more details. Have one of these.<br /><br />Panini 101 (http://www.amazon.com/Cast-Iron-Panini-Pan-Press/dp/B000HYLXDC) - A set to make panini sandwiches. See link for details. I have two of these kits.<br /><br />French Fries 101 - A set to make your own french fries. <br /><br />All these come in their original unopened box - never used. I got them to give as gifts but didn&#039;t end up giving them away. The sets come with everything pictured in the picture.<br /><br />Paid $20 each for them, I&#039;m selling for $5 each.<br /><br />PICTURES (http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/K4alawNAUEQ6pZBZXC5ykw)

				Selling Takamine ES45C Jasmine acoustic electric guitar (http://www.americanmusical.com/Item--i-TAK-JASES45C-LIST?SRC=D0407FG0HAMS0000&amp;utm_source=froogle&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;) for $50. Comes with a guitar stand. <br /><br />Got this brand new a few years ago, but never have learned to play it. It&#039;s in good condition, but strings will likely need to be replaced.

				Next up for sale is a Holmes floor heater (http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/OQ_sQLv8tbvOVmEcGTsvNA). It was $25 last winter, now $5. Works great as a back up when your building heat goes out. :)<br /><br />

				All books are tentatively taken, and guitar is tentatively taken as well. Otherwise I believe we still have the other items available. Merm will need to confirm, however. :)

				Guitar w/ guitar stand, 1 panini set, wok set, floor heater have all found new homes. (<strong>Thank you</strong> to everyone who&#039;s taken these items!!)<br /><br />Most books have been taken, but I still have quite a few left if anyone wants to browse. I may take some time this weekend to post a new list of what&#039;s left.<br /><br />

				I have a few more items up for sale:<br /><br />This is a simple black desk with one cubby on the right hand side. It&#039;s 16&quot; deep, by 42&quot; wide. It&#039;s in good shape. $10<br />[img width= height=]http://lh3.ggpht.com/_sByQHeON1Ys/SVGK5UOoxtI/AAAAAAAAAWM/vHvEh-HJeQc/s288/IMG_1340.JPG[/img] (http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/E1JAvxFP-seNtEUQiZ1RXA?feat=embedwebsite)<br /><br />Next I have a night stand with two drawers. It&#039;s black and is in good shape (the picture makes it look like it&#039;s scratched but it&#039;s actually not - I think it is just dusty and the flash makes it look more beat up than it is). It&#039;s 18&quot; wide by 16&quot; deep. $10<br />[img width= height=]http://lh5.ggpht.com/_sByQHeON1Ys/SVGK5j2NC0I/AAAAAAAAAWU/CpsRxgrxQfk/s288/IMG_1341.JPG[/img] (http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/NOhUdRXpgJPxdiInRnBflA?feat=embedwebsite)<br /><br />Last, a dresser. This one is old, and it&#039;s a little beat up. It&#039;s solid wood though and has been painted. Got it for free, and will give it away for free as well. $FREE<br />[img width= height=]http://lh4.ggpht.com/_sByQHeON1Ys/SVGK6erZz-I/AAAAAAAAAWc/NmEUR4mSJQc/s400/IMG_1342.JPG[/img] (http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/AVl_VRIbbxtidRUGyIFQbg?feat=embedwebsite)<br /><br />I also have a Queen size bed that&#039;s in excellent condition. This was in our guest room, and has been lightly used for a couple years by guests that have stayed with us. It has a queen mattress, box spring, and metal frame included. The mattress is firm and the springs are in good shape. BOTH the box spring and mattress have been encased in vinyl protectors for their whole life. There&#039;s also a memory foam topper you can have, and mattress cover as well if you want. We&#039;ve never had bed bugs or anything like that so you don&#039;t have to worry, and we don&#039;t smoke. I&#039;d like to sell the whole thing for $60.<br /><br />You must pick up any of this from my apartment. Send me a PM for more details or to pick anything up.

				I have a 13&quot; TV as well for $20. It has RCA inputs so you can hook it directly up to a DVD player, and also the regular coax hookup for cable or an antenna. Comes with a remote control as well.<br /><br />[img width= height=]http://lh4.ggpht.com/_sByQHeON1Ys/SVaCCvYHAgI/AAAAAAAAAa8/Z_OGnWAZFbw/s144/IMG_1344.JPG[/img]<br /><br />
