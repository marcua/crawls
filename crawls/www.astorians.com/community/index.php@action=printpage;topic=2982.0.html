				I&#39;ve been looking for a while for a real Pilates studio--not just the mat classes. Haven&#39;t found anything and would be grateful if anyone knew about one. <br /><br />thanks, <br />hillary

				The Astoria NYSC has a pilates class with machines... but I&#39;d imagine that you have to be a member to take those classes, and they&#39;re extra for members anyway. The only pilates I&#39;ve done in Astoria is the mat classes at the Yoga Room.

				Can I jump on this thread and ask for reccommendations on pilates mat classes in general? There&#39;s a place at Broadway and Steinway I&#39;ve been meaning to try but I&#39;d be curious to hear about any other great places in the area...

				thanks for the info on the gym. I keep hoping some instructor will have a Cadillac or Reformer in their apt in Astoria and give lessons, but that is yet to happen. <br /><br />

				Hi There,<br /><br />I am a certified pilates instructor.&nbsp; I have extensive experience and training in injury prevention, pre and post natal pilates, myofascial release, as well as yoga and strength/circuit training.&nbsp; I&#039;ve worked at several studios around the city. I&#039;ve recently had a baby and decided to shift all of my work to Astoria, since I live in the neighborhood.&nbsp; I teach privates sessions on the equipment in a space that&#039;s near the Broadway stop on the N/Q or the Steinway Stop on the R train.&nbsp; If you are interested in private sessions, I&#039;d love to speak with you and give you more information.<br /><br />Warmly,<br /><br />Josie Bray
