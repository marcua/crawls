I&#039;m sure International Meats on 30th wouldn&#039;t, anyway. Much of their business is wholesale to restaurants, and faking organic would destroy their reputation, and they&#039;d probably go under.<br />

				I was just stating my opinion that no food is safe anymore. Wherever it comes from, produce or meat, fish or fowl . . . nothing! I truly believe that this imported Chinese grain that has tainted the pet food industry is the beginning of what just might be the largest international food investigation of product ingredients in world history. <br /><br />[OT]<br />Personal Short Story:<br />In 1979 one of my children developed flu-like symptoms. As an intractible asthmatic he was quickly treated with a broad-spectrum antibiotic. After 5 doses he ended up being hospitalized. Intubated and in the PICU, nothing seemed to alleviate his breathing and he was dependent on the machine to breathe for him. I was scared to death that I was going to lose him at 9 years old. It took 8 days to discover that the reason the antibiotics weren&#039;t working was because he was immune to their effect because of the antibiotics used in producing meat and poultry. The second, concurrent, problem was the nitrites used in keeping green produce green. He is currently 37 years old and has to carry an EpiPen to inject himself if he somehow ingests nitrites, or for that matter nitrates, as he instantly has an anaphylactic reaction.<br />[/OT]<br /><br />Neither the FDA nor other agencies responsible for our food supply can be certain that our food is safe until offending products are removed from the food supply and not allowed for sale in the country.

				I&quot;m concerned with the food regarding pregnancy and child development. What we are putting in our bodies may be affecting our children and prenatal development. This the field that I am in (special education and autism) and it is concerning. <br /><br />The vegan lifestyle for pregnant women is not advisable without significant dietary supplements to get the nutrients that a child needs. But is it vegan or organic that is the concern? Tomato that have been raised to be tougher for transport aren&#039;t good in any diet. <br /><br />It is scary anyway you look at it.

It is disturbing to me, although I consume them myself as well, that tomatoes you buy in the grocery store were grown in Mexico. First off, what are Mexico&#039;s regulations for tomato growing and are they the same as U.S. regulations? Secondly, why is there such a demand for non-seasonal produce? Tomatoes are primarily a summer fruit for our region, yet you can buy them year-round which means more you have to ship them in from other parts of the country or other countries. You have two problems going on there - not only are they probably not organic, but you are also harming the environment with added emissions.<br /><br />The problem with organic, in my mind, is that it is becoming so popular that non-seasonal organic foods for our region are being shipped in from California (Earthbound salad greens for example) and overseas. While organic, it still harms the environment. For me the ideal would be local <em>and</em> organic <em>and</em> from smaller farms (not industrial or factory).<br /><br />As far as vegan - that&#039;s your personal choice. I think if you do consume meat, dairy, and egg products you are better off buying local and organic. It seems to me there is much less risk in buying from a local small family farm than to buy from a large factory farm where the production is so massive that it is hard to manage the quality of the product.

				The ruination of the tomato!<br /><br />This <del>might seem</del> is naive, but what exactly qualifies a veggie or meat to be organic?&nbsp; Does organic farming generally involve an increase or decrease in costs as well as production per acre?&nbsp; And what makes organic products healthier than non-organic.&nbsp; As an ignorant SOB, I hear the term thrown around as so much that I feel there is a gulf between what the deal really is and what the standard american consumer thinks it is.

For veggies, briefly, you can&#039;t use chemical fertilizers, pesticides, or herbicides. &quot;Natural&quot; fertilizers (manure) and pesticides (Bt) are fine. Meat is complicated, but I think it involves feeding mostly organic feed, and no prophylactic antibiotics or hormones. Note that certification is expensive, so most labeled organic is from medium-sized producers and larger. Small producers, such as those at farmers markets, often grow organically but are not &quot;Certified Organic.&quot;<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> Does organic farming generally involve an increase or decrease in costs as well as production per acre? <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Usually, but not always, organic farming costs more and has lower yields. Nitrogen fertilizer made from oil is really, really cheap. (Thank you Green Revolution.)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">And what makes organic products healthier than non-organic. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Usually nothing, except that some of the pesticides and herbicides have residues that may be harmful if ingested regularly. Oh, and organic produce has more bugs, which are high in protein. Personally, I think most of the benefits of organic are environmental more than medical, especially if you&#039;re careful to wash produce before eating it. <br /><br />And that&#039;s not even always the case. For example, with row crops like corn, you have to till the soil regularly to keep weeds down, resulting in more runoff of topsoil into rivers. That&#039;s not sustainable. With non-organic production, you can dump broad-spectrum herbicides that degrade harmlessly in 24 hours onto the soil, grow GMO corn that&#039;s resistant to the herbicide, and use no-till methods that don&#039;t waste topsoil. I think it&#039;s a toss-up which one is worse.<br /><br />Oh, and note that you literally can&#039;t grow organic apples in the Northeast. The bugs here are so nasty that you have to use insecticides if you want more than two apples per tree. <br /><br />
