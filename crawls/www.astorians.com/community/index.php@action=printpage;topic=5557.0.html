				The running joke is that they do not exist in Astoria.&nbsp; Try doing a search for Chinese food on this board.&nbsp; It&#039;s been discussed :)

				You may want to consider taking a short trip to Flushing (Northern Blvd., Main St., Union St. area.) <br /><br />I was impressed with takeout from Luck Joy on Main, and they&#039;ve got awesome dumplings at White Bear (hole-in-the-wall, no menu, off the beaten path) my co-workers tell me.

				I have replied to this question before and I still stand by my answer to this day! The New Ho Wah Chinese Restaurant on Broadway and 42nd street (718-956-1849) IMHO has the best Chinese we have found in Astoria. Not only is the food great, but the service is great and the delivery guy is always very nice and prompt. I still do not like baby corn though, :-P.

				White Bear is amazing - and you can buy bags of the dumplings to go!

				It&#039;s obviously way out of Astoria and Queens, but I try to go to Joe&#039;s Shanghai Dumpling House at 9 Pell Street, at least once a month!&nbsp; Their soup dumplings are yummy and really freaking cheap.&nbsp; It&#039;s communal dining and the lines can get pretty long, but it&#039;s well worth the tight spaces and wait!<br /><br />http://www.joeshanghairestaurants.com/

				They have good soup dumplings, but you can find better in Chinatown, less crowded too.&nbsp; I wish we had a place that had soup dumplings in Astoria!

				I&#039;m done with White Bear:<br /><br />Couple of weeks ago, went with a co-worker and they screwed up the order. Partly due to there being two different menus posted up.<br /><br />Went on Saturday for some veggie dumplings, they were all out. Ditto for frozen.&nbsp; :-P<br /><br />Went their today to graciously pick some up for my co-workers, &quot;no more dumplings.&quot;&nbsp; :? Then I turn around to find I was getting a ticket for double-parking!!&nbsp; :x I was there for all of 30 seconds, it&#039;s like the cop just materialized out of nowhere&nbsp; :cry:<br /><br />
