				It IS about friggin&#39; time!&nbsp; Ozzy toured with Sabbath, Bruce Dickinson came back to Maiden, even Axl has been in the news.&nbsp; It&#39;s a good time to be a metal fan, I guess.

I really do but it&#39;s so disappointing when the old rockers come out for a reunion tour or album. It&#39;s just not the same. Iv&#39;e seen a couple of groups performing whose shelf life was getting close to the expiration date. It was a littel sad to see these 40+ guys trying to strut and sing and play like 19 year olds again.<br /><br />Anyway, I hope Van Hallen Reborn is successful, or at least the guys have a lot of fun with it. I guess we&#39;ll see if Roth and Eddie Van Halen can work together again.<br /><br />Oh I have to say the rare exception to the aging rocker has got to be Bruce Springsteen. He&#39;s in his early 50s and his stage presence and enegy is incredible.
