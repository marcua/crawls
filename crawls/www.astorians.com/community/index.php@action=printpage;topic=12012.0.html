				In case you didn&#039;t see today, the Soleil coffee shop on Astoria Blvd. opened up again today.&nbsp; We stopped in, and everything was great!&nbsp; I&#039;m very excited about this, as I was pretty bummed when they closed a while back.

				Finally, Cafe Soleil is back!!&nbsp; They won&#039;t have the hours they used to have (until midnight), I think now it&#039;s only until 8pm or 9pm, but they were surely missed in the neighborhood!&nbsp; <br /><br />I think they will have wi-fi service back online in a week or so, too!&nbsp; Why waste your money on Starbucks when there is a better <span class="bbc_u">local</span> option!&nbsp; <br /><br />When so many local businesses have been forced to close this year, I have to congratulate Sami &amp; Aziz for fighting to save their coffeehouse (and ours!).&nbsp; <strong>Thank you guys!!</strong>

				I stopped in there last weekend.&nbsp; The space is really nice, very chill.&nbsp; Nice, quiet music that doesn&#039;t preclude reading.&nbsp; The location is unfortunate but perhaps word of mouth will help.&nbsp; The iced coffee I got was excellent, though the muffin had a weird spongy texture that I wasn&#039;t fond of (but may be exactly to someone else&#039;s taste).<br /><br />I&#039;m a bit suspicious of amys_web&#039;s posting because she has only two posts on this board and they&#039;re both ringing endorsements of Cafe Soleil, but I like the place and I&#039;m glad it&#039;s close to me.&nbsp; I&#039;d stopped in during its previous run but just ordered to-go, didn&#039;t check out the space that time.<br /><br />Might be a nice space for the occasional tip-jar-paid acoustic singer/songwriter, if the owners are into that sort of thing.&nbsp; I miss that from Chicago coffeehouses.

				I&#039;m another fan of Soleil. We used to have book club meetings there twice a month, and the staff was always friendly and the atmosphere is great. I hope their hours will be long enough to accomodate us again, but if not, I&#039;ll be back anyway.

				It&#039;s b/w 37th and 38th on Astoria Blvd.<br /><br />Soleil is great, I hope they get some good business this time around. I was just there for the first time - I think it&#039;s my favorite of the few Astoria coffeeshop options (and the closest for me!). The iced coffee was great, good service. I love their decor - the vibe is very welcoming and comfortable.<br /><br />They didn&#039;t have wifi yet, but hopefully they&#039;ll have it running soon. <br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;m continuing to like this place.&nbsp; I feel that it has a lot more of a &quot;coffeehouse&quot; vibe than it did before its hiatus.&nbsp; Too bad the view isn&#039;t better, but the coffee is good and they&#039;ve started selling meat and seafood &quot;pies&quot; (which I haven&#039;t tried yet).

				Hmmm, wasn&#039;t too impressed with Soleil the one time I went before it closed. It took me three tries to order because they were out of so many things and then my drink wasn&#039;t made right when I finally got it. Sounds like most people like it, though, so I guess I&#039;ll have to give it another shot!

				As of this past Saturday they were very much open.&nbsp; I tried the &quot;chicken pie,&quot; which I wouldn&#039;t exactly describe as a pie...I don&#039;t really know how I would describe it...sort of like a quiche in a knish...but not exactly...anyway, it was really good and very filling.&nbsp; Cinnamon-y.&nbsp; The seasoning was Middle Eastern-ish but otherwise it seemed like sort of an Eastern European-y kind of thing, very substantial...so be warned.&nbsp; I liked it.

				Its been love at first site for me here at Soleil and I wanted to pass on the location and recommendation to y&#039;all because its a wee bit out of the way in a place one might not necessarily go searching for a cute little coffee/food shop.&nbsp; <br /><br />Its tucked away on Astoria Blvd., I think between 37th and 38th Streets.&nbsp; They have a ton to offer, all made with love, its cheaper than any coffee shop I&#039;ve ever visited, and the staff is uber friendly.&nbsp; They offer hand made sandwiches (I had myself a their Bruschetta sandwich ($4) which comes with mozzarella, tomato, and home made pesto and they gave me the extra on the side), breakfast eats like bagels with your choice of topping, lots of baked goods, pastries, and breads, plus a nice assortment of coffees, teas, a large array of espresso, Iced coffees, and fresh made juices.&nbsp; I had myself a carrot apple and ginger juice which was served up in an enormous mug for about $3.&nbsp; They have soy options of those who like to avoid dairy, and a few vegetarian lite bites as well.&nbsp; <br /><br />The interior is very cute.&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty sure they just remodeled because the place closed down for a bit earlier this year and recently reopened.&nbsp; They offer free wi-fi as well, and couches and even an outdoor area to curl up in.&nbsp; I highly recommend it, its an oasis in the middle of Astoria Blvd. and a fantastic find.

				We went to Soleil twice this week.&nbsp; It makes me wish I have more reason to hang at a coffee shop.&nbsp; I love the space, the feel, the people who were working, the fact that they made my chai from scratch (with mortar and pestle), the music was good and at a reasonable volume - I want everyone to go there and love it!&nbsp; It&#039;s what a coffee cafe is &quot;supposed&quot; to be.&nbsp; (my take anyway)<br /><br />

				Business seems to be picking up a little bit--at least on weekends--but I kind of want to keep encouraging people to try this place because it&#039;s so off the beaten path.&nbsp; It&#039;s sort of the closest thing I&#039;ve found yet in NYC to my favorite (now closed) coffeehouse in Chicago.&nbsp; Not exactly the same, but as similar as I&#039;ve found.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure it&#039;s not going to be everyone&#039;s cup of tea (no pun intended), but some people will really take to it.&nbsp; Peaceful, relaxed, attractive space, low-key staff.<br /><br />If only they&#039;d book some tip-jar acoustic singer/songwriters, I could close my eyes and pretend I&#039;m still in the mid-1990s....<br />

				I went again to get some work done yesterday. I know someone had posted about them not being very accommodating to someone staying for a while and getting work done, but I found the opposite. The man behind the counter fell over himself to make sure I was comfortable, my computer was plugged in and that I liked my seat. I was there for about three hours and the place was packed with computer users. Maybe they&#039;ve realized that this is the crowd they will get? very nice place with friendly people.

The atmosphere of the place was exactly what we were looking for: warm, relaxed, casual.&nbsp; We liked that they had games, magazines and books scattered about and even played a couple of games of Othello.&nbsp; The place was full with people on laptops, reading and socialzing.&nbsp; It was neither dead quiet nor loud, a perfect din.&nbsp;

				This place is awesome!&nbsp; I went for the first time today.&nbsp; So many comfortable places to sit and the decor is really nice!&nbsp; There&#039;s a lot of fun treats and coffee available to order, and they bring it right to your table, you pay when you leave.&nbsp; They are really nice there, and the place was doing great business!&nbsp; It reminds me of what Waltz used to be, when it was more of a coffeehouse rather than performance club.&nbsp; I wish there were more places like Soleil closer to Ditmars, like Freezepeach was.&nbsp; It&#039;s a good walk for me to get there, but on a nice day, it&#039;s not so bad :)

				I love this place. the omelettes are great and the service is very friendly. plus there is a small outdoor area in back where you can eat.

				This is very sad news if it&#039;s true...although I did notice last time I went (about two weeks ago) the cafe seemed to have lost its joie de vivre.

				Oh man, I really hope this isn&#039;t true, I&#039;ve been real busy lately but I try and make it over there once a week or so.&nbsp; It&#039;s the kind of place that&#039;s hard to find in this area, I&#039;d hate to see them go.
