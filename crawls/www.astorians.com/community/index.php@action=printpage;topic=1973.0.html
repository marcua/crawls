				I went, but I don&#39;t know if I saw any of you nice astorians folks there.&nbsp; Although, I did get there near the end of the quiz because I got the avenue and street mixed up and ended up somewhere weird, but fortunately I reversed the address and, lo and behold, found my way to the Irish Rover.&nbsp; I stood in the corner like nerd through one and a half rum and Cokes before helping a very nice group of people (2 Irish, 1 Liverpudlian, and 2 Americans) with their quiz.&nbsp; Turns out I know the court case that ceased segregation, who played Atticus Finch in To Kill a Mockingbird, and Fox News&#39; slogan.&nbsp; Anyhoo, not that anybody asked, but I thought I&#39;d mention that I had a lovely time and thanks to MattM for getting me out of my apartment for a non-school reason.&nbsp; I still really look forward to meeting all of you astorians, though.&nbsp; Hopefully some very nice person will invite me to the next shindig.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-D

				If these are still going on end of May, I hope to make one of the weekend quizzes then.<br />...<br /><br />The questions sound tough.<br />Might have to study up on Mr. Peck and others.<br />He was in Cape Fear twice.<br /><br />What is the capital of hipistan?<br /><br />What kind of food is at the Irish Rover? Guinness?

				I love playing trivia, but I don&#39;t know if I can commit to a regular appearance on Sundays due to possible rehearsals popping up.&nbsp; And some Sundays I work at the cafe until 8pm. So don&#39;t necessarily count on me unless you&#39;re comfortable with this.&nbsp; But like I said, I will at least be there tonight to watch and support an astorians.com team!&nbsp; Anyway, it&#39;s totally up to youse guys.

				Well, that was fun! $10/team to play, winner takes the pot. One team (of seven playing) was myself, MegC, JustDesserts, and ImNotCrazy (I think that&#39;s the name here). Despite leading through most of the quiz, our shocking lack of sports knowledge killed us in the end, and we ended up in 3rd place, four points (out of a possible 70) out of 1st... It&#39;s a pretty good Irish pub, and the organizers (MattM and colleague) were friendly! There were a few other Astorians.com folks there, who I&#39;m interested to hear how much fun they had. :)<br />

				Astorians.com folk kicked ass! There were three associated teams there tonight. One, of DomNation and friends (non-A.com people?), and another of me, MegC, Anzubird, and DuluozCats, tied for 1st and split the pot of $100! A third team of Telesphoros and two friends of his did quite well too!&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;:mrgreen:

				It&#39;s sprained unfortunately. I tend to do that to myself often. Keep it elevated, and wrapped in an ace bandage. Ice packs help with the swelling. Staying off of it as much as possible will help. if you have to get around you may have to invest in crutches. You don&#39;t have to go to the doctor if it&#39;s sprained. and the wiggling of toes and light pressure without dying of pain is a good indication it&#39;s not broken. <br />i&#39;m on an 8 month no sprain streak...whoo hoo! knock wood i get another 8.<br />Jenn<br />who will eventually make it out to a quiz night, i really want to go!

				<strong>JustDesserts &amp; firelight79</strong>: When I was a little girl &quot;they&quot; said I had weak ankles. As I grew up I was living proof that you could sprain an ankle sitting still! I was plagued all my life . . . until an Emergency Room doctor suggested that I train my ankles to be stronger. He recommended a Wobble Board. I searched everywhere. (Remember this was long before the internet.) I finally found one on a business trip to Chicago. Once I started using it regularly, I *never* again walked off a curb and ended up with a sprained and swollen ankle.<br /><br />Mine looked very much like this:<br />(http://us.st11.yimg.com/us.st.yimg.com/I/net2fitness_1896_5281780)<br />It has a sorta round-ball on the bottom and you stand on it and balance. I was able to ski, ice-skate and jog after 6 months of use. Now, I have bilateral hip and knee replacements and consider myself lucky that I can still walk. <br /><br />If you are interested, you can search for an inexpensive one here (http://froogle.google.com/froogle?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;newwindow=1&amp;btnG=Search&amp;scoring=p&amp;q=Wobble+Balance+Board&amp;lmode=online&amp;cat=1706&amp;lnk=catsugg).<br /><br />Perhaps, if you 2 live near each other, you can share one. Morning for one, afternoon for the other.<br /><br />Remember, if you can wiggle your toes *without* screaming, nothing is broken. It you feel the need to scream, you *must* see a doctor for an x-ray.<br /><br />Wrap the ankle and arch tightly with an elastic bandage; place an ice pack on the swelling; keep the leg elevated above your buttocks—put a pillow on the coffee table or a chair so long as the height of the ankle is higher than your butt at sitting level—and put no pressure on the leg until the swelling goes down.<br /><br />Get well soon.

				I am enjoying the Rover more and more as I spend time there.&nbsp; Pub Quiz is fabulous and the beer is good, too.&nbsp; A nice atmosphere, too, with great music in the jukebox.&nbsp; I think it could be a very fun place for watching hot World Cup action.

				That was an uncommonly large amount of fun last night at ye olde pub quiz.&nbsp; How exhilarating to have won, although I can&#39;t actually take any credit, but I <em>was</em> able to put away 3 rum and Cokes.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Did anyone get right the question about the next stop after Bond Street on the London Underground&#39;s Central Line?&nbsp; I <em>knew</em> it was Oxford-bloomin&#39;-Circus. Why didn&#39;t I write that down!?!&nbsp; Didn&#39;t really hurt us though, did it?&nbsp; (Wink wink, nudge nudge)<br /><br />(Just for fun, here&#39;s a link to view the London Tube Map.&nbsp; Ah, London. . . )<br /><br />http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tfl/pdfdocs/colourmap.pdf<br /><br />Awesome to see Meg, as always, (you&#39;re such a sweetie and I promise I&#39;ll give you the book back next week; I totally forgot!) and Jonathan, you are a bodacious teammate, and all-around fun guy.&nbsp; You better come next week, too, and Jennifer!!!
