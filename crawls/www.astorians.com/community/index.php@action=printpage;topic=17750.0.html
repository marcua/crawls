				Out of curiosity, I just checked 2008 election results.<br /><br />The GOP didn&#039;t even bother running someone against Weiner. He got 112,000 votes and the Conservative Party candidate got 8,000. <br /><br />Maloney got 176,000 verses the GOPer who got 43,000.<br /><br />And yes, I will call Maloney tomorrow and thank her.

				It is the farthest thing from socialized medicine. There is no public option in the bill. There is no government insurance options. The government will not dictate any procedures you can and cannot receive. That is blatant misinformation. Please read the actual items in the bill and then form an opinion for yourself. This will actually foster competition between private industry as it gives them millions of new customers with no government option to compete with. It just puts regulations in place to protect the consumer such as not being able to be dropped from your insurance for a pre-existing condition, keeping your children on your plan until 26, not 21, etc. Tell me one factual instance in the bill that says the government is controlling procedures you can receive or what care you get besides insisting that you must have access to medical care. There is so much spin and misinformation going around, I think if people were educated about what was actually IN the bill rather than grasping at bullcrap spewed by pundits of both sides, they might think differently. But please realize, this is FAR from socialized medicine and please educate yourself on the facts. Regulating an industry is not the same as taking it over. But I&#039;m sure there&#039;s no talking to you as you&#039;re fully convinced of yourself and what you think that there will be no civilized discussion only panic and fear.

From what I&#039;ve read, one of the biggest challenges of the constitutionality debate is the Constitution&#039;s broad definitions for taxation. These imposed fines could just as easily be re-defined as taxes in order to accommodate the usage. <br />I mean- constitutional interpretation aside, I agree with that portion of the bill on a purely principle level. Ultimately, someone has to absorb the costs of uninsured patients. From what I understand, these are generally the hospitals- which subsequently leads to diminished quality of care and higher costs for the rest of us. <br /><br />Billz- what are your feelings on the other portions of the bill that forbids lifetime caps for insurance providers, extends coverage for children and prohibits denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions? And also about the cost caps for drug companies?

				What are your feelings about car insurance and being forced to buy that? It&#039;s insurance that you must buy in order to not shift your costs onto someone else when an accident happens. From my understanding of the bill, people who make too much for medicaid will receive subsidies. The cost of medical bills they will not be paying out of pocket and medication (and God forbid they need catastrophic care coverage, they&#039;d be bankrupted) will roughly even out to the amount that they are paying out of pocket for coverage and the plans will be much more affordable in general. If they choose not to buy a regular plan they will be able to buy a plan that only covers emergencies and catastrophic care that is meant for those under 30 for a nominal amount compared to what plans cost out of pocket now. Most of the American public will see no changes at all to their current insurance unless they have none.

				I&#039;m not happy about the bill due to the lack of public option. I&#039;m hoping that will come in time.<br />My partner does not receive insurance from his employer. He makes under $30,000, pays his taxes,<br />does &quot;the right things&quot; and yet can&#039;t afford to see a doctor or get a prescription when he&#039;s ill.

				NTrain, health care rationing does not exist and was never a part of the bill. That is a buzz word made up by politicians to scare you and sway public opinion. Please do some factual research about this bill. Here is an article from factcheck.org, an independent organization designed to root out the lies that politicians tell us. I can&#039;t believe that you would object to not allowing insurance companies to deny anyone care that they need. Honestly and truly, if anyone that you love were sick and dropped from their insurance company thereby bankrupting their family or killing them, I think you may change your mind on that. Private industry needs regulation. Any cursory glance at the financial industry and how it has gotten us into this economic cluster f*ck due to lack of regulation and oversight will tell you that. The millions of new customers that insurance will receive will surely offset the costs of the money they currently save from their immoral practices. P.S., there is no public option. It is not in the bill.<br /><br />http://www.factcheck.org/2010/03/a-final-weekend-of-whoppers/

				<em>The healthcare bill is so full of pork and special interests, it will waste our hard-earned tax dollars.</em><br /><br />Generally, I distrust ANYthing the gov&#039;t does, and am hardly a flag-waving Obama fanatic. <br /><br />But if we can establish a socialized medical system, I say let&#039;s go for it! When I got sick in France many years ago, not only did the doctor pay a house call, the visit was completely free. Meds were cheap. I&#039;m not the only person to have experienced this.<br /><br />My only problem with this bill, is that I can&#039;t imagine it&#039;ll go smoothly, or that it really has Americans&#039; best interests in mind. Do I know all the details? No. Do I want some serious reform? Hell yes. <br /><br />The gov&#039;t is plenty talented at wasting our hard-earned money. Google &quot;CityTime NYC&quot; to see a perfect example of $700 million + wasted on city employee <em>punch clocks.</em>&nbsp; :x<br /><br />And it&#039;s silly to think of it as Democrats vs Republicans.

I am bracing for whatever the increase is going to be this year. &nbsp;The bill that passed seems to have little in the way of keeping costs and premiums down. &nbsp;I know there are some provisions that will mandate a certain percentage of dollars go towards medical care so maybe that will help but as is the case with most of this stuff, only time will tell.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I also have a big problem with health insurance costs. I&#039;m paying over $50 every week for health insurance through my employer (a fairly small business). Our plan premiums jumped by 30% from 2009 to 2010. It is ridiculous, and I am scared of what the future brings in terms of health insurance costs.<br /><br />Now, I have not read the bill. I doubt anyone yet in this thread has actually read the bill either. But, from what I&#039;ve gathered, there are actually some things in the bill that are to take a look at costs and see how to better manage them and build on those ideas later, i.e. pilot programs. The New Yorker had an interesting article in December about past uses of pilot programs, for anyone interested: How the Senate bill would contain the cost of health care (http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/12/14/091214fa_fact_gawande)<br /><br />One of the biggest problems with our health care system is that no one really seems to know exactly why our health care is so much more expensive than much of the rest of the world&#039;s health care, without generally better results to go along with it, and how we can turn things around to make treatment more cost effective without people feeling like they&#039;re not getting good care. It&#039;s not as easy as going, &quot;An MRI should cost fifty bucks.&quot; It&#039;s more like going, &quot;Would this patient really benefit from the MRI? Are you just giving it to them because it would ease their mind, even though you already pretty much know what the problem is? Will doing this improve their prognosis?&quot; etc. Basically it&#039;s not just about costs, it&#039;s also about behavior, both on the part of doctors, hospitals, and patients. And insurance companies are there to make a profit off of that mess.<br /><br />So rather than making up some arbitrary rules to keep costs and premiums down, select people involved will have to start doing things to look at ways to manage costs through more sensible and effective treatment methods and better care coordination, and try to think of how to improve quality of care and not just quantity of care. In the meantime, millions of people who did not have access to health insurance before will now be able to get it.

				I just gotta inject this moment of reality. <br /><br />No matter what, you will pay for healthcare. Whether you pay an HMO or you pay through your taxes. you will pay. <br /><br />I think, at least for me, I support a more socialized system because it evens out how you pay. And it doesn&#039;t penalize you if you have a major health issue that costs tens of thousands of dollars. In other words, it will lead to a more equitable system.<br /><br />But, there is no such thing as free healthcare.<br /><br />I&#039;m only saying this because one is opening oneself up to ridicule if one makes the utopian argument that healthcare in other countries is free and that a reason to support it.

That makes it look as if officials have something to hide. Instead, they could have published the reports but put on the cover this authoritative disclaimer from former Enron adviser Paul Krugman: &quot;In Britain, the government itself runs the hospitals and employs the doctors. We&#039;ve all heard scare stories about how that works in practice; these stories are false.&quot;<br /><br />Thank goodness these stories are false, because some of them, like this one from London&#039;s Daily Mail, is truly horrifying:<br /><br />&#160; &#160; A man of 22 died in agony of dehydration after three days in a leading teaching hospital. <br /><br />&#160; &#160; Kane Gorny was so desperate for a drink that he rang police to beg for their help. <br /><br />&#160; &#160; They arrived on the ward only to be told by doctors that everything was under control. <br /><br />&#160; &#160; The next day his mother Rita Cronin found him delirious and he died within hours. <br /><br />&#160; &#160; She said nurses had failed to give him vital drugs which controlled fluid levels in his body. &#039;He was totally dependent on the nurses to help him and they totally betrayed him.&#039; <br /><br />Meanwhile, here&#039;s a story of someone facing bankruptcy owing to medical costs. The twist is he&#039;s Canadian. From the Toronto Sun:<br /><br />&#160; &#160; Suffering from brain cancer, Kent Pankow was literally forced to go to the ayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. for lifesaving surgery--at a cost to family and friends of $106,000--after the health-care system in Alberta left him hanging in bureaucratic limbo for 16 crucial days, his tumour meanwhile migrating to an unreachable part of the brain, while it dithered over his case file, ultimately deciding he was not surgery worthy.<br /><br />&#160; &#160; Now, with the Mayo Clinic having done what the Alberta Cancer Board wouldn&#039;t authorize or even explain, but with the tumour unable to be totally removed, the province will now not fund the expensive drug, Avastin, that the Mayo prescribed to keep him alive and keep the remaining tumour from increasing in size--despite the costs of the drug being totally funded by the province for other forms of cancer.<br /><br />&#160; &#160; Kent Pankow, as it turns out, has the right disease but he has it in the wrong place.<br /><br />&#160; &#160; Had he lung cancer, breast cancer, or colon cancer, then the cost of the drug--$4,555 per treatment, two times a month--would be totally covered by Alberta&#039;s version of OHIP [Ontario Health Insurance Plan].<br /><br />&#160; &#160; But he doesn&#039;t.<br /><br />&#160; &#160; And so he is not only a victim of brain cancer, he is also a victim of arbitrary discrimination.<br /><br />The good news is that President Obama remains committed to bringing U.S. health care into line with Canadian standards.

				Back to healthcare.<br /><br />I posted earlier about &quot;Obamacare&quot; being close to what the Heritage Foundation once proposed. Here&#039;s a link to a 1993 Reason Magazine article about it.<br />http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1568/is_n5_v25/ai_14536873/pg_2/?tag=content;col1 (http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1568/is_n5_v25/ai_14536873/pg_2/?tag=content;col1)<br /><br />Here&#039;s a couple of paragraphs I want to highlight. <br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">In a nutshell, Heritage proposes that consumers be able to choose from among a host of health-care options ranging from traditional insurers to health maintenance organizations (HMOs). Using refundable tax credits that decrease as income grows, Heritage would empower families to choose plans on the basis of coverage, service, and price. As part of the &quot;healthcare social contract&quot; thus formed, Butler says, heads of households would be required by law to buy basic health-care coverage &quot;to protect society from citizens who would try to exploit the good nature of ordinary Americans&quot; by free-riding on the system.<br /><br />The tax deduction for employer-provided health insurance would be phased out, in favor of the family-based tax credit. Families could still choose to join group plans. But by helping people buy insurance directly, rather than relying on employers to provide it, Heritage would solve the &quot;portability&quot; problem, in which employees are trapped in undesirable jobs because they&#039;re afraid of losing health coverage.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />And a synopsis of the AHIP 2009 proposal. <br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">AHIP’s plan to expand coverage had several key components:<br /><br />Provide Medicaid to all those under 100% FPL.<br />Provide tax credits for those up to 400% FPL to buy private insurance<br />Force everyone to buy private health insurance with an individual mandate<br />Some new regulations like ending guaranteed issue<br />Have state agencies one stop place to buy insurance for small employers and individuals (state-based exchanges)<br />“Allowing benefit packages to vary based on actuarial equivalence<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So, can someone please explain to me why Obamacare is so evil if it is similar to what a conservative think tank and a health Insurance advocacy group basically propose the same thing.<br /><br />I got both quotes through this article. <br />http://fdlaction.firedoglake.com/2010/03/30/new-health-care-law-a-republican-plan-that-should-make-insurance-companies-proud/ (http://fdlaction.firedoglake.com/2010/03/30/new-health-care-law-a-republican-plan-that-should-make-insurance-companies-proud/)<br /><br /><br /><br />

You have no choice as to what is government approved insurance. Want to pay for your own preventative care? Nope, has to be in your insurance. No threat of developing an addiction?

Major Medical policies are underwritten differently than most basic coverage.<br /><br />You would have to agree to a $5,000 per illness, per person before this policy would be written.<br /><br />If you were a typical family of, let&#039;s say for the sake of this discussion, 3 and your child broke a leg riding their bike . . . that&#039;s $5,000. Your spouse developed acute appendicitis . . . that&#039;s another $5,000 and then you found a breast lump . . . you just spent $15,000 and you haven&#039;t yet factored in the cost of this policy. Let&#039;s say the policy costs only $5,000 per year . . . now we are up to $20,000. But wait there is one more thing. All Major Medical family policies currently being written carry a per person maximum. Let&#039;s say $100,000. <br /><br />Now lets change your kid&#039;s broken leg to a leukemia. You&#039;ll spend that $100,000 very quickly. The remaining $250,000 will be your problem, and you won&#039;t be able to get that kid insured ever again because of the preexisting condition.<br /><br />Let&#039;s say that your breast lump turns out to be a cancer. Do you have any idea how expensive chemotherapy and radiation treatments are?<br /><br />Aren&#039;t you willing to understand that there are 45,000,000, that&#039;s Forty-Five-Million men, women and children who don&#039;t have coverage from their employers. <br /><br />Can&#039;t we just take a wait-and-see on the new health care bill.<br /><br />What do we have to lose?<br /><br />How about during your spouses appendectomy the surgeon discovers kidney disease. Unless your spouse can receive a kidney from some member of the family, the cost of transportation to and from a transplant center is not a covered expense, and the cost of dialysis is prohibitive as is the cost of a potential transplantation surgery along with the extended hospital stay . . .<br /><br />You will become just another statistic of a middle class family going into poverty trying to pay back all the medical expenses for the rest of your lives and all of you being denied any medical coverage for the rest of your lives because of preexisting conditions.

				I have. <br /><br />Not having insurance meant that I delayed seeking medical attention for what turned out to be a serious health issue. If I&#039;d waited another year or two, it could have been much worse - harder to treat, more expensive, more difficult recovery. <br /><br />Luckily I did get insurance and got it checked out and got the care I needed.

I was considered a freelancer even though I worked full time at a company, which meant I got no benefits. Luckily I had no health problems that required a doctor visit during that time, because if I did, for one thing I wouldn&#039;t have been able to afford much treatment, and for another thing I knew that it would become a pre-existing condition that I wouldn&#039;t be able to get coverage for once I did get health insurance. So if I did start to feel sick, like enigmacat, I probably wouldn&#039;t have gone to the doctor until it became so bad I knew it was something serious. It sucks to live that way. <br /><br />No matter how generally healthy anyone is, you never know when something&#039;s going to happen- accidents, disease, etc. Soon after I got Healthy NY (which I qualified for because I was poor, but not poor enough for Medicaid) I had to get outpatient surgery for a minor thing that would&#039;ve cost me something like $3000 if my insurance hadn&#039;t been there to pay for it. And that&#039;s not counting the doctors&#039; appointments, ultrasounds, and follow-up visits that came along with it. My Healthy NY premiums jumped 20% after my first year, to about 10% of my measly salary. $220 per month is a lot of money for someone who makes under $25,000 a year, and that was the approximate cut-off at that time to qualify for it.<br /><br />But I still paid for it because the alternative - going bankrupt if you get seriously ill or injured - is bullshit.

				I have as well. &nbsp;I happen to work as an animator. &nbsp;The field of animation is by nature a freelance business. &nbsp;The majority of us bounce from job to job, because the entertainment business is not the traditional steady job most everyone else has. &nbsp;We work on commercials, television series, movies, etc, and when the project finishes, we finish. &nbsp;When a show goes on hiatus, we are &quot;laid off&quot;. &nbsp;Most of the time, it does not mean we are hired back, and it&#039;s a long time to wait to get hired back. &nbsp;So you find other work. &nbsp;If we are lucky enough to get insurance from one of our gigs, it will end when the project ends. &nbsp;I have been in this business for over 10 years. &nbsp;I love what I do. &nbsp;I do not want to give it up. &nbsp;But it is a tradeoff. &nbsp;Not having access to regular, steady, quality, and affordable health care insurance is a real hardship. &nbsp;Over the course of my career, I have had so many different insurance plans, I can&#039;t remember. &nbsp;Some from employers, some from the freelancer&#039;s union, and some from Healthy NY. &nbsp;And sometimes I&#039;ve gone without. &nbsp;I hate it. &nbsp;I wish I didn&#039;t have to search every year for a new health care plan. &nbsp;I wish I had a normal job sometimes. &nbsp;I wish just that health insurance were more affordable in this country. &nbsp;Why must I walk around in fear that if I get sick, that I will go bankrupt because my health insurance is non-existent or a crappy plan? &nbsp;It&#039;s all nice when you work for a company that provides you with insurance, but when you are like the thousands out there like me, it is very difficult. &nbsp;I am not ashamed to say that right now, I am on a government program called Healthy NY that subsidizes my health insurance plan. &nbsp;It&#039;s not the greatest plan in the world but it&#039;s better than nothing. &nbsp;And it&#039;s not cheap, even with the subsidy. &nbsp; I won&#039;t qualify for this next year, most likely, and once again, I&#039;ll be up s___&#039;s creek. &nbsp;I&#039;ll have to search around again, to find something that will cover me. &nbsp;I can&#039;t tell you how much I hate dealing with this year after year. &nbsp;<br /><br />As it stands right now, I&#039;m not even sure this health care reform will help me. &nbsp;It&#039;s been whittled down so much and I might not even qualify for a subsidy. &nbsp;To me, this reform is just a start.

				My interest is that I think many people think that purchasing medical insurance is the same as purchasing medical care -- it&#039;s not. When you say &#039;...sticking an insurance company with a bill or &#039;redistribution of wealth&#039; it make me wonder that&#039;s all.<br /><br />First, a medical insurance company does not pay the bills for medical care. The insured and everyone else who pays into the plan pays for it. Healthy people subsidize those who are sick so if any one is being stuck it&#039;s healthy people.<br /><br />Second, the whole concept of &#039;insurance&#039; is socialism at it&#039;s best. Groups of people come together and pool their resources for the good of the group. Resources contributed by the healthy are redistributed to those who are sicker. In most insurance plans today, if you need ongoing care for an illness it most likely it comes on someone else&#039;s dime.<br /><br />That&#039;s why I asked if you have insurance. This &#039;re-distribution&#039; is the price of admission of having insurance. If you feel so strongly on not having someone else pay for the services you receive, I would think you would opt out entirely so as not to put yourself in that position.<br /><br />I have medical insurance by the way. I pay for it and am relatively healthy and rarely go to the doctor. I feel many people go to the doctor unnessarily, and that is a legimate complaint. But in general I don&#039;t mind paying in more than I take out. But if I pay in, I expect to be covered in the event I fall sick or am injured in the future.<br /><br />In Debbie&#039;s case, you made an assumption about &#039;pre-existing condition&#039;. It wasn&#039;t clear to me what came first the insurance or the illness. It sounded like the child had insurance, was diagnosed with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and then was denied coverage. If this is the case, it&#039;s not right. &nbsp;<br /><br />If you paid into an insurance plan for years and relied on it to help defray medical costs for yourself and/or your family and then god forbid developed a chronic condition, would you be willing to sit back and let the insurance company say f--off?
