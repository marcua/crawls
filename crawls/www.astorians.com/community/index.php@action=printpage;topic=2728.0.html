				Yup - 30th Ave between 36th and 37th.&nbsp; I think.&nbsp; My tendency to enjoy their caipirinhas makes my knowledge of the cross streets a little hazy....&nbsp; :evil:<br /><br />Anyway, here&#39;s my top 5, in alphabetical order:<br /><br />lil bistro 33<br />sabor tropical<br />718<br />trattoria l&#39;incontro<br />tournesol (yes, I know it&#39;s lic)<br />wave thai (although I wish they would make it more spicy - last time I ate an entire jar of their thai bird chilis along with my crispy duck salad - they had to cut up more chilis for me)<br /><br />hm, that&#39;s 6.<br /><br />I also like kebab cafe but haven&#39;t been there in a long time - time to go back, I think.<br /><br />Other specific dishes:<br /><br />-huitlacoche quesadillas at tacos mexico<br />-burgers at jackson hole<br />-many apps at agnanti<br /><br />Perhaps more to come later - work is interfering at the moment....<br />

				megc, LIC is my hands down favorite bar in &quot;the neighborhood.&quot;&nbsp; It&#39;s kind of a pain in the ass to get to, but they have great beer, a nice patio, and a panini press behind the bar you&#39;re feeling peckish.&nbsp; Oh, and a photobooth.&nbsp; All the best bars have photobooths. Aside from the Beer Garden it&#39;s the only bar in the area my non-Astoria friends will come to out here.&nbsp; <br />I&#39;d throw out some restaurants but I&#39;m so bad with names, I just sort of know where the places are.&nbsp; <br />For example, the bakery near 28th Ave and Steinway which my girlfriend now tells me is Laziza. My mother from Syracuse sends requests for when I head up there.<br />There&#39;s a great French spot on Broadway between 44th and 45th.&nbsp; <br />I recently fell in love with JJ&#39;s Sweet Potato Tempura roll, but that place wins for area sushi in my book.<br />There are more, I just can&#39;t keep them all straight.

				Did anyone notice in the new issue of New York magazine -- the annual cheap eats issue (my favorite) -- that Sripraphai is number 5 and Kebab Cafe is number 52 (out of 101)?<br /><br />Also Spicy &amp; Tasty is number 10 and Tournesol is number 62. And Malagueta on 36th Ave is number 80. I&#39;ve never even heard of that place!<br /><br />Sad part is I&#39;ve only been to two of these places, and one of those two was like 3 years ago.&nbsp; So really that&#39;s only one. :-( I seriously need to fix that soon.

				What a great thread!<br /><br />After 5+ years in Astoria, I&#39;ve definitely got a few favorites!<br /><br />* Telly&#39;s Taverna - great grilled fish, lamb chops, and shrimp. And free honey-covered dough-balls (mmm, dough-balls...) on Friday nights (I think it&#39;s Fridays).<br />* Trattoria L&#39;Incontro for special occasions<br />* Le Sans Souci<br />* Malagueta is great!! (MandaT, you should definitely check it out)<br />* Igloo for casual fare<br />* Balkh Shish Kebab (I always get bolani kadu - pumpkin-filled turnover appetizers, fish kebab and rice with raisins &amp; carrots and extra white sauce!)<br />* Fatty&#39;s Cafe for burger &amp; sweet potato fries<br /><br />New favorites<br />* Watawa - had good Japanese food there once<br />* Nebuta - excellent new cheap Japanese take-out<br />* Lil Bistro 33<br />* Wave Thai<br />* San Antonio Bakery<br />* Little Colombian bakery on Steinway near Broadway (can&#39;t remember the name) <br /><br />Also really want to try<br />* Tournesol<br />* Film Chefs<br />* Sunswick<br />* Locale<br />* Kabab Cafe<br /><br />And I know there are others I&#39;m forgetting but these are the first that come to mind! I just got a book - the Chowhound&#39;s Guide to the New York tri-state area - for my birthday, which is great - and includes several restaurants in Astoria (like Balkh, Telly&#39;s, Malagueta, Kabab Cafe). But a wee bit out of date since VOLO is still on there, and I would have included that on my list as a favorite - who remembers that place? It was so great, alas, now it is Tutankhamun Cafe, which I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve tried, but just does not appeal to me as much for some reason...<br /><br />-Abby

				Thanks for the extra info about LIC Bar, KidMurdock.&nbsp; I definitely want to check it out.&nbsp; Sounds like a nice place for an astorians gathering in the heat of August. <br /><br />And yes, Laziza is pretty awesome!&nbsp; I love the grabeh, but the mamoul is also amazing there (love the rings filled with dates and no sugar on the outside).&nbsp; I&#39;ve also enjoyed their baklawa items filled especially with pistachio.<br /><br />The Broadway place you&#39;re talking about is Le Sans Souci.<br /><br />Am also interested in checking out Stove.&nbsp; And, apparently, Christos Steakhouse around the corner from me on 23rd Ave, has steaks that rival Peter Luger.<br /><br />I have also enjoyed Brick, but it has unfortunate associations for me.<br /><br />And JD, glad you can use the recommendations!&nbsp; You are so lucky to live so close to Sunswick.&nbsp; :)<br />

				I have only been to Stove once and really enjoyed. I would love to go back. <br /><br />I just tried LIC bar about 2 weeks ago and was not that impressed. The garden area was nice, but the rest of the bar was really dark, there were a ton of flies (EW!) and it smelled like stale beer. Maybe I just went on an off day? I am always willing to give a place a second chance. <br /><br />My next place on my list of places to try is 718- I don&#39;t get down to Ditmars much- but I have heard good things. <br /><br />

				Took my French friend to Tournesol last week, VERY friendly busperson and terrific service! We just had an appetizer with a glass of wine (friend was at the end of a three-week vacation and nearly out of $$$ at that point.)&nbsp; <br /><br />Guess she&#39;s not as qualified to review the place as most French people would be- she subsists primarily on fast food at home :roll:<br /><br />Now I need to check out Le Sans Souci.&nbsp; 718 is nice and all (had my sister&#39;s bridal shower there) but not as down-to-earth as I&#39;d like.

				Ok, ok, Jackson Hole isn&#39;t technically in Astoria, either.&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; But it&#39;s close enough to us so that I always forget that.&nbsp; It&#39;s just off of Ditmars on something like 72nd, which is a block or two past Hazen, so it&#39;s not as far as it sounds (it skips from something like 49th to 71st).<br /><br />Ok, I was close.&nbsp; Here&#39;s the website (http://www.jacksonholeburgers.com/location.asp?locid=13).&nbsp; It&#39;s at 69-35 Astoria Boulevard, on the corner of 70th - actually between 70th and Hazen.&nbsp; My only complaint about the burgers is that they&#39;re steam-grilled, not char-grilled, but they&#39;re big, and more importantly, always fresh and very tasty.&nbsp;

				My sis and I ordered some &#39;za from Napoli for dinner.&nbsp; Whoa!&nbsp; Soooooo good!!&nbsp; The price was really reasonable ($15 for a big-ass pizza with two toppings), it got here fast, it was ludicrously hot, and delicious.&nbsp; The sauce was all basily and fresh-tasting, and the pizza itself was sort of oddly shaped - obviously stretched by hand which is so cool.&nbsp; The crust was divine; the perfect marriage of flavor, crispness, and thickness.&nbsp; We will definitely be ordering from there again.&nbsp; I wonder what their pastas are like. I need to drop by for a menu! And it&#39;s so close to my apartment!!<br /><br />

One &quot;serving&quot; will feed you at least twice. Everything is so flavorful. And cheap! Dinner for 2 with sodas will cost you like $20. That&#39;s practically nothing! I don&#39;t eat red meat so i personally can&#39;t vouch for their dishes but here are my faves:<br />penne alla vodka (w/ no mushrooms, i&#39;m severely allergic)<br />baked ziti<br />manicotti<br />chicken francese<br />chicken parm<br /><br />and the calamari appetizer and their mozzarella sticks rock as well.<br /><br />god, i hope that&#39;s where i&#39;m having dinner with my friend tonight...if not i need to eat there soon.<br />JD if you&#39;re up for eating there, i&#39;ll happily dine with you! (even if i eat there tonight, i can sooo do another night)<br />if you go on your own beware of one thing. you get lovely plain warm bread, but they&#39;ll ask if you want regular or garlic...the garlic is good but not great...and you have to pay for it. best to stick with the regular bread...which the butter just melts on...<br /><br />great now i have to go cover phones with a rumbly tummy...

				Although generally what Mundo has is good, I have a mixed bag experience with them.&nbsp; :-P<br />For example, their chicken salad (I forgot what they call it but it&#39;s basically greens with grilled chicken and a ton of oil) is covered in oil and lacks flavor,<br />while their veggie burger is absolutely delish as are most of their appetizers,...<br /><br />So it&#39;s really can be hit or miss.&nbsp; :roll:<br /><br />what i like about the place is the relaxed ambience, there&#39;s no rush whatsoever.&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				Brand new poster.&nbsp; Hello, all.<br /><br />My fiance, Tegan, and I moved to Astoria in April 2005 and have really enjoyed our time here.&nbsp; (Although, a little more public green space would be great, and I&#39;m going to guess that is common opinion around here).<br /><br />Thought this was a great thread to start into, as we have still only touched the surface of dining spots in the area.&nbsp; So, this has provided a bunch of recommendations.&nbsp; Thanks!<br /><br />I finally did see a <strong>Cavo</strong> mention.&nbsp; I&#39;m definitely a fan, with the acknowledgement that it is an expensive night out.&nbsp; I&#39;m already looking forward to sangria and pitas on the patio in the Spring.<br /><strong><br />Thai Chili </strong>(45th &amp; Broadway) is our favorite spot, mostly for delivery, but the eating in is really nice as well.<br /><br />And, if you are a vegetarian sushi fan definitely check out <strong>Bai Sushi</strong> (37th &amp; Broadway, I think), as they have a delightful vegetarian platter.&nbsp; The fish is usually pretty good too.<br /><br />Matt<br /><br />Here&#39;s to a world full of listening and understanding.<br /><br /><br />

				Without a doubt out favorite restaurant is Bangkok Tasty .&nbsp; It&#39;s not much to look at, and we thought it was initially a Chinese restaurant trying to be creative by serving fake Thai food (partially because it used to be a Chinese restaurant).&nbsp; But we were wrong.&nbsp; Real Thai people serving excellent Thai food. It can be on the spicy side, but it&#39;s worth every tear shed.&nbsp; In fact it&#39;s more of a take-out place than a real restaurant but you can sit and eat there as well if you really feel the need to.&nbsp; &nbsp;:mrgreen:

Much better than my previous attempts to eat there! (I believe previously I&#39;d gotten noodle dishes as part of the lunch special. Perhaps they have the non-talented cooks over the lunch hour?) I got the sausage salad (spicy), which was bright and tasty and meaty, with plenty of vegetables to balance the sausage. One of the better Thai salad&#39;s I&#39;ve had. (Better than Wave&#39;s papaya salad, which is a low spot on their menu, but nowhere near Sripraprai&#39;s watercress salad.) And I got the vegetable panang curry, which was not quite as good, but reasonably well done. I wish they hadn&#39;t used 75% bamboo shoots for the vegetables, though. Overall, B.T. moves up in my view from &quot;insipid&quot; to &quot;pretty good takeout&quot;.

				My List is as follows:<br /><br />Steinway/Broadway Side of Astoria:<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u"><strong>El Sitio - 36th Ave under the &quot;EL&quot;</strong> </span> - If you go on a Tues., Wed., or Thursday the owner is usually there and he does the cooking.&nbsp; Food is really good, especially their &quot;Ropa Vieja&quot; (translation is shredded clothes!).&nbsp; What it is, is shredded beef in tomato sauce.<br /><br /><strong><span class="bbc_u">Agnante - Ditmars &amp; 19th St. (Across from Astoria Park)</span></strong> Great food, I&#39;ve ordered just about everything on their menu and it&#39;s all good and the service is great, very friendly.<br /><br /><strong><span class="bbc_u">El Olivo - 31st St btw Ditmars &amp; 21st Avenue</span></strong> - ORDER THE PAELLA AND SANGRIA...all I can say is OH MY GOD!!!!&nbsp; The portion of paella is so large that you can take home a doggy bag and have a full meal for the next day!!!&nbsp; The Sangria is homemade, order the pitcher, you&#39;re going to end up drining more than one glass.<br /><br /><strong><span class="bbc_u">Tellys Taverna &amp; Taverna Kycylades</span></strong> - The best seafood, if you like octopus....<br /><br /><strong><span class="bbc_u">Cavo</span></strong> - The bartenders are very tasty<br /><br /><strong><span class="bbc_u">Fatty&#39;s Cafe</span></strong> - They have the best Sunday Brunch in Astoria.<br /><br /><strong><span class="bbc_u">Mary McGuires</span></strong> - The place is pretty rough BUT on Tuesday nights it&#39;s buffalo wing night and they&#39;re not bad, actually they&#39;re good and you can get 20 pieces for 4.60 (and happy hour beer to go along with it).<br /><br /><br />

				I know how to make those croquettes at home. &nbsp;You can make them out of anything, ham, chicken, cod, tuna, etc.<br /><br />If you know how to make Bechemel sauce (if you&#39;re Greek you prolly do to make Pistacio) the dough is made the same way except you use more flour (in my case, I like to use cornstarch better).
