The Frank Sinatra School of the Arts Orchestra will make a guest appearance.<br />Call 917.460.4289or visit www.AstoriaMusic.org for more information.<br />HOW MUCH: Tickets are $20/$15 for students and seniors, FSSA students FREE and FREE for kids under 12.<br /><br />Astoria Symphony Launches its 2010-2011 Concert Season<br />at the Frank Sinatra School of the Arts<br /><br />The ASTORIA SYMPHONY will launch its eigth season under Music Director Silas Nathaniel Huff on Friday, October 1st, 2010, at the Frank Sinatra School of the Arts, in the heart of Astoria. The Astoria Symphony’s Opening Night Celebration will feature music of the cinema, and a special guest appearance by the Frank Sinatra School of the Arts’ own orchestra alongside the Astoria Symphony’s professional musicians. <br /><br />Maestro Huff will lead the Astoria Symphony through excerpts from Stromenn A Salute to Cinema, MOZART Eine Kleine Nachmusik OFFENBACH Barcarolle, Megan Pachecano &amp; Allyson Herman, PUCCINI &quot;O Mio Babbino Caro,&quot; Allyson Herman, soprano, ROSSINI William Tell Overture, GRIEG Peer Gynt Suite, ENNIO MORRICONE Music from The Good, The Bad, &amp; The Ugly, ELMER BERNSTEIN Music from The Magnificent Seven, and a Tribute to John Williams.<br /><br />“The professional musicians of the Astoria Symphony are thrilled to play with the high school musicians,” explains Maestro Huff. “Education is a big part of our mission, and what better way is there to share our passion with young people than to invite them on stage with us?” The collaboration has been in the works for some time, says Huff, and will allow young players to have a professional music-making experience. “For fifteen minutes they will sit amongst professional players and be expected to play professional level music to the same audience the Astoria plays to. They are a very talented ensemble, and Mr. Lieberson has prepared them very well, so I expect a rousing success, of course.”<br /><br /><br />The concert will begin at 8:00 pm, though Maestro Huff will lead a free pre-concert discussion at 7:30 pm as part of the Astoria Symphony’s new “Meet the Maestro” initiative. An open reception will follow, allowing the audience an opportunity to meet and greet the Symphony musicians, the soloist, and Maestro Huff. Tickets cost $20, though students and senior citizens are entitled to discounted tickets at $15. FSSA students children 12 &amp; under and all students of the Frank Sinatra School of the Arts will be permitted free-of-charge. <br /><br />After the concert, we will be heading over to the Uno Chicago Grill in Astoria to meet the maestro, the musicians and socialize together. The Uno Chicago Grill has agreed to support our fundraising efforts and donate 15% of each AMS patron’s bill back to our organization! <br /><br />ABOUT THE ARTISTS:<br /><br />Silas Nathaniel Huff has conducted outstanding orchestral, choral, opera, ballet, and new music performances for more than a dozen years.
