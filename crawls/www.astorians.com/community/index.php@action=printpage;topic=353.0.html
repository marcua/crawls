				AXP, Amazon and the Tribeca Film Festival Launch Film Competition<br />Corporate Affairs &amp; Communications , March 07, 2005 <br />American Express, Amazon.com and Tribeca Film Festival founders Robert De Niro, Jane Rosenthal, and Craig Hatkoff, recently announced the launch of the Amazon Theater/Tribeca Film Festival Short-Film Competition, in recognition of the critical role that short films have played in the broader filmmaking world. <br />Through April 13, 2005, Amazon.com will accept short-film submissions (two to seven minutes in length) for entry into the competition. Details can be found at www.amazon.com/shortfilms. <br /><br />Amazon.com customers will be able to view the submitted films in the Tribeca Screening Room on Amazonâ€™s Web site, where they will be invited to rate the films on a scale from one to five, using the existing Amazon.com star rating system. Additionally, five celebrity jurors will review selected film submissions alongside Amazon.com customers and provide their commentary on this site. <br /><br />The five highest-rated films will be screened at Tribeca Cinemas in New York City and will also run over a period of four weeks on the Amazon.com home page, which is visited by millions of customers each day. The top filmmaker as rated by Amazon.com customers will receive a grant for his or her next film, which will be awarded in the form of an American Express prepaid card in the amount of $50,000. The winning filmmaker will be announced at the end of June. <br /><br />&quot;American Express is dedicated to the success of the Tribeca Film Festival, and to providing a great forum for filmmakers to showcase their creativity,&quot; said John Hayes. &quot;This new relationship with Amazon will help extend the Festival to a whole new audience online and continue to foster the great sense of community of movie fans and filmmakers already established by the Festival.&quot;<br /><br />The 2005 Tribeca Film Festival presented by American Express will take place from April 19 to May 1 in various locations throughout lower Manhattan. The 2005 Festival will feature special events and screenings, a street fair, and panel discussions with noted filmmakers.
