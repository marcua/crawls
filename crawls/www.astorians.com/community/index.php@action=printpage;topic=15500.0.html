				Hello all -<br /><br />Anyone interested in playing in some friendly PU roller hockey games in Astoria, please email me: tmcgonagle19@yahoo.com<br /><br />I&#039;ve been rounding up people on the streets (stopping strangers who are carrying hockey gear) and we&#039;ve got a few people now - all we need is a few more to have a decent, hopefully consistent number.&nbsp; If you&#039;re aware of any already existing PU games, please share as well.<br /><br />Thanks!

				Where would u be playing in astoria ?&nbsp; &nbsp;I know the outdoor rink on 28st and 34 ave is being over run by mexicans playing soccer every weekend and they have destroyed the boards , ripped out the yellow lining which allowed the puck to be whipped around the rink . The people who run or ran the rink now lock up the nets too as they were getting messed up also .&nbsp; &nbsp;I know some hockey players shoot around at hoyt park which is on 29st under the train&nbsp; next to neptune diner and they are always shooting around . Most of the time they dont have a goalie though.

				Location is open to suggestion - it&#039;d be nice to make use of that rink somehow - whether that requires playing weeknights or cleaning it up a bit.&nbsp; Perhaps I can track down a contact to the management of the park.<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard of the games by Hoyt park, perhaps that&#039;s the best starting place.&nbsp; As I said, any and all suggestions are welcome.&nbsp; I personally plan on checking out Hoyt this Saturday AM, and maybe doing some local scouting elsewhere as well.

				Usually people get to hoyt around 1pm or maybe even later . Those late nights rnt easy to get up early from the next day as&nbsp; i know alot of the guys r around there are 21-23 yrs old .&nbsp; I went by there last sunday and it was great to skate around , but the goalie never showed .&nbsp; &nbsp;Only dedicated hockey fans shoot at a garbage can turned on its side :)

				The rink is run by the YMCA is Long Island City (on behalf of the City).&#160; The adjacent school (144 I believe) doesn&#039;t really have anything to do with it.&#160; But I doubt the Y would allow use of the nets for anything other than league games.<br /><br />If more people play hockey there, you&#039;d see less soccer being played there.&#160; Trust me, those guys are harmless, and they certainly wouldn&#039;t mess with a bunch of guys carrying sticks.&#160; All they want to do is play soccer.&#160; But if the rink was actually being used for hockey, they&#039;d just look to play elsewhere.&#160; <br /><br />Heck, a few of them may probably end up watching.&#160; When I would play league games there, you&#039;d be surprised at the size of the Latin crowd who just stood around and watched.&#160; Remember, it&#039;s basically just soccer with skates and sticks.&#160; Not that difficult to follow along.<br /><br />The funny part was, since I&#039;m Latin, they would be kinda surprised to see me play as well.&nbsp; I&#039;d often get some puzzling looks after I took off my skates and walked home.&nbsp; But then again, as the only Brown person with equpment on, I should have expected them to be a little taken aback by me.

				I live in Bayside right next to the rink in Fort Totten Park.&nbsp; Every once in a while I go over there and skate around, but it&#039;s pretty run down and there&#039;s no goals, so I can see why nobody else uses it.&nbsp; I think people are starting to use it as a dog run since no one&#039;s ever there.&nbsp; But I&#039;ve been looking online since I moved to here 2 years ago, looking for any kind of league or games.&nbsp; If you guys get something going, I&#039;d definitely be interested.&nbsp; What kind of skill level are we talking anyway?&nbsp; I&#039;m no all-star or anything.

I&#039;m sure you know where that is, anyway I play net and still have all my gear so&nbsp; would be down to play. I know my brother would be down also, he plays roller in LI but has been looking for some games in the area. I know possibly 2 more people who would play as well. Are you looking to do something early during the weekends? I know the rink has gone to crud, unfortunately, but there are a couple of places we could still play. I live on 38th st and 20th rd, but the park here is used for a soccer league during the weekends. There is a rink in Whitestone that we could possibly carpool (I have a access to a car) to, that has nets available and a decent amount of people show up there, from what my other two friends have told me. I am excited that someone is interested in playing as I have been&nbsp; very anxious to play for a while now, especially here in Astoria. My email is frankp1282@gmail.com, I will hit you up or vice versa but I would really like to make something happen soon as the weather is perfect for some roller. We just need a location or possibly some people to pool in for a net?

				Not to keep this thread off-topic, but according to Merriam Webster:<br /><br />http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/infest<br />1 : to spread or swarm in or over in a troublesome manner &lt;a slum infested with crime&gt; &lt;shark-infested waters&gt;<br />2 : to live in or on as a parasite<br /><br />It makes no mention of the use of the word &quot;infest&quot; as specific to insects. While it does reference the word &quot;parasite&quot;, that is another word that is not necessarily exclusive to bugs or insects. <br /><br />Maybe this thread is infested with political correctness?&nbsp; :-o<br /><br />

				Dude I don&#039;t have an attitude but passing the puck around isn&#039;t playing the sport you love . I love the sport so much I made nets in my youth and you could&nbsp; take them apart to store when u not in use . Sorry u didn&#039;t like the suggestion but when I was younger<br />&nbsp; someone suggested the same exact thing to me and I did it
