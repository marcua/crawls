				OK, so being a fan of the GEICO commercials with the cavemen, I came across their website.&nbsp; &quot;www.cavemanscrib.com&quot;.<br /><br />It&#039;s an interactive site so while taking a time out from actual work I started to navigate.&nbsp; When you enter the living room there is an end table with a lamp on it.&nbsp; Next to the lamp are magazines.&nbsp; The top one is clickable.&nbsp; I believe the name of the mag is &quot;HIM&quot;.&nbsp; Approximately 5 clicks into the magazine there is a page that says &quot;The 5 Best cities of 2007&quot;.&nbsp; <br /><br />Number 1 says:&nbsp; &quot;When you&#039;re visiting New York, be sure to eat where the quality is guaranteed.&nbsp; Stop by Hays&#039; Deli in Astoria, Queens for the mouth-watering and famously ironic Bronto Burger.&quot;<br /><br />Of course I got all giddy and stuff.&nbsp; Then I wondered...is there really such a place?&nbsp; I&#039;ve lived here all of my life (going on 30 years) and the name does not ring a bell..AT ALL.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyone?

				No such place, they&#039;d have to charge ad fees if it were&nbsp; :roll:<br /><br />Guess they just read a back issue of Time Out NY to get some vague ideas of &quot;what&#039;s cool&quot; and remembered Astoria. Or something.

				I love the Geico cavemen too and checked out the crib a while back, it&#039;s hilarious.&nbsp; I hear there is a sitcom being made with them as the stars, not sure if it&#039;s too but I&#039;ll totally check it out if they do.

				ABC is developing a pilot about the Geico cavemen...it is basically being sold as a comedy about cavemen living in modern day Atlanta and dealing with the struggles of discrimination. Could be funny...or awful. Just shooting a pilot so who knows if it will ever air.

				ahaha speaking of duck with mango salsa...there is mention of it somewhere in his house and when I read it, I literally laughed out loud.&nbsp; It&#039;s either in his diary under his pillow, a list on his fridge or in one of the magazines he has lying around in the living room.<br /><br />I&#039;m such a voyeur.&nbsp; &nbsp;:oops:
