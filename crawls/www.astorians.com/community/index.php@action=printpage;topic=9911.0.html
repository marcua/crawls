				My girlfriend and I were going to go, but the timing is bad.&nbsp; Even though I&#039;m not a fan of the new record, that band is always a hoot live, and this is the first time they&#039;ve played in the area in like three years that I&#039;ve missed them.&nbsp; I hope you have a good ol time, and if you get a chance, I&#039;d recommend checking out Jason Isbell&#039;s live show the next time he plays.&nbsp;

				That Isbell show was great.&nbsp; The first time I saw him was the same night the Truckers played that free show at Castle Clinton, then two days later I saw the Truckers again at the Stone Pony.&nbsp; I wound up taking a 5 day weekend just because I knew how painful each morning after would be, but it was totally worth it, and it was one of the most fun weekends I&#039;ve had in a long time.<br />I wish Astoria had a place for shows even something Irving Plaza size would be awesome, and hopefully draw people to the hood.
