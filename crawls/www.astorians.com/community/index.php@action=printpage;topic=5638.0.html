				Wine cured dry sausage and pasta:<br /><br />Been working out a new recipe based upon talks and tastings with Ralph at Dave and Tony&#039;s Salumeria.&nbsp; They have a wine cured dry sausage that has a deeper earthy flavor than most other types.&nbsp; SO I went back to my kitchen and played around. Have made it 3 times now for clients and fairly happy with it. Please keep in mind that I work with recipes for 30-120 people. That&#039;s why I usually don&#039;t give exact measurements.<br /><br />Have them peel and slice paper thin 1 wine cured dry sausage<br />1 marinated whole hot cherry pepper (optional)<br />1 bunch parsley washed. Pluck whole leaves.<br />1 bunch basil washed. Pluck whole leaves, cut off roots and tie up stems into a bunch.<br />4 cloves garlic sliced not chopped<br />Good olive oil<br />Salt and pepper to taste<br />Grated parm cheese (best you can get). For addition at table if desired.<br /><br />Cooked pasta of choice.<br /><br />Put wine sausage, cherry pepper, basil stems and garlic in pot with enough oil to just cover. Bring to boil and reduce to low simmer for 1/2 hour.&nbsp; You are making an infused oil.&nbsp; If you keep it at a low simmer the sausage will wilt but not overcook and shrivel up.&nbsp; Taste it. Should be deep earthy meaty with back round of garlic and basil. Heat is from cherry pepper.&nbsp; When it&#039;s done, remove cherry pepper and basil stems.&nbsp; Season to taste.&nbsp; Put cooked warm pasta into large service bowl. Using slotted spoon get all the sausage and garlic into pasta and add enough of the oil to coat.&nbsp; Add in all basil and parsley leaves. Mix well. check for seasonings. Let sit a few minutes for leaves to slightly wilt. Serve with parm cheese on side.&nbsp; <br /><br />Save the oil for next meal.&nbsp; It&#039;s awesome.<br /><br /><br /><br />
