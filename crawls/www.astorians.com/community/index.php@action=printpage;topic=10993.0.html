				Hey slc717, welcome to Astoria. Nice to see another UCONNite around. <br /><br />I too miss wings-over-storrs and DP dough. Cheap, delicious and delivered at all hours of the night.

				I&#039;ll have to try McCann&#039;s. I have to say, as much as I like the cheap wings at Dillingers, they&#039;re just ok. I actually prefer the meatier wings from Ginos more than those at D&#039;s. It&#039;s hard to find wings as good as those around&nbsp; college campuses. (welcome fellow Connecticutian) Something about beer, frat boys and spicy chicken that&#039;s really just all about college. Waltham, MA had a fantastic wings place until...it burned down!&nbsp; &nbsp;:-D

				oh my god, a fellow Brandesian!&nbsp; :-o Astoria of all places!&nbsp; :-P Kill me, but I think it might have been Wings Express. It might have been well before your time. I&#039;m &#039;94. I heard it burned a few years later.<br /><br />...Sorry everyone this is a total sidetrack conversation! <br />There was also a FANFUCKINGTASTIC pizza place that was the BEST pizza. (and this is without beer talkin&#039;) Sorry, new york, haven&#039;t had a good once since Frank&#039;s. Frank&#039;s was good for a few years after &#039;94 and then it got bought out and went a little downhill...so I heard from my in-laws who tracked from Sougthborough to get some.<br /><br />o.k. back to the wings. Ah...I&#039;m sorry, if there are better wings, let&#039;s expand our horizons people. Who says we have to stay in Astoria? Brooklyn, Manhattan have better wings? I&#039;m willing to travel.
