				For the most part the service appears to be attentive but is really quite a mess. They try to give the illusion that they care but for the most part they could be bothered. They have had one or two good waiters/waitress&#039; but they have gone down hill since. Avoid the waiter with the wolverine sideburns at all costs. The tables are ridiculously small for the amount of things they want to put on them. If you order a bottle of wine and bottle of water prepare to balance your main course on your nose. You would think they would at least have wine stands by now since they fancy themselves as a more sophisticated restaurant. Recently they have added glass bowls the size of a small goldfish bowl to house one lone floating rose (not a great use of space to say the least, especially since there is already a candle on the table). Surprisingly, the staff is not accommodating at all.&nbsp; The ambiance is wonderful once you get past the cramped quarters and the food is OK, not great. Don&#039;t break your back trying to have dinner in the &quot;lounge&quot;. The seats are great for having a cocktail but deadly when trying to have a meal. The better choice for this place is going for drinks not dinner... <br /><br />

				I must say that I am a big fan of Locale -- it&#039;s a &quot;Manhattan-type bar&quot; in Astoria!&nbsp; I hope it gets a lot of support from the community.&nbsp; I&#039;ve always felt very welcome there and the drinks are excellent!&nbsp; The place is very cozy and inviting, and perfect for a date.

				^^ I thought that too, Jtrane.<br /><br />I personally think Locale is slightly overrated.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t go so far as to call it <em>bad</em>.&nbsp; It&#039;s good for a night out.&nbsp; And I wouldn&#039;t tell anyone to &quot;avoid&quot; it.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think small tables is really a deal-breaker.

				Sorry Jtrane, i know it&#039;s my first post but just trying to be honest.&nbsp; It&#039;s my hope that Locale will improve in those areas where they are lacking.&nbsp; I think they have gotten somewhat complacent and perhaps I just expect more from them.&nbsp; Tiny tables is not the only negative here although it is something to consider if you want to have a comfortable experience.&nbsp; In my opinion, the wait staff has gone down hill and it&#039;s not the most comfortable setting for dinner.&nbsp; Yes it&#039;s a nice place to go for drinks.&nbsp; As for the food, it&#039;s simply not consistently good in my opinion.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t say that it is bad either (and don&#039;t believe I said it was).&nbsp; They have just hyped themselves up a tad too far.&nbsp; My biggest gripe is with the uncomfortable dining experience and some of the wait staff.&nbsp; We all want to go out and unwind when we have a meal...not get agitated by the staff.&nbsp; It&#039;s just happened one too many times to me and some people that i know and I just thought it right to share my view.&nbsp; No agenda here other than that...Avoid may be a strong word but sometimes you have to use strong words to invoke change.

				I&#039;ve only been there once, this past summer. I liked the food and we did have a good<br />waiter, but my boyfriend and I totally agree about the table size - ridiculously small.<br /><br />I remember that when our food came, we had them remove the salt &amp; pepper, the bread <br />and I think even the candle on the table to make more room. And we each had side dishes<br />that came with our order that were on separate plates, which we immediately put on our<br />plates to make room.<br /><br />It would have been fine for a coffee, but the tables are way too small. To be honest, the<br />food was ok, but since it&#039;s not exactly around the corner for us to walk to, we won&#039;t go out<br />of our way to go there again. At least not till I hear they upgrade their table size. <br />

				I have never been to Locale, but I wanted to go recently for lunch on President&#039;s Day.&nbsp; I was home and hungry so I figured it was a good time to try it.&nbsp; Apparently, they don&#039;t serve lunch during the week.&nbsp; I still really want to go to Locale and try it out.<br /><br />Anyway, I suggest that you complain to the owner.&nbsp; You might get some satisfaction.&nbsp; Maybe they will buy new big tables.

				Having gone to Locale pretty consistently for the last year...the table comments-well, to me, that&#039;s really a minor issue, not even an issue. I can&#039;t even think of more than 5 restaurants in Astoria that have bigger tables. If you want a bigger table, go to Michael&#039;s, any Chinese take out place, Bistro 33 has nice big tables, but seriously table size????!!! I think the Rose thing might have been a holdover from their Valentines Day week/day; they don&#039;t usually have that.<br /><br />As for the service, we&#039;ve had different waiters, dinner and brunch service, and have never had to wait as long as we do at say &quot;Grand Cafe,&quot; at their busiest times (GC also seems way understaffed when they&#039;re busy.) When we&#039;ve been itching to go or trying to catch a movie, we can get the attention of any other service person there and they would normally get our waiter. We&#039;ve never gone there to eat when we need to leave within 1 hour, so maybe this is just different people&#039;s experience of this. In comparison, the service at Brick is the worst we&#039;ve had in Astoria on a CONSISTENT basis. From what I&#039;ve read, Mojave doesn&#039;t have a lot of good points stacked in that area, either, but I&#039;m curious to try it.<br /><br />As for food, having sampled lots of places in Astoria from diners to the more chi chi (what&#039;s that, like 2?) the food is <span class="bbc_u">really great</span> for the value. It is less expensive than a lot of other places for brunch and dinner of the same caliber in Astoria. I&#039;ve never seen Locale try to market itself as anything other than a really good new Italian/Med place. Cavo, on the other hand....<br /><br />All I can say to people who haven&#039;t gone there is, go when you&#039;re not in a rush, and make the judgment for yourself. You might be pleasantly surprised.

				I really like Locale. I&#039;ve never had a bad meal there. I particularly love thier beggar&#039;s purse pasta, with the walnuts, beets, and bleu cheese... yum. And their fried artichokes are lovely. <br /><br />I&#039;ve never really noticed the tables being all that small, but if they were it didn&#039;t distract from my experience :)<br /><br />That said, if their current wait staff is not so good, I wouldn&#039;t know as I haven&#039;t been for a few weeks.

				Yes the tables are small and yes the beverages are waaayyy overpriced.&nbsp; But this is NYC. What do you expect.&nbsp; I have only been disappointed once with the food.&nbsp; I think the food is very tasty and very good portion sizes.&nbsp; The staff has always been friendly and helpful.&nbsp; If you are clostrophopic..yes stay away..otherwise I would recommend the place.&nbsp; And if you have tried it yet, try the faggotini (beggers purse) dish.&nbsp; It is my favorite.

				I&#039;ve only been there twice, and both times the servers have been less than attentive. Not necessarily rude, just hard to come by. <br /><br />My upstairs neighbor had a terrible brunch experience there where her waiter disappeared for 20 min when she was ready to pay. Just was nowhere to be found. He finally emerged from the back and was rude to her. She talked to the manager who apparently was dismissive of the incident. She gave her tip directly to the busboy, since he was the only one who&#039;d paid any attention to her table!

				When I saw the word &quot;avoid&quot; in the subject, I figured the poster had gotten food poisoning or ground glass in his/her food. What a relief to know it was only spotty service and tiny tables that offended.<br /><br />I happen to be a fan of Locale. The pastas (including the aforementioned faggotini) are really quite good, and I usually have enough to take home for leftovers. The waiters have always been pleasant and attentive. Maybe I&#039;m just hitting the place at the right times, but on my eight or so visits, I&#039;ve never had a bad experience.

				I hear you Picasso, the only thing I expect when I dine out is to be treated well.&nbsp; I suppose the food can always be hit or miss but to expect that you should be less than comfortable at a restaurant just because it&#039;s New York doesn&#039;t make sense to me and I&#039;m a die hard New Yorker (and Astorian).&nbsp; By the way, nice suggestion by Lilithgirl.&nbsp; Never thought of just tipping the busboy.&nbsp; They certainly deserve it as they always seem to be so agitated when they bring the plates to your table and have to juggle things around for at least a hot minute till they make things fit.&nbsp; A friend of mine went to Locale a few days ago with his boyfriend and had a real messed up experience with the staff (putting it mildly)...I&#039;m not going to bother to repeat the story here...suffice it to stay that I&#039;m totally turned off by the place no matter how tasty the Faggotini or anything else is...

				Look, I don&#039;t want to argue, but I grew up around the restaurant business. <br />My father was a chef and often took me to work with him when I was young. <br />Later on I would visit him at lunchtime or sometimes come in for dinner with a friend.<br /><br />We talked a few times about good service, how to tip, what to expect, etc. And I had<br />a couple of incidents like the one described. He always said &quot;tips are earned, not expected.<br />You don&#039;t have to tip if the service doesn&#039;t warrant it.&quot; And he always told me to give the<br />the busboy (or girl!) something if they went did something for you. Like if I get my food<br />wrapped to take home, usually the busser brings it to you and I&#039;ll always give them a <br />couple of bucks. <br /><br />So if the busser is the one who doing his/her own job and that of a waiter/waitress who&#039;s <br />slacking off, then tipping them is giving them their due, not promoting stealing.

				Not tipping is not a form of theft.&nbsp; If you choose not to tip then that is your business.<br /><br />Giving the tip to the busboy with the intention of him or her keeping the tip is not theft either.&nbsp; What it is is an <span class="bbc_u">active promotion of theft</span>.&nbsp; &nbsp; All tips have to go through the waiter.&nbsp; The waiter is responsible to the house for money.&nbsp; The waiter is responsible to the other staff to tip them out as well.&nbsp; The busboy is required to give any tips which they get independently and give them to the waiter.&nbsp; <em>If they do as the patron intends, and keeps the tips for themselves, then it is a form of theft, plain and simple.</em>&nbsp; If they are dishonest and smart, they will keep part of the tip and give the rest over to the waiter.<br /><br />The service you get is part of a package.&nbsp; The waiters and bussers work as a team.&nbsp; There are times my waiter service must have sucked because my busser was dragging a$$ and I was rushing around trying to pick up their slack.&nbsp; As a waiter, I did not have the right to short my busboys on the amount I tipped them, even if I didn&#039;t think they deserved it.&nbsp; If I did, it would be considered stealing and it was a fireable offense.&nbsp; A busboy withholding tips is a fireable offense as well.<br /><br />Ladydi, I don&#039;t cafe to argue either, but your pop was in the back of the house and wasn&#039;t in the front.&nbsp; It shows an extremely poor grasp on the mechanics of a restaurant.&nbsp; As a patron, you have no idea of the real reason behind the service given to you and to promote theft like that based on un-informed presumption is disheartening.<br />

				You know, I&#039;ve worked as a line cook, bartender and bus boy, and while I understand where you&#039;re coming from, Frappe, if a customer directly gives the busser a tip and says &quot;our waitron was a real eff face, but you totally deserve this&quot; it might be a slap in the face of the waitron, but it&#039;s not promoting theft.&nbsp; I think that a situation in which a patron directly gave both the waitron and the busser an equal tip, it would be the same situation.<br />If you left the tip on the table, and motioned for the busser to just take the tip, that is promoting theft.<br />I&#039;m not saying that it&#039;s the right thing to do, but it&#039;s far from promoting theft.

				Frappe you said &quot;In some places waiters are required to tip out our bus and bar based on gross sales.&nbsp; So now if someone gives the tip to the bus it not only costs the waiter in terms of gross tips, but now the waiter has to additionally tip our the bus from their own pocket the tip which the bus got from the patron.&quot;&nbsp; Perhaps this type of tip compensation is structured to give the waiter an incentive to do the best job he/she can do.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t give good service you won&#039;t get a tip and you may (or may not) have to lose additional money as a result.&nbsp; Similarly, with your example of pooling all the tip money in a &quot;tip jar&quot; to be equally shared by the stafff...i would think this would be an incentive to each member of the staff to do the best job they can so they can maximize the amount of tip money they get at the end of the day (a team effort).&nbsp; Hopefully those members of the staff that do not pull their weight can feel the pressure of the balance of the staff and/or management and, as a result, run the risk of getting booted off the team (a/k/a getting fired).<br /><br />Quite frankly, if a member of the wait staff has done a crappy job they should not receive extra compensation by way of a tip and for any restaurant to make an employee (in this example, a busboy) feel like they were stealing because a patron insisted that they get extra compensation over the wait staff for their good service would just plain be wrong.&nbsp; I can&#039;t imagine a scenario where a busboy accepting a tip would be considered &quot;theft&quot; if it was intended by the patron that a waiter/waitress get nothing for slacking on the job.

If someone recieved poor service from the waiter, but saw the busboy did a great job and didn&#039;t want to be a total stiff, and directly tipped the busboy and said to keep it to himself, then I say no problem - this is a free country.<br />To say that someone is stealing and to go on in such an insulting and condescending fashion is beneath you.<br />At least i know if this occurs to speak to the manager and let him know.

				I&#039;ve only waitered in a diner through college, and while I haven&#039;t personally lost a tip to a bus boy (that i&#039;m aware of ofcourse), I have seen it happen, where in the little measely diner I worked in, the busboy got the tip, he immediately shared this information with the waiter, gave it to the waiter anyway. If this hadn&#039;t happened, it would have caused a problem with the dynamic of the staff. The busboys and waiters worked together, and this was one way of doing it. <br /><br />From my experience, if a waiter consistenly doesn&#039;t get tipped due to bad service, it affects the restaurant and the staff and the busboys, and it doesn&#039;t go too far before all the staff and management start complaining about it and do something about it. I don&#039;t see it so much as theft as much as just not clear on what it accomplishes to just tip the busboy, especially if it doesn&#039;t stay with the busboy, which there is no guarantee it does. <br /><br />Personally, if i&#039;m not pleased with the service, I let the management know that the particular server was a problem (like at FAtty&#039;s) and that they might be the reason I don&#039;t return. <br /><br />Not sure why everyone is getting all riled up about this though.

				I think a lot of people are getting generally irritated by the idea that they&#039;re supposed to know all policies of restaurants and payment of their employees. It seems to relate to the delivery guy thread. People who&#039;ve worked at restaurants obviously have a lot more insight into the restaurant business than others, and there seems to be this expectation from them that the average citizen learn about how restaurants work, to the intricate detail of how tips are distributed through the hierarchy of employees.

				Alexa, I guess everyone is getting all riled up over this because it has been suggested that, if you tip the busboy directly and leave no tip to the waiter then this is somehow promoting theft.&nbsp; It seems as if the majority of the group disagrees with this position. <br /><br />Personally, I do not think, as it has been suggested, that one should know the policy of the restaurant as far as the mechanics of the tip distribution is concerned.&nbsp; I think that should be the concern of the wait staff when they are seeking employment with that particular restaurant and they need to know what they are getting into.&nbsp; They are the ones that need to know how &quot;their&quot; tip is going to be distributed, if at all.&nbsp; And perhaps, the tip distribution policy of the restaurant will provide some incentive for the wait staff to do the best job they can, particulary if multiple persons are affected by the service/amount of tip.&nbsp; <br />What I personally find offensive is the notion that I, as the patron, should somehow feel responsible for the rest of the staff, assuming the restaurant has a policy whereby other staff members are to be partially compensated via the wait staff&#039;s tip.&nbsp; If I feel the bus-staff were the only ones who were attentive and provided good service then I as the patron want to make sure that person gets compensated for their good service and not the member of the wait staff that slacked off or was rude or whatever.&nbsp; I feel all of these problems could be avoided if the management trained their staff appropriately and were mindful about who they hire and the kind of service they want to provide to the community.&nbsp; &nbsp;If they want to be complacent with their staff and service then they need to be concerned, not the patron, with the possibility of a tip going directly to the busboy.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				Perhaps the waiter is no longer there if his service is so bad.&nbsp; And normally Frappes team work tipping policy is correct but in a case like this the customer is always right.&nbsp; If the customer disliked the wait service so much and acknowledged the busboy as the only representative from the establishment doing a good job then so be it. That is their right.<br /><br />And how do you know what the busboy did afterwards, especially if the customer told the manager or host what went down?&nbsp; Why assume the busboy is a thief?&nbsp; We all know wait staff that have been dishonest too so back off on that bit and be fair.&nbsp; We just do not know what the manager did.&nbsp; Sounds like the waiter sucked that night anyway.

				Restaurants are or should be geared to the patrons, not the staff.

				Ladydi, my comment was out of line.&nbsp; I shouldn&#039;t have disagreed in that fashion or tone.<br /><br />I should have said that in all the places I ever worked in and in all the places my friends have worked in and managed in, that if the tip was given to a busboy, then the busboy was obligated to give that tip directly to the waiter.&nbsp; If they did not and it was discovered, it would be considered theft and they would be fired, regardless of the thoughts or intentions of the patron.&nbsp; The convention which bounds this is as legitimate as any of the conventions which govern the rules of compensation which all jobs have.&nbsp; So while I can appreciate the comments noting that it is not the job of the patron to understand the policies of differing establishments, I can comfortably respond that the above is an unvarying constant.<br /><br />Didn&#039;t mean to drag it on longer then needed.&nbsp; I am more interested in the original discussion, as I&#039;ve been on the fence about going there.&nbsp;

				OK.<br /><br />Someone in a previous post mentioned seeing a commercial for Locale - on CNBC maybe? - and said it<br />was hysterical. I saw it last nite on MSNBC. Not that funny, but odd. They bill it Astoria&#039;s gourmet <br />establishment, worth making the trip over the bridge for. I don&#039;t think so....<br /><br />I did enjoy the food, the service was fine, just didn&#039;t like worrying that my food was going to spill onto<br />the floor or me with the tiny table situation. <br /><br />Has anyone else seen it? I think I caught it during Chris Mathews show, between 5 - 6 p.m.

				I actually like the place, been there a few times, summer or winter, not bad, didn&#039;t like much of the shrimp salad, but their chocolate martini is pretty good, i wish the place would have been a bit bigger, more roomie, since its usually packed, well, crowded whenever I go there :).<br />&nbsp;:-)

				I have to agree that the service at Locale has not been the best either time I have been there. Trying to get the server&#039;s attention was almost impossible although we were sitting at the outdoor table next to the front door and all of the waiters had to walk right past us. It kind of became a joke with our table. <br /><br />I also have the same complaint about some of the staff at Brick...<br /><br />That said - I do like the food at both restaurants and am glad that they are in the neighborhood, but wish the service was a better for what you are paying.

				Locale is good.&nbsp; Wish we had more places like it in Astoria.&nbsp; My wife and I have been dinning regularly in Astoria for the past three years, mostly &#039;cause we&#039;re too lazy to go all the way out to Manhattan for dinner, and Astoria has all of the choices we need (other than Indian food, can we get an indian food place around here? and don&#039;t say Ghandi on 30th). Last weekend we finally decided to go out for dinner on both Friday and Saturday night in the East Village.&nbsp; So of course, we can&#039;t help but compare, Manhattan to Astoria...&nbsp; Well, let me tell you I now remember what I resent about eating in Manhattan that you don&#039;t get in Astoria:&nbsp; you get half the table you get in Astoria, you get to eat sandwiched between two other couples (I mean sandwiched, like elbow to elbow with a complete stranger) and you get rushed out.&nbsp; So when I hear people say that Locale&#039;s tables are small, I have to laugh given my recent experience.&nbsp; I&#039;m sorry some people have had a bad experience, but Locale&#039;s pasta is very good, and they provide a nice ambiance.&nbsp; I will definitely go back again and again.<br />

				I was in Locale a few weeks ago and ordered the steak and fries. I ordered my steak medium and received a steak that looked super well done and looked dry (as if it had been sitting under a lamp for some time). Later, the manager (?) or someone in management came to check in to see how the meal was. I was polite and candid. His response??? It was due to the type of steak. Well, let me understand this...your chef orders tough steaks and proudly offers them on his menu?? A few minutes later, I hear him within earshot complaining about &quot;a customer&quot; who complained about her meal. Again, I kept my voice down and had been to Locale a few times. In a word - inexcusable. That was of course, my last time there. Brick Cafe, here I come. Locale, shame on you - the food was below parr and the service was &quot;meh&quot;..

				cant say I will avoid Locale...many great meals and fun times ...let your server know if you have an issue...that usually works. by the way, the owner of Locale also opened up Lucas Steak...which is top quality if you want to go that route without leaving the hood.
