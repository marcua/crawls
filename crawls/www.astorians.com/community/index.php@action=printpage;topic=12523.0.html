				Saw a 2 banners for Planetfitness on the scaffolding at the now closed Youngworld. It&#039;s on Steinway street between 30th ave and 28th ave. Across the street from the Sprint store. <br />I went to their website and they advertise a $20 a month or a $200 a year&nbsp; deal.<br />Does anyone have any opinions on what kind of gym they run? <br />At that price point this will be an interesting addition to the area against practically direct neighbor NYSC as well as evolution, lucille roberts, astoria fitness, dolphin and maybe even bqe and matrix.<br />

				According to their site a club is coming soon. I am skeptic about price, probably a down payment up front fee, like $99.&nbsp; &nbsp;Clubs never let you join on month by month basis without it, they know most people stop coming after a few workouts, so they take big chunk of money off you up front.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I went to Planet Fitness in upstate NY and it was a nice gym, and yes, insanely cheap. No tricks, though.&nbsp; I think upstate it was like $10 a month if you signed a contract, or $15 a month and maybe a $50 initiation fee if you didn&#039;t sign a contract, but without the contract, you could leave at any time.&nbsp; The gym I went to was very large and had new equipment.&nbsp; Staff was mostly high school/college kids without any real fitness knowledge, but they left you alone and you just went in there and did your thing and left.&nbsp; My only problem with the gym was that (maybe because of the low price) there were lots of useless people hanging around, spending more time socializing than working out.&nbsp; Lots of high school students, but again, this was upstate NY and the gym was located a couple of blocks from the high school.<br /><br />Basically, Planet Fitness is like the Walmart of gyms.. they are rapidly expanding, and by offering such a low price, will definitely take business away from the other gyms in the area.&nbsp; That&#039;s how they make their money--volume, and as was said above, many people pay and then never show up.&nbsp; I&#039;d say it&#039;s worth checking out if the location is convenient to you.

				I actually put a post up on the Weight Watchers message boards to see if any WW<br />members belonged to any PF branches.<br /><br />I got 3 replies - all said it was a great, no-frills gym. Clean, decent equipment, but<br />no classes, no lockers/showers. So if you just want to &#039;get in, get out&#039; I think it&#039;s good.<br /><br />Also, if they&#039;re going to really be 24/7, that&#039;s great. The other 24 places in Astoria don&#039;t<br />offer that on weekends. <br /><br />They have the Astoria club listed on their website but with a &quot;special offer coming soon&quot; banner.<br /><br /><br />

				Actually it&#039;s the same at Curves - from what I&#039;m told. They have restrooms, but no showers or locker room.<br />Guess that&#039;s considered a &#039;frill&#039; and not a necessity. It probably keeps the costs down when it comes<br />to maintenance workers. I belong to the Rock and the cleaning lady there spends a lot of time just<br />on the 3 shower stalls alone. So I guess it does keep their operating costs lower.

				Just a guess - they&#039;ll probably have a coat rack and maybe some cubbies for bags, sweats, etc.<br /><br />The Rock has that out in front for people who don&#039;t want to bother with a locker and just want a place<br />for their jacket, hat, etc. Same for the Yoga studio I go to, Om, at 12th &amp; B&#039;way. They have a coat rack and<br />cubbies for your clothes, plus a shoe rack for footwear. <br /><br /><br />

				I think I do remember that there were showers and lockers at the PF I went to.&nbsp; I never shower at the gym (that&#039;s why it&#039;s so important to get a gym close to home--you go back home to shower) and just bring a tiny pouch with my keys/ipod in it with me, so lockers aren&#039;t necessary.&nbsp; I never bring my cell phone or anything else.&nbsp; There is nothing more obnoxious than a person on the gym on their cell phone!

				Most people shower at home anyway.&nbsp; If equipment is clean, and solid/working, I&#039;m joining, if there are no giimicks.&nbsp; If I have to pay by credit card, and get billed every month, that&#039;s a gimmick.&nbsp; &nbsp; If they take cash, and it&#039;s 20 dollars a month, I&#039;m in.&nbsp;

				Hey!<br /><br />I belonged to Planet Fitness in Staten Island.&nbsp; There were both lockers and showers at that location, so I don&#039;t see why there wouldn&#039;t be any in Astoria&#039;s location.&nbsp; Also, I paid $20 per month.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t have to shell out a whole year&#039;s worth of membership up front.&nbsp; I hope that sets the record straight on all of that :)<br /><br />I&#039;m looking forward to re-joining PF now that one is opening in Astoria.&nbsp; I moved here in May and have no car.&nbsp; Anyone know what bus I should take to get to PF?&nbsp; I live near 21st Street and Ditmars.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Sandy

				Sandy, you can take the Q69 south to 30th Ave and walk to Steinway (kinda far), or take the Q69 going the other way to Steinway &amp; Ditmars and then the Q101 south to 30th Ave. Either way, you&#039;re walking or transferring from where you are.<br /><br />I am super excited about PLanet Fitness! I&#039;ve been holding out for one to open around here. All I&#039;ve ever used at gyms when I could afford them was treadmills and ellipticals. Some people hate ellipticals, I love em. Swoosh swoosh!

				Oh...I thought someone was worried about having to pay a whole year upfront.&nbsp; They do make you sign a contract, but I think the buy out is fairly cheap.&nbsp; I belonged to Planet Fitness for almost two years and I ended my agreement once I moved to Astoria.&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t charged any fees to cancel, if that helps you any.

				At sign-up, they require a credit card or bank card number, but not sure if they accept cash as well.&nbsp; They took my membership out automatically each month, but I know I missed a month once and I was able to pay them in cash for it.&nbsp; So not completely sure on their policy about cash.

				there&#039;s a pre-sale going on according to their site. with no activation fee and it&#039;s 19.99 a month (pay for the year). apparently this membership is for their &quot;Black Card&quot; which has a lot of perks too...<br /><br />http://www.planetfitness.com/AstoriaNY/?s=1287&amp;c=10297&amp;x=0<br /><br />i think i&#039;ll be pulling the trigger right now. i&#039;ve been delaying joining a gym and it&#039;s about time i just do it.

				Whats the big deal abt paying with a credit card ? u are totally protected and even if they charge u for anything u didnt authorize , you have the right to get that transaction taken off your billing with no problems . <br /><br />Its also illegal for a gym to not allow someone to quit their membership anytime the customer wants to .

				What i meant was after u pay for the entire year , which is what PF requires u to do , they can&#039;t&nbsp; charge u for the 2nd yr if u dont want them to . U have the right to quit for any reason after that . So paying with a bank card or credit card shouldnt be a problem . No worries on them having your card numbers .

				We joined Planet Fitness today, too!&nbsp; :-D We were interested in it because we&#039;re paying $75 a month at NYSC, which we find a little steep.&nbsp; We went with the &quot;Black Card&quot; membership (there&#039;s a cheaper membership, at $10 a month with no contract, but you miss out on some Black Card perks- one free guest a day, reciprocal visits at all other locations nationwide, unlimited tanning, unlimited massage chairs, whatever that is)- $19.99 a month for 12 months (paid monthly on CC, starting the first month they open, which they say will be January, though I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if it pushed back), plus a $39 annual members fee paid in June.&nbsp; What&#039;s really weird is that I expressed an interest in visiting some clubs in other parts of the country in December (there&#039;s one around the corner from my parents&#039; house in FL), and they said that would be fine, which is weird- I won&#039;t be paying until January!&nbsp; But, uh, I have the membership card, so I guess I&#039;ll give it a shot!

				So u can bring a guest every day u go to the gym as long as its the home gym at steinway ? If thats the case and the guest privlidges are unlimited (as long as u are there also)&nbsp; y not join with another person and get one membership , splitting the cost . Then always go together . Make sure the one who might go more , or is into working out more is the one whos name is on the card .

				There&#039;s nothing in the rules that lays out how they would stop you from doing that, but I can&#039;t imagine they would let that go on for too long if you actually tried.&nbsp; Memberships start at $10 a month!&nbsp; You might as well just join.

				Cash might be easier to u , but it doesnt mean its easier to them . Think abt it ,&nbsp; &nbsp;what if the owners rnt there all day and cant&nbsp; have tons of money laying around the place as new members join paying in cash .&nbsp; &nbsp;Im sure they dont want to run to the bank every&nbsp; 15 mins either . A bank card is still private , they dont have your bank account number , only your bank card number . Like i said , they cant overcharge u&nbsp; and if something ever happened your credit card would reverse the transaction right away .&nbsp; So them not accepting cash is gonna make u not join a&nbsp; gym where u can get a great price and miss out on bettering yourself and your health &gt;?

				I don&#039;t know the age of Jiggs and I don&#039;t mean this in an offensive way--but sometimes older people are set in their ways and are unwilling to try new ways of paying, such as with a credit card.&nbsp; I think of my father, who at 52 years old (not terribly old), is dead set against having his paycheck direct-deposited into his account or getting an ATM card, when clearly it would be more convenient for him.&nbsp; Instead, he has to leave work to go to a bank and cash his paycheck each week, and then he takes a lump of cash home, puts it in a little cash box for his bills, and when the bills are due, he takes his cash and drives it to the bank to deposit it into his checking account.&nbsp; I keep telling him there&#039;s a better way, but he won&#039;t listen!&nbsp; He even cut short a trip he was taking because he knew that his bills were due and that he had to get to the bank.&nbsp; There is no changing his mind, and it seems that you can&#039;t convince anyone in that mindset that using a credit card will be easier.&nbsp; Credit cards are easier, more convenient, leaves a paper trail for proof of payment, and you can dispute unauthorized charges.&nbsp; It is up to the user of the credit card to be responsible and watch their statements for unauthorized transactions, pay the bill on time, etc.&nbsp; If one could be responsible enough to bring cash to the gym to pay each month, they are certainly responsible enough to remember to pay their credit card bill.

				Jiggs i dont lift too heavy but not even a bench with a barbell ? Im kinda shocked . Also no squat&nbsp; racks either .&nbsp; Kinda weird they want to cater to only the beginers who want to do mostly cardio cuz repeat clients in the gym business are the ones who tend to be into it . The one going for the free pizza and bagels rnt gonna see too many results and probably not join again . <br />I wish the place could&nbsp; be a little&nbsp; two sided and have something for everyone .&nbsp; &nbsp;Again im not saying it needs to be a heavy weight gym but promoting bagels and having candy after a workout is pretty lame for anyone who wants to get in any kind of shape .

				The grunting , swearing and pump-up routines i agree suck to listen to . The non bodybuilding atmosphere as well as catering to the beginer is also fine . But to have no barbells at all and be called a gym does suck . How can u flat bench with no barbells at all ? Everything is on a smith machine , meaning no free range of motion.(your stronger side remains stronger and weaker side weaker.)&nbsp; They also told me when i went to visit for myself , 60lb dumbells were the max , not 80lbs. Cell phones , jeans and bandanas are banned from most gyms . Astoria sports complex is actually cheaper than $20 a month and provide pretty much everything . So not all gym are priced like the Rock on ditmars.<br />

				I currently belong to Evolution but I canceled my membership since it&#039;s a bit on the pricier side. I was wondering if anyone has been to Planet Fitness and what are your thoughts on it. For basic weights and cardio, what gym would you recommend and why?

				For basic weights and cardio i would totally recomend&nbsp; Astoria sports complex located on 38st and 35th ave , right next to pizza unos . Prices are the lowest i have seen around and it basically has everything u need as well as being pretty clean . U wont get customized towels or the latest dj spinning every weekend , but for the price which is 99dollars plus tax&nbsp; a yr the last time i checked its a no brainer if u want a decent to good gym .

				I joined about three weeks ago. I&#039;ve been there several times and here is my impression:<br /><br />1. Yes, this place is definitely no-frills. There&#039;s two levels, upstairs is cardio and free weights. The cardio section is impressive, and I mean it. Maybe it&#039;s because they&#039;re all shoved in one place, but NYSC on Steinway can&#039;t compete with this number of machines. There are easily 20+ bikes, 20+ elliptical, and 30 or maybe 40 treadmills (there may be even more of each category, I&#039;ve never really counted!) But I&#039;ve been there at their busiest time, and never had to wait (take that, NYSC!) for ANY machine Downstairs has locker rooms (with showers, lockers, and toilets/sinks) and the weight circuts. There are a ton of these as well. They also have the massage chairs and tanning booths downstairs. All is clean so far. <br /><br />2. Because the machines are new, they are clean. They have a policy of wiping down the machines when you&#039;re done (which a lot of gyms DON&#039;T do, and it skeeves me out)<br /><br />3. In the cardio room there are about 20 TVs mounted on the wall, and you can plug your headphones in to listen to them, not bad<br /><br />4. The type of people working out at this gym def. seems to be younger (sometimes there are young teens &quot;hanging out&quot; in the basement weight room, kinda bothers me, as they are taking up the machines but not working out)<br /><br />5. There are not many (or any) trainers just hanging around at this gym compared to NYSC. I believe you can schedule a group workout with a trainer but I&#039;ve never seen one actually in action<br /><br />6. There are no classes, no towels, and NO SCALE in the locker room (believe me, I looked!)<br /><br />All in all, you get what you pay for. I think for $20 a month its an excellent deal, and they make good on the &quot;unlimited guest privileges&quot; too, I have brought my boyfriend for free every time I have gone with no problems!<br /><br />

				Planet Fitness is super clean, I see people that work there go around with cleaning supplies pretty often, and I guess their job is to clean the machines regularly. There are a lot of cleaning stations in the gym so that people can wipe off their own machines, and it feels like there is usually someone there cleaning the bathrooms. It&#039;s laid back, and I have a theory about their free pizza and bagels...Since those things are unhealthy, they won&#039;t have to buy as much as if they offered, say free smoothies, or some free salad. That&#039;s just my thought. But screw it I&#039;m gonna get some free pizza and bagels when they&#039;re available.&nbsp; :evil:

				My better half and I joined PF just before New Years and have loved it.&nbsp; It gets crowded after work, but what gym doesn&#039;t, and even then we&#039;re both able to grab a treadmill or eliptical.&nbsp; It&#039;s clean, pretty low pressure, and overall an affordable, pleasant place to work out. <br />I agree with the comments about the kids who just sit on machines hanging out.&nbsp; I watched a couple hold hands and pretty much canoodle to the point that it made me uncomfortable while taking up two stationary bikes.&nbsp; I wish that the staff would say something (&quot;get a room&quot; for example), but they didn&#039;t.&nbsp; I also wish that all the weight equipment was together, and that a few additional missing pieces of equpiment were available, but when I figured out the costs it&#039;s roughly the same as ASC a year and it&#039;s much cleaner, closer to home and overall a more pleasant experience, for me at least.&nbsp; <br />I kind of treat the place like Average Joe&#039;s from dodgeball.

				I mean as far as cleanliness - It&#039;s a new facility so of course it&#039;s good. Flatscreens nice. But I didn&#039;t come to watch TV&nbsp; :-D<br /><br />I just feel trapped in there. For me to work out and continue to want to work out - which I think is important to the routine - it&#039;s too cramped. I need space and room and bright lights not bright walls to get encouraged. <br /><br />If I feel uncomfortable, it&#039;s going to drive me away. <br /><br />That&#039;s just my own opinion though. Everyone has their own take on how to go about exercising. <br /><br />Oh and yea, I&#039;ve learned to not even care or even glance at the nod, so staffers shoot away.&nbsp; :-D<br /><br />

				I have gone to this gym a few times over the last 2 weeks and it is completely over loaded with people, I had to wait over 20 minutes each time just to use any of the cardio equipment and this was late at night at after 9pm and 10pm. I think their bring a friend for free policy is for the birds, it&#039;s not fair that a paying member has to wait to use equipment because everyone brings a nonpaying friend with them and when I was at the desk in front speaking with the staff I noticed everyone who came in brought a friend, its bullsh**. My friend was going before they ran their $10 special and he said there was always a comfortable amount of people, but after the special he said it became like a zoo and joined a different gym. I&#039;ve been waiting for years for a gym to open up that was close to me and affordable and now I don&#039;t even want to go back.&nbsp; :cry:

				I haven&#039;t been there in a while.. was away all summer and last week had a nasty fever that kept me down for a while.&nbsp; I&#039;m going to check out Astoria Sports Complex tomorrow and see if it would be worth switching over.&nbsp; PF is cool and all, but I&#039;m interested in going somewhere that has freeweights other than dumbells.&nbsp; ASC is a little further away from me, but it&#039;s also a good deal and they have those freeweights I&#039;m looking for.&nbsp; PF&#039;s non-dumbell freeweights are all Smith machines.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also been focusing a good bit on running (Qns 1/2 this month, Philly full in November), and it&#039;s finally dawning on me that maybe I should perhaps throw some strength training into the mix.

				Hey everyone, I&#039;m knew to this site.<br />I stopped by the other day and it&#039;s true: only $19/month! I have friends that go to other PF located elsewhere and if you are a &quot;Black Card&quot; member you can bring a guest every time you go! I&#039;m so happy there&#039;s an alternative to overpriced NYSC.<br /><br />Check out the site:<br />http://www.planetfitness.com/AstoriaNY/
