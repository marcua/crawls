				My wife and I are considering where we may want to buy a place, and in the not too distant future raise a family. Besides the insane cost of buying a home, one reason we may move away from Astoria&nbsp; :embarrassed: and buy somewhere else is the public school district in the area.<br /><br />We don&#039;t want to pay for private schools, and wide opinion seems to be other than district 26 out east in Queens there arent many good districts in the borroughs.<br /><br />Does anyone here have children in the Astoria public schools? What is your opinion of the district? We want the best for our hypothetical imaginary babies, and don&#039;t want to send he/she to a bad school, but we also love Astoria and know that it is a good area with good families everywhere.<br /><br />Can anyone shed light on this situation- why is the area considered a &quot;Bad district&quot;? Please be honest on all pros and cons of public schools in Astoria- I am genuinely interested. Thanks!<br /><br />

				I&#039;m sure others will weigh in here (most parents are on spring break right now!) but the public schools in Astoria are very, very good.&nbsp; There are probably some that are stronger than others but for the most part Astoria has some of the best public elementary and junior high schools in the city.&nbsp; When you get to high school (and to some extent junior high) students go all over to different districts -- you wouldn&#039;t pick a place to live based on the high schools. <br /><br /><br />I don&#039;t know why you say the area is considered a &quot;bad district&quot;.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know what information you&#039;re working off of, but that&#039;s just not true.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Try looking at Insideschools.org.&nbsp; You can put in your address and find out your zoned school, and learn all about it. <br />There are also links to more information about the schools.&nbsp; You can also get information from the NYC Department of Education website, though it can be tough to navigate.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Hope this helps.

				Astoria isnt considered a bad school district and actually has some very good schools . Starting with elementary you can find some great schools at that level . PS 122 located on Ditmars and 21st is the best one and one of the best in all of Queens .&nbsp; I grew up in Astoria all my life and i know plently of teachers there and tons of my friends as well as myself went there ,&nbsp; &nbsp;PS 2 located in Upper Ditmars is also a very good school . Dont get me wrong , there are bad ones too ,but as the grades get older the schools get worse . Some of the schools at the higher aves like 36th ave&nbsp; 37th ave are really bad at all levels . LIC and Bryant the two high schools are both very bad . They were both about to be closed this past summer due to horrible grades and kids basically not showing up to school.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />If you really want great schools and even though you dont have kids yet , you seem to really have this on your mind you should maybe look in LI or the Westchester area where the schools are excellent .
