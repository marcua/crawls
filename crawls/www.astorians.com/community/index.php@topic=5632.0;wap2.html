			Okay, I&#039;m not a young and spritely fellow anymore, but I used to play roller hockey in the day and it was a fun way to keep in shape.&nbsp; I have all the gear for ice hockey, but dragging it all the way to Chelsea Piers is well, a drag.&nbsp; Anyone know of any roller hockey leagues in Astoria?&nbsp; I see people rollering around with sticks from time to time, I assume they are playing and not trying to enact some Kevin Smith movie.&nbsp; I seriously want to get back into it.

			I used to play too, but don&#039;t have any gear except skates with me.&nbsp; The only place I can see playing around here is in the park next to the Astoria Boulevard N train station.&nbsp; I see some kids there playing sometimes.&nbsp; Let me know if you find some people to play and I&#039;ll get a stick.

			I&#039;m interested if we can find a place.&nbsp; I have ice hockey gear that I lug up to Central Park in the winter time which is fun, but would love to play during the summer months as well.

			Sometimes I see people play in that pocket park on Hoyt Ave N between 21 St and Astoria Park.
