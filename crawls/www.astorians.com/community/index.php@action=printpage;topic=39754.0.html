				Actually, I&#039;ve read 2 different things in the last couple of days. <br /><br /><br />One was on DNA which stated 8 consecutive weekends, but didn&#039;t list the dates. <br /><br /><br />Then there was one item on queens.com this morning with dates. <br /><br /><br />With the way the MTA works, I&#039;ll just wait week to week to see what they&#039;re doing since they&#039;re always so well organized.<br /><br />

				JeffE ~ I can tell you in all the years I&#039;ve lived here, I never found it to be a problem.&nbsp; However, once u head up to the QBP station to take the train into Manhattan, it will be crowded.&nbsp; The bus is frequent.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Your wife is starting at QBP, so that&#039;s fine.&nbsp; No problem.&nbsp; Good luck to her&nbsp; :grin: <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />C&#039;iao for now ~

				Jeff ~ <br /><br /><br />P.S.&nbsp; sorry, so she has to get to Bklyn,yes?&nbsp; Duh.&nbsp; You did say, Bklyn half-marathon.<br /><br /><br />Like i mentioned, bus is frequent and starts early a.m.&nbsp; At that time in the morning headed to Bklyn, I would think she will have no problem getting the train to Bklyn.&nbsp; Trains should be sitting there at QBP headed towards Manhattan/Bklyn, etc.<br /><br /><br />Bus is free.

				So there should be fewer buses?<br />MTA probably picked the number of buses based on normal weekend ridership.&nbsp; Perhaps more people found alternate means of getting to their destinations than MTA predicted.<br /><br /><br />Sorry if it messed up your car ride but what did you expect?&nbsp; Less traffic on 31st?<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I gotta say today was really crazy.<br /><br /><br />Rode my bike from QP to 36 Ave and saw around 10 buses - most of them empty. <br />They must have been recommending to riders to get off at 39 Ave because the sidewalk along Northern Blvd going to QP was totally packed.<br /><br /><br />I think MTA needs to work on their capacity models a little better.

				GIVE ME A BREAK!&nbsp; What&#039;s the matter with you guys?&nbsp; Do you need instant gratification?<br /><br />The project is supposed to take all summer to complete.&nbsp; After it is done you can start declaring success or failure.<br /><br />Yes, steel wheels rolling on steel track is always going to make noise but I&#039;m sure that any reduction in noise will be welcomed by the school&#039;s staff and students.
