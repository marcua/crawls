				&nbsp;I&#039;m going on vacation for a few days, and unfortunately, I&#039;ll be gone during opposite side parking. Are there any parking lots where I can pay to leave my car for a few days, or is it easier to just park at LaGuardia?<br />Thanks!&nbsp;

				If you live need Ditmars,alternate side is only 2 days and it&#039;s not in effect this Thursday or next as far as I know(there may even be other days it&#039;s suspended).So if you&#039;re gone less than a week you should OK if you find the right spot.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t live near Ditmars,park there anyway.Even if you have to take a cab home,it&#039;s got to be cheaper than a parking lot.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				FYI:&nbsp; Parking costs at LaGuardia are outrageous.&nbsp; It would cost you around $100 to park there for a week, so you&#039;d be better off leaving your car in front of your house for the week and paying the $50 ticket, if you can&#039;t find a place.&nbsp; I believe the alt. side of the street parking ticket is $50, but someone please correct me if I&#039;m wrong.

				I believe there&#039;s a lot on 31st Street between 30th &amp; B&#039;way that has an actual attendant booth and you can park for a few days there.&nbsp; Otherwise, all I&#039;ve seen are metered lots that won&#039;t allow you to go for more than I think 10-12 hours.&nbsp; <br /><br />

If not paid within 30 days it gets interest, which can go up to $75 at least.

				Last time we went away (end of October) I parked at LaGuardia from a Wednesday afternoon to Sunday morning and it was $90. Ridiculously expensive, but we figured that we would have spent $20 each way on cabs (including tip), and if we had left the car (we have alternate side 4 days/wk) it would have cost us a $45 ticket. It was good to have our own car waiting for us when we got back, and it was pretty easy to get from our terminal to long term parking on their internal bus system (I made the miserable trek from long term to the Delta terminal on foot going because we were super late and I couldn&#039;t wait for the bus to loop around).

				I don&#039;t recall where they are, but there are some Astoria streets that don&#039;t have any ASOTS parking signs posted. Will someone here please help out and remind us where those streets are?<br /><br />Try to read these:<br />http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=4238.0<br />http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=5231.0
