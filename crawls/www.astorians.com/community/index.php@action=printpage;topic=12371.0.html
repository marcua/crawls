				I just happened upon a Craigs List ad .... apparently the owner is trying to sell the bakery. Has anyone heard anything? I have only been there once, after seeing it on the Foodista site. The pastries I had were very good. I hope that this doesn&#039;t end up another empty property on Steinway.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-(

				This is a terrible piece of neighborhood news.&nbsp; Laziza is one of the best, most unique bakeries in the city, a major distinction for Astoria.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m always amazed to talk to Astorians who haven&#039;t been there - or to Kabab Cafe.&nbsp; These are two major highlights in the neighborhood that would have pride of place no matter where they were located in NY.&nbsp; Amazing quality, character and soul.

				I would also recommend trying an assortment of things.&nbsp; Last time I was there I tried a saffron-colored pastry with some kind of cheese and it was pretty amazing.&nbsp; If the staff there hadn&#039;t urged me to check it out, I would have never picked it myself.<br /><br />Just going in there and eyeballing everything they&#039;ve got is a pretty amazing esthetic and cultural experience - soon to disappear forever, apparently.

				There is always some worry that the product will change when any business like this changes hands. Esp something so unique and special in Astoria.<br /><br />Example: I adored Josphine and her/her brother&#039;s recipes at Dolce Italia. Her business was purchased and is now Astoria Bakery 2 and IMO isn&#039;t nearly the same place.

				Thank you to all for the recommendation - I LOVED this place! I took a $10 sampler of various bite-sized baklava-esque treats, and I am very impressed. I&#039;m totally going back for whatever the hell that cake with the almond centered on top was. <br />I&#039;d love to tell what I actually got, but I have no clue. Tiny regular baklava, tiny baklava made with pistachios instead of walnuts, another pistachio related bite size thing, ... it was all yummy.&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				Finally tried it tonight, a few minibaklavas. Truly wonderful, not too sweet, great textures. The BF wasn&#039;t too impressed with the service- &quot;adequate&quot; is how he describes it- but maybe there&#039;s not much to explain? It&#039;s just walnut and pistachio baklava.
