				The wife and I went to Trattoria L&#39;incontro Friday night for dinner.&nbsp; We&#39;ve been there a few times before and it&#39;s always very good.&nbsp; It&#39;s insane how many specials they have.&nbsp; Do the waiters actually memorize the list or are they getting it read to them through their ear pieces?&nbsp; If not, what are the ear pieces for?<br /><br />Speaking of specials, I got the ostrich steak and it was phenomenal!!&nbsp; I had a few pieces left over and had them for lunch on some croutons that I&#39;d made and it was delicious, again!

				The ostrich is my absolute favourite dish there.&nbsp; It&#39;s fantastic.&nbsp; I do wish they would write their specials out, though.

				I HATE the specials list.&nbsp; It&#39;s so ridiculous that the last time I was there I just started laughing after number 5 or 6 or 17 .... there is NO WAY anyone could remember anything beyond two or three - so why do they bother?&nbsp; &nbsp;is that supposed to be charming???&nbsp;

				They must have the same specials everytime I&#39;ve been there. I think they do it so you don&#39;t know how much you have to pay for it.<br />Just a thought.
