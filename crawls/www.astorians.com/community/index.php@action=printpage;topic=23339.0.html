				He is the guy who used to sleep/stay under the Hellgate RR viaduct on 31 street by the Ditmars Blvd. station. Long beard and graying hair. 40&#039;s to early 50&#039;s?? More recently near the Sovereign Bank/Parking lot short cut on the opposite side of the street. I just saw him over there last week but not in the last 2 days. There is some sort of ad hoc memorial over there now with a bouquet of flowers, a mellon, jar of peanut butter and a rather rambling note scrawled on cardboard about essentially &quot;Here today, gone tomorrow&quot; kinda thing, but no mention of name. <br />I was wondering if it was him. There is a rather gross pile of clothing, etc right at the corner of the Sovereign Bank and the shortcut, wet from runoff from the bridge, I believe belonged to him. He had a thick eastern european accent, possibly Greek. I gave him some flannel shirts a few years back, it was winter. He said: &quot;These are YOUR possessions?&quot; I said: &quot;yes they are, and they&#039;re clean.&quot; He smiled and said: &quot;Then I will take them!&quot; Not one of those druggie/drunks from the Ditmars corner... he was afraid of them and stayed clear. I hope he&#039;s okay.

				I talked to two of the other....locals....last night.&nbsp; &nbsp;Not sure how reliable, but they told me he had a heartattack on Sunday.&nbsp; Apparently he survived but is in the hospital?&nbsp; Not sure what the scoop is exactly.<br />&nbsp;<br />He was indeed always polite and pleasant to speak with, unlike most of the people who live under the tracks.&nbsp; I hope he recovers and gets some help.

				Yes it looks like he passed away.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t see him all weekend.&nbsp; There is a sign against the wall of overpass saying &quot;RIP Chris. Astoria will miss you.&quot;<br /><br />I am calling sanitation dept tmrw morning to get rid of that unsanitary pile of his belongings.&nbsp; &nbsp;A putrid sight.&nbsp; It is a sad end.&nbsp; But he was a blight on this neighborhood for so long.&nbsp; I heard he had a family that tried to take care of him but he preferred to live on the streets; he clearly had lost his mind.&nbsp; Too bad he was beyond help.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />

				Before you call sanitation, just be sure you confirm that he is indeed dead.&nbsp; I talked to a much more reliable source tonight and was told that yes, Chris collapsed on Sunday, paramedics came and tried to revive him.&nbsp; He was taken by ambulance and this person didn&#039;t know the outcome.&nbsp; &nbsp;Odds are not good, but I would hate to rush to conclusions if there is a chance he might be back for his things.

				Yes he did die and Chris was Greek /&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had some mental problems and always wanted to fight the system . He didnt believe in paying taxes so he decided to live on the streets /&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He always had some conspiracy theory and said the Govt always brainwashed people so his calling were the streets .&nbsp; &nbsp;He was actually a smart guy , never did drugs and alot of the local stores would give him the leftovers at the end of the day .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He did have a heart attack and died later on .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I never saw him begging either but if you did offer him something he would gladly take it .

				It&#039;s always sad when a mentally ill person dies in the street.&nbsp; Bad enough to be mentally ill, but even worse to have to live that way.&nbsp; I never met this guy, but I really hope he&#039;s in a better place now.

				He really was a friendly guy. Never outwardly begged as Thanos had stated. He once asked me how I was because he hadn&#039;t seen me in a while! (I had recently moved slightly farther away so I didn&#039;t walk about 31st &amp; Ditmars like I used to. Imagine that, a homeless man being concerned for your welfare because you&#039;d dropped from sight.)<br />I&#039;ll tell you this, and it may not be very &quot;PC&quot;, but I don&#039;t care. There are several denizens of the street around that area that I absolutely would NOT miss ... Chris was not one of them.<br />I can&#039;t help but remember how he slept under a clear plastic tarp in the dead of winter, on the sidewalk, sometimes wetness around him, but never from him, and he dies in midsummer... :sad:

				It&#039;s very sad and very tragic.&nbsp; While I didn&#039;t exactly enjoy or approve of seeing him laying on the street every time I walked by, I agree that he seemed harmless and nonthreatening.&nbsp; I know it&#039;s not easy finding the best solution for someone like Chris.&nbsp; But clearly, this ended with him dying on the sidewalk or soon after.&nbsp; I would like to think that had he been forced into a city shelter, he may be alive today and might have even received necessary treatment or medication.&nbsp; But that might be unrealistic thinking by someone (me) who really knows very little about the whole shelter system.&nbsp; &nbsp; But I firmly believe that giving people in that situation money and food will do nothing to improve their situation, and may even encourage them to remain - possibly until their death.&nbsp; Unlike Chris, I don&#039;t object to paying my taxes.&nbsp; So I&#039;d like to see what I pay for go to good use, if possible.

				I&#039;d rather remember him as I saw him when we first moved here years ago.&nbsp; He was still clean and well kept, used to hang out by the coffee shop or bodega with a cup of coffee chatting with people.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t realize he was homeless for quite some time.&nbsp; Actually wondered at first if he was an undercover police officer because he was always quiet and watching and chatting with people.&nbsp; It will be very strange not to see him every day.&nbsp; I pray that he is now in a better place.

				My son and I passed him every week on our way to the library. Always smiled as we walked by, very polite. I remember back in June, when the temps were near 100 for about a week, we gave him a cold bottle of water and he was polite and grateful. Too bad.

				Wow, I saw the make shift shrine last night on my way home and realized that I have not seen him since the weekend. I thought it was ODD that he wasnt sitting at the corner under the bridge/short cut like he usually does in the morning. I asked him last week if he would be interested in some bedding, food and toiletries since I was moving in a week out of state. I told him I would find him in the last week of August to give it all to him. CRAZY. So sad. My husband tried giving him some of his boots/clothes last year and he actually said no thank you, your not my size. lol RIP.

				Fellow Astorians<br />&nbsp;<br />With a heavy heart,I have to say from a reliable source, Chris is dead.<br />A personal friend of mine for 18 years. We shared a common bond, we were homeless together.<br />For 25 years and I for 13 years. Though I got off the streets 5 years ago. Perhaps you may have seen me, I lived under the viaduct on 33 Street. So you see we were close to one another and we spent a lot of time talking when he was in the mood.<br />I&#039;ll tell you some thing about the man you didn&#039;t know.You can interpret it as fact or fiction.&nbsp; Either way it was told me and I believed him.<br />He came from a wealthy family,college educated,father was a famous Greek general and he had a wife and two kids.<br />He left home because something happened within the family. Whatever it was he wouldn&#039;t reveal to me and I didn&#039;t try to force it out of him. I too had a similiar situation and my only option was to live on the streets. So a combination of circumstance and choice.<br />On some days he acted irrational but that was to keep people away. A few might consider this as mental illness and they&#039;re partially right. When you been out here as long as we have, lack of sleep,improper diets,and danger everywhere. The mind plays tricks,hence irrational thoughts.<br />Other times we can hold an intelligent sane talk with everyone.<br />Several months ago we had coffee. &quot;Cadillac I can&#039;t make it out here another winter.&quot;<br />I know what he meant I had the same feelings over the years. I wouldn&#039;t dare tell him to go to a shelter because all street dweller know how bad they are. Too risky. We rather go to jail. Crazy? No, at least in jail you knew who your enemies were, everyone. That&#039;s why we took our chances out in the elements and picked our own places to hide. Kind people giving us food, clothing etc wasn&#039;t the reason for us staying here, we felt safe.<br />You saw the shrine, it&#039;s the street way of rememberance. A few of you left something, said a prayer or said a kind word about him to me.<br />What will happen to him? I almost forgot, he served in the military too.<br />Being that he didn&#039;t want his family notified, his body hopefully buried in a VA cemetary. Otherwise,potters field an unmarked grave.<br />That&#039;s it ladies and gentlemen. Believe what you want to about Chris the man.<br />He was my friend and I miss him.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cadillac Man

				This is really horrible.&nbsp; I have lived in Astoria for my whole life and I have seeen Chris under the train on 31st for quite a few of those years. I never saw the man bother anyone and he always seemed like a nice guy. However, I always got the impression that he didnt want to be bothered, so I never tried to speak to him. Probably about two months ago I decided to speak with him and found out that I was completely wrong. We had a nice conversation and he was more friendly than a lot people I come in contact with on a daily basis. He refused to let me buy him food or anything though no matter how hard I insisted. His reasoning was a lack of bathroom access and that being so used to NOT EATING, his stomach would get upset. His reason really just broke my heart. I was just honored and humbled by his willingless to speak to me. I know its strange but after having seen him for so many years he has become a part of Astoria and he will be missed. I wish I could have and would have done more for him. Let us all think of him the next time we pass by a homeless man or woman. We never know their struggle and a little help can go a long way.

				I&#039;d have to take Cadillac Man&#039;s word on this. He&#039;s much closer to the source, and Chris, than likely the rest of us. His &quot;Memorial/Shrine&quot; has goten a bit larger and his belongings are gone from the viaduct on 31 st Street. There is an 8 1/2 x 11 white piece of paper taped on the wall over there that states that he is alive but had a very bad heart attack. They say they are family friends and left a phone number which had the last 4 digits scribbled out... some strange people around here. :angry:

				No definitive word on anything.<br />&nbsp;<br />All signs that Chris ever existed, his belongings, memorials, printed notes and notices are gone.<br />&nbsp;<br />Looks like both sides have been swept up, nice and clean.<br />&nbsp;<br />Life on the street I&#039;d guess, I doubt this would have shocked him either.<br />&nbsp;<br />Cadillac Man had mentioned that he was a veteran and may have gone to either a VA Hospital, if he had lived; or a VA cemetery, if he had not. IF.... he was in the American Armed Services. <br />&nbsp;<br />Some how I&#039;d doubt that.<br />&nbsp;<br />And so, less than one week later, it&#039;s Goodbye.

				I used to pass Chris every morning and evening going to and from work. No matter when I passed by him though, he always looked at me just in a way like he recognized me and I would smile slightly and continue on my way. I never really spoke to him but I always worried and wanted to do something for him but I never did. That is something I will regret now that im seeing all these great things everyone has to say about him. Its a shame to see that the small memorial is gone and I think that is something we as a community should change. Just because he was homeless does not mean he will not be missed or does not deserve to be remembered. When they paint those murals some are in memory of people and I think something should be in memory of him in the place he sat everyday. Anyone agree?

				What&#039;s wrong with memorials? Don&#039;t they put memorials in a corner of the site of a deadly car accident? This wasn&#039;t a car accident, but this was the man&#039;s corner he&#039;s occupied for years. If anything, he deserves a bit of recognition. He was as much a part of Astoria as you or me. He deserves the same honor and respect.

				I didn&#039;t suggest an entire mural. If you have seen the murals I am referring to you would know some are in memory of people. What is so wrong with one in memory of him. And really what does helping mentally ill homeless people have to do with anything? This whole thread is for information or to remember a person that so many people knew of and encountered on a daily basis. How is that going too far? Like most things on the internet, if you don&#039;t like it, don&#039;t read it.

				Well Joey C, I realize this could be rambling to you, but it is a blog and you could ignore it. I spoke with Chris on and off for a good 13 years here in Astoria, gave him clothes, money... not much... a dollar or two now and then. a few years back I remember stopping and chatting with him as he stood in front of the CitiBank holding a cup of coffee. In retrospect, I think when he was on his feet, cleaned up and holding a coffee... smiling and nodding.... he was in the mood to interact with people.<br /><br /><br />A full blown memorial? Maybe not. I was thinking of a nice picture of him, smiling and looking friendly, somebody must have one.... not one of him sleeping on the ground... sorry folks, that was all I could find of him on-line. Maybe get it blown up and lacquered to the wall of the short cut where he used to be... for years. (There is plenty of other graffiti there so I doubt that it would be &#039;defacing&#039;.... hell, get a permit if necessary.)<br /><br /><br />Or, Joey, start up a fund, as you had suggested, to help the homeless somehow, a soup kitchen special meal or blankets/winter clothes, etc. In his name.<br /><br /><br />It does not have to be a full blown mural.<br /><br /><br />Cadillac Man, you were his close friend and homeless yourself, what would you suggest?

				I am not sure why my mentioning the mural has become a thing. I never said to paint an entire wall for him. Anyway I was just trying to suggest something more permanent&nbsp; in his spot.

There is an 8 1/2 x 11 white piece of paper taped on the wall over there that states that he is alive but had a very bad heart attack.

				Fellow Astorians<br />&nbsp;<br />Before I comment on the prior postings, permit me to tell you the week I had. I&#039;ll try to be brief.<br />I encountered so many of Chris so called friends saying he&#039;s alive. I asked three simple questions.<br />1) What&#039;s his last name? 2) What hospital? 3) What room? Easy questions, right? Wrong!<br />All different names, different hospitals,don&#039;t know what room. I even offered them a paid taxi ride, we will go together. No one accepted,making excuses, a few got nasty or tried to. I&#039;m the wrong person to pick on because I fight back if need be. Before I left Astoria two more different people came over and told me he was brain dead. The other,in a private hospital in Manhattan,Chris being wired with a pacemaker. I wish he was around I would ask him, to make all of this stop. Then again to catch him in a good mood.<br />&nbsp;<br />Anyways your suggestions of putting up a photo,mural, water fountain etc are heartfelt ideas but they wouldn&#039;t last very long with all the street denizens lurking about. Just a reminder, they&#039;re not homeless though portray as such.<br />&nbsp;<br />Those of you who wish to remember Chris, there are two ways.<br />1) According to street custom, you can leave a container of coffee or a cigarette at his site.<br />2) Make a donation in his name, any amount is appreciated to the Saint Francis of Assisi Breadline 135 West 31 Street N.Y.N.Y. Besides feeding the homeless all are welcome and never get turned away.<br />&nbsp;<br />At my next speaking engagement whether it be civic organization or educational institution I have lost one more street brethren to talk about. My new book when it&#039;s published he will be mentioned. You never forget the people who touched you in a fond way. RIP Chris<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cadillac Man
