				Thanks! I don&#039;t feel like it&#039;s early though... it&#039;s usually during the week before the 4th of July, no? Either way, thanks for the heads up, I love going to our private fireworks show in Astoria&nbsp; :-D

				Yes, I&#039;ve gone for the past 5 years and we always have a great time. Last year the Amtrak blew its horn as it went thru the park during the show. That was my fav.

				Kelli<br /><br />Go to it<br />This is the best show in Astoria.It does get crowded..Everyone is happy and enjoying the evening.Shore Blvd is open for you to walk on.<br />They have a band that plays on the hill on 23 Ave but right before the fireworks start make sure you are by Shore road .The trees can block the view.<br /><br />Again this is really worth going to<br /><br />Cassie

				I&#039;m doing this from my phone so I&#039;m not sure it will work.&nbsp; &nbsp; That being said, another very good place to view the &#039;works is from the pedestrian walkway of the Tribo...&nbsp; I mean RFK bridge.&nbsp; (yeah, THAT was $4 million well spent... but I&#039;m sure that&#039;s another thread)

				Ditmars festival is in full effect. Fried Oreos and all the shady game operators you can shake a stick at (including &quot;soak a bloke&quot;...where you hit the level with a ball and the clown tumbles into the water!)
