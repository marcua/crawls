			Hi Guys,<br /><br />I am new here and I posted this on the old board before it went under. In reading this thread so far, I think I have all of you beat as far as how long I&#39;ve lived in Astoria. <br /><br />I have been an Astorian for 22 years. (Since I was five years old)- cool, huh?<br /><br />Anyway, my name is Valentine and I work in a bookstore in the city and I have lived in NYC pretty much my entire life. <br /><br />I guess I joined to network with some Gay Astorians and it sounded like fun. <br /><br />I am on myspace as well under hoffsteele. Feel free to send me a message if you like anything you see.<br /><br />Take care,<br />Val

			I forget what I posted last time...<br /><br />I&#39;ve been in Astoria for about 16yrs now. I&#39;m a native New Yorker, and live with my roommate and dog. I work for a travel website, and I&#39;m always walking about town.<br />It&#39;s Sunday, I&#39;m tired, and need some tea.<br />;)

			<br />Hi!.&nbsp; New kid (?) on the block, &quot;Newell&quot; here.&nbsp; Will be moving to LIC tomorrow, 10.28.06, from Clinton Hill, Brooklyn and thought I&#39;d take this opportunity to reach out.&nbsp; Been picking up tidbits of info from this site, though I know practically nothing about the area. <br /><br />Chow for now!<br />
