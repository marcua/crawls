			<strong>AstoriaBorn</strong>:
			<br />
			Apartment buildings that stretch from 21st street to 28th Streets between 20th and 21st Ave.<br />Has anyone experienced problems with safety issues of their maintenance crew driving around in the golf carts. They drive on sidewalks and drive in opposite directions to oncoming traffic. They are not legal to drive on city streets and so they should be following traffic laws unless they want to risk having them taken away from their property management. Its for their convenience but it should not be placing the community residents in harmâ€™s way.
