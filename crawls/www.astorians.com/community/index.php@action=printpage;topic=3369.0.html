				^ah, great question - to clarify, i was referring more the supermarket/bodega route.&nbsp; i have not seen a single bar around ditmars that i&#39;d really wanna have a drink at.&nbsp; (hm, that came off a little too pretentious) - i just mean, well, we all know what the crowd is like around here, ya know?

				Although the store is notably grungy, the Trade Fair on Ditmars has the best beer selection I&#39;ve seen in the immediate area. Lots of beer from other countries, and reasonably priced. I bought some Asahi there the other day and it is quite nice. I&#39;ve bought a lot of Brooklyn Weisse there too. They only keep a few beers in the fridge, the rest are in the back corner of the store. I haven&#39;t noticed Steel Reserve, but I&#39;ll keep an eye out.

				I usually Key Food.&nbsp; They have Dog Fish Head (by my request).&nbsp; They are also receptive to getting new stuff.&nbsp; Have had success with submitting request in writing.<br /><br />Or you might just need to discover Dog Fish Head, Raison D&#39;Etre, the best beer ever.<br /><br />Also on 23rd ave and ummm 27th street?&nbsp; The bodega on that corner is well stocked.<br /><br />As for bars, Fatty&#39;s at Ditmars and 24th(?), they have a nice beer selection and some good outdoor seating.<br />Sparrow across from the beer garden (24th Ave at 29th Street) has some good beer and can be a great mellow bar (or an odd sort of outing).<br /><br />-j

				Oh AND, really really sweet beer selection at the bodega like 2 store fronts down from Omonia cafe on Broadway.&nbsp; Forget the name but lovely lovely stuff there and good prices.<br /><br />I think at one point they claimed to have 300 kinds of beer.&nbsp; Don&#39;t think it is quite that now but they&#39;ve got good stuff and a knowledgable staff.<br /><br />AND I really need to finish the whole cup of coffee in the morning before replying to posts :)<br /><br />cheers (to beers!),<br />jayme

				ah - thanks guys for those places.&nbsp; i&#39;ll check out Trade Fair&#39;s selection soon.&nbsp; I suppose you&#39;re right - Key Food isn&#39;t that bad, although with a lot of normal food items, it can be weird the way they&#39;ll carry a particular item for a few weeks, and then months go by before you see it again.&nbsp; I asked them why that was the case with Clif Bars, for example, and they said they just buy random stuff each week, odd.

				I find that Rite Aid usually has really cheap beer.&nbsp; The only down side is that you will be seen buying beer in Rite Aid.&nbsp; But, hey, you can get cash back at the register!

				Are you talking about the place next door to Omonia?&nbsp; I&#39;ve seen a lot of beers in there, but don&#39;t drink it myself.&nbsp; They seem to go out of business every few years.&nbsp; It started as El Greco, then Calista or Heliopolis, and I don&#39;t know the new name.&nbsp; Their Tzatziki has been on a steady decline, being less delicious with each new owner.

				ZiP, I feel exactly the same way about the bars around here. It&#39;s a pain. Either too young, too scary or too local.<br /><br />Seems like I have to stick with upscale, nearly empty places like that one on 30th and B&#39;way, a family-owned Greek restaurant. I like the bar at Sac&#39;s nearby, but it&#39;s small. Park Kafe on 30th Ave. and 29th St. is nice too, although expensive. Oh well!<br /><br />Oh yeah, another one not near Ditmars is that diner on Broadway.....Sanford. Only diner I know of that has Belgian beer!&nbsp; :lol:<br /><br />For buying beer, I got a kick-ass bottle of Leffe at the Othello Deli on 24th Ave. near 28th St. or so. Rally&#39;s on 23rd Ave. (near House of Sudz) also has a nice selection of Beligan/German beer. Key Food on 31st has some larger bottles. <br /><br />Great, now I&#39;m thirsty........ :roll:
