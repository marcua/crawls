				I haven&#039;t seen the columns of light they turn on as a tribute for 9/11 before and I&#039;d like to take some pictures.&nbsp; It seems that a good place would be between the Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges on the Brooklyn side of the river.&nbsp; It looks like there&#039;s a park there - I have never been there before.<br /><br />I&#039;d like to go there on Thursday, however I have to work until 9pm that night.&nbsp; Can anyone tell me about the area?&nbsp; Is it a safe (well-lit, people around) area at night?&nbsp; What&#039;s the best way to get there from Astoria (near 46th st GRV stop) at that time of night?&nbsp; I see there&#039;s about 3 subway stops near the park, but not sure the quickest way to get there - would taxi be faster and not super-expensive?&nbsp;

				&quot;Tribute in Light&quot; will be lit on September 11, 2008 beginning at sunset.&nbsp; The Mahattan Bridge is situated in a rather crazy place, what with Chinatown right there, so I wouldn&#039;t recommend going there. <br />I would suggest that you go to either the Brooklyn Bridge or Battery Park.&nbsp; As long as you&#039;re not wandering around late you should be alright. Just use your judgement.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />For Battery Park you could take the &quot;W&quot; train to Whitehall St/South Ferry.&nbsp; <br /><br /><strong>NYC Subway Map (http://www.mta.info/nyct/maps/submap.htm)</strong>

				You&#039;re referring to &quot;The Cove between the Bridges&quot; (Brooklyn and Manhattan).&nbsp; This is situated in the DUMBO section of Brooklyn.&nbsp; &quot;The Cove&quot; is part of &quot;Brooklyn Bridge Park&quot;.&nbsp; I use to live in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn and would frequently photograph the skyline from this vantage point, sometimes at 1:00 in the morning.&nbsp; You&#039;ll be fine. No sweat. Would be sort of interesting if you could capture the waterfall, the bridge and the two beams of light in the distance. <br /><br />You could also go to Pier 1, located on the southern side of the Brooklyn Bridge.&nbsp; <br /><br /><b>Brooklyn Bridge Park (http://www.brooklynbridgepark.org)</b>

				turned out to be a great spot, lots of other photographers there.&nbsp; getting there was easy too - transferred to the F and went to York st.<br /><br />(http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3133/2849575835_cb318a1f0f.jpg)<br /><br />the rest of the set can be seen at http://www.flickr.com/photos/jasonslogic/sets/72157607243297003/ (http://www.flickr.com/photos/jasonslogic/sets/72157607243297003/)<br />

				I prefer the vertical one (http://www.flickr.com/photos/jasonslogic/2850411186/). And I like the blue against the orangey city lights :) I do kind of wish that the little &quot;spots&quot; in the clouds were there in the vertical one though - like the way the light hit the clouds on the one you posted in this thread - in the vertical one, the cloud spots would probably be about halfway up.
