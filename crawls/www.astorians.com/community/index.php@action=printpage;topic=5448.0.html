				Just spent some time filing my taxes, *first time ever e-filing online*.&nbsp; Was mostly painless except for the self-employment element.&nbsp; I used TaxACT, which was free for my federal taxes, and only $12.95 for my state taxes (taxactonline.com).&nbsp; Such a better deal than TurboTax online, which will hit you with unassuming costs if you are not careful (It would have cost me about $40 to file both fed and state last year, when they promoted themselves as &quot;free&quot;.).&nbsp; I thought $12.95 was a fine amount to file NYS taxes, as I find the NYS tax form to be particularly ornery (at least compared to CA, which can be as easy to fill out as falling off a log).&nbsp; <br /><br />However, TaxACT had so many screens encouraging you to upgrade to their paid version!&nbsp; I guess I shouldn&#039;t be surprised, but they were pretty into the hard sell, as much as can be online.&nbsp; Easy enough to get past those screens, though.<br /><br />So glad I got this done!&nbsp; Whew.

				Perhaps when I&#039;m making more money, it would be something I could consider.&nbsp; But with the money I make, it is a better choice to do it on my own.&nbsp; My meager earnings are simple and I have no property/investments/deductions beyond the standard.&nbsp; I won&#039;t go into my situation in detail, but doing taxes myself makes the most sense for my financial situation.<br /><br />That&#039;s great that an accountant suits your needs.

				If you own a home, or are self-employed, or have investments, or have kids, maybe.

				I agree with Harlan.&nbsp; For us single, renting, and what not... e-Filing is pretty convenient.&nbsp; They also really outline it out for you, so you can find ways to get more back as well.<br /><br />I have compared my results using TaxSlayer.com and HRBlock online.&nbsp; HRBlock has definitely made my refund go up which is good.&nbsp; Thanks Meg for the info about TaxACT, I am going to check that out and compare.&nbsp; That&#039;s another good thing about online stuff, you can compare before committing to one company.

				I do my taxes online every year because I own nothing (no kids, cars, property, etc) so it&#039;s easy.&nbsp; I wish I&#039;d known that about TaxACT.&nbsp; I did the whole thing for &quot;free&quot; with TurboTax and then it wasn&#039;t free but I was so damn relieved to be done with it that I just paid the $15 to get it overwith.&nbsp; But I felt robbed.&nbsp; And for some reason, TurboTax never saves my info from one year to the next, which is annoying.&nbsp; Next year, maybe.<br /><br />I have a random tax question: I have a friend who hasn&#039;t paid his taxes in 5 years.&nbsp; This year, he wants to be square and pay up.&nbsp; I&#039;ve offered to help him (against my better judgment). I know there are penalties for paying late but I&#039;m having trouble finding information about specifics. Most of the information I can find online is for current filings.&nbsp; Does anyone have an idea of where I can look?&nbsp; <br />

				I feel for your friend MagicPie.&nbsp; Good luck to him - the IRS can be ruthlessly abusive.&nbsp; Has he received any pieces of mail asking about his owing back taxes?&nbsp; I recommend starting with a phone number that might be on the letter/documents.&nbsp; That&#039;s the most direct way.&nbsp; For back taxes, it&#039;s really best to talk to someone directly.&nbsp; Online is good for downloading tax forms and such that the person at the IRS instructs him to.&nbsp; <br /><br />Good luck to your friend again, MagicPie.

				I downloaded all of the forms for all of the previous years online.&nbsp; Those were easy to find.&nbsp; It&#039;s the SUPER late taxes advice that I can&#039;t find.&nbsp; He&#039;s never gotten any mail from the IRS asking for the back taxes -- which is why he was able to avoid it for so long.&nbsp; (That, and the laziness.)&nbsp; I think I&#039;ll call the 800# for the IRS tomorrow.&nbsp; I&#039;m just afraid they won&#039;t believe it&#039;s not for me and I&#039;ll get audited or something.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				WHOA! I am not a lawyer or an accountant and I have never been delinquent in filing my taxes, but I wouldn&#039;t make that phone call for anyone. They are going to ask you questions about your friend, and then they have the right to ask you questions about yourself!<br /><br />The first step in untangling a past due income tax mess is picking up the phone and calling the IRS. They&#039;ll want such personal identifying information as your name, address and social security number—as well as information about your employer and current salary—before they&#039;ll discuss your delinquent tax returns with you.<br /><br />The IRS will want you to commit to a definite time by which you&#039;ll promise to file all delinquent returns. If you find you’re having trouble meeting this deadline because it&#039;s taking longer than you thought to get your paperwork together, it&#039;s best to call the IRS ahead of time to request an extension.<br /><br />When you establish a deadline for filing your returns, you&#039;ll want to get &quot;account summaries&quot; from the IRS detailing:<br />• What returns have already been filed (either by you or by the IRS)<br />• What taxes are currently owing<br />• Whether refunds due to you have been applied to delinquent taxes<br /><br />You can then file tax returns for each year you&#039;re required to file, based on your most accurate estimation of your income, deductions and filing status for each year. If you don&#039;t have pay stubs or W-2 forms detailing your income for years past, you may be able to reconstruct what you earned based on old checkbook registers or other similar documentation.<br /><br />Any refund you would have been eligible for won&#039;t be refunded to you or credited against amounts you may owe more than three years after the date the return for that year was due.<br /><br />The IRS can&#039;t assess penalties higher than 25 percent of the tax due for a particular year. But interest adds up quickly, especially for taxes several years overdue.<br /><br />Once you&#039;ve filed all your returns, the IRS can tell you how much tax you owe, and the exact amount of penalties and interest. At that point, you can set up a payment plan or discuss an offer of compromise with the IRS.<br /><br />If your friend knows they owe money it might just be a good idea to seek the services of a tax attorney. They know how to negotiate with the IRS and might be able to eliminate most of the penalties and interest. <br /><br />Hey, they got into this mess by themselves, they should be responsible for getting out of it by themselves!<br /><br />Have your friend read <span class="bbc_u">this</span> (http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=108327,00.html) very carefully!<br /><br />If your friend knows that they might have refunds due, have them read <span class="bbc_u">this</span> (http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=168422,00.html).

				Wow, that is really helpful.&nbsp; Thank you so much.&nbsp; That first article was really helpful, as was all of your information.&nbsp; I think he has a dream that he will have a huge return once this is all done but I don&#039;t think so.&nbsp; Luckily, it&#039;s just a pile of W-2&#039;s so I don&#039;t think it will be too difficult.&nbsp; What a mess.&nbsp; I feel guilty for being happy it&#039;s not me.
