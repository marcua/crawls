				Are there any other shut-ins in Astoria who play 1 vs 100? We&#039;re Ninja Zephr&nbsp; if anyone is interested in teaming up, especially when they come out of beta?

				It&#039;s pretty cool actually. A little like pub quiz minus the socializing and the beer *unless your apartment is fully stocked*. I think they are coming out of Beta soon so you can actually win stuff.

				It&#039;s really fun, especially if you have a group of 4 to chat with/compete/play with during the game.&nbsp; The questions get pretty tough too.<br /><br />- Andrea (the other half of ninja zephr on xbox live)
