Michael Gianaris (D-Queens) said Tuesday.<br /><br />The cameras, paid for with $1.7 million in state and federal funds, will be installed at the Broadway, 30th Avenue and Astoria Boulevard stops along the N/W line. Each station will be outfitted with 12 cameras, most of them positioned at the entrances and exits.<br /><br />Rep. Anthony Weiner (D-Queens/Brooklyn), who worked with Gianaris to secure funding for the cameras, said a 2003 al-Qaida plot to release poisonous gas in the subways shows how vulnerable the system is.<br /><br />But Gene Russianoff, staff attorney for the Straphangers Campaign, said he isn&#039;t convinced adding a few dozen cameras will improve safety. But, he added, &quot;It&#039;s like chicken soup, it can&#039;t hurt.&quot;<br /><br />Besides, he added, &quot;A lot of riders find solace in seeing these cameras and it makes them feel more secure.&quot;<br /><br />There are 50 subway stations in the city that have surveillance cameras an MTA spokesman said.<br /><br />However, a spokeswoman for Gianaris said that these will be among the first in Queens. She said the cameras will be similar to those installed in convenience stores, and will be able to store 45 days worth of information.<br /><br />They should be operational by the end of the summer, she said.<br /><br />A year ago Gianaris announced funding for cameras at the Ditmars Boulevard station; they have been installed and should be operational in two months.<br /><br />He also hopes to secure money to install cameras at the Steinway Street station along the R line.<br /><br />Gianaris also hopes to secure money to install cameras at the Steinway Street station along the R line.<br /><br />&quot;We are now in a period of record-breaking train usage in the city,&quot; Gianaris said. &quot;The more we can make people feel safe in getting on those trains the better it&#039;ll be for them and for all of New York.&quot;<br /><br />Weiner insists, however, that the security cameras will not be used as a substitute for police vigilance, but more as a tool in deterring crime.<br /><br />&quot;You can&#039;t have too many eyes keeping us safe when it comes to the subways,&quot; Weiner said. <br /><br /><br />

				Despite my generally libertarian views in other ways, I really don&#039;t have a problem with this, assuming the cameras are not hidden and aren&#039;t being streamed to the Internet or anything. I&#039;m not sure why I&#039;m not offended by public cameras, but subway platforms are public spaces, and just as I can legally photograph people on the subway platform, the cops can videotape me.

				With some of the recent attacks over the last two years in subways, especially the very brutal gay bashing at 36th Avenue, I think this is a good thing.&nbsp; I understand people&#039;s fears of surveillance and it being &quot;big brother&quot;, but I know I&#039;ll feel a bit safer knowing the cameras are there, especially if they&#039;re visible and people know they&#039;re being taped.

				Yes and maybe they can put a surveillance camera in that area where fellow Astorians.com member Beedee was robbed by a bunch of kids! <br /><br />If used as a crime prevention tool, I&#039;m all for it! &nbsp;Unfortunately, the NYPD doesn&#039;t have a good track record when it comes to videotaping:<br /><br />http://www.gothamist.com/2007/03/25/the_nypd_loves.php<br />

				I agree with McDirk in that it will be good to have some sort of surveillance to prevent muggings and other crimes from happening at the stations. <br /><br />&nbsp;If you are not doing anything wrong- then you&#039;ve got nothing to hide. Just my opinion.

If individuals know that they are being watched at the stations then perhaps they will be less likely to commit their crimes. If it cuts down on the number of muggings, rapes or other crimes then the cameras have served their purpose.

				Just to put this out there...<br /><br />Cameras may make people <em>feel</em> that they are safe but I question how effective they will be in actually preventing crime given that all you have to do is pull a hood over your head to conceal your identity.<br /><br />The most likely benefit of cameras is the help they provide in gathering evidence to capture and prosecute criminals -- but this is after the fact and only if the police decide to pursue a case.<br /><br />My main concern is less a fear of a &#039;Big Brother&#039; effect than of the MTA cutting staff and the Police reducing the number of patrols in stations and and relying solely on the cameras for security. The pledge now may be that the cameras will be used in a supplementary capacity but how long will that last?<br /><br />There&#039;s a real danger in being lulled into a false sense of security, by both the public and the authorities -- though I doubt that could happen on the NYC subway anytime soon<br /><br />And are the powers that be really billing this measure as &#039;anti-terrorist cameras&#039;? What a joke. I wouldn&#039;t think that someone who&#039;s intent on committing a terrorist act in the subway would stop and reconsider because there&#039;s a cctv camera in a station. Look at the London, the most surveilled city in the world, yet CCTV cameras did nothing to prevnet the tube bombings in 2005. <br /><br />

As long as it&#039;s only used for shooting criminals, you say? That&#039;s what worries me. Once the guns become commonplace, what is there to stop them from being used in a non-benevolent manner?&quot; <br /><br />Are there occasional shootings that shouldn&#039;t have happened? Yes, but not very often at all, given the number of cops on the street with weapons. And there&#039;s rules, and oversight, and honest-to-goodness human decency that prevents them from being abused. Same with cameras on subway platforms.<br /><br />Cameras in my apartment (without a court order due to probable cause) would be inherently bad. Cameras in public places, like cops with guns, are not inherently bad.<br /><br />And Newtownian, care to flesh out your argument a little?<br />

But the cameras aren&#039;t going to have face-recognition software that&#039;s going to update some database every time you use the subway. They&#039;ll either be like the security cameras at 7-11, which are only reviewed if there&#039;s an incident, or they&#039;ll be like the security cameras in buildings, which are viewed in real-time by off-duty cops, but only reviewed thereafter if there&#039;s an incident. You&#039;re making stuff up here.

Technology has won the battle and it&#039;s something everyone has to incorporate into their everyday lives. <br /><br />The government, or pretty much anyone else for that matter, is already tracking (or can) where you go and what you buy and you&#039;d shouldn&#039;t be too surprised about how much what you buy says about you as a person.<br /><br />Everytime you use your metrocard, EZpass, credit card, atm card, go online, etc. you are tracked, and many businesses, including most bars and restaurants do have cameras.<br /><br />If you think about it, if you walk down Steinway from 28th Avenue to 34th Avenue I&#039;d bet that with the invasion of the neighborhood by retail banks you&#039;d be photographed almost the entire distance -- this is done by private landlords or businesses -- and is perfectly legal. Does it make it worse if a government agency sets up cameras? <br /><br />The problem seems to me is not how the information is collected or the information itself but how it&#039;s used and that&#039;s what must be protected.<br /><br /><br /><br />....and I still think spending <strong>1.7 million dollars</strong> for cameras at <strong>only three</strong> subway stops is a mega-waste of money.<br /><br />

				Bring &#039;em on. I wear a fake moustache, sun glasses and a hat any time I leave my apartment. Just kidding. But, perhaps I should...?<br /><br />My upstairs neighbor, Ken, in my last apartment in Manhattan was murdered in his living room. There were no signs of forced-entry to either the building or his apartment. There are no security cameras in the building&#039;s lobby. I would like to believe that, had there been and had the killer seen a camera and/or a sign advertising said camera, Ken might still be alive today. I can imagine that surveilance cameras that are well advertised are MUCH more effective than sneaky, hidden cameras at preventing crime. Preventing terrorism, I&#039;m not so sure about since terrorists the likes of the 9/11 gang aren&#039;t planning on being around afterward in order to worry about being ID&#039;d. Just MHO.&nbsp; :-(
