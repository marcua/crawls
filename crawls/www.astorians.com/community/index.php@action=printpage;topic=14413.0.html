				http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/25/opinion/25desantis.html?_r=1<br /><br />I was wondering why Liddy stays on at AIG. He wasn&#039;t there for the meltdown, and is being paid $1 per year. He has to sit in front of crooks and charlatans while they question his integrity. Seems like the worst job in the world.<br /><br />This opinion piece, in my opinion, is brilliant. I especially like the part of donating to charity instead of giving it to the government.

				In the past, high level compensation at AIG would be for millions not including salary. - See their Proxy.<br />Worth more if the stock would gain.<br /><br />The letter highlights in part that at a company 99 out of 100 employees may be bringing a profit. But there is a great danger if 1 out of 100 could bring losses wiping out all profits.<br /><br /><br />My hope is that more companies would soon be able to return money back to the Feds.<br />Private companies should be diligent when considering compensation. And I wish more would have Say on Pay for shareholders, even if not binding.<br /><br /><br />

				This op-ed is also a great defense of property rights, at least in subtext.&nbsp; At the point congress starts messing with contracts (whether they like the contracts or not), what other overreaches will they engineer?&nbsp; And by what right can they take away compensation paid to foreign nationals?&nbsp; 50 some odd percent of the AIG bonuses went to people who do not work or live in the U.S.&nbsp; I&#039;m really glad that this guy took this silly notion of &quot;publicly shaming&quot; people who were paid due compensation.<br /><br />Of course, if the Employee Free Choice Act passes, congress will essentially control the work rules for all American businesses anyhow.&nbsp; So I guess this is all moot.

				If you want to be depressed, read the comments section in response to this thing at the Huffington Post: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/03/25/aig-resignation-letter-in_n_178892.html<br /><br />For the record, I used to read comments sections on conservative news sites to get depressed while Bush was president. I had to convince myself that these people were all either professional interference runners or something like the Upright Citizens Brigade:<br />&quot;<em>Our only enemy is the status quo. Our only friend is chaos.</em>&quot;
