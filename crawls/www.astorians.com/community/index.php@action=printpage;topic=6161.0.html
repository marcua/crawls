				<strong>Tillman Comrade Says He Was Told To Conceal Truth</strong><br /><br />http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18293583/ (http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18293583/)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">WASHINGTON, D.C. - Pat Tillman&#039;s brother accused the military Tuesday of &quot;intentional falsehoods&quot; and &quot;deliberate and careful misrepresentations&quot; in portraying the football star&#039;s death in Afghanistan as the result of heroic engagement with the enemy instead of friendly fire. <br /><br />Tillman, a San Jose native, left the NFL to join the Army after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. His mother still lives in San Jose. <br /><br />&quot;We believe this narrative was intended to deceive the family but more importantly the American public,&quot; Kevin Tillman told ahearing of the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee. &quot;Pat&#039;s death was clearly the result of fratricide,&quot; he said.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Three years ago I was shocked to hear that Pat Tillman&#039;s &quot;hero death&quot; was a cover up, and that he was killed by fratricide. What I cannot still understand is why they had burned and destroyed his gear, and why the Pentagon continues to resist to tell the facts. Why did the Tillman family have to go through all this and demand an oversight committee hearing yo get to the bottom of what actually transpired? There is some talk that the Tillmans suspect Pat may not have been killed accidentally. <br />
