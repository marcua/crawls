				Looking for fellow creative types interested in going to the park and painting/drawing on the weekend. (Or sketching in a friendly bar or coffee shop on rainy days).<br /><br />Tell me what days work for you, what your medium is, etc., and if there&#039;s enough interest, I&#039;ll schedule something.

				Well I can make this Saturday, weather permitting and if not I&#039;m up for any other location. I work in television so my hours are wacky during the week, so sometimes I&#039;m available during the week as well. Magicpie, we can always catch you another weekend but I&#039;d say the more the merrier.<br /><br />You can usually catch me at DerekAEdwards@gmail.com. I always need a reason to get out of the apartment and draw.<br />

				Hey Enigma,<br /><br />thanks for the links. I&#039;m currently checking out the Artists League which sounds like a really good deal. Just to give you a heads up, I&#039;m free this weekend, although it is memorial day weekend and most people might have other plans, but if you want to find some other place to hunker down and draw I&#039;m game. Anyone else? <br />Let me know. Either way, if it&#039;s nice on say Saturday or Sunday you might find me at the park.<br />
