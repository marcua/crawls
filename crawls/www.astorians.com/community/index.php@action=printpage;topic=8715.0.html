				I am moving from Astoria to Park Slope and can only cancel if I&#039;m 30+ miles away (which obviously, I&#039;m not). So I&#039;m trying to pass it on to someone else! <br /><br />The Rock (http://www.therockhealthandfitness.com/) is a really great gym, they have TVs on every single piece of cardio equipment, offer lots of really great classes (including the usual Yoga and Pilates, but also stuff like Belly Dancing, Capoeira and Dance Fusion), unlimited access to a Boxing studio (classes also offered), unlimited access to an indoor Rock Climbing wall, free childcare while you work out (they even keep a camera in the room so while you&#039;re working out you can monitor your kid), discounted rates on nutritionists and trainers, is always clean and has a really friendly staff. They are constantly adding new equipment and upgrading. They are also open 24 hours during the week, and open at 7am on Saturdays and Sundays (close at 12am Friday, 11pm Saturday and 10pm Sunday). <br /><br />The joining fee has already been paid by me, and I am more than willing to pay the $75 transfer fee to someone interested in the membership. The cost is $83 monthly, you can pay it in cash before the 20th of the month, or have it withdrawn from your bank account. If you are a student, or work in certain stores/schools in Astoria, or are part of the NYPD you can get a discount on the membership. <br /><br />Membership includes unlimited access to all equipment and classes, and also gives you a %10-%15 discount to many of the stores in the neighborhood. Also, when I joined I was given one free nutrition consultation as well as a free training session, but never used either. I assume they would be transferred with the membership. The membership will be good until May 22nd of 2008. <br /><br />If you&#039;re interested, email me @ mrs.golia@gmail.com!

				I know FDNY employees also receive the discount off membership, but I don&#039;t recall any other city employees. Teachers, possibly - unfortunately I have all the information packed for the move. Discounts are also on a few of the little bakery&#039;s and restaurants as well as the Olympia vitamin place that&#039;s across the street. Again, the list is packed away. I tried to find out more info from the website but I didn&#039;t find what I wanted. I will try to get another sheet when I&#039;m there tomorrow morning, if you&#039;re interested.
