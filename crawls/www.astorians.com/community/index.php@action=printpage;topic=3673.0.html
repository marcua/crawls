				i&#39;m shopping for a new salon that does waxing. up until about five minutes ago i went to &quot;REJUVE&quot; which is on 23 street by the pastry place that&#39;s being renovated. the first time i went there the young woman who waxed my legs was AMAZING and it was $25; when i went back to get a bikini wax it was an equally pleasant experience and i believe it cost $30.<br /><br />i went back yesterday to get my legs done again and the woman who did it this time had no clue what she was doing. i sat through a painfully hot wax done by someone without any experience and i was charged $40 dollars. i called them this morning and spoke to the woman who waxed me and complained she gave me an appointment for five. i went in today at five and was rewaxed, the woman who did it did a mediocre job and i was only given $5 dollars back. <br /><br />i was tired of complaining so i just went home with my poopie wax and five dollars in hand.<br /><br />while i have been recommending rejuve to everyone i know i take this time to formally take back my recommendation- the quality of the service has gone done hill, quick. i must say i&#39;m very disappointed.<br /><br />i am looking for a new place to get waxing. it does not have to be in astoria but it does have to be good. any leads?<br />

				For a year I&#39;ve been searching for someone who knows what they are doing when it comes to waxing, esp. my eyebrows, and after many painful and embarrassing experiences (having half of my eyebrow threaded off) I found the best and I will never go anywhere else. Check out Robin Evans Skincare in Soho, easy commute N/W to Prince. They are experts in hair removal, shaping, tinting, etc. All they do there is hair removal and facials. A little more expensive but WELL worth it! My eyebrows have never looked better and I am a customer for life now! They are really nice, not snobby, and the hours are very accomodating. www.robinevansskincare.com&nbsp; Good luck!

				For anyone who&#39;s tried the home waxing kits (microwave wax from Nair or something) does professional waxing feel about the same or do they use stuff to make it hurt less?

				it&#39;s swifter than waxing at home so therefore is supposed to be less painful. That said, you want to make sure you go somewhere professional that monitors the temperature of the wax so they don&#39;t burn you.

				i find i can stand to self wax it&#39;s just the back of my legs that give me trouble. growing up i used to tweeze my pit hair (yes i&#39;m one of those freaks) and was never bothered by it. but bikini waxing myself is not something i think i could ever do.<br /><br />as for waxing my eyebrows i prefer to get them threaded. i read somewhere that waxing pulls on the skin and causes it to lose resilience and wrinkle faster!
