				My boyfriend and I have a one bedroom available for sublet in a 2 (technically 3) bedroom apartment located in the Ditmars area (27th Street and 23rd Ave). It is a great area (only 5 minute walk to the subway AND you get a seat in the morning&nbsp; :-)), near a bunch of restaurants, laundromats, and supermarkets, etc. The rent is $830/month, with a $415 security deposit. Utilities are separate ($33 for cable/internet, gas/electric is about $50/month- or less). The room is available starting December 1st (or earlier if necessary), and we would like a commitment through May 31st, and at that time you can decide whether you would like to sign on to the lease or continue on a month by month basis.<br /><br />The apartment is fully furnished except for the room for rent. The room itself is about 9.5 x 11 feet with a large closet, and a large skylight. The room can easily fit a queen sized bed, bureau and nightstand. The room/apartment is in great condition, and has wood floors, new appliances, and a large balcony with a grill for BBQs. We also have a small office that we would all share and that we also use as a guest room.<br /><br />A little bit about your potential roommates: we are a professional couple in our mid-20s, friendly, clean, and responsible. We are looking for a roommate who is a working professional, responsible, friendly, clean, and chill and who pays their rent on time. If this sounds like a good fit, send me a PM with more info about yourself to see if we can set up a time for you to see the apartment.<br /><br />Good luck with your search!
