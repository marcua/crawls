				In the spirit of &quot;whats up with the train today&quot; I thought I&#039;d start a thread about everyone&#039;s worst, or best, train ride ever.&nbsp; Here&#039;s mine;<br /><br />Back when I was still on the R at Steinway I was taking the train to my job at the time in the meatpacking district.&nbsp; As the train was pulling into the Lex station we stopped, just at the edge of the station entrance.&nbsp; And we waited.&nbsp; And waited somemore.&nbsp; The conductor made an announcement that we were stopped because of debris on the tracks.&nbsp; Then some more waiting.&nbsp; Then the conductor made another announcement that we had actually run over someone, and would be exiting through the first door of the first car, which was the only door actually in the station.&nbsp; So everyone, surprising cow I thought, made their way out the train and up and off the platform, which had been closed down.&nbsp; I had to leave the station and do some walking to get to a working train that would get me somewhat back on route to work.&nbsp; Here&#039;s the funny part, I eventually ended up waiting on the A/C/E platform at 42nd street when there was a station annoucement that went &quot;Due to a SICK PASSENGER at the 59th St &amp; Lexington station, there is no R or N service at this station&quot;.&nbsp; I thought to myself, &quot;Self, yeah they&#039;re sick... sick of having a train on top of them&quot;

				Oh I got to get on this too again.<br />Although relatively these days, it was not so bad.<br /><br />Early on while living in NY, we were hoping and praying that the trains would get us to work. (Different train lines, different boroughs)<br /><br />The train was being held in the station. Why, because of a police incident.<br />OK.<br />But we never expected to see people running around with their guns drawn.<br /><br />I started to get a better sense of NY, when one passenger said <br />&#039;Just shoot the criminals already, we need to get to work&#039;.<br /><br />No shots were fired. We were late. Life went on.

				Worst for me, by far, was getting stuck underneath the East River between 59th Street and QB Plaza on the N train for what seemed to be well over an hour. &nbsp;It was almost fourteen years ago now, so the time may be a bit exaggerated. &nbsp;It was around midnight and I was coming home from a party or bar, or something, I&#039;m not quite sure anymore! &nbsp;I do remember the next day was Good Friday because I didn&#039;t have to go to work and I decided to go out on the rare weekday! &nbsp;<br /><br />What made it the absolute worst, though, was that some crazy person kept on screaming at the conductor, god, and the MTA to get the train moving! &nbsp;He slammed on the seat, paced the car, pounded on the doors and at one point, I thought he was going to into a violent rage against some poor random passenger. &nbsp;Since there were only five of us in the car, my odds of being the that individual were pretty good!

				This is largely OT, but it involves a train ride.<br />And if any of you were participating, my apologies, again.<br /><br />Some people need to handle the being sick on the train ride better, when possible.<br />I have seen terrible episodes that did not delay us 1 second.<br /><br />One time, sad to say, the sick person was me.<br />I swear I was feeling fine. Very excited.&nbsp; :lol:<br /><br />But I really wanted a seat. And then, I thought I said I was going to sit down, which was strange because I was nowhere near a seat.&nbsp; :roll:<br /><br />Next thing I know (before we made a single stop), I wake up next to the door. Whatever I was drinking (non-alcoholic) is all out of my tummy (stomach for all you doctors) and in puddles around me.&nbsp; :yuck:<br /><br />Not sure what the reactions were. But people were generally cool in the wonderful NY sort of way. <br />Again, I thought I was feeling great again. But I promptly went straight back home.&nbsp; :lol:<br />Did not cause a single delay&nbsp; &nbsp;:mrgreen:&nbsp; , other than cleanup on train 6.<br />Sorry about that, MTA.<br />&nbsp;:oops:<br /><br />

				One time a friend of mine fainted on the train - she was the &quot;sick passenger&quot;. Poor gal.<br /><br />As for my worst-ride-ever (as these seem to be accident/bodily-harm themed), one morning on the way to work, I was on the F train (my Brooklyn days) in 42nd street station I think. I didn&#039;t see what happened because I had a seat, but the people standing near the door while we were in the station sorta gasped at a commotion on the platform. The doors closed and we started to pull out of the station, and the people near the window started screaming. Someone pulled the emergency brake and we stopped.<br /><br />Turned out someone had &quot;pushed&quot; someone into the space between the cars, but as there were accordian-like rails there, they didn&#039;t fall in, but had gotten their arm stuck in it somehow, and we had begun to DRAG them. I think they were okay as I don&#039;t recall there being a large paramedic presence involved, but we sat there for a while in the car and all the ladies around me started to cry. It was totally traumatizing.<br /><br />My favorite part of the story, though, was when all was said and done and someone had to come down and re-set the emergency brake. A train official-type person comes into the car and finds the pulled brake and says, &quot;Who pulled this brake?&quot; and a guy standing nearby says, &quot;I did.&quot; MTA guys asks &quot;Why&#039;d you do that?&quot; and guy says, &quot;Um, because the train was dragging someone??&quot; Everyone in the car rolls their eyes. What kind of question is that? I just wanted to hit that MTA guy.<br /><br />Anyway, I still look at those style trains and think about that guy. Sorta freaks me out - I&#039;m glad I never actually saw what happened, as hearing about it was bad enough.
