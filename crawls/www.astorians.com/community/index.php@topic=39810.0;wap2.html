			Dance at the Voelker Orth Museum and Garden<br />&nbsp;presents<br />Valerie Green/Dance Entropy<br />&nbsp;In<br />&nbsp;Impermanent Landscape<br />Sunday, August 20th at 2pm<br />&nbsp;Voelker Orth Museum<br />&nbsp;149-19 38th Avenue<br />&nbsp;Flushing, NY 11354<br /> <br />&nbsp;Impermanent Landscape, choreographed by Valerie Green, is a contemporary dance performance in the round. The dance features the geometry and architecture of overlapping bodies, inspired by the ideas of perception, impermanence, and the shifting landscapes of NYC. Masterfully performed, with a sonic landscape composed by Martyn Axe, it has been adapted for the Museum&#039;s garden setting.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;The hour-long performance is Dance Entropy&#039;s second appearance at the Museum. Impermanent Landscape premiered at Danspace in June. The performance actively engages its audience in ways that are delightful to audiences new to contemporary dance and those who follow it with a passion.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;FREE, Suggested donation: $5<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Impermanent Landscape is supported, in part, by public funds from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs in partnership with the City Council and The Mertz Gilmore Foundation Late-Stage Production Stipend.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;About the Company:<br />&nbsp;Valerie Green a Queens-based artist, formed Valerie Green/Dance Entropy in 1998, and founded GREEN SPACE, the company&#039;s permanent home in Long Island City in 2005.
