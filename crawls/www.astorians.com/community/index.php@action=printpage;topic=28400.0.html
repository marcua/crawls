				What the hell does &quot;t<span style="font-family: verdana;" class="bbc_font">he revitalization of Ditmars blvd.&quot; mean? Ditmars has been the main commercial strip (along with 30th and Broadway) of the neighborhood for decades. It&#039;s not a place that needs, or has needed revitalization in a long time.</span>

				Philo hit the nail on the head, just for assuming we are that stupid and wouldn&#039;t realize it, I&#039;ll never set foot in the place. For the record, yeah, its just what Astoria needs,another cafe that will be filled with obnoxious eurotrash and block the sidewalks as people try to get by. I hope they fail miserably

				The look/name of this place always really stick out to me when I walk by, and not in a good way. Sort of dated, early 90s-but-still-thinking-it&#039;s super-cool in a way that&#039;s kind of embarrassing. Like a flashy older guy I once went out with.<br /><br /><br />Of course, I doubt I am in the target market for this place, being a washed-up old broad with kids.&nbsp; And well, look at places like Flo (inspiration for the name?) which seem to pack &#039;em in despite so-so food and high prices. The whole brunch in a place that looks/sounds/feels like a night club is something I never experienced before I moved to Astoria. It&#039;s funny. I still kinda hope Ditmars maintains its quiet alternative-to-30th-Ave vibe despite this supposed &#039;revitalizing&#039;...

				To me it sounds like there is too much judging in this thread (and even forum) if it&#039;s not your thing, keep on walking. <br /><br />Instead of knocking a local business, we should encourage it and hope it does well. Whoever is opening it I&#039;m sure is putting up a lot of money and perhaps sweat into making it succeed, would you rather have an empty storefront?<br /><br />For those that don&#039;t enjoy the &quot;bro&quot; crowd, how do you think they look at the joints that host big beards? <br /><br />I&#039;m an old fart with a kid, so I don&#039;t care either way about any place and I like to give every new business a try, unless it&#039;s too expensive for me.<br /><br />Everyone is different, live and let live and always wish your fellow human being the best, imo.<br />

				The only reason we might start to see more empty storefronts is precisely BECAUSE of new business like Tru.&nbsp; They are attracting a new demographic to the area which in turn affects residential and commercial rents, which then drives out the mom and pop businesses.&nbsp; <br /><br />There should be a place for old AND new school businesses.&nbsp; I happen to like both types,&nbsp; but my fear is that...with the way things are progressing...that there&#039;s going to be less and less room for the old school.<br /><br />Take Brooklyn Bagel for e.g.&nbsp; Yeah, I like a good bagel like everybody else but lines out the door on the weekends?&nbsp; For what?&nbsp; They&#039;re not THAT special.&nbsp; And just a few blocks away is the oh-so-charming old school Bagel House...with perfectly good bagels.&nbsp; But no one goes there...cuz it&#039;s not as &#039;cool&#039;.&nbsp; Which is precisely why I prefer to patronize Bagel House.&nbsp; I really value the old school version of Astoria...if I wanted all hipster stuff I would have chosen to live in Wburg.&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp; For me it&#039;s crucial that I&nbsp; support the old school places...otherwise I&#039;d be a hypocrite to then lament them as they close down, one by one....<br /><br />

				The prices where a little inflated I mean I paid $12 for the house burger. It wasn&#039;t all that. A Wendys burger is a million times better. So the more complex food cost more. I expected it to be loud like Avenue, but no if they had music is very low. I did not have to shout to talk to my friend. Now weekends I don&#039;t know could be a different story.

				Almost all major businesses in Astoria are greek owned . So catering to a europen crowd isn&#039;t so abnormal.&nbsp; The music will be techno , house , electronica , house and some greek .&nbsp; &nbsp;Places like Central cavo&nbsp; Tru&nbsp; Grand Athens café(obviously) Martha&#039;s bakery Agnanti Kyklades&nbsp; MP taverna,&nbsp; tons of other food places , bars, lounges and cafes&nbsp; are gonna have a certain vibe to them .&nbsp; If u complain u&nbsp; don&#039;t like it or feel you don&#039;t fit , then simply don&#039;t go .&nbsp; If you want to try them out with an open mind , then go for it .&nbsp; Nothing like a nice summer night sitting outdoors sipping an ice coffee .&nbsp; People here are so negative to new places that open up&nbsp; ,&nbsp; and it really makes no sense to me . If u like&nbsp; the idea , go for it ,&nbsp; &nbsp;if you don&#039;t&nbsp; , then stay home .

				We made it over to Tru last Friday evening and really enjoyed it.&nbsp; It&#039;s definitely a mini-Avenue Café in every way except it&#039;s definitely toned down a notch.&nbsp; No ridiculously sexy, overdressed hostess.&nbsp; No pounding music at high volumes.&nbsp; Actually really down to earth and very friendly service.&nbsp; The décor is obviously the same designer as Avenue Café but I don&#039;t mind it.&nbsp; The grilled halloumi was delicious as were the zucchini fritters.&nbsp; My wife had pork chops that she really enjoyed.&nbsp; My chicken kebob was delicious.&nbsp; The rice was a bit bland but the portions are generous.&nbsp; Cocktails were made just right and service was swift and they showed a lot of concern that we were pleased with everything.&nbsp; We had delicious coffee drinks but things took a turn for the worse with the desserts.&nbsp; The cheesecake was - honestly - disgusting.&nbsp; Some ladies next to us got the brownies.&nbsp; They looked so rich and delicious so I asked them what they thought.&nbsp; They all made a face and said they were horrible.&nbsp; Obviously they need to work on this.&nbsp; Why bother trying to do something you&#039;re not good at when you can get delicious desserts from Artopolis or even Martha&#039;s and keep it local?&nbsp; It looks like they do a very good breakfast and brunch.&nbsp; From the crowd, it would seem as though the Ditmars area was dying for this kind of café.&nbsp; It is incredibly popular already.&nbsp; It can understand it being jarring for Ditmars at first, but I think they&#039;re trying to make it work without being over-the-top.&nbsp; I will be back for sure.&nbsp; It was an enjoyable time and nice to have that experience on Ditmars.&nbsp; By the time we left at close to 9:30, there was not an open seat in the place.

				I walked past Tru around 9:30 Saturday night and they had fairly loud music playing from the outside speakers. Ok, during the summer if the door/windows were open and it was part of the interior sound - fine. When it&#039;s cold out and everything is sealed up, I see zero reason to play music outdoors to try to draw people in. Even if it isn&#039;t ridiculously loud, I would be so angry to be a neighbor with the constant noise. A very 30th ave thing to do, not Ditmars.

				I agree.&nbsp; When I was there the music was quite mild, actually.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think that kind of music pumped out into the street matches with the character of Ditmars at all.&nbsp; I would hope the management realizes that they can maintain a certain look and feel without going off the deep end.

				I passed by Tru on Sunday afternoon and had no idea by it&#039;s design or lack of menu up front what type of eatery it is so I kept on walking. Do they really expect people to walk in out of curiosity and ask an employee what they are supposed to be?<br /><br />There were a few other establishment on Ditmars with the same set up.

				I wouldn&#039;t say EVERYTHING is overpriced.. looks like a few things are appropriate for the area and &#039;style&#039; of the place and other things are upper end for the fancy stuff. I perused and found an oddity- The hand cut fries as a side during breakfast is $3... but for lunch and dinner they&#039;re $5.. <br /><br /><br />Brunch prices aren&#039;t ridiculous, actually- but the drinks might be a bit off kilter compared to the other reasonable pricing. So the unlimited 2 hour thing for $15 is a bargain. 2 drinks and it&#039;s already paid off. So it just says how much the margin is on alcohol at ANY bar.
