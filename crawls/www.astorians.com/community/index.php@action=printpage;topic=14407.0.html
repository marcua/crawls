				Aside from &quot;not making my child cry,&quot; what else do you have to take into consideration before deciding on a pediatric dentist? <br /><br />Dentists Burbank (http://www.DENTALBURBANK.COM)

				You have to take into consideration how fast they work (as you know kids dont like to sit still for long) and how well they distract your child. Dr. Janco is amazingly efficient and good with the kids. I cant recommend her higher.<br /><br />

I would also avail myself and my child to a no-fee consultation. Without any of the above being exemplary, I would continue my search.

				Wow...and I thought the child not crying was enough. Actually, I forgot the attention span of a child is short. (silly me) I heard that there are dentists who give the children toys to play with while they are waiting and they allow them to play with the toy with the condition that they(the children) behave while having the dental work done. I am trying to call a couple of dentsits recommended by some mother&#039;s in the neighborhood, and they are quite difficult to get in touch with.

				Dr Janco is awsome. She&#039;s been there for years. The chair might be old but you cant beat her experience in the treatment of babies. Lovely lady. 42-09 21st Ave (718) 545-5302 . highly recommend her.
