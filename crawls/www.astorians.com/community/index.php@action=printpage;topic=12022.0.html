				I tried that place once and I hated it.&nbsp; The food seemed like it had been sitting out there for a long time, and the space itself was frayed and timeworn.<br /><br />Presumably some people like it since it seems to have been there for a while, but I don&#039;t expect I&#039;ll go back.

				I think the place used to have a different name, and presumably different owners.&nbsp; I was only there once, at least 6 years ago.&nbsp; They had a great seafood buffet, but they didn&#039;t give me anything to open the crab legs with.&nbsp; When I asked the waiter about that he seemed to indicate that they didn&#039;t have anything.&nbsp; What????&nbsp; Maybe he was indicating that he didn&#039;t speak English and couldn&#039;t be bothered.&nbsp; I always wanted to go back and see if they still had great seafood.&nbsp; (I think it was only served starting in the evening, Friday through Sunday.)

				They change owner a couple times, the food was good before they change owners. A most recent experience I had was around 4:00pm,<br />the food was awful. I understand thats the time food is change before it goes bad but I got the brunt of not so good food. I don&#039;t like to <br />spread this type of news but wanted to find out if anyone had similar experiences&nbsp; &nbsp;:-o

				I went about 6 months ago, and the food was awful.&nbsp; Nothing was fresh, everything was made with the cheapest possible ingredients, and it was all oversalted.&nbsp; I took a plateful of food and ate very little and regreted what I did.

				It&#039;s a buffet.&nbsp; Which means that anyone can touch it, cough on it, and possibly spread their feces on it.&nbsp; Which is what a homeless man in Times Square did in a deli that had an open buffet a couple years ago.&nbsp; Ever since that story, I&#039;ve sworn off buffets forever.&nbsp; There also really aren&#039;t any good Chinese restaurants in Astoria, so taking both that fact and that it&#039;s a buffet, and that means that this place has got to be horrible.

You cannot take one bad experience whole different level. Places like Time Square, the deli are huge no one to really keep an eye out for everyone that comes into contact with the food.

				Different strokes for different folks.&nbsp; Personally, I hate buffets.&nbsp; It really isn&#039;t just the Times Square story, I&#039;ve seen disgusting things go on at most buffets, including ones in restaurants.&nbsp; People are gross.&nbsp; It&#039;s just not my thing.&nbsp; And I have yet to have decent Chinese food in Astoria.&nbsp; &nbsp;But it&#039;s just my opinion, buffets are popular in lots of places, so obviously people like them.

				Well went to the china buffet on Ditmars today for the baby shower.&nbsp; The food was better than I expected <br />especially after all the negative comments I read here.&nbsp; It was fresh and hot, they kept refilling with fresh as soon as something ran out.&nbsp; Everyone enjoyed the food and had a great time.<br />There was 1 server a girl who when you spoke to her kept saying ok ok ok lol dont think she really understood what was being said to her, 1 of the guys had to tell her but its ok.<br />The owner Kevin is very nice and made sure everything was all set up he evenhad his staff help us set up the decorations.<br /><br />
