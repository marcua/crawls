				&nbsp;I just got back from the site of the 9/11 attack in NYC. The site where thousands of Americans and others lost their lives after being attacked by barbarians from the 12th Century , who traveled from their lands thousands of miles away, lived among us, ate and drank with us and then killed us. I was here that bright, shining morning, in sharp contrast to today, which was raining and cooler. The site has now changed, building has progressed, but, six people I knew are gone forever. My childhood friend &#039;Benny&#039;, was on the 82nd Floor of Tower 2, I saw him the saturday before and he was to pass by in the evening, where I was to be working, at the election site that was on that day in 2001. A lot of ugly things have been said since that day, about that day, and about those who are fighting this war, but, one fact remains, those buildings were bought down by an enemy, still out there, an enemy of civilization. Now, what are you and I gonna do about it?<br /><br />I find&nbsp; people&nbsp; who preach&nbsp; &#039;Peace&#039; while&nbsp; &#039;wearing&nbsp; pictures&nbsp; of&nbsp; chairman Mao&#039;, to be extremely disingenuous, and&nbsp; at this&nbsp; point , to be , whether&nbsp; they know it or not, siding and&nbsp; helping the enemy. <br /><br />It&nbsp; amazes&nbsp; me that any&nbsp; woman or&nbsp; gay&nbsp; or lesbian person, would&nbsp; not&nbsp; want to fight&nbsp; these 12 century&nbsp; barbarians?&nbsp; I don&#039;t get&nbsp; it?&nbsp; Instead&nbsp; many so-called&nbsp; &#039;Peace&#039; people&nbsp; put all their&nbsp; energy&nbsp; in shutting down the war&nbsp; against&nbsp; these insane&nbsp; people. <br /><br />Let&nbsp; the negative&nbsp; nods&nbsp; from the usual&nbsp; gang here&nbsp; begin. :roll:

				Hey, FZ, even though we may not agree about the path to peace, I&#039;m sorry about your six friends.&nbsp; I watched the whole service today and it was very moving.&nbsp; Hope your time there this morning was helpful.

				I too am very sorry for your loss FZ - and the loss of many others.<br /><br />I think that some just feel that perhaps there&#039;s more to be gained by society for us to figure out how to prevent stuff like this from happening again in the future. Part of that can be finding those who brought about the events of 9/11, but the discussion needs to go a lot deeper than that. It&#039;s not just gays, women, and lesbians who are interested in peace - there are many (even those who directly lost family on 9/11) who are interested in peace.<br /><br />If I may post a question back to you; do you support justice at any cost? <br /><br />I&#039;m not against bringing criminals to justice, but unfortunately a lot of innocent people often die in the process - which, ironically is what those barbarians thought they were doing that day - bringing &quot;justice&quot; to the United States. They would argue that we invaded their land first (military bases), lived among them, and brought death to them. I&#039;m not saying they are right, but there&#039;s a certain circular logic here.<br /><br />What I observe is that this kind of justice (the retributive kind) only creates more death in its wake. I want those who live after me to not have to pay for the vengeance I&#039;d exact today.<br /><br />For this reason I find the dialog of peace an acceptable alternative. Not always, but mostly.

So, why is Osama Bin Laden and his merry band of fundamentalists still alive and taunting us with video and audio tapes 6 years after the fact? And why has our attention been diverted to Iraq who had nothing to do with the attacks of that day? And why have almost 4,000 of our military been sacrificed on a boguis threat? And why does every mention of 9/11 by the Bush administration still mention Saddam Hussein and Iraq in the same breath? Why are we still buying this propaganda?<br /><br />I&#039;ve also knew several people who perished on that horrific day at the WTC, and like everybody else I was 100% behind the promise that was made to us that we will get Osama and eliminate Al Qaeda. Why are we not any closer today than we were 6 years ago? I&#039;m outraged too, but at the extremist thugs who attacked us, not at an entire group of people.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure I understand the reference made regarding women, gays and lesbians.

				Because the war on Iraq has nothing to do with terrorists. It began long ago and is about economics. 9/11 was merely a convenient excuse to create a sense of patriotism and a culture of fear that would get citizens to support the &quot;war on terrorism&quot; that was really a &quot;war for $$$.&quot; <br /><br />How do you think we should respond to a cult of extremists, by bombing entire cities full of innocent people? And you wonder why terrorists- from these same countries that don&#039;t have much of a defense system in place- hate us so much? <br /><br />It was pure David vs. Goliath. While I am deeply sorry for your loss, imagine if you were a citizen of a small country with few weapons and it was America that killed your friends/family for oil or revenge. You&#039;d be siding with the terrorists most likely. I can see their point of view.

				FZ, I&#039;m really sorry for your loss.&nbsp; And I&#039;m honestly not trying to be an asshole here, but...<br /><br />If you support the war so fervently, and are so frustrated by the &quot;peace&quot; people, why don&#039;t you enlist and go fight?&nbsp; If you support the current military action that is being taken, you can take the burden off an over-extended soldier by sacrificing for a principle you seem to so strongly support and join the army.<br /><br />I just get frustrated by people who so casually can support a war they are unwilling to fight in themselves.&nbsp; If you&#039;ve already done military service, then you can obviously ignore this statement.

				It&#039;s easy to cherry-pick examples of people dancing in the street when the towers fell.&nbsp; Falwell essentially did the same thing when he blamed homosexuals and &quot;immoral&quot; people for the attacks and essentially saying the US deserved it.<br /><br />Yeah, I remember the images of people dancing in the street, but I also remember images in Arab and Persian communities lamenting the attacks as well and voicing their outrage and sadness that people would use their religion as justification for mass murder.<br /><br />Anyone can make a case based on the images portrayed on the &quot;news.&quot;

				I&#039;ll give you that some do want to unite the world under their banner, but that would wash out with those in this country that want to extend their beliefs (democracy) all over the world as well.<br /><br />How is it determined that certain practices are inherently wrong? &nbsp;I think that&#039;s very egocentric. &nbsp;As reprehensible as you may think certain practices are, other cultures find ours just as reprehensible.<br /><br />As for civil liberties, we are definately on that road. &nbsp;A nazi officer would pop a chubby if he knew how much information is accessible to the police on its citizens. &nbsp;All in the name of safety. &nbsp;Cameras being installed (which do not reduce crime at all), random bag checks on the subways (which do not reduce the threat of terrorism at all), laws which allow our government to see which books you are checking out from the library?!<br /><br />As for our gov&#039;t being more guilty, I do not hold that.&nbsp; I just see any power broker swimming in the same seas and any action is not the action of an insane leader, but a cold, calculated manuver.&nbsp; I do not require any apologies from any side on such.&nbsp; I just see the danger in writing them off as extremists.

				(first off, neat discussion. &nbsp;may not agree but I think its great to chat like this!)<br /><br />What is the inherent superiority of democratic government? &nbsp;Why is it superior to other forms?<br /><br />Cultural practicies began for a reason. &nbsp;Female genitiallia mutilation sprang out of a certain belief system. &nbsp;I never thought belief systems or religions were subject to popularity contests. &nbsp;As for genocide, I&#039;m not sure most instances could be considered a cultural trait. The only instance I can recall was the periennial &quot;war&quot; which the spartans declared on the helots. &nbsp;Every year, they would declare war and butcher the helots which they considered problematic.<br /><br />Yes the collection of information itself is not <span class="bbc_u">always</span> an infringement of civili liberties, however, it would be a tired point to make to point out how easily that can be used to violate them.&nbsp; What happened at the Republican National Convention was disgusting.&nbsp; If the same happened in China, our media would have jumped all over it.&nbsp; <br /><br />The United States is very generous in times of need. &nbsp;But it is never motivated by alturism, rather by strictly machiavellian motives.

				Comparing Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Dresden, Viet Nam -- to 911 ? They were all in the course of war! BTW in WW2 - we didn&#039;t get involved in until after we were attacked at Pearl Harbor.<br />To compare actions in a war - to an attack like 911 at a time of peace - attacking &nbsp;innocent civilian is rediculous. <br />BTW - I&#039;m against the war in Iraq - think Bush is an imbecile who can&#039;t speak proper english but that doesn&#039;t make me think that mourning the victims is over doing it, or families don&#039;t deserve settlements.<br /><br />I notice here also that everyone lists every reason on earth why the Muslim world hates the US but one - Israel. That IMHO is the most important reason that we are hated - our support for this small independent democracy of jews - surrounded by Arab countries - large in number on all sides. &nbsp;They haven&#039;t gotten over that they lost the war &nbsp;and refuse to make peace. They do &nbsp;not recognize Israel&#039;s right to exist and they want to kill every Jew.<br /><br />Does this sound like something in recent past history ? Is this what you support ? &nbsp;They also want to kill all christians. How do you like the Islamic oppression of women ? Don&#039;t even ask about they gays.<br /><br />If you are raped in these countries and report it - they find you guilty of infedility and stone the woman to death. In Pakistan a man was found to have dishonor to the family - so they gang bang raped his sister for vengeance. <br />Mind you these are not the extremists -- these are regular example of how their laws and culture is enforced. The extremists obviously go further with suicide bombings (using women and little children) &nbsp;terrorism and acts of war like 911.<br /><br />We may disagree about the road to peace, but don&#039;t defile the 911 victims. Also we, and I mean we as a country ought to examine the real issues here and not skirt around them.<br /><br />

				I said it in the &quot;9/11 memorials&quot; post, and I&#039;ve said it before that post.&nbsp; And I will say it here again.&nbsp; The 9/11 &quot;Truth&quot; movement, &quot;Loose Change&quot; and other similar entities are all a bunch of bunk.&nbsp; Whatever the motive of the attackers on 9/11, we were attacked by an outside force.&nbsp; Elements within our own government DID NOT plan and execute 9/11.&nbsp; To keep spreading such claims pollutes the national discourse.&nbsp; We have real, pressing issues to discuss, and do not need to be wasting time refuting the B.S. of the &quot;truther&quot; movement.&nbsp; For a fairly good refutation of the claims espoused in &quot;Loose Change&quot; and by other elements of the &quot;Truth&quot; movement, see Popular Science.&nbsp; Or, see the wikipedia entry, which has plenty of links to debunking sources.

				Hiroshima, Dresden, My Lai, 9/11, et cetera, are all acts of aggression in which the military objective was not paramount concern.&nbsp; They were all designed to break the will of the people using terror.&nbsp; Noting that such were &quot;acts of war&quot; is really saying &quot;acts of war as defined by the west&quot;.&nbsp; Since the west excels in conventional warfare, we ethnocentrically limit the definition of war to such:&nbsp; that war is strictly a declared action by a recognized government against another recognized government is a western invention.&nbsp; Using ethnocentrism to justify one action and denounce another, though all are equally barbarous, is a narrow approach.<br /><br />Why should the arab nations recognize Israel&#039;s right to exist?&nbsp; Arguments can be made in both directions, but with just knowing a little bit of an unbiased history, its not a self-evident answer.<br /><br />Islamic treatment of women and gays is not our concern.&nbsp; Since when did we earn the right to tell a religion or state how to operate?&nbsp; What are you saying about islam?&nbsp; Are we to contain it, change it or destroy it?<br /><br />Agreed on the conspiracy theories.&nbsp; As much as I love a good one (Capricorn II) I think part of it stems from America&#039;s inability that someone from outside outmanuvered us in such fashion.

				For all you who cite examples from history where the U.S. and it’s allies – or the European powers and their ally the U.S. (it’s not like we invented warfare) may have acted “questionably” I have two words: grow up.<br /><br />It’s war. What do you think happens during war? Two soldiers shake hands and then take turns shooting at each other until one or both are dead? The bodies are picked up and everyone goes home for dinner?<br /><br />We’ve all grown up with this myth, derived mainly from WWII propaganda I think, that somehow war can be clean, all soliders honorable, that civilians somehow can be avoided in the middle of a battlefield. That war is somehow fought only ‘strategically’ and ordinary citizens are never targeted. Since when? In what war did this happen?<br /><br />The firebombing of Dresden, for example, was a terrible chapter in WWII and European history but it was the British, not the United States, who targeted the city and dropped most of the bombs. Was it a strategic decision to do so or payback for the Blitz? Was it any worse than the German firebombing and destruction of Coventry in England? what would have made it fair -- if the Brits dropped the same number of bombs as the Germans and then stopped? Revenge is a powerful emotion and like it or not plays a role in life and during peace and during wartime. <br /><br /><br /><br />And for all of you who propagate silly stories about what “really” happened on 9/11. I’m sorry but it’s my opinion — and I’ll take the hit on this — <strong>that it is you who are the real danger</strong>, not anti-war protestors who speak their conscience. Because what you’re doing is using real events that affected real people for fun and entertainment purposes. <br /><br /><br />

				If there was a real conspiracy regarding 9/11, it would be the media&#039;s lack of investigation and questioning what would drive almost 20 people to be willing to kill themselves by flying airplanes into buildings?&nbsp; What would cause them to hate us so much to be willing to do that.&nbsp; And it&#039;s not because &quot;they hate our freedom.&quot;&nbsp; There are long rooted historical reasons that need to be explored.&nbsp; And by doing so, then we can start dealing with the real reasons we are in conflict with so much of the Middle East and addressing ways to actually resolve it.<br /><br />It&#039;s not as simple as &quot;good vs. evil&quot; and anyone who thinks that is living in a fairytale.&nbsp; To me, that&#039;s what is so infuriating about this current administration, and all potential future presidents on the stump right now.&nbsp; Talking points to represent the most simple, non-nuanced position to sell to the lowest common denominator of American voters.&nbsp; Sometimes, you have to swallow a little pride and admit mistakes to pave the way for future progress.&nbsp; The cowboy mentality is only going to continue to alienate the rest of the world and isolate the US.

The point is always to kill and terrorize civilians. That’s what makes it so horrible. <br /><br />I may be making an assumption here but it seems to me that you’re almost making the point that Americans deserve to be killed because of actions of their government. I find this ridiculous.<br /><br />I’m not going to argue the point but I’ll agree with you that flying airplanes into office buildings is a legitimate act of war and that’s why we went to Afghanistan – to retaliate against an act of war.<br /><br />Why the airplanes were flown into the buildings is still open to debate and will not be resolved anytime soon but I don’t accept it was done solely because of anything specifically done by the U.S. <br /><br />I put forth this argument – The destruction of the WTC had less to do with attacking the United States than it did to prove who is the stronger power in a civil world that’s engulfing a large portion of the Muslim world in the Middle East and south Asia. What better way to impress one’s enemies then to take on a greater power?<br />

				Oh I certainly do not think that American&#039;s deserve to get killed due to actions of their government.&nbsp; I think as a matter of course, the actions of a government shall sometimes result in the deaths of its citizens.<br /><br />Cruel and barbaric?

				The reason for this attack is the same as pretty much any reason these Islamic extremists do what they do. religion. <br /><br />And one of the main reasons we are stuck with Bush in the White House, and have engaged in this nonsensical war (that is not really fighting terrorism) is also religion. No surprise. Religion is at the heart of many conflicts. It&#039;s the great divider. <br /><br />Also, you can&#039;t over do &quot;peace.&quot; We have not even acheived maintaining peace amongst our own people.

From 9/11 to Columbine to the sexual assult at Ditmars, understanding what causes these attacks and these devestating behaviors is, in my belief, the key to preventing them.

Part of that can be finding those who brought about the events of 9/11, but the discussion needs to go a lot deeper than that. It&#039;s not just gays, women, and lesbians who are interested in peace - there are many (even those who directly lost family on 9/11) who are interested in peace.<br /><br />If I may post a question back to you; do you support justice at any cost? <br /><br />I&#039;m not against bringing criminals to justice, but unfortunately a lot of innocent people often die in the process - which, ironically is what those barbarians thought they were doing that day - bringing &quot;justice&quot; to the United States. They would argue that we invaded their land first (military bases), lived among them, and brought death to them. I&#039;m not saying they are right, but there&#039;s a certain circular logic here.<br /><br />What I observe is that this kind of justice (the retributive kind) only creates more death in its wake. I want those who live after me to not have to pay for the vengeance I&#039;d exact today.<br /><br />For this reason I find the dialog of peace an acceptable alternative. Not always, but mostly.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thank you, and&nbsp; I respect&nbsp; your&nbsp; views.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am interested&nbsp; in &quot;peace&quot;, but, not every&nbsp; situation can be resolved&nbsp; &#039;peacefully.&#039; The people&nbsp; we are fighting are not interested&nbsp; in &#039;peace&#039;, sadly.<br />There&nbsp; idea&nbsp; of peace&nbsp; in conversion to their&nbsp; religion and way of life or death, not peaceful&nbsp; co-existence. <br /><br />Justice&nbsp; often has a&nbsp; high cost, even at the expense&nbsp; of innocents. There is&nbsp; no moral&nbsp; eqivalence&nbsp; of&nbsp; agreements&nbsp; between states, who can be held liable, to roving bands&nbsp; of&nbsp; groups&nbsp; who purposely target&nbsp; civilians. Of course they have&nbsp; a &#039;logic&#039;, even&nbsp; a&nbsp; serial&nbsp; killer&nbsp; has some&nbsp; logic, bad childhood, soceities&nbsp; own&nbsp; child, but, shall we allow him to kill&nbsp; and chalk that&nbsp; up to&nbsp; &#039;we had it coming?&#039; <br /><br />The problem is&nbsp; this is far worse than some &#039;crime&#039;&nbsp; problem , we treated&nbsp; this way for about 25 years, and it led to 9/11 and even worse if we back off now. It&#039;s&nbsp; not&nbsp; a question of vengance , but, making&nbsp; the use&nbsp; of&nbsp; this kind of&nbsp; &#039;justice&#039; unacceptable&nbsp; or future generations&nbsp; will ask again how we let this grow.

So, why is Osama Bin Laden and his merry band of fundamentalists still alive and taunting us with video and audio tapes 6 years after the fact?

And why does every mention of 9/11 by the Bush administration still mention Saddam Hussein and Iraq in the same breath? Why are we still buying this propaganda?<br /><br />I&#039;ve also knew several people who perished on that horrific day at the WTC, and like everybody else I was 100% behind the promise that was made to us that we will get Osama and eliminate Al Qaeda. Why are we not any closer today than we were 6 years ago?
