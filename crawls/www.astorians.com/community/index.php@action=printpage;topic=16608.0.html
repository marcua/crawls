				I recently ordered a Grandma pizza From Porto Pizza in the shopping center on 43rd and ditmars.&nbsp; What a great pie.&nbsp; Thin crust square pizza with a great garlicky sauce on top of the cheese.&nbsp; Just wanted to spread the word about this delicious pie.&nbsp; Their other pizzas are good too but this one really stands out.&nbsp; The sauce is what makes it.&nbsp; It has lots of garlic and you can tell it is a homemade sauce, not that generic sweet pizza sauce like most mediocre places.&nbsp; <br /><br />www.portobellopizzeria.com

				I love the grandma slices!!! They&#039;re sooooooooooooooo good!!!&nbsp; :mrgreen: :mrgreen: :mrgreen: :mrgreen: :-D :-D :-D<br /><br />Actually I love a lot of the dishes and pizzas from Portobello! My husband and I were there Friday night and it was jam packed. I always get the rigatoni Fiorentina and it&#039;s really great. Hubby likes their Bolognese sauce and always asks me why can&#039;t I make it the way they do? HA. I have to figure out exactly what they put in it because I&#039;ve never made my sauce like that. Maybe because I&#039;m Sicilian/American? lol We use different things in our sauce. I don&#039;t know.<br /><br /><br />

				I love Porto Bello too! &nbsp;:mrgreen: &nbsp;Their ingredients are so flavorful. &nbsp;We just ate there on Saturday and had the veggie lasagna, shrimp fra diavlo, potato croquet and a veggie rice ball. &nbsp;It was all so tasty. &nbsp;They have such superior sauce and cheese. &nbsp;I actually like this place better than most of the Italian/Pizza places in the area. &nbsp;<br /><br />I&#039;m hooked on the pizza too. &nbsp;I&#039;m not that excited about their crust since I like a thinner, less doughy crust but the ingredients on top of the crust are so amazing that I keep going back. &nbsp;<br /><br />I agree with Yaxpac that the Grandma Pizza is awesome and everything goes perfectly together, including the crust on this pizza. &nbsp;It really blew me away the last time I had it. &nbsp;Too bad I&#039;m going to move soon and they&#039;re going to be too far from us for delivery. &nbsp;:cry:

				Their rice balls aren&#039;t the best I&#039;ve tasted. The BEST authentic Sicilian style rice balls are in Bensonhurst Brooklyn on 18th Ave.<br /><br />The calamari at Portobello are really good too. They&#039;re not rubbery or overly breaded like some restaurants make them. I love the chicken Marsala pizza there too. Oh God now I&#039;m getting hungry!

				Rosario&#039;s arancini are excellent.<br /><br />We never order from Porto Bello - I don&#039;t know why.&nbsp; But I&#039;m definitely going to give their Grandma pie a try - sounds great.

				I&#039;m so close to Rizzo&#039;s it&#039;s hard to stray....but I will definitely try Porto Bello&#039;s Grandma pie,... I&#039;m over in that area at least twice a month to eat at Loukoumi...

				We were at a loss about what to order last night, and got the grandma pizza from PortoBella (thanks to this post!).&nbsp; It was excellent.&nbsp; The sauce is what makes it so good.&nbsp; We also got a greek salad, which was fresh and delicious.&nbsp; On the whole, a little pricey, but worth it as a treat for the quality.
