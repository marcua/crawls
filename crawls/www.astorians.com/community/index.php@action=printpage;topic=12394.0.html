				A couple of friends of mine and I are forming a new CSA and we’re looking for people interested in joining the core group of planners.&nbsp; We need committed volunteers to help coordinate with our farmer, set distribution procedures, keep member records, handle outreach and education, and coordinate the distribution site and member volunteer schedules (mainly keeping track of which members will help with distribution on which days.) We’ll be drawing on information from Just Food and past experience to make this the best darn CSA ever, and we’re looking for Astorians (or others!) who want in.&nbsp; Core members should plan on putting in around ten hours per week, especially during the months when we&#039;re organizing members and getting the distribution up and running.&nbsp; If you&#039;re interested, let me know!

				We&#039;re planning on centering the CSA around 30th Ave and Crescent.&nbsp; We&#039;re still in the process of finalizing a distribution site but we were hoping to do it in that area :mrgreen:

				hi!<br />i love the idea of being involved in a CSA right near me! i live on broadway and crescent.<br />i&#039;m vegetarian and feel like i constantly struggle to find quality vegetables in the neighborhood. <br /><br />i have an irregular work schedule (i&#039;m a nurse), so i can commit to 10 hours a week but not always on the same days.<br />however- i do have a lot of weekdays off. <br /><br />-emma<br /><br />

				I wanna help out if it&#039;s needed too. I&#039;m moving to Ditmars next week and I used to get CSA while I lived in Long Island. I would love to have fresh veggies all the time! Let me know I can do. Thanks! :mrgreen:

				That sounds great! I was hoping for a new CSA in Astoria, since the other two seem to be full already. <br /><br />PM me if you&#039;re still looking.

				Would anyone who attended the Just Food &quot;Getting a CSA started&quot; workshop last week like to work together on sending in a request for neighborhood assessment? I&#039;m already in contact with the original poster, and I know there were another 2-3 Astorians at the Thursday meeting I attended. If you&#039;d like to come in contact, please email me at skoullias@gmail.com <br /><br />I&#039;ll collect the emails of whoever has posted them on this and other posts, ask the other CSA&#039;s for waiting lists, and hopefully get an answer from Just Food about Astorians that have contacted them.
