				What are some good places in Astoria to have a 5 year old birthday party? Cost is definitely a factor. I know people spend tons of money on this stuff and I&nbsp; really cannot. I also need a place that can accommodate both parents and kids since most of these kids aren&#039;t old enough to be without supervision. Thanks!

				Astoria Sports Complex. The package comes with two hostesses, pizza and drinks. You also get to choose from several sports - including soccer and batting cage....there is a giant blow up slide for the kids and parents. You just have to bring a birthday cake and that&#039;s it. They supply all the tableware, etc. unless you want to bring your own decorations - I did that, and the hostesses did a nice job decorating the eating area.&nbsp; I had my daughter&#039;s party there last year and it was not too expensive, all things considered. The party area is very large too, so that would not be a concern.

				My son has been to parties at both places mentioned above, Birthday Zone and Astoria Sports Complex and they were both a lot of fun and reasonably priced.&nbsp; Some people have kids parties at Pizza Uno - the kids can make their own pizzas but I&#039;m not sure expensive that is.&nbsp; There&#039;s also Chuck E. Cheese&#039;s and the McDonalds on 31st street has a playspace and they hold parties there to.<br />

				I went to a birthday party hosted in the basement of the Steinway reformed church.&nbsp; They had one of the instructors from their music classes (Music for Ardvarks or Music Together) come and work with the kids and it was a blast!

				I have had my sons birthday parties at the sports complex on 38th st. &amp; at Maric Bowling Lanes (I think it is on 47th St off of 20th ave).&nbsp; By far, the bowling alley was the best party &amp; it was much cheaper.&nbsp; The sports complex was a bit expensive - you have a choice between 2 sports (my son chose swimming &amp; the big infatable slide).&nbsp; They had a hostess, food (pizza) &amp; drinks.&nbsp; I supplied the cake. There is room for adults &amp; you can order pizza for the adults as well. It was nice but expensive. <br /><br />Maric lanes was great.&nbsp; They had 3 lanes to themselves and bowled for an hour then had a choice of pizza or hot dog &amp; fries, drinks &amp; cake.&nbsp; There is also a hostess &amp; I also supplied the cake.&nbsp; There is room for adults &amp; you can also order pizza for the adults.&nbsp; It is much cheaper than the sports complex.&nbsp; They also have a larger room upstairs if you are having alot of children / adults.<br /><br />Also, don&#039;t forget that you can get birthday sheet cakes at Costco for around $15 - $20 &amp; they are tasty.<br /><br />
