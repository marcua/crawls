			Hello everyone,I took the subway up to Ditmars stop this week, usually I am on 30th Ave.&nbsp; There were so many homeless.&nbsp; In the doorways, some in TJ Maxx, an elderly woman asked me for money outside on 23rd Avenue and all along 31st street.&nbsp; I used to live at this stop years ago but don&#039;t remember it being like this.&nbsp; I also saw a bunch of tents beneath an overpass on 38th Avenue and 54th Street as well.&nbsp; &nbsp;Is this due to them being pushed out of another area?&nbsp; Has anyone noticed this surge?<br /><br />
