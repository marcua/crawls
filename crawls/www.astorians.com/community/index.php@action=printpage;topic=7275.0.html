				i&#039;ve been fortunate enough not to have mice in my apartment but my girlfriend has been getting mice in hers. which means i have to take care of it. any ideas besides the usual? clean the place, set traps, stuff little holes with steel wool, etc. oh and she has cats (which, in my opinion are falling down on the job!).

				In my old apartment on Newtown Avenue, I used that expanding foam that hardens, in every possible hole and/or space.&nbsp; For the life of me, I cannot think of the name.&nbsp; Regardless, once every hole was plugged up I never had another mouse.&nbsp; I bought it at home depot.&nbsp; <br /><br />http://www.homeenvy.com/db/9/49.html<br /><br />

				Please use snap traps or humane traps instead of glue traps. Animals caught on glue traps take many, many hours (often days) to die and in the meantime suffer physical pain and often go crazy and try to chew off the parts that are stuck to the trap. You can use humane traps to capture them and release them far from the apartment, or snap traps which kill instantly. Also, both humane and snap traps are reusable. I battled mice in my old apartment so bold they would walk across your foot while you were sitting on the couch. Snap traps got rid of them MUCH more quickly than the glue traps my roommate had tried before I moved in. <br /><br />In general, most of dealing with mice is prevention--leave no food out, no crumbs, etc. Put tempting food on a piece of furniture that stands alone (like a table) or in the refrigerator. Block holes as you&#039;re describing (though I&#039;ve found the expanding hardening foam works better than steel wool). Put snap traps where you&#039;ve seen droppings, and move furniture a little bit away from the wall (so they have fewer places to sneak/hide). Not all cats are great mousers, especially cats who&#039;ve been raised indoors. Usually the scent of the predator is enough to keep mice away, so maybe put a cat toy or something that smells like the cat near where you&#039;ve seen mice?

				When I had to deal with mice a number of years ago, I found that the old-fashioned snap traps worked best, with peanut butter and a raisin as bait. The ones with plastic-cheese as the trigger never worked; the mice just pointed and laughed.<br /><br />Be prepared for some gruesome scenes, though. They don&#039;t always kill cleanly with a neck break, unfortunately.

				A few years back we had quite a problem in our apartment with mice. We put steal wool in every possible hole (radiators, behind the stove, under the door way leading down to the basement- you name it we steel wooled it!) ever since then we haven&#039;t had any mice. <br /><br />I agree with the other posters to use the snap traps- unfortunately we didn&#039;t (I didn&#039;t realize how they would suffer) and I still feel guilty about it to this day.

				I&#039;ve had them on and off in my apartment - right now I&#039;m in an &quot;on&quot; period like your girlfriend.<br /><br /><br />We&#039;ve done it all --&nbsp; steel wool, plastering holes where we could, keeping the place spotless,<br />traps everywhere. <br /><br />I may have a solution for you. My boyfriend suggested getting one of those plug-in devices that emits<br />a sound wave that keeps them away. I put one in my kitchen outlet, one in my living room, and one<br />in a bedroom. <br /><br />Evidence that I think it works: Yesterday morning, as I was taking my dog out, I thought I saw a flash<br />of something in my foyer. When I brought him back, I opened my apartment door and a mouse ran OUT!<br /><br />My theory is that the area by&nbsp; my&nbsp; door was probably where the noise was least offensive and he was<br />looking to escape. <br /><br />The ones I bought are from Black &amp; Decker. Home Depot sells them either in a 3-pack for $16.99 or<br />individually for $6.99 each. <br /><br />Here&#039;s the link for the 3-pack:<br />http://www.homedepot.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay storeId=10051&amp;langId=-1&amp;catalogId=10053&amp;productId=100071416<br /><br />Here&#039;s the link for the single one:<br />http://www.homedepot.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?storeId=10051&amp;langId=-1&amp;catalogId=10053&amp;productId=100004114<br /><br />I bought one of them at the HD on West 23rd St. My mom bought the other 2 at the one on 59th St.<br /><br />They&#039;re out of the 3-packs, but maybe the one on Northern Blvd. has it.<br /><br />Good luck!<br />

				Best mouse (or bug) control device, hands down, is a CAT. <br /><br />If there is any way you can adopt one, please do! Seriously, the mice will stay the heck away from your apt! <br /><br />

				No, it&#039;s not affecting my dog. These newer models have been fine-tuned now so that they&#039;re safe<br />for households with dogs, cats and birds. <br /><br />Also, since these are Black &amp; Decker and I work with them on a lot of stories I do, I was able to<br />speak to someone in their product development dept. who told me it should be safe.<br /><br />And so far, my dog hasn&#039;t even noticed anything.

				Ditto on the recommendation for the plug-in sound wave devices...<br /><br />My boyfriend discovered a pair of mice in his apartment a while back. They were quite brazen, and actually came out to look for food while he was sitting on his couch watching tv one night!<br /><br />He trapped one of them in a homemade Wile E Coyote-type contraption (and released it back outside into the wild). Then he got one of those plug-in sonic devices. Seemed to do the trick: post plug-in, he saw a mouse come in from its secret passage (behind the oven), and the strangest thing happened-- it came in a few feet, stopped dead in its tracks, and started screeching. Turned around and bolted back out its little hole, and never came back.<br /><br />The only subsequent time he ever saw a mouse again was after some workers had been in his apartment. They had unplugged the mouse device so they could plug in a fan. Without the device, a mouse came back, but since he plugged it back in, he&#039;s never seen another one.

				My mom has those plug-in things and I hate them. Aside from hogging the outlets, the noise they make is annoying. Maybe hers are old or something but I get annoyed whenever I&#039;m home and wonder what that noise is, and then I see them and think &quot;Oh yeah.&quot;

				I think your&nbsp; mom must have one of the older ones. <br /><br />We&#039;ve had these three new ones - Black &amp; Decker brand - plugged in for almost a week. <br />I&#039;m super-senstive to noise and you honestly don&#039;t hear anything.<br /><br />My dog also isn&#039;t bothered by them. We&#039;ve been watching him carefully and there&#039;s been<br />no reaction, no difference in his behavior at all. He is older and his hearing isn&#039;t 100%, but<br />I&#039;m sure he&#039;d react if he felt/heard something that bothered him.<br /><br />They&#039;re also a bargain. I paid $7 each or you can get a 3-pack for $16.99 (Home Depot was out<br />of the 3-pack).<br /><br />And they are getting brazen. I had them on my kitchen table 3x - never, ever had that before. <br /><br />Also, slightly off topic here - I saw a rat running around the tracks at the Ditmars Blvd. station&nbsp; --&nbsp; a first for me.<br />
