				Community Board #1 will be having a hearing on the Rezoning Proposal for Astoria <br />Feb 16, 2010; at 7:00 PM at <br />36-01 35th Ave<br />Astoria, NY 11106<br />718 786-3335<br />The proposed zoning map, appears that most of Astoria will be down zoned, yet there are several areas that will be up zoned. See the link below on how these changes may impact you and your immediate area.<br /><br />http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/astoria/index.shtml<br /><br />Anyone with interest should attend this meeting.

				Interesting. I like the general idea, preserving existing housing stock and neighborhood character, while allowing some increased density near the subways, reflecting the need to increase the total population of NYC over the next 20 years or so. Lots of details (for someone) to walk through...<br /><br />On the other hand, they did label a photo of 24th Ave as &quot;Ditmars Blvd&quot;, so their credibility is totally shot.&nbsp; :lol:

				Let the&nbsp; gerrymandering begin. <br /><br />Mt. Sinai&#039;s CEO sits on the Community Board and the site of their proposed new 9 story building is being changed to accommodate this edifice on a residential street. <br /><br />If you would like to have it on your block, please let the City Planning Commission know.<br /><br />I don&#039;t want it on mine . . . which is where they propose on building it.

				<br />Thanks for the link.<br />I would be interested what effects the zoning might have on parking and traffic.<br /><br /><br />It appears to make quite a quilt of a few pockets of low density zones. <br />Are the proposed commercial zones where projects are anticipated or hoped for.<br />On the commercial planning, would track spaces marked Eliminate mean they would remain residential or mixed-use?<br /><br />A really curious mix around 21st to Bway to Vernon. Would it hurt if they left the zoning there as is?<br />Is it to encourage varied construction that way?
