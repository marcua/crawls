				Hi all!<br /><br /><br />I know some of you are going to say I&#039;m crazy or that it is impossible, but hey, I want to give it a shot ;)<br /><br /><br />So here it is : french girl working in PR relocating back to NY in Feb, I used to live in Astoria and loved it there, there is no other place I&#039;d rather live in the entire NY area. I truly love this neighborhood.<br /><br /><br />Been sharing this great appartment back in 2007/2008, and now that I am a professional I&#039;d like to get my own place. I remember the days when you could still find a studio/1BR in the Broadway/30ave area for $1100 a month and I want to believe this is still possible!<br /><br /><br />So here it is : I am looking for a large studio or small 1BR in the Steinway/Broadway area. I want something clean, bedbug free (ughhh), building or house I don&#039;t care. Can be Brokers.&nbsp; Can be Owners. <br /><br /><br />I will be in NY on Feb 13 so anything around this date. <br /><br /><br />Let me know if you know or hear about anything!<br />Thanks!<br />Ami<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Good luck in your search but with you being gone for a while just saying a one bedroom for that price especially on Broadway is impossible . A studio apt might be possible though .&nbsp; &nbsp;Prices in Astoria have gone up alot and even in this economy they are still creeping up again . Astoria seems to be following Manhattan prices lately which have gone up 12% .&nbsp; &nbsp;Sorry to sound negative , just wanted to be realistic .&nbsp; &nbsp;A studio maybe off Broadway , like blocks down can be found for slightly under $1000.&nbsp; &nbsp; My mother inlaw rents out her studio apt for $900 and that includes all with cable and internet too in the Ditmars area . So do others on the block .&nbsp; &nbsp; Craigslist is a good place to search . Good luck .

				no worries Thanos, I know I&#039;m kind of asking for the moon. Definitely considering more of a studio than a 1BR, I think I might be a couple hundreds dollars short for the perfect Astoria 1BR ;)

				I think it&#039;s possible, especially if you&#039;re willing to be off the R train 46th Street stop and if you are considering a studio. A couple brokers I used in my last apartment search (which was December 2010) showed me places around there that were in your price range. And that is a nice neighborhood, in case you haven&#039;t lived east of Steinway near 30 Ave.

				Hi Essen!<br /><br />Thanks for your reply, I see a light at the end of the tunnel (yeah i know i&#039;m being dramatic here - us French people!&nbsp; :wink: )<br />But yeah definitely looking into studios more than 1BR - I actually used to live on 46th and bway so I know the area, it&#039;s also fine. I just heard bad bed bugs stories in this area, so it&#039;s not my first choice! But will definitely look into it!<br />Do you have any brokers to recommend?<br /><br />Let me know!<br />Thanks!<br />Ami<br /><br />

				I personally have had good experiences with Peter Horowitz at My Astoria Real Estate and Jenny at Avanguard Realty, gotten apartments through both of them. They may or may not have apartments available in your price range, but I&#039;d recommend giving them a try. Also I didn&#039;t have any bed bug problems at my last apartment on 30th Ave and 45th Street (I did have a lovely family of house centipedes however), though I don&#039;t doubt they have them at some buildings.

				Hi Amissan,<br />I am also looking in Astoria for some of the same criteria.&nbsp; I was wondering if you had any luck?<br />I just moved to NY from Los Angeles and am staying with a friend of mine while I find a place.&nbsp; I love the feel of Astoria and want to stay over here.<br />&nbsp;<br />If you have had any luck I would love to hear about.<br />&nbsp;<br />Jesse
