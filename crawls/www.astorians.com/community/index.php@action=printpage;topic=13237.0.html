				I just wanted to share this site:<br /><br />Forgiveness for 8 (http://forgivenessfor8.blogspot.com)<br /><br />It&#039;s a website inviting LDS (Mormons) to share their requests for forgivenss from the LGBT community for the church&#039;s support for Prop 8.<br /><br />The letters are incredibly moving and I hope that this site gets spread around so that we are all reminded that no members of a religion, gender, orientation or political party are all one way or another. It&#039;s really very moving to see these responses from the community and it makes me hope that one day the other members of their church will come to feel as these other Mormons do.

While it would have been nice for such individuals to oppose it from the start, I still think it is brave to oppose it now.<br /><br />Other posters talk about how they stood protesting Prop 8 and how they felt when their fellow church members saw them; other about being gay and out to a few of their congregation and being amazed and appalled at the discourse around Prop 8.<br /><br />Long story short, at least read the link before you judge the people.

				actually most of the apologies are from mormons who disagreed with prop 8 but were afraid to speak up for fear of being judged by their church communities. i don&#039;t think i noticed any posts from mormons who vote for prop 8 and now regret it. from what i can tell, the site is run by and for lds members who are unhappy with their church&#039;s influence in that election.

				Are there hard numbers on what impact LDS involvement had on the vote?<br /><br />In other words, is it a foregone conclusion that the vote wouldn&#039;t have gone the same way without the infusion of LDS funds?&nbsp; I read some articles suggesting that the opposition campaign was poorly organized, and that lack of organization, coupled with some of the demographics showing up for Obama could have been the real game changer.

				Gee, that&#039;s nice. Now, can someone&nbsp; find&nbsp; a link from a website where Muslims&nbsp; are begging forgiveness and apologizing for&nbsp; Muslims&nbsp; executing&nbsp; Gay People&nbsp; in predominately&nbsp; Muslim nations? Oh, wait,here&#039;s something..http://www.alterheros.com/english/dossier/Articles.cfm?InfoID=76 <br /><br />How about&nbsp; Sean Penn&nbsp; apologizing for&nbsp; supporting Castro&nbsp; and Chavez, two&nbsp; dictators&nbsp; who jail&nbsp; people&nbsp; with AIDS? Oh, that&#039;s right, Sean made&nbsp; a movie&nbsp; about the assassinated Mayor Of San Fran, Harvey Milk, so he gets&nbsp; a &#039;pass?&#039;&nbsp; :|&nbsp; I guess &#039;Nobody Listened&#039; http://www.amazon.com/Nobody-Listened-Jorge-Ulla/dp/B0001Z4PKA&nbsp; then and no one is listening now?&nbsp; :-( It&#039;s&nbsp; all &#039;PC&#039;/Lefty feel good nonsense, with no sense of proportion. If I was really interested&nbsp; in Prop 8, either way, and I&#039;m only mildly interested, I would&nbsp; make a deal with Gay Activists. I would support it&#039;s repeal and even advocate for Civil Unions with the same rights as marriage, if they joined&nbsp; me in a Global Protest&nbsp; against&nbsp; the policies of&nbsp; predominate&nbsp; Muslim&nbsp; and Communist&nbsp; nations, on human rights, and Gay Rights in particular.
