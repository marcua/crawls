				Hey everyone! My name is Mike and I&#039; m from eastern Long Island. Im Looking to move to Astoria as I work in Manhattan and want a closer commute. I could use a ton of locals advice. In my search for an apartment I found one I really like and its on 42nd Street between 28th and 30th avenue. <br /><br /><br />Upon some further research I found out on trulia.com that the neighborhood has a high crime rating and I also found articles about shootings and stabbings in the area within the recent years. I&#039;m wondering if this area not a good or safe area to live in? When I visited the area it seemed like a good area- close to 30th avenue (which seems to be busy and a lot of commercial establishments) and 42nd street seemed like a nice tree lined street... so I was surprised to find the crime rating to be on the high side and not sure what to believe. Also could anybody let me know what areas are safe and which ones to stay away from in Astoria?

				&nbsp;There have been some incidents on Steinway,almost all related to the late night clientele frequenting the Hookah bars. On the whole,its a great neighborhood,thats a nice block. IMO,if looking to move to Astoria,you will be very happy on that block.

				I grew up on the northern end where things might be sleepier and less crowded, but it also might be safer. Plus if you can find a place with proximity to the Ditmars N/Q stop you&#039;ll always get a seat on the train.

				I&#039;m on 47th closer to Broadway, so in the vicinity, it&#039;s not a bad are, but it gets a little hinky at night...the subway commutes have been horrific lately ( this summer was hell with signal delays, construction reroutes, and closures for construction). Subways have been really crowded. All in all though, its a really nice area, a little less noisy than some other areas, and its got a lot of great food options. You can&#039;t really lose when you move to Astoria. It&#039;s a great neighborhood.

				what the hell is Trulia talking about - - what garbage.&nbsp; Astoria is one of the safest areas in the city.&nbsp; And I&#039;ve lived here since 1962 - yes 1962.&nbsp; Do not fear living in Astoria AT ALL.&nbsp; The N train is packed until 11pm and so it is safe.&nbsp; The block you referenced is a good one and it gets even nicer as you go a little further north&nbsp; - - but then the walk to the N is longer.<br /><br /><br />Anyway, welcome to the neighborhood&nbsp; - - you&#039;ll love it.
