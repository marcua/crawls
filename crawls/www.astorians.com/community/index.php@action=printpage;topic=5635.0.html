				I was kind of blown away by the responses I got in the global warming thread, so I&#039;m wondering what more people actually think of this. If people drive another species to extinction, is that anything we should be concerned with?

				when humans kill off another species, not for food but just to see them die, yeah, I think it&#039;s wrong. There may be another species that kills off thousands of animals, eating none of them, just for &quot;sport&quot;, but I can&#039;t think what that species would be. <br /><br />I think ecological diversity is more important than we understand yet. I think the earth itself is full of things, principles and processess we know nothing about - and don&#039;t even know that we know nothing about them. And when we know that little, I think we should effing be careful.

				If we as a species are responsible for the extintion of another species, environment, etc.. There should be concern, guilt and thoughts about what we can do to fix the problem.

				Given what we know in today&#039;s age, then I would say the answer is no, it is not acceptable.<br /><br />However, the example of the dodo is not quite cricket. &nbsp;Its not fair to impose a 20th century outlook on the events of the past, otherwise people five centuries from now will think that we are all ignorant SOB&#039;s.

				Quite apart from ethical considerations (which are what I think you&#039;re mostly concerned with here) there&#039;s a good deal of ecological harm that comes from driving species to extinction. Pretty much everything done in this field in the past 50+ years is telling us high biodiversity = good, low biodiversity = bad. So the more we eliminate, the worse things get - for us! We have selfish motivations to want to see this stop! <br /><br />And remember its not just what we see - the passenger pigeon, the dodo, the panda, the polar bear, the tigers etc. Many species of insects, birds, fish, shellfish and little-heard of or mourned mammals, not to mention HEAPS of plant species are going extinct every day. This isn&#039;t a hypothetical question. Nor is it realistic to say we&#039;re capable of stopping every single extinction. However, we can certainly ameliorate the rate at which they are occurring, and manage some species in clever manners (eg: the zoo breeding programs for pandas, tigers etc. - although these have their own problems as regards reintroduction into native habitats, and probably will only help big, visible, &#039;cute&#039; animals). Destructive overfishing practices, land clearing, and education are major factors too. If it were as simple as stopping developed nation&#039;s hunters from going out there and getting trophies, we coulda stopped it long ago. But stopping Indonesia from burning forest to clear land, or Brazil from doing the same, stopping Chinese trade in endangered species for &#039;medical&#039; purposes, and controlling the &#039;commons&#039; that are international waters are much more complicated issues.

				Thanks for the responses. I was wondering when it became weird to care about humanity&#039;s effects on animals and plants, but thankfully that is not the case. <br /><br />While most people probably intuitively believe it&#039;s wrong to kill off entire species, a philosophical problem seems to come in where humans <em>are</em> animals, and if any other animal kills off a species it&#039;s just nature at work, whereas if humans do it it&#039;s wrong and we shouldn&#039;t do that. On the surface, it doesn&#039;t add up. But even from that standpoint, there are some obvious and significant differences between us and other animal species, the most important in this case being our intelligence and the power we have as a result. <br /><br />At this point in our development, humans should not be put on the same moral level as other animals. We know better than that. Unfortunately, the drive for power, personal success, and comfort makes it hard to see the big picture sometimes. Just as some people think clearing land for development is more important than preserving other animals&#039; habitats, some people don&#039;t want to enact strict pollution laws because they could hurt our economy. Some people don&#039;t want to give up their gas-guzzlers as long as they can afford the gas. Unless you hold the view that humans must&#039;ve evolved because there were simply too many plant and animal species on this planet and we need to find ways to clear them out, there&#039;s no reason why we shouldn&#039;t keep ourselves in check. There&#039;s more to the world than what we put into it.

When one non-human animal group completely decimates another non-human animal group, how often are humans involved as non-predators (by introducing a foreign predator, by altering the ecosystem, etc)? <br /><br />When humans are completely innocent (to use a loaded word) in a species&#039; extinction, what are the circumstances? Failure to adapt to new circumstances, I&#039;m assuming .... still, I think this makes an interesting question. <br />
