				Okay guys. &nbsp;You're good at this kind of thing. &nbsp;Help me finish off my plan for dinner tonight. &nbsp;Today's my birthday and I'm doing something simple at home... so I want one more side dish that is simple, tasty and preferraby not green.<br /><br />We're having...<br /><br />Roasted chicken with sage, rosemary and (probably) thyme<br />Horseradish mashed potatoes and rutababa<br />Either Salad (Arugula or spinach) or sauteed spinach.<br /><br />I need one more thing and I can't think of something I want to cook. &nbsp;Any suggestions?

				There is a nice salad I make (mostly in the summertime) that is grated apples and carrots, with lemon and orange juice, currants, and some salt. &nbsp;It can sit and marinate for a bit, or you can eat it right away. &nbsp;It would make a nice contrast to your savory items, plus it's raw. &nbsp;And not green! &nbsp;Quite delicious, too.

				having 2nd thoughts about that recipe in terms of 'simplicity'.. but it could be simplified I'm sure, and it uses similar spices to what you have already.

				As it's your birthday I think you shouldn't have to cook. &nbsp;But maybe you enjoy cooking (I do enjoy cooking but not enough to do it on my <em>birthday</em>) so I shouldn't jump to conclusions.<br /><br />Anyway. &nbsp;Soup. &nbsp;I'm a big soup fan, especially at this time of year.<br /><br />If you have any surplus chicken, you can always toss it in the pot with some carrots, celery, onions, parsnips and dill. &nbsp;Or a nice lentil soup would--no. &nbsp;scratch that. &nbsp;You are not allowed to stand there cleaning legumes on your birthday. &nbsp;How about...OK, this is not to everyone's taste but what about picking up a couple cans of baby oysters, some light cream, fresh garlic, old bay, cayenne pepper and a little parsley or cilantro, cook up a nice oyster stew?<br /><br />If you don't want to go the soup route, perhaps a fish course. &nbsp;Maybe some pickled herring--that's easy. &nbsp;Does it go with roasted chicken? &nbsp;Probably not, but I don't know what goes with what.<br /><br />Oh, we're overlooking the obvious here--your one extra thing could be dessert.<br /><br />Oh man you can tell I worked through lunch.

				I *do* like cooking. &nbsp;A lot in fact. &nbsp;So it was my idea to have everyone over for dinner, but the number has just swollen to 8... which is a lot of people to cook for. &nbsp;<br /><br />Thanks for your suggestions, guys... I haven't decided yet, but I'm thinking maybe a take on Meg's Carrot salad that includes the beets that tuesday suggested. &nbsp;Something cold like that would be nice. &nbsp;<br /><br />The oyster soup idea just make me really hungry. &nbsp;And I did eat lunch. &nbsp;Mmmmmm.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 9px;" class="bbc_size"><br />Someone else better be making the cake. &nbsp;I hope they remember. :? &nbsp;</span>

				just another way to think about it<br /><br />things that are not green:<br />winter squash<br />cauliflower<br />carrots<br />beets<br />radishes<br />eggplants<br />tomatoes<br />mushrooms<br />radicchio<br />red cabbage<br /><br />methods of cooking:<br />braising<br />sauteeing<br />frying<br />broiling<br />boiling<br />blanching<br />baking<br />RAW<br /><br />possible cooking liquids/fats:<br />olive oil<br />peanut oil<br />sesame oil<br />wine<br />sherry<br />broth<br />juice

				Im sure its too late but...<br /><br />roast a head of garlic in foil or small clay dish, first bath it in olive oil, fresh rosemary and some sea salt.<br /><br />when its done (very fragrant), smear it on some good fresh baked bread.<br /><br />or the beets, goat cheese, walnuts sound terrific too.<br /><br />Happy birthday!

				Thanks, guys. &nbsp;I knew some of you would have suggestions.<br /><br />It was very good. &nbsp;Someone brought cheese and crackers, so I was full from salami and havarti before we even cut the chicken. &nbsp;The chicken was great... butter with herbs and garlic under the skin and then baked; it was resting when everyone got there, but when we cut it we had problems containing the juice.... we don't own real adult serving platters. &nbsp;we also don't own enough plates to feed our friends and had to ask a few people to bring their own. &nbsp;We also had easy saut√©ed spinach with garlic, those horseradish mashed potatoes and rutabaga (very good), baked tomatoes with the same herbs that were in the chicken and a shredded carrot and fennel salad with a simple lemon dressing-- inspired by meg!<br /><br />Then cake and cupcakes! &nbsp;Yeaaaa birthday!!! &nbsp;Now I'm a few days older.<br /><br />Jonathan-- I usually just roast my garlic with the chicken or wrapped in aluminum foil. &nbsp;As mentioned earlier, we don't have a ton of dishes. &nbsp;Are the terracotta garlic roasters worth it? Can you use them for other things?

				oh, that's a good question! I love roast garlic, but I try to avoid one-task tools. Doesn't anyone have one of those and feel like they couldn't live without it?

				happy birthday again.<br /><br />If you do not have the terra cotta dont buy it. &nbsp; sounds like you need plates and basics anyway. &nbsp;ikea is good for that.<br /><br />two great ways to roast garlic:<br />1. wrap it in foil with some good oil, salt and herbs as options.<br />2. the way we do it at the kitchen is to peel tons of cloves, put them in a baking dish or overn proof container, cover with good oil and bake till lightly browned, soft and fragrant. &nbsp;it goes into all my dishes.
