				I am looking for other Astorians who might have complaints against specific officers in 114. I am interested in one particular officer who is abusing power unfairly against the people in our own neighborhood. If you are just angry because you got hit with a parking ticket please don&#039;t bother. I am looking for serious abuse of power issues. I would like to be able to present a complete case to the civilian complaint review board. Please PM me if you have had a run-in with a 114 officer who has abused power and I will provide more info about what I am organizing. We have more power in numbers. Thank you.

				I&#039;ve actually had quite a different experience- I don&#039;t think I could get a hold of a 114th precinct officer long enough for him to abuse his power since they never answer their phone, rarely are patrolling the neighborhood and seem to have a general apathy for everything...<br /><br />...that is, unless it&#039;s alternate side parking day.

				Don&#039;t only thing I hate about them is the abuse of Siren...<br /><br />They always make a left turn on the GCP exit by BURGER King ( It&#039;s a one way street, and they are going the other way).

				I don&#039;t know if this counts, because its a ticket complaint... but it certainly got us upset... a 114 officer pulled us over one day because my hubby wasn&#039;t wearing a seatbelt. My hubby gave him a PBA card with his license and reg. The officer got visibly upset and threw the card back at him, mumbled a bunch of things we couldn&#039;t understand and came back with 3 tickets-one for seatbelt, one for speeding (we weren&#039;t) and one for illegal tint (for factory tint that we can&#039;t take off). <br /><br />Hubby called his PO buddy who had given him the PBA card and that officer called the one who issued the tickets. The officer said he would just put in the one for seatbelt, which he did. He told our officer friend that we were insolent and shouted insults at him, mouthed off, etc. <br /><br />Fast forward, 2 weeks later, the same officer sees my hubby&#039;s truck in parked in the driveway in front of our garage and tells him he&#039;s issuing a ticket for double parking and another for running the engine (idling), neither of which were the case. My husband was dumbfounded. We fought the tickets and did not win but got a reduced fine on both.<br /><br />Fast forward to the next week where this officer &quot;escorted&quot; our truck home from the other side of Astoria and then circled our block a few more times.<br /><br />We were scared. I haven&#039;t seen him around lately-THANK GOD.

				How do you get from not wearing a seat belt to &quot;breaking the law with impunity.&quot;&nbsp; Talk about an exaggeration.<br /><br />Last time that I checked it was against the law not to wear a seat belt while in the front seat of a car.&nbsp; The poster obviously knew that her husband had done something wrong and was going to receive a ticket, which is why he thought that he should use his &quot;get out jail free&quot; card. Only the cop got mad at the nerve of the husband (Scofflaw) for thinking that he was special because he had a cop as a friend.<br /><br />To make matters worse, the poster contacted her cop friend who &quot;persuaded&quot; the officer to only file one ticket instead of THREE, which probably really made the cop mad.&nbsp; The cop then caught the same individual BREAKING the LAW a second time and wrote another ticket, which is what he should have done<br />It would seem to me, that if you don&#039;t want a ticket, then don&#039;t break the law. Pretty simple really.<br /><br />What we have here is a case of an honest cop doing his job.<br /><br />

				No what you have is a cop throwing his power around. If he just ticketed them for the seatbelt it would have been one thing. But the other 2 were not called for. That is why she called it in. <br /><br />Remember this person was driving without a seatbelt, not speading, not running lights, not driving drunk.

				It sounds to me like this is a cop on a power trip who is into intimidation tactics and abusing his power.&nbsp; The only ticket that was called for was the seatbelt.&nbsp; Yes, the PBA card shouldn&#039;t have been used, but it sounds like this cop is an asshole regardless and was ticketing them for things that were uncalled for, and has since proceeded to try to intimidate them and issue them tickets for yet more infractions that did not happen.&nbsp; If you have his name, perhaps you should document all the occurrences and report him.&nbsp; Speak to a lawyer first though.&nbsp; He seems dangerous, to be actually seeking you guys out and following you home like that.

				No, a PBA card is something you give to a cop when you get pulled over to let them know you have family on the force. Each cop is given a certain amount of PBA cards each year and they are allowed to give them to immediate family. It&#039;s not a &quot;get out of jail free card&quot; or a bribe. It&#039;s something that shows them that you have family on the force and it&#039;s one of the perks of being a cop and having family on the force. It&#039;s not fair that some people have one and others don&#039;t, but it&#039;s a reality. That said, when I get pulled over, my NYPD family members have told me to always give them my card.

				Astoristani, you&#039;ve got it kind of wrong. The seatbelt ticket we paid-it was a rightfully given ticket. You always give the PBA card if its something minor in the hopes that they will let you off with a warning. The others were bogus. How can an officer have that kind of power? Who would believe that we weren&#039;t speeding? Who would believe we weren&#039;t double parked or idling? Everyone takes the officer&#039;s word automatically because he is supposed to uphold the law. In this case, this officer is abusing his position of trust for whatever reason. We thought that if it continued, the best thing to do was get a camera in the car, to prove what was going on. Fortunately, it hasn&#039;t happened again because I really didn&#039;t want to go to that expense and trouble because of someone else&#039;s issues.

				a PBA card is something that requires a certain amount of tact when playing it.&nbsp; the way it was described coming into play here sounds like its saying &quot;i&#039;m above the law&quot;.&nbsp; you got caught, deal with it, don&#039;t try and weasel out and then cry to the internet when you can&#039;t.&nbsp; how do you know you weren&#039;t speeding, most drivers don&#039;t realize when they are.&nbsp; do you even know what the speed limit is on local city streets?&nbsp; plus you are admitting guilt by saying its the factory tint.&nbsp; its not the factories fault you decided to get that option... some places its legal, some not, you could have gotten the clears when you bought it.&nbsp; you say you parked in your driveway in front of your garage.&nbsp; having a sliver of bumper sticking out over the sidewalk is grounds for a ticket.&nbsp; you are a reckless driver who tried to wiggle his way out of the consequences of being caught, and the officer is trying to protect the public, and your passengers, from people like you.&nbsp; in the officers eyes, because you are in such denial, most likely you will do it again and its his job to be there when you do.<br /><br />plus, alot of people in this thread are quick to defend, but weren&#039;t there to see what happened.&nbsp; we&#039;re just hearing one side of the story here, which is the age-old, &quot;Your Honor, i swear, i didn&#039;t do it, i am innocent i tell ya!&quot;.

				I guess I still don&#039;t understand what the PBA card is for.
