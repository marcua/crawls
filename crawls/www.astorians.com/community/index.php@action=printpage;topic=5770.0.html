				Welcome to the neighborhood! <br /><br />-Organic/Free Range Chicken (fresh)-<br />thread on Butcher shop, International carries organic chicken, but so does Key Food on 31st and 30th Ave:<br />http://www.astorians.com/index.php?topic=4599.0<br /><br />-Espresso/Coffee shop-<br />I&#039;ve had good Espresso at Omonia, 35th? and Broadway.<br /><br />-Ice Cream, Gelato or Frozen Custard (homemade stuff)-<br />Martha&#039;s Bakery on 38th and Ditmars has gelato but it&#039;s not my favorite. There&#039;s also Cold Stone Creamery on 36th? and Broadway. That&#039;s actually something Astoria could use... a nice Ice Cream place. The guy from 5 Boroughs Ice Cream said he&#039;s been looking to open something up here, though, so you never know...<br /><br />-Cheese shop<br />a whole thread on cheese from this board:<br />http://www.astorians.com/index.php?topic=5294.0

				Here&#039;s (http://www.astorians.com/index.php?topic=4225.0) a thread about organic/free range meats available in the Ditmars area.<br /><br />More information (http://www.astorians.com/index.php?topic=377.msg1433#msg1433) about some choices, including cheese, around Ditmars.<br /><br />There is an organic food market, Fresh Start, on 23rd Ave. between 31st and 29th that carries organic chicken and a few other meat products - Applegate farms bacon, that sort of thing.<br /><br />A couple of other options in the Ditmars area:<br /><br />-Espresso/Coffee shop - Freeze Peach, on 29th St. just off Ditmars.<br /><br />-gelato - La Guli has a wide range of homemade gelati and Italian ice in the summer months.&nbsp; I much prefer their stuff to what Martha&#039;s offers.<br /><br />Elsewhere - a couple of flavours of 5 Boroughs ice cream is available at the Bravo supermarket on 34th Ave. and 35th (ish) st.&nbsp; The spicy chocolate is deadly.&nbsp; The espresso at Il Bambino, 31st Ave. around 35th St., is very good.<br /><br />Thread (http://www.astorians.com/index.php?topic=5090.0) on vintage shops in Astoria.

				I just moved here too, and I&#039;ve been searching for all the same &quot;stuffs&quot; as you!&nbsp; Berry Fresh Farms, the new supermarket that opened across from the condos on 45th, has a pretty decent cheese counter in the back.&nbsp; I was looking for a cheese that they didn&#039;t have, and the guy brought it in for me the next week.

It&#039;s one block up from Ditmars on 31st Street, across the street from the stores around Thai Elephant and Pick 99. http://mimiscloset.net/store.html<br />Again it&#039;s not cheap, but they have some very nice stuff.

They have all sorts of stuff you didn&#039;t know you wanted or needed, plus what you went in there for in the first place.<br />I&#039;d say they are between Steinway and 31st somewhere on the right side if you are walking toward Steinway.<br /><br />Margaret

				Most of your other questions have been answered, so I will deal with my area of expertise.<br />The Salvation Army at the corner of Steinway and 34th Ave., right over the 34th Ave. Steinway R train station exit.<br />This has been touted as the largest Salvation Army store in the country (I read that somewhere once). It is bigger and more pleasant than most of the others in New York City.&nbsp; I used to travel to a couple of other SA&#039;s, but now I just figure if God wants me to have it, it will find its way to this Sally&#039;s, and I will hear it calling to me as I walk out of the train station (that&#039;s usually how it works, too)<br />The furniture selection is good, but the best part about this store is the good selection of quality clothing for men, women, and children (I can dress exclusively in Ann Taylor, Banana Republic, and J. Crew, or I can spice things up here and there with a Prada, or Christian Dior, or Armani....&nbsp; Okay, you can find Gap, H&amp;M, Zara, and others, as well, and they do have a good selection of larger sizes for those of you who are leaving the small sizes for moi.)&nbsp; I love it... I don&#039;t have to go to Macy&#039;s or Bloomingdale&#039;s and suffer the stress, and I can find Bergdorf Goodman and Barney&#039;s merchandise half the time and walk out with a sack of clothes for under $30.<br />Make it a stop on your busy route.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=5770.msg65400#msg65400">Quote from: Lola on March 30, 2007, 01:07:22 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Does anyone know where I can find this stuff in Astoria?

The staff is friendly, and you can find some really good stuff in there (clothes, books, knick knacks, dishes, etc. - not really furniture, though).

				If you&#039;re willing to spent a lot of time looking through massive amounts of stuff that&#039;s only loosely organized, check out &quot;Second Best Thrift Shop&quot; It&#039;s right by the Astoria Blvd train station - you can see it from the platform. They have TONS of furniture, household goods, etc... plus a lot of random stuff like old film projectors, record players, etc.
