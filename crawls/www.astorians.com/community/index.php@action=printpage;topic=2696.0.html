				As has been repeatedly said here and on chowhound, there is no good Chinese in Astoria.&nbsp; However, there are <em>tons</em> of Chinese restaurants with Golden, Dragon or Wok in their name.&nbsp; So, which of all of these restaurants that suck is the best?&nbsp; Is there one that&#39;s passable.&nbsp; I&#39;ve only tried one, because it was the end of a Jewish holiday and I really felt the need to be a traditional Jew and have Chinese food.<br /><br />Any thoughts?&nbsp; Does anyone <em>settle</em> for a specific place when they really have a Chinese food craving?

				We like Golden Chopsticks next to Trade Fair on Ditmars.&nbsp; I really like their hot and sour soup, especially when I&#39;m sick - it&#39;s nicely hot and sour, and it&#39;s got a nice assortment of veggies, mushrooms and meat.&nbsp; Their broccoli is always really fresh and crisply cooked, the chicken is good, and their noodles taste good when you&#39;re hungover.&nbsp; We&#39;ve been ordering from them for something like 14 years (or if they haven&#39;t been open that long, since they opened).

				Eblack - you are right, it was awful.&nbsp; If it had been under the first one or early on, I wouldn&#39;t have felt so ill.&nbsp; They used to make an incredible Chicken Chow Mei Fun and good dumplings, but after that I&#39;ve avoided it, in all its incarnations (It&#39;s been Sunrise for a while now though).<br /><br />Lanseaux - I&#39;ve been looking for good hot and sour soup in Astoria and hadn&#39;t found any.&nbsp; I&#39;ll have to check them out.&nbsp; Do you know if they deliver south of Astoria Boulevard?

				I must say we have always had a great experience ordering in from Nu Ho Wah on the corner of 42nd and Broadway, the veggies are always fresh and the thing I love the most is they will even deliver just a soup and egg roll when I am not feeling well as I just love thier wonton soup. Thier hot and sour is pretty kickin too. The prices have gone up a lil bit recently, however so has everywhere else. Try it, you might like it. Thier number is 718-956-1849.

				Flower Drum House, just south of 21st Ave, is okay, I think. Some things are better than others, but frankly I always went to them because they were right across the street from our apartment. My boyfriend WON&#39;T order from them for any reason, saying he once watched a cockroach crawl unhindered pretty much all around the kitchen. Personally, I&#39;ve been in restaurants in Manhattan where the occasional roach has run right across the table, and chalked it up to urban living, so I suppose I&#39;m not the best gauge for this sort of thing.<br /><br />That one on the way from the Ditmars subway stop, right there on 31st, frightens me a bit, though. That one looks really...rough. What is it...Golden Dragon? Golden Phoenix? Dragon Phoenix Something?<br /><br />A long time ago, I lived on 41st and Astoria B, and made a habit out of wonton soup from New Panda Queen. Perhaps because I had to pass it on the way home, and I&#39;m just damned lazy.

				Has Sampan changed chefs or owners?&nbsp; Last time I was there was around 1995 or so, and I remember it being bad - I haven&#39;t been back since, but people keep saying it&#39;s good, so I&#39;m wondering if it changed hands?

				It&#39;s true that there are no good Chinese restaurants in Astoria. There was an excellent one on Steinway Street, across from the old Astoria Theater (I can&#39;t remember the name now, I believe it&#39;s where the Gothic furniture store is) which closed at least 10 years ago. Almost all the restaurants now are the take out type, with limited dining space. But even Chinatown is like that now, they used tohave alot of great places to sit and eat, only a scant few remain. What&#39;s the deal, isn&#39;t chinese cuisine considered dining-out fare anymore, or is it just more profitable to have the take out store?<br /><br />I frequent the Golden House, they&#39;re food is pretty decent, although the recipes and taste tends to vary from weeks to week.&nbsp; &nbsp;

Well, I suppose it makes sense if you&#39;re going to be in business across from a mosque. The mosque had just opened when I moved from the neighborhood, and the neighborhood still was a little more mixed, so could support a non-halal takeout. I&#39;ve been back since, and the Egyptian community has continued to grow, so I suppose the halal option must be very welcome.<br /><br />Sad that it&#39;s taken it&#39;s toll on the food quality, though.

				Hey McDirk, I must live near you, very close to Sunrise.&nbsp; I stopped going there in part because the food didn&#39;t really impress me much (could Chinese take-out every impress?) but also because the woman who is always behind the counter never says thank you oar ackowledges you in anyway after taking your money...never.&nbsp; I guess I&#39;m sensitive to that as a marketing person.&nbsp; So now I go to Nu Ho Wah also.&nbsp; The food seems fresher and the people more appreciative. Maybe it&#39;s all in my head.&nbsp; In any event, I figure the extra walk is worth the exercise ;)<br /><br />

Of course they have never met our standard for great chinese a la our favorite place, Dynasty (R.I.P.- 2004) on 110th and Broadway on the UWS, however out of all the places we have tried in Astoria they do seem to be the freshest and it is always nice when you do not even have to give your address when ordering out, however that could also be from the fact that we order from them at least twice a week, lol. As mentioned before Mei Jia is decent as well, however only a few dishes there are on my top 10 list. We actually ordered from a place on Northern Blvd. by the name of Eastern, recently after getting a menu under our door, they are Chinese and Japanese and I must say from what we ordered, which was mostly from the Japanese menu, was DEE-LISH, we have ordered from them a couple more times and they are prompt and the food is always nicely presented for an order in situation. Just another reason to LOVE Astoria!!!!! Anywho, best dishes :)

I thought I died and went to heaven when I got a job in the area as I could eat there everyday, however the dream only lasted for so long. I see someone posted about Columbia Cottage and although they are good and some of the fine folks from Dynasty went to CC, they just do not have the selection that Dynasty did. As far as Eastern on Northern is concerned, like I said we have only ordered mostly from the Japanese side of the menu and it was superb. He got the katsu bento box, which is HUGE for the price, the Miso soup is YUM and the house salad is run of the mill, yet still fresh and tasty.&nbsp; I ordered a few veggie rolls and an&nbsp; order of the veggie dumplings, which were tasty, however a lil on the cool side (which was refreshing during the recent heat wave). From the Chinese menu I have only ordered the Broccoli with brown sauce and it was O.K. (NHW&#39;s is much better). I will post the number on the board when I get home. <br />I would like to let you know of another recommendation for Chinese, however not in Astoria, it is in midtown Man. named Wu Liang Ye and it comes very close to replicating the authentic taste of Dynasty. We try to make it there once or twice a month, however they are a lil more pricey, however very much worth it and the Schezuan dishes rock!

				I love Wu Liang Ye - they have an amazing hot pot.<br />Columbia Cottage was good, but never as good as Dynasty (though CC gave you free wine, and I don&#39;t remember Dynasty doing that - though I always got tea and a diet coke there).<br />Westside Market was the grocery store and it was amazing.&nbsp; It was a mini-Zabar&#39;s and I miss it.

				The place on Ditmars by the subway is called Golden Phoenix, I believe.&nbsp; There&#39;s another place on Ditmars and 29th owned by the same people that&#39;s called Happy Family or something of the sort.&nbsp; I used to get the Kung Pao chicken from them all the time when I lived on 35th st. but could never really get into the huge chunks of onion that came with that particular dish.<br /><br />Their Hot &amp; Sour soup is really good, though.

				Joe&#39;s Shanghai has amazing soup dumplings (Shau Lon Pau) - Janelane is right - they&#39;re worth the trip (and you&#39;ll dream about them if you&#39;re not careful).<br />There is a location in Manhattan as well, down on Pell Street off the Bowery.

				It&#39;s usually busy, and they do communal seating, so unless you get a small table or have a group of 8-10, you end up sitting with folks you don&#39;t know, which is sometimes good, and sometimes less so.&nbsp; <br />Shanghai Garden on Elizabeth, just South of the 5th Police Precinct is even better, in my opinion.&nbsp; They have incredible soup dumplings.

				I live south of GCP so I don&#39;t know the Ditmars area, but my four &quot;best of the worst&quot; Chinese places are these:<br /><br />Golden Dragon on 31st Ave. is the best flavor-wise, but they don&#39;t serve the food with brown rice--at least they don&#39;t say so on the menu.<br /><br />Sunrise--sorry I haven&#39;t had any bug experiences with them.<br /><br />No. 1 Kitchen on 30th Ave.--it serves the dishes I like in small portions with brown rice, but their regular cook must be on vacation.&nbsp; The last Szechuan shrimp I had from them was not up to snuff.<br /><br />Lilly&#39;s on 30th Ave.--their veggies are the freshest, but you&#39;d better make sure they get your order right.

I also have fallen in love with the chicken curry off of the Japanese menu, they have a good selection of veggie rolls as well, I love the avo, cuc and asparagus.

				Foodjunkie, I&#39;m glad you like Eastern on Northern Blvd., because I&#39;m thinking of ordering from Eastern near 21st St.&nbsp; Long ago, when I lived in Manhattan, I loved the chicken with eggplant in garlic sauce from a certain Chinese restaurant in the Gramercy-Murray Hill area.&nbsp; That restaurant closed up years ago and I&#39;ve been wondering where to get something like my beloved Shangchur chicken.<br /><br />I&#39;ll also have to try that Hunan on 34th Ave.<br /><br />But meanwhile, the worst has gotten a little better.&nbsp; Golden Dragon, on 31st Avenue, now gives a choice of brown rice with all the entrees that come with rice.

				I had friends visiting from London in December, and my one friend wanted to have Chinese takeout so she could eat from the white box -- she&#39;s seen it in movies and wanted the experience.&nbsp; I ordered something like $60 worth of food from Golden Chopsticks (I didn&#39;t know it was possible to order $60 worth!) -- just an assortment of dishes.&nbsp; It was <em>a lot</em> of food - we had leftovers for days.&nbsp; Everything was great and my friend was tickled to be able to eat from the classic Chinese food takeout container.&nbsp; I agree, Meg, the portion of cold sesame noodles is huge!<br /><br />There are actually two different ways they make the General Tso&#39;s at Golden Chopsticks.&nbsp; The more common way is as you had it, which I think is a more standard representation of the dish.&nbsp; I agree that it&#39;s a little sweet, but the chicken is always tasty, and the broccoli with it nice and fresh.&nbsp; The other is much better -- must be a different cook who only works there sometimes.&nbsp; It&#39;s much less sweet (my preference), and spicier (even if you don&#39;t ask for it spicy).&nbsp; It&#39;s what I think General Tso&#39;s should be all the time.<br /><br />Their hot and sour soup is fantastic in cold weather or when you&#39;re sick.&nbsp; They are very consistent.

				Life is very strange.&nbsp; I just checked this thread last night to find somewhere to order from, but didn&#39;t see anything that appealed to me.&nbsp; I went through my menus and found one for King&#39;s Chef on 43rd and 28th.&nbsp; I think they must have a wide delivery range.<br /><br />The food was actually pretty good.&nbsp; And they sell in small (pint) or large (quart) size, which I love, because I can sample without spending too much money.&nbsp; No white cardboard containers, though.&nbsp; All plastic.<br /><br />When I got my food it came with a menu and I realized I had an old one and two of the 3 items I ordered weren&#39;t on it, so I don&#39;t know what I really got.&nbsp; I ordered &quot;Hot and Spicy Chicken&quot; which is always a gamble.&nbsp; It ended up being chicken in a slightly spicy sauce, but it wasn&#39;t super sweet like many of the chinese places in Astoria make their sauces.&nbsp; It had a lot of green peppers and onions (maybe too much) that were fresh.<br /><br />The steamed Shrimp Dumplings may not have been shrimp.&nbsp; I&#39;m not really sure what was in them, but they aren&#39;t on the menu anymore, so I may have eaten something I didn&#39;t really want to eat (I don&#39;t eat mammals), but there was definitely a piece of shrimp in one of them.&nbsp; I&#39;m not asking questions and it was tasty all the same.&nbsp; I won&#39;t be ordering it again, &#39;cause it&#39;s not on the menu.<br /><br />The plain mai fun was... plain.&nbsp; It was a little dry, too, but I guess you get what you ask for.&nbsp; I knew I should have gone with the chow fun...<br /><br />Overall, it was probably the best chinese I&#39;ve had in astoria so far and will give it a shot again with my new menu.<br /><br />

				We tried Golden Kitchen last night (that&#039;s the one on Astoria Blvd, right?). It was okay, not amazing, but okay. We ordered the chicken with broccoli (pretty good -- the sauce wasn&#039;t overly oily), the cold sesame noodles (I liked them, my gf though they were meh), the veggie lo mein (very bland, not so good), plain fried rice (which really can&#039;t be screwed up), and spring rolls (ick). I&#039;d say it was maybe slightly better than Lily on 30th Avenue.<br /><br />I dunno, there hasn&#039;t been good Chinese in Astoria since Shanghai closed about a billion years ago.<br /><br />And FWIW, when we want sit-down Chinese, we go to Andy&#039;s on Montague Street in Brooklyn Heights... noodles and duck sauce on the table &#039;n everything.<br /><br />

				Oh good lord. I LOVE this place. It&#039;s on 31st between 23rd Ave. and Ditmars, and I&#039;m simply crazy about their broccoli with garlic sauce. The sauce is delicious, and I&#039;ve stood there and WATCH them stirfry my food before. They use perfectly fresh veggies, and they actually throw in some water chestnuts, carrots and mushrooms to the broccoli to spice things up a bit. And super cheap—I get out of there for $3.85 for a small, which is just enough to feed me until I&#039;m foodstupid. Great, greasy egg rolls, too, and my roommate loves their chicken and broccoli.<br />Mmm.<br />Phone number: 718-545-2228

				Just tried Sunrise on 34th and Broadway for the first time in many years (and the first time after the name changed a while ago).&nbsp; The food was very tasty and large portions were served.&nbsp; They have a large seating area and a pleasant atmosphere with a good view of people walking down Broadway.&nbsp; Good for a quick and cheap bite when you&#039;re in the mood for Chinese.<br /><br />Also, in Chinese restaurant news Wok and Roll (a/k/a Work and Roll depending on which sign you read) which is off the corner of 31st and Broadway is now called Top One.&nbsp; Has anyone noticed a difference in the food since the name change?

				related but not:&nbsp; <br /><br />I was just in the basement of a chinese restaurant (long story, don&#039;t ask - and no, it was not in Astoria) and they had BUCKETS of raw chicken sitting on the dirty floor with the front grate open to the street in the 90 degree weather.&nbsp; Now, I&#039;m not saying every chinese restaurant operates like that one but I bet many do.&nbsp; It will be a very long time before I order chinese food again, and I will NEVER order chicken.

				I agree thumbs up on Golden Kitchen (Astoria Blvd stop) but you have to order carefully. Their noodle soup and wonton soup I like because the broth seems to be homemade. Too salty tho. The wontons in it are great.<br /><br />I also really like their plain rice, which may sound strange, until you compare how their jasmine rice tastes compared to most joints&#039;. It makes a huge difference.<br /><br />The fried rice is good in all its incarnations and the shrimp egg roll is the best in Astoria, easily. <br /><br />Some of the other stuff is just average. I haven&#039;t had anything that was awful--just the usual goop and grease that usually signifies fast-food chinese.<br /><br />The people at the counter are nice and so are the delivery persons.<br /><br />There used to be a coupla places in Astoria that had a special &quot;chinese&quot; menu on its menu--as crazy as it sounds. It meant dim sum and other stuff (like jellyfish, beef tendon, etc) that wouldn&#039;t fly for most non-Asians. I mourn the passing of those places, and if anybody knows of a restaurant that is still doing that, please post. It&#039;s been a long time since I&#039;ve had drunk chicken delivered to my door.
