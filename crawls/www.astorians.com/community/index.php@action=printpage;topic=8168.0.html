				Vampires &gt; Chuck Norris<br /><br />As for my other battles:<br /><br />Bear - my logic on this one is about as valid (yet humorous) as my Jack Bauer is a vampire one, but I&#039;m sticking to it<br />Bumblebee - not only has a lazer, but can transform into a car, making him faster than Johnny 5.<br />Draw - Both sides destroyed by an unexpected Strawberry Shortcake drive by<br />Snorks - I always figured that the Snorks were like mer people, and that Hannah Barbera only showed us the cute side of them.&nbsp; I have no doubt that the Snorks could dismantle the necessary miniature SCUBA equipment necessary for this battle to take place and drown the Smurfs all at once, much to the dismay of Gargamel&#039;s taste buds.<br />Lohan - She&#039;s from lawn guy land and on cocaine.&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty sure she could take most professional wrestlers.
