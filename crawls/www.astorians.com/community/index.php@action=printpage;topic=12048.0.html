				Yesterday in our neck of the woods (Bway/Steinway xroads) saw hundreds of what appeared to be flying black ants (not wood or carpenter which are larger), though some of my neighbors seemed to think they were mosquitoes. They were covering all the cars on the block and flying (lazily) here and there, landing on people, dogs, everything. I am sticking to my black ant theory for now; I think they were making what some call a &quot;nuptial flight.&quot; Any entomologists in the house to set the record straight?

				Yeah, I had to deal with them when I walked around from Broadway and 48th Street to the Steinway area?&nbsp; One almost went in my mouth and one was on my eyeglasses.&nbsp; I thought it was just me, but I saw people waving their arms and hands around to get them away when I was walking west on B&#039;way.&nbsp;

				maybe termites?&nbsp; the reprodcing termites fly, look just like flying ants, and emerge once a year.&nbsp; they fly slow and aimlessly, not even avoiding predators who might eat them.

				Whatever they were (they looked like gnats to me) they grossed me out.&nbsp; It was like being in some creepy, bug horror movie.&nbsp; One flew into my eye and I practically inhaled another.&nbsp; They were all over my car and some dropped in every time I opened the door to get in or out.&nbsp; I hope it&#039;s safe to go out today.... :-(

				They&#039;re flying ants -- happens every year about this time when queen ants come out of their nests and begin the mating process to start new colonies. <br /><br />mronda you have it right:<br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_ant_day (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_ant_day)<br /><br />
