				Looks like Baru is closing! &nbsp;When I passed it this a.m. there was a sign announcing the re-opening of &quot;Park Kafe&quot;. &nbsp;I'm not sure what that's about since Rainbow Cafe is what it used to be. &nbsp;Hopefully this is a step in the right direction.

				My guess is that it is same owner and they are revamping. &nbsp;Probably will be similar to Plaza Lounge across the street. &nbsp;Can't believe that place survived as long as it did. &nbsp;BTW a sign on the door indicates the grand reopening will be Dec. 1st.

				i agree - i can't see putting up the money and effort to start a new business and giving up after a few months. &nbsp;plus they still seem to have the same chairs chained up outside - and they were open just a few days ago. &nbsp; plus a week or so between closing and opening suggests same owners.

				Good Aslan! I couldn't possibly list them all. The place is like France, but colder. <br /><br />Vermonters have institutionalized a respect for food like no place I've ever heard of beyond France. It's fabulous. Among my faves are Lake Champlain Chocolates, A Buffalo Mozzarella I forgot the name of, Major Farm cheese, Grafton 4/5 Star, and countless chedders. This past month was the Vermont Cheese Fest at Murray's. I'm sure they have lots in stock, still. They used to have a wonderful cheese called Orbweaver, but they stopped making cheese. Tragic. Cabot is hugely over-rated, but it's a co-op, so, not evil and corporate, at least. There's tons of stuff you'll never find here, too. Come visit, tho, and you'll get a taste of American Flatbread, Intervale produce, homemade maple syrup, Red Onion Cafe's Honey Oat bread, and on and on and on. <br /><br />Anyone still wondering why we're moving? =)

				iLoveCheese, where in Vermont are you moving? &nbsp;Some of my family lives in way, way northern Vermont, in the outskirts of Burlington and in East Hardwicke. &nbsp;They love it but I don't think I would want to live in such a remote area.<br /><br />Though Dakin Farm cheese is a nice consolation....

				Dakin Farms - yum!<br /><br />We're moving to Burlington - we are so psyched! Vermont <em>is </em>expensive, largely because so many New Yorkers are buying up real estate for vacation homes. Burlington is actually a City, tho a small one. But I wouldn't call it remote. Though there is remoteness in Vermont and if I thought we could find work out there, we might do it. <br /><br />Vermont is still very progressive compared to other states, but it's a farm state and has all the struggles of familiy farmers across the country. And there's conflict between punk over-educated liberal types like me moving into the state and the dairy farmers that have lived there for generations. In fact, I'm pretty much guaranteed to be considered a New Yorker for the rest of my life there. I have a lot of respect for farmers (and people who grew up in trailers) and I think the name of the game is respecting and trying to understand each other. Not calling each other names. I think one of the reasons I like Vermont so much is because the culture is so much different and more compassionate. But it's not perfect. Nothing is.

				Well, mostly 'cause we like it. I've been shopping around for a city to live in for a while, but it seemed like it was NYC, Europe or nowhere. But we visited and just really liked it. We can identify with the value system there more than here and it - to us - is a better place to have a kid. (No, I'm not pregnant.) We're both nuts for winter and outdoor recreation, too. <br /><br />I'm from Syracuse, New York and to me, Burlington has the best of Syracuse and New York in one.

				Having spent so many years in the West and near the Sierras etc, pretty much everything back here is flat in comparison. &nbsp;But I am slowly learning to appreciate these smaller, less imposing mountains here in the East. &nbsp;My guess is that these mountains like the Adirondacks and White are older than the Rockies or Sierras. &nbsp;But I'm not sure. &nbsp;Anyone know?

				I'm not 100% sure that they're older, but they certainly pale when comparing the size. Also, our mountains are mostly glacial and those out West are from tectonic movement. Ours are pretty, but truly, tiny hills compared to the Rockies. But this way we can actually reach peaks without taking a vacation from work!<br /><br />PS. Nectars - nice!

				Yeah, I went to New England Culinary Institute up there when I was getting tuition reimbursement from Suss MicroTec :) &nbsp;So I worked at the NECI restuarant on Church St. briefly, as much as my schedule would allow.<br /><br />I lived with two people who worked at Stone Soup on College St. &nbsp;That seemed like a cool place to work. &nbsp;The restaurant workers of Burlington are one big family, basically... they all seem to take care of their own. &nbsp;I felt like, in their eyes, I would never be a legitimate member of their family if I kept the high-paying corporate job so I kinda laid low in that scene, but occasionally worked as a saucier for a couple of places and a catering company outside of Burlington. &nbsp;I was trying to keep a low profile at the time.<br /><br />Plus, the girl I was living with at the time had a bakery stand at the Burlington Farmers Market, which was (in retrospect) really amazing. &nbsp;I just resented being woken up early in the morning to help her, but it was a really cool experience.

				oh, cool - thanks. I might be doing that for a while. Not sure yet. Did you know that that NECI restaurant on Church is going to be closed? I read in the paper that it was too successful and the students were having to work too much. Seems odd, huh? But we did really enjoy our meal there. You must work in some fancy NYC restaurant now!

				Hehe.. no... culinary school was something to enhance a hobby. &nbsp;I'm far from being a professional chef. &nbsp;Aside from lacking a lot of real world restaurant experience, I only got a two-year degree from NECI and miserably failed pâtissière and everything baking related. &nbsp;I'm a software engineer. &nbsp;The hours are better. &nbsp;:)
