				Don&#39;t know how many of you were around for this, but in 1999 Con Ed was blasted and sued by Guiliani for the massive blackout in Washington Hts.&nbsp; I remember this happening but not all the specifics.&nbsp; It was also mentioned in today&#39;s AM Daily, and our Queens pols are upset with Bloomberg over his high praise for Con Ed, and comparing it to Rudy&#39;s suing the company for what happened in 1999.<br /><br />I don&#39;t have time to research this til late tonight, but if anyone wants to do some research and find out how that blackout differs from this one and why Con Ed was sued back then, it would be greatly appreciated.

				I remember when this happened, and I think the Lower East Side had a blackout more recently (or was it part of the same blackout?).<br />I remember feeling terrible for the people, but you don&#39;t really know what it&#39;s like until you&#39;ve gone through it yourself.&nbsp; ConEd made a lot of promises that they would not let this happen again, but they have.

				Finally got around to doing this research.&nbsp; Apparently Con Ed learned nothing from the Washington Hts Blackout of 1999.&nbsp; These two articles are particularily enlightening, frustrating, and upsetting.&nbsp; Guiliani did sue them, but in the end the city did not fault Con Ed.&nbsp; Seems like they should have, this blackout is much worse than in 1999.<br /><br />Obviously none of Spitzer&#39;s recommendations were done - click on link to read whole report<br /><br />http://www.oag.state.ny.us/press/2000/mar/mar09a_00.html<br />QUIPMENT FLAWS AND WEAKNESSES CAUSED BLACKOUT IN WASHINGTON HEIGHTS /INWOOD AND OTHER AREAS LAST SUMMER<br />Spitzer Issues Report and Recommendations to Improve Reliability of Con Ed&#39;s Service<br /><br /><br />http://www.nyc.gov/html/om/html/99a/pr288-99.html<br />MAYOR GIULIANI AND CORPORATION COUNSEL MICHAEL HESS ANNOUNCE LAWSUIT AGAINST CON EDISON ON BEHALF OF CITY OF NEW YORK, ITS RESIDENTS AND THE BOARD OF EDUCATION<br />City Will Also File Complaint With Public Service Commission<br /><br />I&#39;d take Guiliani&#39;s handling of this over Bloomie&#39;s any day.

				And this is the entire report from 1999.<br /><br />http://www.oag.state.ny.us/telecommunications/blackout/coned.pdf<br /><br />If we are to assume the entire NYC grid is not on solid ground, why did we contine to increase the density and the demands on the system with more development?<br /><br />Can someone tell us who give the green light to ok more density, more demand on an electric system that it now seems all our officials are telling us they knew all along was weak?<br /><br />Did their actions knowingly put citizens in harm&#39;s way?
