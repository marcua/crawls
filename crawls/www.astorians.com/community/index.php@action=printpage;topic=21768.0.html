				Got a friend coming to town and she&#039;s looking forward to some live Greek music. Anybody have any idea? Someone mentioned Zodiac but aren&#039;t they closed? Prefer Astoria but if anyone knows of a place in the city that would be ok.

				Zodiac is long gone, but there are a few places that do live Greek music nearly every night.&nbsp; Jimbo&#039;s on Astoria Blvd between 29th and 31st Street and Friends (Filakia) on Ditmars, I think between 32nd and 34th Street.&nbsp; Typically misuc starts after 10-ish and is cranking by midnight.&nbsp; Filakia is drinks only Jimbos has food (suprisingly very good food, too)

				Thanks for the info.&nbsp; My friend postponed her trip for a later date but before I knew that I walked over to Jimbos one night and all I saw were old timers like folks in there 50&#039;s and up. I guess all the ones where all the young people in Astoria used to go closed down.&nbsp; I found two places in Manhattan though Lafayette Grill and Rafina so I hope they are pretty good.

				Lafayette grill is more grungy, but their repertoire is more Balkan, not only Greek. Always had a blast there. It&#039;s lively. Rafina is more upscale, and also caters to the older crowd. Good times have been had there too. Jimbos can be more exciting though if you can look past the &quot;old timers&quot;. <br /><br />Most live Greek music places don&#039;t draw younger crowds anymore. The younger generation mostly frequents the cafes, bars, lounges, clubs. <br /><br /><br />I would suggest starting at a place in the city, and ending up at Jimbos or Filarakia, that way you can see for yourself the differences. Also the Astoria places tend to get busy later on in the night.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Rafinas is a great place . The owner now has a brand new location and the place looks amazing . It is a little pricy but the food and music is great .

				Thanks for the sugestions guys! I found another spot called Ammos in Manhattan and also Laterna Taverna out on Bell Blvd Bayside. So Rafina,Lafayette and Jimbos is a good start.

				Totally forgot about Ammos. Another good spot, more upscale than Rafina though.

				actually had our wedding rehearsal dinner @ Laternas.&nbsp; They&#039;re nice owners &amp; good food.&nbsp; More low key/conservative than Jimbos or Fialakia, but good.&nbsp;
