				<br />I broke down and finally bought a digital camera. I don&#39;t know how they can call one of these things point-and-shoot. It came with 130 page guide. I have a wedding to go to in July. One of those ostentatious 4-day, Hollywod-type affairs! I wanted to take a better camera than the one I have been using for the past 20 years—a 35mm point-and-shoot similar to the one one Harlan is parting with—except my Chinon has a 30–60mm zoom lens.<br /><br />I bought a &nbsp;Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ7. (http://www2.panasonic.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/vModelDetail?storeId=15001&amp;catalogId=13401&amp;itemId=96063&amp;catGroupId=24999&amp;modelNo=DMC-FZ7S&amp;surfModel=DMC-FZ7S&amp;cacheProgram=11002&amp;cachePartner=7000000000000005702) I actually went out of my, and spent far more than I had planned, to get a camera with decent optical zoom range. I know that the wedding couple have already directed their phograper and videographer *not* to pay special attention to public figures. But, I thought it would be great fun to get informal shots of some celebrities to bring home and share with my friends.<br /><br />I&#39;ve had the camera for a week now, and am no further along in getting saveable pictures than I was on day one.<br /><br />Any guidance, suggestions and help would be most gratefully and graciously appreciated.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Good choice! I got the similar Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ20 (http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/panasonicfz20/)! <br /><br />What sorts of problems are you having? Focus? Color? Brightness? If you set it on &quot;P&quot; and auto-focus you should get reasonably good pictures, assuming you have good light. The built-in flash is (like all built-in flashes) pretty harsh, and I&#39;d avoid it if you can. The best sunlight is in the last few hours before sunset, not during mid-day.<br /><br />Oh, one tip is to go into the menus and set the &quot;white balance&quot; to &quot;Cloudy&quot;, even if it&#39;s sunny. You&#39;ll get warmer pictures that way. <br /><br />Otherwise, use the zoom, make sure the subject of what you&#39;re shooting fills the frame, keep the sun behind you, and take lots of pictures!<br /><br />If you can show particular problems you&#39;re having, someone might be able to make specific suggestions.... You might try Flikr (http://www.flikr.com) or Zooomr (http://www.zooomr.com/) as places to host photos for you...<br /><br />Enjoy the camera!<br />

				Thanks for the tips. The flash is such crap. It drowns out everything. <br /><br />Ok, Harlan. I&#39;m going to set it to P instead of the heart (auto). Then to cloudy, insteady of all the other stuff I tried.<br /><br />I&#39;ve had trouble with focus, authentic color and getting sharp detail.<br /><br />I&#39;ll play some more tomorrow with the new settings, and also look into Flikr or Zooomr.

Oh, you could try to change the ISO to 400, if the camera allows, which will get you better color and faster exposures indoors, at the cost of some graininess in the resulting image...<br /><br />Anyone else have any suggestions?

Everyone told me that outdoors it is a lot easier to get good color and quality, so I am focusing on indoors. Every 24 (or so) months I take pictures of my residence for insurance purposes. I shoot every nook and cranny. Open closets and cabinets so that the contents can be viewed. I usually use two rolls of 36 shots of 35mm. Pick out the best, and keep them with the insurance policy after I scan them and replace the ones from the last time. Harlan, I can&#39;t get a single shot. I am getting frustrated. I tried taking pictures of my dogs. One is all white the other is all black. Forget about using the flash. They look like cartoon characters! The white one comes out yellow(ish) and the black one shows me very little detail. I&#39;ve tried using any available natural indoor lighting. Nothing seems to work. Does that mean that this expensive toy cannot be used for indoor use? I know nothing about external flash, and what the heck is a hot light?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=2246.msg15441.html#msg15441">Quote from: Harlan on June 01, 2006, 12:08:36 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">No, don&#39;t reduce the megapixels.

				Hi nycmac.. Read the chapter on White balance. Some cameras are good at compensating for white balance but others just don&#39;t do the camera justice. Back in the days of film, you would have to change the film for indoor shots with tungsten lighting. Can you shoot raw with that camera? I suggest shooting raw for a bit, try to figure out which wb setting works best indoors and go with that. Also the more you zoom (longer focal length) the less light that comes in through the lens.&nbsp; <br /><br />One more bit.. Try the foil trick. Doesn&#39;t always work and it&#39;s a bit awkward but it might suit your needs on occation.. take a 5x5 cardbord stock and cover it in aluminun. Use the board to reflect the flash to the cieling. (low ceilings only). This the diffuses the light and gets rid of a lot of harsh shadows.<br />

				Quick White balance summary:&nbsp; White balance is how the camera accounts for different color temperatures.&nbsp; When the sun sets the colors look warm.. when you are in the shade the colors look cool or more blue. Anyway.. Most cameras have an auto white balance (AWB), some even give you the option of changing the WB. Take a picture in the shade with no flash.. Then take the same picture by changing the WB from AWB to shade.. Take the same picture.. You will notice that the color with the correct wb will look more natural as you saw it. <br /><br />Since you will be shooting indoors, and with a flash, you might want to take a couple of test shots to see which one works best in those lighting conditions.<br /><br />Glad to see you tried the foil trick.. There is another part to that trick that I didn&#39;t think you would need but It sounds like it might be important to know. Since the light is taking a detour, going to the cieling then back down to your subject, it takes longer to get there. The camera still thinks the flash is going in a straight line so it&#39;s going to open and close the shutter quickly. Too fast unfortunately for all the light to reach the subject, hence the dark picture. So to account for this. adjust the exposure compensation to overexpose by a 1/2 a stop. This should take care of it.<br /><br />If I completely confused you..Try www.photo.net
