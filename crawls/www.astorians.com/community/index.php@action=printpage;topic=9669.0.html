				I just joined and found out that TEACHERS get a pretty decent discount...$45/month as opposed to their current $58/month.&nbsp; It&#039;s a definite upgrade from Fitness Point.&nbsp; I was just getting tired of the dirty/broken machines and yes, I&#039;m aware of the &quot;get what you pay for&quot; philosophy.

I only saw someone in it once and I have no idea what is was or what it did, then it magically disappeared, I figured cuz no one was using it. Maybe this was the sauna?<br /><br />(I don&#039;t really know what a sauna is)

				A sauna and a steam room are two different things.&nbsp; A sauna is dry heat and a steam room is wet heat.&nbsp; The steam room is there, and I use it.&nbsp; But there is no sauna.&nbsp;

				I know this post is kinda old but thought I&#039;d add to it.&nbsp; Just joined up yesterday and really like it.&nbsp; REALLY clean place.&nbsp; Very laid back atmosphere and as I&#039;m not a gym guy I appreciate the fact that there are no meatheads &quot;owning&quot; the place.&nbsp; So far so good.&nbsp; <br /><br />Grubic.

Synergy and Dolphins are tied together, at one time they were one corporation.&nbsp; &nbsp; The Synergy on Broadway near Crescent street originally opened as a Dolphins, signed everyone to low priced contracts that were renewable for life.&nbsp; Some&nbsp; &nbsp;months after they opened, they changed name to Synergy, said contracts were no longer valid, and tried to jack up rates on everyone who wanted to renew.&nbsp; If Fitness Point had not opened around the corner, they would have had more people stuck.&nbsp; <br /><br />Synergy has the most Consumer Affairs complaints per gym of any franchise in New York.&nbsp; Bally&#039;s is first overall, but per gym it&#039;s Synergy/Dolphins.

				I hear you on the lying thing in a way. I just remembered that they used to be 24 hours when they first opened, then cdecided to close at 11 or so due to &#039;remodeling&#039; als I heard they were trying to buy the upstairs space to install a pool. I actually believed that one.

				They close @ 11:00 pm on Fridays, used to be 10pm. They should really update their website or door signs, it leads members to believe they are open 24 hrs. Fridays. You know how many times i&#039;ve seen them turn people away on a Friday night or literally kick them out, shutting off lights, turning off music...
