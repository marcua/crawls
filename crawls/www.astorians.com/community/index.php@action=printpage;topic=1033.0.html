				Title: <strong>More on this...</strong><br />

				Monday, November 07th 2005 1200 hours will see the kick-off of a series (if the gods are willing) of weekly events centering around the free (in both senses of the word) information that is available about technology and the culture of technology.<br />&lt;BR&gt;(in this particular case, PoDcasts)<br /><br />The original idea was started by Windowsrefund when he attempted to spark interest by gathering an audience together at the Peach to listen to the Massachusetts hearing on OpenDocument Format (http://astorians.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=870) which was considerately downloaded, burned &amp; supplied by CritterNYC who was currently working on a project called Portable Firefox at the time. I guess alot of the people coming into the cafe' didn't realize what was going on hence the idea of introducing a large sandwich :-) It was originally going to be 4 feet, then (at the advice of a friend) became 8 feet, but due to the impractical nature of such a large sandwich, I think that we are going to settle for two (2) four (4) foot heroes with the promise of drunken rewards for those of us who delight in such things afterwards (to counteract the healthy nature of the sandwich in the name of Balancing the Equation &lt;/smirk&gt;) The idea was further given the breath of life by Frozenfroot who thought that such an event would be good on a weekly basis. Hopefully Merm will give me a hand with the sandwiches!<br /><br />To tell you the truth though, I am not expecting a large turn-out. It was decided that Monday's at 12pm was usually the slowest time of the week, which is o.k. with me because we will be trying to listen to spoken word with undivided attention anyhow. It doesn't matter though what the turn out is, it is enough that the event takes place, and that consistently, from week to week, information being exchanged and yet another time-slot in the year where like-minded individuals can find haven. Between the Cons, the various computer clubs and user groups there should be no day in the year where one can't find or communicate knowledge by speaking to a live individual face-to-face when one needs to get up and away from the computer screen for awhile.<br /><br />I chose Binary Revolution Radio for several reasons. The creator, Stank Dawg is very entertaining in addition to being highly informed. He is 1337 yet not &quot;elitist&quot;. A very down to earth personality who emanates intelligence and humanity; I just like listening to him. I chose this particular episode because I think the science of Cryptology has been getting much attention lately from the general public given the popular craze surrounding books as The DaVinci Code and the success of such movies like Enigma &amp; National Treasure, and the mystery that surrounds and fascinates all who come into knowledge or contact with the sculpture of Kryptos. I also think (on a socially conscious level) that the time is now ripe for people who are concerned about their privacy in their personal day-to-day communications, whether it be by email or videophone to take hold of the reigns of simple technological solutions that are easily within the grasp of every man, woman and child, and to use these tools which is our human birthright to begin laying a sound pavement along the long and glorious road to freedom.<br /><br />Well, anyway, get your pencils and papers ready &amp; here are some sites you might want to have handy in near future...<br /><br />http://elonka.com/kryptos/<br />http://www.binrev.com/radio/archive.php?p=5<br />http://members.aol.com/nova1337/tutorial.htm<br />http://www.phreaknic.info/pn9/<br /><br />What follows is the Phreaknik challenge which Elonka cracked, she uses this code in a tutorial that some of us will be following:<br />http://members.aol.com/nova1337/phreaknic.txt<br /><br />(http://www.spacestationx.com/projector/cp-Thumbnails/16.jpg)<br /><span style="font-size: 9px;" class="bbc_size">Cyrillic Projector (http://www.spacestationx.com/projector/cp.html)</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 7px;" class="bbc_size">OMN1SCAN</span>
