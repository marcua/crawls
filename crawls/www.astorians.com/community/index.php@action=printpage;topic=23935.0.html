				Is it only me or any of you noticed that as soon as you turn into Q plaza with the NQ trains the cell and data signal goes down?<br />shouldn&#039;t be the best served spot in Astoria?<br />Jussain&#039;...<br /><br /><br />Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk HD

				There&#039;s long standing dead zone between QBP and 39th Ave. My T-Mobile &amp; Sprint phones always had a problem here. Is strange because there are a number of cell towers visible on the buildings in this area.

				I&#039;ve experienced connectivity issues pulling around the corner into Queensboro Plaza.&nbsp; Hopefully one of the local business associations does a free wifi program eventually - like the one they just did in Chelsea.

And I know Queensboro Plaza was a wasteland some time ago, and in some way is still is problems ridden, but it&#039;s also a place of new endeavor and development and it&#039;s always being a crucible for transportation, public and private. I can&#039;t understand why the major TC companies didn&#039;t aggressively improved coverage and even offered hotspot for thousands and thousands of potential and actual customers passing by every day. <br /><br /><br />Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk HD

But I have also had a work-issued Blackberry since 2006 through first Cingular and now AT&amp;T. Now that you mention it, I realise that my signal issues have mostly related to data, so I probably conflated the two. I think I&#039;ve never had a significant problem calling or texting anyone on my Verizon phone, now or in the past (regardless of whether it was a smartphone or not). I&#039;d say with regard to data, the AT&amp;T unit gets worse reception than the Verizon unit, although they are made by different companies so have different receptor capacities.

				I had AT&amp;T and would always get my calls dropped in this area.&nbsp; I switched to Verizon 2 years ago and its better, although the signal does get weaker and internet is VERY slow on my phone in that area.

				I have Verizon and Thought I was the only one having this problem.&nbsp; Typically as I approach QBP, I can see my LTE bars drop.&nbsp; By the time I leave 36th Ave station, I usually have 2 bars, which drops down to one by the time I reach 39th.&nbsp; After 39th it is a mobile signal dead zone, until I come back above ground in the city.&nbsp; If I&#039;m lucky, on occasion I will get 3G signal in QBP, but even then it tends to be weak.

				Must be something new.&nbsp; I have Verizon and had to buy a signal extender that actually uses the internet connection.&nbsp; It works well but is very pricy.

				Well, what about all these cable companies that promise you hotspots wherever you go if you log into your account? I don&#039;t see those working either. It&#039;s like this &quot;dead zone&quot; is a geographic no man zone for anybody who could provide service. I think there must be a reason, like some kind of shady deal made years ago to keep these providers away.

				It&#039;s because we live in the United States.&nbsp; If you want better cell service, go anywhere but here.&nbsp;
