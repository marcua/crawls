				Refrigerator Will Toss You Can of Beer<br />&nbsp;<br />From Associated Press<br />March 08, 2007 4:04 PM EST <br />RALEIGH, N.C. - When John Cornwell graduated from Duke University last year, he landed a job as software engineer in Atlanta but soon found himself longing for his college lifestyle. So the engineering graduate built himself a reminder of life on campus: a refrigerator that can toss a can of beer to his couch with the click of a remote control.<br /><br />&quot;I conceived it right after I got out,&quot; said Cornwell, a May 2006 graduate from Huntington, N.Y. &quot;I missed the college scene. It embodies the college spirit that I didn&#039;t want to let go of.&quot;<br /><br />It took the 22-year-old Cornwell about 150 hours and $400 in parts to modify a mini-fridge common to many college dorm rooms into the beer-tossing contraption, which can launch 10 cans of beer from its magazine before needing a reload.<br /><br />With a click of the remote, fashioned from a car&#039;s keyless entry device, a small elevator inside the refrigerator lifts a beer can through a hole and loads it into the fridge&#039;s catapult arm. A second click fires the device, tossing the beer up to 20 feet - &quot;far enough to get to the couch,&quot; he said.<br /><br />Is there a foam explosion when the can is opened? Not if the recipient uses &quot;soft hands&quot; to cradle the can when caught, Cornwell said.<br /><br />In developing his beer catapult, Cornwell said he dented a few walls and came close to accidentally throwing a can through his television. He&#039;s since fine-tuned the machine to land a beer where he usually sits at home, on what he called &quot;a right-angle couch system.&quot;<br /><br />For now, the machine throws only cans, although Cornwell has thought about making a version that can throw a bottle. The most beer he has run through the machine was at a party, when he launched a couple of 24-can cases.<br /><br />&quot;I did launch a lot watching the Super Bowl,&quot; he said. &quot;My friends are the reason I built it. I told them about the idea and hyped it so much and I had to go through with it.&quot;<br /><br />A video featuring the device is a hit on the Internet, where more than 600,000 people have watched it at metacafe.com, earning Cornwell more than $3,000 from the Web site.<br /><br />Cornwell said he has talked to a brewing company about the machine, but right now only one exists. Asked if he might start building some for sale, he said: &quot;I&#039;m keeping that option open, depending on interest.&quot;<br /><br />When Cornwell was a student at Duke - an elite, private university in Durham - he participated in the engineering school&#039;s robotic basketball contests, said mechanical engineering Professor Bob Kielb. He said students tried to build a robot that could retrieve a pingpong ball and toss it into a small hoop.<br /><br />&quot;He always did well in it,&quot; Kielb said. &quot;He came up with completely unique ideas.&quot;<br /><br />---<br /><br />On the Net:<br /><br />Cornwell&#039;s Web Site: http://www.duke.edu/jwc13/index.html%emph_off<br /><br />
