				Hello.&nbsp; I&#039;m in the Broadway area and I&#039;m new on this board.&nbsp; My son is in 5th grade and we will be starting the middle school application process this year. I was wondering if anyone else is in the same boat or currently has a child in a public middle school.&nbsp; We are zoned for I.S. 126 but I understand we can put other district 30 middle schools down as choices.&nbsp; &nbsp;How are the middle schools in Astoria, specifically 126, 141, 10 and 204?&nbsp; Any information would be helpful!&nbsp; Thanks.

				Hello,<br /><br />Yes, we are in the same situation this year. My son is in 5th Grade and am not sure where he will go next year. I&#039;ve been on the board of ed website checking out the statistics of the schools we are considering and the &quot;grades&quot; that they have been given on their annual reports. That is a good starting point. They also tell you what activities, etc. the school provides. Right now we are thinking about 10, 141 and louis armstrong. It is a difficult decision because he may have to come home by himself, etc.<br /><br />BG30

				Hello! I have also been looking at the DOE website and also insideschools.org which is very helpful, but they do not provide information as to the safety and reputation of the schools as other parents might.&nbsp; I have heard negative things about 126 and am concerned for my son&#039;s safety if he doesn&#039;t get any of his choices and has to go there.&nbsp; I wonder is it really that bad? On the other hand I hear that 141 is very good.&nbsp; As for 10 and 204 I don&#039;t know much about them.&nbsp; &nbsp;It would be really great to know what others have heard or from parents themselves whose children attend these schools.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am also concerned about the traveling part.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;:|

				See you never can know for sure until you&#039;re there... I heard that 141 was not that great anymore - lots of fights. As for 204, i went there, although that was a very long time ago and it was horrible. My girlfriend&#039;s daughter went graduated maybe 2 years ago and said it was still bad. Unfortunately i think this may have to be a trial and error thing - not that i want to take him in and out of schools. But I also believe that school is what you make it if you are in a school that has pros and cons.

				I know what you mean about not knowing what the school is really like until you&#039;re there.&nbsp; But from what I&#039;ve read, they make it very difficult to transfer schools once you&#039;re in, even if the school is on the in need of improvement list which worries me.&nbsp; This is so stressful!&nbsp; Well good luck to you...I appreciate your input and anything more you or other parents might like to add.<br /><br />&nbsp;
