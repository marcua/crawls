				I want to believe that it took way too long for this movie to be made.<br /><br />I want to believe that people are not interested in seeing a movie made of a tv show that nobody is even remotely interested in anymore.<br /><br />I want to believe that Mulder will impregnate Scully and that their love child will look like a mixture between E.T. and Jessica Simpson.<br /><br />I want to believe that I will not be going to see this movie, even when it comes out on dvd unless they show it on FX first.<br /><br />

				Yeah, my friends and I (all long time Philes, of course&nbsp; :mrgreen:) are seeing it in Manhattan as well.&nbsp; It&#039;s more to do with the fact that we live all over city than anything else, but i have to say that I&#039;m disappointed that the movie isn&#039;t opening in some of my favorite theaters like the Union Sq. one. <br /><br />And Billz, yes the movie is going to be of the &quot;monster of the week&quot; variety.&nbsp; They&#039;re doing this to avoid the hurty-head-ness that comes with the mythology.&nbsp; It seems like a smart move.&nbsp; But really, I will happily admit that all I&#039;m really in it for is for the &#039;ship.&nbsp; As long as we get some kind of Mulder-Scully lovin&#039; I&#039;ll be a happy camper. <br /><br />Oh, and listening to Billy Connolly talk is icing on the cake.

				I&#039;m afraid it&#039;s gotten some lackluster reviews, but I don&#039;t care; I&#039;m a fan so I want to see it on the big screen, but I&#039;m might do the Astoria matinee and save a few $$.

				I just have to go see it.&nbsp; Was a huge fan of the show but disappointed with the 1st movie. Still have some hope for the 2nd one.&nbsp; Aliens and for Scully to see AND remember the incident. Is that too much to ask???&nbsp;

				&nbsp;:rock:<br />yay! the movie was awesome!<br /><br />what was a little unsettling was how empty the theatre was. I was at the 1010 at kaufman and it wasn&#039;t packed. I mean, there were people, but like the entire row in front of ours was empty, there was one couple in the row behind us, and the sides were almost completely empty. <br />I hope it doesn&#039;t tank too bad ...

				Our movie theater wasn&#039;t even half way filled.&nbsp; We were at the 9:50pm at the CC Cinema Village Theater on 11th and 2nd Ave.&nbsp; BTW, don&#039;t go there!&nbsp; They A/C isn&#039;t working, so the theater was stuffy and warm.&nbsp; It was cooler outside. Blah!<br /><br />And I have to say, I was really disappointed in the movie.&nbsp; I turned to my friends afterwards and said, &quot;I think Chris Carter let some fan fic writers write this.&quot;&nbsp; Ugh.&nbsp; The X-File case was incredibly weak, and was the plotting leading up to the reveal.&nbsp; &nbsp;Scully&#039;s subplot was stupid.&nbsp; And the &#039;ship was just weird.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m sad.&nbsp; I really, really wanted to <del>believe</del> like this.
