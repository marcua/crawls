				Well, I got an offer from Chris, but I'd still like to know if there is anyone who has had a good experience with a trustworthy and expert computer-repair business in the area, or even a bad experience with a business I should avoid.<br /><br />A few years ago New York Magazine had a horror story about an unscrupulous Mac repair place in the city. &nbsp;I'm not likely to patronize them, since I have a PC-type computer, but it brought home the danger of playing Russian roulette with one's computer.<br /><br />And Chris, I appreciate your offer, but I don't know you any better than I know the local stores. &nbsp;You understand, don't you? &nbsp;:|

				Thanx, Zeno. &nbsp;I tried to reply last night, but maybe it's a sign of how my computer is messed up that the reply never got posted.<br /><br />Looking at the packing slip, I find that my computer is still in warranty, so I'll try to contact Dell first. &nbsp;But it's good to know of a good local place in case Dell can't help me.<br /><br />I think there's something evil on my hard drive, eating files, slowing the system to a crawl, forcing me to reboot every 15 minutes, usually by turning off the surge protector, and disabling all the security programs. &nbsp;I can still access the security Websites, so thank God for small mercies.

				Could be any number of things. I&#39;d recommend finding a new computer, that you know works, then plugging the old drive into the new computer. That way you don&#39;t have to boot off the old drive, or use the old hardware, in case there are problems with either some segments of the old drive, or any part of the rest of the old computer. The only way you wouldn&#39;t be able to get the data off the old drive then is if the drive itself failed catastrophically, which is possible but not as likely as something getting misconfigured or some other failure... <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=890.msg25285.html#msg25285">Quote from: afarber on August 15, 2006, 05:23:28 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I too am looking for help with my computer.&nbsp; I&#39;m somewhat computer, savy, but I just need a quick, cheap fix.&nbsp; I am getting rid of my very old desktop PC, and I&#39;m having trouble getting it to boot up.&nbsp; It starts too, but after recognizing my drives, it just freezes.&nbsp; All I want to do is get my resume off it!<br /><br />Any thoughts?<br /><br />Thanks so much!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I wouldn&#39;t recommend Windows Me either, because it&#39;s no longer supported by Microsoft.&nbsp; As for a floppy drive, if you can&#39;t get it as an option on a desktop (they&#39;re on the Dimension 3100 computers in this Internet cafe) you can get an external floppy drive.&nbsp; At least I hope&nbsp; :| because floppies are what I&#39;ve saved my favorite files to.&nbsp; <br /><br />Afarber, can you boot up in Safe mode?&nbsp; If you can, you can copy your resume to a disk.&nbsp; That&#39;s my situation.&nbsp; I can no longer boot up in Normal mode, but I have been copying my favorite files in Safe mode.<br /><br />

				&quot;ladywithpans&quot;&nbsp; My suggest is if your computer is within warranty, let Dell fix it.&nbsp; Believe me, there will be enough to worry about when you warranty runs out.&nbsp; (I used to work phone tech support for Gateway...ohhhh do I have stories!).&nbsp; And as far as I&#39;m aware Dell does pretty well with their warranties.&nbsp; Do you have any idea what is wrong with your computer, whether it is a software or hardware issue, if it would even be covered under warranty?&nbsp;

				Two bits and a quick hijack.&nbsp; I had a nasty virus on my PC that was killing the boot sequence. I also had 6 months worth of my kids pictures on the Drive. I took out the HD and swapped it with a new one..Worked like a charm. Updated my virus definitions and turned the old one into a portable hardrive using a $40 kit. Now I have almost 500 gb of HD space, the virus was squashed, and the pictures were saved. <br /><br />I forgot what the second bit was.<br /><br />Hijack: I have a think pad laptop that WAS top of the line back in the late 90&#39;s. I would like to use it to do some work at Starbuckos but it&#39;s got some serious speed issues.. Is it worth upgrading?

				Well, here I am three years later.&nbsp; I have a new computer after almost 2 years of being computerless and living the life of a nomad (there&#039;s an Internet cafe that knows me well).<br /><br />Now I have a new computer, with a floppy drive.&nbsp; They really come in handy--for files from your old computer, or when you&#039;re between computers and are working on a document, or to take a document for printing when your own printer isn&#039;t working.<br /><br />But my troubles aren&#039;t over.&nbsp; After trying like mad to solve the problem of frequent freezes, I&#039;ve gotten the Dell phone technician&#039;s opinion that my hard drive is a lemon and needs to be replaced.&nbsp; That means backing it up.&nbsp; Especially since I intentionally bought one with Windows XP and you can&#039;t get that OS anymore.&nbsp; The phone help said that the HD replacement will be done by a person from Dell, but the backup will have to be done by a local computer shop.<br /><br />So now I&#039;d like an updated answer to my three-year-old question:&nbsp; Can anyone recommend a good computer repair shop in Astoria?&nbsp; Or at least disrecommend a bad one?

				despite your love of floppy drives, my recommendation to you would be to get a small portable hard drive, or a large USB drive - depending on how many files you need to backup. copy them to the hard drive/USB stick, then have Dell replace the old hard drive, and copy them back to the laptop.

				If you&#039;re having a lot of freezes (I was), it sounds like you need a check up and maybe a tune up.&nbsp; I found a great place called TA PC Repair.&nbsp; Number 347-242-3895.&nbsp; Almir owns &amp; runs it.&nbsp; Just opened.&nbsp; For about $70 he completely cleaned up my pc and installed an updated Windows + new security.&nbsp; Now my computer is really speedy &amp; never crashes.&nbsp; I forgot the exact address but it&#039;s somewhere over around 35th Avenue &amp; Broadway (I think it&#039;s Broadway).&nbsp; And he only takes cash.

				Murph,<br /><br />I&#039;m not talking about backing up <em>drives</em> to floppies--that&#039;s crazy.&nbsp; When I say I like a floppy drive, I&#039;m talking about copying <em>individual files,</em>, like Word documents, to move them between computers, or when you&#039;re working on a file on someone else&#039;s computer and shouldn&#039;t be leaving the file there.<br /><br />That&#039;s why I like to have a floppy drive on my console.&nbsp; When I ordered my new console I ordered one with a floppy drive.&nbsp; And if I ever have to replace the console I have, I&#039;ll want a floppy drive on the new console; it&#039;s so much more convenient than an external floppy drive.<br /><br />Now I have to back up my hard drive, and that&#039;s a different story.<br /><br />And Rene, are you talking about 35th Street and Broadway?&nbsp; And who&#039;s Almir?&nbsp;

Floppy&#039;s are convenient...but heading for extinction. lots of laptops skip them. they are optional on Dell desktops. they don&#039;t hold a lot of data and aren&#039;t very durable. documents will fit, but if you needed to move a couple of photos or a MP3, it just wouldn&#039;t fit.<br /><br />USB keys are very similar to floppy&#039;s, with native WinXP/Mac/Linux support, bigger capacity, and can just be thrown in a bag or pocket without worry of damage.<br /><br />depending on how much stuff you need to back up - you could fit it on a large USB key, otherwise my other suggestion of a portable hard drive would work.

				I think murph is talking about a flash drive - something like this (http://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Cruzer-Micro-Flash-SDCZ6-4096-A11/dp/B000NWVAFO/ref=pd_bbs_sr_3?ie=UTF8&amp;s=electronics&amp;qid=1215446946&amp;sr=8-3).&nbsp; They are much sturdier and more compact than a floppy disk, and any computer that has a USB port (which is all of them now) can use one.&nbsp; You use it just like a floppy, to copy individual files to backup or transfer from computer to computer - but it even fits on your keyring.&nbsp; Not only that, it holds much, much more data (the one I linked to holds 4 GB -- that&#039;s 4096 MB, whereas a floppy holds only 1.44 MB of data).

				Good to know about the little Flash drive--that&#039;s something I missed, and it sure beats carrying a CD around for something like an MP3 file.<br /><br />Now about that HD backup ...<br /><br />ETA: Right now I have an external HD sitting on my desk but it&#039;s useless without software.&nbsp; It&#039;s from the days when I had the old computer with Windows Me, the one that went to computer heaven.&nbsp; I never used the HD and I had no success in registering the software.&nbsp; I&#039;m trying to get the right software, and I just e-mailed the hardware manufacturer.&nbsp; <br /><br />Most of my new computer&#039;s HD is still unused; I wonder if what I have, including Windows XP, will fit on the external HD?<br /><br />I notice that Growing Technologies (is that the name?) is still around, tho its Website is under construction and inaccessible.&nbsp; Any other recommendations?

				Thank you, rene.<br /><br />As for the flash drive, if all you&#039;re going to move is a small document or two or three, I&#039;m still for a floppy.&nbsp; I saw the reviews of flash drives on Amazon, and it seems that so much can go wrong with them that they&#039;re an unnecessary complication, like an electric can opener.&nbsp; If I want to transport a music file, I think I&#039;ll use a CD.

				Well, here it is over 2 years later and I&#039;m warming to the wonders of USB flash drives, tho I haven&#039;t had occasion to use one yet.&nbsp; But now my question is:<br /><br />The console for my old desktop system is sitting zombie-like in my computer room because I cannot erase the old HD--the thing is unusable by me but it may be usable by an identity thief.&nbsp; I would like the HD to be overwritten locally because the **** console is so heavy to transport.&nbsp; <br /><br />How is TA PC Repair?&nbsp; I can get there without much difficulty.&nbsp; Is it trustworthy enough to overwrite a hard drive?

				If you are up to the challenge, there is a CD called Darik&#039;s Boot and Nuke<br />http://www.dban.org/<br /><br />It does one thing (and does it well)...it boots up and wipes your hard drive. 3 times by default if I&#039;m not mistaken. 100% free.

				No go, murph--DIY solutions are not for me.&nbsp; My old console is in no condition to boot up or run software.&nbsp; But the HD, I&#039;m sure, can still yield its secrets to some tech wizard who knows how to mine them.&nbsp; I need a good wizard to erase the data before some evil wizard gets to them, IOW, I need a pro.<br /><br />So I ask: can I trust TA PC?

Then you can trash the whole thing safely.

				Smashing the hard drive is a possibility.&nbsp; But what if I want to be a good citizen and recycle the console?&nbsp; Is there any computer pro in Astoria (preferably southern Astoria) trustworthy enough to wipe a HD?

				Quite rarely is a computer ever worth fixing at a local computer repair place. Hopefully they don&#039;t take advantage of you. If you need advice drop me a PM and I&#039;ll keep it from happening. <br />
