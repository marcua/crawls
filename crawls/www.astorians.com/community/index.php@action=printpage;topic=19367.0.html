As I think of hairy sweaty balls.....while watching porn......jerking off to porn. <br /><br />Oh you poor child..... you want to be a Senator based on a study&nbsp; of my masturbation habits......<br /><br />That is your platform?<br /><br />Well, I guess it is time to put in my disc of hairy ass men.....and watch them stroke and slam each other as I watch you lose an election while I masterbate. <br /><br />Oh.....what a scene<br /><br />MASTERBATION O&#039;DONNEL....That is the future of America<br />

				Nope....really loving the fact that the chances of the GOP capturing the Senate, according to Nick at 538, just dropped from 30% to 15%.<br /><br />And the best part....Karl Rove said as much on Fox News. <br /><br />Or do you mean the porn bubble I live in......<br /><br />Someone once said Greed is Good......<br /><br />I say Porn is good...... :evil:

All they require is enough reliable votes to consistently sustain a filibuster, and do not need to win ten Senate seats to get that.<br /><br />Well, keep &quot;really loving&quot; that.&nbsp; Small victories are still victories, I suppose.

				Her morality is so absolute that she would have sold out Anne Frank....becuase lying is that wrong.<br /><br />For the record....before QMC attacks me....I feel that Chrisopher Hitchen&#039;s absolute atheism is on the same level....anyway, the quote....<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Comedian Eddie Izzard pressed her on just how far she would take her anti-lying beliefs. Izzard asked O’Donnell whether or not she would lie to Nazis who showed up at her door during WWII and demanded to know if she were hiding any Jewish people in her house. O’Donnell refused to even entertain the notion of concealing the truth from Nazis in that scenario because “you never have to practice deception”:<br /><br />O’DONNELL: A lie, whether it be a lie or an exaggeration, is disrespect to whoever you’re exaggerating or lying to, because it’s not respecting reality.<br /><br />MAHER: Quite the opposite, it can be respect.<br /><br />IZZARD: What if someone comes to you in the middle of the Second World War and says, ‘do you have any Jewish people in your house?’ and you do have them. That would be a lie. That would be disrespectful to Hitler.<br /><br />O’DONNELL: I believe if I were in that situation, God would provide a way to do the right thing righteously. I believe that!<br /><br />MAHER: God is not there. Hitler’s there and you’re there.<br /><br />O’DONNELL: You never have to practice deception. God always provides a way out.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />
