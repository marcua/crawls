				This is completely random but I was wondering if anyone could recommend an amazing baby shower gift for twins.&nbsp; I have a friend who is having a very difficult pregnancy with twins.&nbsp; Her registry lists two of everything.&nbsp; I was wondering if there is a specific twin-related gift that would be unique or fabulous besides the usual two-of-everything thing.&nbsp; Any ideas?

				As a mother of (now 37-year old) twins, I would buy her a chalkboard to hang on the wall in the nursery. She can place a tape down the middle to divide it into 2 and write (andd check off) their individual feeding schedules, and copy it to her daily log during nap timeâ€”if she ever gets them to nap at the same time! Also get her a couple of rolls of color masking tape. She will need to mark one of the babies stuff. Bottles especially. If they are on the same formula, it would be a miracle. Advise her not to kill herself trying to breast feed. She will end of in the hospital from exhaustion. I sometimes used to roll up a diaper to prop a bottle when they both were hungry at the same time, but I understand there is a little gizmo that someone makes to do the job. Get her one or two of those.

				Holy crap! I had no idea you had twins!&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp; You amaze me more every day.<br /><br />She&#039;s already enrolled in a breast-feeding class.&nbsp; I hadn&#039;t thought of things to keep them separate and organized. That&#039;s a good idea.&nbsp; <br />

				One other thing that I feel the need to say. Tell her other friends that she is having 2 babies. No matter if they are same sex or opposite sex, fraternal or identical, they are 2 separate little human beings. Don&#039;t buy them matching outfits. Let them learn right from the start that they are individuals and hopefully their Mom and Dad will learn to treat them as such. My boys have such different tastes in everything from food to clothes because I worked at allowing them their individuality.
