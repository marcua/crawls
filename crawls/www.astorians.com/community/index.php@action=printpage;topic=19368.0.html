				How many elections do you expect to win with a person who wants to send the poor people to camps to teach them hygiene?<br /><br />Because we know that all poor people in NYC are that way because they don&#039;t know how to shower.<br /><br /><br />that is how you win an election?<br /><br />Sending poor people off to a&nbsp; concentration camp....?

				Oh and by the way.....Paladino made his wealth with office towers in Buffalo full of state employees. <br /><br />Can a single GOPer such As FZ or Bill see the Irony of that wealth.<br /><br />Will Paladino cut the budget enough that it will result in empty towers in buffalo?

				Paladino is a wild-eyed fanatic and, like most Republicans, he&#039;d happily roll back decades of progress and bring back the days of debtors prisons. We need Democrats to restore America&#039;s progress and prosperity. Our President succeeds to the degree he shakes off the conservative influence in Washington and takes a stand for ordinary Americans. Cuomo will succeed by the same measure in Albany.<br /><br />On the plus side, you conservatives are really doing the country a favor by nominating nutjobs like Paladino and O&#039;Connell in Delaware. Please keep it up--extremist lunacy like yours is destroying the GOP. You can enjoy a lot of electoral success this year but you don&#039;t have a shot for NY&#039;s governorship and your wackadoo nonsense is going to bury you in the long term. Thanks for the laughs, don&#039;t let the door hit you on the way out!

				So Republicans vote for the imperfect different, while Democrats ride the same brain dead incumbents. Paladino deserves to win the Republican primary simply because he is not Rick Lazio. He deserves to be the next governor because he is not Cuomo. The term &quot;progressive&quot; is a perfect Orwellian example of the perversion of the English language. Progressive to what? More subservience to our political betters. <br />In this state, I will vote for anyone who is not an incumbent. In this district, the Socialists (or Progessives you choose) just renominated an incumbent who has provided aid and comfort to the corrupt, while prospering from their fund raising. She has voted on bills that she has not read, which affect every citizen (most negatively). She has accomplished nothing of import. (Spare me the credit card stuff, I defy you to find a handful of non-political people who were helped by this).<br />All the while supporting insane, economy bashing measures like card check and cap-and-trade.<br /><br />I dread the upcoming Republican majority in the house, because I don&#039;t think they got it through there heads that the nation is screaming, &quot;DO LESS, SPEND LESS&quot;. The only thing I dread more is the &quot;progressives&quot; having anymore say in anything that has to do with the economy.

				I&#039;m a progressive because I&#039;m an American and America has always striven to move forward toward a more perfect embodiment of our core values. I grew up in a country with the progressive values that tell me we&#039;re all in this together and everybody benefits when everybody pitches in. These progressive American values are about making sure people who play by the rules have a chance to go as far as they can in life. They&#039;re also about making sure people who don&#039;t play by the rules don&#039;t get an unfair advantage. Progressives know you don&#039;t let the fox guard the hen-house and we know you don&#039;t let corporations regulate themselves.<br /><br />We remember from history class that the Progressive Era expanded the freedoms enshrined in our Constitution and brought women the vote and protected children from being put to work. Progressive reforms continue to protect our families from unknowingly buying spoiled or unsafe food and when regressive conservatives roll back these protections, we see salmonella outbreaks.<br /><br />So if you&#039;re against all that, I don&#039;t know what you are. But if you&#039;re for bedrock American values like fairness and justice and caring for your neighbor, well then you&#039;re a progressive like me.

				Carl Paladino is not a bad guy... and I say this as a social progressive. A friend of mine knows him very VERY well personally. The reality is, the guy isn&#039;t a politician. He&#039;s not polished, he&#039;s rough around the edges, and he doesn&#039;t speak in sound bites given to him by his PR people. He says what&#039;s on his mind, not what he thinks people want to hear just to get their vote. He is a businessman, and yes, he&#039;s gotten some great government contracts, but he&#039;s gotten them because he&#039;s consistently been a low bidder for projects and is just good at what he does. The man is self-made and painfully honest -- often to his detriment. <br /><br />The media loves to make him seem like a buffoon, because they only pick up the bits and pieces that will make for good ratings. Fiscally, he&#039;s got some great ideas and he wouldn&#039;t be beholden to special interests. Socially, yeah, he&#039;s a bit ass backward. <br /><br />What it&#039;ll come down to is what&#039;s important to people... vote for a candidate that may really shake things up in Albany because he&#039;s not part of the establishment, and may be the first shot at actually fixing what has been a very broken system for a very long time, even though you may not agree with him on social issues; or vote for the candidate who is just another cog in the Albany machine because he&#039;s in line with your positions socially?<br /><br />I can honestly say I&#039;m not really sure who I&#039;ll vote for come November.

				He takes government money to fill up his office towers and in the process gets rich and then attacks government spending.....<br /><br />It&#039;s a juxtaposition that I just can&#039;t understand. <br /><br />For me, if you make yourself rich sucking on the government teat......don&#039;t run a campaign threating to cut off the nipple.....that you sucked on.<br /><br />Personally, I don&#039;t know his stand on gay marriage. <br /><br />I won&#039;t vote for him because of the racist emails he forwarded (that tells me alot about his character). And because his solution to poverty is to send poor people to camps to teach them to wipe their asses.<br /><br />That being said.....I&#039;m not really an Andrew Cuomo supporter. He is not that impressive to me. <br /><br /><br />Albany is corrupt....and I don&#039;t see Cuomo changing it.......and Paladino seems like a bull in a china shop that will just make the legislature circle round and protect itself. <br /><br />I wish one party had put forward a true reformer.......<br /><br />Instead, I feel like I am watching Spitzer: round 2.<br /><br /><br />Looks like I&#039;ll be voting Green or Libertarian this time around.

Although the group had no apparent problem with the anti-gay remarks, they did ask the candidate to strike a paragraph referring to the Ground Zero mosque, explaining that they did not wish the word &quot;mosque&quot; to be spoken there.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/paladino_says_homosexuals_dysfunctional_gUvEfEIg7TCg5x2He3pLLO?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME= (http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/paladino_says_homosexuals_dysfunctional_gUvEfEIg7TCg5x2He3pLLO?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=)

				He has a really strange campaign strategy.&nbsp; Gay-baiting, thankfully, doesn&#039;t work well electorally statewide in NYS and it&#039;s not going to help him.&nbsp; What a jerk.

				He talks out of both sides of his mouth - he wants to put the beat down on Albany, but at the same time doesn&#039;t like how the press is treating him.&nbsp; Waah, waah, waaaaaaaaaah!&nbsp; He can dish it out but he can&#039;t take it.&nbsp; Ugh, what a loser.

				It&#039;s really interesting to watch Palladino weave today trying to spin away his remarks yesterday.&nbsp; He was very explicit in condemning LGBT people and saying we were both dysfunctional, should not be an example and are not a valid &quot;lifestyle&quot;, and then today on NY1 he says I am 100% in favor of gay rights, just not the right to marry.&nbsp; Does he even think before he opens his mouth?&nbsp; It&#039;s really disturbing.&nbsp;

				So let&#039;s recap the interesting gay week of Carl Paladino.<br /><br />1. Carl Paladino reads a speech given to him by an Orthodox Rabbi that contains anti-gay language. <br /><br />2. News gets out and people get mad. <br /><br />3. Carl tries to defend himself by further bashing gays and attacking Cuomo.<br /><br />4. Carl&#039;s gay nephew comes out and says he is pissed at his Uncle.<br /><br />5. Word gets out that two gay clubs in Buffalo resided in Paladino properties.....including one run by his son William.<br /><br />6. Carl apologizes.<br /><br />7. And to top it off....then the Rabbi, who wrote the speech that caused all this uproar, WITHDRAWS HIS ENDORSEMENT!<br /><br /><br />What a effing week.
