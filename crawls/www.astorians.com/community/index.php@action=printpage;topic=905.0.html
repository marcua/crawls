				I have been paying attention to this thread (http://forums.egullet.org/index.php?showtopic=72874) on eGullet.<br />Now that I'm living in Astoria, anything on there that mentions Astoria catches my eye. &nbsp;The people who have been eating there have been saying a lot of good things about this place (its sister restaurant is the well-praised Sabor Tropical, also in Astoria), and how it is an excellent <em>rodizio</em> experience. &nbsp;I must admit, my interest is piqued. &nbsp;I would love to try it with friends sometime. &nbsp;Is anyone game? &nbsp;It's just over on 30th Ave. between 37th and 36th Streets.

				i am so down. these are my people and if they do a good job, im all over it. -the key is to not eat ANYTHING else, dont go to the buffet... there are some awesome cuts of meat. i've been to other rodizio's and you really have to find one done well to really get the best out of it. But im game to try them out. (best part is, since im portuguese, i can tell you if they are talking smack behind our back!!!)<br /><br />hahaha<br />flooz

				nah, fado is very portuguese not really brazilian. they would have more upbeat stuff or very smooth stuff like jazzy kinda (if you saw the life aquatic, the dude that sang all the pop hits in portuguese, that was awesome)<br />me and my better half will be there with empty bellies!<br /><br />*note to the squeamish, there usually is a tasty dish involving weird animal parts*

				I got up this morning early specifically to run off some of that meat I ate last night! &nbsp;Wow, it was good. &nbsp;Really delicious and of course my favorite was that which was wrapped in bacon (no surprise there). &nbsp;The caiphirihas (did I spell that correctly?) were awfully strong but awfully tasty. &nbsp;Nice sides of fried yucca, plaintain, and fantastic beans and rice! &nbsp;I thought there were just out of this world, and paired with the cucumber/pepper/vinegary condiment, it made for a really fantatastic side. &nbsp;The farofa (sp?) was really interesting and I liked it very much with the meat. &nbsp;There were these little balls of yummy bread, too, that I thought were really great. &nbsp;Nice salad bar and everything was pretty fresh there. &nbsp;And dessert was fun! &nbsp; Flan, etc. &nbsp;I loved hearing all the Brasilian Portuguese being spoken here and there during the meal (I think it's a lovely sounding language). &nbsp;All in all a really delicious meal, and the experience was just amplified by being there with a group of friends. &nbsp;It was wonderful to see you all and share a meal together. &nbsp;Looking forward to the next one!
