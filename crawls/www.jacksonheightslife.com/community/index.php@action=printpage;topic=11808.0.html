				Are you currently trying to sell your home or thinking about listing your home for sale?&nbsp; Do you have a broker?&nbsp; If so, are they doing everything they can to sell your apartment?&nbsp; If they aren’t properly representing you, would you be able to tell?&nbsp; <br /><br />http://coopercooper.com/sellingseminar<br /><br />Jackson Heights is quickly becoming one of NYC&#039;s &quot;it&quot; neighborhoods.&nbsp; However, buyers looking to move to our beloved Jackson Heights find it very difficult to find listings and visit properties for sale; especially when represented by a broker.&nbsp; The lack of transparency and unwillingness to “co-broke” with a buyer’s broker is depressing the sales prices in our neighborhood, extending the time on the market and thereby hurting all of us who have chosen to invest in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; We can and should be seeing the increases that Brooklyn and other areas of Queens have seen over the past several months.&nbsp; Why aren’t we?<br /><br />As an owner, you should expect that your listing broker is doing EVERYTHING they can to sell your home.&nbsp; After all, that is why you are paying them several thousand dollars, correct?&nbsp; Additionally, you should be prepared to pay your broker a commission which allows them to market, advertise and invite represented buyers to view and bid on your home.&nbsp; Believe it or not, choosing to “save” a couple percentage points on the broker’s commission is a mistake.&nbsp; You force your broker to only accommodate and entertain offers from direct buyers (unrepresented), and eliminate the possibility of receiving offers from qualified, represented buyers.&nbsp; If your broker tells you that buyers are paying their brokers directly so you don’t need to, they are not being truthful!<br /><br />Cooper &amp; Cooper Real Estate is a highly rated and well-respected brokerage firm in NYC which has developed a Selling Seminar to educate sellers on all they should know before listing their apartment or home with or without a broker in NYC.&nbsp; Their next seminar will be held at the InterContinental Hotel in Midtown Manhattan (44th and 8th Ave) and you are invited!&nbsp; You can RSVP for a complimentary ticket with the <strong>PROMO CODE EG414</strong> at www.CooperCooper.com/SellingSeminar.&nbsp; C&amp;C’s VP and Director of Operations, Eirik Davey-Gislason, is a JH resident and proud member of the JH community.&nbsp; He will be there to answer any questions you may have regarding your current or future listing.<br /><br />If you are currently selling or thinking about selling an apartment, you need to be educated on the process and know what questions to ask your broker to ensure they are representing your best interests.&nbsp; <br /><br /><strong>WHEN:</strong><br />Thursday, April 23rd, 2014<br />6:30pm: Registration / Reception<br />7:00pm: Presentation, Followed By Q&amp;A<br />*Refreshments will be served<br /><br /><strong>WHERE:</strong><br />InterContinental Hotel<br />Times Square<br />300 West 44th Street (@ 8th Avenue)<br />Washington Square Park Room, Lobby Level<br /><br /><strong>RSVP:</strong><br />Kindly RSVP at: CooperCooper.com/SellingSeminar<br />[ Reference Promo Code: EG414 ]<br /><br /><br />http://coopercooper.com/eirikgislason<br />http://coopercooper.com/sellingseminar<br />
