				Julieta, &quot;El Ristorante del Amor,&quot; has signs up at 37-63 81st Street and is looking ready to open soon!&nbsp; I can&#039;t find any further information on them.

				There&#039;s a new place called Julietta (if memory serves me) that is &quot;coming soon&quot; on 81st just off of Roosevelt.&nbsp; Anyone know anything about this new restaurant?

				the signs have been up for eight or so months (at least) and the building has been almost-complete&nbsp; for many years. i&#039;m not hopeful about a quick answer, but it&#039;s certainly a Latin place. maybe a sitdown, considering size and such?

				true, but the &quot;El&quot; and &quot;Del&quot; point towards Latin. maybe an old-school Argentinian-Italian hybrid -- La Portena used to have great pastas.

				I saw that for the first time the other day. But if nothing at all has happened for many months, it&#039;s hard to believe something will actually happen. So weird how incredibly long it takes some of these places to actually arrive, while others seem to come quickly, like the new Chinese place in the Bruson Building.

				I walked by the forthcoming Julieta&#039;s earlier, and noticed that they&#039;re still displaying a &quot;coming soon&quot; sign.&nbsp; Here&#039;s a photo of the facade:<br /><br />(https://i.imgur.com/gRTKXkN.jpg)
