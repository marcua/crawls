				My husband and I are looking to buy in Jackson Heights, but we&#039;ve got a large (~80 pound) dog who I fear might become an issue when it comes to getting board approval. Does anyone know of co-ops in the neighborhood that seem big-dog friendly?<br />Thanks!

				in the hopes of contributing &quot;addition by subtraction,&quot; i can advise you to eliminate the Warwick. Our board outlawed dogs of all sizes a few years ago.

				^^If you have a realtor who knows the neighborhood well, he/she should be able to give you an idea of the buildings that are good with bigger dogs. PM me and I&#039;ll be happy to give you a recommendation for the agent we used who seemed super informed.<br /><br />When I looked I had a cat and no interest in a bigger dog so I can&#039;t offer much advice. There does seem to be a fair number of bigger dogs in the neighborhood though, so I&#039;m hopeful for you the ones I see don&#039;t all live in the same building near me. :)

				come to think of it, i&#039;ve seen street friends - you know, the people you see daily and stop to chat with, though you&#039;re not super close - take dogs into Hawthorne Court.

				In addition to those named above, here are some other dog-friendly buildings in JH.&nbsp; As a dog owner myself, I&#039;m sensitive to this issue, and always ask potential buyers about their pets.&nbsp; I would argue that buildings that allow dogs benefit as far as higher prices -- after all, if you lose the dog-owner as a potential buyer, your &quot;demand&quot; decreases.<br /><br />The Berkeley allows dogs with no size restriction.&nbsp; So do the Wilshire and Somerset.&nbsp; As do some of the Hampton and Linden Cts.&nbsp; And these also allow dogs of any size:&nbsp; Elbertson, Fildor Hall, Roosevelt Terrace, the Belvedere and both Belvedere East and West.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t have a realtor who knows the rules, one way to find out by yourself is to go to the websites for the various Management Companies -- Lovett, Metro, Wavecrest, etc. and search for the House Rules.&nbsp; These typically contain all the things you want to know about pets and other issues.&nbsp; You can also search the address on Streeteasy, and see if pets are or are not allowed.&nbsp; (This won&#039;t give you any size limit, but it&#039;s a decent way to begin your search.)

				if you search for JH listings on streeteasy.com you can search for buildings that allow pets. That can give you a good idea.
