				Hello everybody! I wanted to take a moment to share a very touching story which we just published. <br /><br />--<br /><br />Buyer Goes Above and Beyond to Bring Seller Closure<br /><br />It was one of the most touching and gratifying experiences in our years of practice. Our seller client, initials JT, enlisted our help in selling her late mother’s apartment in Jackson Heights. She had many memories connected with the apartment and the sale was an emotional experience for her on many levels.<br /><br />We found her a great buyer, initials RK, who planned a complete renovation of the apartment, which it certainly needed. What made this special was that the new buyer, RK, went out of her way to invite us and the seller to see the apartment post renovation and allow the seller to have complete closure and assurance that the home fell into the right hands. It was visible how healing this experience was for JT!<br /><br />I can’t begin to tell you how emotionally gratifying this was for all of us. It was only fitting that we took everyone out to lunch and celebrate the fact that such things still exist in our world, and more so right here in Jackson Heights.<br /><br />It’s been an honor and a privilege to be part of this experience!<br /><br />Link to the original article:<br />http://www.jacksonheightslistings.com/buyer-goes-above-and-beyond-to-bring-seller-closure/ (http://www.jacksonheightslistings.com/buyer-goes-above-and-beyond-to-bring-seller-closure/)<br />

				That&#039;s a touching story, these things can really mean a lot to people. Some years ago, I had a house that I cared deeply about and had put a lot of blood, sweat and tears into improving.&nbsp; It was very important to me that the place went to people who loved it as much as I did.
