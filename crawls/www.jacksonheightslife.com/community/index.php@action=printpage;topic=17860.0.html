				My siblings and I planning to buy a 1br or studio coop for our mom, she is in her late 70s. She doesn&#039;t drive and most of her friends are in NYC, so moving here is best option for her. The 4 of us will chip in, we won&#039;t need a mortgage or anything. I am just wondering if there is any issues with this. I know a some coop allow parent to buy coop for their kids and needs few extra requirements. <br /><br />My mom is retired already and her social security check won&#039;t cover much either, we will pick up the maintenance fee etc. As most coop require you have income and ability to pay the coop maintenance fee. Anyone dealt with this before or any suggestion what we can do. We thinking one of us will put our name down on the coop as well, but I already live in a coop of my own, and my other sibling all have their own houses as well. So we not sure if putting our name down is good idea since it won&#039;t be our primary residence.

				It probably depends on the coop board in each building right? <br /><br />You might just have to provide the financial information for everyone involved&nbsp;

				Jack.&nbsp; I&#039;ll share with you an unbelievable experience I had selling my one bedroom cooperative in a 30 unit building in 2006 in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; At the time, there were 10 seniors (65+) several with serious health &amp; mental issues living in the building everyone of us owners.&nbsp; The Board President (59 years old) told me, &quot;We have too many seniors living in the building and we don&#039;t need anymore.&nbsp; Make sure you sell to some under age 50 or your buyer will be rejected.&quot;&nbsp; At the time, I was senior.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t give it to a Realtor, so I listed the unit in the NY Times in June 2006 (HOT Market) and sold it in just one week at full price to a divorced 40 year old male who was immediately embraced by the President.&nbsp; I doubt if this building was the only one that discriminated against seniors and I&#039;m certain they still do exist in 2018.&nbsp; <br /><br />I moved to a larger and much nicer apartment nearby and had no trouble since I was an entry level senior (not anymore). <br /><br />I admire you and your siblings for caring so much about your Mom and wanting to make sacrifices but why a cooperative and not a rental.&nbsp; With a rental its so incredible simple.&nbsp; You pay first and last months rents, sign a lease and you&#039;re handed the keys.&nbsp; Landlords who lease don&#039;t live on premises and don&#039;t care about renting to a senior.&nbsp; So you have NO stress.&nbsp; If for any reason your Mom at the end of the year doesn&#039;t like the building or apartment you look for another one.&nbsp; So easy.&nbsp; <br /><br />Whatever your decision is, I wish you and Mom the very best.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you go thru with purchasing consult with an Attorney in JH&#039;s who is a senior (60+) who specializes in Real Estate Closings.&nbsp; The lawyer who just did my WILL in February is the person you need.&nbsp; He not only represents buyers &amp; sellers but is an attorney for many Cooperatives in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; I would be happy to email you his name and telephone number.&nbsp; His office is above Capital One Bank on 82nd Street &amp; 37th Ave.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Again, the very best.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				This is an interesting question for we seniors who might be interested in moving someday. Regarding rentals, I wonder: don&#039;t landlords nowadays have strict income requirements before they will give you a lease? But I imagine you would get around that by signing on as guarantors--you and your siblings. I remember reading about a retired woman who moved back to NYC after living someplace else for decades, had a lot of cash from a house sale to buy a coop outright, but still had trouble because she had no income other than social security, I believe. There was some sort of answer to her dilemma--but what it was I don&#039;t recall. That was Manhattan, however, and the requirements to buy a coop would be much higher, the higher priced the coop. I think buying for a retired parent might be tricker than buying for a grown child. I&#039;d be interested in how this works out, and what you discover about this.

				Yes, we did consider about rental too, but we not sure how will rent fluctuate from year to year. Verse paying maintenance fee that are somewhat consistent. And is renting for 10 yr, 15 yr, 20+ yr a better option than just buy the coop.<br /><br />Yeah I heard a few of these crazy stories from my friends and coworkers where they got rejected by the boards for no reason. And they didn&#039;t provide any reason at all.<br />

				What you&#039;re proposing is pretty complex and maybe the way to go is to have a real estate broker show you investment co-ops properties that you can rent out long-term. That would allow you and your siblings to be the owners and ``rent&#039;&#039; to your mother. The problem with doing this in non-investment co-ops is, first, you&#039;d have to know whether the co-op even allows such arrangements *before* you even bid. My guess is many co-ops would probably discourage this arrangement for several reasons. The main issue in a co-op is who owns the shares and whose name is on the proprietary lease. In your case, I doubt they would allow your mother to be the ``owner&#039;&#039; given her resources and I doubt they would allow you just to put your name on the lease without residing there. But I do wonder whether you can as serve as her guarantor. To make that work you&#039;d probably need a real estate attorney to draft a rider to the purchase contract that makes you the responsible party for the co-op. It&#039;s all very tricky and you&#039;d want to start out with a broker who knows a lot about the buildings in the area. Brokers will know which boards are more lenient and/or flexible than others. Good luck.

				Also, coops are not only concerned with owners being able to pay the maintenance (which can and does go up over time) but also with owners having sufficient resources to pay any assessments that might come up for needed repairs or building upgrades. That&#039;s why they look at your overall financial picture, assets, etc. I think they might shy away from a situation where several children are chipping in for a parent. The children would have to be the official owners, I think, and if there are several, that makes the situation more complicated in case there are assessments--who is responsible, and what if the children experience financial problems and the coop has trouble getting the money owed for an assessment? That&#039;s why coops are so fussy about the finances of buyers. If there is a problem, the coop is stuck, because it&#039;s a costly and lengthy process to evict someone who cannot pay what is required. And then the financial burden falls on the other owners. Condo&#039;s might be easier to get into on this basis--you should check into that. There are not very many condos in JH, but there are some, and there may be some in nearby neighborhoods as well. But the poster who mentioned investment properties is probably on the best track.

				Thanks for all the replies.<br /><br />We actually did look into 2 coops, first one pretty much discouraged it and second one I told the seller agent situation and they said most likely not ideal either since I already lived in another coop.<br /><br />Our mom&#039;s younger sister actually in the same situation 2 yrs ago, she got rejects on few coops too. She ended up buying a one bedroom condo instead, but she was hoping to have some of the money she sold from her house for retirement but ending up spending most.<br /><br />Yes, condo is ideal, since we could rent it out afterward, but most the one we looked at (outside JH) is double the price which will requires us to get mortgage which seem like another mess and complication to deal with.

				Offer to put two years worth of maintenance in escrow.&nbsp; This will address any underlying concern with regards to non-payment of maintenance/taxes.&nbsp; If that does not work, 2-years and a guarantor should do the trick.&nbsp; The escrow without the guarantor worked for someone I know.&nbsp; I think the key is for the purchaser to make the suggestion because there is no incentive for the coop to make the suggestion because it could lead to litigation.&nbsp;

				Dear all, the answer to this is quite simple actually. First I want to point out that age discrimination by board or a licensee is a Fair Housing Law violation, based on amendment passed in 1988. Therefore anyone of status, or licensee of the state pushing back based on age of an applicant is in violation of federal law. <br /><br />Now to the matter at hand. Every applicant must meet basic income and credit requirements of a coop or a lender. Refusal based on income amount (not based on occupation ) is normal and logical. Therefore incomes and assets of siblings will play the necessary role. The ways you&#039;d structure a deal like siblings buying for a parent are: <br /><br />1. Co-purchase, where all parties are owners and proposed shareholders and parent is the main occupant and all are applicants<br /><br />2. Siblings buy in their name only and name mother as authorized occupant, therefore only siblings are applicants<br /><br />NOTE, you must check every coop&#039;s purchasing guidelines. More in my experience will allow co-purchase, less will allow option 2 of siblings buying in their name only with an authorized purchaser. If their rule guidelines specifically state that the occupant must be sole purchaser, then that makes it known to all across the board where the building stands.<br /><br />I hope this is helpful.<br /><br />Warmly,<br />Armen

				A few of things:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Co-ops are not required to give a reason for rejecting someone, and I know of none that do;<br /><br />2.&nbsp; Most Co-ops in the neighborhood do not permit subletting, and having children purchase an apartment for their parent, who will reside in the apartment, would be considered a sublet;<br /><br />3.&nbsp; While most Co-ops permit parents purchasing an apartment for their children (mine does not), the application typically lists only the children as shareholders, with the parents putting up the purchase money.&nbsp; The Board then looks to see if the kids are able to afford the maintenance on their own -- without the parents&#039; help.&nbsp; This may be difficult in the case of your mother.&nbsp; <br /><br />4.&nbsp; While a Co-op cannot discriminate based on age or source of income, the Board can decide that the arrangement proposed -- having all the kids act as guarantors -- is objectionable where the actual resident is unable to afford the maintenance.<br /><br />It will be difficult to buy a cooperative apartment in the manner that you have proposed.&nbsp; I know that condominiums are more expensive, but that may very well be your best bet.&nbsp; Plus - if the apartment becomes vacant for any reason in a down market, you will be able to rent a condominium unit until the market swings back up, whereas you may be stuck with either a loss or years of carry charges for an unoccupied cooperative that does not permit sublets.<br /><br />Last thought - have a well-funded trust created for your mother&#039;s benefit purchase the apartment.&nbsp; The trust will be the shareholder and your mother will sign an occupancy agreement to occupy the apartment.&nbsp; Manhattan buildings have been permitting this arrangement more and more, but not sure about this neighborhood.<br /><br />Good luck and let us know what happens.

				Thanks Armen, that is every helpful. I think that is why the agent discourage us since I told her I also have a coop, which they assume I have mortgage etc.<br /><br />Wilrfan, condo is the best option, but then we will have to do mortgage which is another mess having 4 individual agrees on what to do and who to take the mortgage. And there isn&#039;t much Condo in JH either.<br />

				Welcome! <br /><br />You or your siblings carrying a mortgage on another coop you own (or any other type of property for that matter)&nbsp; should not be an issue as long as your income and your siblings income combined is sufficient to carry your respective obligations and the proposed monthly maintenance on coop you want your mother to live in. <br /><br />Deals that are slightly out of the box may at a glance seem complicated, but at the end it comes down to the same approval guidelines. Yes it will be more paper-heavy than a deal with less purchasers involved. But with no mortgage (as you proposed), a coop has first position lean on the property and complete leverage on all shareholders. Barring specific rule forbidding co-purchase, this is a perfectly doable deal. <br /><br />It is completely true that a board can and may turn down an application without giving a reason. Yet fear of board turn down should not be a reason not to seek a housing alternative that makes most financial and practical sense. That risk and many other risks exist in real estate regardless of a buyer profile.

If you list income and assets on the offer form, you must be able to show proof. Same way you are entitled to seeing the physical property and reviewing building financials before submitting your offer. In the initial screen we generally advise that you redact social security numbers and account numbers from statements. <br /><br />To be perfectly clear, you don&#039;t HAVE to provide them, but in my experience, sellers are more likely to accept an offer that has attached proof of income and assets. In some cases sellers may even accept a slightly lower offer that is better prepared, than one that is higher but shows reluctance to show proof. It&#039;s important to understand, that a seller is not only looking at price, but also your ability to put together documents and to pass the board in their building. In these cases, less is not more.<br /><br />Now, (regardless of coop or condo) if we are discussing your specific case, of you and your siblings buying together, you must have the entire proposed deal structure and documents ready in folder at all times. You must properly educate the listing agent on what you intend to do and how, so they can confidently relay it to the seller. This includes names of purchasers, their respective income assets and proof there of when call upon. <br /><br />Remember, <span class="bbc_u">price is not the offer</span>. Offer is comprised of several factors - <strong>Price, Down Payment, Financing, Conditions, Contingencies, Qualifying Factors</strong>. Always ask yourself, if you were the seller, what would you need to know to make an educated decision who to go into a deal with. <br /><br />

				I&#039;ve known seniors who downsized from elsewhere using the money from the sale of their previous home to make an all cash offer. Of course, that requires their previous home to have sold enough to afford a coop here. In those instances, these are folks with zero debt, so of course their debt : income ratio met any board requirement.<br /><br />Social security, pension, and investment income is income, so if the senior has enough money in the bank and the carrying cost (maintenance) : income ratio was met financial requirements would be met overall. If there isn&#039;t enough money in the bank to meet board requirements after closing, children should be able to gift that money (with perhaps a legal document to the board attesting the money is a gift and not a loan.)<br /><br />I commend you for thinking ahead jackinjh. Your mother absolutely could live another 20 years, and I&#039;d guess you&#039;re looking at family history of longevity as well as being mindful that your mother is likely to live longer than her parents.&nbsp; My siblings and I are having these kinds of discussions with our own mother at the moment (which I wish we had started a decade ago), and while she doesn&#039;t particularly enjoy contemplating how many years she may have left on this planet (and nor do we), in order for her to have a decent quality of life as she continues to age it has to be done.
