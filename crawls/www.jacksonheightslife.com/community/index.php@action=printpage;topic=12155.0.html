				Hi all, Does anyone have suggestions for the best butchers, or places to find high quality meats in Jackson Heights or Elmhurst? If possible, I like to buy local and/or organic/grassfed. I often find myself going to Wholefoods in Manhattan, but I&#039;d prefer to support a neighborhood establishment if one exists. I sometimes go to the carniceria on 37th ave and 80th (or 81st?); anyone know anything about their sources? <br />Thanks in advance!<br /><br />

				Yes, the Greenmarket is great. It&#039;s pricey, for sure, but not that different from what you&#039;d pay for similar meat (e.g., grass-fed) at Whole Foods. I&#039;ve been getting beef from Sun Fed beef for a couple of years now and the quality is outstanding. There are also duck, turkey, pork, seafood, and sometimes chicken vendors at the Greenmarket. Most of the meat vendors are there year-round. The only potential downside is that it requires some planning (can&#039;t just run down the street the day you decide to make burgers!).

				all the meat purveyors at the greenmarket are terrific, but i especially like the duck. it&#039;s harder to find than other meats, and they have terrific products. the cheese merchant - consider bardwell - has veal from time to time as well.

				Haven&#039;t tried Sun Fed, we get beef, chicken and bacon (eggs too) from SawKill Farms and it&#039;s all been great.<br />http://sawkillfarm.squarespace.com/beans/

				We&#039;ve been buying meat from the Sun/Grass Fed farmer&#039;s market vendor for the past year and have enjoyed the clean taste of their meats.&nbsp; They will also take special requests.&nbsp; I ordered beef tongue and about 20 steaks for a large barbecue.&nbsp; The only thing about the Farmer&#039;s Market is that you can&#039;t get chicken there.<br /><br />As for a butcher, I&#039;ve stopped in the Boina Roja butcher (next to the restaurant) and ended up not buying anything.&nbsp; It smelled a little too gamely for me.&nbsp; For a legit butcher shop I&#039;ve frequented International Meat Market in Astoria, they are fantastic. It&#039;s a little pricey but they have good meats and have some items that are hard to find (e.g., slab bacon, whole rabbit, fresh beef liver cut to order, lamb shoulder &amp; ribs, D&#039;Artagnan foie gras, excellent souvlaki skewers, etc.).&nbsp; They even grind meat for you on the spot.&nbsp; Get there early and get a number, otherwise you&#039;ll be waiting a while.&nbsp; PS, they are closed on Sundays.

				Yeah, it&#039;s only since the advent of factory farming that chicken is no longer a seasonal crop. They&#039;re birds. Birds breed in the spring. Eggs hatch, they grow. So any farm that is truly pasture raising chickens isn&#039;t going to have a bird that&#039;s ready to slaughter until mid to late June, in this part of the country. <br />And, as you say, it&#039;s good chicken.

				It just got me thinking and wondering if anyone knew where&nbsp; there meat from the carniceria on 37th ave and 80th (or 81st?) is sourced from. I always buy shell steak from them and it is always so delicious. <br />

				there are still a few wholesalers in lower manhattan that didn&#039;t get the boot when the meatpacking district became &quot;the meatpacking district.&quot; most restaurants and small butcher shops source stuff there. i know that&#039;s not specific, but it&#039;s a start -- they might be willing to tell, since you and i couldn&#039;t go to one of them and buy a couple of steaks.<br />

I also do not know where they source their stuff and would be curious. <br /><br />Does anyone buy online from any upstate farms? I have googled around a bit, but often farms are cagey with how much their stuff costs and you have to commit a lot of money and likely buy in bulk. <br /><br />I also saw that Fresh Direct was mentioned in a NY Times article...is that stuff noticeably better than the grocery store?

				I buy from the Sun/Grass-fed guy at the Farmer&#039;s Market - he&#039;s cheaper than the grass-fed stuff at the grocery stores and I&#039;ve liked everything I&#039;ve gotten. He also has one of those cards where you get holes punched for everything you buy and then you&#039;ll get a free pound of ground beef after the card is filled. <br /><br />I also buy meat from Fresh Direct - they have a lot of organic and grass-fed options and their prices are the same as the greenmarket or a bit lower.&nbsp; I think the quality is much better than at the grocery stores because Fresh Direct uses local sources. The grass-fed options at FoodTown are ridiculously overpriced.

				we have a high quality cheese purveyor in d&#039;Espana, over on Northern - although their offerings are all Iberian.<br /><br />as far as a neighborhood butcher, i usually end up at either Sun Fed (for beef) or Sawkill (for pork) at the farmer&#039;s market. if you&#039;re willing to travel a little, just a little, Ottomanelli on 61st in Woodside is outstanding -been there for decades, and they are very full service and willing to cut/customize. they also sell wild game of various kinds

				I second Lilybell&#039;s recommendation of the Sungrass guy at the farmer&#039;s market, even though EVERY TIME I&#039;m there, I end up on line behind the same irritating guy who asks question after question about every single cut available as the line grows long behind him.
