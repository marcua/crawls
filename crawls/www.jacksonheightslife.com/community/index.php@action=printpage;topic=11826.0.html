				Dear valued customer,<br /><br />This week&#039;s wine tasting, we will be focusing on Maule Valley, Chile. Maule Valley is the largest wine-producing region in Chile other than the Central Valley, of which it is a part. It has 75,000 acres (30,000ha) under vine, and has traditionally been associated with quantity rather than quality. But this is rapidly changing â€“ the bulk-producing Pais vine is gradually being replaced with more international varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Carmenere with bright acidity and juicy fruit which we will be tasting.<br /><br />Maule Valley was one of the first areas in Chile to be planted to vine, and its viticultural history stretches back to the start of colonisation by the Spanish. The region has long been one of Chile&#039;s most successful bulk-production wine districts, as evidenced by the large amount of Pais still found planted here. It has only been in the past 20 years that Maule vignerons have made a move toward quality, pioneered by the Kendall-Jackson empire of California, which set up a winery here in the mid-1990s.<br /><br />We hope you can join us and let us take you to Maule Valley, Chile!<br /><br />Date: Tomorrow, 4/25 and Saturday, 4/26<br /><br />Taste Time: 6pm to 9pm<br /><br />Complementary cheese will be serve.

				My husband and I went over to the wine tasting on Saturday night. We expected to stay only a few minutes, we ended up staying 90 minutes. This is a great place, decorated wonderfully with wooden shelves and table, very relaxed atmosphere. The owners were extremely nice and friendly. We tried four different wines from Spain and learned a lot. There were about 7 other people there and we made new friends and bought great wine. Needless to say I will be back for another wine tasting.
