				Hello all, I think I am going to buy a unit at Hawthorne Court, facing 76th St and right near 37th Ave. I have done a lot of research and am very excited to live in JH. As the unit is on the ground floor facing the street, however, I suddenly had a concern about possible burglaries.&nbsp; I see there are no bars on the front windows.&nbsp; Would anyone have any comments on this to share with me?&nbsp; Also, should I be concerned about noise from 37th Ave? I don&#039;t know how busy/noisy it can get around that corner of 76th St and 37th Ave.&nbsp; Any thoughts much appreciated.

				i live&nbsp; in the warwick....directly opposite hawthorne, in a ground floor apartment that faces 35 avenue at 76th. i have no concern about breakins, even without bars. the windows are somewhat elevated and set back from the street behind the little front gardens (if i stand on my toes and reach up from directly below the window, i cannot reach it).<br /><br />noise is a little more of an issue. not a lot of foot traffic, not a lot of blaring music from people hanging out, but honking and screeching tires -- we seem to have a LOT of bad drivers -- can get wearing.

				Congrats! we live across the street. You should be fine with safety since many people frequent the street.&nbsp; It&#039;s a relatively quiet street given that there are cars and pedestrians occupying the street and sidewalks.&nbsp; Traffic and noise is pretty okay for being so close to a main avenue and corner.&nbsp; Some noise at night may be some people (possibly drunk) talking loudly passing by, or a car beeping briefly.<br /><br />

				Hi, glad to hear you&#039;re considering making JH and HC your home. <br /><br />I live in HC as well. You will notice that bars are not the norm; those that still exist tend to be remnants of a (luckily) bygone era. It is a pretty safe place to live and it&#039;s definitely more aesthetically pleasing to have no bars on those beautiful landmarked windows. HC is definitely a friendly, community-oriented place, and that helps, because you are not isolated. <br /><br />As far as the noise goes, these are fairly quiet blocks. You are liable to get more noise the closer you are to 37th ave, esp. since 76th Street goes south and you&#039;ll also be closer to the traffic light, but again, noise doesn&#039;t tend to be bad. <br /><br />It&#039;s a great place to live! Good luck! <br />

				Bonjour Carrefour_NY, thank you so much for the lovely and encouraging email. The community aspect accounts for much of what I&#039;m seeking for my new neighbourhood. My fingers are crossed that I get to be your neighbour!
