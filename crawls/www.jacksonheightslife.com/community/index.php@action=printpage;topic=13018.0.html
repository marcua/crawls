				Has anyone used Annie Sloan brand chalk paint for refinishing a piece of furniture?&nbsp; The website makes the process seem easy, but the paint is expensive so before I embark on this project I would like to get an opinion from someone who has used it, pro or con.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				How timely; I am going to use it for the first time over the weekend. I have another brand I&#039;m going to compare it to (can&#039;t remember the name offhand).&nbsp; I&#039;ll post back on Monday!&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t think I would like it for furniture refinishing because it generally gives you the &quot;shabby chic&quot; look and I prefer my painted furniture to be glossy. I guess the pro is you don&#039;t have to sand or prime.&nbsp; I&#039;m using it for a matte base coat that can be stenciled over easily.&nbsp; I&#039;ll keep you posted and might even add a photo if it doesn&#039;t turn out embarrassingly awful.&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve used Miss Mustard Seed milk paint. Yours sounds similar. It&#039;s easy to apply. But you have to be a fan of shabby look as the wood will show through in certain places. I think it could drive you crazy if you are looking for a perfect finish.

				OK, back with my report!&nbsp; I had two different quarts of white chalk paint; the brands are Annie Sloan and Renaissance (I was able to buy Renaissance on Amazon). Both were $35 a quart.<br /><br />I preferred the Renaissance brand, but they are almost the same to be honest. Either would have been fine. I was surprised at the consistency - it was like sour cream or greek yogurt and was the first time in my life I was actually tempted to eat paint. It looked delicious! It was so thick and I barely needed to use any paint (I did two coats). I&#039;m going to do one more coat but I could easily have just done two. I think the Annie Sloan caused more brush marks than Renaissance but after the first coat you don&#039;t see them so it doesn&#039;t really matter.<br /><br />I am now a believer - I don&#039;t think you need to sand or prime when using this (but I had primed the item I painted because I wasn&#039;t expecting to use chalk paint). I was really impressed by the coverage. The finish is very matte. They recommend waxing and buffing afterwards but I did some research and am going to use polycrylic instead (I would like a bit of sheen if possible).&nbsp; <br /><br />Tip: Do not use a roller. Use a brush with natural bristles (manufacturer recommends this as well).&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

				Thanks! You have now given me the &quot;courage&quot; to do this project LOL&nbsp; I am going for shabby chic on a small accent piece and then just painting over a boring and inexpensive desk.&nbsp; Will let you know the results.
