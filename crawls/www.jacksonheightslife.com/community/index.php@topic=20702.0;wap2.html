			this isn&#039;t exactly breaking news, but what was once one of the nicer South Asian restaurants in the neighborhood has morphed into a steam table joint -- one with no posted menu, no less. a far smaller selection than either Raja or Maharaja, but there are meat options.

			Yeah we were disappointed about this, because it was our top choice for Indian food in JH, and it was a nice, sit-down place with an extensive menu. Too bad.
